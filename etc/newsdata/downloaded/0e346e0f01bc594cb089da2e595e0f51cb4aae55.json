He was an ardent civil rights voice who decades ago endured violence from white mobs as he and other African-Americans sought to integrate a public swimming pool.\n\nThe 13-term congressman was credited with helping calm tensions in Baltimore in 2015 when violence erupted following the death of an African-American man in police custody.\n\nHe was a high-profile antagonist of Trump, who reacted to a weekend of deadly violence during a \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Virginia saying there were \u201cvery fine people\u201d on both sides of the demonstrations.\n\nThe funeral was being held in Cummings\u2019 congressional district, which Trump vilified earlier this year as \u201cdisgusting, rat and rodent-infested.\u201d\n\nCummings responded at the time by saying Trump should visit his majority-black congressional district. \u201cI\u2019ll ride with him for hours... I want him to see all of the wonderful things that are happening.\u201d\n\nTrump, who is scheduled to speak at a historically black college in South Carolina, did not plan to attend the funeral, the White House said on Thursday. No information was available as to whether he had been invited, and it was not clear if other administration officials would attend.\n\nSlideshow (28 Images)\n\nU.S. race relations are sure to be a contentious topic during the upcoming 2020 presidential election season in which Democrats aim to unseat Trump.\n\nThey hope to win over the votes of African-Americans who could play an important role in determining the outcome, along with growing Hispanic communities throughout the United States.\n\nAs chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings before his death led a series of investigations of Trump\u2019s administration and business dealings. He had been a central figure in Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry on the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.", "description": "Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday praised the late Elijah Cummings, a leading force in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, as someone who \"stood against corrupt leadership.\"", "authors": ["Donna Owens", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444904531&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O1AW", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
