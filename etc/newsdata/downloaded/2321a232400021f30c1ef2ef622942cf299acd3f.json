Other managers have recently tried to include provisions for future bond purchases, but the language was scrapped during the marketing process.\n\nThe Volcker Rule is part of the Dodd-Frank Act enacted in response to the financial crisis. It forced CLO managers to avoid purchasing bonds so that banks, such as Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, could continue to buy the debt of CLOs.\n\nRolling back the rule would allow CLOs to purchase bonds, which can have higher yields and could boost returns to the most junior investors, the equity holders, who have seen their income pressured due to wide CLO debt tranche spreads.\n\nEquity holders are paid last with whatever interest is left after all other fund holders are paid. As senior investors take a greater share, distributions to the equity fall. Stronger returns would help boost investment in the riskiest tranche and support continued issuance.\n\nLoans with a B rating had yields of 6.89% in the third quarter compared to 7.27% for high-yield bonds with the same rating, according to Refinitiv LPC data.\n\n\u201cOne of the experiences of the crisis, is that markets saw bank loans and bonds don\u2019t work the same way,\u201d said J. Paul Forrester, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown. \u201cA manager would argue that there is opportunity for an arbitrage pickup by trading bonds, and that bonds are easier to get in and out of, so they can be a more efficient use of cash. Managers may also find better value in bonds.\u201d\n\nSome CLOs during the past year have tried to include some form of a springing-bond bucket provision in deal documents, but some investors have pushed back against the option, he said.\n\nInvestors may balk at including bonds because they are seeking loan-only products and have allocations to high-yield bonds in other funds.\n\nVOLCKER REVISIONS\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) in August said agencies intend to put forth additional, specific changes to restrictions on covered fund investments, which could offer CLOs relief.\n\nAn FDIC spokesperson did not return a telephone call or email seeking comment.\n\nThe loan trade group, the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, sent a letter to regulators last year asking CLOs to be exempt from the covered fund provision.\n\nAfter the Volcker Rule was finalized, managers began to issue deals that either explicitly banned the ability of the fund to purchase bonds or included a springing-bond bucket, which would allow bonds to be purchased if Volcker went away.\n\nRecently, a number of investors have pushed for an all-out ban on bond language in CLO documents.\n\nThe provision in the THL Credit Wind River 2019-2 CLO that priced with Morgan Stanley in September, described as a \u201cVolcker 2.0 Amendment,\u201d has a similar flavor to those 2014 CLOs. The fund has not yet closed.\n\nThe CLO will allow issuers to purchase bonds or receive them in an exchange in the future if the Volcker Rule no longer applies, according to Kevin Lycos, a senior analyst at Fitch.\n\nSpokespeople for THL and Morgan Stanley both declined to comment.\n\nAs the market awaits regulators\u2019 next move, managers may continue to push for optionality.\n\n\u201cThere is always an incentive for managers to have flexibility and equity investors want managers to have that flexibility,\u201d said Kevin Kendra, head of Fitch\u2019s US structured credit group. \u201cThe question is whether debt investors are really willing to accept (bond buckets) or will debt investors feel like they are adequately compensated for allowing that additional flexibility.\u201d (Reporting by Kristen Haunss; Editing by Michelle Sierra)", "description": "The US Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) market is preparing to welcome back high-yield bonds into its funds.
