The competition, which is targeted at computing solutions for global problems, crowned five winners, ranging from first responders to health care info.\n\nPrometeo took the top price for its Watson-based AI solution targeted at firefighters. The team, which is lead by a 33-year firefighting veteran, has developed a tool designed to monitor health and safety in the industry, both long term and in real-time.
