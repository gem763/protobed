Williams initially told the team that he no longer wanted to play for it and asked to be traded June 1, angry about the way its medical staff handled the diagnosis of a growth on his scalp, several people familiar with the situation have said. He had several surgical procedures on the growth and there was fear, at some point, that it was cancerous. Although it was determined to be benign, Williams complained of what Callahan called \u201cdiscomfort\u201d when he tried on his helmet Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWilliams did not come to practice or appear in the locker room after Wednesday\u2019s workout, and he has not spoken publicly about his health or holdout for several months. When asked whether Williams\u2019s discomfort was related to the surgeries, Callahan said, \u201cI imagine so, but I don\u2019t know all the specifics yet.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to leave that to the trainers and doctors and equipment manager and see if they can all get together and formulate a plan of action and go forward from there,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nWhile it remains unclear what caused Williams discomfort, he appeared to be in good condition otherwise. Moses said Williams \u201clooks great\" and is in shape.\n\nAD\n\nThe NFL gave the Redskins a two-week roster exemption for Williams, allowing him time to work his way into shape. But if Williams can\u2019t pass a physical before the roster exemption expires, he can\u2019t be on the 53-man roster and won\u2019t be eligible to play. He probably can\u2019t be placed on the physically unable to play list, either, because that is for players with football-related injuries, and he won\u2019t be eligible for injured reserve because a player must pass a physical to land on that list.\n\nAD\n\nIf he does pass the physical and comes back to play, there is the question of whether he will be able to maintain his status as an unrestricted free agent after the 2020 season. If he does not play eight games \u2014 an unofficial threshold established in 2000 after an arbitrator ruled Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Joey Galloway had to play at least half a season to get credit for a year \u2014 it is possible the Redskins could argue this season shouldn\u2019t count toward Williams\u2019s free agency status, and he should be under contract with Washington through the 2021 season.\n\nNobody seemed to want to address these hypotheticals Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nCallahan, who was Williams\u2019s position coach over the past five seasons, said he had an hour-long talk with the lineman Wednesday in which they \u201cshared a lot of thoughts and conversations.\u201d Callahan described the meeting as \u201can extension of our relationship in the past\u201d but would not reveal details from the chat.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked whether he expects Williams to play for the Redskins again, Callahan said, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that he does.\u201d Asked whether he thinks Williams wants to play football, Callahan nodded.\n\n\u201cI think his heart\u2019s in the right spot. I think Trent loves football,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who loves football more, that\u2019s into it, that studies the game, that gets into the matchups and is challenged by the matchups. There is no question that he has a love and a passion to play football.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWilliams attended position meetings and talked with his teammates Wednesday. He had been in contact with many, including Moses and running back Adrian Peterson, with whom he owns a gym in Houston. Callahan did not say whether Williams would continue to attend meetings or be in the locker room.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a situation that\u2019s taking place,\u201d Moses said of Williams. \u201cHe has to deal with it. I can\u2019t deal with that. He has to deal with that with him and his family and his career. At the end of the day, he\u2019s his own business, so he has to do what\u2019s best for him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWilliams, 31, missed all of the team\u2019s offseason activities, training camp and the preseason before sitting out the first eight regular season games. News of his arrival at the facility Tuesday came minutes after the passing of the trade deadline, ahead of which Washington was in discussions with other teams, most notably the Cleveland Browns, about dealing Williams.\n\nMark Maske contributed to this story.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "Williams experienced discomfort while putting on his helmet, prompting the failed physical Wednesday, after ending his season-long holdout a day earlier.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/pio4o-r4NoUuLY_ghxrtWKH8J5w=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OD475SHZZ4I6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
