Liam Smyth, known as 'Ginge' (right) claimed the man in the yellow polo shirt was bullying his father-in-law who has just recovered from a heart attack in a video he posted to Facebook\n\nLiam Smyth from Shard End, Birmingham, pictured in the video wearing a grey tracksuit, claimed the man was bullying his father-in-law\n\nIn response to the incident, Mr Smyth posted a video to Facebook and claimed the man in the yellow polo t-shirt was bullying his father-in-law, who has just recovered from a heart attack, and said he will not apologise for his actions.\n\nIn the footage, the targeted man, wearing a cotton yellow t-shirt, follows Mr Smyth and keeps smiling.\n\nA smaller grey-haired man shouts: 'You\u2019re a bully, Ginge let me do him, Ginge let me do him.'\n\nMr Smyth clutches the victim's top in his hand and takes a failed swing at him - as he refuses to defend himself and swears at the group instead.\n\nPeople can be heard screaming and a female staff member comes forward to intervene but quickly runs back.\n\nBut this appears to have done little, as moments later the group take their fight to an open space behind the cars.\n\nAs the men go head-to-head outside the Birmingham pub, a female member of staff rushes out to intervene. But after realising the seriousness of the incident, she rushes back\n\nThe victim (pictured in yellow) falls to the ground and gets knocked by the yobs as he tries to stand up again in the Greene King pub car park, in clip uploaded yesterday\n\nMr Smyth punches the man twice in the face, leaving him with blood streaming from his nose. However the man still decides to follow him to the car park.\n\nThe two men shove their hands into each other's face and the victim then calmly stands and watches Mr Smyth pacing on the spot to gear himself up for a fight.\n\nMoments later, a thug approaches the man from behind and gives him a kick in the back and punch in the side of the face which sends him flying on to the road.\n\nThe victim appears to aggravate Mr Smyth by following him back and asking 'is that it?'\n\nPeople have shared their 'respect' for the victim (pictured in yellow t-shirt) who 'took so much and kept his cool'. He was targeted by the men - with one asking him to step aside before Mr Smyth, (pictured left in a grey tracksuit) clutched the man's top in his hand and made a failed swing at him\n\nMr Smyth pulls at the man's top as he staggers to his feet and the pair are joined by another man who climbs over him and beats him side-on.\n\nHe shouts in the man's face 'I promise you' and prods him in the stomach.\n\nMoments later, the camera jumps to the victim and reveals his t-shirt has been sliced, leaving his stomach on display.\n\nPeople took to Facebook to share their respect for 'the big guy' and claimed there was 'only one winner there'\n\nBut even after this battering, the man stays put and does not flee the scene.\n\nIt remains unclear when the incident happened but was uploaded to Facebook with the caption: 'Where's the fair play here?'\n\nDo you know anyone who was involved in the incident? If so, please email phoebe.eckersley@mailonline.co.uk\n\nKelvin Roberts commented on the video: 'Respect to the big guy... took so much and kept his cool... would have been a different story if he had a one on one.'\n\nTony Maughan said there was 'only one winner' in the video with the victim hardly moving and the attackers were 'giving it the bigness as though they're boxers'.\n\nIn a video posted to Facebook, after the fight, by Mr Smyth adds: 'The video is the video but he was bullying old people and I stood up to him. It didn't look too good but I don't really give a f***.\n\n'I'm Ginge from Shard End and I am not apologising to absolutely nobody.'\n\nMr Smyth has been approached for comment from MailOnline.", "description": "A man was punched relentlessly by a group of thugs outside the Hunter's Moon pub in Birmingham, in clip shared on Facebook yesterday.
