It maintained its Canadian projection for 2019 at 1.5 per cent, and dropped its outlook for 2020 slightly to 1.8 per cent. Global trade grew one per cent in the first six months of 2019, in part because of declining car sales. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: The IMF\u2019s growth projection is the worst since the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Canada and Japan were the only advanced economies that the organization did not downgrade for 2019. The former has been spared some of the short-term effects worsening the growth outlook globally. For example, while the IMF estimates Canadian automobile production fell in 2018, it dropped further in China, Germany, Italy and the U.K. But Tuesday\u2019s IMF report also highlighted economic disparities within Canada, which has a larger difference in output per capita between its most and least prosperous regions than many other advanced economies, including the U.S. Bridging such gaps requires national policies that \u201cencourage flexible and open markets, while providing a robust social safety net,\u201d the organization said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
