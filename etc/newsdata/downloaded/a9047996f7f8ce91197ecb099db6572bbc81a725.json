On his decision to withdraw from Syria, Trump said that the U.S. military was \"not a police force.\"\n\nA senior Trump administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said on Tuesday that Pence and others would use the threat of additional U.S. sanctions as leverage in the coming talks with Erdogan's government.\n\nThe crisis began last week when Erdogan told Trump he planned to invade Syria and Trump announced the withdrawal of a small contingent of U.S. troops stationed on the Syria-Turkey border. Trump's decision sparked a bipartisan backlash and international outrage, largely because it seemed to give Erdogan a green light to attack the Kurdish fighters that have been key U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State terrorists in Syria.\n\nTurkey views those Kurdish fighters as terrorists, and Erdogan has long threatened to attack them.\n\nAsked about allegations that the Trump administration has betrayed the Kurds, the senior administration official pushed back sharply, saying the U.S. never promised to defend the Kurds' militarily against a Turkish attack. He said Erdogan signaled that he was going to attack the Kurds whether the U.S. troops were in the way or not.\n\n\"We failed in our mission to deter Turkey from coming in certainly ... but we never told the Kurds that we would use military force\" in a potential clash with Turkey, this official said. The U.S. only withdrew troops from northeast Syria to avoid being caught in the middle of a firefight between those two parties, he said.\n\nIt's far from clear that Turkey would have really gone ahead with its incursion into Syria if not for the U.S. withdrawal. That could have risked a direct confrontation with the world's most powerful military force.\n\nBut now, the Turkish invasion has created chaos in what was a relatively stable region \u2013creating a dangerous opening for Islamic State terrorists to mount a comeback and giving Iran and Russian more influence inside Syria.\n\n\"What Turkey did by going in there was to scramble that entire relatively peaceful, relatively stable basis upon which the international community might find a solution to the larger issues related Syria, beginning with the Syrian civil war,\" the administration official said.\n\n\"It\u2019s dangerous for our troops. It\u2019s placing the fight against ISIS at risk. It\u2019s placing at risk the safe imprisonment of almost 10,000 (ISIS) detainees\" who are being held by the Kurds but now could escape amid the new battlefield chaos.\n\nTrump ordered all U.S. troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria over the weekend. On Monday, he said about 1,000 of the U.S. troops ordered to leave Syria will still remain in the Middle East to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.\n\nTrump said the troops will \"redeploy and remain in the region.\"\n\nA small number will remain at a base in southern Syria to \"monitor the situation\" and prevent a \"repeat of 2014,\" when Islamic State fighters took control of large parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq.\n\nErdogan has not responded to cease-fire demands or the sanctions, although in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal published late Monday, around the time Trump unveiled the sanctions, he wrote that his \"administration concluded that the international community wasn\u2019t going to act, so we developed a plan for northern Syria.\"\n\nThe U.S. sanctions raised steel tariffs on Turkey. Trump also put a freeze on trade negotiations with Ankara and said Monday he would soon sign an executive order permitting sanctions to be imposed on current and former Turkish officials.", "description": "Turkey presses on with its incursions into Syria as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan remains quiet on the Trump\u2019s demand for a ceasefire.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JuGU66ngniwB30Hp0ifRuQ--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/94d5f3bef466aa832d28545d49971d49", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
