All of the comments came from people familiar with the presentations, which ended Tuesday.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones, Steve Cohen Are Wary of Warren\n\nBillionaires Paul Tudor Jones and Steve Cohen joined hedge fund managers Rob Citrone and Jeff Vinik in warning that the stock market would plummet on the prospect of an Elizabeth Warren presidency. The S&P 500 Index will drop about 25% if the Democratic senator wins the 2020 election due to concern over her proposed wealth tax, Jones said.Her self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d opponent, Bernie Sanders, would cause the markets to tumble about 20%, he said.Citing an internal poll at his $8 billion macro hedge fund, Jones also said economic growth in the U.S. would fall to 1% from estimates of more than 2% this year.Steve Cohen said the market would begin pricing in a Warren victory much sooner, tumbling 10% to 15% if she wins the nomination. Cohen added that despite the market\u2019s concern surrounding Warren, some of her more extreme proposals will be difficult to achieve.Cohen sees 2020 as a challenging year to make money given the unpredictability of trading around the election. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to have to grind it out next year,\u201c he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d\n\nBill Ackman, Whitney Tilson on Fannie, Freddie\n\nPershing Square\u2019s Bill Ackman said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mark Calabria should be even more motivated to revamp Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, now that President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election odds are somewhat lower.Separately, Empire Financial\u2019s Whitney Tilson sees Fannie Mae\u2019s intrinsic value reaching $18.50/share, more than six times its recent price. \u201cDon\u2019t get faked out by their congressional testimony last week that spooked investors,\u201d Tilson said, calling it \u201cKabuki theater.\u201d He also expects an IPO sometime next year, in which Fannie exits conservatorship and raises ~$25 billion, but a Democratic president could halt that plan, he said.\n\nLakewood\u2019s Bozza Pitches Shorting Goosehead, Enphase\n\nLakewood Capital\u2019s Anthony Theodore Bozza pitched shorting Goosehead Insurance, Enphase Energy and Kirkland Lake Gold.Bozza set his target for Goosehead at $24/share, less than half of its current value, saying the insurer\u2019s model doesn\u2019t scale and that Texas, its home market, is nearing saturation.Said Enphase\u2019s shipments exceed installations, which isn\u2019t sustainable.On Kirkland, Bozza expects costs to rise and earnings to fall.\n\nBayberry\u2019s Angela Aldrich Sees Upside to WillScot\n\nAldrich pitched WillScot long, seeing upside to earnings from its merger with Modspace, and further upside from rolling out value-added products. She predicts 93% upside over two years.\n\nBluegrass Capital\u2019s Cornell Pitches Black Knight\n\nJoseph Cornell pitched Black Knight as a long, saying Wall Street underappreciates the opportunity in loan origination software. The stock can double in the next three years, he said. The business has limited cyclicality and grew its Ebitda even during the Great Recession, Cornell added.\n\nSachem Head\u2019s Ferguson Is Long on Flex\n\nScott Ferguson pitched Flex as a long idea, saying the stock is not an activist position for him. He attributed the stock\u2019s recent weakness to the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nOther Takeaways:\n\nWhale Rock\u2019s Alex Sacerdote sees the potential for Carvana to triple over the next four to five years.Hunter Capital\u2019s Grant Bowman pitched LexinFintech Holdings as a long, expecting the Chinese online consumer finance firm to earn more than $5 in 2022.Evince Asset Management\u2019s Alberto Musalem suggested a long XLP versus short XLY trade.Nokota Management\u2019s Matthew Knauer pitched IAA as a long, saying he sees upside to $64/share. Long Pond Capital founder John Khoury pitched Vornado as a long, saying he sees 40% upside in the stock. Local market headwinds should be reflected in rents, which have been flat, Khoury said.Center Lake Capital\u2019s Adam Parker made a long call for Coupa Software, saying it could be a $500 stock in five years. The company is likely to trade at least 30 times free cash flow per share, according to Parker, who thinks customers should get immediate cost savings as the average spend per customer has consistently grown.One Tusk\u2019s Vivian Lau was said to pitch Synopsys as a long idea, calling it a \u201chidden gem\u201d in software integrity. The stock has a high-growth total addressable market, she said, expecting shares to hit $170 next year.AltraVue\u2019s DeShay McCluskey was said to pitch the \u201cundervalued\u201d Ferrovial, citing the company\u2019s infrastructure assets.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Robin Hood, which dubs itself \u201cNew York City\u2019s largest poverty-fighting organization,\u201d drew more than 40 investors and policy makers to speak at its two-day annual investor conference.From Paul Tudor Jones expecting the election of Elizabeth Warren to spur a 25% drop in the S&P, to Steve", "authors": ["Anisha Sircar", "Melissa Karsh", "Katia Porzecanski"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DV9RJrrYG.WKkNgxFosX2A--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/d1b1ab0887d18648186652d5e660e18f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
