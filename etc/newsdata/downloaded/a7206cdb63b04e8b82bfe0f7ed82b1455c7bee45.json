T is trading above the rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been climbing higher the past 12 months telling us that buyers of T have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been above the zero line in bullish territory since June and now it is turning to the upside again for a fresh outright buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of T, below, we can see that prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been moving up strong the past year and the MACD oscillator is bullish.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of T, below, we can see the recent price breakout and a new longer-term price target of $60.\n\nBottom line strategy: Traders could go long T here or add to existing longs here. Risk to $36 now with $60 as our longer-term price target.", "description": "Let's drill down on the charts and indicators....T", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Add To Longs On At T'S Upside Breakout", "Let'S Drill Down On The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/740c151c-d31a-11e9-805f-23c76def224a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
