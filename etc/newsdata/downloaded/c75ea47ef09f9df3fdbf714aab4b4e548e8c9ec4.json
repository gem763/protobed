I think Dwight should start entering Harvey's life, it's been years.\"\n\nHarvey has Prader-Willi Syndrome, and is also autistic and partially blind.\n\n\"How long has it been?\" Katie asks Mel, \"Harvey was four when he last saw him.\"\n\n(Image: UK Press via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Rex Features)\n\nMel chimes in: \"Yeah, but how many opportunities have you given him?\"\n\nKatie adds: \"I would love Dwight to come into contact with Harvey. How can you not want to know Harv? He's so funny.\"\n\nKatie's autobiography claims: \"The last time Harvery's biological father Dwight Yorke saw him, which was around eight years ago, the first thing he asked was why was Harvey so big. Why was I overfeeding him?\n\n\"I'd explained Harvey's condition to Dwight many times, but he refused to understand it and kept going on about him being fat.\n\n\"It's sad that he's unable to accept Harvey for who he is and seems unable or unwilling to work within his limitations.\n\n\"On that occasion, I think Dwight wanted to blame someone for the fact that his son is disabled.\n\n\"I have always said that if Dwight could see what a courageous and talented boy Harvey is then he would enjoy being with him so much.\"\n\nKatie also reminds fans to watch out for an official Harvey Price YouTube channel, which is on its way.\n\nShe says: \"So, Harvey's got a YouTube channel coming up. But don't forget me when you're watching.\"", "description": "Katie took to her YouTube channel again, where she dished about her idea of bringing Harvey and dad Dwight together for the first time since the teenager was four years old", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "You Tube", "Katie Price", "Uk Press Via Getty Images", "Rex Features"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10206305.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PROD-Celebrities-at-the-ITV-studios-London-Britain-13-Mar-2015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
