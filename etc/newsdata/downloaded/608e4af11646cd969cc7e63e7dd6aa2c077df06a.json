A bit more fancy, Saturdays spent here usually entails buying overpriced gourmet pizza, some handmade local products and listening to a live band while sipping on a much-deserved pink gin and tonic.\n\nWhile, if you want to go a bit more raw, the Erf 81 market in Tamboerskloof is for you. Close to being called a church bazaar, it is a fresh food market offering local produce with a side of homemade waffles. It's cheap and cheerful and a friendly place for kids to play as animals roam close by on unmanicured lawns.\n\nFrom fancy to rustic, the Oranjezicht City Market is perhaps the perfect mix of the two.\n\nREAD: Linden Market 2019 kicks off + popular Joburg markets to check out\n\nLocated at The Lookout at the V&A Waterfront, vendors open on Saturdays and Sundays to the pure delight of (mostly active/vegan) Capetonians. Sitting by the sea, there is an outdoor seating area with food and produce sold undercover.\n\nExpect patrons to arrive in fitness gear. They'll chow down on gluten-free dishes of tofu and lentil or mushroom sosaties are also a firm fav. Then on their way out, you'll see them grab armfuls of cabbage and asparagus (especially after 2pm when the prices of local fresh produce are slashed) for that evening's din-dins.\n\nBut that's just Cape Town, hey. And we flippin love it.\n\nFor the month of November, the market will be open on Wednesday nights from 4pm to 8pm - so be sure to pay them a visit!\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
