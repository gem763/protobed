To me it was black and white. My building, their tree.\n\n'I rang their insurance department and read the letter his colleague had written and he said, \"we can't be liable because we have not been negligent\".'\n\n'We've had quotes for building to be repaired and together with the ruined tools, it's about \u00a37,000.\n\n'We honestly thought because it was a tree belonging to the council in a pretty Bluebell conservation area used by the local community, there would be no question about them clearing debris and repairing damage to our property.'\n\nThe branches crashed through the couple's roof and incurred damages of more than \u00a37,000\n\nThe houseproud pensioners were distraught to find their outhouse building had crumbled and expensive garden tools and machinery had been destroyed\n\nThe shaken woman added that the tree could have killed her if, as usual, she was in the garden at the time.\n\nShe said: 'Normally we are back and forth getting the mowers out, because it was on Sunday morning.\n\n'Had we been in there we would have been killed.'\n\nThe houseproud couple say repairs to the roof will cost \u00a35,000 and broken tools will cost \u00a32,000.\n\nCaerphilly council has accepted responsibility for the tree - but says it will not pay as the damage could not be foreseen.\n\nAnd it maintains that it is 'continuing to liaise with the property owner.'\n\nA spokesman added: 'Without going into too much detail about this individual case, a local authority is not necessarily liable for damage caused by a fallen tree/branch if reasonable steps are taken to maintain the tree and it is healthy.\n\n'This is a widespread legal position and not just CCBC policy.'", "description": "Alan Muggleton, 70, and his wife Angela, 69, heard branches crash through their storeroom roof after the bough broke off from the conservation area which backs on to their south Wales property.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19987918-0-image-a-18_1571657653894.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
