Officers there initially gave him only ibuprofen to treat the immense pain caused by the gunshot wound.\n\n\"I feared I was going to die,\" Rolando told the Guardian, which withheld his full name due to threats against his life. \"I thought in this country, there is really good medical care... but I wasn't getting any treatment.\"\n\nRolando has routinely been a target for violence for his entire life, according to the Guardian. When he was a baby, his father was killed after resigning from the armed forces and becoming a supporter of the pro-indigenous movement. He said his mother died shortly after \"from the trauma.\"\n\nRolando was shot in the head by the same people who may have targeted his father\n\nWhen he was just a year old, Rolando was given to his neighbors to take care of him. He later became homeless and was frequently targeted by the people who he believes murdered his father, according to The Guardian.\n\nHe said that when he went to the police, they tortured him, placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives.\n\nOtay Mesa2.JPG More\n\nREUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nIn 2016, during a soccer game, he was shot in the head and left with a death threat that included a reference to his father's murder.\n\nUnable to get medical care, Ronaldo had to \u2014 on his own \u2014 remove the bullet from his head.

ICE gave him ibuprofen.\n\nWhile Rolando survived the shooting, he suffered crippling headaches and, at times, blood out of his eyes, ears, and nose. While in the detention center, he would also sometimes lose consciousness. One ER doctor noted in records obtained by the Guardian that Rolando might have a brain hemorrhage.\n\nDespite that, while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, he was offered limited access to medical care.
