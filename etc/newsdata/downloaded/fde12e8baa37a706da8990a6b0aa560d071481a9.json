There\u2019s always so much going on between work, relationships, family, social media, friends, customs and traditions, social obligations and whatnot.\n\nI see people go through a packed day completely drained by the end of it and feeling useless as so much remains undone and there\u2019s almost an irritation, helplessness and anger towards having to put energy and time into people and occasions that distracted then from what they intended to accomplish.\n\nWe all have set goals, a dream future, a bigger picture that excites us, and then there\u2019s the reality of not having the time or support system that enables us to focus on it. We get caught up with guilt that we cannot give our elders or kids the time they look forward to spending with us, guilt at not doing things well because we are always in a rush, guilt at not focusing on our own dreams.\n\nIsn\u2019t it almost always the case that we will compromise on loving or working on ourselves, but almost always make the time to make other people happy? Our gym time, our pampering time, our hobbies, our time out, our dreams are almost always \u201cadjustable\u201d and secondary to agenda\u2019s necessary for others or else we experience a feeling of guilt.\n\nSo basically if you focus on yourself you feel, or are made to feel, selfish and guilty and if you focus on others you feel internally upset for yourself. So much needs to be done, where do your priorities lie? We have all heard the story of a professor who took rocks, pebbles, gravel, sand and water and asked students what order was needed to fit it into the jar. He demonstrated that first the big ones go in, then the pebbles adjusted into cracks, gravel worked its way around and finally the sand followed by water.\n\nSimilarly in life, the big issues should get priority, followed by the not so important, followed by mundane, little things etc etc. However, what\u2019s important is what you prioritise as the big rocks in your life. Is your health for example one of them? And if so, why do you feel guilty about investing 1/24 hours on something so important? If you fall ill all the responsibilities which you shoulder go for a toss. If you think a health club is an expensive investment, ask for someone\u2019s hospital bill so you can compare it.\n\nDiwali is a great time for cleaning out the clutter. Clean your mental clutter by creating goals and focussing on identifying your rocks and what truly matters to you. It\u2019s not just you, but everyone else who will benefit from it.\n\nI had feelings for my childhood best friend and he ignored it completely then. But last year as my parents insisted I get married, I found a suitable match for myself. He is an office colleague and we are doing great now. A year after my marriage my best friend decides to confess his love for me. This thought is disturbing me.\n\nIf he loved you, he would not have rebuffed you or seen you waltz off with another man. You took a positive step forward, so keep it so. Never make someone a priority when all you were to them was an option.\n\nI\u2019m slightly attracted to one of my colleagues who is five years older than me. Recently he quit and since then, we\u2019ve been in touch through messages and occasional phone calls. We keep making plans to meet but he cancels it at the last moment. In our conversations, I can gauge that he\u2019s a little awkward and hesitant because of the age gap (I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal). While I have the urge to speak to him, I don\u2019t want to come across as desperate and do away with our friendship. How should I react?\n\nIt\u2019s highly unusual for a man to be intimidated by the fact a woman is 5 years younger. There\u2019s more to this than meets the eye and he\u2019s using it as an excuse. Anyone who makes a perfectly normal age gap an issue or cancels plans repeatedly is not worth investing into. It\u2019s just an attraction, let it fizzle.\n\nI\u2019m 18 and dating a guy from my college, though from a different stream. Our lecture timings are different, so when I am free, he\u2019s caught up with lectures and vice versa. I have always shared everything with my parents but obviously, this bit, I can\u2019t. While we make it a point to go out once in a while, he feels I do not give him enough time. On my part, my parents have started becoming suspicious of me since I stay out longer than usual. I\u2019m really confused. How should I go about this?\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for hiding anything from your parents unless they are hardcore conservative and will keep you housebound as a result of it. Parents matter, relationships matter, studies and a good future also greatly matter. At this age, you need to logically and clearly prioritize what will benefit your life long term and give it all the focus it deserves.", "description": "Life is such a jumble.
