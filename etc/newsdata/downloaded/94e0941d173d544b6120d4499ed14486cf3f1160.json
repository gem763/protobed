Manchester City's Ederson played in all 38 of his side's Premier League games last season, keeping 20 clean sheets and conceding 23 goals. Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen played in 35 of his team's La Liga fixtures last season, keeping 16 clean sheets and conceding 32 goals. Who do you think should be crowned Best Men's Goalkeeper? Claudio Ranieri led Leicester City to an unbelievable Premier League title win in 2016. Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid became the first side to retain the Champions League in 2017. Didier Deschamps delivered France's second World Cup in 2018. Those are the last three winners of Best Men's Coach. Tonight, it will be domestic treble winner Pep Guardiola, Champions League winner Jurgen Klopp, or Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino, who took his club to its first ever Champions League final. Just under an hour until the nominees start arriving... Advertisement A category we've not yet mentioned is Best Women's Goalkeeper. Here are the nominees! Christiane Endler \u2013 Paris Saint-Germain, Chile Hedvig Lindahl \u2013 Chelsea/Wolfsburg, Sweden Sari van Veenendaal \u2013 Arsenal/Atletico Madrid, Netherlands Best Men's Player nominee Cristiano Ronaldo has been ruled out of Juventus' match against Brescia tomorrow night due to injury, according to Sky Italy. As a Serie A player, he has less of a distance to travel to the ceremony in Milan tonight than most nominees... But will he be travelling at all? Lucy Bronze - up for Best Women's Player - is one of only two English nominees. The other is her national team manager, Phil Neville, who goes up against the USA's Jill Ellis and Sarina Wiegman of the Netherlands in the category of Best Women's Coach. (That is to say, 'best coach of a women's team', with Neville being the only male nominee of the three.) Just a reminder, nominees will start arriving at tonight's ceremony in Milan at around 6.30pm BST, with the proceedings officially getting underway at 7.30pm. Everything else you need to know can be found in our useful article here Advertisement Speaking of fan favourites, there's also the Fan Award! The nominees are... Silvia Grecco from Brazil; Uruguay's Justo Sanchez; and Netherlands fans at the Women\u2019s World Cup earlier this year. A real fan favourite each year is the Puskas Award for best goal. Mohamed Salah and Olivier Giroud were the last two winners, while this year's nominees are: injury-time overhead kick winner on his pro debut in Hungary this February. Lionel Messi for his impeccably precise chipped goal against Real Betis in March; Juan Fernando Quintero of River Plate for his ridiculous long-range free-kick against Racing Club in February; and 18-year-old Daniel Zsori for hiswinner on his pro debut in Hungary this February. Check them out above and make your own mind up as to which should win - they're all stunners. Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan - co-captains of this year's Women's World Cup-winning USA team - are up against one another tonight as they await the result of Best Women's Player. England's Lucy Bronze is the underdog in the category. Could she be a surprise winner? Advertisement Let's also take a look at last year's Men's World XI: Goalkeeper: David de Gea (Man United) Defence: Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Raphael Varane (Real Madrid), Marcelo (Real Madrid), Dani Alves (PSG) Midfield: Eden Hazard (Chelsea), N'Golo Kante (Chelsea), Luka Modric (Real Madrid) Attack: Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Kylian Mbappe (PSG), Cristiano Ronaldo (Real Madrid/Juventus) Our writers picked their World XI for this year, and you can check it out here As for Best Men's Goalkeeper... It's not guaranteed that a Premier League keeper will win, but Liverpool's Alisson and Man City's Ederson have Barcelona's Marc-Andre ter Stegen outnumbered. Who do you think deserves the prize? A Premier League manager is guaranteed to win the Best Men's Coach award, with the nominees being Manchester City's Pep Guardiola, Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp and Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino. Guardiola led City to a historic domestic treble last season, Klopp guided the Reds to their first Champions League crown in 14 years and Pochettino's Spurs were runners-up to Liverpool in that European final. Real Madrid's Luka Modric was crowned Best Men's Player last year, while Brazil's Marta won the Best Women's Player trophy. Advertisement Who do you think will take home the prize of Best Men's Player? Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk is favourite, and would be the first Premier League player to win the award since 2008. The winner that year? Cristiano Ronaldo - then of Manchester United - who is up for the award again tonight, representing Juventus. Follow live coverage of the 2019 Best Fifa Football Awards tonight.
