ICE arrested Ulises Perez later on Wednesday, the agency said in a statement.\n\nICE filed a detainer request with the Oklahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office on Tuesday, before Ulises Perez was released, asking that he be transferred to immigration authorities, but the Sheriff\u2019s Office refused to honor it \u201cin direct contravention of federal immigration law,\u201d ICE said in a statement.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this is not an isolated event,\u201d the statement said. \u201cA few months ago, Oklahoma County decided to no longer honor ICE detainers and began releasing criminal aliens back into the local community at the expense of law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that someone who is sworn to uphold the law would find it acceptable to release an alleged rapist who is illegally present in the U.S. back into the community when there are other options available under federal immigration law,\u201d read a statement from Marc Moore, the field-office director for ICE Dallas. \u201cWithin a few hours of being released, this illegal alien was back at the home of the rape victim where he was free to re-victimize her and harm other members of the community.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortunately, ICE deportation officers were able to quickly locate this individual and safely take him back into custody,\u201d Moore said.", "description": "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Thursday that agents arrested an undocumented Salvadoran migrant accused of going to a woman's house and raping her immediately after he was released from custody by the Oklahoma County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which failed to honor an ICE detainer.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Jim Geraghty", "John Mccormack", "A.
