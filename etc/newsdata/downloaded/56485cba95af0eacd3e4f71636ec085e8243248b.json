However, the hotels in the area are heavily guarded by the military and are unlikely to have been attacked.\n\nIt was not clear who the attackers were or where they came from but Rwanda has in the past seen incursions by fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) armed group from their bases in eastern DRC.\n\nThe FDLR is composed of former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu rebels who fled after taking part in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\n\nOver the years, various groups opposed to Rwanda have found sanctuary in DRC's eastern jungles from where they have occasionally launched attacks on the country.", "description": "Attack occurred in Musanze district, a popular area for tourists visiting Volcanoes Park to view mountain gorillas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/5/7b81f2b1d4344185bf5087a81ea97013_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
