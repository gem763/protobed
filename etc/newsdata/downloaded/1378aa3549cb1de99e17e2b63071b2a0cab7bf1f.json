It became too difficult but they never stopped fighting,\" he added.\n\nEarly quarter-final qualification is redemption for England after the humiliation of four years ago when they were the first World Cup hosts to miss out on the knock-out stages.\n\nNext for Jones is a potential winner-takes-all meeting with arch-rivals France in Yokohama on October 12 to top Pool C - this World Cup's 'group of death'.\n\nArgentina's hopes of qualifying hang by a thread. They must beat the United States on Wednesday and hope France lose their two remaining fixtures against Tonga and England.\n\nScorers:\n\nEngland\n\nTries: Elliot Daly, Jonny May, Ben Youngs, George Ford, Jack Nowell, Luke Cowan-Dickie\n\n\n\nConversions: Owen Farrell (3)\n\n\n\nPenalty: Farrell\n\nArgentina\n\nTry: Matias Moroni\n\nConversion: Emiliano Boffelli\n\n\n\nPenalty: Benjamin Urdapilleta\n\nTeams:\n\nArgentina\n\n15 Emiliano Boffelli, 14 Matias Moroni, 13 Matias Orlando, 12 Jeronimo De La Fuente, 11 Santiago Carreras, 10 Benjamin Urdapilleta, 9 Tomas Cubelli, 8 Javier Ortega Desio, 7 Marcos Kremer, 6 Pablo Matera (captain), 5 Tomas Lavanini, 4 Guido Petti, 3 Juan Figallo, 2 Julian Montoya, 1 Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Agustin Creevy, 17 Mayco Vivas, 18 Santiago Medrano, 19 Matias Alemanno, 20 Tomas Lezana, 21 Felipe Ezcurra, 22 Lucas Mensa, 23 Bautista Delguy\n\nEngland\n\n15 Elliot Daly, 14 Anthony Watson, 13 Manu Tuilagi, 12 Owen Farrell (captain), 11 Jonny May, 10 George Ford, 9 Ben Youngs, 8 Billy Vunipola, 7 Sam Underhill, 6 Tom Curry, 5 George Kruis, 4 Maro Itoje, 3 Kyle Sinckler, 2 Jamie George, 1 Joe Marler\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17 Mako Vunipola, 18 Dan Cole, 19 Courtney Lawes, 20 Lewis Ludlam, 21 Willi Heinz, 22 Henry Slade, 23 Jack Nowell", "description": "England put in a frustrating performance in subduing a 14-man Argentina side in their Pool C Rugby World Cup clash in Tokyo.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7884/ea2d036e5d414f44ac8bf48e3f3838ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
