Rand Paul (R-KY) addressed the report that federal prosecutors are examining Rudy Giuliani\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine amid calls to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings there.\n\nPaul voiced his support for investigating Giuliani\u2019s dealings as long as Hunter Biden was also investigated.\n\n\u201cI would say when you look at the Ukraine situation and you look at the accusations of the president somehow being involved with withholding aide, I think the one that\u2019s true in Washington is that everybody seems to be trying to tell Ukraine what to do,\u201d Paul stated. \u201cWe had three senators that said if they didn\u2019t investigate Trump they would who would vote to withhold their aid. We had a Democrat senator just a month ago fly over to Ukraine and say if they investigated Hunter Biden he would vote to withhold their aid. So, I think both parties have been doing this.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf we want to investigate Rudy Giuliani\u2019s financial dealings, by all means, do it, but at the same time \u2026 if we want to be fair, we should investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine as well.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During a Tuesday interview on \"MSNBC Live,\" Sen.
