A bearded man is seen dancing, wading in and out of the crowd with fish-like motions.\n\nThe \"Baby Shark\" song has been popularised by a video uploaded to YouTube by a South Korean children's educational company called Pinkfong in 2016. It has become one of the most-watched videos on the platform, with over 3.7 billion views.", "description": "A popular children's song became a rallying cry in Lebanon after protesters in Beirut spontaneously sang the hit to calm a toddler caught in the midst of a noisy demonstration.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Charlotte Runcie", "Jan Etherington", "Philip Johnston", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/Yu-gan2pbuY/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
