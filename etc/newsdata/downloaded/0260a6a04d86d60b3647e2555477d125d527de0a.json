There\u2019s no evidence that he thinks deeply about anything. Which is why I was not shocked when he condemned the House impeachment inquiry as a \u201clynching\u201d earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the president, without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2014 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nSign up for the Morning Briefing Newsletter.\n\nMore than 4,000 African-American men, women and children were lynched \u2014 burned, beaten, drowned, shot or hanged to death \u2014 between 1877 and 1950. Trump almost certainly doesn\u2019t know this. To a president who operates as an internet troll as much as a head of state, \u201clynching\u201d is just another provocation \u2014 another way to seize the national conversation in the face of bad news and criticism. And to a man who can\u2019t see beyond his own ego, \u201clynching\u201d must feel like an apt analogy for the scrutiny of his political opponents. He can\u2019t imagine anything worse.\n\nTrump\u2019s behavior didn\u2019t shock me. What did shock me was a comment from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. When asked about the president\u2019s \u201clynching\u201d remark, Graham said the comparison was apt: \u201cYes, this is a lynching and in every sense this is un-American. I\u2019ve never seen a situation in my lifetime as a lawyer where someone is accused of a major misconduct and cannot confront the accuser or call witnesses on their behalf.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Equal Justice Initiative The lynchings in Pickens County, S.C., recorded on a monument at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala.\n\nTrump is ignorant; Graham is not. In 2005, during Graham\u2019s first Senate term, a unanimous Senate passed a resolution apologizing to lynching victims and their descendants for the chamber\u2019s failure to enact anti-lynching legislation. It expressed \u201cthe deepest sympathies and most solemn regrets of the Senate to the descendants of the victims of lynching, the ancestors of whom were deprived of life, human dignity, and the constitutional protections accorded all citizens of the United States.\u201d It also called on the Senate to \u201cremember the history of lynching, to ensure that these tragedies will neither be forgotten nor repeated.\u201d\n\n[Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet.

The vote, again, was unanimous. and Graham, again, was there. But even if he hadn\u2019t been \u2014 and even if these votes had never happened \u2014 Graham should still know better. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on criminal and racial justice, 185 black Americans were reported lynched in South Carolina.\n\nGraham is a native of Central, a small town in Pickens County at the northwest edge of the state. At least four of the 185 lynchings took place in the area. In 1947, eight years before Graham was born, a 24-year-old black man named Willie Earle was taken from jail \u2014 where he was held on charges of assault \u2014 and killed by a mob of white men, the last racially motivated lynching to take place in the state. A generation earlier, in 1912, a black teenager named Brooks Gordon was lynched for allegedly shooting at a white woman while she drew water from a spring. Twenty-two years before that, in 1890, Henry Johnson was killed after he was accused of rape. Another black man accused of assault \u2014 his name is lost to history \u2014 was lynched in 1891.\n\nNo, Graham did not live through this era. But his parents did, and the violence of that period marks the place he calls home. It marks the entire region and state. As a lawmaker who represents that state \u2014 who represents families and communities upended by racial terrorism past and present \u2014 Graham has a particular responsibility to that history. He owes his constituents a degree of sensitivity, an awareness of the weight of a word like \u201clynching.\u201d\n\nGraham has rejected those obligations. Instead, he\u2019s content to affirm President Trump\u2019s endless sense of his own victimhood. On Thursday, Graham introduced a resolution in the Senate to condemn the impeachment inquiry in the House. He will say anything to defend the president, even if it means minimizing one of the worst crimes this nation has perpetrated on its own citizens. Graham hasn\u2019t just embraced the president, he\u2019s embraced Trump\u2019s total shamelessness \u2014 his absolute failure to hold himself accountable to any worthwhile standard of character.\n\nThe day before Trump and Graham made their comments, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission in Mississippi erected its fourth sign marking the spot on the Tallahatchie River where, in the summer of 1955, Till\u2019s body was found after he was kidnapped, tortured and lynched. The three previous signs had been either stolen or vandalized and two were riddled with bullets in displays of anger and contempt. The new sign is made of steel.\n\nThe reason to condemn Trump and Graham for their \u201clynching\u201d remarks is not to score a partisan point or because it will make a difference in their language or behavior. It\u2019s because we haven\u2019t actually resolved the trauma of the past. Historical spaces are still contested. The scars are still present.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We\u2019d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.
