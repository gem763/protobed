A spokesman declined to comment on whether there would be job losses.\n\n--- In the water business, revenue was flat over the nine months, while volumes dropped 2.2%.\n\n--- The head of Nestl\u00e9 Waters, Maurizio Patarnello, will leave the company by the end of the year.\n\n--- The change mimics a restructuring in the infant nutrition arm where the company says results have improved.\n\n--- Sales in the nine months ended Sept. 30 were 68.37bn Swiss francs, up from 66.42bn francs year-on-year.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nWater is a \"problem category\" for Nestl\u00e9, said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo earlier this month, saying the business is losing share to rivals in the US, its biggest market. The company backed its 2019 estimates and said it would return 20bn francs to investors over the next few years, primarily through share buybacks. It didn't release profit figures.\n\nSince taking over in 2017, CEO Mark Schneider has tried to focus energies on a handful of core businesses he views as high-growth. Water is one of these, along with nutrition, pet food and coffee.Meanwhile, the company has faced scrutiny from activist investor Daniel Loeb to improve its financial performance and sell its stake in L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nWSJ City: The news, the key facts and why it matters.
