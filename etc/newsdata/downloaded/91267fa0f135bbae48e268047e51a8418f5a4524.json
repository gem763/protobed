Now, it threatens one of the world\u2019s most densely populated cities, with rivers in and around Tokyo already close to bursting.\n\nAD\n\nNerves were set on edge in the capital as residents\u2019 mobile phones issued a series of siren-style alerts on Saturday afternoon warning of steadily rising risks of flooding and mudslides.\n\nAD\n\nJMA had warned the previous day that Hagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, could be as severe as a 1958 typhoon that killed more than 1,200 people in Tokyo and elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe storm weakened slightly as it approached Japan on Saturday but winds still reached 100 mph at its center by 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), with gusts up to 136 mph, making it the equivalent of a Level 2 hurricane on the U.S. Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale.\n\nAD\n\nIt is already bringing strong winds and record-breaking rains to parts of Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu.\n\nThe JMA moved to a Level 5 warning for heavy rainfall on Saturday afternoon for parts of central and eastern Japan, implying that floods and landslides may already have occurred, and warning people to \u201ctake measures to protect lives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPeople who had left it too late to move to shelters were advised to relocate to a higher floor or find a nearby strong building, as the JMA predicted rainfall \u201cwith a level of intensity observed only once every few decades.\u201d\n\nA man in his fifties was killed when his car overturned in high winds in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo on Saturday morning, local officials told the Kyodo News service, while a man was missing and presumed drowned in a river in Shizuoka prefecture, according to public broadcaster NHK.\n\nAD\n\nAt least 11 people were injured in Chiba and elsewhere in the country, after the wind blew the roofs off several houses and caused other damage.\n\nPublic transport was severely disrupted on Saturday afternoon in and around the capital, with all flights to and from Tokyo\u2019s Narita and Haneda airports canceled, and many subway services and most trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area suspended.\n\nAD\n\nShinkansen bullet trains stopped running between Tokyo and the cities of Nagoya and services were disrupted all the way to Osaka and Okayama in eastern Japan.\n\nShops in and around Tokyo either remained closed on Saturday or shut their doors at noon so staff could get home to beat the approaching storm. Residents had emptied the shelves of some supermarkets the previous day as people hunkered down.\n\nAD\n\nNHK said the government had ordered 262,000 people in eight prefectures in eastern and central Japan to evacuate their homes, while more than 5 million had been issued less strict evacuation \u201cadvisories.\u201d\n\nAt least 24,000 were reported to have lost power, with the prefecture of Chiba worst affected. Chiba, which lies to the south and east of Tokyo, was still struggling to get back on its feet after another typhoon struck it in September, causing extensive damage and massive blackouts.\n\nThe Disneyland and DisneySea theme parks in Tokyo were also closed on Saturday.\n\nAD", "description": "Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency issued its highest level of emergency rainfall warnings for Tokyo and nearby regions as the storm approached.", "authors": ["Simon Denyer", "Tokyo Bureau Chief Covering Japan", "North Korea", "South Korea.", "Akiko Kashiwagi"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SAIH9TzeK48fAHHHvvJXv3A83Lg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FNFBUZXM2II6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
