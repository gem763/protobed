With our excellent performance year-to-date, we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 financial guidance.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on the successful execution of the palovarotene program to bring the first therapeutic treatment to FOP patients as expeditiously as possible. We also continue to deliver on our external innovation strategy. The recent in-licensing of BLU-782 reinforces our leadership in FOP with a different and potentially complementary mechanism of action to palovarotene, expands our portfolio approach in this complex ultra-rare bone disorder and leverages our clinical and commercial capabilities. Advancing our pipeline remains a key focus going forward to deliver on our growth strategy and to bring additional value to patients and shareholders.\u201d\n\nThird quarter 2019 sales highlights\n\nNote: Unless stated otherwise, all variations in sales are stated excluding foreign exchange impacts (currency effects established by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the exchange rates from the previous period)\n\n(in million euros) 2019 2018 % Variation % Variation at constant currency and consolidation scope21 Specialty Care 574.2 484.1 18.6% 16.5% Somatuline\u00ae 264.0 217.0 21.7% 18.8% Decapeptyl\u00ae 98.9 89.2 10.9% 10.5% Cabometyx\u00ae 64.5 38.8 66.5% 66.3% Onivyde\u00ae 26.1 26.9 -3.0% -7.3% Dysport\u00ae 97.4 87.7 11.0% 8.8% Consumer Healthcare 70.6 71.9 -1.8% 0.1% Smecta\u00ae 34.1 32.8 4.1% 2.5% Forlax\u00ae 10.5 9.5 10.6% 9.7% Tanakan\u00ae 8.8 9.6 -8.8% -10.0% Group sales 644.7 555.9 16.0% 14.5%\n\nQ3 2019 Group sales grew 14.5%1 to \u20ac644.7 million.\n\nSales of Specialty Care products reached \u20ac574.2 million, up 16.5% year-on-year.\n\nSomatuline sales reached \u20ac264.0 million, up 18.8%, year-on-year, driven by 20.0% growth in North America, double-digit growth in key European countries and good performance in Japan.\n\nDecapeptyl sales reached \u20ac98.9 million, up 10.5% year-on-year, driven by volume and market share gains in Europe and double-digit growth in China.\n\nCabometyx sales reached \u20ac64.5 million, growing 66.3% year-on-year, driven by the good performance in all launched European countries and additional launches in Asia and Oceania.\n\nOnivyde sales reached \u20ac26.1 million, down 7.3% year-on-year, impacted by limited shipments to Ipsen\u2019s ex-U.S. partner in the third quarter.\n\nDysport sales reached \u20ac97.4 million, up 8.8% year-on-year, driven by the solid performance in the U.S. in the therapeutics and aesthetics markets, as well as growth from Galderma in Europe.\n\nConsumer Healthcare product sales totaled \u20ac70.6 million, stable at +0.1%1, driven by Smecta growth of 2.5% year-on-year, from the good performance in France and in China despite the new hospital competitive pricing environment, and Forlax growth of 9.7% year-on-year.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties t hat may cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect the Group\u2019s future ability to achieve its financial targets, which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d and \u201cexpects\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, including the Group\u2019s expectations regarding future events, including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover, the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions, which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by the Group. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future, and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties, notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets, notably for regulatory or competition reasons. The Group must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore, the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that the Group may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore, the Group cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during pre-clinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials, or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the Group\u2019s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions. The Group also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to the Group\u2019s activities and financial results. The Group cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of the Group\u2019s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on the Group\u2019s business, financial position or performance. The Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements, targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events, conditions, assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based, unless so required by applicable law. The Group\u2019s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to the Group\u2019s 2018 Registration Document available on its website (www.ipsen.com).\n\nComparison of Consolidated Sales for the Third Quarter and First nine months of 2019 and 2018:\n\nAll variations in sales are stated excluding foreign exchange impacts, established by recalculating net sales for the relevant period at the rates from the previous period.\n\nSubsidiaries involved in the partnership between Ipsen and Schwabe Group are consolidated in accordance with the equity method starting 1 January, 2019.
