It lacks the resources, the ideology, and the appeal of its predecessor,\" said Paul Stronski, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAt the same time Russia should not be dismissed as a minor player, Stronski, a former US State Department analyst, said in a report this month.\n\n\"Moscow boasts an agile and skilled diplomatic establishment and lacks ethical constraints in pursuit of its objectives.\"", "description": "President Vladimir Putin opens Russia's first ever summit with dozens of African leaders on Wednesday as Moscow seeks to vie for influence on the continent...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/09/wire-19982238-1571647378-173_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
