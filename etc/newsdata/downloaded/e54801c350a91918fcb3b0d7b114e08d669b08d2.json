I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn't go against each other. And they did.\"\n\nImage copyright Red Sky Shepherds Huts via PA Media Image caption The former PM famously wrote his memoirs in a shed - which allegedly cost \u00a325,000\n\nMr Cameron said the Leave side had a \"very powerful emotional argument\", while Remain had the \"very strong technical and economic arguments\", and the former - plus the issue of immigration - was a \"winning combination\" for his rivals.\n\n\"It turned into this terrible Tory psychodrama and I couldn't seem to get through,\" he said.\n\n\"What Boris and Michael Gove were doing was more exciting than the issues I was trying to get across. I felt like I was in a sort of quagmire by the end.\"\n\nBut he still defended his decision to call the referendum, saying the issue of the EU \"needed to be addressed\".\n\nHe said: \"Every single day I think about it, the referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done differently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next.\n\n\"I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it's painful for the country and it's painful to watch.\"\n\nImage caption David Cameron and his wife Samantha after he became PM in 2010\n\nSpeaking about the current prime minister's strategy, Mr Cameron said he \"wants him to succeed\", but his plan has \"morphed into something quite different\".\n\nHe said: \"Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded.\n\n\"I didn't support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea.\"\n\nMr Cameron also spoke of the damage to his friendships - including the one between him and Mr Gove, who had been close friends since university.\n\n\"We've spoken,\" he said. \"Not a huge amount. I've sort of had a conversation with him.\n\n\"I've spoken to the prime minister a little bit, mainly through texts, but Michael was a very good friend. So that has been more difficult.\"\n\nBut he did praise his immediate successor Theresa May - who had been his home secretary throughout his time at No 10 - for her \"phenomenal\" work rate and her \"ethos of public service\", even if he was not unquestioning of her strategy.\n\nImage copyright PA Media Image caption David Cameron with Theresa May, when she was his home secretary\n\n\"I remember frequently texting [Mrs May] about the frustration of getting a Brexit deal and then seeing Brexiteers vote it down possibly at the risk of the whole project they had devoted themselves to,\" said Mr Cameron. \"Maddening and infuriating\n\n\"There's an argument that Brexit is just impossible to deliver and no one could have done, and there's an argument that, well, wrong choices were made. This is somewhere in between.\"\n\nAsked what happens next, Mr Cameron said he did not think a no-deal Brexit \"should be pursued\". He also did not reject a further referendum.\n\n\"I don't think you can rule it out because we're stuck,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not saying one will happen or should happen. I'm just saying that you can't rule things out right now because you've got to find some way of unblocking the blockage.\"\n\nDavid Cameron as PM\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMr Cameron became the Conservative Party leader in 2005. Five years later he was voted into Downing Street as the UK's youngest prime minister in almost 200 years - aged 43.\n\nHis six-year tenure - firstly in coalition with the Liberal Democrats and latterly with a majority government - was dominated by his desire to reduce the deficit, and the introduction of austerity measures with his Chancellor George Osborne.\n\nBut when he pledged in his party's 2015 manifesto to hold a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, the focus shifted.\n\nMr Cameron backed Remain during the 2016 campaign and, on the morning of the result after discovering he had lost, he announced he would be stepping down, saying: \"I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination.\"\n\nThe former PM has remained silent until now about both of his successors at the helm of the Tory Party - Theresa May and Boris Johnson.\n\nBut his allegedly fractious relationship with Mr Johnson has been well documented since their days together at Oxford University - most notably as members of the infamous Bullingdon Club.", "description": "The former prime minister says the 2016 EU referendum turned into a \"terrible Tory psychodrama\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B752/production/_108803964_1d361ffc-be5c-4016-93b9-26e6018045fe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
