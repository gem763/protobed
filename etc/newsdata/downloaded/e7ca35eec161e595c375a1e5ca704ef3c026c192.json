I met and heard from thousands of people who followed my father\u2019s commentary, and it was one question \u2014 above all others \u2014 that so many dearly wished they could know the answer to: \u201cWhat would Charles say about this?\u201d My father\u2019s voice is missed, now more than ever.\n\nIn his public life, my father played a very special role. He was not just another talking head. He was a trusted guide to so many who read his columns and watched his commentary on television. As one colleague described it: \u201cI often found myself hoping Charles would ... write about some particular issue I was struggling with so that I\u2019d know what to think about it.\u201d The refrain I heard over and over again from his admirers was \u201cI feel lost without him.\u201d\n\nOn a deeply personal level, I know that feeling more intensely than anyone. But it was both moving and enlightening for me to learn that so many others feel similarly lost, adrift in a world that has become even less navigable in the time since he has gone, even less clear in its truths and falsehoods. Our politics have become more brutal, our discourse is more shrill and uncharitable.\n\nCAL THOMAS: A TRIBUTE TO CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER\n\nAgainst this, my father represented something very different: an exemplar of a better kind of politics and a higher mode of discourse. That is why so many people \u2014 whether they agreed with his conclusions or not \u2014 relied on him to help them work out their own thoughts on what was happening in the world. They trusted him. He earned and retained that trust, I believe, by embodying several crucial tenets of free and open debate.\n\nFirst, he was truthful. He said what he believed. He did not pull punches, alter his stance or mouth party tropes to please anyone or to mirror public opinion. There was a consistency to his positions. He wouldn\u2019t shift them to follow changing trends. And it is remarkable to see \u2014 as perfectly illustrated in his book \u2014 how unswerving his reasoning remained on so many issues over the span of nearly four decades.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSecond, my father was logical. He would show you exactly why and how he came to his conclusions, walking you through every step of reasoning and evidence to his closing point. He was determined to make the very best argument he could for the positions he thought were right, and to address the most compelling objections and counter-arguments that he found on the opposing side.\n\nThis intellectual rigor raised the quality of debate for everyone who engaged with his arguments. It helped guide others on not just what to think but how to think about important questions. Those who agreed with him better understood why they did. Those who disagreed would see a strong counterargument that forced them to defend and appreciate their own positions better. And those in between could see exactly which principles or assumptions or empirical evidence they found convincing, and which not.\n\nThird, my father\u2019s goal was to persuade. This may seem obvious, but it is not. Many in politics seek only to rally those who already agree with them, to discredit their opponents or simply to intimidate and overpower the other side. Leading others to change their mind of their own free will is no easy task.\n\nIn the end, the success and survival of democracy depend on choosing persuasion over brute force. My father did the hard work of democracy. He didn\u2019t take the shortcuts. And that is the kind of commitment that democracy requires of its leaders and its citizens. It requires a democratic spirit. And it requires personal virtue. The founding fathers recognized this. \u201cPublic virtue cannot exist in a nation without private, and public virtue is the only foundation of republics,\u201d wrote John Adams. And as Benjamin Franklin is reputed to have said after the Constitutional Convention, the American people had \u201ca republic, if you can keep it.\u201d Only republican virtue could keep this democratic republic alive.\n\nMy father was a man of such virtues. And his public greatness was inextricably linked with his personal goodness \u2014 as so many who knew him and witnessed his impact on our country have observed. The most important things about my father\u2019s life were not political, and they were not public. I feel that as deeply as any truth I know. But he did not trumpet his personal virtues, or his personal life, in any significant way. His vocation \u2014 his calling \u2014 was in politics and the service he gave to our democracy. And he would want his memory to be based therein.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI believe we owe it to him, and to ourselves, to appreciate how fundamentally his democratic spirit derived from his humane soul. His belief in human liberty, in freedom of conscience and thought and in democratic pluralism was absolutely core to his being. But he could never have been such a strong, resonant and dearly missed voice in our politics if not for his honesty, his decency, his magnanimity, his bravery and his humanity.\n\nIt was put best, perhaps, by his friends and colleagues, who wrote: \u201cHe was ... a giant, a man who not only defended our civilization but represented what\u2019s best in it.\u201d May we all take inspiration from his example.\n\nAdapted from the preface to the paperback edition of Charles Krauthammer\u2019s posthumous book, \"The Point of It All\" (Crown Forum).
