Its numerous business divisions span across the discovery, extraction, refining and retail sale of oil and natural gas.\n\nExxon Mobil is also one of the world\u2019s largest chemical manufacturers, making products like synthetic rubbers, industrial alcohols and solvents.\n\nThe company employs about 71,000 people.\n\nFinances\n\nExxon Mobil\u2019s market cap peaked at $527.2 billion on Oct. 18, 2007.\n\nToday, the company is ranked in the No. 2 position on the Fortune 500 list, with $290 billion in revenue last year.\n\nExxon Mobil has been investing in Texas\u2019 Permian Basin.

He worked in a variety of assignments with the company before being appointed vice president of ExxonMobil Chemical Company in 2005. In 2008, he became ExxonMobil Refining and Supply Company\u2019s director of refining for Europe, Africa and the Middle East. He became the company\u2019s vice president of supply and transportation in 2010. He became president of Exxon Mobil in 2016 and took over as CEO in 2017 after Rex Tillerson left to become secretary of state in President Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nThe company also has a 10-member board of directors. It includes CEOs of companies like Merck and MetLife, as well as former CEOs of Johnson & Johnson, PepsiCo, IBM and Caterpillar.\n\nHistory\n\nIndustrialist John D. Rockefeller started Standard Oil Company in 1870. The business focused on kerosene in its early years.\n\nIn 1911, an anti-trust ruling broke up Standard Oil into 34 companies, including what would eventually become Mobil and Exxon \u2014 in 1966 and 1972, respectively.\n\nAs competitors, the companies spent decades growing, acquiring other businesses, improving techniques and developing new synthetics.\n\nExxon made headlines around the world in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground in the Prince William Sound in Alaska. The equivalent of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil spilled into the water. The cleanup took years and cost billions of dollars, and the company says it has made changes to prevent a similar accident from happening.\n\nMobil and Exxon merged 10 years later, in what was then the largest corporate merger ever. The combined Exxon Mobil became the largest oil company and one of the overall largest businesses in the world.\n\nAs of 2008, there were about 12,000 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the U.S., but most were owned by branded distributors. The company said it would sell its remaining stations over several years.\n\nHot issues\n\nExxon Mobil announced in 2018 that it would invest $50 billion over five years to expand its business in the U.S. The company said it will create thousands of jobs as it expands existing operations and adds new infrastructure and manufacturing in areas like Texas and New Mexico.\n\nIn its last quarterly earnings report, Exxon Mobil said it was also preparing to start a new project in Guyana. The company estimates the development will yield more than 6 billion barrels of oil.\n\nIn an \u201cOutlook for Energy\u201d report Exxon Mobil published earlier in 2019, the company said it expects climate change and increasing demand in developing parts of the world will help wind and solar energy grow significantly, but they will still account for the smallest portion of overall energy sources\n\nTraditional energy sources like oil and natural gas will \u201cremain important energy sources and require significant investment,\u201d Exxon Mobil wrote in the report. Natural gas will grow the most, and oil will continue as the world\u2019s top energy source thanks to commercial transportation and the chemicals industry, together accounting for more than half of global energy, the company predicted.\n\nStill, the company is embracing change in the industry. Exxon Mobil recently announced a partnership to work on technology it said can remove carbon dioxide from emissions sources. The company has also pledged to invest as much as $100 million on lower-emissions research and development with the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory and National Energy Technology Laboratory.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Exxon Mobil has a long history dating back to the early days of American oil prospecting and kerosene production.", "authors": ["James Leggate"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/03/0/0/AP19064550380436.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
