We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,\u201d Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank.\n\nHe also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.\n\nPence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike (NKE.N) and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China\u2019s Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong.\n\nThe vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration\u2019s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d he said.\n\nBy \u201csiding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\u201d Pence said.\n\nNike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\u201d he said.\n\nPence said \u201cfar too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China\u2019s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.\u201d\n\nNike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks.\n\nInfluential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still \u201croom for optimism.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe emphasized the U.S. does not want to \u2018decouple\u2019 and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,\u201d it said.\n\nTRADE TALKS\n\nThe closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\n\nThe S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments.\n\nAnalysts said Pence\u2019s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump\u2019s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election.\n\nDouglas Paal, a China expert with Washington\u2019s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it \u201ca superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.\u201d\n\nScott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for \u201cpolicy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.\u201d\n\nA new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday.\n\nThe United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors.\n\nFears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence\u2019s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence attends a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir/Files\n\nMany China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well.\n\n\u201cIn contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President\u2019s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,\u201d said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China.\n\nPence said the United States was \u201cnot seeking to contain China\u2019s development.\u201d \u201cWe want a constructive relationship with China\u2019s leaders,\u201d he said, calling on Beijing to \u201cseize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday accused China of curtailing \"rights and liberties\" in Hong Kong and blasted U.S. company Nike and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444709833&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O04Z", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
