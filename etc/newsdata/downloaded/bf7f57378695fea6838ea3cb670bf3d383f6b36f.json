On Thursday, the \u201cJesus Walks\u201d emcee opened up to Zane Lowe on Apple Music\u2019s Beats 1 about his newfound faith and the hold it now has on his life.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m in service to Christ, my job is to spread the gospel, to let people know what Jesus has done for me,\u201d West began in the preview clip. \u201cI\u2019ve spread a lot of things. There was a time I was letting you know what high fashion had done for me, I was letting you know what the Hennessey had done for me, but now I\u2019m letting you know what Jesus has done for me, and in that I\u2019m no longer a slave, I\u2019m a son now, a son of God. I\u2019m free.\u201d\n\nWHO IS KANYE WEST'S CALIFORNIA PASTOR PREACHING AT SUNDAY SERVICE?\n\nWest went on to explain to the radio host that he used his 2016 hospitalization -- where he was reportedly treated for temporary psychosis and sleep deprivation -- as a means of pulling himself out of the funk he was in.\n\n\u201cThe most space that I had to think is when I went to the hospital,\u201d said West. \u201cOne of the things that happened when I went to the hospital is I started reading the Bible and I started writing and copying out Bible verses and a person came to my house that wasn\u2019t a Christian and told me come over, and 30 minutes later I was in handcuffs headed to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe father-of-four said that he thinks had it not been for this unnamed individual paying him a visit, he might not be alive today.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST BUY $14M PROPERTY IN WYOMING\n\n\u201cNow this person very well may have saved my life because when you\u2019re in an episode you could jump off the side of a balcony you can stab your eye out you can do a lot of things when you\u2019re ramped up like that, but one of the things that people do now is they try to discriminate against my mind and my thoughts because of that moment,\u201d he added.\n\nIn January, West began leading Sunday Service, a gospel-rap group that performs every Sunday in various locations. From Wyoming to Georgia, West, alongside a group of musicians, partake in worship of Jesus through gospel music.\n\nWest acts as a preacher throughout the performances.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KIDS GET BAPTIZED IN ARMENIA AS KANYE WEST SAYS HE WAS BORN AGAIN\n\n\"I've seen him work miracles in my life,\" West proclaimed in a September Sunday Service event in Georgia.\n\nWest had spent ample time in Wyoming over the course of the last three years where he worked on his entire \u201cYe\u201d album and held the listening party on-site, which was reminiscent of a large bonfire pep rally. It was also three years ago that West revealed he was $53 million in debt while asking Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for a $1 billion investment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWest has since turned his fortunes around, with Forbes ranking the rapper as the third highest-paid celebrity in July, noting he built a $1 billion empire through his brand Yeezy.\n\n\u201cJesus Is King\u201d is slated to be released on Friday, Oct. 25.\n\nFox News' Andy Sahadeo contributed to this report.", "description": "Kanye West is a changed man.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Kanye-West.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
