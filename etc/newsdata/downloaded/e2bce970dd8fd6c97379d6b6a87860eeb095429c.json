You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNow Downing Street has retreated, saying only Brexit legislation will be halted, while bills for the prime minister\u2019s \u201cdomestic priorities\u201d will go ahead.\n\nMr Johnson, speaking on a visit to a hospital, made clear there would be no strike and that he would pursue his wider agenda.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be governing in the interests of the country. We are going to be continuing with our dynamic One Nation Conservative agenda,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\u201cWhat we won't do is engage in pointless Brexitology in parliament when parliament is simply committed to delay.\u201d\n\nLittle more than 12 hours earlier, a Downing Street spokesman had told journalists only the \u201cbare minimum\u201d would be done, adding: \u201cWe will pursue a general election every day and do everything we can to get it.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the \u201cstrike\u201d being called off, the Treasury made clear the Budget announced for 6 November has been scrapped.\n\nThe prime minister is leaving open the option of pulling Monday\u2019s vote, to overturn the fixed term parliaments act for a 12 December election, if the EU has not made its decision on an Article 50 extension.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

unacceptable.\n\nHelen Goodman, a shadow minister, was among Labour MPs who questioned why Mr Johnson did not simply agree a timetable to bring back the withdrawal agreement bill, saying: \u201cThis is beyond childish.\u201d\n\nAnother, Jess Phillips, protested: \u201cThink of the progress that could be made on rights, security, safety and future of our country.\n\n\u201cThink of that unique chance to change things. Imagine not bothering because you didn't get your way.\u201d\n\nIt now appears certain Labour will scupper the election on Monday, after Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, suggested \u201cfurther legislation\u201d was needed to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nMr Johnson\u2019s spokesman insisted it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for Mr Johnson to change the election date \u2013 to beyond the expected new 31 January deadline \u2013 after parliament had been dissolved.\n\n\u201cParliament dissolves 25 working days before the date of the election. At the moment of dissolution, the date of the election is locked,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged a date change was possible in the few days between a vote to trigger an election and dissolution \u2013 but predicted MPs would seize control of the Commons to prevent that anyway.", "description": "Boris Johnson has dropped plans for the government to go \"on strike\" if he fails to trigger a pre-Christmas general election, after the move was widely ridiculed.
