I had no idea.\n\n\"I was like, 'I can't be the only person to have a baby in the middle of the postseason.' And for it to blow up like it did, man, it's kind of crazy. But I didn't really give much thought about not going. My family is top priority for me.\"\n\nHudson's decision to be with his family reignited a debate centered around parenthood in sports, where athletes draw criticism from some fans and commentators who believe loyalty to the team should always come first.\n\nUnreal that Daniel Hudson is on paternity list and missing game 1 of #NLCS . Only excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother. If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter? #waittosee \u2014 David P. Samson (@DavidPSamson) October 11, 2019\n\n\"Unreal that Daniel Hudson is on paternity list and missing game 1 of #NLCS,\" former Miami Marlins president David Samson tweeted. \"Only excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother. If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter?\"\n\nHudson's wife, Sara, 32, gave birth on Friday to their daughter Millie at a hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona. Meanwhile, the Nationals did just fine without him, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 in Game 1 of the NLCS that night with teammate Sean Doolittle closing out the win in relief.\n\nDoolittle defended his teammate after the game.\n\n\"If your reaction to someone having a baby is anything other than, \u2018Congratulations, I hope everybody\u2019s healthy,\u2019 you\u2019re an a--hole,\" Doolittle told reporters afterward.\n\nMany others applauded Hudson's decision.\n\nDaniel Hudson skipping Game 1 should be a lesson for everyone. Chances are if the Nats can get by without him for a day, your office can get by without you for a day. Go do life stuff. Take a mental health day. Keep your cough at home. Everything will be fine. \u2014 DL (@davelozo) October 12, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re making $5.5 mil a year and your team needs you to close in the NLCS well, yeah, go see the birth of your 3rd kid or your 12th. Being a father is more important than a baseball game. Good for Nats closer Daniel Hudson, shame on any \u201chusband, father\u201d who thinks otherwise. \u2014 Tom Dougherty (@todougherty) October 12, 2019\n\nNationals manager, Dave Martinez, who was supportive of Hudson's decision, joked in the postgame press conference that he should name his daughter Anibala Sean, after Doolittle and Nationals starter Anibal Sanchez, who helped clinch the shutout in Hudson's absence.\n\n\"As important as our careers are to us as players, nothing is more important to us than our families,\" Doolittle told ESPN. \"Our careers will end someday, but family is forever. We sacrifice so much and we miss so much during our careers.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball instituted a three-day paternity leave policy in 2011 that has since been defended against detractors in multiple instances.\n\nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy, who was playing for the New York Mets in 2014, became one of the early faces of the policy when he faced criticism for missing the first two games of the season for the birth of his son.\n\n\"That never crossed, I don\u2019t think, my mind or her mind,\u201d Murphy said on TODAY about the possibility of playing in the games.\n\nHudson's daughter Millie joins the couple's two older daughters, Baylor, 5, and Parker, 2, to make them a family of five. Sara had been scheduled for an induction on Oct. 10 but was induced later than expected, according to ESPN.\n\nIt's also not as if Hudson could have planned that far ahead to schedule Millie's birth around a playoff game.\n\nHe was released by the Anaheim Angels to start the season, then pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays, who were far out of the playoff race, before being traded to Washington in July. He soon emerged as a vital part of the Nationals' bullpen after taking over the closer role.\n\n\u201cI went from not having a job on March 21st to this huge national conversation on family values going into the playoffs,\u201d Hudson said with a smile. \u201cLife comes at you fast. Man, I don\u2019t know how that happened and how I became the face for whatever conversation was going on.\u201d\n\nMillie might also be a good-luck charm. Hudson returned to close out a Nationals victory in Game 2 on Saturday, and then Washington beat the Cardinals again on Monday to put them one win away from their first World Series appearance in team history.", "description": "Washington Nationals pitcher Daniel Hudson said his family is his \"top priority\" after receiving criticism for missing a playoff game for the birth of his daughter.", "authors": ["Scott Stump"], "top_image": "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_42/1493694/daniel-hudson-misses-game-wife-birth-today-main-191015_90977d823d136b153cf7cfd726fff217.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
