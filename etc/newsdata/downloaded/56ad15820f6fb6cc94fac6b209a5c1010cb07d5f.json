Her name is Tagerem, and she worked in the temple of Sakhebu on the southwestern delta of the Nile in a revered position known as \u201cGod\u2019s wife\u201d to the sun god Re. She\u2019s about 2,300 years old \u2014 give or take a few years \u2014 and 16 and a half inches, roughly the size of a small newborn. She\u2019s the ideal woman of the Ptolemaic period, described as \u201cdemure\u201d yet \u201calluring.\u201d Perhaps because her upper torso has been lopped off.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell what she\u2019s thinking,\u201d Jacqueline Novak tuts dryly in front of the broken figure. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that these statues do tend to have a lower belly of some sort. It\u2019s not a complete washboard, which I do find comforting.\u201d\n\nWe step out of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Temple of Dendur and take a seat above the reflecting pools, just beneath the picturesque slant of the floor-to-ceiling windows. Novak sits cross-legged and empties the contents of her purse \u2014 a toothbrush, 31 dollars, a pair of black-and-white Adidas soccer socks \u2014 to unfurl the gray T-shirt she bought during a Bloomingdale\u2019s quest to find the perfect one for her show. She likes it \u2014 it\u2019s heathered and doesn\u2019t have that stripy effect under the stage lights \u2014 but it\u2019s still not the Platonic ideal. Every night for her acclaimed one-woman show, Get on Your Knees, which is ostensibly about blow jobs but is really about how we think about our bodies, she wears a variation on the same monochromatic palette: gray shirt, washed-out black jeans, and gray-and-white sneakers. It is an attempt to \u201cneutralize the form,\u201d she says, meaning the female body. Her body. \u201cWhich is kind of an irritating thing to feel like one has to do.\u201d\n\nNovak would prefer to be the opposite of poor Tagerem: just a floating head and nothing else. Or maybe a ghost. Whatever. The point is, she\u2019s constantly in her head, assessing not only the object but all the social meaning thrown upon it. The female form feels particularly burdensome. \u201cEvery day, you leave the house with goals and dreams and things to do,\u201d she says in Get On Your Knees. \u201cYou\u2019re forced to lug [your body] along like a sack of sex potatoes, constantly having to say \u2026 \u2018No taters for sale tonight, boys.\u2019\u201d\n\nGet on Your Knees became a sensation during its sold-out run at the Cherry Lane Theatre this summer, through a combination of critical praise and star power: Attendees have included Lorde, Amy Poehler, Emma Stone, and Sally Field. Now it has been extended for one final run at the Lucille Lortel Theatre, through October 6. (As for its life beyond, Novak would like to go on tour and film it as a special.) The show, which sits somewhere between a theatrical monologue and a stand-up comedy set, is Novak hitting her stylistic stride. Her work has always been ironically high-minded in a way you might expect from someone who studied creative writing and linguistics at Georgetown. She had been doing stand-up comedy for years but didn\u2019t begin to find her comedic voice until she immersed herself in the alt-comedy scene in New York with like-minded people who could apply basic gender theory to cum jokes. Then an invitation to participate in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival last summer challenged her to put together an hour-long set. Her friend the comedian John Early came on to direct, and Natasha Lyonne and Mike Birbiglia lent their names as producers.\n\nEvery day, you leave the house with goals and dreams and things to do. You\u2019re forced to lug it [your body] along like a sack of sex potatoes, constantly having to say \u2026 \u2018No taters for sale tonight, boys.\u2019\n\nI ask Novak how old she is, to get a sense of how long she\u2019s been at this, and she balks. While I could figure it out on my own, did this information need to be included? Because once someone knows your age, it locks you in their mind, and a whole bunch of judgment is placed upon you \u2014 whether you\u2019re far enough along in your career, what you should be doing with your life. And that\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re a woman, and a woman working in comedy, at that. Getting older has always bummed her out, like when she turned 17 and realized the movie Sixteen Candles no longer applied to her. It was this sense of constant loss; you could never go back. \u201cFuck it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m 36.\u201d\n\nNovak\u2019s mind is always abuzz, sometimes flitting between various observations like an overstimulated bumblebee surrounded by wildflowers \u2014 a result, she says, of her \u201cunmedicated ADD.\u201d And while there are plenty of digressions in Get on Your Knees, they inevitably loop back to a narrative, turning the act of giving a blow job into an epic bildungsroman. It\u2019s The Odyssey meets a French semiotician\u2019s wet dream. Like Odysseus, Novak learns to navigate the treacherous waters of female heterosexuality \u2014 how to avoid a toothy blow job and preserve the male ego (the Scylla and Charybdis of oral sex) \u2014 and, like a post-structuralist, she delights in dismantling the inherent, cough, patriarchy of language.\n\nShe takes particular interest in deconstructing the penis itself. After all, if you were to choose a part of the body to symbolize masculinity, the penis, Novak says, \u201cfeels like a desperate attempt to cover for its vulnerability, by going like, \u2018No, it\u2019s strong! And if you say it\u2019s not strong, I\u2019ll kill you!\u2019\u201d She devotes a section to dismantling all the words we use to prop up the phallus: rock-hard boner, penetrate, anaconda. In her hands, the penis becomes soft and delicate, like a flower. It\u2019s not a weapon of mass destruction but a drama queen who wilts on the fainting couch soon after climax. It is the most hysterical part of the male body.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as doing a bunch of jokes about penises, really, even though obviously I am,\u201d she says earlier that morning, over a breakfast of eggs and trout cr\u00eapes under the stern eye of a waiter at Caf\u00e9 Sabarsky. \u201cSomeone in an interview was like, \u2018Oh, what\u2019s your blow-job technique?\u2019 I was like, \u2018I\u2019d rather not answer that. Did you see the show?\u2019 Because I don\u2019t really have any opinions on blow jobs. It\u2019s an idea I\u2019m exploring more than anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I think my heterosexuality is a sham,\u201d she goes on. \u201cI just slowly socialized myself to the idea of the male body. I mean, I intuitively had crushes on boys in an abstract-gender way, versus bodily. And that\u2019s actually a big reason that I\u2019m asking myself, What is the penis? Because I\u2019ve never been like, Am I really into penises as an object? I had to adjust to, like, not being horrified by a penis.\u201d\n\nStill, ever since her childhood growing up in Westchester County, her ideas around sex have been startlingly precocious. When she was four years old, a little boy classmate asked her if she had a penis. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I have a vagina,\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cAnd then he goes, \u2018Does your mom have a vagina?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yes, but hers has feathers.\u2019 So I was young enough to have sort of a general feather perception. You know, like not pubic hair.\u201d Her teachers were amused, so when her mother came by, they recounted the story. \u201cWhen my mom walked out of the office, she flapped her wings,\u201d Novak laughs.\n\nA similar thing happened when a group of girls in elementary school asked her if she knew what a period was. She gave a clear textbook answer: that it occurs when the body sheds its uterine lining. \u201cThey were like, \u2018No! It\u2019s when you bleed out of your vagina!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe curse of real knowledge,\u201d she says, shaking her head. \u201cI was the fool.\u201d", "description": "Jacqueline Novak on her lyrical, epic deconstruction of the blow job in her one-woman show \u2018Get on Your Knees.\u2019", "authors": ["E.
