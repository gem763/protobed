Can you trust a decentralized computer network with your money?\n\nMost people still treat Bitcoin as a mythical pandora box which contains thieves, money launderers, scammers, terrorists, other people of the worst kind.\n\nHowever, outside the realm myths and fantasy, such statements are entirely false and misleading. Thousands of programmers develop the Bitcoin network every day, and mostly for free in their spare time, as it is an open-source community-driven project standing for personal freedom and financial inclusion. It is not perfect yet, but it gets better every day.\n\nThe answer to the question \"is it safe to use Bitcoin\" is yes, but it also depends on how well can you manage your security.\n\nIs it safe to use Bitcoin?\n\nIn its ten years of history, Bitcoin, when used and stored correctly, has proven itself to be a reliable financial instrument when it comes to storing value, secure borderless peer-to-peer money transfers, and accessibility.\n\nThe protocol itself is sturdy enough to withhold even the most sophisticated attacks, and most of the bad news surrounding Bitcoin hacks are due to the third-party service providers like centralized exchanges, wallet developers, or private key mismanagement.\n\nOf course, as with every other type of money, there are certain issues Bitcoin users need to know if they want to protect their wealth. These include Bitcoin price volatility, secure storage of cryptocurrency, use of insecure third-party services, and cybersecurity threats like hacking.\n\nAt the same time, we could also raise a question whether it is safe to use dollars and other traditional finance tools, as most of the money laundering and other nefarious activities are still conducted using traditional money. The conventional financial systems have proven to be prone to economic bubbles and crises, and the government-backed money tends to significantly devalue over time.\n\nThis is why we buy Bitcoin.\n\n\n\nBitcoin is a lifeboat. \ud83d\udea3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/44TwlnF6zJ \u2014 Rhythm Trader (@Rhythmtrader) March 20, 2019\n\nTherefore, it is safe to use Bitcoin, especially if you're willing to take responsibility for protecting your funds on your shoulders. And since the technology is still in development, it requires time and effort to learn how to handle it.\n\nSo, how do you safely handle your Bitcoins?\n\nHow to secure your Bitcoin?\n\nStoring Bitcoins\n\nThese are the vital steps to ensure that you\u2019re following the best Bitcoin security practices:\n\nRule number one is to take good care of your secret \u201cprivate key\u201d \u2013 the password for accessing and using your Bitcoins. (For more on choosing a wallet, follow this link ). If the private key is secure and no one else can get to it, then your Bitcoins are safe. But keep in mind that if you lose your private key, even you yourself won\u2019t be able to access your funds.\n\nChoose a reliable wallet that fits you, as it will act as a bank account to access your funds. They can be stored both online or offline.\n\nSecure Bitcoin hardware wallets by Ledger and Trezor.\n\nExchanging and spending\n\nWhen spending or exchanging your Bitcoins, it\u2019s important to choose the most reliable and trustworthy services. If you fall victim to fraud using a traditional bank card, laws and regulations may help you recover any losses. For Bitcoin, such protection is yet to come. Also, remember that payments with Bitcoins are non-repudiable \u2013 once you pay, the money\u2019s gone. If you make a mistake \u2013 say you pay USD 222.2 instead of USD 22.22 or send the Bitcoins to the wrong address \u2013 you can only rely on the goodwill of the receiver to get your money back.\n\nAnonymity issues\n\nYou may have heard about the anonymity Bitcoin users enjoy. Well, it\u2019s only partly true. While everyone can track any wallet and its content on the network, they can\u2019t identify the owner of the wallet. Bitcoin wallets and transactions aren\u2019t linked to personal data or identity. But there are alternate ways to find out the owners identity. For example, you may be required to reveal your identity when registering on a cryptocurrency exchange. That way all your transactions from the exchange may be traced back to your wallet. Still, if you need stronger privacy, the TOR browser, and other privacy solutions. There are many privacy-oriented Bitcoin wallets, too, as well as other cryptocurrencies with integrated privacy and anonymity features, such as Dash, Monero and Zcash.\n\nHacking\n\nOther Bitcoin risks are somewhat hard to control, but it\u2019s still important to know them and follow the latest news since the technology is still in development.\n\nOne theoretical risk is a 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain. In theory, if a group of Bitcoin miners controlled 51% or more of all the hashing power running the Bitcoin blockchain, they could potentially undo several latest transactions.\n\nIn fact, there was a moment, in 2014, when the mining pool Ghash.io came close to obtaining 51% of the whole Bitcoin network. But then some members of the pool voluntary left, decreasing its share and influence. Still, Bitcoin experts believe a \u201c51% attack\u201d is unlikely as its cost would exceed the potential benefits of the attack, and it would do little to no harm for more than 99% of the blockchain users. Such attack can\u2019t be used to steal Bitcoins or change older transactions. It affects only the most recent transactions, and the efficiency of the network could be disrupted for a moment, too. Essentially, any 51% attack would last for a short time before being quickly fixed by the Bitcoin community. The biggest damage would be done to the cryptocurrency\u2019s image.\n\nHacking poses a bigger risk when it comes to cryptocurrency exchanges, most of which are not regulated and, as history has shown, are hacked quite regularly.\n\nThe threat of a hack of the Bitcoin network may become real once a quantum computer is built, as it would be much more powerful than today\u2019s computers. But building it is expected to take years, and ways to withstand such attack is already in the works.\n\nRegulations\n\nAnother key issue to watch are regulations. More and more countries are likely to start introducing Bitcoin laws, which could affect how the cryptocurrency can be bought and spent, its legal and tax implications. Alongside the rules, new regulations may also grant Bitcoin users more rights, protection, and clarity.\n\nIn addition to the precautions, make sure to see these ten tips on Bitcoin security. If you follow the most common Bitcoin security rules, you are likely to use Bitcoin in the safest and most secure manner.\n\nAfter all, Bitcoin itself constitutes the safest money protocol ever built. Nevertheless, there are third-party services and individuals don\u2019t use adequate measures to secure themselves.
