In an interview, Mr. Hawley said about the practice of targeting ads to children based on their previous online behavior, \u201cI\u2019m concerned about some of the comments that F.T.C. officials have made where they seem to suggest that behavioral-targeted advertising is a good thing.\u201d He added, \u201cI mean, that sounds frankly crazy to me.\u201d\n\nOne such official is Andrew Smith, director of the F.T.C.\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, who has echoed industry talking points about how increased privacy protections could hurt the internet experience. He went off script at a Better Business Bureau conference last month to say that if creators are unable to monetize their content with behaviorally targeted ads (to which children are particularly vulnerable), YouTube would become \u201ca desert of crap.\u201d That prompted privacy advocates to call for his recusal from rule-making on the issue.\n\n[If you\u2019re online \u2014 and you are \u2014 chances are someone is using your information.

It also would raise the age covered by the law to 15 from 12, as well as tighten the requirement that a website seek parental consent to collect information if it has reason to believe a viewer is a child. The current standard is looser, and companies like Google and its subsidiary YouTube have abused it, knowingly targeting children for advertising .\n\nJust last month, the commission fined Google and YouTube $170 million for violating the children\u2019s privacy law by harvesting children\u2019s personal data and using it to target them for ads using cookies . While it was by far the F.T.C.\u2019s largest privacy fine leveled to date, it was a small sum for such flagrant violations. In Mr. Hawley\u2019s opinion, \u201cThe F.T.C. has just, in the last two months, gone very easy on YouTube and Google over blatant and widespread violations of COPPA.\u201d\n\nThe Markey-Hawley bill would give the commission clear direction on how to enforce the law, limiting the power of industry lobbyists and lawyers to influence agency decisions.", "description": "Regulators appear poised to cave to the tech industry.
