Everyone always has their opinion, but it has been a clean match.\n\n'I am sorry for the dismissal of Araujo because it was his debut. I did not think (it was a red card) and Dembele is a mystery.'\n\nDembele's second booking came after he reportedly said something to the referee \u2014 with Movistar claiming he commented: 'You're very bad'.\n\nValverde is unaware what was said but hopes he will not be given a longer suspension, with his side hosting Real Madrid in a fortnight.\n\nOusmane Dembele was sent off for dissent after Ronald Araujo was dismissed by the referee\n\nThe Barca boss added: 'It is difficult to get words from Dembele in Spanish. I haven't talked to him but I don't think it's too long a suspension.'\n\nMessi's goal was his first of the season in his fifth appearance in all competitions.\n\nValverde said: 'Leo grabs goals and when he finds form he will score more, but it is good for us that there are other players who score goals.'\n\nSevilla head coach Julen Lopetegui felt his side failed to take advantage of some early chances.\n\nValverde said that Messi will add more goals when he returns to form after his injury\n\n'We have faced (the match) with a lot of ambition and personality,' he said on Sevilla's website.\n\n'The first 35 minutes were totally ours with many chances, but in such a scenario when you don't score the law of football happens.\n\n'We were very good, but the first goal has done us a lot of damage. Now it is time to analyse the game and take advantage of this break to reset.'", "description": "Barcelona ended the game with nine men as debutant Ronald Araujo and Ousmane Dembele both saw red, the former for a professional foul and the France winger for dissent.", "authors": ["Press Association Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/00/19375026-0-image-a-105_1570404396615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
