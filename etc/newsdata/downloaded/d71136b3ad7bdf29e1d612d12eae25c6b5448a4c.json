Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina said in a letter Tuesday to Democratic leaders on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n\nThe letter was sent to Reps. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the committee\u2019s chairman, and Gerry Connolly of Virginia, chairman of the government operations subcommittee.\n\nThe subcommittee is scheduled Wednesday to hear from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) about the challenges it faces.\n\nMr. Jordan, the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, and Mr. Meadows, the ranking member on the subcommittee, said they had invited Mr. Cherrington to speak about the challenges he faces and his ability to conduct an investigation into Mr. Evans, Ward 2 Democrat and former Metro Board chairman.\n\nIn their letter, they describe how the Metro IG lacks independence that others enjoy: Mr. Cherrington must receive permission from the Metro Board before releasing a report, does not have an independent legal counsel and must go through Metro\u2019s human resources department to hire personnel.\n\n\u201cDocuments produced to the Committee also suggest that Evans may have attempted to misuse Mr. Cherrington\u2019s authority by directing him to initiate an investigation that would advance Evans\u2019s personal business interests,\u201d Mr. Jordan and Mr. Meadows wrote. \u201cAlthough we understand that you may invite Mr. Cherrington to testify in October, we assume that you would want to ensure now-as early as possible-that Mr. Cherrington could conduct a thorough and independent examination of Evans\u2019s misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe letter says that Democrats denied request to invite Mr. Cherrington because he is not a member of the CIGIE and that Mr. Cummings is breaking House rules that allow a witness from the minority to testify at every hearing.\n\nMr. Cummings and Mr. Connolly did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
