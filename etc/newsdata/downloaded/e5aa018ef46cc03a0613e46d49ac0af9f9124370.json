He referred last week to a small but influential coterie of anti-Trump Republican intelligentsia as \u201chuman scum.\u201d And he punctuates his incessant narrative of victimization with frequent tweeted reminders of the near-lockstep support he commands from within his Republican base.\n\n95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nJohnson is now readying for a Dec. 12 general election, a contest he probably wanted. Unlike Britain\u2019s 2016 referendum result, the majority of the members of the current House of Commons are probably not in favor of Brexit, and even more oppose the \u201cno-deal\u201d crash out of the European Union that Johnson has said he\u2019s willing to execute. The prime minister, though, has tied his political fortunes to a hard-line, pro-Brexit base of support and will be hoping their fury at the latest delay \u2014 Britain got another formal extension from the European Union to conclude their divorce deal by the end of January \u2014 will translate into a more effective parliamentary mandate before Christmas.\n\nIn the meantime, he has borrowed from Trump\u2019s populist demagoguery, casting Parliament as the enemy of the people and his opponents as guilty of \u201csurrender\u201d and \u201cbetrayal.\u201d He rejected criticism of his inflammatory language as \u201chumbug.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as the two leaders slug it out with their opponents, the political parties they lead are feeling the heat. Trump has viciously turned against any former lieutenant, top administration official or Republican politician who has publicly contradicted him or criticized his actions. His proxies, including broadcasters at right-wing Fox News, have smeared career officials who delivered potentially damning testimony about Trump\u2019s conduct. This week, that included Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Soviet refugee turned American war hero who served as a Ukraine expert within Trump\u2019s White House.\n\nIn America\u2019s febrile political moment, noted Post columnist Greg Sargent, for the president and his allies, \u201cthere is no greater expression of disloyalty to country than a display of disloyalty to Trump.\u201d\n\nA number of senior Republican politicians condemned the \u201cshameful\u201d pro-Trump attacks on Vindman\u2019s patriotism. Many in private express a deeper disquiet with the course of events, especially the reckoning that may follow a possible House impeachment of the president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn hushed conversations over the past week, GOP senators lamented that the fast-expanding probe is fraying their party, which remains completely in Trump\u2019s grip,\u201d reported The Post\u2019s Robert Costa and Philip Rucker. \u201cThey voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won\u2019t soon be discovered.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s little indication for now that any of these senators will risk Trumpist ire and back his constitutional removal. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re going to take it all grudgingly \u2014 and privately, perhaps, in disgust \u2014 but they\u2019re not going to give up the farm,\u201d Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union, told The Post.\n\n#BackBoris to get Brexit done.\n\n\n\n\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Only @BorisJohnson can take our country forward and deliver on the people's priorities.#GE2019 pic.twitter.com/3pTkzI6vFy \u2014 Conservatives (@Conservatives) October 29, 2019\n\nIn Britain, Johnson has already tested the unity of his ruling Conservatives. His tight embrace of a Brexit at all costs has been boisterously received by the country\u2019s jingoistic tabloid press, and it may persuade pro-Leave voters otherwise eyeing the Brexit Party of populist gadfly Nigel Farage to remain in the Tory fold.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cthe approach has come at the expense of a full-scale rupture among the Conservatives,\u201d my colleague Griff Witte wrote earlier this year. \u201cThe most successful party in British political history has been divided for decades over the country\u2019s membership in the E.U., with room both for fervent supporters and opponents.\u201d\n\nA series of anti-Brexit or Brexit-skeptic Conservative lawmakers, including Johnson\u2019s own brother, either quit the party or stepped down from senior-level posts. Some analysts now see the Conservative Party as a faction that stands for little beyond Johnson\u2019s quest for power \u2014 something that remains firmly in his reach as the opposition Labour Party struggles with its own divisions under the stewardship of leftist Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n\u201cSurviving Tory moderates \u2026 kid themselves that the party is still theirs, as if it hadn\u2019t swelled with Brexit fanatics with no interest in governing,\u201d British sociologist William Davies wrote earlier this month. \u201cThese men are opportunists, for whom nationalist fervor and chaos provide an opening to seize power. And a party in the grip of collective mania is more vulnerable to such machinations than one with a coherent ideology.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA similar diagnosis could be offered for Republicans who have sought to normalize Trump\u2019s behavior. But the polarization that now defines politics in both the United States and Britain was weaponized by Trump\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s parties long before either came to power. And its grim effects are now entirely in view.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re perilously close to the point at which there may no longer be a national consensus that there\u2019s anything constitutionally problematic about using governmental powers to advance one\u2019s own pecuniary and electoral interests,\u201d legal scholars Marty Lederman and Benjamin Wittes wrote in the Atlantic, gesturing to the climate of conspiracy theory and denial propagated by Trump\u2019s backers.\n\n\u201cElectoral uncertainty should not be cause for alarm in a mature democracy, and true democrats do not shy away from a polling booth,\u201d wrote Guardian columnist Rafael Behr. \u201cStill, it is hard to shake the fear that British politics will be even angrier and more divided after an election campaign than it is now.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
