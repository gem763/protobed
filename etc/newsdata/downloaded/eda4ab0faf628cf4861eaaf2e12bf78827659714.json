The round closed on Thursday.\n\n\"We've been researching the CBD industry for over a year,\" Carole Buyers, one of BIGR's partners, told Business Insider in an interview. \"It was the passage of the Farm Bill in 2018 that really gave us the green light to go ahead and invest.\"\n\nRE Botanicals was founded by John Roulac, a veteran of the organic-foods space who previously started Nutiva in 1999. The Colorado CBD company merged with the South Carolina-based Palmetto Harmony in August.\n\nCannabidiol, or CBD, is a compound in cannabis that doesn't get you high. Sellers claim the compound has a variety of benefits, including anxiety relief and help with sleep and pain. But, so far, there's little solid evidence to back up those claims. Still, Wall Street analysts say CBD could be a $16 billion market by 2025.\n\nCoffee, hummus, and now CBD\n\nBuyers, along with her partners Bill Weiland and Duane Primozich, focuses on investing in organic-food companies. The partners' portfolio includes High Brew Coffee, the Colorado hummus brand Hope Foods, and the grain-free-baked-goods company Suzy's.\n\nRead more: Here's what CBD does to your brain and body\n\nBuyers said a lot of the people who shop for organic-food products would likely be interested in organic CBD supplements. There are also similarities in how the businesses are structured, with the emphasis on organic supply chains.\n\nStill, it took a lot of research to pick out the right company to back in the competitive CBD-startup market. She said they wanted to back an organic-certified company with a clean supply chain.\n\n\"We wanted no product from China,\" Buyers said. \"We wanted no extractions from hexane, butane, or propane. And last we wanted the product to be organic or non-GMO.\"\n\nBIGR invested in RE Botanical's seed round in April and doubled down on the investment with the Series A.\n\nTo Buyers, part of the challenge with investing in CBD was being early in a space that few mainstream venture funds have invested in.\n\nRead more: Square has started working with a select group of CBD startups while other payments rivals shy away from the trendy substance\n\n'Being early and going out on a limb'\n\n\"We pride ourselves with being early and going out on a limb,\" Buyers said. In her view, CBD as an ingredient in food will be somewhat \"faddish,\" so the best way to invest in the space is investing directly in the supplement itself.\n\n\"We believe that CBD will ultimately be regulated like a supplement,\" Buyers said. RE Botanicals, for its part, sells USDA-certified organic CBD in the form of tinctures and oral capsules.\n\nBIGR Ventures partner Carole Buyers. Courtesy of BIGR Ventures\n\nThe CBD industry \u2014 like any frontier space \u2014 has come under scrutiny over mislabeled products and playing fast and loose with constantly shifting regulations.\n\nBusiness Insider reported on the mislabeling of popular CBD products in California in April. Only 15% of popular products tested by a California lab actually contained the amount of CBD claimed on the label, and some of them contained dangerous pesticides and other chemicals.\n\nProducts from RE Botanicals weren't among those tested.\n\nOn top of that, Buyers said she and her partners had to show the investors in her fund \u2014 her limited partners (LPs) \u2014 that they were comfortable with the regulatory environment around CBD.\n\n\"We provided an overview of the industry to our LPs before we landed on RE Botanicals,\" Buyers said. \"We did our research, we educated them to give them a heads up we knew that there were certain things that needed to happen on the regulatory side to de-risk the investment.\"\n\nBIGR Ventures isn't the first mainstream fund to invest in CBD. In February, Greycroft led a $3.3 million seed round into Prima, a CBD company founded by The Honest Co.
