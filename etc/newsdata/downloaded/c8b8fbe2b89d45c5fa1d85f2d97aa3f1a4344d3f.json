If that group play to their best, England will win,\u201d he told BBC 5 Live on Friday.\n\n\u201cIt starts with individual performance. The front row, Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell are world class. Billy Vunipola, Ben Youngs, Manu Tuilagi and Elliot Daly must step up to that level.\n\n\u201cTom Curry and Sam Underhill have got to obliterate the opposition. Then England have got to assume that they make no mistakes at the weekend \u2014 no offsides, no penalties, nothing. They have got to play the perfect game.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand demolished Ireland 46-14 in the quarter-finals, their 18th successive World Cup win. However, Dawson thinks Jones\u2019s decision to start with Farrell at inside centre and George Ford at fly-half will give England a creative edge even though he has some concern over Ford\u2019s reliability.\n\n\u201cJones wants to play fast and furious with lots of phases,\u201d added Dawson. \u201cHe sees how New Zealand reorganise as a weakness.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that George Ford was recalled. I have the tiniest bit of concern about him playing under the most enormous pressure. He sometimes hasn\u2019t been able to replicate his club and international form. We\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nWhatever happens, Dawson believes fans are in for a treat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure-cooker environment,\u201d he said. \u201cFor England, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger than playing New Zealand for a place in the World Cup final \u2014 it\u2019s the stuff of dreams.\u201d", "description": "England will beat reigning champions New Zealand in Saturday's Rugby World Cup semi-final if their big players come to the party, according to former England scrum half and World Cup winner Matt Dawson.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444836640&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O0SF", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
