He declined to say whether he himself would support remain or leave.\n\n\u201cA Labour government would secure a sensible deal based on the terms we have long advocated, including a new customs union with the EU, a close single market relationship, and guarantees of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections. We would then put that to a public vote alongside remain. I pledge to carry out whatever the people decide, as a Labour prime minister.\u201d\n\nLabour members to push for anti-Brexit stance at conference Read more\n\nThe Norwich South MP Clive Lewis, one of the founders of the campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, said some activists were likely to feel \u201cdespondent\u201d on reading Corbyn\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a good Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand some people will be despondent that our leader isn\u2019t going to campaign for the position that the vast majority of our members would like him to. But I\u2019m a glass half full kind of guy, and no one should despair, because we\u2019re a movement, and we\u2019ve never been about individuals.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s about whether you want to see an outward-facing, progressive country \u2013 or are you an inward-looking, socialism-in-one-country-type movement that\u2019s backward-looking? That\u2019s the challenge now before us.\u201d\n\nSome members of the shadow cabinet, including John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, have already signalled that they would campaign for remain in any future referendum, whatever deal a Labour government was able to secure from Brussels.\n\nBut the Labour leadership fears that would render the negotiations moot \u2013 and see Corbyn swept out of Downing Street if the public voted leave, as David Cameron was in 2016.\n\nAsked by Sky News on Wednesday whether he would campaign for leave or remain, he said: \u201cMy job is to deliver the option chosen by the British people.\u201d\n\nWe must stop Brexit in any form, councillors tell Jeremy Corbyn Read more\n\nRemain campaigners fear Corbyn\u2019s blunt restatement of Labour\u2019s position \u2013 including his insistence that voters be presented with a leave option \u2013 could be used to try to stifle debate in Brighton.\n\nMore than 90 constituency Labour parties (CLPs) have submitted motions to next week\u2019s conference, with most calling for Labour to commit immediately to campaigning for remain in a referendum, whatever the result of negotiations with Brussels.\n\nTheir representatives will hammer out a composite motion, which will then be put to the conference for a vote.\n\nThey believe they could win but some are wary about being seen to be in direct conflict with Corbyn, whose position has the backing of the major Labour-supporting unions.\n\nUnite general secretary, Len McCluskey, who has made no secret of his own reluctance to overturn the result of the Brexit referendum, has been urging Corbyn to set out his own stance, and encourage the party to fall in behind him.\n\nSome campaigners already appear to be backing away from a confrontation in Brighton. Mike Buckley, director of Labour for a People\u2019s Vote, said, \u201cit\u2019s inevitable that Labour will end up supporting remain in a referendum, because ultimately we all know there\u2019s no Brexit that is going to do better for jobs and workers \u2013 so in a sense what happens on Brexit at conference is a moot point, because this is where we\u2019ll end up.\u201d\n\nThe final decision about what would be included in a Labour manifesto would be taken at a \u201cclause V\u201d meeting, which includes shadow cabinet members, as well as representatives of the unions, and the parliamentary labour party.\n\nHowever, it could be difficult for them to ignore a composite motion passed at conference, particularly if the manifesto is being drafted just weeks later.\n\nCorbyn has been under pressure from close allies, including the shadow cabinet office minister, Jon Trickett, to ensure a \u201ccredible\u201d leave option is presented to Brexit-backing Labour voters.\n\nTrickett said: \u201cThere are three options facing the country. One is a no-deal Brexit, which is horrendous. But voting against a no-deal Brexit is not the same as voting against Brexit, because I think it\u2019s possible to get a Brexit which works for jobs.\n\n\u201cI think we have now narrowed down the options to essentially a Labour Brexit or remain. That does justice to the referendum; but hopefully also to those people who feel they want to remain.\u201d\n\nA number of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock, have also joined the cross-party MPs for a Deal group, who would like the opportunity to support some form of Brexit. Kinnock only supported the backbench Benn bill aimed at forcing Boris Johnson to extend article 50, to allow more time for a deal to be reached.\n\nCorbyn believes Jo Swinson\u2019s decision to position the Liberal Democrats as a pro-revoke party \u2013 in the event that the Lib Dems should win a general election \u2013 has opened up space for Labour to portray itself as more moderate on Brexit than either of the other two main parties.\n\nThe shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, tweeted that the Lib Dems were \u201cprepared to overturn the people\u2019s decision without going back to the people\u201d, while Labour will \u201coffer the people the chance to vote on the way forward\u201d.\n\nRichard Burgon MP (@RichardBurgon) The Tories? Prepared to exploit Brexit to deliver for the 1%.\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems? Prepared to overturn the people's decision without going back to the people.\n\n\n\nOnly Labour will offer the people a chance to vote on the way forward and end the Brexit deadlock. https://t.co/VvzPlde1hr\n\nBut Alan Johnson, the former Labour cabinet minister who led the party\u2019s remain campaign in 2016, warned that the policy was too complicated. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get slaughtered, in the sense that you\u2019d have to have a very large foot in the door to keep people on the doorstep long enough to explain it,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s World at One.\n\nLabour MPs on both sides of the Brexit divide are concerned about the idea of a general election campaign being dominated by Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU, rather than the domestic issues on which Corbyn has strong arguments to make.\n\nThe Leeds West MP Alex Sobel, another member of Love Socialism Hate Brexit, said: \u201cNinety per cent of the PLP want a referendum first \u2013 even some of those in leave constituencies who are not so exercised about a referendum \u2013 because a general election will become a proxy for the Brexit issue.\u201d\n\nOn Corbyn\u2019s position, he said: \u201cThe fact that we are now firmly supporting a referendum in basically any circumstances is a huge move forward. The lack of clarity remains on where the party would stand in that referendum.\n\n\u201cWe all recognise that you can\u2019t force everybody in the Labour party to support staying in the EU \u2013 but the party itself should have a position; and so should Jeremy himself as leader.\u201d", "description": "Activists and MPs set for battle over party\u2019s official Brexit line at next week\u2019s conference", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a70f9d55dd0d9f99b89583630fef6e2b5fbc2a/0_268_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c46488e8eb712ab3a27bda32bcc55fa4", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
