On Monday, they tracked a stolen \u00a325,000 BMW bike using a \u00a3300 tracking unit hidden on it.\n\nThe technology took them to a street in the Isle of Dogs, where a heavy smell of petrol helped narrow the search to an industrial unit.\n\nAt this point, they called in police rather than enter the building alone. Inside, they discovered the crooks had run away, leaving behind the evidence of the trade.\n\nPictured: The grimy chopping shop on the Isle of Dogs, where criminals take bikes they've stolen to be taken apart for profit\n\nThis BMW bike was among the \u00a375,000 worth of merchandise uncovered at the site by two bikers sick of police inaction\n\nTo the delight of the men, they found the BMW still intact. Amid the bikes and parts was also found a machete and drugs.\n\nChris Scorah wrote under their post: 'Another great job guys well done and thank you from the biking community for being our guardian angels.'\n\nMark Hewitt added: 'Outstanding. Hope this shows the Met you're an asset with your knowledge of motorcycles.'\n\nDenny Humes said: 'Good work. Seems motorbike crime is but rising. Taking out chop shops is key.'\n\nSpeaking today a member of the group said: 'This is the first commercial grade chop shop we've actually pinpointed.\n\nPictured: Some of the bikes hauled back to the Isle of Dogs to be disassembled in east London\n\nOnce the pair had uncovered the stolen goods (pictured) on the Isle of Dogs, they called the police and reported their findings\n\n'I think it shows that we're using the connections we have and the data available to start pinpointing where these operations are taking place.\n\n'We expect to hit more of these in the future as it is the best way of disrupting the criminal gangs involved.\n\n'We carry body armour. We try to make it as safe as possible and take quite a few steps to mitigate risk. If we feel things might get a bit hairy, we just request police assistance to make sure everyone behaves.'\n\nHe added: 'We felt frustrated that nobody was really taking the issue seriously and we try to do this free of charge.\n\nThe stolen bikes are taken apart at this shop and then sold for parts, but the two bikers who uncovered the enterprise say police inaction led them to track it down independently\n\nPictured, left, the machete found at the chopping shop and, right, cannabis and grinders also found in the space\n\n'The Met have refused to officially endorse us at a senior level and we are currently working with various bodies to set up a few initiatives.\n\n'We get called upon by various entities when vehicles go missing, so that we can use our expertise in assessing what we think has happened and to secure the vehicles back to their owners\n\n'A number of vehicles were seized for an in-depth analysis by the Police and we suspect we've seriously disrupted the gang operating out of that location.'\n\nA spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We were called to a report of a stolen vehicle being located at 7.56pm.'", "description": "The intrepid pair wearing body armour also found a huge machete and drugs at the premises on the Isle of Dogs in East London which was packed with bikes being disassembled.", "authors": ["Mark Duell", "Sebastian Murphy-Bates For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20087552-0-image-a-44_1571841834702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
