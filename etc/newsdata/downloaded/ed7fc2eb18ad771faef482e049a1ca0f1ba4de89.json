I\u2019ve played basketball. Come on man, that\u2019s a dumb question\u201d\n\nReporter tried to press further, saying he hadn\u2019t made a 3 in a game.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, I haven\u2019t. But I\u2019m an All-Star so \u2026\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia coach Brett Brown hit out at the criticism of Simmons jumper as well.\n\n\u201cThe groundswell of this thing is bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand it, but it gains it\u2019s own life and he obviously listens and I hope he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to shoot, he doesn\u2019t want to shoot. It\u2019s always about \u2018OK that sounds great, but what about April, May, and June\u2019 and I understand that.\n\n\u201cYou know, to me, he is a 23-year-old All-Star.\u201d\n\nIt came as Brown tried to shift the focus, claiming Simmons could be a true force at the other end of the court.\n\nSpeaking to The Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s Keith Pompey, Brown said he believes Simmons has a high ceiling to reach at the defensive end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important and we understand it, especially (during the post-season),\u201d Brown said of Simmons shooting more 3s this season. \u201cWe have to set the stage.\n\n\u201cBut my centre point, where I see the world with him, is I think he can be the best defensive player in the NBA.\u201d\n\nBrown had Simmons guarding the likes of LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Anthony Davis and Russell Westbrook and was even considered one of the more successful defenders of Kawhi Leonard as he caught fire during the second round of the playoffs.\n\nWhile the comments may add more pressure to the young star, his teammate Embiid is confident Simmons will be able to get the job done.\n\nThe pair were seen shooting 3\u2019s for the best part of an hour after training earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like shooting 3\u2019s but this year since we have Ben willing to take those 3\u2019s, maybe it\u2019s going to put my game onside,\u201d Embiid told a reporter. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll shoot them so I can do my job inside.\u201d\n\nBen working on that 3 pic.twitter.com/4q3rUA0evg \u2014 Drew Corrigan (@Dcorrigan50) October 4, 2019\n\nWhile this week\u2019s media commitments had the 76ers players remembering their second round loss to the Raptors last season with Embiid saying \u201cI didn\u2019t show up\u201d and admitting he had \u201ca lot of regrets\u201d, Philadelphia do have some NBA legends on their side.\n\nFormer Celtics star Paul Pierce was in Sydney this week and said he expected a \u201cmonster year\u201d for Simmons.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be an All-Star, Philly will win a lot of games, and he\u2019s probably going to be an MVP candidate,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the game\u2019s great all-round talents already, and he\u2019s still young.\n\n\u201cI expect him to improve on what he\u2019s already done, eventually he\u2019ll develop that jump shot, that\u2019s the knock on him right now, but you\u2019re gonna see greatness out of this kid.\u201d\n\nHe also praised the 76ers recruitment in the off-season with former Celtic Al Horford singled out by Pierce as one that will help \u201cdevelop his game on and off the court, developing mentally, develop him into a strong leader\u201d.", "description": "Social media has been flooded with videos of Ben Simmons taking three-points shots all off-season but the Aussie star is getting sick of the scrutiny.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e6579a50fbb50d0650fb3f2b670e9a84?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
