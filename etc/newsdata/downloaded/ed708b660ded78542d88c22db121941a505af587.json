REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo\n\nLondon-based BP said third-quarter underlying replacement cost profit, the company\u2019s definition of net income, fell 40% from the year earlier period to $2.3 billion. That exceeded a forecast of $1.73 billion in a company-provided survey of analysts and compared to $2.81 billion in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe drop will not come as a surprise to investors after BP indicated earlier this month that it would take a non-cash charge of $2 billion to $3 billion in the quarter as it gets closer to disposing of assets worth $10 billion by the end of 2019, a year ahead of schedule.\n\nGraphic: BP Q3 profits here\n\nThe $2.6 billion charge nevertheless pushed the firm to its first quarterly net loss, of $700 million, since the second quarter of 2016.\n\nAlthough profit came under pressure, cashflow, seen as the main measure of BP\u2019s underlying performance, was unchanged from a year earlier at $6.1 billion.\n\nOil and gas production, excluding its share from its 19.75% stake in Russia\u2019s Rosneft, was down 2.5% from a year earlier at 2.568 million barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result of maintenance at several high-margin fields and a two-week disruption to production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Barry.\n\nA 17% drop in oil prices in the third quarter from a year earlier also weighed heavily on profits of other energy companies including Italy\u2019s Eni and Norway\u2019s Equinor.\n\n\u201cBP delivered strong operating cash flow and underlying earnings in a quarter that saw lower oil and gas prices and significant hurricane impacts,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement.\n\nBP earlier this month announced Dudley will retire next year following a tumultuous decade at the helm of the company. He will be succeeded by 49-year-old Bernard Looney, BP\u2019s head of upstream.\n\nGraphic: BP Q3 cashflow here", "description": "BP posted a sharp drop in third-quarter profit on Tuesday, hurt by weaker oil prices and lower production, but still beat expectations even as it took a one-off charge of $2.6 billion linked to large asset sales.", "authors": ["Ron Bousso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446097919&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0E6", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
