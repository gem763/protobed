Barclay is due to meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier today in Brussels.\n\nThe British government and the European Commission also said Thursday that the U.K.'s Brexit negotiators have submitted documents setting out \"ideas\" on replacing the backstop, the mechanism to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nCoveney said that Dublin is being asked to replace a \"guarantee around the border question\" with a promise that \"somehow well do our best to try to solve this issue in the future but we don\u2019t know how just yet.\"\n\nHe added that while the \"mood music\" is improving over Brexit negotiations, a \"big gap\" remains between the U.K. and the EU on alternatives to the backstop.\n\n\"And in order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government, which we simply haven't received yet,\" he said.\n\nCoveney also reiterated his warning that a no-deal would be catastrophic for Ireland, calling the scenario \u201cvery damaging, it\u2019s very difficult, and it poses huge questions for politics and potentially for the management of civic unrest in the context of Northern Ireland around the border.\u201d", "description": "UK has not yet put forward \u2018credible proposals\u2019 to replace the backstop, says Simon Coveney.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-1005077156-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
