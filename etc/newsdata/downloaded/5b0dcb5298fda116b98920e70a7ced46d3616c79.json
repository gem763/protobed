Cosplay and nerd culture have become more mainstream and while that means some awesome costumes, so too do we see an increase in badly made knockoffs. Some of them are supposed to be \u201csexy,\u201d others funny, but they usually end up just being plain bad. We\u2019re looking at the worst of the worst of 2019.\n\nI said this last year, but it bears repeating: This is not about defining what constitutes a good or bad \u201csexy\u201d costume. Halloween is a great time to celebrate your sexuality and have fun with fashion \u2014 as is any time of year, for that matter.\n\nRather, we\u2019re here to look at the ridiculous, the laughable, and the offensive. In other words, the best of the worst borderline copyright infringement that the folks at Yandy, ForPlay and beyond have bestowed on us for this year\u2019s All Hallow\u2019s Eve.\n\nNicest Neighbour. (Image: Yandy)\n\nThe \u2018Winner\u2019\n\nNicest Neighbour\n\nMuch in the vein of that Bob Ross aka \u201cHappy Tree Painter\u201d costume, Yandy has decided to sexify Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighbourhood with \u201cNicest Neighbour\u201d (Yandy), complete with a red belly sweater, shorts, and a stiff necktie that isn\u2019t even attached to a shirt (puppets not included). Excuse me, but Fred Rogers was already sexy enough on his own.\n\nMiss Impeachment, Beyond Burger, Sold Out Chicken Sandwich, Tater Thot (Image: Yandy)\n\nOoh, That\u2019s Topical\n\nMiss Impeachment | Beyond Burger | Sold Out Chicken Sandwich | Tater Thot\n\nThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re back with another round of oh-so-topical Halloween costumes! After all, \u201cSexy Op-Ed Anonymous\u201d is soooo 2018. This year, it was mostly food-related costumes \u2014 I\u2019m guessing because we all stuffed our faces to try and survive this horrible year.\n\nWe\u2019ve got \u201cBeyond Burger\u201d (Yandy) and \u201cSold Out Chicken Sandwich\u201d (Yandy), along with a delightful pun stuck on a disappointing costume with \u201cTater Thot\u201d (Yandy). But if you still want to get political, we\u2019ve got \u201cMiss Impeachment\u201d (Yandy) a tribute to... nice butts and systemic justice?\n\nGalaxy Trooper, Human Space Scavenger, Universe Warrior, Dark Star Lady (Image: Yandy)\n\nNothing But... Space Battles\n\nGalaxy Trooper | Human Space Scavenger | Universe Warrior | Dark Star Lady\n\nThe Skywalker saga is finally coming to an end this year with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Why not celebrate with the finest pieces of borderline copyright infringement with these totally-not-Star Wars Halloween costumes?\n\nThe \u201cGalaxy Trooper\u201d (Yandy) outfit looks all right enough, were it not for it having the solar system\u2019s worst fake helmet. Then there\u2019s \u201cHuman Space Scavenger\u201d(Yandy) \u2014 not to be confused with all those non-human ones \u2014 as well as the absolutely ridiculous \u201cUniverse Warrior\u201d (Yandy).\n\nAll of that said, I\u2019m kinda digging the fake Darth Vader costume... except for the fact that it looks cheap as hell and it\u2019s called \u201cDark Star Lady\u201d (Yandy). Like, come on, that\u2019s just silly.\n\nFuture Is Female, I\u2019m Blue Alien, Blast Off (Image: Yandy,Image: ForPlay)\n\nSpace, the Weirdest Frontier\n\nFuture Is Female | I\u2019m Blue Alien | Blast Off\n\nThere were enough fake Star Wars costumes to warrant their own category, but I still had a few extra spacey outfits that simply had to be mentioned. You can be a possibly radioactive weirdo with \u201cI\u2019m Blue Alien\u201d (Yandy).\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cBlast Off\u201d (ForPlay), an astronaut costume that says it\u2019s based on a \u201cmovie character\u201d but for the life in me I can\u2019t figure out which one. The one on the left is called \u201cFuture Is Female\u201d (Yandy) and it made me want to die.\n\nDefiant Doll, It\u2019s a Wrap, Bone Daddy, Dream Killer, Got The Juice (Image: Yandy,Image: ForPlay,Image: Leg Avenue)\n\nScary (But Not Really)\n\nDefiant Doll | It\u2019s a Wrap | Bone Daddy | Dream Killer | Got The Juice\n\nIt\u2019s time to get spoooooooky! Except no, not really. \u201cIt\u2019s a Wrap\u201d (ForPlay) handled the mummy game while \u201cGot the Juice\u201d (ForPlay) channeled not-Beetlejuice... except both of them are wearing these weird half-pants that can\u2019t look or feel good after walking around all right.\n\n\u201cDream Killer\u201d (ForPlay) is overall bad but gets a pass for having a creepy meat skin hoodie. Then, for those wanting to be creepy in completely uncomfortable ways, there\u2019s the sexified Annabelle of \u201cDefiant Doll\u201d (Yandy).\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the bone guy. A big trend in costumes this year is folks dressing up like skeletons. No surprise, it\u2019s a universally flattering look and really brings out the inner self (get it?). That doesn\u2019t mean all the costumes are good, though. There are plenty of bad skeleton looks. But I\u2019ve gotta be honest: The main reason I picked this one is because it\u2019s called \u201cBone Daddy\u201d (Leg Avenue) and I just couldn\u2019t help myself.\n\nHear Me Roar, Anime School Girl, Heartless Tin, Despicable Human, Scary Scoops (Image: Yandy,Image: Starline)\n\nCute (But Not Really)\n\nHear Me Roar | Anime School Girl | Heartless Tin | Despicable Human | Scary Scoops\n\nThis one is a bit of a hodge-podge, but it\u2019s mostly things that are normally designed to look cute but in this case, are anything but. The Wizard of Oz hath returned (following ForPlay\u2019s 2018 costume set) with \u201cHear Me Roar\u201d (Yandy) and \u201cHeartless Tin\u201d (Yandy) \u2014 although I couldn\u2019t find a sexy male Dorothy anywhere!\n\nOtherwise, there\u2019s the childhood-ruining \u201cDespicable Human\u201d (Yandy) or \u201cAnime School Girl\u201d (Starline) which is making choices with the Sailor Moon-inspired getup. Finally, the cosplay of the year with Stranger Things\u2019 sailor suit, this time going by \u201cScary Scoops\u201d (Yandy). After all, nothing is scarier than minimum wage.\n\nGhost Hunter, Super Suit, Vile Villain, Space Soldier, Femme Fatale Warrior (Image: Yandy,Image: ForPlay)\n\nSuperher-Oh No\n\nGhost Hunter | Super Suit | Vile Villain | Space Soldier | Femme Fatale Warrior\n\nMost of these costumes are to be expected. The Ghostbusters \u201cGhost Hunter\u201d (Yandy), the Captain Marvel \u201cSpace Soldier\u201d (ForPlay), and Black Panther\u2019s \u201cFemme Fatal Warrior\u201d (Yandy)... complete with a truly terrible name.\n\nEven the weird mesh \u201cSuper Suit\u201d (Yandy) that turns The Incredibles into some seriously kinky shit. But I just wanted to point out one thing: \u201cVile Villain\u201d (Yandy), the newest incarnation of the Joker ensemble, costs $100. How? And why? Just go to Goodwill, folks. You can find like 40 leisure suits there.\n\nCuddle Dream Gamer, Ken, Ryu, Mushroom Damsel (Image: Starline,Image: ForPlay)\n\nGreetings Fellow Gamers\n\nCuddle Dream Gamer | Ken | Ryu | Mushroom Damsel\n\nShout-out to my gamer squad!!! We\u2019ve got the \u201cCuddle Dream Gamer\u201d (Starline) and our favourite \u201cMushroom Damsel\u201d (Starline). And then, the Street Fighter duo themselves, Ryu (ForPlay) and Ken (ForPlay). Hint hint: Best couples costume ever, maybe?\n\nVengeful Creature, A Whole New World, Island Princess, Desert Prince, Beautiful Belle (Image: Yandy,Image: ForPlay,Image: Leg Avenue)\n\nLegally Not Disney\n\nVengeful Creature | A Whole New World | Island Princess | Desert Prince | Beautiful Belle\n\nWhy is it that fake Disney costumes are always the worst? \u201cVengeful Creature\u201d (Yandy) looks like she has a bag of poop on her head, while \u201cDesert Prince\u201d (Leg Avenue) might as well be carrying a load around in those pants. You\u2019ve got \u201cA Whole New World\u201d (Yandy) donning a shower curtain on her legs and \u201cBeautiful Belle\u201d (Yandy) in a weird crimp skirt that I can\u2019t imagine looks good on anyone.\n\nBut I\u2019m especially weirded out by \u201cIsland Princess\u201d (ForPlay) Moana was, like, definitively underage. I don\u2019t want to see Moana\u2019s underboobs.\n\nFrozen Queen, Alice In Chains, Sleeping Beauty, Naughty Red Riding Hood (Image: Harmonia Costumes)\n\nStill Not Disney\n\nFrozen Queen | Alice In Chains | Sleeping Beauty | Naughty Red Riding Hood\n\nThese costumes come from Harmonia, a site that normally specialises in outfits to wear to Burning Man or Coachella. So it\u2019s no surprise that these costumes, which tend to go for hundreds of dollars, feel like they\u2019d be more at home in a fancy rave than at your friend\u2019s Halloween party. On one hand, they\u2019re clearly well made. On the other, they\u2019re making some weird choices.\n\nThe Chosen One, To Infinity Space Ranger, Playtime Sheriff, Bo Peep This (Image: ForPlay)\n\nTotally Not Disney Trust Us You Guys (Also WTF)\n\nThe Chosen One | To Infinity Space Ranger | Playtime Sheriff | Bo Peep This\n\nSo, these exist now.
