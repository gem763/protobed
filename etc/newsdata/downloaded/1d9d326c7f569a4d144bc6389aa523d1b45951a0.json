The debate engulfed the conservative intellectual world and sparked a heated, and occasionally ridiculous, internecine knife fight on right-wing Twitter. (At one point, a Catholic journalist attacked French \u2014 a Game of Thrones fan \u2014 for liking \u201cdragon porn.\u201d)\n\nAnyone watching from the outside was probably confused, in part because of how much Ahmari and French have in common. Both are conservative Christians opposed to gay marriage and abortion. Both view social conservatives as outnumbered and besieged by a hostile secular culture.\n\nIn Ahmari\u2019s telling, however, French \u2014 a Never Trumper, Evangelical Protestant, and First Amendment lawyer \u2014 is a \u201cclassical liberal\u201d whose cultural conservatism disguises the fact that he shares liberals\u2019 assumption that social choice is the greatest good. Conservatives like French, he charged, accept secularism and licentiousness as the inevitable outcome of liberal democracy; they\u2019re resigned to the modern order and content to carve out a separate, rapidly shrinking, sphere.\n\nOn Thursday, several hundred people packed into the Catholic University of America\u2019s cryptically named Institute for Human Ecology to watch Ahmari and French debate in person. Several hundred more watched by live-stream. Ross Douthat moderated. Wits dubbed it \u201cThe M\u00eal\u00e9e at CUA.\u201d\n\nThose hoping for an intellectual Rumble in the Jungle were disappointed. The debate was messy, mismatched \u2014 French, it quickly became apparent, is a far better debater \u2014 and ultimately deteriorated into an ugly, ad hominem spat that was frankly uncomfortable to watch. But it was an illuminating look at tensions within the conservative movement and perhaps a microcosm of things to come.\n\nAhmari is part of a faction of \u201cyoungish, mostly Roman Catholic\u201d conservatives who want to aggressively prosecute the culture war and defend the nuclear family. They\u2019re about as far from libertarian as you can get: They\u2019re skeptical of capitalism, which they see as corrosive to families and community, and they\u2019re happy to embrace the powers of the state if it can help their cause.\n\nAhmari opened the debate by arguing that conservatives should do more to fight phenomena like \u201cDrag Queen Story Hour\u201d \u2014 including, if necessary, by law. He sounded myopic and a little autocratic. It was a bad opening gambit.\n\n\u201cWe have a nation of 320 million,\u201d French said; events like \u201cDrag Queen Story Hour\u201d are \u201cchoices people make in a free nation.\u201d He called Ahmari\u2019s attitude \u201cfree speech for me but not for thee,\u201d and said he would set a precedent that could easily be used to shut down conservative viewpoints.\n\nThe real crisis, French argued, is larger and cultural and cannot be solved by political means. Millions of Americans \u201cdo not have a relationship with Jesus Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cTens of millions of Christian American men\u201d are \u201caddicted to porn.\u201d\n\nOn this point they agreed \u2014 sort of. \u201cToo much of the intellectual firepower of the right has been focused on lawyers and litigation,\u201d Ahmari said. But \u201cas much as it is valuable to fight things in the courtroom, there are cultural battles.\u201d Christianity \u201ccannot be just a religion for an elite elect\u201d in a \u201cdegenerate society\u201d that \u201cthrows every possible obstacle\u201d in the way of religious morality.\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d French interrupted. \u201cIn your assault on \u2018David French\u2013ism,\u2019 you said I make too many cultural arguments.\u201d\n\nAfter an interminable amount of time spent on \u201cDrag Queen Story Hour,\u201d the debate finally got to the real elephant in the room: whether Christians can support Trump. \u201cThis has been the most pro-life administration since Roe,\u201d Ahmari said, and Trump controls judicial appointments. Yet \u201cyou\u2019re on the record saying we need to defeat Trump at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nWe \u201ccatastrophize\u201d presidential elections, French responded. Trump causes conservatives to \u201cdefend conduct you never would have before\u201d and \u201cwreck your public witness with people outside the faith.\u201d He disparaged the idea of the Flight 93 election. He argued that the better analogy is not a hijacked plane but \u201cturbulence\u201d: People charge the cockpit, \u201cchoke out\u201d the pilot, then realize the error too late.\n\n\u201cWhen mainstream Democratic senators speak of the Knights of Columbus as an extremist organization akin to the KKK,\u201d Ahmari said, \u201cthat tells you something about the mind-set of the kind of secular liberalism we\u2019re facing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re to love our enemies,\u201d French said. \u201cWe\u2019re to bless those who persecute us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should also recognize them as enemies,\u201d Ahmari said, \u201ceven as you love them.\u201d\n\nFrench refused to condone an ethic of ends-justify-means. At Harvard Law School, he noted, there was a group of liberal, feminist professors that he assumed \u201chated my guts.\u201d But when it came down to it, they stood up for due process in Title IX cases.\n\nThen things really went off the rails. Ahmari suggested that if French were president, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wouldn\u2019t have gotten onto the Supreme Court. He clearly touched a nerve; French freaked out and angrily invoked his service in Iraq.\n\n\u201cYou were a JAG, right?\u201d Ahmari said.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t SEAL Team Six,\u201d French replied. But \u201cat 37 years old, I was morally convicted that I could not support a war unless I was willing to fight in it myself.\u201d It is a defining moment in one\u2019s life, he said, when you don\u2019t have to get in a Humvee but do it anyway. Ahmari\u2019s attack on him, he added, was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nThe morning after the debate, the reviews started rolling out, and the winner was French.\n\n\u201cAhmari\u2019s primary beef against political liberalism,\u201d Andrew Egger wrote in the Bulwark, is simple: \u201cRights-based liberal democracy has failed to stamp out practices that Ahmari finds abhorrent.\u201d\n\nPeter Suderman made a similar argument in Reason. \u201cAhmari is upset about things that are happening in the culture, and he wants them to go away \u2014 or at least to be castigated publicly by someone in a position of power. He doesn\u2019t really have a plan to make anyone\u2019s life better.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not a religious conservative of either the French or Ahmari persuasion. If I had to choose, I\u2019d rather a right-wing intelligentsia guided by good faith and shared norms, not a Manichean, zero-sum vision of politics. For that reason, I\u2019m glad French won the debate handily.\n\nBut I have to wonder: For all the conservative pundits declaring him the winner, do actual conservative voters think like French? I\u2019m not sure they do.", "description": "A wonky weeknight debate between two elites on the American right, New York Post opinion editor Sohrab Ahmari and National Review writer David French, turned into an ugly clash between dueling visions of conservatism.", "authors": ["J.
