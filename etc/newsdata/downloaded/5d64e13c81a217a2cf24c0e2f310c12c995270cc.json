Before my closing remarks, I went around the room and asked for any good take-aways or final thoughts. Overall, people were excited. One knew she had to develop better relationships with her peers. Another mentioned that he got too emotional and made bad decisions. Yet another said he always complicated plans and needed to improve his ability to simplify.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThen one of the executives sighed loudly and mumbled, \u201cThis is like a 'Rocky' movie!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cWell, this feels when you watch a 'Rocky' movie. When it\u2019s over, you want to run, you want to train \u2014 you want to get some gloves and become a boxer, for crying out loud!\u201d he joked, earning some laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut a few days later, you are back in the same rut, eating cookies and sitting on the couch. That\u2019s what this feels like. Right now, everyone is all excited about leadership. Everyone is talking about what they can improve. But in a few days, once everyone is inundated with emails and conference calls and customer complaints and all the other drama that goes on here, we will all slide back to our old selves. Just like when you watch a 'Rocky' movie.\u201d\n\nGood leadership is not an inoculation that you get and then you magically become a good leader. Being a good leader is a campaign\u2014it\u2019s a fight, a struggle, a daily test that you have to work at every day.\n\nI thought about that statement for a moment.\n\nThen I nodded my head and said, \u201cYou know what? You are right. You are exactly right. Good leadership is not an inoculation that you get and then you magically become a good leader. Being a good leader is a campaign \u2014 it\u2019s a fight, a struggle, a daily test that you have to work at every day. Does anyone think you become a good boxer after watching a 'Rocky' movie?\u201d I asked the group.\n\nThey chuckled and shook their heads.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cOf course not. You have to hit the heavy bag. You have to do your road work. You\u2019ve got to put in the time shadowboxing and sparing. That is how you get good. And it\u2019s the same thing with leadership. You have to work at it. You have to pay attention to it. You have to assess your performance every day and see what you can do better and where you can improve. That\u2019s what you need to do.\"\n\nI continued, \"Leadership is the most important factor in the success of any organization. But leadership is not easy. Study it. Read about it. Ask for feedback. Own your mistakes. Make incremental improvements in yourself as a leader. And if you do that, you will become a better leader for you, for the people on your team, and for this company. And \u2014 in the long run, just like Rocky, you and your team will win.\u201d\n\nI wrapped up the training session and sent them on their way \u2014 not with a simple shot of motivation that would last a few days, but with the realization that good leadership requires a long-lasting campaign to sharpen leadership skills and that the work of improving as a leader is never done.\n\nJocko Willink is a retired Navy SEAL Officer, author of \u201cExtreme Ownership,\u201d \u201cDiscipline Equals Freedom Field Manual,\u201d \u201cThe Dichotomy of Leadership,\u201d \u201cMikey and the Dragons,\u201d and the \u201cWay of the Warrior Kid\u201d series, and hosts the top-rated podcast: \u201cJocko Podcast.\u201d He is the CEO of Echelon Front, the world\u2019s premier leadership consultancy.
