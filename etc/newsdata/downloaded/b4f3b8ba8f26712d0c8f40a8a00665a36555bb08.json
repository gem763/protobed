Categories will reflect drivers' status based on their loyalty to Uber, with higher statuses earned through actions such as completing more trips.\n\nAll drivers who opt into Uber Pro will automatically receive blue status, with diamond being the highest level.\n\nTo unlock rewards in the gold, platinum or diamond tiers, drivers will need to maintain a rating from passengers of at least 4.85 out of five, as well as a low cancellation rate.\n\nDrivers will also earn points on each trip they complete during fixed three-month periods, with more points for trips completed during peak hours.\n\nAs well as the degree scheme, rewards will include free vehicle inspections, 24/7 roadside assistance and discounted gym memberships.\n\nThe Uber Pro scheme is already available in eight countries including the U.S., Brazil and Australia, and will be fully rolled out in the U.K. by January 2020.\n\n\"We want to do more to help drivers and their families build towards their future,\" Melinda Roylett, Uber's general manager for the U.K., said in a press release Thursday.\n\nUber is currently available in more than 40 towns and cities across the United Kingdom.", "description": "Uber is rolling out its loyalty program out across the U.K., which will see drivers offered free access to more than 900 university degree courses.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105887924-1556798450906gettyimages-1137478527.jpeg?v=1556798560", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
