This ongoing decline in the average exchange rate has meant that most of its losses have been clawed back, and it will have only a modest impact on the fuel price,\" the AA said. \"International oil prices also declined slightly as October wore on.\"\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the AA noted that oil ticked up slightly from its late-October plateau and this could be the start of a strengthening trend into November.\n\n\n\n\"Whatever happens to the oil price and rand from this point affects the price motorists will be paying at the pumps at Christmas. It remains to be seen whether this month's reductions will continue for the rest of the year,\" the AA concluded.", "description": "Fuel prices are set for slight drops across the board in the wake of oil price retreats in October, according to the AA.", "authors": ["Compiled Carin Smith"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4006/a030b50e46ba4a3f84d6c150565f27ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
