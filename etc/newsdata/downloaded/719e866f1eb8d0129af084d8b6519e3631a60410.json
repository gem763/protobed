Just start where you are. \"\n\nThe ultimate goal, she says, \"is to be saving and investing 20% of your take home pay.\" But you don't have to start with that much right away: \"I know it's a lot, so start with 1%, start with 2%.\" Then, aim to gradually increase that amount over time.\n\nFailing to invest is like letting money fall out of your wallet every day, she explains. When you keep money in a regular savings account, your annualized return is tiny \u2014 most people earn far less than 2% on their savings accounts. But if you put your money to work in a diversified portfolio, the returns have historically been about 6%.\n\nAnd, if you invest in equities, or stocks, \"it's been about a 9.5% annualized returns,\" Krawcheck says. Stocks come with more risk than bonds and cash but have the potential for higher returns. Whether you choose to invest in a diversified portfolio or stocks, the returns they can offer \"is a lot more than the close-to-nothing that you get from saving \u2014 and the nothing that you get from spending,\" she says.", "description": "Ellevest CEO Sallie Krawcheck shares the \"ultimate goal,\" in terms of how much of your paycheck you should be putting to work.", "authors": ["Kathleen Elkins"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104303980-sallie_leather.jpg?v=1532563904"}
