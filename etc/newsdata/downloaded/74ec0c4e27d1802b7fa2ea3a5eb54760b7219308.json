The event has been held in countries around the world since it began in 2000, with previous host cities including London, Toronto and Singapore, and most recently Bangkok.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dancers perform the opening number at last year\u2019s IIFA awards.

The industry grew 12.2% last year, including not only Hindi-language movies but also titles in regional languages such as Tamil and Telugu, according to a report released in March by Ernst & Young (EY) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI).\n\nThe huge south Asian diaspora in North America, Britain and the Gulf region has traditionally been the major overseas market. Blockbuster releases in parts of North America and Britain are huge events, with passionate fans often queueing for hours.\n\nBut Indian films have also been making huge inroads elsewhere \u2013 most notably in China, where the black comedy Andhadhun, nominated for best picture at the IIFA awards, grossed almost $50m (\u00a340m) .\n\nAamir Khan, the star of the two top-grossing Indian films in China, has an ardent following there and is known by many as \u201cNan Shen\u201d, or male god.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest From left: Nushrat Bharucha, Varun Dhawan, Ayushman Khurrana, Riteish Deshmukh, Kartik Aaryan, Karan Johar, Kriti Sanon, Arjun Kapoor and Boman Irani perform at the 2018 IIFA awards.

According to the EY-FICCI analysis, industry revenues are expected to grow from 174.5bn rupees (\u00a32bn) in 2018 to 236.1bn rupees in 2021.\n\nOther nominees for best picture at the IIFA awards include the spy thriller Raazi, the swashbuckling epic Padmaavat, and Badhaai Ho, a comedy-drama about middle-aged motherhood. They show how Bollywood has long since moved from the cliched all-singing, all-dancing films of the past.\n\nThere were fears for the industry when major streaming services arrived in India a few years ago, changing the way many Indians consume films. But the likes of Netflix and domestic players such as Hotstar have instead been a shot in its arm, providing a new medium for releasing films and more money for new productions. Unlike regular cinematic releases, they are not subject to India\u2019s notoriously strict censors.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Actors Gulshan Grover and Nawazuddin Siddiqui arrive at last year\u2019s IIFA awards.

Netflix, for example, recruited the superstars Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Saif Ali Khan for its acclaimed series Sacred Games.\n\nLast week, Netflix signed a deal with Karan Johar, one of the highest-profile producers in Bollywood, to produce films and series exclusively for its platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be P-H-A-T \u2013 pretty hot and tempting,\u201d said Johar.", "description": "20th international Indian film academy awards will be held in Mumbai this week", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc181df4ab42745e17d63498082fc778c53aa485/275_616_4058_2435/master/4058.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2451caa20613c293849991d333b29036", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
