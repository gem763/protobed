Randall (D-At Large), chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, speaks at a debate Wednesday. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nDemocrat Phyllis J. Randall\u2019s surprise victory four years ago \u2014 in an unusual three-way race \u2014 made her the first African American to chair Loudoun County\u2019s Board of Supervisors.\n\nNow, Randall is working to build on that success and turn the country\u2019s wealthiest county into a more active voice on issues such as gun violence, climate change and women\u2019s rights, drawing on Loudoun\u2019s growing diversity, frustration over recent racist incidents in schools and opposition to President Trump.\n\nRandall, 54, faces a tough reelection battle against Republican John C. Whitbeck. As the two major-party candidates in an election contest that also includes independent Robert Ohneiser, they have opposing views on the role the county of 413,000 residents should play in increasingly blue Northern Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis election is about putting people in office who are communicating with people who share their values and who want to move both Loudoun and the entire area forward,\u201d said Randall, who has linked her campaign \u2014 and her effort to erase the GOP\u2019s 6-to-3 majority on the board \u2014 to a giant push by Democrats to win control of the General Assembly in Richmond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about all these really important issues that have come to surface today: gun rights, obviously, climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, at the local level, it\u2019s about quality-of-life issues.\u201d\n\nWhitbeck argues that managing Loudoun\u2019s explosive growth should be the chief priority of the Board of Supervisors. A former state party chair who resigned in 2018 amid heated intraparty divisions, he said he would focus on traffic congestion, school funding and protecting the area\u2019s steadily eroding rural corridor from future development.\n\n\u201cAs chairman, I would stick to those issues that the Board of Supervisors could actually affect,\u201d said Whitbeck, 43, who has outraised Randall by 40 percent, with $557,000.\n\n[Metro\u2019s IG finds new problems with Silver Line construction]\n\n\n\nRandall faces a tough reelection against Republican John C. Whitbeck, the former chair of the Virginia Republican Party. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nHome to sprawling residential developments, office towers and a cluster of computer data centers that handles 70 percent of the world\u2019s Internet traffic, Loudoun is in the midst of a fundamental transformation that is set to increase with the pending arrival of Metro\u2019s Silver Line.\n\nThe county was more than 80 percent white in 2000, when 170,000 people lived there. It is now nearly 40 percent Asian, Latino and African American, U.S. census estimates show.\n\nRandall says the county\u2019s leadership should reflect that diversity, noting that her board colleagues include five white men: Ralph M. Buona (R-Ashburn), Tony R. Buffington Jr. (R-Blue Ridge), Ron A. Meyer (R-Broad Run), Geary M. Higgins (R-Catoctin) and Matthew F. Letourneau (R-Dulles); two white women: Supervisors Suzanne M. Volpe (R-Algonkian) and Kristen C. Umstattd (D-Leesburg); and an African American man, Supervisor Koran T. Saines (D-Sterling).\n\nRepublicans Buona, Higgins and Meyer are not seeking reelection, but the GOP nominees for their seats are also white men. The slate of Democrats seeking office includes four women \u2014 one of whom is African American \u2014 and an African American man.\n\n\u201cThe county leadership does not look like the county,\u201d Randall said.\n\nThat dynamic has served as a backdrop in the race.\n\nRandall said her election initially spurred opposition that was sometimes hateful.\n\nIn 2016, she tried to block one critic from posting what she considered \u201cslanderous\u201d comments on her official Facebook page \u2014 a move the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit later found was unconstitutional.\n\n[What does this Va. official have to do with whether Trump can block people on Twitter?]\n\nDuring a contentious meeting last year that involved regulating target shooting, one angry gun rights advocate called Randall \u201cMaxine Waters,\u201d referring to the African American Democratic congresswoman from California who has been a favorite target for conservatives.\n\n\u201cIn my head, I was like: \u2018Don\u2019t laugh,\u2019 \u201d Randall recalled. \u201cBecause it was clearly racist.\u201d\n\n\n\nCandidates for the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chair, from left: independent Robert Ohneiser, Randall and Whitbeck, at a debate in Leesburg, Va. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nRandall said she has mostly campaigned on her ability to work with her Republican colleagues. She led an effort to update the county\u2019s \u201cComprehensive Plan\u201d for the first time in nearly two decades, steering higher-density development to areas near the Silver Line and adding protections against development encroaching into rural areas.\n\nA former mental-health counselor, she has focused on funding more social services for lower-income residents and spearheaded the reopening of a drug court that diverts offenders with addictions to treatment programs.\n\nShe also helped lead the charge for a 62 percent pay raise for county supervisors that kicks in next year. That measure, approved in a 5-to-4 vote, elevates the chair\u2019s annual salary to $81,100, the vice chair\u2019s pay to $73,363 and pay for the other supervisors to $66,826 in a county where the median household income is $125,900.\n\nWhitbeck, who in 2013 endured a brief controversy over an anti-Semitic joke he made as party chair, has modeled parts of his campaign around Loudoun\u2019s changing demographics. He denounced the racist bullying inside schools, which included nooses hung from trees at one building entrance. And he has met with ethnic-community leaders to talk about the importance of diversity.\n\nA family law attorney who also focuses on cases related to mental health, Whitbeck says he, too, wants to increase social services in Loudoun, proposing a new position in the county attorney\u2019s office that would focus on mental-health issues.\n\nHe\u2019s has attacked Randall over the salary increase for supervisors, arguing that the county\u2019s elected offices are essentially part-time jobs that should not garner that much pay.\n\n\n\nWhitbeck, center, talks to supporters after the debate Wednesday. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nAmong Whitbeck\u2019s chief proposals is to add campus-based police officers to every elementary school, an idea that gained some traction in March after protesters walked past security to enter an Ashburn elementary school.\n\nThe demonstrators were protesting a Black History Month exercise at the school, where students were asked to pretend to be runaway slaves using the Underground Railroad.\n\n[A wealthy, diversifying school system confronts racism and hate.]\n\n\u201cI agree with them in principle, but they shouldn\u2019t be able to go into a school and stage a protest without permission,\u201d Whitbeck said about the demonstrators, calling the school exercise \u201creally racist.\u201d\n\nRandall, who said she has supported expanding the school resource officer program for years, also condemned that school exercise.\n\nWhitbeck said he is mainly concerned about controlling development. He has proposed allowing rural landowners to sell density rights to developers who are willing to build in already heavily populated areas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grappling with traffic that has steadily gotten worse, we\u2019re grappling with a housing shortage that has steadily gotten worse,\u201d Whitbeck said. \u201cIt has become less about partisanship and more about good policy.\u201d\n\nAt a debate inside a Leesburg recreation center Wednesday, the mood was mostly partisan. Most members of the standing-room audience were Randall supporters, including some gun-control advocates in red Moms Demand Action T-shirts. A group of young Whitbeck supporters greeted people driving in with signs accusing Randall of raising taxes and supporting higher tolls on the privately owned Dulles Greenway toll road.\n\nQuestions covered topics such as land-use policy and a need to diversify the economy away from its heavy reliance on the computer-data-center industry. Toward the end, Randall cast the election as a referendum on Loudoun\u2019s identity, noting that Whitbeck had supported Trump and former Senate candidate Corey A. Stewart (R), the outspoken chair of Prince William Board of County Supervisors.\n\n\u201cBecause we are so close to Washington, D.C., we feel that Trump effect,\u201d Randall said. \u201cIt would be even worse not to just feel it, but to experience it on the board, and that\u2019s what could happen if you don\u2019t have the right people who serve on the Board of Supervisors.\u201d\n\n\n\nMembers of the group Moms Demand Action cheer for Randall at the debate on Wednesday. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nThe remark drew loud cheers from her supporters, boos from the Whitbeck crowd and a smirk from the Republican candidate, who again attacked Randall for the pay hike for county supervisors.\n\n\u201cYou know who didn\u2019t get a 62 percent pay raise next year? Teachers, first responders, county employees,\u201d Whitbeck said.\n\nSome voters said afterward that they didn\u2019t like the idea of bringing national and state politics into a local race. \u201cI just think she\u2019s too partisan,\u201d said Del Nylec, 82, who is white and a Whitbeck supporter.\n\nBut Tom Wilson, who is African American, said Randall\u2019s message resonated with him. \u201cWe all have to be included, and with the leadership at the top, there seems to be an attempt to divide,\u201d said Wilson, 72, referring to the president.\n\nAt the same time, he said, he cared more about the fact that Randall worked to get his neighborhood street paved. \u201cThose things mean a lot,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA wealthy, diversifying school in suburban D.C. confronts racism and hate\n\nVa.
