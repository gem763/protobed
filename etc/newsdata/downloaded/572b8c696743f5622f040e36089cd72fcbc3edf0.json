Pregnant women also have to be careful about what they put on their skin, as products containing potent acne-fighting ingredients \u2014 like prescription retinoids, over-the-counter retinols, hydroquinone, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, to name a few \u2014 are not safe during pregnancy.\n\nThis, understandably, can come as bad news to moms-to-be with acne and other skin conditions that pregnancy can often make even worse. What\u2019s more, some of these ingredients should still be avoided even after giving birth \u2014 especially if you\u2019re breastfeeding, since topicals like retinoids can be absorbed into the skin then excreted into breast milk, or simply transferred to a baby\u2019s skin upon contact. But the data on lactating mothers is limited, so it can be confusing to know exactly what is or isn\u2019t safe to use while breastfeeding.\n\nTo help you navigate what is already a stressful time, we spoke to eight dermatologists about what ingredients to absolutely avoid during pregnancy (and breastfeeding), alternative ingredients to look for, and the best products expectant mothers can use to tackle problems like acne, dry skin, dark spots, and more. But before using any, Dr. Jennifer MacGregor of Union Square Dermatology says that, regardless of your skin issue, it\u2019s best practice to \u201cget a recommendation from your dermatologist and check with your OB before trying to conceive, or as soon as you find out you are pregnant.\u201d The same goes for once the baby has arrived: If you have any questions about the safety of any product, speak to your doctor and pediatrician.\n\nBest non-retinoid products to treat acne\n\nThe Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% Unfortunately, retinoids (and retinols), the Vitamin A\u2013derived holy-grail ingredient that works wonders on both acne and fine lines by promoting skin-cell turnover, are considered unsafe to use during pregnancy. \u201cThose molecules have pretty good data showing that they can affect embryo development in the first trimester,\u201d says Dr. Abigail Waldman of Mohs and Dermatologic Center at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cEven though most of the studies were done when the medication is taken orally, we believe that it is absolutely contraindicated to use any cream or lotion with those ingredients at least during the first trimester. But I generally say avoid it during all of pregnancy.\u201d For breastfeeding moms, the data is less clear, but the dermatologists we spoke to generally agree that it\u2019s best to avoid oral or topical retinoids and retinols during lactation, too. According to Waldman, \u201cThere are no data studying it in lactating mothers and in breast milk, so it\u2019s kind of one of those unknowns. I generally recommend not using it when breastfeeding.\u201d So how should pregnant women address acne if many go-to products contain retinoids and salicylic acids (another ingredient to avoid during pregnancy)? All eight of our experts recommend using azelaic acid, a topical also used to treat rosacea, that works by killing bacteria found in pores and decreasing the body\u2019s production of keratin. Dr. Michelle Park of Washington Square Dermatology says azelaic acid makes a fantastic substitute for retinols. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite topical acne treatment to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding,\u201d she says. \u201cIt helps clear redness and acne, as well as decrease pigment production, so it helps with the dark marks that acne can leave behind.\u201d MacGregor agrees, noting that \u201cazelaic acid has a subtle brightening effect.\u201d Although typically prescribed by doctors (under the name Finacea, for example), azelaic acid can be found over the counter, including in this creamy formula from The Ordinary that came specifically recommended by Park. $8 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nIn addition to azelaic acid, New York City\u2013based dermatologist Dr. Cybele Fishman says that pregnant women can use \u201ctopical erythromycin (prescription) and all over-the-counter topical sulfur, zinc, and niacinamide treatments.\u201d From the latter category of over-the-counter products, Fishman recommends the sulfur-based acne medication, Acnomel, as well as The Ordinary\u2019s niacinamide and zinc blemish treatment. (Park; Dr. Nava Greenfield of Brooklyn\u2019s Schweiger Dermatology Group; and Dr. Yoon-Soo Cindy Bae, a clinical assistant professor at New York University who also works at the Laser and Skin Surgery Center of New York, also agree that sulfur-based products are safe to use to treat acne while pregnant or breastfeeding.)\n\nAcropass Trouble Cure As is the two-step patch from Acropass \u2014 as long as you take care to make one important change when it comes to using it, according to Park. The first part of the Acropass patch (which Rio also recommends) includes sanitizing the blemish with a swab soaked in salicylic acid, so she advises skipping that part and using regular alcohol instead. But otherwise, our experts say the product is safe \u2014 including its microneedles (in general, microneedling is considered safe during pregnancy, but other procedures like Botox and fillers are not). $18 at Soko Glam Buy\n\nBest non-retinoid products for brightening dark spots\n\nSkinCeuticals CE Ferulic Vitamin C is an effective ingredient that can also take the place of retinoids when it comes to treating dark spots and general skin-tone issues while pregnant or breastfeeding, according to Waldman and Park. \u201cUsed in conjunction with sunscreen\u201d \u2014 more on that below \u2014 \u201cvitamin C not only has properties that boost collagen production and has a retinod-like effect, but also works as an antioxidant that helps fight sun damage,\u201d Park explains. Of all the vitamin-C formulas out there, she told us she trusts one above the rest: \u201cI always stick with Skinceuticals CE Ferulic acid for its efficacy, and the research they have put into their product.\u201d Bae also recommends Skinceuticals\u2019s vitamin C serum for hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and discoloration. $166 at Dermstore Buy\n\nThe Ordinary Vitamin C Suspension 23% + HA Spheres 2% $6 at Sephora Buy\n\nThe Skinceuticals CE Ferulic may be prohibitively expensive if you\u2019re trying to save money for all the other things you need for your newborn, but Park says that, \u201cfor about half the price, you can try Drunk Elephant\u2019s Vitamin C.\u201d She adds that \u201cThe Ordinary also has a low cost option,\u201d too.\n\nBest moisturizers for pregnant women\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream $16 (was $19, now 16% off) \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a moisturizer for the face, I would recommend products that contain hyaluronic acid, which is incredibly hydrating and will plump the skin,\u201d says Park, who adds that \u201chyaluronic acid is a natural substance found in our body\u2019s tissues that\u2019s naturally there anyway, so it\u2019s not like introducing a foreign chemical.\u201d (Other acids, however \u2014 including some alpha hydroxy acids/AHAs and beta hydroxy acids/BHAs \u2014 should either be avoided or used sparingly, according to most of the pros we talked to.) Neutrogena\u2019s gel-cream is Park\u2019s (and, incidentally, our beauty hobbyist Buzz Bissinger\u2019s) go-to pick for an affordable moisturizer that gets the job done. She says \u201cit has a lot of benefits, including moisturizing and fighting fine lines,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s just an overall great moisturizer.\u201d $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nWhen looking for a moisturizer while pregnant or breastfeeding, Greenfield \u2014 who is currently pregnant herself \u2014 cautions against using products that call themselves anti-aging, because that means they\u2019ll likely contain either AHAs or BHAs. She also notes that, because \u201cskin can become sensitive during pregnancy and very dry during breastfeeding, you may need to change what you use more often.\u201d Right now, she\u2019s switching between C\u2019est Moi\u2019s Gentle Moisture Lotion and Belli\u2019s Healthy Glow Facial Hydrator, which contains vitamin C and is formulated specifically for pregnant and breastfeeding women.\n\nCerave Moisturizing Cream for Normal to Dry Skin For those who prefer a true cream to a hybrid one or a lotion, Park and Greenfield also recommend this gentle moisturizer by CeraVe \u2014 a brand that took the top spot in our list of the best body lotions for dry skin. Park adds that a cream like this \u201cwill keep more moisture in the skin than a lotion.\u201d $16 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nGlytone Enhance Brightening Complex AHAs and BHAs are both popular types of skin brighteners and exfoliants, but, according to MacGregor, \u201cthey disrupt the skin barrier and enhance penetration of other topicals, including untested substances.\u201d She and another dermatologist we spoke to say its best to generally avoid AHAs and BHAs (which include salicylic acid) if pregnant or breastfeeding. But others, including Fishman and Dr. Shinjita Das at Massachusetts General Hospital, say there are some topical acids \u2014 including glycolic, lactic, malic, and mandelic acid \u2014 that are considered low-risk and okay to use (though Das warns to avoid letting a baby\u2019s skin touch any areas where they may be applied). This face cream, recommended by Park, contains azelaic acid and glycolic acid, both of which, she says, will \u201chelp with acne but also to even out skin tone.\u201d $74 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest serums for pregnant women with very dry skin\n\nThose who can get extremely dry skin know that sometimes a moisturizer alone won\u2019t deliver all the hydration you need. In instances when \u201ca topical moisturizer isn\u2019t cutting it, you can use a hydrating serum in conjunction with the moisturizer,\u201d Park says. For quenching super thirsty skin while pregnant or breastfeeding, she recommends SkinCeuticals\u2019s Hyaluronic Acid Intensifier or the Hydrating B5 Gel (which also contains hyaluronic acid).\n\nThe Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 For a more affordable serum with hyaluronic acid to use on extra dry skin during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, Park recommends The Ordinary\u2019s HA with B5 (which Strategist beauty writer Rio Vera-Newton also swears by). $7 at Sephora Buy\n\nBest sunscreen for pregnant and nursing women\n\n\n\n\n\nEltaMD UV Pure Broad-Spectrum SPF 47 (4 oz.) $20 (was $25, now 20% off) In addition to using the above products, the dermatologists we spoke with also noted that keeping out of direct sunlight \u2014 or regularly using a mineral sunscreen (or a moisturizer with SPF) if you\u2019re exposed to it \u2014 will help keep skin issues at bay while pregnant or breastfeeding. In fact, Greenfield told us that \u201cstrict sun avoidance\u201d is one of the most important things you can do to prevent hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and discoloration. That means wearing \u201cprotective clothing, a hat, and a broad spectrum mineral/physical sunscreen such as EltaMD Pure.\u201d The brand is generally beloved by derms (it took the top spot in our list of best sunscreens for face), and MacGregor notes that EltaMD\u2019s tinted sunscreens with SPF 41 or SPF 44 are a good option if you\u2019re looking for one that functions more like a tinted moisturizer. Park, Nagler, and Waldman also stress using a mineral sunscreen (which typically contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide as their main active ingredients) over a chemical one, as mineral formulations sit on the surface of skin to block UV rays, where chemical ones seep into skin and suck UV rays in before reflecting them. $20 at Dermstore Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
