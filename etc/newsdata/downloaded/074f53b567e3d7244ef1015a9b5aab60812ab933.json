Whatever happened to Hunter, where the h*** is he?,' Trump railed as a charged up crowd cheered.\n\n'Where is Hunter? Fellows, I have an idea for a new t-shirt? I love the cops, but let's do another t-shirt. Where is Hunter? Where is he?'\n\nThe shirts were released during President Trump's (pictured) campaign rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Thursday night where he spent time mocking Hunter Biden and his father Joe Biden\n\nHunter Biden (pictured) is being attack by the Trump campaign and a number of Republicans over claims that he profited from a Ukrainian gas company and his father used his influence to have a Ukrainian prosecutor fired\n\nJust moments after the rally began, Trump's campaign manager, Brad Pascale, shared a tweet advertising new 'Where's Hunter?' t-shirts\n\nPascale said: 'Get your Where\u2019s Hunter t-shirt NOW! Made in USA (not Ukraine or China). No Prior Experience Required.'\n\nOn the Shop DonaldJTrump website, the product is being sold for surprising $25 a pop despite it only being a simple black t-shirt with two white words.\n\nIn the websites description, the Trump campaign doesn't hold their punches and mocks Biden's alleged mishaps.\n\n'First he was fired by the Navy. Then, he made MILLIONS of dollars from overseas companies while his father was Vice President. Now, he's nowhere to be found! WHERE IS HUNTER BIDEN?,' it reads.\n\nAlthough Trump has disassociated with certain business ventures during his time as president, he's kept his arguably shrewd eye for business for his campaign marketing merchandise.\n\nThe t-shirts description blasts Hunter for allegedly being 'fired' by the navy' and making 'millions' while Joe Biden was Vice President\n\nHunter Biden (far right) pictured with his father in 2018 golfing in the Hamptons with Devon Archer (far left), a board member on a Ukrainian gas company\n\nIt began during his 2016 election run with 'Make America Great Again' ball cap, which reportedly brought in $45 million in revenue, and has emerged into a full out campaign gift shop.\n\nHis supporters can pick from Trump-Pence red solo cups, patriotic drink koozies, signature pens and a host of self promoting items.\n\nSome of the store's most recent items include a superhero themed President Trump fine art poster for $24 and a $45 Keep America Great Pumpkin Hat for the fall season.\n\nThe Trump campaign's push against the Biden clan has appeared to focus on allegations that Hunter profited from work with a Ukrainian gas company and his father, Joe Biden, used his influence to fire a Ukrainian prosecutor to benefit said company.\n\nIn the wake of the recent allegations, the youngest Biden son has seemingly disappeared from the spotlight as his dad tours the U.S.\n\nThe evidence confirming these claims have not been provided and remains uncertain.", "description": "President Trump's campaign has released new t-shirts mocking Hunter Biden with the phrase 'Where's Biden' after his Thursday night campaign rally in Minneapolis, Minnesota", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/04/19570742-0-image-a-99_1570766266460.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
