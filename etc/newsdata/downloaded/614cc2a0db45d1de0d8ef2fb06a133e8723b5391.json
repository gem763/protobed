(AP) - Vic Fangio has settled on the right mix to restore Denver\u2019s defensive dominance even without pass rusher Bradley Chubb and cornerback Bryce Callahan.\n\nThe Broncos (2-4) collected seven sacks and three takeaways for the first time since 1984 in their 16-0 win over Tennessee on Sunday, putting them in prime position to get back into the AFC West race Thursday night when they host the Kansas City Chiefs (4-2) and their ailing quarterback Patrick Mahomes.\n\nThat seemed far-fetched two weeks ago when the Chiefs were rolling and the Broncos were reeling. The franchises\u2019 fortunes have flipped with KC losing twice at home and Denver ending four-game skids at home and on the road.\n\nPlugging in players at all three levels is what helped Fangio get his first wins.\n\nUp front, he put Mike Purcell at nose tackle and moved Shelby Harris to defensive end. He inserted inside linebacker Alexander Johnson into the lineup and he\u2019s collected 19 tackles, 1\u00bd sacks, two QB hits and a forced fumble in his first two NFL starts.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 biggest bugaboo has been their secondary because Callahan, who signed a three-year, $21 million deal in free agency to follow Fangio to Denver, reinjured his surgically repaired foot in July and hasn\u2019t played since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating for everybody, including him,\u201d general manager John Elway said, adding he was unsure \u201cif he\u2019ll be able to get back this year or not.\u201d\n\nFortunately for Fangio, tone-setter Kareem Jackson is back from a sore hamstring and giving CB Davontae Harris his first NFL start Sunday was a spectacular success. Along with Chris Harris Jr. and Justin Simmons, Jackson played all 70 snaps.\n\nThe Broncos claimed him off waivers from Cincinnati on Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that saying? One man\u2019s trash is another man\u2019s treasure. You know, he didn\u2019t make Cincinnati\u2019s squad, so we\u2019re glad to have him,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nIt was the secondary\u2019s sound play that Fangio credited with allowing Von Miller, DeMarcus Walker, Derek Wolfe, Shelby Harris and Johnson to get in on the sack party Sunday.\n\nAccordingly, it was the pass pressure that helped produce the trio of takeaways .\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited in where we\u2019re at,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe fought adversity in the beginning of the year and it\u2019s not like our first few losses were blowouts. We had a chance in every single loss. We knew that we were capable and we just had to keep working.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nWalker had his first career multiple-sack game Sunday with a pair of takedowns on inside rushes, giving him a team-leading three sacks overall. \u201cI was picked two for a reason,\u201d said Walker, who had one sack in each of his first two seasons and is finally showing everyone why Elway selected the former Florida State star and rare inside pass rusher in the second round of the 2017 NFL draft.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe offense. Since scoring TDs on their first two possessions at Los Angeles, the Broncos have reached the end zone just once in their last 22 drives, subtracting kneel-downs. Teams are doubling WR Courtland Sutton in the red zone and nobody\u2019s picked up the slack.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nThe RB tandem of Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman. Lindsay ran for 70 yards and the game\u2019s only TD and Freeman led the team with five catches for 42 yards to go with 34 yards rushing. Lindsay (544) and Freeman (429) are the only pair of running back teammates with at least 400 yards in 2019.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nRG Ronald Leary has surpassed grabby LT Garett Bolles for the team lead in penalties. Leary has two false starts to go with six holding calls - and that doesn\u2019t count his holding back of LG Dalton Risner, already the best O-lineman on the roster, from doing too many interviews lest the rookie get too much pub.\n\nINJURED\n\nUnknown is the status of WR Emmanuel Sanders (knee) and RT Ja\u2019Wuan James (knee).\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n0 points. \u201cShutouts are hard to come by in this league,\u201d Fangio said. \u201cWe need somebody to do an analytics study about how often they do come.\u201d OK, there\u2019s about seven in a season of 256 games, or 2.7% of the time. Intriguingly, Fangio worked 32 seasons as an NFL assistant and his teams posted 14 shutouts in 512 games, exactly the league average.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Broncos need to keep their ground game rolling Thursday night, not only to keep Mahomes & Co. off the field but to capitalize on KC\u2019s biggest weakness . Over their last four games, the Chiefs have allowed an average of 190 yards a game and 4.97 yards a carry. They\u2019ve also allowed eight rushing TDs in those games.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Vic Fangio has settled on the right mix to restore Denver's defensive dominance even without pass rusher Bradley Chubb and cornerback Bryce Callahan.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/titans_broncos_football_43386_c0-110-2632-1645_s1200x700.jpg?36cef401a75a2af50a4619d5bcfd5634ea447bd1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
