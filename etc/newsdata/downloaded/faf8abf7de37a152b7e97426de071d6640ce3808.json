And it sounds like this would not have happened if humans weren\u2019t cruel idiots.\n\nCaspar, the camel, lives at the Tiger Truck Stop in Grosse Tete, about 30km outside of New Orleans, which has a petting zoo that reportedly also contains a baby kangaroo, a coati and miniature horse. According to the Advocate, for years the truck stop has faced criticism from animal rights activists over a tiger that the owners held in captivity at the location until it died last year. The truck stop does not hide how it feels about these advocates \u2014 its Facebook banner shows an image of a tiger licking its lips next to the phrase, \u201cAnimal activists taste like chicken!\u201d\n\nAccording to the Advocate, the ball-biting incident began last Wednesday when the woman\u2019s husband threw dog treats into Caspar\u2019s living space. The couple\u2019s dog went inside the fence. Then the couple, who were not identified, crawled under a strand of barbed wire. The man reportedly pushed Caspar and swatted its hat at the camel. The camel proceeded to sit on the woman.\n\nThen she reacted by biting Caspar\u2019s testicles.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I bit his balls to get him off of me, I bit his testicles to get him off of me,\u2019\u201d Iberville Parish Deputy Louis Hamilton Jr. told the Advocate, following an investigation that reportedly found the woman and her husband had provoked Caspar.\n\n\u201cThe camel did nothing wrong,\u201d Hamilton told the newspaper \u201cThey were aggressive. The camel was just doing its normal routine.\u201d\n\nAuthorities didn\u2019t deem the truck stop at fault because signs warned visitors to stay out of the camel\u2019s enclosure.\n\n\u201cThe camel has never been aggressive, the camel has never gotten out, never caused any issues,\u201d Hamilton told the Advocate. \u201cMy only question to her husband was: \u2018Why did you throw the doggy treat under the fence?... And he just said, \u2018I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u2019\u201d", "description": "If you had asked me yesterday if there is a circumstance in which you should bite a camel\u2019s testicles, I would have said, \u201cNo, there is absolutely no reason anyone should ever bite a camel\u2019s testicles.\u201d Today, I\u2019ve learned that indeed, there might be a good reason for just such an act....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Robb Holland"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/v4ufpscva30encanekb9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
