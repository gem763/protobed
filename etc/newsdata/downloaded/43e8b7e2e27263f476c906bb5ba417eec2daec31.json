Raddon, from Southampton, had his right foot amputated. Both men were in a stable condition in a hospital in the mainland city of Mackay on Wednesday.\n\nBilly Ludvigsson and Emma Andersson, an ambulance nurse and emergency response nurse respectively, were on the day cruise vessel where the men were loaded after the attack.\n\nAndersson told a news conference in Cannonvale that they helped the man who was loaded on first, but his injury was less severe. The couple then made a makeshift tourniquet to stop the life-threatening bleeding of the man who lost his foot and were successful after a few minutes.\n\n\u201cInjury-wise, we have seen worse obviously, but it\u2019s different when it\u2019s a shark attack and we\u2019ve been in the water at the same time. It\u2019s more personal like that,\u201d Ludvigsson said.\n\nThe CQ Rescue helicopter service reported on Twitter that the men had been \u201cwrestling and thrashing about in the water\u201d before the attack occurred.\n\nThe tourist boat brought the men back to the Abell Point marina at Airlie Beach, where they were treated before being flown to by helicopter.\n\nMaggs and Raddon released a statement thanking everyone involved in their care, from the people on the boat to the ambulance, the helicopter service and Mackay Base hospital staff.\n\n\u201cEveryone dealt with our situation well and remained calm and we are very grateful for your help,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThanks also to friends and family back home for your messages of love and support. We are very grateful to everyone supporting us wherever you are.\u201d\n\nMaggs was pictured smiling on Tuesday while being loaded into a rescue helicopter.\n\nJamie Dart, owner of JD Plumbing and Heating Ltd and Maggs\u2019s former manager, had previously told the Guardian that both men were extremely lucky that two trained medical staff who happened to be onboard the cruise boat as guests were there to help.\n\nTracey Eastwick, a Queensland ambulance service manager, said it was fortunate there was a trained paramedic onboard the cruise because \u201cany first aid in those sort of circumstances with those injuries would be extremely important\u201d.", "description": "Billy Ludvigsson and Emma Andersson were on boat that rescued Britons Danny Maggs and Alistair Raddon", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a6a4f1a9f8a968881019e009a400685e3f5a728/0_100_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=684b5e88d400c8b3dd690c1d78fcc2c6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
