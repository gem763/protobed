He didn\u2019t disclose the driver\u2019s his name, but said he\u2019s from California. The agency has not yet interviewed him.\n\nThe driver is U.S. citizen and he didn\u2019t appear to be intoxicated, the Utah Highway Patrol said previously.\n\nThe NTSB is also researching the bus company\u2019s inspection history, hiring practices and corporate safety culture, Kotowski said. The company, called America Shengjia Inc., based in Ontario, California, is cooperating with investigators, he said.\n\nHe said it had been in business for a \u201cshort period of time,\u201d but didn\u2019t say exactly how long.\n\nMultiple phone messages left with the company Saturday and Sunday by The Associated Press were not returned.\n\nThe cause of the Friday crash near Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah has yet to be determined, Kotowski said. They\u2019re examining the crash scene as well as the mid-sized 2017 bus.\n\nUtah Highway Patrol officials previously said it appeared the driver swerved and overcorrected, sending the bus rolling over into a guardrail near a highway rest stop a few miles from the national park. The crash left the top of a white bus smashed in and one side peeling away as the vehicle came to rest mostly off the side of the road against a sign for restrooms.\n\nFour people died and five others were in critical condition as of Saturday night. Hospital officials didn\u2019t provide condition updates Sunday.\n\nThe bus had seat belts, but it\u2019s unknown if any passengers were wearing them, Kotowski said. Utah Highway Patrol Sgt. Nick Street said previously not everyone was wearing a seatbelt, as is common in tour buses.\n\nThree women and one man died in the crash. The victims have been identified as Ling Geng, 68, Xiuyun Chen, 67, Zhang Caiyu, 62, and Zhongliang Qiu, 65, according to the Utah Highway Patrol.\n\nThe deceased were part of a group made up of 29 tourists and one leader. They come from Shanghai and the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, according to a news report on the media website huanqiu.com. The tour leader came from Hebei Province, near Beijing, according to the Zhejiang Online news site. The tour group was dispatching employees from China to help those injured.\n\nAll 31 people on board were hurt. Twelve to 15 on board were considered to be in critical condition shortly after the crash, but several of them have since improved, Street said.\n\nThe Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism urged the travel agency, Shanghai Zhuyuan International Travel Agency, to spare no effort in rescuing the injured and properly handle the follow-up matters.\n\nPhone calls to the travel agency rang unanswered Sunday morning. Lu Yong, the travel agency\u2019s general manager, told a Chinese TV program that the agency\u2019s American partners sent 10 staff members to hospitals to help the victims communicate with doctors and police.\n\nThe News Perspective program, part of the Shanghai Media Group, said in an article on its official social media account that seven relatives of the victims were expected to leave for the United States on Monday or Tuesday with travel agency staff and officials from the culture and tourism bureau.\n\nThe news program\u2019s social media post included photos of parts of the itinerary, indicating the accident occurred on the seventh day of a 16-day trip and also included visits to Yellowstone National Park, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. They were to fly to the East Coast after the western U.S. stops.\n\nMillions of people visit Utah\u2019s five national parks every year. More than half of visitors from China travel on tour buses, said Vicki Varela, managing director of Utah Office of Tourism.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Morgan Smith, news assistant Henry Hou in Beijing and researcher Si Chen in Shanghai contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The driver of a tour bus that crashed near a national park in Utah, killing four Chinese tourists and injuring dozens more, was making his first trip for a company that only been in business for a short time, investigators said Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/aptopix_tour_bus_crash_bryce_canyon_10721_c0-100-2400-1499_s1770x1032.jpg?c570a5b2757182622f78ee702b43ab425751dd7b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
