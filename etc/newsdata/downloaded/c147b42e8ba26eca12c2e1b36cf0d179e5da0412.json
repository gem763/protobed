Police, who described Davis as an innocent bystander, believe multiple suspects fired semi-automatic handguns indiscriminately outside an apartment complex.\n\nWhile the Liberals say they're exploring the idea of a handgun ban, Conservative candidate Tom Dingwall said that it wouldn't solve the problem.\n\nWe're being very ineffective at preventing crime because we are understaffed we are underfunded. - Conservative candidate Tom Dingwall\n\n\"The real issue is illegal guns coming across the border. It's gang violence. It's violent crime and it's [an] inability of our current government to address those issues,\" said Dingwall, who is running in the riding of Ajax. He is currently on leave from the Durham Regional Police Service while he campaigns.\n\n\"Having a handgun ban will not prevent guns from coming across the border. These people are already breaking the law,\" he said.\n\nHe told Lynch that the Conservatives would provide the necessary funding \"to our police agencies so that they can be proactive in investigating and preventing crime, rather than being very good report takers, which we have right now.\"\n\n\"We're showing up after the fact and we're taking reports. We're being very ineffective at preventing crime because we are understaffed we are underfunded.\"\n\nNDP candidate Andrew Cash agreed that border control officers need \"the best resources to stem the flow of illegal firearms.\" He said an NDP government would provide \"better technology, more officers \u2014 whatever we need.\"\n\nWe need long-term, focused, systemic change. - NDP candidate Andrew Cash\n\nCash, a candidate in the Toronto riding of Davenport, told Lynch that \"we need to listen to the communities that are suffering from this scourge of gun violence.\"\n\n\"More often than not they are talking about the lack of affordable housing, the lack of access to programming for their youth, the lack of decent jobs,\" he said.\n\n\"We need long-term, focused, systemic change.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
