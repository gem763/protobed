But I found myself in you.\u201d\n\nHaggerty then proposed to Burnett in a televised Bachelor in Paradise after-show. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do this life with anyone but you,\u201d she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe engagement capped off a Bachelor in Paradise season that has been praised for its handling of a same-sex storyline in a show where, historically, the couples have all been straight. GLAAD Head of Talent Anthony Ramos said in a statement in August that the show\u2019s including Burnett\u2019s coming out story and her journey toward accepting her queer identity has been \u201cgroundbreaking for the series.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Burnett, who was a breakout character on the 23rd season of The Bachelor, which aired earlier this year, came back to the franchise for a stint in Paradise. During the season, she at first pursued a relationship with a male contestant, Derek Peth, but later confessed in a one-on-one interview that she still had feelings for Haggerty \u2014 the two had dated before Bachelor in Paradise taped.\n\nThe show ended up flying out Haggerty (who had not previously appeared on The Bachelor) and she surprised Burnett in an Aug. 20 episode. Over the course of the remainder of the show, Burnett was able to explore and further accept her sexuality, and she came out as sexually fluid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s okay to be myself and embrace that and own it,\u201d Burnett told People in an interview. \u201cI want to be honest and open. Love is love.\u201d\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Demi Burnett and Kristian Haggerty got engaged on the finale of Bachelor in Paradise in a \"groundbreaking\" moment for ABC's reality show", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/bachelor-in-paradise-demi-kristian.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C67px%2C3000px%2C1571px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
