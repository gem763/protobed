REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nRoads near the stadium were blocked off and those attending the exhibition game had to go through two rounds of security checks. Tickets sold for as high as 18,888 yuan ($2,650).\n\nSeveral street vendors were selling Chinese national flags outside the arena and some people had called online on those going to the game to carry flags in a show of force.\n\nThe now-deleted tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey supporting anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has sparked a furore in China\uff0cwith a fan event canceled and Chinese partners cutting ties with the National Basketball Association (NBA).\n\nSome people protested outside the stadium against Morey and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who has spoken out in support of Morey.\n\nOne such protester, who declined to be named, was holding up a small sign with expletives directed at Morey and Silver.\n\n\u201cThere are no Lakers or Nets fans tonight. We are all Chinese basketball fans,\u201d the protester said.\n\nNO SHOW\n\nNBA events scheduled on Tuesday and Wednesday were canceled and Chinese sponsors and partners have suspended or severed ties with the league.\n\nState broadcaster CCTV and Tencent (0700.HK) will not show Thursday\u2019s game or the rematch scheduled for Saturday in Shenzhen on their platforms, underscoring the severity of the fallout.\n\nThe NBA said in an email on Thursday that players and personnel would not be made available to the media. The league had scheduled a briefing before and after the game, and Silver had been expected to address the media.\n\nThe Hong Kong protests began in opposition to a bill allowing extradition to mainland China but have since evolved into broader calls for democracy. China has accused the West of stirring up anti-Beijing sentiment in Hong Kong, and Chinese state media has characterized Morey\u2019s tweet as the latest example of meddling in China\u2019s own affairs.\n\nSilver spoke out in support of Morey\u2019s freedom of expression on Tuesday, further angering Beijing. The NBA\u2019s business in China, which took years to cultivate and is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion, is under immense pressure.\n\nThe NBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Saturday\u2019s Lakers-Nets game would take place.\n\nROCKETS GOODS DISAPPEAR\n\nHouston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike (NKE.N) and NBA stores in major Chinese cities, with the franchise\u2019s direct association with Morey making it a central target of the furore. Managers at some of the Nike stores said they had been instructed to remove the goods via an internal memo from management.\n\nA specialist NBA store at a major shopping center in Shanghai removed all Rockets merchandise, as did the basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centres in Beijing and Shanghai.\n\n\u201cRockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,\u201d the colours of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.\n\nNike and the NBA did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment.\n\nOther major Chinese retailers, including Alibaba (BABA.N) and JD.com (JD.O), also pulled Rockets merchandise off their various platforms. Alibaba and JD.com declined to comment.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nChinese state and party-backed media continued to publish items critical of the NBA. The official English China Daily published an editorial cartoon on Thursday playing on the NBA\u2019s official logo of an athlete dribbling a basketball. The cartoon instead put a bomb labeled \u201cpolitics\u201d in the athlete\u2019s hand, leaving the basketball fallen by the wayside.\n\nU.S. sports broadcaster ESPN was also criticized for its coverage of the row after using a map that appeared to endorse Beijing\u2019s claims to both self-ruled Taiwan and disputed territories in the South China Sea.", "description": "Hundreds of Chinese basketball fans waved national flags in a Shanghai arena on Thursday ahead of an NBA game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets amid a huge backlash against a tweet backing anti-China protests in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Se Young Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439146766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990CG", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
