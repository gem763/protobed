Why would she go and have surgery on her face like we wouldn\u2019t know? How could she do that? She doesn\u2019t look like herself, and you can\u2019t just do that, where you go and you just don\u2019t look like yourself because we expect you to look like yourself.'\u201d\n\nZellweger said she sat quietly while they talked and went to leave the train car when it came to her stop, at which point the man who had been mocking her realized who she was. \u201cThe man is still talking about how stupid I am and he looked up and he said, \u2018Oh God, you\u2019re not, you are, you\u2019re oh my God, but you look just like yourself,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s funny how that works isn\u2019t it?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Wow, oh, well you know Hugh Grant.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I do know Hugh Grant, he\u2019s a great guy. I\u2019ll tell him you said hello.'\u201d\n\nThe actress, who is already earning Oscar buzz for her portrayal of legendary entertainer Judy Garland in Judy, said it\u2019s moments like that that would get to her. \u201cIt\u2019s only momentarily where you go, \u2018Jeez, wow, that\u2019s pretty painful.\u2019 But then I don\u2019t live in that. It just visits my life a little bit here and there,\u201d she noted. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not really privy to that stuff until someone sends it to me and comments and says, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe they said this or this happened.\u2019 I\u2019m not aware of it because I don\u2019t seek it out and I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\nZellweger\u2019s turn in Judy comes as part of what Cagle has dubbed a \u201cRen\u00e9e-ssance\u201d alongside her role in Netflix\u2019s What/If. The buzzy roles come on the heels of a six-year absence from Hollywood that lasted from 2010-16, barring that 2014 appearance at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards that sparked the furor over her changed appearance, which prompted her to make a statement to PEOPLE.\n\nFor Zellweger, that time away was invaluable to the work she\u2019s doing now. \u201cI\u2019m a storyteller and we draw from personal experience, and I was regurgitating the same old information,\u201d she told Cagle. \u201cI just felt like a phony because I was drawing on nothing. I felt like I need to stop. I forgot to consider myself in the equation of professional responsibilities\u2026I was stuck at 23 or 24, whatever it was.\u201d\n\nNow, Zellweger feels a renewed sense of purpose in her career \u2014 one fans can witness in Judy when it hits theaters Sept. 27.\n\nThe Jess Cagle Show premieres Sept. 16 on SiriusXM, and Zellweger\u2019s interview will air as part of it Sept. 20.\n\nRelated content:", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger opens up about 'painful' comments about her appearance after her return to Hollywood", "authors": ["Maureen Lee Lenker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ORt5UVwya9dbsSEdk3sKFw--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/4833303ef41742678de97f54b9da9bc4", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
