After wrapping up their royal tour of Africa, Prince Harry dropped a massive bomb on British media because of their malicious treatment of his wife, Meghan Markle. On Tuesday, Harry released an incendiary letter announcing that he will be taking legal action against the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday\u2019s publishers, Associated Newspapers, for publishing a private letter of the Sussexes and using it to paint Meghan in a bad light.\n\nHarry\u2019s mainly argued that the lawsuit is for Meghan\u2019s protection, because he doesn\u2019t want Meghan to continue being dehumanized and commodified like his late mother, Princess Diana, was. But despite his heartbreaking plea, it\u2019s looking like releasing the letter was a poor decision on Harry\u2019s part. According to The Times, royal aides told him not to drop the letter so soon after their Africa tour, but Harry dropped the letter anyway.\n\nHarry\u2019s advisors \u201cwarned that it would inevitably push the tour itself off the news agenda\u201d and thought that his timing was \u201cunfortunate.\u201d And if that wasn\u2019t already bad enough, Harry and Meghan\u2019s secretaries had zero input into the letter\u2019s writing before he published it.\n\nRight now, many people in the UK are frowning at Harry\u2019s decision to publish the letter, including royal biographer, Penny Juror. \u201cI can\u2019t think the queen would approve of that statement. I don\u2019t think the Prince of Wales would ever put a statement out like that, and, my goodness, over the years he\u2019s had cause when the media have been attacking him or Camilla,\u201d she told Newsweek. \u201cI don\u2019t think even his brother would have advised putting out a statement like that.\u201d This checks out because The Times alleged that the queen and the Cambridges were unaware of the statement\u2019s existence in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s all looking pretty messy right now for Harry, but the important thing here is that he\u2019s making a power move in defense of his wife. It\u2019s respectable, regardless of his rebel agenda!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "The royal aides think the timing of the letter was \u201cunfortunate.\u201d", "authors": ["Starr Bowenbank"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KdUhqqA_.mo6qxWGRVvrqw--~B/aD04MTM7dz0xNjI2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/faef79bd193d56c3db8fa91620724b61", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
