Want chicken? He can grill chicken breasts or wings, and he\u2019ll even make chicken burgers. He taught himself one summer in college.\n\nSides range from mac and cheese and mashed potatoes to green beans and broccoli. And often when Elliott cooks, he makes enough to feed himself and rookie running backs Tony Pollard and Mike Weber. Elliott began inviting them over for barbecue after Dallas drafted each last spring. The first invite surprised Pollard.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that from a guy like him, being who he is,\u201d Pollard told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like he had an ego.\u201d\n\nSome players in the situation might have. Speculation about the Cowboys\u2019 future at running back swirled when the Cowboys drafted not one but two backs despite suiting up the rushing titleholder. Was there truth to rumors Elliott wanted an extension with two years left on his deal? Did Dallas seek a reliable back to spell Elliott after he racked up a league-high 381 touches in 2018? Or did first-year offensive coordinator Kellen Moore envision a tandem like the Saints\u2019 previous duo of Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram?\n\nAll three turned out true.\n\nElliott ignored the noise, dismissed the sense that young backs would pose a threat, and took Pollard and Weber under his wing, he says.\n\n\u201cJust to help them grow as players,\u201d Elliott told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cMy job as a leader is make sure they\u2019re prepared for when they\u2019re in there. Let\u2019s say something happens to me: I owe it to this team to make sure they\u2019re as prepared as I can.\u201d\n\nSeven games into the season, Cowboys coaches and players say Elliott has.\n\nNFL trade deadline:Five teams that should be buyers and five that should be sellers\n\nNFL trade deadline:Seven deals that teams should make\n\nWeek 8 picks:Do Patriots, 49ers remain unbeaten?\n\n\u2018Be aware of a bunch of guys\u2019\n\nElliott first invited Pollard and Weber over during offseason activities in May. Weber and Elliott were friends as teammates at Ohio State in 2015. Pollard and Elliott first connected after the draft, when the veteran messaged the fourth-round pick on Instagram.\n\n\u201cHe was actually the first one to reach out,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cJust saying congratulations, he was glad to have me as part of the team and just be ready to work.\u201d\n\nFrom organized team activities and minicamp, the trio did. Elliott still sits between Pollard and Weber in meetings to explain schemes to them. They follow his lead in individual drill reps and pick his brain in broader installations. Leading up to training camp, they visited Elliott and his three dogs at home. They\u2019d carve out about 30 minutes a visit to review the playbook.\n\nIf the linebacker does A, you do B. If the linebacker does C, you do D.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll just throw out different scenarios because you get a lot of different looks in the game,\u201d Weber said. \u201cSo he\u2019d throw every look he has experienced and basically show us so when we go out there, we know what to expect also.\u201d\n\nInto the season, that relationship has continued.\n\nThe trio no longer break down film together at home, spending enough hours in position and offensive meetings at the Star to game prep. Visits to Elliott\u2019s home are instead now time to decompress\u2014watch movies, laugh and joke, and tease Weber for how strikingly they think he resembles one of Elliott\u2019s dogs, Jack Jack.\n\nBut in meetings, walkthroughs and practice, Elliott lets younger backs know: Here\u2019s the ideal cut when the tackles block on a certain play. Here\u2019s how this opponent\u2019s linebackers tend to attack. Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins is stacking the box and edging closer to the line of scrimmage? Be ready to protect because \u201cmore than likely,\u201d Pollard learned from Elliott, \u201che\u2019ll be blitzing.\u201d\n\nThe result: The Cowboys are averaging 146 rushing yards per game (up from 122.7 last year) and during four games have averaged at least 5.3 yards per carry. Against the Eagles last Sunday, they ripped off 189 on a defense that entered the contest allowing 73.2 per game. Elliott led the way with 111 yards on 22 carries, but Pollard pitched in 28 yards on eight carries, including a slashing 11-yarder that teammates initially thought was over in the backfield. Quarterback Dak Prescott pitched in 30 yards and a score on six carries, while Tavon Austin juked an Eagles corner out of his job\u2014Orlando Scandrick was cut by the team a day later\u2014on his sole rush for a 20-yard score.\n\nEach ball carrier contributed important yards to march down the field. But the collection of rushers also left Philly\u2019s D guessing who would threaten next.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be aware of a bunch of guys on the field,\u201d right guard Zack Martin said. \u201cNot just 21 (Elliott).\u201d\n\nUp 14-7 in the second quarter, the Cowboys demanded that. Prescott faked a handoff to Elliott on fourth-and-1 before leveraging each of their running threats to elude defenders on a 9-yard pass to Elliott in the flat. The next two plays: Pollard clawed for 11 yards on a run, then Prescott gained 7. Three plays, three different playmakers, each wearing out a defense en route to Dallas\u2019 third touchdown of the half.\n\n\u201cI like to look at the defense as like a shield,\u201d Elliott said in the aftermath of the 37-10 win. \u201cIn the first quarter, you hit \u2018em a couple of times, you\u2019re going to dent the shield, you\u2019re going to make it splinter a little bit. But you know, if you keep hitting it, little pieces will keep breaking off, and eventually it\u2019s going to break.\u201d\n\nSpelling Zeke\n\nThe Cowboys hope that using Pollard will prevent Elliott from breaking down as fast.\n\nNo doubt, Moore says, Elliott will remain the centerpiece, just as his six-year, $90 million extension suggests. Through seven games, Elliott has rushed for 602 yards and six scores on 135 carries in addition to catching 24 balls for 176 more yards. During Dallas\u2019 three-game skid, when the team repeatedly fell behind, Pollard was used sparingly. But in four wins, he\u2019s contributed 16 to 23 offensive snaps a contest, even joining Elliott over 100 yards against the Dolphins. (Weber is a practice-squad member.)\n\nThe result: Elliott feels comfortable resting for a series or two a game in hopes of staying fresher in the third and fourth quarters. Even more importantly to a Cowboys team that believes it has the talent to contend, Elliott anticipates feeling fresher into December and January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season,\u201d he told USA TODAY Sports during the bye week. \u201cI feel how my body felt last year when I had all those carries. If I can spell myself now so later on in the season I feel more fresh and ready to play, it\u2019s for the better of the team.\u201d\n\nSo, too, Elliott believes, are the consistent invitations he gives Pollard and Weber to come over.\n\n\u201cThe better relationships you have,\u201d Elliott said, \u201cthe better we can work together and the better we can become as players.\u201d\n\nElliott's grilling, however, might not need improvement. So far, the rookie backs are impressed. Weber insists Elliott is \u201cactually really good at barbecuing.\u201d Pollard, whose parents own a barbecue joint in Memphis, says Elliott is \u201cpretty good,\u201d even by his family\u2019s high standards.\n\n\u201cI like the chicken,\u201d Pollard added. \u201cI think the chicken, we could put that in the restaurant.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good cook.\u201d\n\nFollow Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.", "description": "Ezekiel Elliott is cooking up big plans for the Dallas Cowboys as he takes the team's young running backs under his wing this season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/24/USAT/4e95db43-044d-4eae-9650-71bb84a4caa3-USATSI_13405746.jpg?crop=5183,2915,x0,y361&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
