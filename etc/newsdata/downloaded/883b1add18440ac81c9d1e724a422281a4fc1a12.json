Cory Booker and it will quickly become apparent that he has family in nearly every politically important state for a presidential candidate. His mother lives in Nevada. There\u2019s the uncle from North Carolina, and a cousin in Florida.\n\nIn Iowa, the most important state to Booker\u2019s campaign, it\u2019s a little different: More than 80 family members live in the Des Moines area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a very intimidating front row here,\u201d Booker said on Tuesday at a rally in West Des Moines. About a dozen cousins sat a few feet from him, clad in campaign gear. One of them, Marv Allen, rose to ask a question, though he didn\u2019t quite hold his cousin\u2019s feet to the fire.\n\nAs the residents of Iowa prepare for an autumnal deluge of out-of-state presidential aspirants chomping pork tenderloin sandwiches and touring farms to claim a slice of the Hawkeye spirit, the senator from New Jersey can, through his relatives, come as close as any candidate in recent memory to an enviable distinction: local.\n\nHis many Iowan relatives, who span the political spectrum but have all pledged to support him, give Booker a unique network of organizational support in the essential early state.\n\nEarly on in the primary calendar, with high expectations and a two-decade political career that observers have long viewed as destined for a run for the presidency, Booker attracted key Iowa political operatives and quickly hired 50 paid staff members in the state.\n\nSince then, his campaign has basically flatlined, regularly polling just above the margin of error and rarely experiencing the surges of small-dollar donations that drive growth. (One exception: when Booker\u2019s campaign said it would fold without pulling in an extra $1.7 million by the end of the last quarter. It succeeded.)\n\nBetter-funded campaigns, like those of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have now passed his in numbers of paid staff members in Iowa. (Booker\u2019s Iowa staff members are particularly dedicated, though; multiple organizers have gotten tattoos of the campaign slogan \u201cWe Rise,\u201d written in Booker\u2019s handwriting.)\n\nSo, as his candidacy hinges on a top showing in Iowa, Booker\u2019s relatives have doubled as super supporters. They have hit phone banks and lobbied their friends for donations, shown up in great numbers at state Democratic Party events and frequented the Urbandale field office.\n\n\u201cWe go there weekly,\u201d said Lori Young, a cousin who works as a community organizer in the area.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ll often run into each other at events,\u201d said another cousin, Lizz Sharpe.\n\n\u201cWell, Lizz is the one who is on top of everything, notifying everyone in the family anytime something is going on,\u201d said Paula Morris, the daughter-in-law of Booker\u2019s Aunt Alma. \u201cShe\u2019s got the phone chain.\u201d\n\nFor nearly a century, the Booker clan in the Des Moines area answered to Aunt Alma. She was the unquestioned matriarch, and a big supporter of Booker, hosting him and dozens of cousins during his first swing through the state as a presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI still remember one of my favorite times, when my Aunt Alma came out wearing her crown at a big Black Caucus event,\u201d Booker said in an interview. \u201cWhen I stood there speaking to everybody, having my family there in the front row, it really made me feel like I was at home.\u201d\n\nAunt Alma died this summer, at age 100, but Sharpe and the rest of the cousins have continued the effort.\n\n\u201cWhen we buried my Aunt Alma, and the family was all in a small black church, it\u2019s special,\u201d Booker said, adding that it was \u201cspiritually uplifting\u201d to be surrounded by so many relatives.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t deny that I have an incredible amount of committed people to caucus for me right off the bat, and their circle of friends, and they\u2019ve been just great spokespeople for me for really my entire career,\u201d he said.\n\nSharpe recalled Booker\u2019s visit more than 20 years ago to his Aunt Shirley\u2019s house in West Des Moines, when he first told his grandparents and Iowa cousins about his plan to run for Newark City Council.\n\n\u201cThey were just stunned,\u201d Sharpe said. \u201cAnd I remember I ran back to the bedroom, got my purse, and I grabbed $50. And I came back and I said, \u2018I want to be the first one to donate to your campaign.\u2019 And just as soon as I said that, the grandparents and everybody just came alive. And they were like, \u2018Oh yes, we\u2019ll donate too!\u2019\u201d", "description": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa -- Travel with Sen.
