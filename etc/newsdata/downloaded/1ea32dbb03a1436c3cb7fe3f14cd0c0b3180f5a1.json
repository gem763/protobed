Steve King drinks water from toilet-fountain at detention center", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cI took a drink out of there,\u201d King told the small crowd that had gathered at his town hall in Eagle Grove, Iowa. The water was \u201cactually pretty good,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI smacked my lips.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t actually toilet water. As King went on to explain, some detention center cells have an unusual setup where a sink doubling as a water fountain is attached to a toilet. Though it might not look appetizing, the water that comes from the sink isn\u2019t coming from the toilet, making it theoretically safe to drink.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not drinking out of the toilet,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s drinking out of the water fountain that\u2019s integral with the back of the toilet.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s remarks, which were first reported by NBC News, resurfaced a months-old debate about conditions in Border Patrol stations near the U.S.-Mexico border. In July, amid reports that migrant children separated from their parents were living in squalor and developing preventable illnesses, Democratic lawmakers toured two Texas facilities and expressed serious concerns about the \u201cappalling and disgusting\u201d conditions they witnessed. One report, in particular, prompted a strong visceral response: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter that migrant women were being held in cells without water and that Border Patrol agents had told them to drink out of the toilets instead.\n\nOfficials have repeatedly denied that claim, which was also made by several other Democratic lawmakers, and in King\u2019s recent remarks, he suggested that had been a misunderstanding caused by the fact that the water fountain was attached to the toilet.\n\n\u201cI think there was a little language barrier there and so that\u2019s how come we got that misinformation,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter NBC reporter Maura Barrett shared a transcript of King\u2019s remarks on Twitter, the congressman responded with a video that shows him bending over to drink from the hybrid toilet fountain. While it\u2019s hard to see if he actually smacks his lips, he does let out a sigh of satisfaction, smiling and declaring the water to be \u201cnot bad.\u201d In his tweet, King accused Ocasio-Cortez of being dishonest, suggesting that the video debunked what he described as her \u201c#FakeNews spin about the border.\u201d\n\nHello Maura: Thank you for covering my town hall, attended by 103 people, in Eagle Grove today. I hope you will include this video in NBC\u2019s coverage. No way was @AOC objectively honest in her #FakeNews spin about the border. Click bait for Snowflakes! https://t.co/2mWRoxv1uW pic.twitter.com/B0kD3N5Vmj \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) September 4, 2019\n\nBut King didn\u2019t address the freshman congresswoman\u2019s claims that the water fountain wasn\u2019t working in the cell that she visited, and that Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) was unable to turn on the sink\u2019s faucets. The migrant women, lacking any other source of water, \u201cwere told they could drink out of the bowl\u201d instead, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in July. She later reiterated those claims at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the New York Democrat responded to King\u2019s video, writing on Twitter that he and other Republicans who filmed themselves drinking out of the toilet-adjacent sinks \u201cclearly didn\u2019t read sworn testimony that detention sinks were broken.\u201d She added: \u201cThey\u2019re so anti-immigrant they risk pink eye to show off that they didn\u2019t do the reading.\u201d\n\nEven when the combination toilet fountains, which are also sometimes found in jails and prisons, work as intended, advocates contend they\u2019re still not an ideal solution. Most people don\u2019t want to drink water while standing over an open toilet, and those trying to use the bathroom are left with no privacy. In July, when the issue first came up, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, an immigration attorney and policy analyst at the American Immigration Council, shared photos of the combination toilet-sinks on Twitter, and asked his followers if they would be willing to drink from them. Many were not.\n\nAs you can see, there is virtually no privacy for people held in CBP cells. Imagine being in one of these cells for weeks, overcrowded, forced to use an open toilet like this with dozens of people nearby and that toilet also being the only source of drinking water! pic.twitter.com/0VvhAnSl2N \u2014 Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@ReichlinMelnick) July 1, 2019\n\nBut King was willing to give it a shot. So was Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.), who posted a video similar to King\u2019s in late July, claiming that Ocasio-Cortez and other freshman congresswomen had \u201cdeliberately misled the American people.\u201d\n\n.@AOC and the Squad deliberately misled the American people by claiming that detainees are \u201cdrinking from toilets.\u201d\n\n\n\nMigrants have potable water, have shelter, and are being fed.\n\n\n\nThe constant attacks against our brave border patrol agents must stop! pic.twitter.com/lxTIZTnenH \u2014 Rep. Jody Hice (@CongressmanHice) July 29, 2019\n\nWhile it\u2019s not every day that a sitting member of Congress litigates the precise definition of \u201ctoilet water,\u201d King\u2019s remarks about detention centers were relatively mild compared to many offensive comments he\u2019s made in the past. In August, he was widely criticized for claiming that the human race might no longer exist if it weren\u2019t for rape and incest. Earlier this year, he was censured by his colleagues after he was quoted questioning how the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d had become offensive, and responded by comparing himself to Jesus.", "description": "The controversial congressman raised more than a few eyebrows on Wednesday when he told constituents about his tour of a migrant detention facility where people in custody were allegedly told to drink from toilets.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HG3HJFGF44I6TC7XZXRNTYEQKU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
