The Warriors are not the concern in the least. They'd have a long way to go to get him to Golden State, they'd have to give away a lot. He has never given any indication that he wants to leave Milwaukee. So a lot of that stuff, it is more chatter than anything.\"\n\nThe \"chatter\" got a lot louder Tuesday when ESPN's Ramona Shelburne reported the Dubs are \"a big threat\" to sign Antetokounmpo once he enters free agency.\n\nNow, wanting to sign the 2019 NBA MVP is understandable, but it would take some pretty heavy roster and cap gymnastics on the Warriors' part. Golden State currently has four players signed to max contracts -- Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and D'Angelo Russell -- and none of their contracts will be up by the time Antetokounmpo becomes a free agent in 2021.\n\nIn order to pay Giannis the massive amount he'll demand, the Dubs would have to trade Thompson and one of Green or Russell in order to get under the tax to offer the $35-$40 million per season it will require to land Antetokounmpo.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot impossible, but it seems unlikely at this point.\n\n[RELATED: Steph fires back at KD after criticism of Dubs' offense]\n\nWith Kawhi Leonard leaving the Eastern Conference, the Bucks are in prime position to make a run at the NBA Finals and further nudge their star in the direction of signing the supermax extension with them.\n\nThe Bucks are in the driver's season, but you never can count out the Warriors.\n\nNBA Rumors: 'Fighting' Warriors for Giannis Antetokounmpo not Bucks' focus originally appeared on NBC Sports Bay Area", "description": "Are the Warriors a threat to sign Giannis in 2021?
