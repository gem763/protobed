He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree at Presidency College in Kolkata, a master\u2019s in economics from JNU, and PhD from Harvard University.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Banerjee has remained a staunch critic of the Narendra Modi government, its policies and the way they have been implemented.\n\nThis makes him the prime candidate for the \u201canti-national\u201d tag open-handedly handed out by war-mongering supporters of the government.\n\nDon't Miss 863 SHARES 555 SHARES 824 SHARES 1.9 K SHARES\n\nThe Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is a straightforward censurer of government\u2019s policies.\n\nHe criticised demonetisation in November 2016 that wiped off nearly 90 per cent of the country\u2019s cash out of circulation.\n\n\u201cI never understood the logic behind it. For one, why introduce Rs 2,000 notes? And I suspect the pain is much greater than is being currently anticipated,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nDemonetisation was a fictional masterstroke by prime minister Narendra Modi who anticipated that the move will lead to the demise of black money and corruption.\n\nIn 2018, close to two years after demonetisation, when the Reserve Bank of India finished counting the money that was returned to the central bank after the Modi government\u2019s decision to demonetise, the results were nothing short of outrageous.\n\nA total of 99.3 per cent of the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were returned to banking system, officially stating that demonetisation was nothing but a monumental failure.\n\nIn yet another \u201canti-national\u201d act, Banerjee, an otherwise supporter of the Good and Services Act (GST), criticised its haphazard implementation.\n\nAFP\n\nIn December 2018, he flayed government for appointing retired bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das as the next RBI Governor, and warned that the decision leaves a lot of \u201cfrightening\u201d questions about governance issues at key public institutions. MA in History, Shaktikanta Das is first non-economist in 28 years to be RBI Governor.\n\nBanerjee suggested an impartial person, preferably someone from outside, should be assigned the task of going through the changes and confirming if it meets the best accepted practices.\n\nThe development economist, In March 2019, expressed concerns over \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in influencing statistical data by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. He was one of the 108 economists and social scientists who called for the restoration of \u201cinstitutional independence\u201d and integrity to the statistical organisations.\n\nHe has been a staunch supporter of politics based on economic interests \u201cbecause those are aspects that we can deliver on without creating social divisions.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Banerjee spoke in response to noted economist and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, as part of the OP Jindal Lectures at Brown University in the United States.\n\nHe put together a few prescriptions for what the Indian economy needs right now. The last item on the list? \u201cPray.\u201d On the next list, for the longer run? \u201cPray more.\u201d\n\nThis is what he prescribed:\n\nHe also played a pivotal role in devising the minimum income guarantee plan, NYAY, as a major poll plank in the run up to the 2019 general election in India.\n\nAlso, Banerjee even did time at Delhi\u2019s Tihar jail during his JNU days in the 1980s when the Congress government was in power. He told a daily, \u201cWe were beaten (I was) and thrown into Tihar jail, charged not quite with sedition, but attempt to murder and the rest. The charges were eventually dropped\u2014thank god\u2014but not before we spent ten days or so in Tihar.\u201d\n\nRight after winning the Nobel, Banerjee, on October 14, insisted that the Indian economy is \"doing very badly\" and going into a tailspin even as the government is increasingly recognising that there is a problem.\n\n\"The economy is doing very badly in my view,\" he told a press conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nClearly, with all his credentials and vehement disparagement of Modi government, Banerjee makes for a perfect choice for hate driven by jingoism.", "description": "Indian-American Abhijit Banerjee, who won Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, is everything obverse of what the current prime minister Narendra Modi-led ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its followers believe in.For one, he is a Jawaharlal Nehru University alumni.", "authors": ["Shweta Sengar"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/why_nobel_laureate_abhijit_banerjee_became_a_target_of_hate_trolls__called_antinational_1571129567_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
