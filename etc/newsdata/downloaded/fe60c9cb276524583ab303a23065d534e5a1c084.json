As we traveled around, local Chinese greeters proudly pointed out the contrasting vistas: rugged empty hills in North Korea and isolated clusters of Soviet-era buildings in Russia, whereas in China, commerce and construction abounded between booming border towns. In one such town, Hunchun, population 250,000, regional officials asked me if I planned to write anything. Perhaps something cultural, I suggested. I hoped for a window onto Chinese life in this far-flung zone.\n\nThe next night they laid on a manifestly ready-made, two-hour pageant of old Manchu ethnographic music and dance, with fluttering feather fans and colorful costumes. I explained to my conscientious hosts that I had hoped for something more contemporary\u2014perhaps portraying current life on the frontier, something about real people and ideas. My request engendered a lot of brow-furrowing discomfort. I had asked for the one thing that their country\u2019s authoritarian system has found it almost impossible to deliver at any level: a vibrant popular culture.\n\nChina has become globally competitive in many fields with blinding speed, from the economy and military to science, medicine, sports and even in cultural areas such as cuisine, classical music and contemporary art. But it can\u2019t seem to compete with the West in crucial mainstream genres such as movies, popular music, fashion, novels and the like. I say \u201ccrucial\u201d because, without universalizing its culture at a popular level, China cannot ultimately sell a lifestyle for the world to emulate, a set of aspirations that people elsewhere might embrace. Nor can it make its engagement with other cultures more palatable, less like an intrusion by outsiders.\n\nThe country\u2019s elites are focused on how China can improve its image and cultural influence abroad, enhancing its soft power and mitigating to some degree negative political news like the recent events in Hong Kong. At a 2014 party summit, Xi Jinping famously announced, \u201cWe should increase China\u2019s soft power, give a good Chinese narrative and better communicate China\u2019s messages to the world.\u201d And there\u2019s the rub. Arguably, Mr. Xi\u2019s approach guarantees its own failure by assuming that cultural influence is something that can be instituted by directive, like a Stalin-era five-year plan.\n\n\u201c Lives lived in freer conditions, depicted with relative frankness, are simply more compelling, more dramatically believable. \u201d\n\n\u201cThe West was able to eclipse its darker history abroad with its popular culture\u2014a process that Chinese leaders studied very deliberately in recent years,\u201d says Jing Tsu, professor of modern Chinese studies at Yale University. \u201cBut it\u2019s not clear if they\u2019re willing to risk it. That kind of expression starts at home from the bottom up, and Chinese history is full of cases where mass movements become destabilizing.\u201d\n\nOne could argue that Western influence became so ubiquitous not just because of wealth and power but because of free expression among the populace, which allowed the portrayal of characters with universal predicaments of the kind that leap cultural boundaries. The absence of propagandistic intent made it more compelling and authentic. Lives lived in freer conditions, depicted with relative frankness, are simply more compelling, more dramatically believable. A vibrant culture ultimately sells itself. Even when the West was economically stagnant in the 1970s, rock music conquered the world.\n\nAi Weiwei, the renowned dissident artist, says that China \u201calways had an elite culture, which never encouraged public involvement, just as you see in their politics. In contrast, Hollywood and pop music are manifestations of the middle class.\u201d He argues that China\u2019s one-party, top-down approach means that it \u201cwill never export its culture as a natural fruit of its society.\u201d\n\n\u201cNatural\u201d is a useful distinction here because Western culture\u2014especially American culture\u2014celebrates natural expression, being oneself, authentic feeling. That ethos has set the tone for the world, but it is not a comfortable default mode for an authoritarian system. Cultures dominated by central planning are inevitably unsettled by mass entertainment whose DNA is furnished by individualism and transparency.\n\nChina certainly has a vast entertainment industry, albeit a constrained one these days. Just 20 years ago, the country\u2019s cinemas numbered in the hundreds; today there are some 60,000\u2014about 20,000 more than in the U.S. The top box-office movie to date, 2017\u2019s state-funded blockbuster \u201cWolf Warrior 2,\u201d made $874 million domestically. Despite being financed by the military, it is a genuinely rip-roaring, nail-biting Chinese Rambo story set in Africa\u2014with an American as the villain, of course.\n\nWhen you have a domestic market that size, with all the machinery and talent in place, the foreign markets should soon follow. But it hasn\u2019t worked out that way. The giant Dalian Wanda Group built China\u2019s biggest studios and looked set to create a domestic industry to rival Hollywood while also forming partnerships with Sony and AMC cinemas stateside. It seemed to be perfect positioning to export Chinese soft power on a mass scale. But in 2017, Beijing called in Wanda\u2019s loans from state banks on suspicion that it and other film companies had deliberately overpaid for foreign properties as a ruse to expatriate capital.\n\n\u201c The state discourages the familiar rewards of stardom in the West. \u201d\n\nThis year, authorities prevented most Chinese movies from showing at festivals abroad, because in 2018 at Taiwan\u2019s prestigious Golden Horse Film Festival for Chinese-language productions, a documentary award winner extolled Taiwanese independence. Mainland luminaries in attendance got texts ordering them to show no emotion, avoid the parties and return home at once.\n\nThough China allows a movie-star celebrity system to exist with huge financial benefits, none of the talent live flashy, extravagant public lives. Nose rings and tattoos are frowned on. The state discourages the familiar rewards of stardom in the West, where fame and wealth translate into more personal freedom and abundant opportunities to live large.\n\nWho, continents away, is going to aspire to the lifestyle of China\u2019s quietly compliant celebrities? That\u2019s especially true if the authorities can eclipse them at will, as happened to Fan Bingbing, who was China\u2019s top actress until she disappeared last year for several months under house arrest, accused of hiding her true income and fined $70 million.\n\nA cultural genre that the Chinese execute with great success on the global stage is the grand music and dance pageant. The productions are all about coordination, discipline, unity and apolitical spectacle\u2014perfectly capturing China\u2019s current national priorities. Jay Scheib, a successful theater director whose rock opera \u201cBat Out of Hell\u201d is currently running in New York, advised on a pageant in Ningbo, China, with 50 cast members. He says that he never heard artsy disputes over interpretation, truth-telling or artistic feeling: \u201cThey did exactly what you told them but got expressive only over contract details.\u201d\n\nOne definition of exporting real culture might be a population talking fearlessly about itself to itself, and letting others listen in. Clearly China is not poised to take that route to soft power. But maybe it doesn\u2019t have to. Ai Weiwei believes that, despite Beijing\u2019s crackdown on investing in Hollywood, Chinese money will ultimately return. And as he notes, \u201cEvery big Hollywood film\u2019s ultimate goal these days is to access China\u2019s giant market. So lots of [American] film studios are now altering their language and participating in self-censorship.\u201d\n\nAdd to this influence the inroads that Beijing is making into 5G and cellphone markets and you have a worrisome future where China\u2019s soft power resides not in creating its own exportable content but in shaping ours\u2014and in controlling the mediums by which we convey culture to each other.\n\n\u2014Mr. Kaylan, a journalist in New York, has written about international politics and culture for The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and Forbes.", "description": "Beijing is eager to exert cultural influence, but only a free society, in open conversation with itself, can create global aspirations.", "authors": ["Melik Kaylan"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-EW864_CHINA_SOC_20190904175853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
