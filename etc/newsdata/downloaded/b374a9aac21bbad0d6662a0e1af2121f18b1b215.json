We tried something to be more solid without the ball and that did not happen. We were poorer using the ball in the first half.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the players, there are players who are not playing well for their clubs. That is the situation we are in. But we collectively have to accept the result but as manager I have to accept it.\n\n\"Collectively we have to accept there were not enough good performances. We tried to change the shape which was not working. Our performance was not good enough, it's as simple as that. The goals we conceded were typical of the chances we gave away.\n\n\u201cWe have to respond in the right way, we have a couple of days to prepare and we have to reward our supporters with a better performance. There were not many positives. We accept defeat, and accept we have to be better than we were.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nHarry Kane, who gave England an early lead with a fifth minute penalty, added: \"I think it was down to us.\n\nWe were sloppy with the ball, we didn't move it as quickly as we normally do.\n\n\"Every away game in Europe is difficult. They had the crowd behind them, sometimes the pitch is not as easy to play, but that's no excuse. It's a bit of a wake up call but we're in a good position.\n\n\"There's still stuff to work on for sure. We gave the ball away too cheaply and we'll have to go away and look at it. There's no need to panic and we'll go again on Monday.\"", "description": "Despite taking the lead through Harry Kane's penalty England slumped to a 2-1 loss in Prague and missed the opportunity to confirm Euro 2020 qualification", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20563554.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Czech-Republic-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
