We are closely monitoring the situation and aim to continue to provide a stable service\".\n\nPollution could become a source of political tension in Vietnam, where protests against the degradation of the environment have occurred in recent years.\n\nAir pollution in Hanoi and other major cities in the Southeast Asian country has hit hazardous levels recently, with the government's Environment Administration last week warning people to limit outdoor activity.\n\nThe criticism of AirVisual snowballed after Vietnamese Facebook user Vu Khac Ngoc, an online chemistry teacher with almost 350,000 followers on the site, said in a post that AirVisual was manipulating its data to sell air purifiers made by its parent company, IQair.\n\nAirVisual rejected the accusation saying it was recognised all over the world for publishing unbiased air quality data.\n\nNgoc offered no evidence for his assertion, which he said could harm tourism to Vietnam, and on Wednesday issued an apology to the app's developers.\n\n\"I regret that the negative reviews of AirVisual have affected and hindered the operation of the app in Vietnam,\" Ngoc said.\n\nAirVisual said its ranking of 90 cities was \"live\", updated several times an hour.\n\n\"Therefore, when a city tops the list this is not to say that city has the worst air quality in the world ever, but rather the worst air quality at that moment in time of the 90 ranked cities,\" the spokesman said.
