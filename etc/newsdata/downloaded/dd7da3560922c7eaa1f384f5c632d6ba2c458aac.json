(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a series of legal maneuvers that have defied Congress, drawn rebukes from federal judges and tested the country\u2019s foundational system of checks and balances, President Trump has made an expansive declaration of presidential immunity that would essentially place him beyond the reach of the law.\n\nBoth in courts and before Congress, Trump\u2019s legal teams are simultaneously arguing that the president can\u2019t be investigated or indicted by prosecutors because Congress has the sole responsibility for holding presidents accountable, and that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is an unconstitutional effort that the White House can ignore.\n\n\u201cWe have a president who simply doesn\u2019t believe that Congress is a coequal branch of government,\u201d said Elliot Williams, who helped run the Justice Department\u2019s legislative affairs office during the Obama administration. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge departure from anything we\u2019ve seen in our lifetimes.\u201d\n\nThe broad legal effort escalated on Tuesday when the White House counsel sent a letter to House Democratic leaders dismissing Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry as \u201cillegitimate\u201d and stating that the entire executive branch would refuse to cooperate with it.\n\nFor a president who has responded to investigations into his conduct with claims of \u201cwitch hunt!\u201d and \u201cpresidential harassment,\u201d the latest machinations underscore how Trump\u2019s White House and private legal teams as well as \u2014 to a lesser degree \u2014 the Justice Department have come to agree with his absolutist view of executive power.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution has a supremacy clause for a reason,\u201d said Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s private lawyer. \u201cIt has separation of powers for a reason. And it defines the president in a unique constitutional capacity \u2014 and that is as commander in chief and as chief executive. And it requires a unique set of both obligations and constitutional privileges.\u201d\n\n[The latest on the impeachment inquiry into President Trump]\n\nIn his eight-page letter to Congress on Tuesday, White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone declared that \u201cthe President has a country to lead,\u201d and claimed that Congress\u2019s attempts at oversight were overly partisan, lacked due process and ran afoul of constitutional principles. Echoing Trump, Cipollone made several political points in his letter, accusing Democrats of trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nCiting executive privilege, the Trump administration has blocked several officials from testifying before Congress or handing over documents in recent months. In a dramatic move Tuesday, the White House blocked House investigators from deposing Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, just hours before he was set to testify as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused his office by pushing Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nTrump\u2019s private lawyers are also defending him in multiple court cases by pointing to executive privilege, making the case that Trump\u2019s position affords him special protections.\n\nThe White House has argued Trump can refuse to cooperate with Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry because the House has not held a full vote authorizing the probe and that the Trump administration has not been given due process.\n\nThe White House would not commit to cooperating with Congress even if the House holds a full vote to open an impeachment inquiry, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy.\n\nResponding to the White House letter Tuesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the House would proceed with its investigation and consider any efforts to impede it as obstruction.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are not above the law,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cYou will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nSeveral legal scholars panned Cipollone\u2019s letter as a political document with little legal relevance.\n\nMichael J. Gerhardt, a University of North Carolina law professor, said the White House letter amounted to \u201ca bunch of political talking points\u201d with a \u201ccompletely backwards\u201d interpretation of the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution gives the House the \u201csole power of impeachment\u201d and does not prescribe how the process should unfold, said Gerhardt, author of \u201cImpeachment: What Everyone Needs Know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t get to dictate to the House how it should do its job,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an attempt to flout the law and place the president above the law.\u201d\n\nIlya Somin, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, joked in a Facebook post that the Trump administration\u2019s legal reasoning made him wonder \u201cwhether the White House counsel was sick the day they taught law at law school.\u201d\n\nSomin also rejected the assertion from the White House that the inquiry violates \u201cconstitutionally mandated due process.\u201d An impeachment inquiry, he said in an interview, is not a criminal trial.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is losing a position of power,\u201d Somin said. \u201cNone of the rights the White House demands\u201d are required by the Constitution.\n\nBut Trump has long held an expansive view of executive power and has cited Article II of the Constitution, which defines the powers of the executive branch, as a catchall that gives him wide latitude.\n\n\u201cArticle II allows me to do whatever I want,\u201d Trump said in a June interview with ABC News.\n\nThe Justice Department has previously taken the position that sitting presidents cannot be criminally charged, a position that former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III said limited his options as he probed Trump\u2019s conduct during a lengthy investigation.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s original team of private lawyers encouraged him to cooperate with the investigation and many of his aides met with Mueller\u2019s team, Trump never sat for an interview and the results of the investigation seem to have emboldened him to take a hard-line approach to any investigations or court cases.\n\nTrump\u2019s private lawyers have taken an expansive view of presidential immunity in a series of lawsuits seeking to fend off subpoenas for his tax returns and financial records from congressional committees and state officials.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump\u2019s private attorneys argued in court that the president is immune from criminal investigation \u2014 not just by federal prosecutors, but also local prosecutors. In two other cases seeking to block congressional investigations into his finances, Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued that Congress should not investigate the president\u2019s conduct, claiming that it is a job for prosecutors.\n\nJudges in all three cases have rejected the president\u2019s sweeping arguments as out of step with history and the Constitution. Trump\u2019s appeals of those rulings, which could eventually land at the Supreme Court, are still pending.\n\nA federal judge in New York this week called Trump\u2019s claims of immunity \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d The judge denied the president\u2019s request to block the Manhattan district attorney from accessing his Trump\u2019s tax returns. \u201cThe Court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the President above the law with the text of the Constitution, the historical record, the relevant case law\u201d or any other authority, wrote U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero.\n\nIn an earlier ruling in Washington, issued before the start of the House impeachment inquiry, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta refused to stop a House subpoena for Trump\u2019s accounting firm records.\n\n\u201cIt is simply not fathomable,\u201d the judge wrote, \u201cthat a Constitution that grants Congress the power to remove a President for reasons including criminal behavior would deny Congress the power to investigate him for unlawful conduct \u2014 past or present \u2014 even without formally opening an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell said in her courtroom Tuesday after a Justice Department lawyer argued that court rulings in 1974 allowing Congress to review materials from the Watergate grand jury should be viewed as invalid today.\n\nThe Justice Department said that the court should deny a House Judiciary Committee request for grand-jury materials from Mueller\u2019s investigation, despite the legal precedent set during the impeachment inquiry into President Richard M. Nixon.\n\n\u201cAs I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case,\u201d Howell said.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s legal teams have pressed ahead on multiple fronts, seeking to withhold from Congress and local prosecutors the president\u2019s tax returns, financial records and administration officials whose testimony could embarrass the administration.\n\nBy defying the impeachment inquiry, Trump has essentially set off a constitutional power struggle between the legislative and the executive branches.\n\nThe courts may ultimately have to decide, said Paul McNulty, who was chief counsel and communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans during the 1998 impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to checks and balances and the powers of the two branches, it\u2019s like a game of rock, paper, scissors \u2014 everything seems to have another thing that could check it,\u201d said McNulty, now the president of Grove City College in Pennsylvania.\n\nWilliams said Trump\u2019s arguments amount to a claim of legal immunity that defies the intent of the Constitution and its authors.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the case that getting elected president is an automatic shield from any scrutiny, for even personal misconduct, be it criminal or civil,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that were truly the case, then he really could go out and shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not face any consequences.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s latest legal machinations highlight his absolutist view of executive power and presidential impunity.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Ann E.
