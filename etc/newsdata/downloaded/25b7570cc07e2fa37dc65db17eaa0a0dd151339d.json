Happy infrastructure week! Sign up and tell your friends. Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and President Donald Trump seen here last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Investigations\n\nWILL HE STAY OR WILL HE GO \u2026 RUN FOR SENATE?: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is now officially a key player in Ukrainegate \u2014 and he is quickly proving himself as one of President Trump's most loyal foot soldiers.\n\nPompeo has admitted he was also on the phone call in which Trump pressed Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate a 2020 political rival. He's refused lawmakers' demands for State officials to appear this week for depositions for the impeachment inquiry, accusing Democrats of \u201cbullying\u201d his department's employees. And he's generally adopting Trump's scorched-earth approach.\n\nBut Republicans told Power Up that Pompeo's heightened role in the biggest challenge of Trump's presidency could actually help the top diplomat in his own political ambitions.\n\nTop Republicans have been urging the former Kansas congressman to throw his hat in the ring for an open Senate seat. And many watching that race said Pompeo's profile in the red state could not be higher than as the president's wingman and defender.\n\n\u201cI don't see this as a political liability in Kansas \u2014 this is nonsense and I think most Kansas Republicans would agree with that, \u201d a longtime Kansas Republican political consultant told Power Up.\n\n\u201d a longtime Kansas Republican political consultant told Power Up. If anything, the imbroglio is a chance for Pompeo to prove his loyalty to Trump: \u201cIt would hurt him politically if he abandoned the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would hurt him politically if he abandoned the president.\u201d Some key Kansans said Pompeo has already risen to the occasion by working to discredit the impeachment investigation: \u201cI hope he runs \u2014 he is very important to the U.S. right now,\u201d Alan Cobb, the president and CEO of the Kansas U.S. Chamber of Commerce who is also weighing a Senate bid, told Power Up.\n\nThe political backdrop: A Democrat hasn't been elected to represent Kansas in the Senate since 1930. But Republicans have expressed concern that former Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach (R) is likely to win the primary. The controversial hard-liner and Trump ally was beat out by Democrat Laura Kelly in the gubernatorial race last year, giving the left hope that they'll be able to beat Kobach a second time around.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he'd \u201clike to see the secretary of state run for the Senate in Kansas \u201d just one day after Kobach announced in July: \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that [Pompeo's] my first choice,\u201d McConnell reiterated last month.\n\n\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that [Pompeo's] my first choice,\u201d McConnell reiterated last month. But Pompeo has demurred when asked whether he'd do it. He told the Wichita Eagle's Jonathan Shorman that he'll remain at the State Department \u201cas long as President Trump will give me this incredible privilege.\u201d\n\nThose who are pulling for Pompeo to jump in say he can wait until 2020 to make a decision on whether to run \u2014 and that it would actually be politically wise to spend the next few months putting up a big public push to defend Trump as much as possible.\n\nAlready, Pompeo's get-tough approach with Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who has become the public face of Democrats' impeachment inquiry, has earned plaudits from the big boss. \u201cAdam B. Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump took issue with Schiff criticizing Pompeo and suggesting the secretary of state might interfere with witnesses in the impeachment inquiry: \u201cThat guy couldn\u2019t carry his blank strap,\u201d Trump said of Schiff. (As our colleagues reported, \u201cTrump said he was trying to sanitize a common phrase about carrying a jock strap.\u201d)\n\nCounterpoint: Some Democrats working on Senate races said Pompeo's role in the impeachment inquiry is a serious political risk \u2014 especially in a state like Kansas that might be up for grabs.\n\nPotential attack lines: \u201cI think that not just for [Pompeo] but for many Republicans on the ballot, the question is: Are you standing up for basic information?\u201d a Democratic aide working on Senate races told Power Up. \u201cAnd if you're not willing to find out the facts because you're worried about upsetting the president or protecting your political interests, that is not what is right and not what is patriotic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that not just for [Pompeo] but for many Republicans on the ballot, the question is: Are you standing up for basic information?\u201d a Democratic aide working on Senate races told Power Up. \u201cAnd if you're not willing to find out the facts because you're worried about upsetting the president or protecting your political interests, that is not what is right and not what is patriotic.\u201d The impeachment inquiry may not move some Republicans regardless of the findings, the source acknowledged, but predicted that a blind fealty to Trump might repel swing voters: \u201cThe problem for Republicans \u2014 considering how independent and swing voters fell in 2018 --- is that [loyalty] is not enough for them.\u201d\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, Pompeo's own legal exposure won't really be affected if he leaves his current role, according to John Bies, the chief counsel at a liberal watchdog group American Oversight who served in the Department of Justice during the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cCongress can still subpoena him when he's off in Kansas,\u201d Bies told Power Up.\n\nBies told Power Up. Pompeo could, however, cede raw political power if the inquiry is still ongoing and he leaves his perch at State. Running for office, Bies said, \u201ccould affect the political calculus over what to claim privilege over \u2014 and if he is not at the State Department anymore, he wont be involved in making recommendations to the White House.\u201d\n\nChatter: Of course, there's always the possibility that Pompeo \u2014 known for his political ambition \u2014 opts not to stay in the bull's eye of the fight between the executive branch and Congress for too long.\n\nChairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) accused Pompeo of obstruction in a statement this week: \u201cThe committee may infer that he is trying to cover up illicit activity and misconduct, including by the president.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe likes to be close to the center but you get burned in the center. Maybe he bails out and runs for Senate \u2026 He's all about himself,\u201d said a Republican operative who works on national races.\n\nTHE ONE WHO GOT AWAY: \"Pompeo\u2019s recently departed special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, is scheduled to meet with congressional investigators behind closed doors on Thursday. It remains unclear whether a transcript of the interview will be made public,\" our colleagues John Hudson and John Wagner report.\n\n\ud83d\udc40: \"In advance of the appearance, Volker has turned over a number of documents to congressional staffers consisting of text messages with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and other people, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.\"\n\n\"In advance of the appearance, Volker has turned over a number of documents to congressional staffers consisting of text messages with Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W.

Trump dodged the question repeatedly. Instead he offered without evidence that former vice president Joe \"Biden and his son are stone-cold crooked.\"\n\nTrump engages in contentious back and forth with @JeffMason1 after he dodges Ukraine question:\n\n\n\nTrump: We have the president of Finland, ask him a question.\n\n\n\nMason: I have one for him, I just wanted to follow up on the one I asked you\u2014\n\n\n\nTrump: Did you hear me?

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) 'helped write' the whistleblower's complaint: \"Well, I think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before. I\u2019d go a step further: I think he\u2019s probably helped write it. Okay? That\u2019s what the word is,\u201d Trump said. (He was responding to a New York Times report that the whistleblower met with a member of Schiff's staff before coming forward. Nowhere is there any evidence that Schiff helped \"write\u201d the complaint in any way, and the lawmaker's team has denied that.)\n\n\"Well, I think it\u2019s a scandal that he knew before.

I\u2019m used to it. For me, it\u2019s like putting on a suit in the morning.\u201d This is why the president said the U.S. actually held up aid to Ukraine: \"Because I don\u2019t like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years.\"\n\n\"Because I don\u2019t like being the sucker country.

The aid the Trump administration slow walked had already been approved by Congress and was to help the country fight back against Moscow-backed forces that invaded Crimea in 2014.\n\nIt wasn't just the press conference: Trump also flew off the handle on Twitter as well, tweeting a Nickelback video, an EXPLETIVE and other attacks on Democrats and Joe Biden:\n\nThe Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country, not wasting everyone\u2019s time and energy on BULLSHIT, which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016, 223-306.

O'Rourke has reconfigured his campaign around gun violence after a mass shooting in his hometown of El Paso. One of the key planks of his gun policies is a mandatory buyback of certain semiautomatic firearms.\n\n\u201cI was really offended by those comments, and I think he represents a kind of politics that is focused on poll testing and focus group driving and triangulating and listening to consultants before you arrive at a position,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters later.\n\nBooker subtly digs Biden on licensing: \u201cYou should not be a nominee from our party that can seriously stand in front of urban places and say, \u2018I will protect you,\u2019 if you don\u2019t believe in gun licensing,\u201d Booker said. Biden released his gun plan just before the forum. It does not include a nationwide licensing requirement.\n\nBooker also not so subtly attacks Beto: \u201cBeto O\u2019Rourke was not for gun licensing, criticized me when I came out for it,\u201d Booker said.\n\n\u201cHe saw the horrors visiting his community.
