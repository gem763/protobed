Callers get a chance at asking Jim Cramer what he thinks about particular stocks. One caller Thursday night asked about Anthem (ANTM) : \"Everyone hates this one, but I like it,\" said Cramer.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of ANTM, below, we can see that prices have been holding around or just above the April low. The lagging moving averages are still bearish with the slopes of both the 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving both bearish.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has declined from the middle of July but it is still above its April low.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been improving in recent weeks and signals another cover shorts buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of ANTM, below, we can see that prices are holding around the $240 area which is a zone that has acted as support a number of times. The 40-week moving average line is declining and the weekly OBV line shows a mild decline the past three months or so.\n\nIn the lower panel is the slow stochastic indicator. The stochastic indicator is one of many overbought/oversold tools and this indicator is down in oversold territory. Being oversold is not exactly a buy signal as a stock can continue to decline and get more oversold. Being oversold can mean a stock will be more prone to rally when the news flow shifts or is fully discounted.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of ANTM, below, we can see that ANTM has reached a downside price target of $248. Again, this is not necessarily a buy signal but it can mean that bearish traders are more likely to be covering shorts.\n\nBottom line strategy: Aggressive traders could consider the long side of ANTM at current levels if they can afford to risk a close below $230.", "description": "Let's check out the charts and indicators of this unloved stock....ANTM", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Oversold Anthem Could Rally Here So Go Long With A Risk Level In Mind", "Let'S Check Out The Charts", "Indicators Of This Unloved Stock.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Mark Sebastian", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Helene Meisler"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/8b5d9c18-5ea6-11e8-8b44-cfe603f6ca8e.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
