I really struggled with that early on,\" Murray said. \"I was mistiming the ball. I felt quite slow on the court, and he was pretty much dictating all of the points. I managed kind of early on in the second set to start putting a bit more on my ball, going for my shots a little bit more.\"\n\n'Much improved' in past 2 weeks\n\nMurray is now 5-6 on tour since returning to action after his successful hip surgery. He won his first singles match at a tour-level event two weeks ago at Zhuhai, China, then made it to the China Open quarterfinals in Beijing last week.\n\n\"These last few weeks I have played more matches,\" Murray said. \"It's starting to get a little bit more used to starting to compete at this level again.\n\n\"I think each week I have been feeling good, better. In the beginning I didn't necessarily feel good.
