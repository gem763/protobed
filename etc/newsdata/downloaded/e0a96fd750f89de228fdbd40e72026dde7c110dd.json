This change in stance sparked a tirade of criticism from environmental conservation groups abroad. But rather than helping the cause, it may have made things worse as some have dismissed these claims as a form of cultural imperialism.\n\nThe issue of whaling in Japan has been fraught with controversy for years, even when Japan was a member of the IWC. Much of the friction arose due to Japan\u2019s whaling for questionably \u201cscientific\u201d purposes\u2014which is allowed under the IWC\u2014in the Antarctic Ocean and Southern Hemisphere, and as a result, often getting called out by animal protection groups.\n\nHowever, under Japan\u2019s new commercial whaling policy, the country will concentrate on whaling minke and other whales off its own coast and leave their previous hunting grounds in international waters alone.\n\nFeeble curiosity in Japan\n\nLocal reactions were largely unaffected at first, with the general sentiment being mild support and mostly curiosity about what whale even tastes like.\n\nDespite what the whaling interests would have you believe, whale meat is actually quite rare in Japan. During the U.S. occupation following World War II, American authorities encouraged Japan to introduce whale meat into food markets and school lunches as a cheap source of protein. Still, the majority of the younger generation has never tried it.\n\nWhile 233,000 tons of whale meat were consumed in Japan in 1962, that number plummeted to just 3,000 tons by 2016, according to government data reported by The New York Times.\n\nIn response to the new commercial whaling initiative, many Japanese Twitter users took to the platform to voice their curiosity, including user @rQI9ot583PtNqE0:\n\n\u201cIs whale meat even tasty?\u201d they wondered.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @sgkshasaikodaze, wrote, \u201cIf it\u2019s cheap and tastes good, I want to try it.\u201d\n\n\u5b89\u304f\u3066\u7f8e\u5473\u3044\u306a\u3089\u98df\u3079\u3066\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u3041 \u2014 \u3055\u304b\u3058\u3087\u30fc (@sgkshasaikodaze) July 4, 2019\n\nDespite the vague interest surrounding the matter, others are interested in the topic for sociopolitical reasons.\n\nOne Twitter user, @torigoyahime, posted several pictures from the local news along with the comment, \u201cThese pictures are from the local news report on commercial whaling. The interviewee working at the fish marketplace looks so happy! The newscaster is always smiling, but he even made a comment that he is happy this piece of Japan\u2019s food culture is back.\u201d\n\nJust before five ships set sail from Kushiro, Hokkaido on Japan\u2019s first commercial whaling expedition in over 30 years, head of the Japan Small Whaling Association Yoshifumi Kai told AFP, \u201cWe are very excited at the resumption of commercial whaling.\u201d He continued, \u201cMy heart is full of hope.\u201d\n\nWidespread disapproval abroad\n\nFraming this controversy over whaling practices is the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which has brought Japan\u2019s animal rights issues under more scrutiny than ever. Several athletes have already publicly stated their disapproval for the lax rules around animal protection that are currently in place.\n\nGlobal marine conservation NPO Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has repeatedly called Japan out for its whaling practices. They released an official statement on June 1 denouncing Japan\u2019s return to commercial whaling, claiming that Japan is \u201camong these last remaining pirate whaling nations\u201d and that their return to commercial whaling is \u201can arrogant disregard to International Conservation Law.\u201d\n\nThey also posted the following tweet imploring Japan to conform to international law.\n\nIt's time for #Japan to do the right thing and \ud83d\uded1 #whaling. \ud83d\udc0b\u2764\ufe0f First whales caught as Japan resumes commercial hunt after 30 years https://t.co/vPaOF4DJ0n \u2014 Sea Shepherd SSCS (@SeaShepherdSSCS) July 1, 2019\n\nThis sentiment is echoed across the international community, with comments responding to the news including respectful indignation:\n\nHi Japan: With respectfulness, the capture and killing of whales is no longer acceptable given the knowledge we have about our Earth \ud83c\udf0f , its oceans, and the life in it \u2013 and the urgent needs to preserve, conserve, and protect our shared ecosystems. Thank you \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 Greg Cook 2019 (@GregCook2011) July 4, 2019\n\nNo Japan, have a lot of respect for your culture. But this one thing sets you outside acceptable practices of a decent country. \u2014 Derrick Gray (@derrickg745) September 7, 2018\n\nAlong with straight-up righteous anger using the hashtag #BoycottTokyo2020:\n\nI love sports & #rugby as a fan and former player, but I will be boycotting the @rugbyworldcup & #Olympics @Tokyo2020 since I am an even bigger fan of not brutally slaughtering whales, as Japan is now doing. #japan #whaling #whales @Seasaver #BoycottTokyo2020 \u2014 Annkathrin Sharp (@BlueSpaceSeeker) December 29, 2018\n\nCriticism, imperialism, racism?\n\nMany people didn\u2019t take well to these criticisms. Regarding the backlash of international environmental conservationists, Matayuki Komatsu of Japan\u2019s Fisheries Agency said, \u201cNo one has the right to criticize the food culture of another people,\u201d according to an article by Animal Planet.\n\nThere is a history of the Agency taking a hard line on this subject, with another member of the JFA Joji Morishita quoted in a BBC article from 2001 as saying, \u201cSingling out [Japan\u2019s] whaling is cultural imperialism \u2013 some people would say it\u2019s racism. Norway and Iceland are also whalers, but the criticism of Japan is stronger.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IWC, it\u2019s true that Norway and Iceland are still proponents of commercial whaling and actively hunt whales today. It\u2019s Japan\u2019s recent flip-flop on the issue that has made its stance newsworthy on the international stage. The country, therefore, suffers harsher criticisms.\n\nHas this narrative of Japan being singled out on the international stage taken root in the public consciousness? While very few Japanese people were pro-whaling to begin with, the outpouring of criticisms regarding Japan\u2019s new whaling policies could frustrate the general public, as reported by an article in the South China Morning Post.\n\nSo now it seems that Japan has a mix of vague interest and defensiveness regarding the new whaling policy, whereas international environmental groups have adopted a hard line against it.\n\nPerhaps rather than resorting to cancel culture and boycotts, we should have a conversation about the issue and seek a positive conclusion. For now, it looks like things will continue in this current state of mutual animosity.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kelsey Lark", "Erika Van 'T Veld", "Victoria Vlisides", "Gaijinpot Blog"], "top_image": "https://gaijinpot.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/What-do-Japanese-people-think-of-whaling-in-Japan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
