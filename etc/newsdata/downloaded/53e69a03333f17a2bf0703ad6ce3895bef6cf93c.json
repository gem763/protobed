Baylor\u2019s eight-game winning streak is the longest in the conference.\n\n\u201cIt does feel good to know that I was part of the foundation for something new,\u201d said Tecklenburg, a 310-pound senior starting left guard who was about 40 pounds lighter as a redshirt freshman when he was a tight end before the past two seasons as the starting center.\n\n\u201cLooking back at the 1-11 year and just seeing now the progress of how Baylor has changed, the culture has changed, and just how when you buy into a process that it actually works,\u201d said senior linebacker Jordan Williams, his role expanded with a season-ending knee injury last week to leading tackler Clay Johnston, another of the seniors.\n\nTecklenburg, Williams and Johnston are among 10 current seniors who redshirted as true freshmen in 2015, when Baylor was coming off back-to-back Big 12 titles and had its last eight-game winning streak. There is also sixth-year receiver Chris Platt, who played as a redshirt freshman that season and got an extra year of eligibility after a knee injury only four games into the 2017 season.\n\nThey all stayed in the aftermath of a sprawling sexual assault scandal that led to coach Art Briles getting fired before the 2016 season, when the Bears started 6-0 under interim coach Jim Grobe before losing 17 of their next 19 games. There was a six-game losing streak before a Cactus Bowl victory, then 1-11 in Rhule\u2019s debut season.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a special relationship with those guys that were on that 1-11 year,\u201d Tecklenburg said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot, so that was a hard year. Just where we\u2019ve come right now, we want to go a lot further, but it is special to kind of reflect sometimes and know that we\u2019ve built something.\u201d\n\nA 43-point loss at Oklahoma State was the most lopsided in 2017, when only three of the 11 losses were by more than 14 points. That is where the Bears play Saturday after surviving double overtime to beat Texas Tech at home last weekend.\n\n\u201cOur older players went through all of the trials and tribulations and built it the right way, so that they appreciate now when they\u2019re having success what it took to get here,\u201d Rhule said.\n\n\u201cThat year we went 1-11, a lot of those games, they weren\u2019t just blowouts and they weren\u2019t just teams just dominating us physically,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt was just people were older and more experienced than we were.\u201d\n\nThese Bears are far from satisfied only halfway through the regular season. The trip to Stillwater is part of a difficult remaining schedule, including consecutive home games against No. 5 Oklahoma and No. 15 Texas next month.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that we need to get better at. I think since conference play started, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played near our best football,\u201d Tecklenburg said. \u201cAt least we\u2019re getting wins while we\u2019re learning these lessons. It\u2019d be a lot harder if we were losing these games.\u201d\n\nBaylor\u2019s current winning streak began with a win over Texas Tech in the regular season finale last November, and the Bears then beat Vanderbilt in the Texas Bowl.\n\nBoth of their Big 12 home games have come down to the wire. They won 23-21 over Iowa State in their league opener Sept. 28 when John Mayers kicked a 38-yard field goal in the final minute after blowing a 20-0 lead in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI think everyone on the team knows we\u2019re capable of a lot more,\u201d Tecklenburg said. \u201cSo while we are happy after the wins, there is a feeling in the locker room every week of we\u2019ve got to look at this honestly tomorrow and grow. \u2026 A lot of people want to be more than 6-0.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Big and versatile Sam Tecklenburg found it hard to think about when Baylor would be good again while the Bears were losing all those games his sophomore season two years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/baylor_revival_football_27991_c0-367-3883-2632_s1200x700.jpg?bba2632e9401d62090ae2609d450531a32f01be2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
