Elizabeth Warren \u2014 the youngest of the three at 70 \u2014 are pulling nearly three-quarters of the primary electorate\u2019s support in national polling. And even if Sanders stumbles, no younger alternative is likely to benefit.\n\nInstead, it is Sanders\u2019 friend and fellow progressive, Warren, who might be poised to gain.\n\nIf the Vermont senator remains off the campaign \u201cfor any substantial period of time,\u201d said Paul Maslin, a top Democratic pollster, Warren stands to draw from his pool of support, strengthening a candidate who has already surged ahead of Biden, the former vice president, in some polls.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/50/db/581f0d1d4224ac5c5c0f7e7c76f0/age-explainer-thumbnail.png\"\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s truly in a position where he can\u2019t campaign for a while,\u201d Maslin said, \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to move into a situation where we\u2019re going to have a new front-runner, and then everything changes \u2026 I guarantee you she will have all guns aimed at her, and she\u2019s going to get tested, sooner rather than later probably.\u201d\n\nA similar calculation was already making the rounds among Democratic strategists and donors hours after Sanders was hospitalized.\n\nOne Wall Street executive involved in Democratic Party politics said news of Sanders\u2019 hospitalization reverberated at least incrementally in the financial markets. \u201cI think one of the reasons the markets went down today is not only because of the jobs numbers and softness in manufacturing. I think there\u2019s a feeling that this helps Warren.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Democrats tended to reward youth in their presidential nominating contests. And when the party selected Hillary Clinton in 2016, it learned what conservative media could do with a candidate in her late 60s and a case of pneumonia.\n\n\u201cIt actually did work, and it was a Facebook effort to actually target on these particular issues: on sickness, age,\u201d said Amanda Renteria, national political director of Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cWhat\u2019s different this year is the seriousness and the gravity of what\u2019s going on around the world does give, I\u2019ll say, qualifications and experience a different weight than in the past, more than in 2016. And I think that by and large has altered this conversation about age.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Reines, a longtime Clinton confidant said that in the current primary, \u201cDemocrats have been thinking about age, and have not been concerned about it \u2026 It\u2019s not like anyone thinks Biden and Sanders are spring chickens. But that clearly hasn\u2019t been a concern. And it clearly isn\u2019t a problem.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

He'll take a few days to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.\u201d\n\nStill, the episode startled Sanders\u2019 supporters.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s good, except Bernie\u2019s stents,\u201d said Jeff Cohen, co-founder of RootsAction.org, an online activist group that supports Sanders said Wednesday, just after Sanders\u2019 hospitalization was announced.\n\nCohen said he trusts medical professionals' assessment \u201cthat this is not a big thing\u201d and expects him to return to the campaign soon. But if he is sidelined, Cohen said, it could increase pressure on Warren.\n\n\u201cThere are many of us that feel that Bernie is the heat shield \u2014 that Bernie has attracted so much of the negative coverage it has helped Warren,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Bernie in there, Warren would be getting far more negative press \u2026 It would not surprise me if Warren authentically wants Bernie back on the trail soon for that same reason.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Sanders remains on firm ground. On Tuesday, his campaign announced that he had raised more than $25 million in the year\u2019s third quarter, a staggering sum. And advisers to several of his competitors believe Sanders has a floor that won\u2019t not fall below 15 percent even if Warren surges higher.\n\nOne Democratic strategist said that after his hospitalization, \u201cI could imagine his supporters bear-hugging him even harder.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Sanders is that he has been struggling to broaden his support, not energize voters who already favor him. In his effort to \u201cstart showing growth,\u201d the strategist said, his hospitalization \u201ccouldn\u2019t have come at a worse time.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Drudge Report\u2019s all-red headline about Sanders read, \u201cBernie Heart Scare! All Events Canceled.\u201d\n\nRepeatedly this week, Sanders\u2019 competitors said they expected him to be \u201cback to Bernie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assume you\u2019ve heard the news about Bernie \u2014 that he\u2019s had a medical incident, and I know everyone here wishes him well, wants to see him strong and back on the trail as soon as possible,\u201d Warren said at a forum in Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nWhen she was asked at a second event, \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d Warren replied, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be in the fight than on the sidelines.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/08/75/f035d2d845eca4786259aa81a55a/191003-bernie-sanders-getty-773.jpg"}
