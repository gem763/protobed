He has said he can\u2019t release his tax returns because they are under audit, even though there is no rule to prevent him from doing so.\n\nBut the president may soon be forced to give his tax returns to investigators. On October 7, US District Judge Victor Marrero ordered Trump to turn over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors investigating whether he violated state laws by fabricating business records.\n\nDays later, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the president to turn over the past eight years of his tax returns to the House Oversight Committee, saying lawmakers have the right to see the documents.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers have said they will fight both decisions and take them to the Supreme Court if they have to.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nThe floodgates are opening as Trump officials publicly defy his orders and more whistleblowers come out of the shadows\n\n\n\nBut the public may still get a window into the president\u2019s closely held financial documents thanks to an employee at the IRS who recently blew the whistle on \u201cinappropriate efforts to influence\u201d the agency\u2019s audit of Trump\u2019s tax returns.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the person accused of trying to interfere with the audit is a political appointee at the Treasury Department.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many government officials who have access to the president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s tax documents, Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department, told Insider.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s and vice president\u2019s tax returns are kept in a top-secret vault,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cIt\u2019s code-word-protected, the whole nine yards, and not just anyone can get in there. There are very few people \u2013 the head of the Treasury, the head of the IRS \u2013 who have access.\u201d\n\nTrump was also accused of altering his tax and loan records by Michael Cohen, his longtime former lawyer who is serving a three-year federal prison sentence for campaign-finance violations and tax evasion.\n\nIn particular, Cohen accused Trump of inflating and deflating his loan and tax documents, respectively \u2013 an allegation that appears to bear similarities to what ProPublica reported this week.\n\nKevin Riordan, a financing expert and real-estate professor at Montclair State University who reviewed the newly revealed tax records, told ProPublica that \u201cit really feels like there\u2019s two sets of books,\u201d one for lenders and one for tax investigators.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue numbers,\u201d Riordan said. \u201cThat\u2019s black and white.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
