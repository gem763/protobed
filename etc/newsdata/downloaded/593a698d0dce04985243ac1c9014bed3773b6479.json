They also hope that the reclassification of workers as employees could be a prelude to later organizing drives.\n\n\u201cWe think this is really a core fight about what the future of our economy will look like and whether we will be moving forward in a society where new technology won\u2019t be used to degrade people\u2019s standards,\u201d said Larry Engelstein, secretary-treasurer of 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents property service workers.\n\nThe California bill would classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors unless companies show workers have control over the assigned tasks and are doing work outside the usual course of the company\u2019s business.\n\nLegislators exempted numerous industries, including real-estate agents and tutors. The measure was passed by the Assembly and Senate there last week and Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has said he would sign it.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should app-based workers be considered employees of the company? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nRide-hailing drivers in New York City already have greater protections than their peers in California. The city\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission has passed a series of regulations that more tightly control the app companies, including guaranteeing drivers a minimum hourly take-home pay of $17.22 after expenses.\n\nUber and Lyft have chafed against regulations on both coasts, warning that they cause fares and wait times to increase while limiting driver earnings.\n\nIn New York, Lyft has frozen drivers out of its app during fallow periods to keep its costs down. Uber told drivers Friday that it would begin a similar initiative on Monday.\n\nUber has said that it doesn\u2019t believe the new California law applies to ride-share drivers and that it won\u2019t change its practices there. Both companies declined to comment on the possibility of statewide legislation in New York.\n\nThe Independent Drivers Guild, which represents ride-hailing drivers in New York City and which has a good relationship with Uber, doesn\u2019t support such legislation. The guild\u2019s executive director, Brendan Sexton, said Thursday that he worries it could undermine some of the gains made in the city, such as driver minimum pay. He also pointed out that drivers statewide already have workers\u2019 compensation insurance through a fund financed by a surcharge on trips. Classifying drivers as employees might also make it harder for them to unionize, he said.\n\nBut Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, which also represents drivers, said the legislation could provide many additional benefits, including paid sick leave and family leave. She added that a state law would also add an extra level of security for drivers in case the Taxi and Limousine Commission amends its regulations in the future.\n\n\u201cOnce you have protections under state law, you, as a sector of workers, get to enjoy the universal strength of millions of workers across that state,\u201d she said.\n\nThe New York state Labor Department currently looks at a variety of factors to determine whether a worker should be classified as an employee, examining the manner, means and results of work performed. Mr. Engelstein said his union would support an ABC test, like California passed, that took into account employer control, whether the services were within its core business and whether the worker was operating in an independent trade or business.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters at a press conference last week that the question is based on federal law but he would favor a definition of employee that protected more workers. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, said at a separate event that he also supported the concept.\n\nState Sen. Diane Savino, a Democrat from Staten Island, will convene a hearing on the subject on Oct. 16. She said in an interview that the topic was complicated and she hoped to hear from a variety of stakeholders. She said she hopes to develop a comprehensive policy that the state Legislature can consider when it reconvenes in January.\n\nTech:NYC executive director Julie Samuels, whose group represents technology companies, said she plans to testify at the hearing. She said companies rely on the flexibility they currently have, and she would rather see the state work on portable benefits systems that were less rooted in a particular employer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about taking a whole segment of the economy and tons of workers and trying to fit them into an old construct while we\u2019re using new technologies and new tools to work,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com and Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "description": "Buoyed by legislative passage of a bill in California, unions in New York are pushing to change state law to extend employment protections for app-based workers.", "authors": ["Jimmy Vielkind", "Paul Berger", "Jimmy.Vielkind Wsj.Com", "Paul.Berger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-97970/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
