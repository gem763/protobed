He died instantly from from neck and chest injuries.\n\nThe teen, who cannot be named, has today been sentenced to three years and two months in a Young Offender Institution at Bristol Crown Court.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Rice, accepting that he \"unlawfully killed\" him, on Thursday.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nJudge Peter Blair QC, the Recorder of Bristol, said reporting restrictions banning the identification of the defendant must remain in place following the case.\n\nHe told the boy: \"Your decision to drag a bicycle, on its side, off the pavement so as to cause an obstruction, was an unlawful and dangerous thing to do.\n\n\"In my view, when you took the decision to do that dangerous thing, you were doing it so as to impress the older teenagers around you.\n\n\"However, any reasonable person would have inevitably realised that doing so risked causing the motorcyclist some bodily harm. It was a reckless act.\"\n\nDuring the trial, Adam Vaitilingam QC said the motorbike Mr Rice had been riding on April 5 had been stolen a day earlier.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMr Rice was from the Knowle West area of Bristol and was riding around the Hartcliffe area in a \"provocative way\", he told the jury.\n\nThe keen motorcyclist first passed the Fulford Arms pub on Fulford Road once, drawing attention to himself from a crowd of children and young people outside.\n\nHe returned a second time, with people in the crowd suggesting that people should block the road to stop him - with one going forward on a bicycle to face him.\n\nThe teenager, then aged 15, grabbed hold of the YoBike and dragged it into the road.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nCollision investigators calculated that Mr Rice was travelling between 52mph and 55mph at the time of the impact with the YoBike.\n\nJudge Blair said it would have been possible for Mr Rice to have stopped to avoid the bike but he was accelerating and pulling a \"wheelie\" at the time.\n\n\"It was not the impact of the motorcycle with the bicycle which led to the fatality,\" the judge said.\n\n\"Instead it was his panicked reaction to what was in front of him in the road which led to him applying the front brake lever while the front wheel was still in the air.\n\n\"Tragically, that led to him going over the handlebars of the motorcycle when it touched down and he was killed in an instant when he collided with a parked van.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn a victim personal statement, Mr Rice's mother Donna Rice described the impact of her son's death on her family and his girlfriend.\n\n\"Mike was a loving, caring person,\" she said.\n\n\"It feels like so long since we have been able to see Mike's cheeky smile and hear his infectious laugh.\"\n\nAndrew Langdon QC, representing the boy, said he was \"horrified by the unintended consequences of his act\".\n\nThe defendant was screened off from the public gallery during his trial and sentencing.\n\n(Image: Bristol Post / SWNS.com)\n\nMembers of Mr Rice's family wept as the sentence was passed.\n\nSpeaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset Police, paid tribute to the \"courage and dignity\" shown by them through the case.\n\n\"We appreciate that to Michael's family and the wider community this sentence may seem lenient,\" he said.\n\n\"We are now looking to consider making a formal appeal to have the sentence reviewed.\"", "description": "Michael Rice died from neck and chest injuries when the YoBike was dragged in front of his motorcycle in Hartcliffe, Bristol", "authors": ["Claire Hayhurst", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Pa", "Bristol Post", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562269.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Untitled-design.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
