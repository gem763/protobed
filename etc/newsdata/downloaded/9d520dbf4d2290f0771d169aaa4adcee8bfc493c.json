The remarks are permeating every membrane of his presidency so much that they\u2019ve left aides and allies mastering verbal jiu-jitsu to defend his unprecedented approach to fusing personal business interests with his position in high office.\n\nThe interactions have led House Democrats \u2014 who have already launched an impeachment inquiry into whether Trump is illegally profiting off the presidency \u2014 and sometimes even his own staff to question whether his namesake businesses are influencing U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\u201cHe talks up his properties every chance he gets with anyone \u2014 with staff, with members of Congress, with the press, with the public, with foreign leaders, with anyone,\u201d said a former White House official. \u201cThat\u2019s what he has done. He\u2019s been a salesman. He\u2019s been a PR person for his properties for the last 50 years, so almost out of force of habit, that\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s conversations are facing renewed scrutiny after the White House initially announced late last week that the president planned to hold the G-7 summit at his financially struggling Trump National Doral Miami resort in June 2020 \u2014 awarding a federal contract to his own private company in an open rebuke of government ethics and his own pledges to put his business aside while in the White House.\n\nTrump reversed course with a Twitter announcement late Saturday night after days of pressure. That he would even consider holding the summit at his own resort brought days of intense criticism from not only Democrats and government ethics experts but pundits on his favorite television network \u2014 Fox News \u2014 and Republicans he needs to defend him against impeachment.\n\nThe House had been expected to vote this week on a resolution condemning Trump for holding the G-7 at the Doral resort and \u201crejecting his practice of accepting foreign government emoluments without obtaining Congress\u2019 affirmative consent.\u201c Despite Trump's G-7 reversal, his Doral gambit has trained congressional investigators' eyes even more closely on the president's continued blending of his private businesses with public work.\n\nAs president, Trump has met with leaders of at least 10 countries where he has a property or is developing one: Turkey, the Philippines, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Canada, Ireland, Panama, Dominican Republic and the United Arab Emirates, according to his schedules. He also met with leaders of three countries \u2014 China, Saudi Arabia and South Korea \u2014 where state-owned companies are developing new Trump resorts. Some of the governments are spending their own money on roads and other infrastructure for Trump\u2019s projects.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) said Trump's conversations with foreign leaders create a counterintelligence risk because other countries can use his personal and financial information against him. \u201cThey know the truth of those conversations and we may not know what's being said and they could use that against...him and manipulate him or members of his family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's always a possibility.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating whether Trump is violating the Constitution, which forbids a president from profiting from foreign governments unless approved by Congress or receiving any money from the U.S. government except his or her annual salary. He already faces lawsuits alleging he violated the Constitution.\n\nThe Oversight and Judiciary committees demanded the administration and Trump\u2019s company release details about both the president\u2019s call to host a G-7 summit at Doral and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump resort in Ireland. Those requests have been ignored.", "description": "President Donald Trump was sitting beside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office in March when he fondly recalled his luxury golf resort on Ireland\u2019s west coast.
