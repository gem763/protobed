Bolton by name but did seize on the ouster of the Trump administration\u2019s hawkish national security adviser to make headlines Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. should understand that warmongering and warmongers have no benefit and the warmongers should be set aside,\u201d Mr. Rouhani told a government meeting in Tehran, according to Iranian state-media reports that did mention Mr. Bolton\u2019s dismissal a day earlier.\n\nOther Iranian officials sought to downplay the notion U.S.-Iran tensions will be eased by Mr. Trump\u2019s firing of Mr. Bolton, who was widely seen as the administration\u2019s most aggressive Iran hardliner because he once advocated for regime change in Tehran.\n\nIran\u2019s FARS News Agency cited Abbas Ali Kadkhodayee, a spokesman for the Islamic republic\u2019s \u201cGuardian Council,\u201d which oversees the vetting of people allowed to run for office in the country, as saying Tehran does not believe it is likely Washington\u2019s policies will change because of Mr. Bolton\u2019s ouster.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. hostile and arrogant policies do not change by one person\u2019s dismissal,\u201d Mr. Kadkhodayee was quoted as saying via Twitter.

The White House has heaped such pressure against Tehran in the wake of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal last year from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe deal had given sanctions relief to Iran in exchange for limits to Iran\u2019s nuclear programs. Mr. Pompeo and others in the Trump administration have said their goal now is to pressure Iran into a new negotiation that addresses issues beyond the Islamic republic\u2019s nuclear activities, such as Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program and its backing of militant proxies around the Middle East.\n\nHowever, during the hours after Mr. Bolton\u2019s firing on Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo indicated that Mr. Trump remains open to direct talks with Iran, without any preconditions.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter whether there could be a meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Rouhani on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York later this month, Mr. Pompeo said: \u201cSure.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
