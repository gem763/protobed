How can you spend that time in a way that enables you to arrive calm and centered?\n\nThe need for pre-interview stress relievers is rising, as more college students and recent grads apply for serial internships, and more employees interview for internal transfers amid corporate restructuring.\n\nMany of them are finding offbeat ways to apply some proven stress-relief tactics. Here\u2019s a sampling:\n\nEmbrace empowering rituals\n\nEmma Valentiner lays the groundwork for tough interviews by donning what she calls ridiculous underwear. Wearing comfortable briefs adorned with pugs or cactuses makes an invisible fashion statement, lending her a sense of presence and confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s like that Mona Lisa smile\u2014a sign that I\u2019m bringing something special to the table,\u201d says Ms. Valentiner, a 40-year-old content manager and search-engine optimization specialist in Houston.\n\nAt the interview site, she stops by the restroom, steps into a stall and strikes a Superwoman pose. Feet firmly planted, hands on her hips and shoulders back, she breathes deeply for a couple of minutes to fortify her confidence. \u201cI see these as tiny little vibrational reminders that I can do these things, I\u2019ve got this,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like rituals to prepare yourself.\u201d\n\nWarming up your voice is another helpful habit, equipping people to speak in warmer, richer tones during an interview, says Julian Treasure, author of \u201cHow to Be Heard.\u201d In one exercise, the speaker imitates a siren by wailing aloud, ranging between high-pitched and low-pitched tones.\n\nGiovanni Gallo uses Mr. Treasure\u2019s siren exercise in private before interviews, alternating between what he calls squeals and bellows. \u201cIt has the added benefit of making you feel pretty silly, which can work wonders in calming your nerves,\u201d says Mr. Gallo, 34, co-CEO of ComplianceLine, a Charlotte, N.C., provider of compliance software and services.\n\nChange your mood\n\nSam White arrives a half-hour early for job interviews and uses meditation, writing and music to spark an upbeat, energetic mood. Photo: Sam White\n\nSam White wants to avoid going into an interview in a negative frame of mind, thinking, \u201cI\u2019m so nervous. What if this happens? What if that happens?\u201d he says. He evokes a contemplative state of mind instead by arriving early and finding a coffee shop to do breathing exercises and write a gratitude list. \u201cBefore asking for more, I think it\u2019s important to remember what\u2019s already great in your life,\u201d says Mr. White, 34, a marketing executive from Solana Beach, Calif.\n\nThen he downs a quarter-shot of tequila and chases it with breath mints and seltzer water. It\u2019s just a sip\u2014too small to get him buzzed. But \u201cit\u2019s a little shock of excitement,\u201d sparking invigorating memories of past trips to Mexico, Mr. White says. He also gets fired up with Wu-Tang Clan or other hip-hop artists. He says they get him flowing \u201cwith the right amount of swag and introspection.\u201d\n\nPhysical exercise can also change the way you feel, but building it into interview prep can be tricky. Krystal Covington runs the stairs or does push-ups at home before interviews. \u201cThis helps me get some of the jitters out,\u201d says Ms. Covington, 34, founder of Women of Denver, a networking group.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What\u2019s your best tip for relaxing before a job interview? Join the conversation below.\n\nTaking walks, climbing stairs and listening to musician Janelle Monae help Krystal Covington prepare for job interviews. Photo: Lynn Clark\n\nShe arrives early, parks a ways from the office and takes a walk, repeating to herself, \u201cYou\u2019re a great candidate,\u201d she says. If possible, she takes the stairs rather than the elevator\u2014but only for a maximum of three or four flights. She once ran up six flights for an interview and had to explain why she arrived breathing heavily and a bit winded, Ms. Covington says.\n\nShe even does isometrics while answering questions, wearing closed-toe shoes so she can squeeze her toes together during anxious moments\u2014such as if a senior executive joins the interview. \u201cAnything to release energy,\u201d she says.\n\nSome researchers say reading fiction can also quiet the mind and improve awareness. Thomas McFeeley brings a book to interviews and arrives early enough to find a place to read. Immersing himself in a few pages of fiction helps him to escape and get into a creative, storytelling state of mind.\n\nEarly in his career, the reading calmed him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so caught up in, am I wearing the right tie? Am I well-dressed? I was less self-conscious,\u201d says Mr. McFeeley, a 47-year-old media-relations director in Chicago.\n\nPrepare, prepare, prepare\n\nQuizzing yourself before an exam can improve performance, research shows. Before interviewing for a job as an actor at Disney World in Florida, Michael Tessler recorded some likely interview questions so he could practice his answers\u2014with a twist. He recorded the questions imitating the voices of Disney characters Mickey Mouse and Kermit the Frog, throwing in a few queries in the voice of Richard Nixon for good measure.\n\nWhen the Disney interviewer asked him some of the same questions, he suppressed a chuckle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t shake the sound of Kermit\u2019s voice,\u201d says Mr. Tessler, 26, chief executive of Multihouse Entertainment, a Los Angeles startup. \u201cThey said after the interview my constant smile was the reason I got the job. Little did they know that was because I saw Richard Milhous Nixon sitting in the interviewer\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nRoxana Colorado researches companies carefully before interviewing, then talks with friends and binge-watches TV to clear her mind. Photo: Angie Vasquez\n\nAnother confidence-builder is to study the company and the job thoroughly, then clear your mind, Roxana Colorado says.\n\nShe makes lists of her skills and examples of what she could offer, to assure herself that she\u2019s a good fit. When her research is done, she clears her mind by binge-watching \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d or another favorite TV series. \u201cI get to think about nothing while enjoying a great show\u201d for a while, says Ms. Colorado, founder of Kandula International, a strategic-planning consultant in Miami.\n\nBut she avoids the deadly all-nighter. She sets an alarm so she doesn\u2019t lose track of the time. \u201cIf not, I\u2019ll stay up all night,\u201d she says.\n\nTo Stay Calm Before a Job Interview\n\n* Thoroughly research the company, the people you\u2019ll be meeting and the role you want.\n\n* Make a list of your relevant strengths and accomplishments, showing you\u2019re a good fit.\n\n* Talk before the interview with a friend who relaxes you or brings out your best.\n\n* Envision yourself in a challenging, invigorating setting, then imagine feeling the same emotions in the interview.\n\n* Prepare a playlist of songs you find empowering to play before the interview.\n\n* Scope out the location in advance if it\u2019s unfamiliar.\n\n* Plan to arrive early and find a quiet place to meditate, do deep breathing or write down your anxieties.\n\nWrite to Sue Shellenbarger at sue.shellenbarger@wsj.com", "description": "Discovering offbeat ways to center yourself can put you in the perfect frame of mind when meeting a prospective employer.", "authors": ["Sue Shellenbarger", "Sue.Shellenbarger Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118468/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
