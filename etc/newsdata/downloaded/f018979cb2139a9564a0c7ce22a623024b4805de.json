Saudi Arabia pumped about 9.78 million barrels per day (bpd) in August.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. crude oil stockpiles likely rose 1.1 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Monday.", "description": "Oil prices rebounded on Tuesday on reports that output from the world's largest oil producers fell during the third quarter, although a resumption in Saudi supply and demand concerns kept a lid on gains.", "authors": ["Ahmad Ghaddar", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435717989&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF901SL", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
