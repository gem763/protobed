This list focuses primarily on high-end flagship devices, but the best flagship smartphones don't have to be the most expensive.\n\nValue plays a huge role in this list, and there's a couple mid-range device here that are well worth considering for more budget-minded buyers.\n\nIn fact, the top three phones in this list aren't the top flagship models everyone expects from Apple or Samsung.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIt would be easiest to rank smartphones based purely on specs and the number of features each offers, but that would mean the most expensive smartphones would always rank in the top three \u2014 and they're not the first phones I'd usually recommend.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for me when ranking and recommending a phone is its value in relation to its specs and features. That typically leads me to recommend phones that may have fewer features or a less-sleek design than the ultra-premium models that command four-figure price tags.\n\nIndeed, just because a phone has everything and the kitchen sink doesn't mean you have to buy it \u2014 it's just an option for those who might have a larger budget. The same logic applies to pretty much anything you can buy: Do you pick the most expensive model of everything you buy? If you don't, the top three will suit you well. If you always go with the top-of-the-line, then you probably already know the phone you want.\n\nCheck out our list of the top 20 smartphones in 2019 that you can buy:", "description": "When it comes to smartphones, giant price tags don't always mean you're getting the best phone out there.", "authors": ["Antonio Villas-Boas"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8e25322e22af73e23a25f0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
