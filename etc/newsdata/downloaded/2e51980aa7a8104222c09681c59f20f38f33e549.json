CCL, -7.62% tumbled 8.3% in morning trading Thursday, after the cruise operator reported fiscal third-quarter profit that beat expectations but cut its full-year outlook, citing a recent increase in fuel prices. Net income for the quarter to Aug. 31 rose to $1.78 billion, or $2.58 a share, from $1.71 billion, or $2.41 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share came to $2.63, above the FactSet consensus of $2.53. Revenue increased to $6.53 billion from $5.84 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $6.21 billion, as better-than-expected onboard and tour revenue helped offset a slight miss in passenger ticket revenue. The company said it expects fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of 46 cents to 50 cents, below the FactSet consensus of 64 cents, and cut its 2019 EPS guidance range to $4.23 to $4.27 from $4.25 to $4.35, which compares with expectations of $4.33. Carnival said a recent spike in fuel prices was caused by \"geopolitical events.\" The stock has dropped 11% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.21% has rallied 19%.", "description": "Shares of Carnival Corp. tumbled 8.3% in morning trading Thursday, after the cruise operator reported fiscal third-quarter profit that beat expectations but...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
