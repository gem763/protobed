Protesters use masks to shield their identities.\n\nHowever, hundreds of people, including school children and office workers, have since defied the ban and wore face masks. A group of protesters plan a \"face mask party\" on Saturday night.\n\nCRISIS OF CONFIDENCE\n\nHong Kong's police, once praised as \"Asia's finest\", are also facing a crisis of confidence amid the worsening political tensions. Protesters accuse them of using excessive force, a charge police deny, and two protesters have been shot and wounded during skirmishes with police.\n\nApple Inc removed an app this week that helped protesters track police movements, saying it was used to target officers.\n\nHong Kong is also facing its first recession in a decade due to the protests, with tourism and retail hardest hit.\n\nMany shops have been shutting early to avoid becoming a target of protesters and due to closures of the metro rail system after several stations were torched and trashed.\n\nMetro operator MTR Corporation said services would end at 10pm (1400 GMT) on Saturday and the express train linking the airport with the city would not stop at stations in between from 3pm local time.\n\nThe Hong Kong Jockey Club said it would close eight off-course betting branches and shut another 20 early on Saturday to protect its employees.\n\nHong Kong's financial chief urged landlords and property developers on Friday to offer rent subsidies to retailers and food and beverage businesses. Leader Carrie Lam will make her annual policy speech on Wednesday.\n\nMany fear China has been eroding Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed under a \"one country, two systems\" formula introduced with the 1997 handover.\n\nThe now-withdrawn extradition bill, under which residents would have been sent to Communist-controlled mainland courts, was seen as the latest move to tighten control.\n\nChina denies the accusation and says foreign countries, including Britain and the United States, are fomenting unrest.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said in announcing a partial trade deal with China on Friday that he had raised Hong Kong in the talks after previously warning that a deteriorating situation in the city could affect the negotiations.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Several pro-democracy protests are planned for Hong Kong on Saturday reflecting the widespread anger at the government, ranging from an elderly sit-in, a face mask party, a shopping mall demonstration and an anti-emergency law street march. .
