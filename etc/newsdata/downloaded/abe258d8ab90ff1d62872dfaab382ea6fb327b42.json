They will take a view about whether they want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or the beginning of 2021.'\n\nHe added: 'We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That's democracy. There are other views within the party but that's our view.'\n\nOne opposition MP said: 'Even in the most causal of conversations, it's been clear the SNP are trying to use cross party working to get support for another Indyref.\n\n'With Corbyn making noises about not objecting and the SNP ignorning numbers to support him as an interim PM, it doesn't take a genius to see the mutual convenience.'\n\nMr Blackford has raised suspicions after taking Mr Corbyn's side despite the protests of others who attend the meetings\n\nOne opposition official said: 'It's very suspicious. They appear to be speaking from the same script. It's like the SNP have found a reason to back up Corbyn and it isn't hard to guess what that might be.'\n\nAn opposition source who attends the meetings said: 'Labour and the SNP are agreeing a script.' They say that following discussions in the room, Mr Blackford always goes out to deal with the press first, and then Labour go second, and with agreed lines.\n\n'Blackford goes out first to the media and Jeremy Corbyn will come in behind after Blackford has done the hard stuff. He'll say Corbyn has the right to form a government and we should do this early.\n\n'If feels as if there is this dialogue between the two parties about their own position on interim PM, despite the numbers, and specifically about indyref2.'\n\nA Labour party spokesman said: 'Jeremy Corbyn has hosted a series of productive meetings with opposition party leaders in order to work together today to hold the government to account and prevent a disastrous No Deal Brexit.'\n\nThey noted that Mr Corbyn has ruled out backing a second referendum in Scotland.\n\nAn SNP source said: 'It speaks volumes that while the SNP is doing everything we can to stop Boris Johnson dragging the UK out of the EU with a devastating Brexit, the Lib Dems are wasting time with childish briefings against other opposition parties.\n\n'Having stood in the way of every attempt to bring the Tory government down and stop Brexit, Jo Swinson will have serious questions to answer if the UK now crashes out of the EU with a bad deal or no deal.'", "description": "The SNP Westminster leader backs Mr Corbyn's (pictured) claim to be the best person to form a government if a no confidence vote against Boris Johnson succeeds.", "authors": ["Claire Ellicott", "Political Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19807528-0-image-a-33_1571259330836.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
