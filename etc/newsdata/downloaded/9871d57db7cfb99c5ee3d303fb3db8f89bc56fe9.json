That is the way that show rolls.'\n\nThey're not buying it! WSFM's Amanda Keller and Brendan Jones (pictured on Saturday) say that Kyle and Jackie O's record $80million deal with ARN is likely a 'pumped-up' figure\n\n'I don't take anything away from them with that, that is their thing, that is what they do. They respect us and we respect them,' he added.\n\nAmanda, 57, added: 'We actually really like [Kyle and Jackie O] and we are very pragmatic, they have their show and they have their style of doing things and we have our style of doing things.\n\n'You'd be bashing your head against a brick wall if you cared [about salaries] and let it get to you but I will be hitting them up for some bus money.'\n\nBig bucks: Kyle and Jackie O (pictured) have reportedly signed a deal worth $80million with the Australian Radio Network (ARN), the parent company that owns KIIS 106.5\n\nAfter accepting her award for Best On-Air Team (FM) at the ACRAs, Amanda became emotional as she said: 'This just means the world to me.
