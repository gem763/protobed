The embassy will closely monitor the process and remain in contact with the Thai authorities to facilitate her soonest possible return to SA,\" Kgwete said.\n\nSome on Twitter have had sympathy for Nobanda.\n\nApproximately 1.5kg of cocaine, with an estimated street value of R1.2m, was found in her dreadlocks after police noticed a white substance in her hair, News24 earlier reported.\n\nNobanda told Thailand authorities that she had been hired to deliver the drugs to a customer at a hotel in Bankgok.\n\nInitially sentenced to 30 years in prison, Nobanda's sentence was first halved and then reduced by two-and-a-half years in May.\n\nHenk Vanstaen, a Thailand resident who assists South Africans incarcerated in the kingdom, confirmed Nobanda's release to HeraldLIVE.\n\nHe reportedly said she would be taken to the prison where she was initially apprehended to be fingerprinted.\n\nAfter this she would be transferred to the IDC.\n\nVanstaen told HeraldLIVE it was expected that she would fly back to South Africa about five days later.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
