The U.S. also ditched a planned tariff hike on $250 billion in Chinese goods that was set to take effect Oct. 15.\n\nAsked about the Chilean cancellation, a White House spokesman told CNBC's Eamon Javers, \"We don't know. I'm going to get to the bottom of it.\"\n\nTrump had said the agreement would address issues such as intellectual property and financial services and include a pledge for China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion in American agricultural products.\n\nThe U.S. said Monday that it is considering extending certain tariff exclusions on $34 billion of imports from China as the two nations work toward a trade agreement. Exemptions on nearly 1,000 products are set to expire in December.", "description": "Chile said it's calling off the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Santiago in mid-November.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104418131-RTX34MFE.jpg?v=1569239004", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
