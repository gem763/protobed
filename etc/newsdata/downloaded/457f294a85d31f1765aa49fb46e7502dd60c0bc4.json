They have worked, they are working, they are cutting off the money,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nHe told Netanyahu: \"We will continue to ramp up, more, more, more ... I just came from a very productive working lunch with your team. They gave us a bunch of very specific ideas that we will be following up.\"\n\nSince leaving the nuclear deal last year, Washington has been trying to strangle Iran's oil exports, the mainstay of its economy. The sanctions have dismantled part of former U.S. president Barack Obama\u2019s legacy and upset U.S. allies who were party to the 2015 deal, which was designed to restrict Tehran\u2019s pathway to a nuclear bomb in exchange for sanctions relief.\n\nThe Islamic Republic denies it is seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nNetanyahu, who strongly opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, said Iran's ability to develop weaponry that could threaten any country in the Middle East could be diminished by tightening sanctions.\n\n\"So I want to thank you for what you've been doing and encourage you, Steve, to do more - more, a lot more,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Jeffrey Heller/Mark Heinrich)", "description": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday the United States would increase economic pressure on Iran over its nuclear program, making the pledge during a Middle East trip that includes visits to U.S. allies Israel and Saudi Arabia.
