The lawyers want to quit the case because they don\u2019t ever expect to be paid. The documents cited Holmes \u201ccurrent financial situation\u201d without elaborating.\n\nDwyer didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. A message left for Holmes\u2018 attorney in a separate criminal case in San Jose, California, wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges of conspiracy and fraud in a case that is scheduled to go to trial next summer.\n\nA trial date hasn\u2019t been set for the civil lawsuit filed against Holmes, Theranos and Walgreens, which offered Theranos\u2018 blood-testing technology in Arizona and California. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of consumers who paid for Theranos\u2018 blood testing service.\n\nHolmes, a former Stanford University student, started Theranos in Palo Alto on the promise it had developed a way to perform complex blood analysis with a finger prick. Federal authorities asserted that Theranos\u2018 technology didn\u2019t work as advertised, duping both the company\u2019s investors and customers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The founder of scandalized blood-testing startup Theranos is now being accused of skipping out on bills owed to the lawyers defending her against fraud charges in a civil lawsuit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
