The president attributed the \"gesture of goodwill\", as he described it via Twitter (link), to the People's Republic's 70th anniversary commencing on Oct. 1. and came at the request of China's chief trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nThe moves come as American and Chinese representatives are slated to meet in early October to restart stalled trade negotiations and avert any further escalation of animosities between the economic superpowers.\n\nHowever, no date has been set to begin the high-level discussions, but the latest olive branch does help to reflect a momentary softening of tensions between Beijing and Washington, which had rattled global economies, because an outright trade war could further weaken an already slowing global economy.\n\n\"The S&P 500 has now fully retraced the August pullback, and in doing so has priced in a lasting U.S.-China trade truce and aggressive [global] central bank easing ... and no more geopolitical surprises,\" wrote Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report in a Thursday note to clients.\n\n\"Proof of that is evident in the lack of a rally despite the short tariff delay announcement,\" he added. \"At these levels, a trade \"truce\" (so no more tariffs) is mostly priced into stocks, just a delay won't be a positive catalyst--the market already expects more.\"\n\nStock-index futures rose following the decision by the European Central Bank to cut its deposit rate from -0.4% to -0.5%, while announcing it would begin purchasing long-term government bonds at a pace of EUR20 billion a month in an effort to further reduce long-term interest rates. The bank said rates would remain at \"present or lower levels\" until the inflation outlook \"robustly\" converges with its target of just below 2%.\n\nRead: The ECB's challenge: Pushing rates further into negative territory without wrecking eurozone banks (link)\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the effects of negative rates on bank profitability, the central bank introduced a system of tiered rates that will exempt some bank reserves held at the ECB.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi will explain the moves at a news conference set for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn the economic data front, the Labor Department will issue a reading on new claims for unemployment insurance at 8:30 a.m., along with a fresh reading of the consumer-price index.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Oracle Corp.

The U.S. dollar , meanwhile, edged 0.2% higher relative to a basket of leading rivals.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, the China CSI 300 l gained 1.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.8%.
