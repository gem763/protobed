Walk the Moon\u2019s \u201cShut Up and Dance\u201d mashed with Pink\u2019s \u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d: I rolled. The nefarious and wealthy Duke getting introduced by bars of Nelly\u2019s \u201cRide Wit Me\u201d \u2014 Hey, must be the money! \u2014 I rolled again. By the time Aaron Tveit belted out an admittedly beautiful combination of Adele\u2019s \u201cRolling in the Deep\u201d and Gnarls Barkley\u2019s \u201cCrazy,\u201d I was concerned about vision damage \u2014 that if I rolled my eyes Offenbach (this is Moulin Rouge!; you should have been expecting a \u201cCancan\u201d joke or twelve) much farther into my head they\u2019d stick like that forever. My New York colleague Sara Holdren called the show \u201cBroadway\u2019s biggest karaoke night.\u201d This is apt. It\u2019s also not a compliment.\n\nThe thing about the show is that the songs zing past so quickly that you can\u2019t fully process what you\u2019re hearing. Sure, there are really easy ones to pick out. Karen Olivo sings Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cFirework\u201d from start to finish, with only minor cuts. But a lot of the songs only appear for a few bars, or are sampled solely in the orchestral lines but never sung. Which meant a lot of sitting, listening, and internally saying, Oh wait \u2026 I think I know that, but not necessarily having enough time for your synapses to fire and fill in the blank. When the cast album dropped on Spotify, I popped in my earbuds and spent some time compiling a Vulture list of every song in the show. (There are roughly 70. I am still missing a few.)\n\nThat was when something weird happened. I started to like what I was hearing. \u201cSuch Great Heights\u201d by the Postal Service, popping up in the iconic \u201cElephant Love Medley,\u201d didn\u2019t feel like a jarring and random addition. It felt creative. Musically smart. \u201cFirework\u201d was no longer intended to scream \u201cHello, we have updated this show since the movie came out in 2001!\u201d When it didn\u2019t have to serve as a plot-device shoehorn, \u201cCrazy Rolling\u201d sounded good. I got to enjoy Aaron Tveit\u2019s perfect voice without suppressing the part of my brain that was ticking down the minutes until I could leave the theater. It\u2019s the kind of mashup that my brain \u2014 raised on a diet of Glee, Pitch Perfect, and college a cappella performances \u2014 grooved with immediately.\n\nYou can always find the former a cappella kid at a party because they\u2019re the one singing a different song, perfectly slotted into whatever pop tune is playing. (A cappella parties are a special kind of hell if you\u2019re not into six-part harmony and at least one too-drunk someone in the corner crying incoherently.) The Moulin Rouge! album, which made its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Broadway chart, works the same way. Start with Lorde\u2019s \u201cRoyals.\u201d (Picture this being sung onstage by, very literally, a motley cohort of bohemians who mean it when they say they\u2019ve \u201cnever seen a diamond in the flesh.\u201d Now picture me rolling my eyes.) Toss in \u201cChildren of the Revolution\u201d by T. Rex. And then a healthy heaping of \u201cWe Are Young\u201d by fun. It works seamlessly, and it\u2019s fun \u2014 sorry \u2014 as hell to listen to.\n\nThe mashup of Walk the Moon\u2019s \u201cShut Up and Dance\u201d and Pink\u2019s \u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d feels like it came out of a Ryan Murphy fever dream. (Actually, it might have. Darren Criss performed it on \u201cGlee.\u201d) I mean this in a good way: It\u2019s the kind of perfect mashup that, in the hands of the right college a cappella group, could be an ICCA winner. (The ICCAs are the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella. Think of it like the World Series, but with college kids who\u2019d prefer to wear tastefully coordinated but not matching black outfits and whose version of a home run is a well-deployed unison sforzando piano for dramatic effect.) Listening to \u201cCrazy Rolling,\u201d I was reminded of another \u201cCrazy\u201d mashup I love. This one from the USC SoCal Vocals, it\u2019s \u201cCrazy\u201d tossed with \u201cNatalie\u201d by Bruno Mars. The song was part of the group\u2019s ICCA-winning set in 2015 and is, frankly, a little more of a nuanced mashup than the one currently on Broadway. But, still, you get the idea.\n\nIt\u2019s a foolproof format, mixing one hit into another, and, as anybody who knows even a little about music will tell you, it\u2019s simple to replicate \u2014 at least in terms of the basic mechanics. You know that old viral video of the guy with the guitar ranting about how every song is just Pachabel\u2019s \u201cCanon in D?\u201d This is the same idea. Pick a pop song with a basic four-chord structure, and smash it into another pop song with a basic four-chord structure. Rinse and repeat, ad nauseam. What\u2019s difficult, and what Moulin Rouge! does right, is mashing songs you already recognize and, ideally, like. And it buries little gems, like the orchestra\u2019s riff on Shakira and Wyclef Jean\u2019s \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie,\u201d for you to find upon second (or third) listen. There\u2019s a few bars of Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody\u201d right at the end of the Pink x Walk the Moon mashup. It\u2019s incredibly satisfying when you hear it. Your brain recognizes that it had been hearing Whitney all along and you start to realize a bad jukebox musical can, at the very least, make for a good playlist.", "description": "The Moulin Rouge Broadway cast album is surprisingly good.
