More than a dozen states have promised to adopt these tougher standards.\n\nThe Justice Department responded by launching an antitrust investigation into the four automakers.\n\nFor their part, automakers have been cautious in responding. Dave Schwietert, interim CEO and president of the industry group Auto Alliance, said his group was still reviewing the action to \u201cget the full picture of how this impacts automakers, our workers and our customers.\u201d\n\nIn his statement though, he noted the group supports \u201cone national program\u201d and to \u201cavoid a marketplace with different standards.\u201d\n\nSen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, warned that automakers didn\u2019t want the years of uncertainty with a protracted legal fight as the nation debates tailpipe pollution.\n\nBased on \u201cnumerous meetings and conversations, I am confident that no auto maker wanted this outcome,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cin fact, it\u2019s the exact outcome they sought to avoid.\u201d\n\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler was expected to discuss the plan at his agency headquarters with Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Thursday.\n\nIn a speech Tuesday before a group of auto dealers, he said California was overstepping its regulatory bounds.\n\n\u201cWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nonprofit Consumer Reports has estimated Trump\u2019s 2018 proposal to scrap Obama-era fuel standards for new cars and light-duty trucks would cost consumers about $460 billion dollars in savings in coming years.", "description": "The Trump administration is revoking California\u2019s waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, President Trump claimed in a tweet.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/california-emissions-file-rt-jef-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
