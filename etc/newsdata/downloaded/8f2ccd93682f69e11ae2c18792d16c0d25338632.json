Dan Crenshaw draws backlash for his take on universal background checks", "language": "en", "text": "ABC News reported Tuesday that a young woman opened fire on five men trying to rob her. She was unharmed, while at least one of the bad guys was shot.\n\nFive men tried to rob a young woman this morning. They didn\u2019t expect her to grab her handgun and fire. Today, she is unharmed, and at least one suspect is shot.

A reasonable take, sure. He didn\u2019t leave it there, though \u2014 and this is when things went sideways:\n\n\u2018With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves.\u2019\n\nThe internet\u2019s collective response:\n\nThe general sentiment: Should we be able to loan out guns? Are Crenshaw\u2019s friends trained to handle the weapons? If so, don\u2019t they have their own? Etc. Of course, not everybody took issue with his stance, but it was the critics that made Crenshaw a trending topic on Twitter TWTR, -1.04% on Wednesday.\n\nABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd asked, \u201cWould you loan your car to someone with no license or insurance?\u201d And former NFL QB Sage Rosenfels wrote, \u201cDan treats guns like tennis racquets.\u201d\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has tangled on social media with Crenshaw in the past, also chimed in, drawing plenty of backlash of her own when she made some assumptions about his pals:\n\nYou are a member of Congress. Why are you \u201clending\u201d guns to people unsupervised who can\u2019t pass a basic background check?\n\n\n\nThe people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, & you may not know it.\n\n\n\nWhy on earth would you do that? https://t.co/TQFjcLQebO \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 4, 2019\n\nCrenshaw earlier this year opposed a universal-background-check bill, claiming the law wouldn\u2019t have prevented \u201dall of the tragedies we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nHe explained his view here:\n\nThe truth about universal background checks and today\u2019s vote. pic.twitter.com/koigvhKKYT \u2014 Rep. Dan Crenshaw (@RepDanCrenshaw) February 27, 2019\n\nElisa Cardnell, a Democrat running against Crenshaw in 2020, also had a problem with his take. \u201cIf you can\u2019t pass a background check, you shouldn\u2019t have a gun. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d she told ThinkProgress. \u201cThis is all part of a repeated pattern of dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric from him regarding gun safety.\u201d\n\nRead: Gun-control policies like universal background checks have different impacts in cities and rural areas, new study says", "description": "The Texas Republican and passionate gun-rights backer cited a story about a woman opening fire on her attackers as to \u201cwhy we protect the 2nd Amendment.\u201d OK,...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ671_crensh_MG_20190904120134.jpg"}
