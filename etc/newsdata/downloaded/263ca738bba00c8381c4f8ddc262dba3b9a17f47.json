Every Democrat present voted no. The full vote tally is here.\n\nWalker \u201cdoes not presently have the requisite trial or litigation experience\u201d to be a federal judge, the ABA\u2019s Standing Committee concluded in a July review.\n\nThe nonpartisan ABA, which thoroughly reviews each of a president\u2019s judicial nominees, typically requires that someone chosen for a lifetime court seat have at least 12 years of experience practicing law. It\u2019s not an automatic disqualifier, though, if a nominee has other substantial trial or courtroom experience. Walker falls short on both counts.\n\n\u201cMr. Walker\u2019s experience to date has a very substantial gap, namely the absence of any significant trial experience,\u201d the ABA found. \u201cMr. Walker has never tried a case as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal. ... In addition, based on review of his biographical information and conversations with Mr. Walker, it was challenging to determine how much of his ten years since graduation from law school has been spent in the practice of law.\u201d\n\nSo why did Walker get nominated? Because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) wanted him to. He recommended Walker to the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is unquestionably the most outstanding nomination that I\u2019ve ever recommended to Presidents to serve on the bench in Kentucky,\u201d McConnell tweeted in July, just a day after the ABA issued its rating of Walker\u2019s qualifications.\n\nMcConnell praised Walker again on Thursday on the Senate floor, calling him \u201cbrilliant\u201d and an \u201coutstanding choice\u201d by the president (even though McConnell chose him).\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) noted how rare it is for the Senate to move forward with a judicial nominee with a \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating.\n\n\u201cIt seems the only reason Mr. Walker has been nominated for an austere judgeship is his membership in the Federalist Society,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor, referring to the conservative legal group driving many of the White House\u2019s court picks. \u201cAnd his far-right-wing views on health care, civil rights and executive power.\u201d\n\nWalker, a University of Louisville law professor, previously clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, also a Federalist Society member, when he was a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2018, Walker went out of his way to defend his former boss against credible allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her in high school. Walker participated in more than 70 media interviews challenging Ford.\n\n\u201cShe may believe that assailant was Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d Walker said in a Fox News interview in September 2018. \u201cI believe she\u2019s mistaken.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s ascension marks the fifth time that Republicans have confirmed one of President Donald Trump\u2019s court picks who earned a \u201cnot qualified\u201d rating from the ABA.\n\nBy contrast, in his entire eight years in the White House, President Barack Obama didn\u2019t nominate anyone to be a lifetime federal judge who earned a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating.", "description": "Justin Walker, 37, lacks the experience to be a lifetime federal judge, says the American Bar Association.
