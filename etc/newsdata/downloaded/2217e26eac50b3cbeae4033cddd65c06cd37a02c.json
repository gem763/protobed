A 4 under the new system equates to an old Grade C.\n\nThe English Baccalaureate measures how well students have performed across five core subjects: English, Maths, one science, either history or geography, and a language.\n\nAnother all-girls' school comes in second on this year's list: the Tiffin Girls' School in Kingston upon Thames.\n\nAttainment 8: Measures average pupil achievement across eight subjects, including English and Maths.\n\nProgress 8: Measures progress over school career in Attainment 8 subjects (Average=0, higher=better)\n\n% 9 to 4 in English and Maths: Percentage of pupils getting at least the equivalent to an old Grade C in their English and Maths GCSEs\n\n% 9 to 4 in English Baccalaureate: Percentage of pupils achieving the English Baccalaureate - meaning at least the equivalent of an old Grace C in English, Maths, one science, either history or geography, and a language.\n\nThe Tiffin Girls' School (pictured), Kingston upon Thames is an academy and came third\n\nAt the other end of the scale, special schools fared worst with two institutions - one in Oxfordshire, the other in Lancashire, getting an Attainment 8 score of zero.\n\nThis summer was the third year that reformed GCSEs graded 9 to 1 have been awarded, with the changes extended to an additional 25 subjects as compared with 2018.\n\nIn total over 99 per cent of GCSE entries this year were for the reformed GCSEs, with a handful of specialist language courses to be changed next year.\n\nThe government says the changes have been made to better prepare students for further study and work, are more stretching for the most able students, and are designed to be accessible to the full range of students who have traditionally taken GCSEs.\n\nThe top ten schools for GCSE results in England and Wales 1. The Henrietta Barnett School, Barnet Pupils at the Henrietta Barnet academy converter school in Barnet achieved an Attainment 8 score of 85.1, the highest in the country.

Two girls schools came top of the league table this year\n\nThe 2019 results show that overall GCSE outcomes at grade 4/C in England have remained largely stable in recent years.\n\nMore than one in five (20.8 per cent) UK GCSE entries scored one of the three top grades this year, up from 20.5 per cent last summer, despite headteachers claiming the exams were so hard some pupils refused to sit them.\n\nThe proportion receiving the top grades - at least a 7 or an A grade - is the highest since 2015 and is the second year-on-year rise in a row.\n\nThe proportion of entries getting at least a 4 or a C grade is also the highest since 2015.\n\nThe bottom ten schools for GCSE results in England and Wales The worst ten results were achieved by special schools, community special schools, or foundation special schools. No pupils at these schools passed their English or Maths GCSE, nor their English Baccalaureate. 1. Bishopswood School, Oxfordshire Attain8: 0 | Progress8: -1.61 2. Pendle Community High School & College, Lancashire Attain8: 0 | Progress8: -1.53 3. Abbey Hill Academy, Stockton-on-Tees Attain8: 0.1 | Progress8: -2.07% 4.

In England major changes to the GCSE mark scheme have been phased in alongside what the government says is a more demanding curriculum. 9 is the highest grade, while 1 is the lowest, not including a U (ungraded). Three number grades, 9, 8 and 7, correspond to the old-style top grades of A* and A - this is designed to give more differentiation at the top end. How the grades compare Old grades New grades A*\n\nA 9\n\n8\n\n7 B\n\nC 6\n\n5 STRONG PASS\n\n4 STANDRD PASS D\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG 3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nU U A 4 is broadly being compared to a C grade, although Ofqual warns against 'direct comparisons and overly simplistic descriptions'. It says broadly the same proportion of pupils will get a grade four and above as used to get a grade C or above.\n\nThe number of UK entries getting C/4 or above in English and maths has increased slightly since last year.\n\nA total of 62 per cent of UK entries scored C/4 or above in English, up from 61.8 per cent, while 59.6 per cent of entries scored C/4 in maths, up from 59.4 per cent.\n\nThe number of people getting a clean sweep of seven or more 9 grades has risen from 732 to 837.\n\nBut Ofqual said this was because more subjects are now being graded 1 to 9 this year.\n\nLast year a significant number were still graded A* to f so those entries would not have counted towards the 2018 grade 9s figure.\n\nOfqual, the exams regulator, ordered exam boards every year to make sure roughly the same proportion of people get each grade - so around 20 per cent of entries will always get a 7, or A, and above.\n\nNansi Ellis, assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, congratulated students, but raised concerns about the reformed GCSEs being 'significantly worse for the mental health of students'.\n\nShe said: 'Removing coursework and having most subjects assessed entirely by exams taken at the end of Year 11 makes GCSEs an all-or-nothing, high-stakes experience for students, completely unnecessarily, and focuses study on what will be best for passing the exam, rather than on developing a wider skill set.", "description": "Henrietta Barnett girls' school in London  achieved the top 'Attainment 8' score of 85.1.
