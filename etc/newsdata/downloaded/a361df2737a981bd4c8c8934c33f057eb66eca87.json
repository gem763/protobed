The Fed has been using its power to cut short-term interest rates in a bid to shore up the economy amid the costly impact from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nWith its latest rate cut, the Fed has nearly reversed the four rate hikes that it made in 2018.\n\nStocks wobbled shortly after the Fed\u2019s midafternoon announcement, which had been widely anticipated by traders. The market then rallied into the close, led by gains in technology and health care stocks. Bond yields fell.\n\n\u201cThe rate cut was expected and also the market had been expecting a change in the language regarding another rate cut this year,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cThe Fed just basically upped the bar for another rate cut by suggesting that the economy is in a good place.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 index rose 9.88 points, or 0.3%, to 3,046.77. The benchmark index also hit record high on Monday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 115.27, or 0.4%, to 27,186.69. The Nasdaq composite added 27.12 points, or 0.3%, to 8,303.98.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index of smaller company stocks fell 4.23 points, or 0.3%, to 1,572.85.\n\nMajor stock indexes in Europe closed mostly higher.\n\nU.S. stock indexes were mostly flat ahead of the Fed\u2019s announcement Wednesday.\n\nThe central bank\u2019s latest move reduces the short-term rate it controls \u2014 which influences many consumer and business loan rates \u2014 to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.\n\nLower rates are intended to encourage more borrowing and spending. Rising global risks have led the Fed to change course after hiking rates four times last year.\n\nThe market was expecting another cut this month, which shifted investors\u2019 focus to what the Fed might say about the prospects of further rate reductions.\n\nDuring a news conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank will likely forgo additional cuts to its benchmark rates while economic growth and inflation matches the Fed\u2019s outlook.\n\n\u201cA few weeks back, the shift in language suggesting at least a pause would have been a disappointment,\u201d said Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital. \u201cBut whether by design or not, we\u2019ve seen a steady flow in expectations toward exactly what happened. So, it is not surprising the reaction is muted or moderately positive.\u201d\n\nThe central bank\u2019s rate reductions are intended as a kind of insurance against threats to the economy, which is in its 11th year of expansion, fueled by consumer spending and a solid if slightly weakened job market.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the U.S. economy slowed to a modest growth rate of 1.9% in the July-September quarter. That surpassed economists\u2019 forecasts for even weaker growth, however.\n\nThe report indicated that consumer spending downshifted and businesses continued to trim their investments in response to trade war uncertainty and a weakening global economy.\n\nTechnology and health care companies drove much of the market\u2019s broad gains Wednesday. Microsoft rose 1.3%, while Johnson & Johnson climbed 2.9%.\n\nThose sectors helped offset losses in energy and financial stocks.\n\nEnergy stocks took the heaviest losses. Chevron slid 1.5% and Helmerich & Payne fell 4.3%. The sector dropped 2.1%, lowering its gains for the year to just 1.1%. That\u2019s the smallest gain of all the sectors in the S&P 500.\n\nSeveral big banks helped pull financial sector stocks lower as bond yields declined. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped to 1.77% from 1.83% late Tuesday. The yield is a benchmark for interest rates that bank charge for mortgages and other loans. JPMorgan dropped 0.6% and Bank of America slid 1.4%.\n\nInvestors continued to focus on a steady flow of corporate earnings.\n\nApple, Facebook and Lyft climbed in after-hours trading after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street\u2019s forecasts. Twitter slumped after the social media company announced it is banning political ads from its service. CEO Jack Dorsey said advertising on social media offers an unfair level of targeting compared to other mediums that brings significant risks to politics.\n\nMattel surged 13.8% after the toy maker breezed past Wall Street\u2019s third-quarter profit forecasts on strong sales of its Barbie and Hot Wheels brands. The company also put investors at ease when it said that it hasn\u2019t seen any impact from tariff increases on toys imported from China ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline.\n\nGeneral Electric jumped 11.5% after the industrial conglomerate raised its projections for a key measure of profitability despite a damaging trade fight and ongoing problems with Boeing\u2019s 737 Max, which GE helps make engines for.\n\nMolson Coors Brewing, which trades under the symbol \u201cTAP,\u201d fell 3.1% after announcing a restructuring plan as it faces declining beer sales. The company is laying off 500 workers worldwide as it streamlines operations in a bid to bring new products to market more quickly, like the canned wine and hard coffee it introduced this year.\n\nBenchmark crude oil fell 48 cents to settle at $55.06 a barrel. Brent crude oil, the international standard, dropped 98 cents to close at $60.61 a barrel.\n\nIn other commodities trading, wholesale gasoline fell 3 cents to $1.66 per gallon. Heating oil declined 5 cents to $1.91 per gallon. Natural gas rose 5 cents to $2.69 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $5.80 to $1,493.20 per ounce, silver rose 4 cents to $17.82 per ounce and copper fell 1 cent to $2.68 per pound.\n\nThe dollar rose to 108.97 Japanese yen from 108.81 yen on Tuesday. The euro strengthened to $1.1125 from $1.1110.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Damian J.
