According to the New York Times, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general considered the matter an \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2013 a distinction \u201chigh on the intelligence community threat level,\u201d Colbert said, referring to his threat-level scale of \u201cnot a problem; uh oh!; Urgent concern; Chrissy Teigen attack\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, after the initial article on the whistleblower, the New York Times reported that the whistleblower complaint actually concerned a series of actions by Trump beyond one phone conversation with a foreign leader. \u201cOh, a series!\u201d Colbert said. \u201cGreat \u2013 now we can binge-watch the end of America.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers: \u2018Could be anyone\u2019\n\nOn Late Night, Seth Meyers took a closer look at the whistleblower complaint.\n\nThe story is still developing, Meyers said \u2013 it\u2019s not revealed which leader Trump was speaking to on the phone, or what they were talking about. To help keep the \u201ccomplicated\u201d story straight, Meyers composed a helpful mnemonic device: \u201cremember, it\u2019s a Promise from the United States, made by Trump, to an International leader, but we do not know their Name.\u201d (Putin, in case you need a reminder.)\n\n\u201cCould be anyone,\u201d Meyers shrugged.\n\nThis is the first internal whistleblower complaint revealed to be about Trump, which surprised Meyers. \u201cThe way this guy behaves,\u201d he said, \u201cthere should be literal whistleblowers following him everywhere he goes.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah: \u2018\u2018He\u2019s dressed as Aladdin doing blackface\u2019\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah discussed the news roiling Canadian politics: that Justin Trudeau has worn black or brown face on multiple occasions.\n\nFirst, Noah looked at the photo that kicked off the firestorm \u2013 a photo from an Arabian Nights party in 2001, in which Trudeau wore an Aladdin costume and dark brown makeup. \u201cThere\u2019s so many problems with this photo,\u201d Noah said. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s obviously never OK to do blackface. And secondly, if you are going to darken your skin, at least get the color right. Trudeau isn\u2019t dressed as Aladdin; he\u2019s dressed as Aladdin doing blackface.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Justin Trudeau\u2019s blackface and brownface photos make for the worst #tbt imaginable. pic.twitter.com/RZ3wDuptN2\n\nMoreover, \u201cTrudeau didn\u2019t need the blackface to make the costume work,\u201d Noah said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a full Aladdin outfit at an Arabian Nights themed party! No one was going to see him and be like, oh, white skin \u2013 are you the snowman from Frozen?\u201d\n\nAfter Time magazine first published the photo, Trudeau held a press conference to apologize, saying that he did not think it was racist at the time but now does, that he dresses overzealously for costume parties \u2013 and had also worn blackface for a costume in high school.\n\nThe revelation was rough, said Noah, and points to a larger issue. \u201cWhen you look at Trudeau and all these new stories of blackface every day, at some point we have to admit that this problem is bigger than some people want to believe.\u201d From Trudeau to the Virginia governor, Ralph Northam, to many, many frat party costumes, \u201cit seems that when white people get their hands on brown makeup, they just cannot help themselves,\u201d Noah said.\n\nWhich is why he proposed a \u201cbuyback program to get blackface off the streets\u201d. Noah also half-ironically suggested \u201cred flag laws \u2013 if you hear about your white friend talking about buying an afro wig for the school talent show, we need to stop that before it happens\u201d.\n\nFinally, he added: \u201cFor those people who already have a blackface photo that hasn\u2019t come out yet, we need to have one day of amnesty where you can put it out online without getting cancelled.\u201d\n\nBut the one day of amnesty was not a pass, he said. \u201cDon\u2019t use this as an excuse to make new blackface photos. I see you, white people.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts broke down the whistleblower complaint against Trump and Justin Trudeau\u2019s blackface revelations", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fcf8ac37c1e5eff75bcae433c947c8a2f131b6e/7_0_1525_915/master/1525.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=71cfd3a041f7e400b400c5879bec47b6", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
