He said they had seen the huge future of oil-gas in South Africa in the past 10 years and the country was potentially on the verge of something great.\n\nThere are a lot of people here who cannot get money from normal banks. I think to grow the South African economy it is important to understand what alternative sources of funding are there\n\nHe said Mozambique, for example, was likely to become one of the world\u2019s top three LNG players soon.\n\n\u201cTo date they [Mozambique] have attracted $50 billion of foreign direct investment. In five to 10 years\u2019 time that is going to be something like $120 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rise of the fourth industrial revolution\n\nProfessor Chris Adendorff from the Nelson Mandela University\u2019s Business School \u2013 referring to the fourth industrial revolution \u2013 said people should not be worried about robots dominating humanity as this was not likely to happen anytime soon.\n\n\n\nHe said the fourth industrial revolution was being driven by systematic transformation of technology information on a global scale and was not only affecting South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem we have as South Africans is that we think we are the world. This is actually happening on a global scale,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the fourth industrial revolution was more than technology. It was also meant to have a positive effect on core industries, such as education, health and smart business.\n\nThe biggest problem we have as South Africans is that we think we are the world. This is actually happening on a global scale\n\nNelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani said the Eastern Cape \u2013 including the metro \u2013 was undoubtedly a leading player in the manufacturing sector.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to position ourselves at the forefront of manufacturing innovation and thereby provide rewarding and quality employment to our communities,\u201d said Bobani.\n\nAnton Roelofse, the regional general manager from Business Partners, a specialist company that finances smaller and medium-size enterprises, said on Thursday that his company financed companies from R500 000 to R50 million.\n\n\u201cOur business is very important in the context of this indaba in terms of access to funding. There are a lot of people here who cannot get money from normal banks. I think to grow the South African economy it is important to understand what alternative sources of funding are there,\u201d said Roelofse.\n\nHe said small, medium and micro-size enterprises (SMMEs) were critical in creating jobs.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t see how big business is going to grow jobs into the future. I think SMMEs are going to become increasingly important for South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe have seen that in the rest of Africa the SMME sector is the one driving employment and wealth creation,\u201d he said.", "description": "The chief executive of the SA Oil and Gas Alliance believes the Nelson Mandela Bay area in the Eastern Cape has an opportunity to create either an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d or a really fantastic future, based on the oil and gas industry.", "authors": ["Lubabalo Ngcukana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/61df6bee4eb84afd92d551ac08934590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
