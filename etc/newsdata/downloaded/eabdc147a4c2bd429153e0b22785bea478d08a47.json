On Tuesday, the Verge released an audio recording of the Facebook chief executive talking to employees in a closed-door Q. and A. session. Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s frank words were not meant for public consumption.\n\nMs. Warren, the intense and substantive politician who has morphed into the Teddy Roosevelt of the digital age, is clearly top of mind for Silicon Valley\u2019s man-boy king. From the sound of it, she really, really bugs him. Consider this stemwinder from Mr. Zuckerberg, someone who usually is at a loss for words:\n\nSo there might be a political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they\u2019re not being handled well. That doesn\u2019t mean that, even if there\u2019s anger and that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies \u2026 I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in when you\u2019re, you know, I mean \u2026 it\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\n\nThis scoop was a favor to all of us for allowing a glimpse at what Mr. Zuckerberg truly thinks and says when he is comfortable and voluble at his fanciful park-topped headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\n\nUsually, we see him when duded-up in coat and tie and an awkward plastered-on smile under klieg lights at a hearing room on Capitol Hill, a situation that seems to render him incapable of saying anything that is not anodyne. Yes, Senator. No, Congressman. I\u2019ll get my staff to get back to you on that, Mr. Chairman.", "description": "He puts on a good front in Washington.
