Now 145 more companies are following.", "language": "en", "text": "When Walmart's CEO Doug McMillon sent a message about an issue as volatile as gun control, the country took notice.\n\nBut it's important to appreciate the complex factors involved in motivating such a move. Martin Whittaker, CEO of the ethical business analyst group JUST Capital, said that there tend to be three factors behind a corporate gesture like this: Company principles, stakeholders, and leadership.\n\n\"They're not saying, Guns and gun violence are against our values,\" Martin Whittaker, CEO of JUST Capital, told Business Insider.\n\n\"They've said, 'This is a real problem for our stakeholders, and we feel like we need to take a stand,'\" explained Whittaker, whose group had recently ranked companies for parental leave policies and their overall \"just\" quality.\n\nThe Walmart news follows an announcement from the Business Roundtable, an association of the CEOs of some of the largest companies, in which 181 CEOs acknowledged that the purpose of a company extends beyond benefitting its shareholders. Instead, companies exist for the \"benefit of all stakeholders - customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\"\n\nAnd on Thursday, the heads of some 145 more companies \u2014 from Levi Strauss to Uber \u2014 have signed their names onto a letter to the Senate requesting stricter gun control, per Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times.\n\nRead more: 181 CEOs of public companies, including Apple, JPMorgan Chase, and Walmart, have declared a company's purpose is to serve more than just shareholders\n\nIt's indicative of what Business Insider calls Better Capitalism\u2014 companies waking up to their impact.\n\nAs Whittaker explained, Walmart's actions on guns \u2014 and socially conscious moves like it \u2014 aren't the result of pure idealism. Instead, the needs of customers, employees, and the community, the stakeholders that Walmart has to consider, catalyzed the move for change. And indeed, since the announcement, the market has treated Walmart well, with shares rising to an all-time high the day after the announcement.\n\nRead more: Walmart hits a record high after announcing major overhauls to its gun policies\n\nBut, Whittaker says, if a major organization like Walmart is going to take a stand, it's because of three different pressures coming together \u2014 stakeholders, values, and leadership.\n\nStakeholders: the people most involved, namely customers.\n\nA recent Insider poll found that more than 60% of Americans support Walmart's decision: 39% agreed with the statment \"I support Walmart's decision, and I believe the company was acting in good faith,\" while 23% concurred with \"I support Walmart's decision, but I believe it was for publicity.\" The poll was from a national sample of respondents balanced by census data of age and gender. More than 1,000 opinions were collected from September 6 to September 7, 2019.\n\nRead more: A majority of Americans support Walmart's entry into the national gun debate, even if they think the company was motivated by publicity\n\nSo a major stakeholder, the customers themselves, indicate support for Walmart's decision, regardless of how they perceive the company's motives. Further, Gallup and Pew Research polls have also found that around 60% of Americans are in favor of stricter gun control measures.\n\nWhittaker explained that when companies see that a social issue really impacts their stakeholders, they tend to take action.\n\n\"We saw that with Walmart, when it affects their customers, when their employees and their customers don't feel safe at work, that's a real problem,\" Whittaker said. \"And that's one of the reasons why they were respectfully asking, even in open carry states, that people not do that in their stores.\"\n\nValues: The North Star that guides action.\n\nBusinesses have to know their stakeholders to best determine the impact of a politically divisive decision. They also have to determine if their company's core values align with the best course of action.\n\n\"I think without core values as a North Star, it's very difficult to know how to serve your stakeholders well,\" Whittaker said.\n\nWhittaker has been down to Bentonville, Arkansas, where Walmart is headquartered, and he affirms that Walmart does have a set of core principles. According to Walmart, they include: Service to the customer, respect for the individual, strive for excellence and act with integrity. These overarching principles encompass any sort of corporate action.\n\nStated values, of course, are no guarantee of ethical behavior: Enron declared its values to be Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. Then it became a byword for systematic corporate fraud.\n\nLeadership: Companies can choose to pave the way or follow the example of others.\n\nFinally, companies choose whether they want to lead or follow on social issues. That's the third element: leadership or the role that the company plays when it comes to taking a stand or making a social statement.\n\nCompanies are increasingly aware that the private sector has a part to play when it comes to social issues. The Business Roundtable statement affirms that. At the same time, the social and political backlash directed at Walmart's statement was inevitable. They moved forward with changes based on the interest, mainly safety, of their stakeholders, but they did so at a potential cost. This demonstrates that within the narrative of change, some companies will want to lead and take that risk, and some will want to follow.\n\n\"That's fine, that's almost inevitable,\" Whittaker said.\n\nIt's one thing to follow, and another thing to have the confidence and willingness to lead, he says.", "description": "Companies decide to take a stance at the danger of alienating some customers because of three factors: principles, stakeholders, and leadership.", "authors": ["Sherin Shibu"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d39cc818813a25c8b2314a9-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
