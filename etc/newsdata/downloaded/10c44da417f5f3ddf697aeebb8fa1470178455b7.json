I asked him how he was settling in. \u201cThis is great!\u201d he replied. \u201cI mean, everybody told me I was going to hate it here.\u201d\n\nI confessed that I was among those who thought he might not enjoy being the 97th most senior member of the Senate.\n\n\u201cI think people forget I worked for 10 years as a management consultant,\u201d Romney said, referring to his time at Bain & Company. \u201cWhich meant I was able to make no decisions, I was able to get nothing done, and I had to try and convince people through a long process.\u201d In retrospect, it seems, he was destined for the U.S. Congress.\n\nRomney told me that he doesn\u2019t think much anymore about his 2012 defeat to Barack Obama. \u201cMy life is not defined in my own mind by political wins and losses,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, I had my career in business, I\u2019ve got my family, my faith\u2014that\u2019s kind of my life, and this is something I do to make a difference. So I don\u2019t attach the kind of\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014psychic currency to it that people who made politics their entire life.\u201d\n\nNot everyone he\u2019s met in the Senate shares this outlook, he said. \u201cPeople are really friendly, they\u2019re really nice\u2014except Bernie,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s a curmudgeon. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s mean or whatever; he just kind of scowls, you know\u201d\u2014Romney hunched his back and summoned a Scrooge-like grunt. \u201cFor Bernie, it seems like this is kind of who he is. It\u2019s defining. It\u2019s his entire person. For me, it\u2019s part of who I am, but it\u2019s not the whole person.\u201d\n\nAfter he was elected in November, Romney began typing out a list on his iPad of all the things he wanted to accomplish in the Senate. It was 50 items long by the time he showed it to his staff, and though they laughed, he continued undeterred. By the time we spoke, it had grown to 60, with priorities ranging from complex systemic reforms\u2014overhauling the immigration system, reducing the deficit, addressing climate change\u2014to narrower issues such as compensating college athletes and regulating the vaping industry.\n\nAs he searched the Senate for legislative partners, Romney told me, he was warned that his efforts were likely doomed. Even in less polarized, less chaotic times, the kind of ambitious agenda he had in mind would be unrealistic. But Romney was steadfast in his optimism. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say it can\u2019t happen,\u201d he told me.\n\nWhen I broached the subject of Trump that afternoon in June, Romney\u2019s face didn\u2019t register the familiar mix of panic and dread that most GOP lawmakers exhibit these days when faced with questions about the president. If anything, he seemed a little bored by the topic. I had heard repeatedly from people close to Romney that his decision to run for Senate was motivated in part by his alarm at Trump\u2019s ascent. But he still seemed to believe that he could illuminate a path forward for his party without incessantly feuding with the president. \u201cI\u2019m not in the White House,\u201d he told me. \u201cI tried for that job; I didn\u2019t get it. So all I can do from where I am is to say, \u2018All right, how do we get things done from here?\u2019\u201d", "description": "The newly rebellious senator has become an outspoken dissident in Trump\u2019s Republican Party, just in time for the president\u2019s impeachment trial.", "authors": ["Mckay Coppins"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Mitt_Romney_Landscape/facebook.jpg?1571543815", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
