Who goes to an awards ceremony and finds a husband? That was me!\n\n'Neither of us were even meant to go and I was late after hosting The One Show. So when we are there now we do have a celebratory glass of champagne. It\u2019s a special evening for us.'\n\nDoting parents: The presenter, 40, also sweetly admitted that their baby daughter Patricia has 'completed' them as she spoke about her family in a candid interview (pictured after her birth in September 2018)\n\nChristine and Frank welcomed their first child together, a daughter called Patricia named after his late mother who tragically passed away in 2008, in September 2018.\n\nFrank also has daughters - Luna, 14, and Isla, 12, with his former partner Elen Rivas they split in 2008.\n\nTalking about her daughter, Christine gushed to the publication: 'We were already really happy but I suppose it does complete things.

And I\u2019ve gone up a shoe size since I had her! I could do more to try to trim myself back in, but I don\u2019t care.'\n\nAfter years of being pressured to start a family, Christine hit back: 'I didn\u2019t give a s**t [about the pressure]. I just never got why it was a question. Whose business is it?

Unless you\u2019re within a really close circle, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.'", "description": "The presenter,\u00a040, also sweetly admitted that their baby daughter Patricia has 'completed' them as she spoke about her family in a candid interview.", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/11/20212748-0-image-a-59_1572084729361.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
