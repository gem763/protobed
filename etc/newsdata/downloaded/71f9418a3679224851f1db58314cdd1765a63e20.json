As Hollywood cashes in on \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cToy Story,\u201d and \u201cFast and Furious\u201d sequels and remakes, technology companies are following a similar path.\n\nIn 2017, Nintendo released its Super NES Classic Mini. Sega's Genesis Mini comes out Sept. 19. Now Sony wants to join the trend, announcing a 40th anniversary Walkman called the NW-A100TPS.\n\nThere are no cassette tapes here, but with the 40th anniversary Walkman you\u2019ll get high-resolution audio, 26 hours of battery life, Bluetooth compatibility and an Android operating system. Sony unveiled its retro-inspired device Thursday at the IFA technology conference in Berlin.\n\nSony\n\n\u201cNot everything was better back then, so you can enjoy the best of both worlds with the heritage design of Walkman whilst having cutting edge technology at your fingertips,\u201d Sony said in a press release. \u201cYou can also enjoy a cassette tape user interface that takes inspiration from classic Walkman models.\u201d\n\nSony\u2019s 40th anniversary Walkman does not currently have a U.S. release date or price point. However, Sony announced that the device comes out in Europe in December and will cost 440 euros, which is about $489.\n\nThe new retro device supports both downloaded and streaming music. Its storage is minimal -- 16GB -- but it sports a microSD card slot so you can boost your device\u2019s memory.\n\nSony\n\nThe device also has an \u201cold-school\u201d cassette screensaver that changes color based on what music you\u2019re jamming out to, according to Gizmodo.\n\nThe NW-A100 comes in red, orange, ash green, blue and black and features a small 3.6-inch touchscreen. For comparison, the iPhone XS has a 5.8-inch screen and Samsung\u2019s new Galaxy Note 10 has a 6.3-inch screen.\n\nSony's first Walkman launched in July 1979 and became a revolutionary portable music device.", "description": "Sony announced a 40th anniversary Walkman this week at the IFA technology conference in Berlin.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/walkman-01-as-ht-190907_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
