The prime minister has said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than seek an extension, but he now appears to be left with little other choice outside of breaking the law.", "description": "The prime minister is bound by law to seek a Brexit extension from the EU if a deal is not reached next month.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/4D4P6eTQrKdwENlekQQv0h0UOZQ=/0x0:2200x1238/1920x1080/2019/09/09/1568059387093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
