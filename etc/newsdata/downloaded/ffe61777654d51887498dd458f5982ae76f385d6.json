(Bill Kostroun/AP)\n\nColumnist\n\nBy conservative NFL standards, it already has been a season of team-building madness. More players than usual have forced trades and staged holdouts for new contracts. More teams than usual have chosen proactive rebuilding \u2014 or outright tanking \u2014 over delusional early-season optimism.\n\nAs much as the Antonio Brown tornado seemed an aberrational disaster, it was really the most obnoxious manifestation of this new time in a changing sport. Not even the NFL, perhaps the most methodical of all professional leagues, is immune to a few factors that have altered how teams are built throughout sports: the young athlete\u2019s impatience; his increased understanding of how to acquire power and leverage; teams struggling to maintain control; and the social media-obsessed public\u2019s thirst for drama, speculation and frequent breaking-news transactions.\n\nRight now, the NFL isn\u2019t a place for standing pat. You witnessed it early in the offseason, when the Cleveland Browns traded for Odell Beckham Jr. and proceeded to build a star-studded roster. You witnessed it during the Brown debacle. You witnessed it during a series of trades as the regular season began, the kind of blockbuster moves that seldom happen so close to show time.\n\nSo, with the Oct. 29 trade deadline only three weeks away, you should expect the movement to continue. It would be disappointing if it doesn\u2019t. There are still plenty of disgruntled players, and the first third of the season has presented the best kind of parity, with a clear line separating a large group of contenders from the teams that can\u2019t even pretend to have hope. It sets up an intriguing last call to improve, on multiple levels.\n\n[John Clayton: Ranking the playoff contenders in a wide-open, deep NFC]\n\nThe teams that have a chance can ponder adding impact players in a quality market that could include big names such as Jacksonville cornerback Jalen Ramsey, Washington left tackle Trent Williams and Minnesota wide receiver Stefon Diggs. And the hopeless \u2014 there are four winless teams and four with a single victory through five weeks \u2014 can be motivated sellers at a time in which they could receive good returns for players they need to consider trading to rebuild.\n\nIf teams are cooperative and don\u2019t outsmart themselves, the conditions are favorable for a trade deadline that could be as close as the NFL can get to resembling the in-season transactions of the NBA or Major League Baseball.\n\nOf course, it is always more difficult to make trades in the NFL because of its hard salary cap, which is why trade deadline activity will never truly rival those other leagues. But teams are managing the cap more creatively than in the past, and almost all of them focus on maintaining the flexibility to make big moves when they\u2019re available.\n\nPlenty of teams should be thinking they are one big move away from doing something special. The start of this season has been interesting. The AFC remains top heavy, with New England (5-0) and Kansas City (4-1) looking like the only true championship contenders right now. But there are teams that appear on the rise (Buffalo, Baltimore and Cleveland chief among them), and if they were to add talent, it wouldn\u2019t have to be a win-now Hail Mary. They can play for now and later, and that\u2019s when giving up significant draft assets makes sense in a trade.\n\nOn the other hand, the NFC is wide open. New Orleans (4-1) has been the most impressive team because of its resilience in winning without Drew Brees and the depth and balance it has shown. Seattle and Green Bay are somewhat surprising at 4-1. San Francisco (4-0) is improving right on schedule. Dallas and Philadelphia are 3-2, and while they have shown some warts, they remain dangerous. And we have yet to talk about the defending NFC champion Los Angeles Rams, or the Chicago Bears and the Minnesota Vikings, both recent playoff teams with imposing defenses.\n\nIf there is a frenzy at the trade deadline, the NFC probably will make the most noise. There are 10 teams in the conference that have shown some playoff chops, and you could make an argument for a few more. But how many of them could win it all? How do they match up against the Patriots, who have outscored opponents 155-34? How do they match up against the Chiefs, who are capable of putting up 40 points in any game?\n\nMost of the NFC contenders could use one more star to feel really good about themselves. Imagine if Philadelphia, Green Bay or Seattle could convince Jacksonville to trade the unhappy Ramsey. Or if the Vikings went hard after Williams to protect Kirk Cousins\u2019s blind side again.\n\nConsidering Minnesota\u2019s renewed dedication to a run-based approach, it wouldn\u2019t be outlandish if it explored a rare star-for-star swap and included Diggs, a Maryland native, in a deal for Williams. Diggs isn\u2019t going to be a 100-catch receiver again in Minnesota\u2019s new system. Despite being terrible, Washington has foolishly shown no interest in trading Williams, who would be a great fit in Minnesota whether the Vikings are running or passing, for a draft pick.\n\nThe Vikings would rather add talent than remix it, but they need a big change. And their current direction suggests that, if forced to choose, an elite offensive lineman would serve them better.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s still best to build through the draft. But teams should take calculated risks on occasion. This is one of those times when the market is great, and the competitive balance is ideal. You have to know when to strike, and everything about NFL business in 2019 indicates there are significant benefits to being aggressive.\n\nAs long as the risk doesn\u2019t involve signing Antonio Brown, it\u2019s okay to take a chance.\n\nMore NFL coverage:\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nFalcons Coach Dan Quinn now has the NFL\u2019s hottest seat\n\nSteelers\u2019 Mason Rudolph just \u2018wasn\u2019t there\u2019 after being knocked out cold by scary hit\n\nThe Redskins are starting over after firing Jay Gruden, but in what direction are they headed?", "description": "Vikings wide receiver Stefon Diggs for Redskins left tackle Trent Williams?
