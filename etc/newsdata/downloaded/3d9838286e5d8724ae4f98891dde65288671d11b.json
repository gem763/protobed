Anyone knows it\u2019s a negotiation. And I\u2019d rather be answering why it went on too long before the first game\u2014and got done\u2014than to be sitting there in the third game not having it done... I may be almost $100 million lighter, but I\u2019m happier.\u201d\n\nEzekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys on the sidelines at the NFL Pro Bowl Game at Camping World Stadium on Jan. 27, 2019 in Orlando, Fla. (Don Juan Moore/Getty Images) More\n\nZeke Elliott is far from the first star athlete to use his leverage as a way to hold out for a big new contract. But this situation was a compelling sign of a shift in power in the way NFL contracts get hammered out: star players are no longer afraid to create a spectacle, anger team management, and even miss playing time in order to get the largest sum they can.\n\nDefensive end Jadeveon Clowney did the same to the Houston Texans, and got his money from the Seattle Seahawks. Running back Le\u2019Veon Bell did the same to the Pittsburgh Steelers and missed an entire season to prove a point, then got his money from the New York Jets.\n\nIn the NFL, player salaries are not guaranteed. (An NBA or MLB star who gets hurt can sit on the sidelines for an entire season and still get paid.) Team owners like Jones have the power. But stars like Elliott are proving that the power dynamic can reverse when a team is up against a corner.\n\nThe Cowboys set a record with Elliott\u2019s contract, making him the highest-paid running back ever, just one month after Cowboys COO Stephen Jones said on Dallas radio: \u201cWe\u2019re damn sure not going to be a market-setter.\u201d\n\nThe current NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement expires after the 2020 season.\n\n\u2014\n\nDaniel Roberts is the sports business writer at Yahoo Finance.
