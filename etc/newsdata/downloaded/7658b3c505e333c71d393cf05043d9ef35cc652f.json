This version is a side dish for the American summer, when corn and grilling are both in season. The cobs are slicked with butter and sparked with chile heat; in South Africa, they would be served alongside a pile of charcoal-grilled lamb chops or steak or giant prawns, or all of the above. For a more rustic effect (and more effort), use the corn husks as a wrapper instead of aluminum foil. Soak the unshucked cobs in cold water for at least 15 minutes. Peel back the husks but do not detach them from the cobs; remove all the cornsilk. After rubbing on the butter, rearrange the husks around each cob and tie in place with twine.\n\nFeatured in: South Africa, One Nation United By The Grill.\n\nLearn: How to Grill", "description": "In South Africa, charred ears of corn (called braai mielies) are year-round, smoky-sweet roadside snacks This version is a side dish for the American summer, when corn and grilling are both in season The cobs are slicked with butter and sparked with chile heat; in South Africa, they would be served alongside a pile of charcoal-grilled lamb chops or steak or giant prawns, or all of the above", "authors": ["Julia Moskin", "David Tanis", "Mark Bittman", "The New York Times", "Sam Sifton", "Melissa Clark"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/dining/25AFRICA-SPICY-BUTTERED-CORN/25AFRICA-SPICY-BUTTERED-CORN-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-25"}
