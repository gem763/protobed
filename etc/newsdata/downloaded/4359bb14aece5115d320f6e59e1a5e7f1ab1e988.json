This was at a time when the president was being criticized by some on the left as well as the right for not reacting more forcefully to the shoot-down of an American drone.\n\nAs it turns out, the administration was conducting a cyber attack as I was writing. Although the Pentagon did not announce it at the time, both The New York Times and The Washington Post have reported a successful cyber attack on Iran\u2019s data base used to target oil tankers. It would appear to confirm speculation that there is a Trump Doctrine in play, and that it is working.\n\nFor some months now, the has been speculation \u2014 including in this newspaper \u2014 that there is an unannounced Trump Doctrine. It now appears that the studied ambiguity of the president\u2019s approach to both Iran and China has teeth and that it is using all elements of national power rather than simply employing kinetic means or threatening force. Briefly explained, the Trump Doctrine appears to be aimed at addressing specific bad behaviors by specific bad actors rather than pursuing regime change or blind support for democratization in places where it clearly won\u2019t work anyway.\n\nIn the case of Iran, President Trump desires stricter guarantees of nuclear non-proliferation and a cessation of Iran\u2019s destabilizing actions in the Middle East. Regarding China, Mr. Trump wants Beijing to cease predatory economic and trade practices, and an end to its bullying behavior in the South China Sea. The Pandora\u2019s Box of a nuclear North Korea is open, but Mr. Trump wants its capability frozen at current levels so Pyongyang does not pose an existential threat to the United States. The president also wants Mexico to limit Central American immigrant pressure on the southern U.S. border.\n\nThe Obama, Bush (I&II) and Clinton administrations all had similar goals regarding China, Iran and North Korea that remained unmet; the issues with Mexico toward Central American immigration are relatively new, but control of the Mexican border dogged Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessors as well. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will succeed where previous presidents have failed, but his approach is certainly unique. Trump critics believe that unique is necessarily bad; time will tell.\n\nAlthough each case is slightly different, a clear pattern is emerging. First, there is a reliance on economic sanctions designed to lead to negotiations. Second, there is a military component that stresses the American ability to use force if necessary, but not to overreact to relatively minor provocations. Finally, there is a carrot and stick approach, and a clear off ramp from confrontation is available to each party in question. In the case of each of the four nations involved, all elements of national power (diplomatic, information, military and economic) are applied in some manner. In all cases, the Trump administration has signaled a readiness to take a long-term approach rather than use immediate military means excepting egregious provocations. The cyber attack represents merely a new non-kinetic screw to turn in implementing the doctrine of containing specific bad behaviors.\n\nIf a Trump Doctrine exists, it is a transactional, negotiated and non-ideological approach to specific national security problems. If the Mexicans can reduce Central American pressure on the U.S. southern border combined with a verifiable end to further North Korean nuclear and long-range missile testing, Mr. Trump\u2019s approach will have paid off fairly well. A negotiated end to trade differences and Chinese bullying in the South China Sea would earn the president an \u201cA\u201d in foreign policy. A truly verifiable nonproliferation agreement with Iran would be icing on the cake.\n\nMr. Trump has shown good judgment in not tilting at windmills in situations where he cannot win. Hong Kong is a case in point. The president made it clear that \u2014 however sympathetic we may be to the democracy movement \u2014 Hong Kong is an internal Chinese issue not tied to trade or the South China Sea. The president has also signaled that, despite providing lethal aid to the Ukraine, he clearly sees no national interest in a new Cold War with Russia.\n\nSome past doctrines \u2014 notably those of James Monroe, Teddy Roosevelt and Harry Truman \u2014 have worked while others have not. A successful Trump Doctrine would one-up Barack Obama\u2019s advice to his own country by telling the world\u2019s bad actors to \u201cstop doing stupid stuff.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Gary Anderson lectures in Alternative Analysis at the George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
