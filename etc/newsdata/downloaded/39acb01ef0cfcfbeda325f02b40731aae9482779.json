PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - The Tampa Bay Rays are disappointed, though hardly discouraged.\n\nThe overachieving franchise with baseball\u2019s smallest payroll returned home from losing to the Houston Astros in the AL Division Series confident that getting its first taste of postseason success since 2013 will make it stronger moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe would have loved to be World Series champs, but reaching the ALDS for the first time in six years is a right step forward,\u201d defensive whiz Kevin Kiermaier said.\n\n\u201cYou hate seeing it end right now, but at the same time, you think about Day 1 spring training, we accomplished most of our goals,\u201d the center fielder added. \u201cWe didn\u2019t finish where we wanted to, but at the same time \u2026 what a fun year.\u201d\n\nAfter compiling the best record among major league teams failing to make the playoffs in 2018, the Rays improved from 90 to 96 victories this season to make the playoffs for the fifth time in club history. They beat Oakland in last week\u2019s wild-card game, then survived two more elimination games to force a decisive Game 5 against the heavily-favored Astros in the ALDS.\n\nNot bad for a budget-minded franchise that ended the season with a payroll of just over $66 million.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d make the argument we were as fun a team to watch over 6 \u00bd months as any team in baseball,\u201d manager Kevin Cash said.\n\n\u201cWe may have surprised a lot of people, but we didn\u2019t surprise ourselves,\u201d second baseman Joey Wendle said. \u201cI think from Day 1, we had a lot of confidence in each other.\u201d\n\nThe Rays won 11 of 14 games to begin the season and went a franchise-best 17-8 in September to finish with 90-plus victories for the seventh time since 2008. The Los Angeles Dodgers (eight), New York Yankees (seven) and Boston Red Sox (seven) are the only other teams that have done that as often over that 12-season stretch.\n\nThey did it despite injuries sidelining Tyler Glasnow and 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell for big chunks of the year. Only three players - pitcher Charlie Morton, shortstop Willy Adames and outfielder Tommy Pham - remained on the active roster the entire season.\n\nThe Rays only have three players - Avisail Garcia, Travis d\u2019Arnaud and Eric Sogard - eligible for free agency.\n\n\u201cThis is a great taste for a lot of our guys of what\u2019s to come in the future, and we want everyone to remember what it\u2019s like to take that field in the postseason,\u201d Kiermaier said. \u201cHopefully that drives guys in the offseason, motivates them, whatever you want to call it, and hopefully we\u2019re back again next year.\u201d\n\nWith a good shot at making a deep run, said Glasnow - the losing pitcher in Games 1 and 5 of the ALDS.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a really good team. I think the success we had this year proved to a lot of us how good we are,\u201d the 26-year-old right-hander said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a big step, but I think too just being in the big leagues one year longer, everyone has got the experience. We\u2019re all so young. I think even if we have the exact same team, we\u2019re going to go really far next year.\u201d\n\nSome things to know about Tampa Bay\u2019s first playoff season in six years:\n\nIMPRESSIVE ARMS\n\nDespite using a team-record 33 pitchers, the Rays led the AL with a 3.65 ERA. The bullpen was exceptional, leading led the majors with a 3.66 ERA, and the club\u2019s starting pitchers ranked second in the AL - fourth overall - at 3.64. Tampa Bay pitchers also finished among the leaders in strikeouts with a club-record 1,621 - third in the majors behind Houston (1,671) and Boston (1,633).\n\nHOME VS. ROAD\n\nThe Rays went 48-33 at home, including 15-2 after Aug. 20. They also won 48 on the road, setting a club record. They were 2-8 at Yankee Stadium against the AL East champions but offset their problems there by going 8-1 at Fenway Park.\n\nONE-RUN GAMES\n\nThe Rays had one of baseball\u2019s best records in close games, going 23-16 in one-run games and 11-8 in extra innings. They finished the season with a franchise-best eight-game winning streak in extra-innings games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Tampa Bay Rays are disappointed, though hardly discouraged.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Fred Goodall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/alds_rays_astros_baseball_56141_c0-158-3787-2367_s1200x700.jpg?1158b78d131bdb9acdc2e0dad8ea765b76924724", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
