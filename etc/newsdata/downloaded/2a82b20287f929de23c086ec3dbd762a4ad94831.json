Here\u2019s why.\n\nInsider Selling Far Greater\n\nA quick look at insider buying and selling of Advanced Micro Devices stock shows that there have been no insider buys on the open market over the past three and 12 months.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeanwhile, there have been 18 sells over the past three months for a total of 1.66 million shares. Over the past 12 months, there have been 55 sells on the open market for a total of 39.04 million shares.\n\nThere are many reasons why insiders sell a stock. There\u2019s only one reason they buy, because it\u2019s cheap.\n\nThe fact that insiders haven\u2019t bought one share of AMD stock on the open market should scare you, especially when you compare it to the insider buying and selling at its peers.\n\nInsider Buying and Selling \u2013 Past 12 Months\n\nCompany # of Buys # of Sells\n\nShares\n\nBought\n\nShares\n\nSold\n\nAMD 0 55 0 39,044,980 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) 5 106 32,159 491,317 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 26 50 1,642,184 2,266,839\n\nSource: Nasdaq.com\n\nI suppose you could argue that because the AMD stock price is the cheapest of the three stocks by dollar value, an insider would have to sell more shares to obtain the same amount of cash from a sale.\n\nHowever, if we use the midpoint between the three stocks\u2019 highs and lows over the past 52 weeks, you\u2019ll see that AMD insiders sold a lot more stock by dollar value.\n\nAMD midpoint = $25.86 * 39.04 million shares = $1.0 billion\n\nIntel midpoint = $50.98 * 491,317 shares = $25.0 million\n\nNvidia midpoint = $208.61 * 2.27 million shares = $472.9 million\n\nNvidia Insiders Did a Lot of Buying\n\nThe most interesting observation from the above data is that Nvidia insiders didn\u2019t sell nearly as much stock over the past 12 months as AMD insiders did when you factor in the buying.\n\nBased on Nvidia\u2019s midpoint for both buying and selling, Nvidia insiders on a net basis only sold $130.3 million of its stock; Intel insiders sold $23.4 million of its stock on a net basis and AMD insiders sold a whopping $1 billion.\n\nAny way you slice it, AMD insiders have been cashing in on their stock\u2019s massive gains in 2019.\n\nBut why no buying on the open market? Surely, if AMD stock is worth $40, insiders would be buying?\n\nNorthland Securities analyst Gus Richard has an outperform rating on AMD and a 12-month price target of $36.\n\nOf the 37 analysts covering AMD stock, only 13 have an overweight or buy rating with four either rating it underweight or sell. The vast majority (20) rate it a hold.\n\nAs for a target price, the high is $44, the low is $8, and the average is $32.63.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why insiders are doing zero buying and lots of selling.\n\nShould You Buy AMD Stock?\n\nIf you believe that insider buying is a sign that a stock is selling below its intrinsic value, as I do, you can\u2019t possibly think AMD is a value above $30.\n\nWithout any new catalysts on the horizon, you might want to wait until it\u2019s trading closer to its midpoint around $25.\n\nThe insiders probably will.\n\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post The Lack of Insiders Buying AMD Stock Should Scare You appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is having a great year in the markets with AMD stock up 64% year to date through September 10.
