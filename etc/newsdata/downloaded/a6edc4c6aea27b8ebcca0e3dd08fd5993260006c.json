The complaints, which were spurred by a petition sent by the Center for Auto Safety in March, allege that these cars apply their brakes \"in cases where there was no obstruction in the path of the vehicle,\" according to NHTSA. Nissan and NHTSA count at least 14 crashes and five injuries related to the complaints. So far, Nissan has considered the issue strictly as a \"performance update\" by issuing technical service bulletins\u2014at least three since January\u2014that pertain to reprogramming the radar control unit, according to the agency.\n\nCAS says the issue is safety related and should be conducted via a formal recall. If NHTSA concurs from its investigation\u2014which at this point does not declare that a defect exists\u2014 Nissan will be forced to recall these cars and repair them all. At least 553,860 cars are potentially affected. NHTSA said it is researching if Nissan's service bulletins\u2014which are only sent to dealers and then only performed if a customer complains of the specific problem\u2014are sufficient.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Late-model Rogue and Rogue Sport crossovers are under the agency's microscope after owners complained.", "authors": ["Clifford Atiyeh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FU4PK0BZ6Us9FuDkHXuR1w--~B/aD00MDA7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/856682f5c0dd35f739640a25ebf3d104", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
