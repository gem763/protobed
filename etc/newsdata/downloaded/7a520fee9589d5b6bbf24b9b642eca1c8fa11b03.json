He and his colleague Erdem Gul were charged with espionage and accused of being terrorists themselves, spending three months in prison before they were released on the orders of a Turkish constitutional court.\n\nDundar wisely departed for Germany after his release and lives there in exile. Turkish courts eventually changed their minds and retroactively sentenced him to 15 to 20 years in prison for espionage, while Gul was acquitted of his own charges. Turkey issued an arrest warrant for him in absentia and Erdogan demanded his extradition from Germany as a \u201cspy.\u201d\n\nDundar spoke with Kurdistan 24 news while visiting Washington, DC, to collect a Carnegie Endowment democracy award. He expressed grave doubts that Erdogan\u2019s government could be trusted to respect the Kurdish population of Syria or fight effectively against the Islamic State, pointing to his work at Cumhuriyet to illustrate that Turkey has used ISIS as an instrument of policy in Syria, and is currently allied with Syrian militia groups that are not easy to distinguish from ISIS militants themselves:\n\n\u201cThe only way to stop this bloodshed,\u201d Dundar said, is cooperation between Turks and Kurds against the terrorist group. \u201cThis is the only way to assure peace in Turkey and in the region,\u201d he continued, as he added, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to understand why we [Turks and Kurds] are fighting with each other.\u201d US President Donald Trump is counting on Turkey to prevent the re-emergence of the Islamic State, but asked if he thought Turkey would do so, Dundar thought not. \u201cTurkey has been hosting ISIS for years,\u201d he replied. \u201cEveryone knows it in the region.\u201d Turkey was \u201chosting them in different cities, ISIS headquarters,\u201d and \u201cthey were releasing their guerrillas,\u201d Dundar continued. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think the Turkish government is the best choice to get rid of ISIS.\u201d\n\nDundar said Erdogan invaded Syria primarily to goose his nationalist support at home because he faces stiff political challenges, both from within his AKP party and from competing parties of a more democratic bent, including the Kurd-friendly People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP).\n\n\u201cThe official narrative is that they are fighting against terrorism, PKK terrorism \u2013 but, I guess, Erdogan needed this war,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needed something to unify his supporters and enhance his own power, so declaring war is the best solution for him, unfortunately, but not for Turkey, not for us.\u201d\n\nKurdistan 24 bolstered Dundar\u2019s argument by interviewing some female ISIS suspects living in al-Hol, one of the camps in northeastern Syria menaced by the Turkish invasion. The ISIS brides applauded the incursion and said they expected to be freed by the Turks.\n\n\u201cGod willing, Turkey will help us to flee from here and go to Turkey,\u201d said one of the ISIS women, identified by Kurdistan 24 as a French national.\n\n\u201cWe heard that the Turkish army attacked Ain Issa, and our sisters who were detained there have escaped and they fled to Turkey,\u201d she added, referring to another camp.\n\n\u201cWe want Turkey to attack here. If the Turkish army comes to this area, I will be able to flee and meet my husband, who I know well is in Turkey,\u201d said another ISIS bride, this one from Russia.\n\nAl-Hol camp administrators told Kurdistan 24 that 600 of the 900 Kurdish YPG fighters who guarded the camp have been called away to fight the Turks and humanitarian organizations have also departed. The camp population is reportedly growing more unruly and has become fond of chanting \u201cthe slogans of the Islamic State and the caliphate\u201d at the remaining guards.\n\nAnother group alarmed by the Turkish invasion is the Yazidis, a small, frequently-persecuted, ethnically Kurdish religious minority.\n\n\u201cThe current events in northeastern Syria, if not halted, will annihilate Yazidis from their ancestral homeland in Syria, which will affect the historical presence of Yazidi in the Middle East, particularly their ancestral homeland in Iraq and Syria,\u201d said an open letter published by Yazidi activists and community leaders on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe call on the international community to take all necessary measures to halt all military operations in northeastern Syria. We also call for a political process in Syria that will ensure sustainable peace for all people of Syria, and that ethnic and religious components of Syria to be considered as an important factor in determining the future of Syria, including of the Yazidis,\u201d the letter said.", "description": "An exiled Turkish journalist accuses the Turkish government of \u201chosting ISIS for years\u201d and \u201creleasing their guerrillas\u201d from captivity.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-605841222-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
