It is specifically designed to evade western anti-missile defences.\n\nThe announcement that testing of the heavy land-based RS-28 Sarmat ICBM with payloads will begin next year is just another sign of the emphasis that President Vladimir Putin is placing on Russia's nuclear forces.\n\nWhile the US, too, has ambitious modernisation plans, it lags behind Moscow's comprehensive effort, with Mr Putin seeing his missile inventory as a key indicator of great power status.\n\nIt comes amid reports (in Russian) that Russia is preparing to conduct further tests early next year of its new liquid-fuelled Sarmat missile, commonly referred to as Satan 2, according to Russian business daily Vedomosti.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has previously said the Satan 2 has \"practically no range limits\".\n\nThe missile was one of six new Russian strategic weapons unveiled by Mr Putin in his annual state of the nation address to parliament in March 2018.", "description": "Footage shows a launch from an underwater position in the White Sea, Russia's defence ministry says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sh9zw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
