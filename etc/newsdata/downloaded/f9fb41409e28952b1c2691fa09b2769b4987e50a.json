But if it is well-attended several of those Tube stations could be shut, and the areas around them will be extremely busy.\n\nRoads will be closed making it difficult to arrive by bus.\n\nFor those outside London, the campaign is bussing people in on more than 170 coaches from as far afield as Inverness. See a full list here.\n\nWho are the speakers?\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSpeakers in Parliament Square are set to include, with more to be announced:\n\nSadiq Khan, Mayor of London\n\nCaroline Lucas, Green MP\n\nDavid Lammy, Labour MP\n\nJo Swinson, Lib Dem leader\n\nJoanna Cherry, SNP MP\n\nLiz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru Westminster leader\n\nAnna Soubry, Independent Group for Change leader\n\nWhy is the march happening?\n\n(Image: Dan Kitwood)\n\nOfficially, the march is not against Brexit in its entirety. Instead it is for a referendum, to give the people a final say on whether to leave the EU.\n\nHowever, most of the people who attend it are likely to back Remain, as are the vast majority of politicians who speak at it.\n\nOrganisers say: \"Can we allow Boris Johnson to force No Deal - or another vicious form of Brexit - on our country, without all of us having our voice heard?\n\n\"They can not, must not and will not force this broken Brexit on the British people without giving us the final say.\"\n\nWhat does Boris Johnson claim?\n\nThe Tory leader has viciously attacked people who call for a referendum. A No10 spokesman said: \"The zealots who are pushing for a second referendum aren't interested in defending democracy - they are seeking to overturn it.\n\n\"Their aim has always been to delay and block Brexit for as long as possible so they could artificially engineer a second referendum.\"\n\nWho is organising it?\n\nThe march is being organised by the People's Vote campaign, one of the most prominent of a chain of connected Westminster-based campaign groups for a referendum. The group has many of the same key figures as the original official campaign to remain in the EU.\n\nIt is part of the umbrella of Open Britain, whose directors include former Tony Blair ally Lord Mandelson, Tory Amber Rudd's brother Roland and Innocent drinks tycoon Richard Reed.\n\nWho is paying for it - and what are they paying for?\n\nThe People's Vote campaign has raised more than \u00a3500,000 in crowdfunding for the event.\n\nA detailed breakdown is not available, but organisers insist it is comprised of small donations from members of the public. They also say all the costs of the march have been or are being met through crowdfunding.\n\nThe money will go towards audiovisual equipment in Parliament Square and publicity material, including heavy advertising on social media.\n\nIt is also paying for public liability insurance, toilets, railings and other equipment, organisers say.", "description": "Tens of thousands of Brexit protesters are expected to attend the 'Together for the Final Say' march in the capital - here are the details", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Vickie Flores Epa-Efe Rex Shutterstock", "Dinendra Haria Wenn", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images", "Dan Kitwood"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article14175795.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Peoples-Vote-March-for-the-Future-demonstration-London-United-Kingdom-20-Oct-2018.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
