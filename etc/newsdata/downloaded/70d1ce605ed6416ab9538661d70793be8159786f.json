[SEOUL DESIGN FOUNDATION]\n\nThe Seoul Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020 is just around the corner, and this year\u2019s edition is bringing along with it a couple of major changes.During a press conference on Tuesday, Seoul Fashion Week\u2019s new director Jeon Mi-kyung introduced herself to the press for the first time in her role and discussed what to expect for the upcoming fashion extravaganza. This season\u2019s event will run from Oct. 14 to 19 at the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in central Seoul.Jeon, who previously served as the editor-in-chief of Harper\u2019s Bazaar Korea, said that she is focused on strengthening media exposure of the event through a new partnership with U.S. fashion media outlet WWD, or Women\u2019s Wear Daily.\u201cOne of the reasons why BTS could succeed is that they did a really good job at online PR [public relations],\u201d she said. \u201cWe also plan on strengthening our digital presence beginning this season by collaborating with WWD, which will distribute special edition publications of the event and post reviews of shows in real time.\u201dJeon also emphasized the importance of attracting buyers from Asia and the Middle East, who she said are responsible for the most actual purchases made during Fashion Week. A record 135 buyers were invited this season from those regions.In another big change, tickets for fashion shows this season have been made available for purchase online.\u201cIn the past, tickets for shows were managed by designers, making it difficult for regular people to view a show if they didn\u2019t have direct contact with the designer,\u201d said Kim Su-jeong, head of the fashion team at Seoul Design Foundation, a government-affiliated body that oversees the event.\u201cWe decided to sell tickets not for revenue, but to provide equal opportunity for people studying or just interested in fashion.\u201dAround 25 to 45 seats per show will be made available to the public. Tickets will go on sale from Monday at booking site Interpark for 10,000 won ($8.30) each. Proceeds from ticket sales will be given to the designers.Fashion week events will kick off on Oct. 14 with an opening reception at an archival exhibition of works by Sul Yun-hyoung, one of Korea\u2019s leading designers.A total of 34 fashion shows by designers such as Greedilous and D.Gnak will hit the runways across three venues at the DDP. The Generation Next Seoul trade show will carry items from over 120 brands.Following a show from the label Cottweiler from last season, British designer Ashley Williams will be holding a show at 6:30 p.m. on Oct. 18 as part of a designer exchange program fueled by an ongoing partnership between the British Fashion Council and the Seoul Design Foundation.Those who can\u2019t get tickets to the shows will still be able see and do many things at the DDP. Sul Yun-hyoung\u2019s exhibition will be open to the public for free from Oct. 15 to Nov. 7 at the DDP\u2019s Design Pathway, and a Sustainable Fashion Summit featuring fashion experts and designers will run from Oct. 16 to 17.
