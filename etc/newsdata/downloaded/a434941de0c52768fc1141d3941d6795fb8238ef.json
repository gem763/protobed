So how did the Chicagoan become one of conscious rap\u2019s strongest voices?\n\nIt\u2019s apt that Common and I meet in Philadelphia, the US city of brotherly love. The rapper, who is also an activist and Emmy-winning actor, has a preoccupation with the subject, which he believes should be the driving force behind personal and social change. \u201cMy mother\u2019s love was the first thing I pretty much knew,\u201d he says as we drive to the soundcheck for a gig. His new album, Let Love, his 12th, is full of lush, moving jazz and soul-tinged odes to life, hip-hop, his mother, his 22-year-old daughter, his hope for a future romantic relationship and to God.\n\nCommon, 47, speaks powerfully about his childhood, growing up on Chicago\u2019s notorious South Side. His parents split when he was a baby, but he maintained regular contact with his father, and his grandmother walked him to school. There he met Mr Brown, a teacher who \u201ctook a lot of pride in what it was to be a black man\u201d. Although the drugs and gangs that plagued the neighbourhood were close by, \u201cit wasn\u2019t like every day we were walking around dodging bullets,\u201d Common explains in a laid-back drawl. \u201cThe ultimate thing was that, man, I had something to aspire to. One of the solutions to the violence that goes on in the inner city is providing young people with something [that makes them] feel valued.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Common performing in Austin in August.

It depicted a less mature person, particularly on the misogynist track Heidi Hoe. \u201cI definitely put a lot of that down to youth,\u201d Common explains, sounding a bit embarrassed. \u201cIt was \u2018bros before hoes\u2019 \u2013 stuff you\u2019re repeating from your homies when you\u2019re not really thinking for yourself yet.\u201d\n\nAfter the album failed to achieve commercial success, he embarked on a journey of personal and spiritual growth. He read the Bible and the Qur\u2019an, listened to jazz and worked on his craft as an MC. Two years later, he came back with a critically acclaimed second album, Resurrection. It was \u201cas if Common had gone from playing dozens on the corner to standing in as an elder statesman\u201d, declared one critic. \u201c[He was] socially conscious, verbally dexterous and seemingly wise beyond his years.\u201d Clearly, his underwhelming experiences with his first album affected him. \u201cI named the album Resurrection because I felt like I was coming back from the dead,\u201d he says, with a deep belly laugh.\n\n\u201cMy ambition initially was driven by wanting to be seen, wanting to be heard \u2013 I wanted to be the dopest. But when I started writing stories about myself I would have people come to me and say, \u2018Wow, your song Retrospect for Life [about abortion] made me decide to have my child.\u2019 When people start telling you how your music has affected them, you know that it has a higher purpose.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Common: Resurrection \u2013 video\n\nThe experience taught him that change doesn\u2019t happen unless you make it happen. He applied the same line of thinking to acting, which he began studying in 2001. He\u2019s appeared in more than 50 movies \u2013 including a role in Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma and in the next 10 years, he says: \u201cI want people to say, \u201cMan, he\u2019s one of the great actors of his generation.\u2019\u201d Calling acting enlightening and therapeutic, he says it has taught him that \u201cwhat\u2019s more important than being cool is telling the truth\u201d.\n\nThis might sound like so much celebrity puff, but Common credits acting with a profound late-in-life revelation. While filming The Tale, a film about sexual abuse starring Laura Dern, he recalled that he had been molested as a child by a male relative of a family friend. Common opens up easily about the recollection: \u201cIt was something I had removed from my thoughts, but through being part of the movie, the situation came to my memory. As a kid I must have felt, \u2018I don\u2019t want nobody to know about this, I don\u2019t wanna get in trouble or get this person in trouble\u2019, so I just didn\u2019t let it exist in my mind.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Common with Democratic party politician Stacey Abrams at a rally in 2018.

He felt it was vital he share his story so that \u201canybody who has experienced [abuse] can feel they don\u2019t have to carry the shame and can figure out a way to get past it and heal\u201d.\n\nThe topic of healing weighs heavily on the rapper\u2019s mind these days, especially when it comes to race, poverty and US politics. \u201cThere has to be a shift in values,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat can we offer our communities to provide people not only with hope but with practical ways to advance and live a full life?\u201d\n\n50 great tracks for September from Normani, Tinariwen, Miley Cyrus and more Read more\n\nMore than a decade ago, he created the Common Ground Foundation, which focuses on empowering high-school students from underserved communities. It is about to open the Art in Motion charter school in Chicago. He is also involved in criminal justice reform initiatives. Since 2017, he has toured California prisons, talking to and performing for inmates. His efforts have been credited with helping pass a bill in California that allows young offenders sentenced to life without parole the opportunity to have their cases reheard.\n\nSitting on his tour bus after his show, Common sips on red wine while showing a friends the video for Show Me You Love, a song about how his relationship with his daughter has evolved. A few years ago, she told she didn\u2019t think he had been the best father \u2013 he was separated from her mother and away on tour all the time \u2013 and she felt that he didn\u2019t really care about her. At first, Common says, he was defensive, but then they started mending their relationship with the help of therapy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that people see there are artists out there who have achieved, but they still have issues they are working through,\u201d he says, explaining why he wants to reveal vulnerability in his music. \u201cThis is why I talk about therapy and mindfulness and meditation in my [new] songs. It\u2019s why I talk about being molested, and my father. The job of the artist is to not always show the accolades.\u201d", "description": "He got his start in the era of gangsta rap and admits to a \u2018bros before hoes\u2019 attitude early in his career.
