It\u2019s as if the whole effort is designed to confirm President Trump\u2019s complaint that the \u201cdeep state\u201d is determined to sabotage his presidency.\n\nBy \u201cdeep state,\u201d Mr. Trump seems to mean any current or former federal employee who works to undermine him. I find that definition too broad, and it misses an important distinction. Officials like James Comey and John Brennan, respectively former directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, were appointed by politicians and are subject to some public scrutiny and political accountability.\n\nThe \u201cdeep state\u201d\u2014if we are to use the term\u2014is better defined as consisting of career civil servants, who have growing power in the administrative state but work in the shadows. As government grows, so do the challenges of supervising a bureaucracy swelling in both size and power. Emboldened by employment rules that make it all but impossible to fire career employees, this internal civil \u201cresistance\u201d has proved willing to take ever more outrageous actions against the president and his policies, using the tools of both traditional and social media.\n\nGovernment-employed resisters received a call to action within weeks of the new administration. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates became acting attorney general on Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and Loretta Lynch\u2019s resignation. A week later, the president signed an executive order restricting travel from seven Middle Eastern and African countries. Ms. Yates instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the order in court on the grounds that she was not convinced it was \u201cconsistent\u201d with the department\u2019s \u201cresponsibilities\u201d or even \u201clawful.\u201d She decreed: \u201cFor as long as I am Acting Attorney General, the Department of Justice will not present arguments in defense of the Executive Order.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump fired her that day, but he shouldn\u2019t have had to. Her obligation was to defend the executive order, or to resign if she felt she couldn\u2019t. Nobody elected Sally Yates.\n\nThe Yates memo was the first official act of the internal resistance\u2014not only a precedent but a rallying cry. Subordinates fawningly praised her in emails obtained by Judicial Watch. \u201cYou are my new hero,\u201d wrote one federal prosecutor. Another department colleague emailed: \u201cThank you AG Yates. I\u2019ve been in civil/appellate for 30 years and have never seen an administration with such contempt for democratic values and the rule of law.\u201d Andrew Weissmann\u2014a career department lawyer, then head of the Criminal Fraud Division and later on the staff of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2014wrote: \u201cI am so proud. And in awe. Thank you so much.\u201d Ms. Yates set an example to rebels throughout the government: If she can defy the president, why can\u2019t I?\n\nThat mentality fed the stream of leaks that has flowed ever since. The office of Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, made a study of Mr. Trump\u2019s first 18 weeks in office. It found the administration had \u201cfaced 125 leaked stories\u2014one leak a day\u2014containing information that is potentially damaging to national security under the standards laid out in a 2009 Executive Order signed by President Barack Obama.\u201d Nearly 80% focused on the Russia probe, and many revealed \u201cclosely-held information such as intelligence community intercepts, FBI interviews and intelligence, grand jury subpoenas, and even the workings of a secret surveillance court.\u201d Unauthorized disclosure of classified information is a felony.\n\nEmployees also started using social media to \u201cresist.\u201d A National Parks Service employee had already used an official Twitter account to troll Mr. Trump, passing along a post that showed side-by-side comparison of the crowd at Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration and the larger one at Mr. Obama\u2019s. Around the time of the Yates firing, someone in the Pentagon set up the Twitter account @Rogue_DOD, on which was posted a damaging opinion piece about Trump and internal documents about climate change. A former employee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up @viralCDC, with the description: \u201cThe unofficial \u2018Resistance\u2019 page of the CDC.\u201d Its pinned tweet read: \u201cIf they choose to make facts controversial, the purveyors of facts must step into the controversy. #ScienceMarch #resist.\u201d\n\nThese details come from a Jan. 31, 2017, Washington Post story, which reported that \u201c180 federal employees have signed up for a workshop next weekend, where experts will offer advice on workers\u2019 rights and how they can express civil disobedience.\u201d The report added that some federal employees were in \u201cregular consultation with recently departed Obama-era political appointees\u201d about how to oppose the administration, while others were planning to \u201cslow\u201d their work if asked to focus on anything other than their policy \u201cmission\u201d as they understood it.\n\nAt the State Department, resisters organized a \u201ccable\u201d protesting Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban. It worked its way through dozens of U.S. embassies and ultimately had at least 1,000 signatures. The cable was part of a \u201cdissent channel\u201d that Foggy Bottom maintains to allow officials to disagree with policy, and it is meant to be confidential. The resisters made the letter public, bragging about the numbers of signers and anonymously slamming Mr. Trump. The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed State Department official: \u201cThere is overwhelming disgust and shock at this executive order.\u201d\n\nA former Obama assistant secretary of state, Tom Malinowski, acknowledged sarcastically that such a protest was unprecedented. \u201cIs it unusual?\u201d he said to the Post. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about the entire national security bureaucracy of the United States feeling like their commander in chief is a threat to U.S. national security. That happens all the time. It\u2019s totally usual. Nothing to worry about.\u201d (Mr. Malinowski is now a congressman from New Jersey.)\n\nMany Obama holdovers have openly worked to cause mayhem in the new administration. Consider Walter Shaub, whom Mr. Obama appointed in 2013 to run the Office of Government Ethics. That office isn\u2019t a watchdog. It doesn\u2019t adjudicate, investigate or prosecute ethics violations or complaints. It was set up in 1978 to help the White House; its webpage notes it is there to \u201cadvise\u201d and to \u201cassist\u201d the executive branch in navigating complex ethical questions.\n\nMr. Trump came to office with more such questions than most, and the Office of Government Ethics should have been a valuable resource. Instead, within weeks of the election, Mr. Shaub was mimicking the president-elect from an official Twitter account: \u201c@realDonaldTrump OGE is delighted that you\u2019ve decided to divest your businesses. Right decision!\u201d \u201c@realDonaldTrump Brilliant! Divestiture is good for you, very good for America!\u201d When Mr. Trump released his plan for his assets, Mr. Shaub blasted it at a public event with press in attendance.\n\nAt one point Mr. Shaub sent one of his critical missives to hundreds of government ethics officials, every inspector general, and the chairmen and ranking members of numerous congressional committees. When administration officials began to call him out on his behavior, he loudly resigned and immediately landed a job at the liberal Campaign Legal Center.\n\nBureaucrats also began filing official internal complaints, demanding to get to define their own policies and programs. In July 2017, an Interior Department employee named Joel Clement published a Washington Post op-ed titled \u201cI\u2019m a Scientist. I\u2019m Blowing the Whistle on the Trump Administration.\u201d He began his piece: \u201cI am not a member of the deep state.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he had just filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, a federal body that regulates and protects civil servants. For seven years Mr. Clement had worked at Interior, helping \u201cendangered communities in Alaska prepare for and adapt to a changing climate.\u201d Now he, along with more than two dozen other senior career Interior employees, had been reassigned to working in fossil fuels. He claimed this reassignment was retaliation \u201cfor speaking out publicly about the danger that climate change poses to Alaska Native communities.\u201d He called himself a \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d At least he put his name on the article.\n\nAlthough the law protects civil servants from being fired, departments have broad authority to reassign them. Setting policy priorities wasn\u2019t Mr. Clement\u2019s job. Yet his complaint inspired eight Senate Democrats to demand an Interior inspector general investigation. Notably, that 2018 report did not find evidence of Mr. Clement\u2019s charges of retaliation. As then-Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt noted, the department\u2019s actions were entirely \u201clawful.\u201d Mr. Clement in the fall of 2017 resigned with a much-publicized letter to then-Secretary Ryan Zinke: \u201cYour agenda profoundly undermines the DOI mission and betrays the American people.\u201d Mr. Clement is now a senior fellow at the left-wing Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nIn December 2017, such acts of defiance led the Atlantic to celebrate the \u201cYear of the Civil Servant.\u201d The article hailed the bureaucracy for toiling through \u201cthe president\u2019s chaotic first year in office.\u201d It saluted those who had fought against an administration that had made it \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for them to \u201cdo their jobs.\u201d\n\nBut the job of civil servants is to implement, not undermine, the policies established by elected officials. A government paycheck doesn\u2019t entitle them to call the shots. The bureaucratic resistance has used its power to delay and undermine Trump proposals, leak government information, gin up controversies to run Trump cabinet heads out of Washington\u2014and now provide an excuse for impeachment. Many call themselves whistleblowers, but that\u2019s a bastardization of an honorable word. Whistleblowers expose government fraud; resisters sabotage policy and attempt to undermine an elected government\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nGovernment workers are a vital part of society. Yet voters have become deeply suspicious\u2014and rightly so\u2014of the federal bureaucracy. That\u2019s damaging the country. Democrats insist they must remove Mr. Trump from office to save America\u2019s institutions and restore its norms. Who\u2019s doing the real damage to institutions and norms? The resistance should look in the mirror.\n\nMs. Strassel is the Journal\u2019s Potomac Watch columnist.
