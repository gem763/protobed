REUTERS/Benoit Tessier\n\nThe French brand, known for its larger-than-life sets popularised under late designer Karl Lagerfeld, is one of the last major labels on display as Paris Fashion Week comes to a close, along with LVMH\u2019s Louis Vuitton.\n\nAll eyes are on how Lagerfeld\u2019s successor Virginie Viard, who worked behind the scenes for many years at Chanel, will mark her stamp on the brand, after several months in the job.\n\nThe latest ready-to-wear collection, for next spring and summer, was decidedly youthful, with cropped, playsuit versions of its famed tweed suits setting the tone, and plenty of coral and red hues.\n\nKaia Gerber, the 18-year-old daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford, wore a short, flared white skirt paired with an off-the-shoulder, \u201cBrigitte Bardot-style\u201d tulle top and a kooky mini cowboy hat.\n\nRapper Cardi B and actress Isabelle Adjani were among celebrity guests looking on, as models showed off silver hotpants and dresses with Chanel logo patterns.\n\nLoyal Chanel clients, many of whom are invited to see the shows, had mixed views on its new designer\u2019s efforts so far.\n\n\u201cWhat Virginie Viard is doing is fresh and feminine,\u201d said one from Germany, adding she would happily don the shorts.\n\nAnother Israeli customer was less impressed, saying Chanel needed a creative chief with more of a \u2018wow\u2019 factor.\n\n\u201cIt was a little ordinary. (Founder) Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld had strong personalities, that\u2019s what this brand needs,\u201d she said.\n\nOne spectator, all decked out in Chanel, caused a small commotion at the end of the catwalk show by joining the models taking a last lap around the set, under the bemused smiles of other guests.", "description": "Chanel paraded its models along Paris' emblematic grey zinc rooftops for its fashion show on Tuesday, in an atmospheric recreation of the city's skyline complete with a brooding sky.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Pineau", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435872618&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902ON", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
