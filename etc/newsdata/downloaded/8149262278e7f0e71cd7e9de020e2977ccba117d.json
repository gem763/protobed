As ever, however, New Zealand remain the bookies' favourites, but will it be captain Kieran Read making it three victories in a row for the All Blacks on Saturday November 2?\n\nNew Zealand 5/6\n\nDespite a more temperate year by their own standards, New Zealand still possess ample class, and count some of the world's very best performers among their squad. The pool stage win against South Africa will have settled any pre-tournament doubts, despite giving them a tougher route through the knockout stages. They have handled it well thus far, however, with their trouncing victory of Ireland. Two tough games remain for them, however.\n\nSouth Africa 10/3\n\nRugby Championship winners for the first time since 2009, South Africa's squad is fearsome. They have strong depth in their rampaging forward pack; measured, pragmatic half-backs, and a punishing back-three. A pool-stage loss to New Zealand has given them a slightly easier draw, too. Following that slow-building, punch victory over Japan, Wales will have their work cut out in the semi-finals.", "description": "With the 2019 Rugby World Cup hurtling towards the semi-finals, Telegraph Sport takes a look at how the contenders are shaping up with the bookmakers.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport", "Mick Cleary", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan", "Danny Care", "Jamie Roberts", "Brian Moore", "Tom Cary"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-world-cup/2019/09/17/TELEMMGLPICT000128217451-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPuL-8ex6Wxr3HGFUi6PIc45tImKey5x700iKis9lGeo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
