The European-informed baking process for some styles takes as long as three days for the crew of self-professed \u201cbread geeks\u201d at El Horno de Pane, inside the Montemar Plaza shopping center. Try the monkey bread or pumpkin brioche French toast; eggs poached or scrambled served with ciabatta or sourdough; or peruse the irresistible danishes, croissants and other tempting baked goods. BTW: Don\u2019t let the inevitable crowd deter you; service is efficient. El Horno de Pane, Calle Juan Calaf, Hato Rey, San Juan Website 787-433-3441\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\nBreakfast Abracadabra Counter Cafe This Santurce restaurant\u2019s magic theme runs strong, down to its nostalgic carnival accents inside. On Saturdays and Sundays, the beloved \u201cMagic Brunch\u201d features offerings like veggie-packed omelets, fruit-and-Nutella pancakes, and croque madame or monsieur. Mimosas go beyond the typical orange juice (think passion fruit, tamarind, mango and acerola). Lunch offerings include wraps, panini and burgers, and on some occasions, breakfast is served all day. BTW: Abracadabra has a small stage and doubles as an arts and music venue.

Its classic tripleta sandwich is upgraded way past triple-meat status with steak, turkey, chorizo, pernil (roast pork) and more. And the bakery\u2019s staple sweets \u2014 pastelitos de guayaba (stuffed guava pastries), quesitos (a sticky, cream cheese-filled croissant) and doughnuts \u2014 are all made in-house. BTW: Those flags, banners, license plates and the kitschy signage all over the place? They\u2019re the owner\u2019s travel souvenirs.

Dishes, all of them health-conscious, range from Asian to criollo to Mediterranean. BTW: There are plenty of vegetarian-friendly options here. Omrkt, 166 Ave. Winston Churchill, San Juan Website 787-234-6544\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\nWebsite\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\nDinner La Placita de Santurce At this popular plaza, restaurants and bars are clustered around a daytime market. Highlights include the Cuban fare at Asere and the San Juan Smokehouse for barbecue. Nearby, Paxx Caraballo Moll, named one of Food and Wine Magazine\u2019s best new chefs of 2019, helms the kitchen at Jungle BaoBao, inside the neon, tiki-style bar JungleBird. BTW: La Placita gets busy as the night progresses, with dancing patrons spilling into the streets. Arrive early to eat; stay late for drinks and entertainment.

BTW: Lote 23 also hosts events, which it promotes on social media, such as yoga sessions, film screenings, artisans\u2019 markets and more. Lote 23, 1552 Ave. Ponce de Le\u00f3n, San Juan Location\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\nLate-night Los Pinos Quality comida criolla \u2014 or traditional local cuisine \u2014 such as arroz mamposteao (Puerto Rican rice and beans) or bolitas de yuca (fried yuca balls), is served 24/7 at this go-to cafe for late-night meals in the Miramar area. If you\u2019re looking to soak up too many Medallas (the popular local beer), though, go for the super-starchy mofongo (mashed plantains). BTW: Los Pinos has a full bar.
