USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2014 On Aaron Jones\u2019 first touchdown, he pointed up to the AT&T Stadium ceiling before gathering his teammates in the end zone, arms crossed, to mug for a cameraman.\n\n\u201cThis is my house,\u201d he exclaimed after his second touchdown advanced the Packers\u2019 rout of the Cowboys.\n\nBy his third, Jones was waving goodbye to Cowboys cornerback Byron Jones before he even broke into the end zone. Aaron Jones carried the ball with one hand while waving with the other, and still the defender couldn\u2019t catch him.\n\nSo by Jones\u2019 fourth touchdown, a one-yard punch up the middle, the Packers running back blew a kiss to the camera man. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers raised four fingers to count them off.\n\nAaron Jones eludes Cowboys CB Byron Jones, waves goodbye...\n\n\n\nPackers 24. Cowboys 0.pic.twitter.com/y2DaNNZPag \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 6, 2019\n\nThe Cowboys defense seemed unable to point even one finger at an answer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question we didn\u2019t tackle well,\u201d linebacker Sean Lee said. \u201cAll of us didn\u2019t tackle well. That\u2019s something we usually hang our hat on ... Just traditionally, that\u2019s what we do, but we didn\u2019t do it today.\u201d\n\nThe Cowboys\u2019 34-24 loss reads as much closer than how the game actually unfolded for most of Sunday afternoon. With 2:10 to play in the third quarter, the Cowboys trailed 31-3 in their own house. Jones had scored four touchdowns before the Cowboys scored one. And he became the first opponent in the 59-year Cowboys franchise history to gash Dallas for four rushing touchdowns.\n\nSince Cowboys became a team in 1960, no RB had scored 4 TDs on them, per @Boys_Vox. Until today.\n\n\n\nAaron Jones: 155 total yards, 4 TDs \u2014 Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) October 6, 2019\n\nBy the time the defense regrouped to allow just 14 yards of offense in the fourth quarter, it was too late.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wait for a couple of explosive runs to decide that, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to buckle up and trust each other and play more disciplined,\u2019\u201d linebackers coach Ben Bloom told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cWe need to do that from the start of the game.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019ll look to execute that plan Sunday afternoon against the 0-4 New York Jets.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 66 rushing yards per game ranks third worst in the league, ahead only of the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins. The Cowboys have allowed at least 117 rushing yards in three of their five contests so far, including both losses. Players and coaches said they will hammer further this week on basic fundamentals, setting the edge, gap fits, assignments and aggressive tackling. But players from the largely intact fifth-best run D in 2018 left this Packers loss baffled by a Green Bay team they had felt prepared to take on. The Cowboys insisted they weren\u2019t surprised by scheme as much as they failed to execute.\n\n\u201cA poor performance by me,\u201d second-year linebacker Leighton Vander Esch lamented, adding to his list of issues \u201cbad footwork\u201d and \u201cbad tackling.\u201d Defensive lineman Tyrone Crawford said simply: \u201cWe messed up and we have to fix that.\u201d\n\n'WORST THREE WORDS IN FOOTBALL': Cowboys unpack loss to Packers\n\nOPINION: Sky is suddenly the limit for Packers offense\n\nNFL NEWSLETTER: Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\nAaron Jones left the Cowboys defense looking for answers. (Photo: Tim Heitman, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nWith Cowboys nose tackle Antwaun Woods (knee) expected to work more into practice this week, one key cog in clogging the lane should soon return. But the front seven will need to improve its communication to reduce the rampant missed tackles they fell victim to against Green Bay. They can\u2019t let the threat of a mobile quarterback derail their gap coverage inside.\n\n\u201cWe know firsthand that when you've got to defense a quarterback like Rodgers, you got to contain him,\u201d owner Jerry Jones said. \u201cYou also got to defend him. We let him out of containment quite a bit and you saw what he did to us. When you're doing all that, that opens those lanes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe story of the game were the turnovers and our inability to stop the run. \u2026 That was a little surprising to not be able to stop their run better than we did tonight.\n\nWhen the Cowboys host the Eagles in two weeks, they\u2019ll face a similarly mobile quarterback in Carson Wentz. The Eagles rank just 18th in rushing with 111.8 yards per game, but that\u2019s 25.5 more than the Packers came to AT&T Stadium averaging. It didn\u2019t matter. The stakes will only heighten in the NFC East matchup as an Eagles team currently riding a two-game win streak has caught the Cowboys at 3-2. Dallas now holds a lead only on account of the division-play tiebreaker. Without improved run defense, their lead will continue to fade into a remnant of a 3-0 past.\n\nPlayers assured they have the tools to make those changes.\n\n\u201cIt was all on us,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do our job and we didn\u2019t stay in our gaps.\n\n\u201cWe do our jobs and a lot of those things are stopped.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports\u2019 Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
