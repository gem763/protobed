We'll make it work. I've kissed Matty a couple of times already, so how hard can it be to take that next step? It won't be too much of an issue.'\n\nEoghan said he and Matt were both instantly attracted to Jordan, 28, and Isabelle, 27, following their arrival, but there was never any competition.\n\nAccepting: Despite finding himself in a 'love square' with Matthew, Jordan Cayless (left) and Isabelle Green, Eoghan said he'd also be open to his best friend dating his ex, Jordan\n\n'I'm 100 percent okay with Matty going after Jordan!' he confessed, before joking he'd even happily get in on the action\n\n'My initial physical attraction was more for Isabelle, and Matty's was for Jordan. So, we agreed that I would go after Isabelle for the time being, and Matty would go after Jordan,' he explained.\n\nBut the spark just wasn't there for the newly formed couples, and shortly afterwards, Eoghan ended up with Jordan, and Matt ended up with Isabelle.\n\n'Me and Matty were on the same page. Everyone was saying I stole his girl. That's not what happened at all! We knew what was going on,' he added.\n\n'I'm thinking maybe all three of us all go for it... We'll make it work.
