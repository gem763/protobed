A single place where information from all other platforms are gathered and sorted through.\n\nOutdated train platforms need to be upgraded, migrated and then commissioned or integrated into the new nerve centre in Thembisa. So far, 48 of the 98 platforms in Gauteng have been migrated.\n\nBy June next year, Prasa plans to have 80% of all Gauteng platforms connected to the nerve centre.\n\nWhile both Prasa and the Department of Transport have been in the process of modernisation for three years now, the 100-day commitment is an incentive to pick up the speed.\n\n'A game changer'\n\nThe War Room, housed in Prasa's offices, will be the \"game changer\", Mbalula said.\n\n\"The War Room is a physical space that will enable those deployed to the War Room to make rapid decisions based on the information they gather from the operations on the ground, on an hour by hour basis.\"\n\nThe War Room will track service recovery, safety management, the modernisation programme as well as organisational and operation progress within the 100 days.\n\n\"On a daily basis, the team will start the day with an assessment of the previous day's performance and identify issues that hamper performance and make decisions on how to resolve these,\" Mbalula said.\n\nHe continued, \"The relevant officials with delegated authority will action these discussions and report to the War Room through the daily status meetings.\n\n\"Performance will be managed and monitored daily to ensure sustained improvement.\"\n\nMbalula has until December 31, 2019, to show an improvement and added that there is an urgency to address the crisis of South Africa's railways.\n\n\"The urgency of addressing Prasa's turnaround cannot be overemphasised and tangible results that people can see must be realised in the shortest possible time.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
