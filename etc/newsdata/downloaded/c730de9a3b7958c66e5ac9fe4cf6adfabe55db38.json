I don\u2019t need to be listening to all of that crap, because so much of it is negative.\u201d\n\nLike his friend and one-time mentor Dave Chappelle, who launched a thousand think pieces when his most recent special dropped on Netflix a couple of weeks earlier, Burr has become known for pushing buttons with deliberately controversial jokes.\n\n\u201cDave Chappelle said something nice to me in the early 2000s and I held onto that for like five years,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNo matter how bleak it got, it\u2019s like, \u2018Dave Chappelle said I\u2019m funny!\u2019\u201d\n\nPaper Tiger, which he shot earlier this year at the Royal Albert Hall in London, includes rants against the #MeToo movement, \u201cmale feminists\u201d and a handful of Michelle Obama jokes that are guaranteed to horrify the kind of \u201cwoke\u201d liberal viewers he can\u2019t stand. Mocking the former first lady\u2019s best-selling book Becoming, Burr jokes, \u201cChapter One: How to tell if a dick tastes presidential.\u201d\n\nBut Burr insists he genuinely doesn\u2019t care about the \u201coutrage culture\u201d that dominates so much of the media coverage around comedy these days. \u201cIt feels like Chicken Little,\u201d he says, explaining that while it can seem like the sky is falling down on his head when he, for instance, makes a Caitlyn Jenner joke, the vast majority of viewers understand that he\u2019s just \u201cscrewing around\u201d and give him a pass.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhy he can\u2019t stand \u2018outrage culture\u2019\n\n\u201cOutrage culture is one of the most misrepresented things out there, how they will make such a small percentage of people seem like they\u2019re three million people. And it\u2019s not even necessarily because they believe in their cause, it\u2019s just that where the money\u2019s at is eyeballs and controversy and people arguing and being offended and watching somebody get in trouble makes people stop on your website or your TV channel and watch. But it\u2019s just not an accurate portrayal of where people\u2019s heads are at. It just isn\u2019t. It feels like Chicken Little. You go on stage and some nights you\u2019re going to do a bit and you go, should I say this? And it\u2019s like, what is going to happen? It\u2019s just a joke. And 99 percent of the people there\u2014100 percent most nights\u2014realize they went to a comedy club and everything you\u2019re saying [is a joke]. You\u2019re not watching legislation being written, it\u2019s not going to change anything, it\u2019s just somebody screwing around.\u201d\n\nWhy he thinks Trump will be re-elected in 2020\n\n\u201cOnce you perform long enough, everything just becomes a version of stand-up in your head. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t watch those presidential debates, because a lot of them are so astoundingly bad at public speaking. If someone gives a comedian crap, you can go, \u2018Ehh, go fuck yourself!\u2019 But as a politician you can\u2019t. But I think now, maybe you could. What blew me away watching Trump do what he did, the things that he said in the past would take down somebody\u2019s campaign. Or you thought it would if you said those things and the media would be all over him and that would be it. It\u2019s kind of blown me away that in four years, it doesn\u2019t look like anybody is going to [be able to beat Trump]. It\u2019s like a pay-per-view fight, I want to see a good fight here. I don\u2019t want to see Tyson-McNeeley.\u201d\n\nOn his controversial Michelle Obama jokes\n\n\u201cIt struck me as funny that she was considered this feminist icon. And I was like, what is feminist about her life? She went to an Ivy League school and she got a law degree. Yeah, and then she abandoned her career to stand behind her husband and clap and smile at everything that he said. And just the attention that that gets, how inspirational she is. And look, I\u2019m not totally shitting on her, but it\u2019s just a funny thing to do as a comedian. And if people take it seriously it makes it even funnier. It\u2019s a joke. The same way I\u2019m not above being heckled, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s above being made fun of.\u201d\n\nOn being labeled an \u2018angry\u2019 comic\n\n\u201cOne of the misunderstandings of me is that if I\u2019m on stage doing a character or yelling about something that I\u2019m actually angry. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m having fun. I\u2019m having the time of my life. I\u2019ve gone on stage angry. My act does not work. I get off stage and I have a headache. I feel bad and I feel bad for the crowd. I feel like I let them down and that I selfishly\u2014whatever happened in my day, it wasn\u2019t their fault. And they paid for a sitter and they paid to have a show, not to have me go up there and act like a fuckin\u2019 baby. So there\u2019s a difference between that and having something that drives you nuts and sharing with people and they can share in their frustration. That\u2019s the difference. When people say \u2018you\u2019re an angry comic,\u2019 it always makes me laugh, because they don\u2019t know I\u2019m having the time of my life.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Comedy Bang!
