Microsoft and PayPal were the top boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.\n\nShares of 3M dropped after the industrial conglomerate missed third-quarter sales estimates and lowered its full-year profit forecast. The company\u2019s U.S. sales dropped 1.1% and its Asia-Pacific sales fell 5% as industrial production slowed.\n\nIndividual company results have greatly swayed the direction of Wall Street\u2019s major indexes this week in the midst of earnings season. More than 80% of the 168 S&P 500 companies that have reported results have beaten profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nYet the earnings season has also reflected signs of economic vulnerability, said John Carey, managing director at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, the earnings reports have supported a view of the economy as slowing,\u201d he said.\n\nIn particular, 3M\u2019s results pointed to continued fallout from the U.S.-China trade dispute, said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s showing us that the tariff situation continues to be a major concern for companies in how to spend their money,\u201d Kinahan said.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 28.42 points, or 0.11%, to 26,805.53, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 5.77 points, or 0.19%, to 3,010.29 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 66.00 points, or 0.81%, to 8,185.80.\n\nAfter the bell, shares of Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) moved sharply following the companies\u2019 results. Intel shares were last up about 8% while Amazon shares were last down around 9%.\n\nLam Research Corp (LRCX.O) shares jumped 13.9%, hitting a record high, after the chip equipment maker forecast strong results for the December quarter. Lam Research was the top boost to the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX, which rose 2.5% a day after being pressured by losses in shares of Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O).\n\nTwitter shares plummeted 20.8% after the social networking company\u2019s revenue and profit missed estimates, in part due to technical issues with its ad platform.\n\nFord Motor Co (F.N) shares tumbled 6.6% after the automaker cut its profit outlook for the year. By contrast, Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) shares surged 17.7% after the electric car maker reported a surprise quarterly profit.\n\nDow Inc (DOW.N) shares advanced 4.7% after the chemicals company beat profit estimates, having cut costs to offset a sharp drop in global demand.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares fell 1.8% after CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) said it was pulling 22-ounce bottles of J&J baby powder from its stores.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 24, 2019.
