She added that the country had not undertaken any study to ascertain the impact of demonetisation on different sectors. \u201cThe government has not undertaken any specific study to find out the impact of demonetisation on Indian economy, particularly MSME industries and on employment,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said while the manufacturing sector has witnessed a certain fall but it cannot be attributed to demonetisation.\n\nHowever, there are numerous conflicting reports that point at demonetisation for slow economic growth since November 2016. A paper by US-based National Bureau of Economic Research reveal demonetisation lowered the growth rate of economic activity by at least two percentage points.\n\nIn March, the Reserve Bank of India, in a reply to RTI query revealed that they had warned of impact of demonetisation on Indian economy and no effect on black money.\n\nBCCL\n\nThe board, according to minutes of a meeting disclosed by RBI in an RTI reply, had met just two-and-a-half hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the demonetisation decision on 8 November 2016.\n\nDon't Miss 6.8 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 946 SHARES 351 SHARES 403 SHARES\n\nCurbing black money was one of the prime objectives of the shock move to junk old \u20b9500 and 1,000 currency notes, which saw 86 per cent of cash by value going out of circulation.\n\n\"Most of the black money is held not in the form of cash but in the form of real sector assets such as gold or real estate and that this move would not have a material impact on those assets,\" the board observed in its 561st meeting held in Delhi.\n\nThe RBI also confirmed that most demonetised notes were returned to the central bank. The RBI annual report for 2017-18 released in August 2018 shows that almost all the banned banknotes, or 99.3 per cent of the notes withdrawn, were returned to the central bank.\n\nImmediately after demonetisation (November-December 2016), sales of consumer durables and appliances slipped by 40 per cent. Tier II towns and beyond bore the greatest brunt of demonetisation. Schemes encouraging digital payments, promos and discounts had little effect on consumer durables market.\n\nAccording to a report by Business Standard, The National Sample Survey Office\u2019s Periodic Labour Force Survey recorded the unemployment rate in India at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-\u201918.\n\nThis was the first full financial year after the government demonetised high-value currency notes in November 2016 and the citizens were thrown unexpectedly into a pit.", "description": "Replying to questions in the Rajya Sabha, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the ban on high-value currency notes has had no effect on the country's economy.
