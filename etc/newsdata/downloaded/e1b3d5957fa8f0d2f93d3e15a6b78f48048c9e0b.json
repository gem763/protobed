One feels for Alison Rose, the new boss of RBS, that the Q3 numbers from the bank and erstwhile global financial institution fall into the latter category.'\n\nRBS's additional PPI charge is the last, as the deadline for claims was on 29 August.\n\nThe bank has put aside \u00a36.2billion for PPI claims in total, of which \u00a35billion has actually been used up.\n\nIts third quarter results also show that the bank's net interest margin fell by 5 basis points to 1.97 per cent, partly due to strong competition in the mortgages market.\n\nHowever, the bank said income across the retail and commercial banking arms was 'broadly stable' compared with the previous quarter.\n\nThe figures mark the last for boss Ross McEwan before he hands over to Alison Rose, the lending giant's first female chief executive, on 31 October.\n\nDespite the third-quarter losses, RBS reiterated its full-year guidance and said operating profits stood at \u00a32.7billion for the nine months of the year so far, down slightly on the \u00a32.8billion reported a year ago.\n\nChief financial officer Katie Murray said: 'These results demonstrate our solid underlying performance in a tough operating environment.\n\n'We have seen strong growth across the business and our sustained high levels of capital and liquidity mean we are well positioned to support our customers in these uncertain times.'\n\nRichard Hunter at interactive investor said not all the positive momentum from the half-year numbers had evaporated.\n\n'The full year target of \u00a3300million cost savings remains on track, the bank has experienced net lending growth and, despite the third quarter loss, in the nine months of the year so far RBS is comfortably ahead in terms of pre-tax profit at \u00a32.7billion, albeit slightly shy of the previous year.'\n\n'It remains to be seen whether this quarter is more of an anomaly than a trend,' he added.\n\nThe figures mark the last for boss Ross McEwan before he hands over to Alison Rose, the lending giant's first female chief executive, on 31 October\n\nNicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, also pointed to some positive signs, including low bad loans and continued lending growth at RBS' retail and commercial banks.\n\n'While the difference between what the bank can earn on loans and has to pay on deposits remains under pressure, the interest margin is holding up reasonably well in our view,' he said.\n\n'It's important not to lose sight of what RBS is though,' he added.\n\n'Banks are bellwethers for the economies they operate in and the outlook for the UK remains uncertain. If things take a turn for the worst demand for new loans will likely dry up and bad loans spike \u2013 leaving RBS in a very uncomfortable position.'", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland has revealed a loss of \u00a38million after PPI claims surged ahead of the final deadline in August and its investment banking arm had a 'particularly challenging quarter'.", "authors": ["Camilla Canocchi For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
