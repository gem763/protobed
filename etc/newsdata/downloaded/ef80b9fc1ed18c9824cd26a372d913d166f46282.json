APD and ERO Houston further investigated, which led to ICE locating and arresting Serrano Vargas. Following this arrest, OCDA\u2019s Science and Technology Unit assisted in confirming Serrano Vargas\u2019 identity through the use of Rapid DNA technology.\"\n\nApparently, Serrano Vargas was removed from the U.S. three times in less than a week in 2006. \"In December 2006, Serrano Vargas illegally entered the U.S. three times in a span of eight days; he was removed to Mexico on Dec. 12, Dec. 14 and Dec. 18,\" ICE said. He then returned again and had been hiding in the U.S. for 13 years.\n\n\"For almost two decades this criminal alien fugitive has gone to tremendous lengths to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities for his alleged crimes in California,\" Patrick Contreras, field office director for ICE Houston, told the media.\n\n\"Our ICE Fugitive Operations team tracked down and arrested Serrano Vargas, removing a potentially dangerous criminal alien from our community and ensuring that he will face prosecution for his alleged crimes,\" Contreras added.\n\nVargas was arrested on September 11, and faces extradition back to California to face trial for the alleged 2000 murder.\n\nThis report comes as Democratic candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders have called for a ban on all deportations of illegal immigrants residing in the country. In the fiscal year 2018, ICE arrested 1,641 illegal immigrants with homicide convictions.", "description": ".09/18/2019 19:22:55PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/207/beb31c5f-c485-459e-a8d4-58683317d091.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
