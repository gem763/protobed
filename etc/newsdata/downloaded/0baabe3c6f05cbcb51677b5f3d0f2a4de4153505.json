From ruling France to shooting alligators to tap dancing her way to Minnesota American Teen Princess, she\u2019s built a career by playing vibrant, unapologetic women with very specific interests. But in Showtime\u2019s On Becoming a God in Central Florida, her character Krystal Stubbs shows off a truly out-of-left-field talent: synchronized puppet dancing.\n\nIn the show\u2019s second episode, sinking under debt and suddenly forced to deal with her dead husband\u2019s stake in a pyramid scheme, Krystal proudly dons a puppet \u201crig\u201d and performs her pageant-winning dance for a prospective client, Buzz (P.J. Marshall), and his daughter Becca (Ava Esquivel), a hesitant pageant contestant. The dance is funny at first, begging you to feel embarrassed for Krystal. Then it melts into a deeply lonely, desperate display of a woman willing to do anything to survive. It sums up both the heart of the show and Kirsten Dunst\u2019s immense talent in a brief, ridiculous dance routine. But it wasn\u2019t always supposed to feature puppets.\n\n\u201cWe wrote it as a snake dance,\u201d co-creator Robert Funke said. \u201cShe pulls the snake out of her cooler and does a whole dance with it.\u201d That initial idea fit with the character, Funke said, because the audience has already seen that Krystal doesn\u2019t shy away from reptiles: Earlier in the episode, she skinned and gutted two alligators \u2014 the gators that may or may not have killed her husband \u2014 in the very same garage where she winds up doing the dance.\n\nBut while Krystal Stubbs isn\u2019t afraid of snakes, Kirsten Dunst is.\n\n\u201cWhen we first pitched that to Kirsten, she was like, \u2018I\u2019m not touching snakes. I do not like snakes, so I\u2019m not doing that\u2019,\u201d Funke said. \u201cMatt [Lutsky, co-creator] and I, not having ever done a TV show before, were like, Well, I guess they use body doubles and stuff. We\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\n\nWith just a few days before they had to shoot the scene, after talking to episode director Jeremy Podeswa, a few snake wranglers, and texting Dunst one more time to see if she would change her mind \u2014 \u201cShe was like, \u2018Are you fucking telling me that you\u2019re about to ask me to do this snake dance after I told you very clearly that I do not like snakes?\u2019\u201d \u2014 Funke took the problem back to the writers\u2019 room. What sort of shocking talent could Krystal reveal in the scene?\n\n\u201cIt was all looking pretty grim until I started looking around at street performers online and remembered that I had seen a guy in L.A. dancing with one of these [puppet] rigs,\u201d Funke said. \u201cThere was a guy on America\u2019s Got Talent who did it with one, and then there\u2019s a few other videos of street performers. I was like, Maybe that could be it?\u201d\n\nAfter sending another text to Dunst (just the words \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d and a link to a street dancer), Funke got started on his own rig, made with nine four-foot dowels, electrical tape, a neon-green safety vest, and hazmat suits. That night, just days before they were scheduled to shoot, he showed off his rig on Kirsten Dunst\u2019s back patio, surrounded by her husband Jesse Plemons, Plemons\u2019s family, their baby, and a freshly spray-tanned Dunst. Instead of puppets, the test rig only had flaps of cloth hanging off of it.\n\n\u201cAfter we demonstrated with the rig, I was waiting for Kirsten to drop off the show and ruin everything and be mad at me forever. I looked over and she was crying. I was like, Why are you crying? And she goes, She just tries so hard, talking about Krystal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was this moment for both of us to recognize what this show is about. That we could go just about anywhere, as long as we kept it all within the bounds of what Krystal is trying to do for herself and for her daughter.\u201d\n\nWith Dunst\u2019s approval, Funke then took the rig to props master Michael Martin and costume designer Stacey Battat, who made the actual puppets and their glam outfits. The final product was shot on the very last day of filming for the episode, with a much better rig and the same song they had always intended to use, \u201cStraight On\u201d by Heart. There was a moment where they almost went with \u201cPotential New Boyfriend\u201d by Dolly Parton, Funke said, but \u201cStraight On\u201d won out based on comedy: \u201cIt\u2019s got that great corny choreography line, where when she says, \u2018Straight on,\u2019 [Krystal] points at the camera.\u201d\n\nEven as she\u2019s swinging puppets with painted-on lipstick around a makeshift stage in her garage, you never stop believing in Krystal Stubbs. \u201cShe has this ability to connect with and empathize with people, whether that\u2019s a person in a garage or a big crowd at a rally,\u201d Funke said. Still, the scene ends with a reminder of Krystal\u2019s precarious footing: When she turns off the stereo and switches to business mode, Buzz refuses to meet her price for pageant training and she walks away with nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s no snake dance, but Funke believes that puppet dance accomplishes way more than a Britney Spears \u201cI\u2019m a Slave 4 U\u201d\u2013style performance might have. \u201cIt was a moment where we all appreciated what the show could be. That it could be as crazy and funny as we wanted, while also meaning everything that we want it to mean.\u201d Funke said. \u201cWe can crank both up to 100 at the same time.\u201d", "description": "Why does Krystal Stubbs (Kirsten Dunst) dance with two puppets in the second episode of Showtime\u2019s \u2018On Becoming a God in Central Florida?\u2019 We had the same question, so we asked the show\u2019s co-creator.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/03/03-on-becoming-a-god.w1200.h630.jpg"}
