In recent weeks he\u2019s ordered a bipartisan Senate intelligence investigation, backed a resolution written by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer demanding that the administration turn over the then-secret whistleblower report, and announced he\u2019d been privately pushing the administration to release aid to Ukraine that had been held up before Trump\u2019s phone call with that country\u2019s president.\n\nWhile no Senate Republican has yet said Trump should be impeached over Ukraine, what they have said suggests he might not have a solid wall behind him if damaging information continues to come out. Trump\u2019s sometime rival Mitt Romney of Utah has called the president\u2019s actions \u201ctroubling in the extreme.\u201d Nebraska\u2019s Ben Sasse, who criticized Trump as a candidate but has fallen in line since, said his colleagues shouldn\u2019t rush to \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d around the president. And Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina has vowed to \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of what happened.\n\nIt would likely take a collapse in support for Trump among Republican voters to change GOP senators\u2019 calculus. While polls show increasing approval among the public for impeachment, it\u2019s come mostly from Democrats. The president\u2019s approval rating among GOP voters remains above 80% in public polls, making any Republican senator\u2019s defection a potentially career-ending decision.", "description": "", "authors": ["Bloomberg.Com News Articles What-Will-Mcconnell-S-Senate-Do-In-Trump-Impeachment-Fight"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
