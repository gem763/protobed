The fashion house Fendi is funding the \u20ac2.5m restoration of the Temple of Venus, which was inaugurated by the emperor Hadrian in AD135, and Gucci is paying \u20ac1.6m to restore the Tarpeian Rock, a cliff on the Capitoline Hill from where ancient Romans threw traitors to their death.\n\nFendi also paid to clean and restore the Trevi fountain in 2015, while the shoe company Tod\u2019s provided the money to restore the Colosseum. Bulgari, the jewellery company, donated \u20ac1.5m to spruce up the Spanish Steps.\n\nThis year, inmates from Rome\u2019s Rebibbia prison were drafted in to help fix Rome\u2019s streets as part of an initiative that authorities labelled \u201cI redeem myself for Rome\u201d.\n\nThe mayor, Virginia Raggi, is regularly criticised for the state of the city, including its poor transport system and scrappy parks. The rubbish crisis recently led to a boom in demand for pest control services in apartment buildings.", "description": "Rinascente will pay for improvements to walkways outside its flagship store", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bfcdd556c1b537ced5e11fefd08e32740d494cc/0_248_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5779e1d13f80b8e85d43b8cbeb5bc8ac", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
