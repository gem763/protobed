He was a big f\u2014ing person, especially then, he was getting ready for Bane [in 2012\u2019s The Dark Knight Rises].\u201d\n\nThe actor continued, \u201cMy girlfriend at the time was over at my house, we were on the balcony and we saw him and his trainer come back from the gym. We used to f\u2014 with each other all the time. It just so happened one week my girlfriend is in town and he runs into the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe picked me up and I didn\u2019t have nothing on so now I\u2019m naked, on his shoulder, we\u2019re in the hallway, we\u2019re wrestling around,\u201d LaBeouf said. \u201cAnd then I got upset about it because he got the better of me but I\u2019m in some weird, twisty naked position. My s\u2014\u2019s over here and his s\u2014\u2019s over here and I\u2019m like, \u2018Uh, don\u2019t.'\u201d\n\nTom Hardy & Shia LaBeouf in Lawless | Weinstein Company/ Everett More\n\nThe wrestling match proved to be too much for either to handle.\n\n\u201cWe wound up inching over to the stairs and he fell down the stairs,\u201d LaBeouf explained. \u201cHe wound up hurting his back so for the rest of the shoot, he told everybody I knocked him out but that wasn\u2019t the case. We were having some weird cutey wrestling match.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Shia LaBeouf Says He\u2019s on His \u2018Ninth Life\u2019 After \u2018F\u2014 Ups\u2019: \u2018I\u2019ve Never Felt More Human\u2019\n\nHardy holds no hard feelings, either. The Mad Max: Fury Road actor spoke to Esquire about LaBeouf\u2019s talent in 2018.\n\n\u201cShia has the ability to land scene after scene that builds a reality from utter fantasy,\u201d Hardy said of LaBeouf\u2019s acting in Transformers. \u201cWe know the robots aren\u2019t really there. They just aren\u2019t. When I watch Shia, they are.\u201d\n\nLaBeouf can next be seen in The Peanut Butter Falcon which is now in theaters and his semi-autobiographical Honey Boy, which is scheduled to be released on Nov. 8 by Amazon Studios.", "description": "Shia LaBeouf Says He Wrestled with Tom Hardy While Naked", "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/L.Fu0r7A10Wyv3KCZUNavg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/da10d263dd5f2174717fddcd0bf7c620", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
