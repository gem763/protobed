Patriots' Michael Bennett gives apt description", "language": "en", "text": "Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is one of the strongest players in the NFL at his position.\n\nThe 37-year-old stands at 6-foot-5 and 240 pounds, making him one of the most difficult quarterbacks to bring down.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nPatriots defensive lineman Michael Bennett was posed a simple question after Wednesday's practice about what it's like to tackle Roethlisberger, and he gave a fantastic response.\n\n\"Kinda like tackling a truck,\" Bennett told reporters. \"He's kinda hard to tackle. Strong guy, able to stay in the pocket and being able to still throw the ball with guys hanging off of him. Him and Cam Newton are two of the hardest quarterbacks to tackle. I think quarterbacks are always hard to tackle because they have so much heart -- they have the will of the team on their back. When you look at guys who have that, plus size, it's just hard to tackle them.\"\n\nBennett and the rest of the Patriots front seven have their work cut out for them Sunday when they host the Steelers at Gillette Stadium for the season opener. The Steelers have a very good offensive line and allowed just 24 sacks last season, the fourth-fewest in the league.\n\n\"I think it's always a challenge playing the Steelers because they have such a great camaraderie with their offensive line being together for so long -- eight years,\" Bennett said. \"These guys have played a lot of games together. Big Ben is such a great quarterback. It's always hard to play against offensive lines that know each other very well.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Patriots' pass rush struggled last season, tallying the second-fewest sacks in the league. New England should be able to put more pressure on opposing quarterbacks in 2019 with the additions of Bennett and rookie edge rusher Chase Winovich, and the results from both players during the preseason certainly were encouraging. The Patriots did put a good amount of pressure on Roethlisberger in their loss to the Steelers last season, forcing two interceptions and sacking him twice. They need to give a similar defensive effort to start the new season with a win.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
