(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nBuried in the controversy over President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was an effort by the Ukrainian leader at currying favor with Trump through his business.\n\n\u201cActually, last time I traveled to the United States, I stayed in New York near Central Park, and I stayed at the Trump Tower,\u201d Zelensky told Trump, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 call released Wednesday.\n\nZelensky\u2019s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.\n\nOther Ukrainian officials have also patronized Trump properties. A top Zelensky aide met at Trump\u2019s D.C. hotel in July with Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, a frequent patron of the hotel himself, according to the New York Times. A lobbyist who registered as an agent of Zelensky\u2019s with the U.S. government hosted a $1,900 event at the D.C. hotel in April, according to a federal filing.\n\n[House intelligence committee releases whistleblower's complaint citing Trump's call with Ukraine's president]\n\nInternal hotel listings of \u201cVIP\u201d guests at the hotel, obtained by The Washington Post, show that Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Guiliani\u2019s in his efforts to build connections with Ukraine, stayed at the hotel in April 2018 and were listed as Trump loyalty-card members and repeat customers.\n\n\u201cThis is what we\u2019ve been warning about for years: proof directly from the White House that a foreign leader is trying to get in Trump\u2019s good graces by telling him he stayed at his hotel,\u201d said the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, in a statement.\n\nAnother advocacy group, Public Citizen, tweeted: \u201cThe Ukrainian president telling Trump that he spent money at his New York hotel is an important reminder that our president violates the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause every. single. day.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear whether the stays were illegal, however. Zelensky may not have entered office at the time of his stay at Trump International Tower, overlooking Central Park in New York.\n\nA spokeswoman for Zelensky declined to say when the president\u2019s New York stay took place, but Zelensky posted several images from New York City \u2014 including a video jogging in Central Park \u2014 on social media in March 2018. That was 14 months before Zelensky entered office and more than six months before he entered the race for president in Ukraine.\n\n[Who is Ukranian president Volodymyr Zelensky?]\n\nLegal experts said the timing made that visit unlikely to violate the foreign emoluments clause, which bars the acceptance of gifts \u201cfrom any King, Prince, or foreign State.\u201d In three lawsuits winding their way through the court systems, Democrats and business competitors of Trump allege that Trump violates the emoluments ban by accepting payments from foreign leaders.\n\n\u201cThe attempt here is to find a quid pro quo and the argument could be that Trump gave [Zelensky] something to reward him for staying at the hotel a year or so earlier,\u201d said Boston College law professor George Brown. Based on the available information about Zelensky\u2019s stay, he said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a weak argument.\u201d\n\nOther foreign leaders \u2014 including from Kuwait, Bahrain and Malaysia \u2014 haven\u2019t been bashful about holding events at the Trump hotel in D.C., and when the crown prince of Saudi Arabia made his visit to New York last year, members of his entourage also stayed at Trump\u2019s New York hotel.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr plans to hold a holiday bash at the D.C. hotel in December that will cost a minimum of $30,000, according to documents obtained by The Post. In court, Justice Department attorneys have argued Trump has done nothing wrong. Trump\u2019s company, which did not return a request for comment, donates what it calculates to be profits from foreign business to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nStill, the idea behind the foreign emoluments clause, said University of Iowa law professor Andy Grewal, is that \u201cif a foreign leader is paying you, then that\u2019s a violation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he is just going on a summer vacation as a private citizen with his wife, that\u2019s a different story,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched an impeachment inquiry over Trump\u2019s attempts to convince Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, other House Democrats pushed for more information about Trump\u2019s hotel business.\n\n[Seven days: Inside Trump's frenetic response to the whistleblower complaint and the battle over impeachment]\n\nIn a morning subcommittee hearing, Democrats on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee asked why officials from the General Services Administration \u2014 the agency that leases the Old Post Office to Trump for his D.C. hotel \u2014 have repeatedly refused to hand over financial records and legal memos related to the project.\n\nAccording to the lease agreement between the Trump Organization and the GSA, the government should receive a cut of earnings after the hotel hits certain financial benchmarks. But the agency has not disclosed information about the hotel\u2019s performance, following a request from Trump\u2019s private lawyers that it be withheld.\n\n\u201cHow do we know what the income is? How do we know how GSA is calculating the profits?\u201d said Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.), Transportation Committee chairman. \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we are getting a damn penny out of this thing or not.\u201d\n\nDan Mathews, head of the GSA\u2019s Public Building Service, said that last year the agency received just the base annual rent from the Trump Organization of $3 million. He said the agency was reviewing how much more information to release.\n\nRepublicans on the committee called the hearing politically motivated. Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, said the panel should be focusing on infrastructure improvements or disaster relief rather than investigating the hotel project \u201cbecause of the perception of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the property was losing money for the government before Trump turned it into a luxury hotel that is now producing government revenue.\n\n\u201cThis is a good deal for the American taxpayer,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWe can deal with the emoluments issue separately.\u201d\n\nMeadows knows the hotel well, as his campaign has spent $11,435 there, according to campaign finance filings.", "description": "Zelensky\u2019s comments mark the first known example of an interaction Democrats and government ethics experts warned about when Trump took office: that foreign leaders would try to influence Trump by spending money at his properties and telling him about it.", "authors": ["Jonathan O'Connell", "Reporter Covering Economic Development With A Focus On Commercial Real Estate", "The Trump Organization", "David A.
