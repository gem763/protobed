REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nThe case is one of a series across the United Kingdom challenging Prime Minister\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy. Johnson has said Britain must leave the EU on Oct. 31, whether or not it secures a deal on an orderly exit.\n\nScotland\u2019s highest court of appeal ruled on Wednesday that Johnson\u2019s decision to suspend parliament for five weeks was unlawful and should be annulled, a verdict that will be appealed at the United Kingdom Supreme Court next week.\n\nRights campaigner Raymond McCord, one of three people backing the case, said he would fight the decision in an appeal that could be heard in Belfast as early as Friday and hoped to join the other challenges in the UK\u2019s highest court next week.\n\nLawyers for McCord had argued that a no-deal Brexit would breach the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to the British-run province, but Judge Bernard McCloskey said the case \u201ctrespassed upon the prohibited domain of the non-justiciable\u201d.\n\n\u201cI consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute,\u201d McCloskey said in a 68-page written judgement.\n\n\u201cVirtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national.\u201d\n\nA lawyer representing Johnson\u2019s government said on Monday that under Article 50 of the EU Treaty, the obligation to negotiate was on Brussels rather than on the member state.\n\nUK legislation in 2017 and 2018 \u201cassumes but does not require a Withdrawal Agreement,\u201d said the lawyer, Tony McGleenan.\n\nThe Northern Ireland case had also sought a legal challenge to the suspension of parliament but the court decided to hear the wider case against \u201cno deal\u201d.\n\n\u201cGROUNDBREAKING LEGAL CASES\u201d\n\nParliament was prorogued, or suspended, on Monday until Oct. 14, a move opponents argued was designed to allow the prime minister to push through a no-deal exit from the European Union on Oct. 31 with little scrutiny.\n\nA separate legal challenge to the suspension, brought by British campaigner Gina Miller, will also be heard by the Supreme Court on Tuesday.\n\nMcCord said Northern Ireland should also be present at the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThese are groundbreaking legal cases and the plan is for all of these cases to meet in the Supreme Court,\u201d Ciaran O\u2019Hare, lawyer for Raymond McCord, told reporters.\n\nMcCord\u2019s son was murdered by pro-British militants in 1997, just before the peace deal, which largely ended three decades of violence between Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and pro-British unionists. Some 3,600 people died in the conflict.", "description": "Belfast's High Court dismissed on Thursday a case arguing that a British exit from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement would contravene Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.", "authors": ["Amanda Ferguson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429028634&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0QH", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
