Ramos Miranda\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Students and trade unionists led marches through Santiago on Wednesday in the first formally organised demonstration against social inequality since Chilean President Sebastian Pinera pledged social reforms to try to quell days of rioting.\n\nThousands of striking workers, including healthcare workers and teachers, sang and carried banners in the capital and other cities. The largely peaceful marches were monitored by police and soldiers.\n\nThe gatherings dovetailed four days of protests, arson attacks and looting which has seen more than 6,000 people detained and at least 15 people killed. Thousands of Chileans defied a state of emergency and military curfews.\n\nTrade unions and social organisations wanted a voice in the rollout of a social reform plan announced by Pinera on Tuesday night, said Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Debelli, president of the National Grouping of Fiscal Employees (ANEF), one of the unions that called the strike.\n\n\u201cWe must carry the voice of those who are on the street, to channel anger and discontent over the inequality of our country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Copper Workers Federation (FTC), which includes unionized workers from each division of state miner Codelco, the world\u2019s top copper producer, agreed late on Tuesday to join the general, nationwide strike on Wednesday.\n\nCodelco said one of its mines was shut and operations at a smelter drastically reduced.\n\nSix of Codelco\u2019s eight divisions were carrying on with the \u201cmajority of their operations,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nCopper producer Antofagasta Plc (ANTO.L) said on Wednesday protests in Chile could cut its production by about 5,000 tonnes, equivalent to less than 3% of third quarter output, because of delays in supplies and travel disruptions for workers.\n\nJimena Blanco, Head of Latin America research at consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said it was \u201ca matter of time\u201d before the knock-on effects along the supply chain had a negative impact on the mining industry.\n\n\u201cFor example, yesterday\u2019s strike by the port workers\u2019 union affected 20 of the country\u2019s maritime facilities, including key mining export ones in Antofagasta and Iquique,\u201d she said.\n\nREFORM PACKAGE\n\nIn his announcement, Pinera said he hoped to turn the violent protests into an \u201copportunity\u201d for Chile..\n\nPinera\u2019s proposed reforms include a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in the state pension and the stabilization of electricity costs.\n\nThe president said the package represented \u201cconcrete and urgent steps\u201d to resolve inequality that has sent tens of thousands into the streets to demand an economic overhaul and, in some cases, his removal.\n\nDemonstrators run from a police water cannon during a protest against Chile's state economic model in Santiago, Chile October 23, 2019.

Reuters has been unable to confirm the authenticity of the images.\n\nChile\u2019s Human Rights Institute (INDH) said it received a complaint of torture in a central Santiago metro station and urged the authorities to investigate. The group said it had also registered 173 civilians injured by firearms since the weekend.\n\nProsecutors said on Wednesday afternoon that 6,493 people had been charged for involvement in protests and rioting since Saturday.\n\nJoaquin Lavin, the mayor of the upmarket suburb Las Condes east of Santiago, raised concerns about the shooting of three people outside a condominium in the early hours of Tuesday morning when a military curfew was in place. One person remains in serious condition in hospital, Lavin said.\n\nThe mayor said parents who lived during Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990 understood military curfews better and should explain the concept to their children. Soldiers should also exercise caution using their weapons in a heavily-populated area, Lavin said. \u201cThose who use force must use it prudently,\u201d he said.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nJustice Minister Hernan Larrain said the deaths and injuries was a source of \u201cdeep pain\u201d for the government.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to democracy is inalienable and inseparable from the respect and protection of human rights and the operation of the Rule of Law,\u201d Chilean daily La Tercera quoted him as saying.", "description": "Students and trade unionists led marches through Santiago on Wednesday in the first formally organised demonstration against social inequality since Chilean President Sebastian Pinera pledged social reforms to try to quell days of rioting.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444267791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M23A", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
