But we really have now reached the reckoning point.\n\nStaring into a ditch: Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reached 'the reckoning point' in the Brexit process as this week is the final chance of clinching a vital deal, according to Mr Hodges\n\nTime is up. Either a deal is agreed this week, or the chances of securing one evaporate for good.\n\nThere can be no more open-ended extensions. No frantic letter-writing to the chairman of the 1922 Committee.\n\nThose who want Britain to leave the European Union are out of options. They back the Prime Minister and his Thornton House pact, or Brexit dies.\n\nFor the allies of Boris, there is no sugar-coating the nature of the choice they now have to make.\n\nThe full details of Thursday's agreement remain shrouded in mystery, but one thing is clear. It was Britain, not Ireland or the EU, that made the most significant concessions. Boris may not have blinked completely, but he was compelled to flutter his eyelashes at Leo Varadkar.\n\nBrexit talks: Mr Johnson held private talks with Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar over Brexit this week\n\nWhich leaves Arlene Foster and her DUP colleagues facing the toughest decision of all. They have already moved further than anyone thought possible by accepting the partition of Great Britain and Northern Ireland along the Irish Sea.\n\nBut now they will have to move again, and relinquish the veto that would have made that painful separation a temporary one.\n\nThe Spartans of the ERG will also have to swallow their pride, and sound the retreat. They will not have the No Deal Brexit they crave. Ugly, messy compromise, rather than a glorious charge, is now the only route out of the EU.\n\nIt's about to get ugly for Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit rebels as well. Last week 19 of them sent a letter to Jean-Claude Juncker urging him 'to work night and day, if required, to agree a deal so the UK Parliament can make a clear decision to close this chapter in the coming weeks'. He is complying with their request.\n\nSo a swarm of feral Corbynites and kamikaze Remainers is set to descend on these 'Red Tories' preparing to vote through a Conservative Brexit.\n\nThis also represents the final chance for the Conservative Party's own 21 prisoners of conscience. They have consistently said their goal is to stop a No Deal Brexit, not derail Brexit entirely. So they too face their moment of truth.\n\n'It seems this is quite a hard Brexit they're pushing,' one Tory rebel told me on Friday. Perhaps it is. But they either support Boris now, or turn their backs on their party for ever.\n\nFor all those MPs who genuinely seek to deliver on the instruction given them in the referendum by the British people \u2013 as opposed to those who cynically trot out the mantra 'I respect the result but\u2026' \u2013 there is no longer anywhere left to hide. The past week has seen to that. Downing Street has no 'secret plan' to be activated if the talks break down.\n\nThe moment a senior No 10 aide began briefing that Boris would defy the Queen and lecture her on how she was powerless to sack him in the event of a lost vote of no confidence, it became clear talk of legal challenges and multiple letter ruses to circumvent the Benn Act was simply braggadocio and bluster.\n\nThere are also signs the fall-back strategy of channelling anger at Parliament's intransigence into a bulldozing No Deal majority is failing to work.\n\nA ComRes poll published on Friday revealed if the Prime Minister doesn't deliver on his pledge to leave by the 31st it would result in a hung Parliament, regardless of who the public blames.\n\nThe Brexiteers have to realise it really is now or never. There are not going to be any second chances. There is no Better Brexit waiting just over the horizon.\n\nThey either seize the day, or night envelopes them. Yes, there is some muttering about being let down. That Boris's deal is merely a pig sporting Theresa May's lipstick.\n\nBut the Prime Minister deserves more credit than that. The accusation he was negotiating in bad faith has been disproved. Yes, he has given ground. But so have the Irish and the EU.\n\nLeo Varadkar vowed never to engage bilaterally with the UK. In the garden of Thornton House \u2013 much to the surprise of Mr Johnson's own team \u2013 he did. We were told repeatedly the Withdrawal Agreement would never be reopened. This weekend it has been.\n\nBut the opportunity this presents will not remain open for long. Brexit's opponents had the opportunity to sabotage the entire process, and blew it.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court vetoed the prorogation, and dragged Boris back to the Commons, the Remainers had him at their mercy.\n\nThey could have moved in for the kill with a no confidence motion. They could have accelerated the timetable for an extension.\n\nThey could even have started laying the groundwork for a second referendum. But they squandered their opportunity in a self-indulgent squabble over who would lead the nation when Boris and Brexit fell.\n\nThey will not squander it again. You can sense their fear. 'If Boris Johnson gets a deal, it won't have a mandate without a people's vote,' David Lammy tweeted, as he and his colleagues began a desperate reverse ferret on their mantra that Parliament holds primacy over any 'advisory' referenda.\n\nIf Boris's deal is passed this week \u2013 first by Brussels, then by MPs in their historic Saturday session \u2013 it is over. In that instant our Brexit purgatory ends. And any party that tries to fight the subsequent Election on a platform of reopening this hellish Pandora's Box, and returning us to the chaos and paralysis of the past three years, will find themselves run out of town and out of politics.\n\nTough decisions: DUP leader Arlene Foster had to back accept the Irish Sea as the border between Britain and Ireland\n\nThis morning Arlene Foster, Steve Baker and the Labour and Tory rebels know what they have to do. They must untie Boris's hands, step away from the ditch and bring a nation and its Prime Minister back from the dead.\n\nWestiminster's Extinction Rebellion protests are giving some MPs malign inspiration.\n\n'This is the sort of stuff we should be doing to the Supreme Court Justices,' one ERG Spartan fumed to me.\n\n'Let's turn up outside their offices and see how they like a few eggs being thrown at their front door.'\n\nThe sooner we get that deal done, the better.\n\nSeat deal: A Minister suggests plans are afoot to cut a deal with Nigel Farage by No. 10\n\nHopes of a Brexit breakthrough are rising. But I understand that if the talks eventually collapse, Boris Johnson is thinking the unthinkable.\n\n'Downing Street are working up plans for cutting a seat deal with Nigel Farage,' a Minister reveals.\n\n'Dom Cummings opposes it, and thinks we should just neutralise the Brexit Party by writing a hard commitment to No Deal into the manifesto.\n\nBut that would cause such a massive rebellion, Boris is wary of it. So he thinks the only other option might be to come to an arrangement with the Brexit Party.'\n\nBrexit Party officials have confirmed to me they would be willing to consider a pact, but it would require a firm commitment to stand down in specific seats.\n\n'A simple non-aggression deal wouldn't work,' a party insider says.\n\n'In a lot of these seats, you could put a blue rosette on a gorilla and 30 per cent of the electorate would vote for it.\n\n'We'd need them to step back and give us a clear run.'\n\nI'm told the seat that would prove the litmus test for a putative agreement would be Peterborough, where the Brexit Party came second in June's by-election.\n\n'The key to the whole thing is Peterborough,' my source tells me. 'If they step aside for us there, we're in business.'\n\nIf Farage suddenly pops up in Peterborough's Laxton Square, you know the game's afoot.\n\nI understand that one of new Sports Minister Nigel Adams's first requests was for some pictures of sporting World Cup winners Bobby Moore, Martin Johnson and Eoin Morgan to line the walls of his office.\n\nBut the cost-conscious Civil Service bureaucracy meant the request was taking too long to process. 'It takes ages to get new private office spending through these days,' a colleague says.\n\n'In the end, Nigel just forked out and put them up himself.'
