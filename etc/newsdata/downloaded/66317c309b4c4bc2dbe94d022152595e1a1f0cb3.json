This year it marks its 10th anniversary, on Saturday, 12 October.\n\nThe photographers of When Saturday Comes magazine have been documenting the game for the past 15 years and here we present a small selection from their archive.\n\nImage copyright Colin McPherson Image caption Two Matlock Town fans read the matchday programme before the FA Cup Third Round Qualifying round tie against Eastwood Town at Causeway Lane, Matlock, in 2010.
