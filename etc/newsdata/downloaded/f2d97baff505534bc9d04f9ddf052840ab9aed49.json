Biden, then a senator for Delaware, was the only senator to vote against the measure, which passed 94-1.\n\nThe op-ed was recently unearthed and shared by the presidential campaign of one of Biden's rivals, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who pressed him on it at Wednesday's debate.\n\n.@JoeBiden op-ed in 1981: Expanding the childcare tax credit and allowing more women to work would subsidize \"the deterioration of the family.\" Those are his words.

However, his op-ed went beyond that debate and included comments that seem to disparage the entire idea of paid child care, saying it allows parents to avoid \"responsibility\" for raising their children.\n\n\"Too many Americans \u2014 especially members of my generation \u2014 go out of their way to avoid individual responsibility for themselves and for their families,\" Biden wrote. \"That is a shame. But a recent act of Congress puts the federal government in the position, through the tax codes, of subsidizing the deterioration of the family. That is tragic.\"\n\nBiden also worried that \"upper income\" parents would take advantage of the tax credit to make more unnecessary purchases, calling it \"the perfect example of the materialism that has stricken our society.\"\n\n\"I do not believe the federal government should be a party to a system which encourages couples to place their children in day-care centers in order to acquire material possessions that go far beyond any family basic necessities,\" Biden wrote.\n\n\"Maybe I'm a little too old-fashioned, but I still believe the old adage that 'blood is blood thick, mine are mine, and I'm responsible for them.'\"\n\nThe op-ed at no point singled out mothers or said which parent should stay home to care for children. According to an Indianapolis Star report at the time, which HuffPost resurfaced, Biden said in separate remarks, \"I do not care whether in a modern marriage you want the man or the woman to take that responsibility. That has to be resolved by each couple individually.\"\n\nBut data from the Pew Research Center shows that most stay-at-home parents are women; back in 1989, only 4% of stay-at-home parents were dads.\n\nGillibrand targeted Biden over the op-ed at Wednesday's debate, claiming that he blamed working women for the deterioration of families, even though he didn't exactly use those words.\n\n\"What he wrote in the op-ed was that he believed that women working outside the home would 'create the deterioration of family,'\" Gillibrand said. \"He also said that women who were working outside the home were 'avoiding responsibility.'\"\n\nSen. Gillibrand calls Biden's 1981 op-ed \"disturbing\"\n\nBiden pushed back on Gillibrand and pointed that he, at one point, was a single parent after the death of his first wife, Neilia, in 1972.\n\nAfter the debate, Gillibrand said it was clear who would have been hurt by Biden's views back then.\n\n\"Give me a break. Who in 1981 was going to be staying home to watch the children?\" she told CNN. \"It's obvious. It's typically, in most families, women. Women are still primary caregivers.\"\n\nBiden has advocated for child care assistance in his 2020 campaign, and said each parent should receive an $8,000 tax credit for it.", "description": "An op-ed Biden wrote nearly 40 years ago became a point of contention in last night's debate.
