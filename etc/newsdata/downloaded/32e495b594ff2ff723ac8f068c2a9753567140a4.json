The U.S. also warned that any individuals or entities engaging with them risk being blacklisted as well, including banks losing access to dollar markets.\n\nWhile the initial designations, which aim to stop Ankara\u2019s incursion into Syria, are limited, the executive order signed by President Trump authorizes the U.S. Treasury Department to issue a broad range of sanctions. That could pose more significant consequences to multinational companies\u2014especially if the Treasury imposes more sanctions on Turkish government bodies, industries, companies and individuals, according to sanctions lawyers.\n\nSeveral U.S. lawmakers also are preparing legislation to place sanctions on Turkey. Last week, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said in a tweet that he had reached a bipartisan agreement to impose sanctions on Turkey. The tweet also included a proposed list of sanctions, including sanctions against the Turkish energy sector.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

The country reimposed sanctions on Iran after the U.S. pulled out of a 2015 nuclear accord. The U.S. also has used sanctions to pressure Venezuelan leaders that the U.S. considers illegitimate.\n\nSanctions on Turkey could pose a new level of compliance challenges for companies because of the size of the Turkish economy and its integration with the global economy.\n\n\u201cThis is a major G-20 economy,\u201d said Adam M. Smith, a sanctions lawyer at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP.\n\n\u201cSo long as you\u2019re going after jurisdictions that big and integrated, the knock-on effect of the consequence will be broad,\u201d he said.\n\nVolkswagen AG on Tuesday delayed approval of a new car plant in Turkey. Meanwhile, Siemens AG , which has about 3,000 employees in Turkey, said it is watching the events but doesn\u2019t yet see a direct impact on its business.\n\nHarsher U.S. sanctions on Turkey\u2019s energy sector would have a \u201csignificant detrimental impact\u201d for TransAtlantic Petroleum Ltd. , a publicly listed energy producer, because the company derives all of its revenue from Turkey, said Malone Mitchell, the company\u2019s chief executive and chairman.\n\n\u201cSanctions affecting the domestic producers would not be meaningful and probably have negligible impact for Turkey and a significant detrimental impact for the U.S. companies operating in the country,\u201d Mr. Mitchell said.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces U.S. economic sanctions, has issued three general licenses related to the Turkey sanctions, including one that allows a 30-day wind-down period for companies to end transactions or activities that involve Turkey\u2019s ministries of energy or defense.\n\nCompanies doing business in Turkey should make sure that their arrangements there have contractual protections and exit rights, if the situation changes further, according to Jonathan Cross, a sanctions lawyer at Herbert Smith Freehills. Companies also should take a look at their exposure and maintain robust sanctions-compliance procedures in relation to Turkey.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re imposing on a jurisdiction that is as substantial as Russia or Turkey, it\u2019s very difficult to immediately unwind,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cIt seems that companies would need to take advantage of this general license to unwind properly.\u201d\n\nTransAtlantic Petroleum, which produces oil and gas, has been operating in Turkey for more than a decade and has employees in the Kurdish region of Turkey, according to Mr. Mitchell. Company executives had a conference call Tuesday to discuss the latest U.S. actions.\n\nThe company\u2019s operations are ongoing as normal, Mr. Mitchell said, and it continues to monitor the situation to make sure the company remains in compliance.\n\nIt has reached out to the U.S. State Department and legislators, Mr. Mitchell said, hoping to maintain a dialogue on the petroleum industry in Turkey, which he said relies heavily on imports for its energy use.\n\n\u201cEvery normal person is concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 11 years of good relationship, and we hope to have ongoing relationships.\u201d\n\nThe company hopes that any temporary actions would be resolved through the political process.\n\nThe \u201cU.S. and Turkey have been long-term allies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll comply with whatever actions by the U.S. or Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u2014Nina Trentmann contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com", "description": "Companies conducting business in Turkey are bracing for possibly more restrictions and lost revenue in the wake of President Trump\u2019s authorization of new sanctions on the country\u2014a move that could further complicate compliance as geopolitical tensions grow.", "authors": ["Mengqi Sun", "Mengqi.Sun Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-117762/social", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
