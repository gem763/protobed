Why? Because it lies at the intersection of its employment, competitiveness and industrial performance. It impacts citizens as both workers and consumers.\n\nBut Europe spends 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan every year on research and development. It also has a fragmented market made up of 28 member states. The question facing the new European policymakers is: what innovation policies should the EU pursue to make sure it remains competitive and able to build challengers to countries like the US, Japan and South Korea?\n\nQuestions to be addressed include:\n\n\u2022 What can the EU and member states do to create a more favourable environment to R&D and innovation?\n\n\u2022 Who invests in R&D and how? How are the EU and member states sharing this responsibility? And how do public and private investment interact?\n\n\u2022 The U.S. and China fund a lot of research via military and space programs among others. How can the EU and its member states fund innovation to compete? Is there a different \u201cEuropean way\u201d to innovation?\n\n\u2022 Should the EU\u2019s new industrial policy put more money in research, education, innovation?\n\n\u2022 What is the role of intellectual property law and standards in fostering research and innovation? Is Europe using it in a way that incentivizes innovation?\n\nThis POLITICO event is gathering policymakers, analyst and business leaders to unfold the intricacies of the EU\u2019s innovation policy mix and how it affects the Continent\u2019s competitiveness on the world stage.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Innovation-Finding-Europe\u2019s-Path-to-Global-Competitiveness-1-2320x400-px-1200x400.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
