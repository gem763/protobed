There's tree limbs in the road. There's no green shrubbery left. It's just shredded,\" Bruce Sawyer, a resident of the hard-hit Abaco Islands told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" after enduring a night of abject uncertainty and fear.\n\n(MORE: As Hurricane Dorian approaches US, tips to keep in mind if you're evacuating)\n\nDorian made landfall Sunday afternoon at Elbow Cay of the Abaco Islands as the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall on record, and witnesses like Sawyer, who have chosen to shelter in place for other major hurricanes, said they've never seen anything like it.\n\nPHOTO: Uprooted trees, fallen power lines and the debris from damaged houses scatter on a road as Hurricane Dorian sweeps through Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, Sept. 1, 2019.

The windows were caving. The doors were caving in. I honestly thought that our roof was going to be ripped off as well.\"\n\nABC News correspondent Marcus Moore and his news crew hunkered down in a hotel in the Abaco Islands -- and by Monday morning, he said their hotel appeared to be the only structure still standing in the immediate area.\n\n(MORE: What to know about hurricane categories and the Saffir-Simpson wind scale)\n\n\"It really is a catastrophe here. And riding through this Category 5 hurricane was something I have never done before. I\u2019ve covered many hurricanes but none like this one -- we\u2019re talking about land speeds of 180 mph-plus and then 200 mph wind gusts,\" Moore said. \"The feeling really moves you. As the winds were blowing, our ears were popping.\"\n\n\"You could hear the wind, you could hear bits and pieces of debris and large objects hitting the building, including a boat,\" Moore said. \"A yacht hit our building and right now is resting up against the three-story condo complex where we have been staying.\"\n\nMoore said he could also hear people screaming through the night.\n\n(MORE: Coastal communities issue mandatory evacuation in preparation of Hurricane Dorian)\n\nKim Mullins, a resident of Grand Bahama Island, told \"GMA\" she lived through Hurricane Floyd in 1999, Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004, Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Irma in 2017. But she said Hurricane Dorian is the most menacing beast yet.\n\n\"The winds, they sound crazy. It literally feels as though something is about to happen even though my house is secure,\" Mullins said.
