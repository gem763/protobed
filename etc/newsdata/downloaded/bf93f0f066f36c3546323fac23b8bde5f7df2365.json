Rodrigo was left unchecked to race onto Daniel Parejo\u2019s free kick and volley into the net in the 74th minute at Stamford Bridge.\n\n\u201cI never felt alone, I always felt the players support,\u201d said Celades, a former defensive midfielder for Barcelona and Real Madrid. \u201cWe have to make sure the noise outside doesn\u2019t affect us and work on things that will help us win matches.\u201d\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, has to work on its defense.\n\nRodrigo\u2019s strike was the 14th goal Chelsea has conceded in the seven games in all competitions since Frank Lampard took charge of the club he won the Champions League with as a player in 2012.\n\nChelsea fans were given a reason to cheer minutes after conceding, when a penalty was awarded after a VAR review saw referee C\u00fcneyt \u00c7akir go over to the pitchside screen to verify that Fikayo Tomori\u2019s header hit the hand of Daniel Wass.\n\nBut it was not usual penalty taker Jorginho or Willian who took the spot kick. After a conversation with Willian, Ross Barkley pointed to his chest before going up to the spot.\n\nAnd those earlier celebrations were short-lived as Barkley\u2019s kick clipped the crossbar and flew over.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take it,\u201d Willian said. \u201cBut he was confident to take it. It is football and he missed the penalty.\u201d\n\nLampard sought to downplay any issues within the team over the penalty taker, saying Barkley assumed the role when he came off the bench.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the conversation was,\u201d Lampard said, \u201cbut Jorginho and Willian were penalty takers until Ross came on the pitch.\u201d\n\nChelsea had an early blow when midfielder Mason Mount limped off with an ankle injury only 15 minutes into his Champions League debut, having initially played on after former Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin launched his left foot at the midfielder\u2019s right shin.\n\n\u201cIt was a shame,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing well and he started this game well.\u201d\n\nMount was replaced by Pedro Rodr\u00edguez, with American summer signing Christian Pulisic overlooked by Lampard and not making it of the bench for a second straight game.\n\nIn the other game in Group H, last season\u2019s semifinalist Ajax beat Lille 3-0.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rodrigo allowed Valencia to shake off a week of upheaval behind the scenes to clinch a 1-0 victory at Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rob Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/britain_soccer_champions_league_81938_c0-165-2000-1331_s1770x1032.jpg?aea1204ca6a4ff68cd6e2644e09c5172f67238fe", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
