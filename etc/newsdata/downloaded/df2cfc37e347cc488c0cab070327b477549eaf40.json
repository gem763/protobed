He is seen being helped by a woman, who tries to relieve his pain by wiping his face with clean water.\n\nThe harrowing images was taken yesterday after an unauthorised demonstration sparked more clashes in the 21st straight weekend of anti-government unrest in the financial hub.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nA child reacts after anti-riot police fired tear gas to disperse protesters at an unauthorised rally in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nA woman tries to relieve his pain by wiping his face with clean water while more passersby console the child in Hong Kong\n\nThe child was tear gassed when police tried to crack down on an illegal gathering organised to condemn police brutality\n\nA man puts a gas mask on a young boy after police fired tear gas to disperse pro-democracy protesters in the Tsim Sha Tsui\n\nThe pro-democracy protest began yesterday afternoon in Tsim Sha Tsui, a major tourist strip.\n\nHundreds of demonstrators joined the illegal gathering to condemn what they called police brutality as well as the officers' use of 'chemical weapons' during crackdowns.\n\nThe rally quickly turned ugly as police used tear gas to disperse protesters, leading to hours of ugly confrontations in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.\n\nProtesters barricaded roads, hurled firebombs and set a subway entrance on fire as they used hit-and-run tactics against phalanxes of riot police.\n\nTwo journalists were reportedly hurt after being hit by non-lethal rounds by police and another photographer was taken away by officers during yesterday's clashes.\n\nA protester reacts to tear gas during a confrontation with police in Hong Kong in the 21st straight weekend of the unrest\n\nHong Kong police fired tear gas on Sunday to disperse protesters who were condemning what they called police brutality in months-long demonstrations. Protesters barricaded roads, hurled firebombs and set a subway entrance on fire\n\nHong Kong enters recession due to unrest Hong Kong has fallen into recession and is unlikely to achieve any growth this year, the city's Financial Secretary said. The financial hub has been hit by more than four months of anti-government protests that show no signs of relenting. 'The blow to our economy is comprehensive,' Paul Chan said in a blog post, adding that a preliminary estimate for third-quarter GDP on Thursday would show two successive quarters of contraction - the technical definition of a recession. He also said it would be 'extremely difficult' to achieve the government's pre-protest forecast of 0-1 per cent annual economic growth.\n\nThe programming staff union of public broadcaster RTHK said on Monday it had called on police to identify officers who 'attacked and ripped the face mask' off one of its journalists on Sunday. It said she was wearing a reflective vest clearly identifying herself as a journalist.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if she was wearing a gas mask to protect against tear gas and pepper spray. Ordinary face masks were banned this month under a resurrected colonial-era emergency law.\n\nHong Kong Free Press, an online news service, called for the release of a freelance photographer arrested on Sunday.\n\nThe city's Foreign Correspondents' Club condemned the arrest in a statement on Monday calling for an independent investigation into 'police violence against journalists and interference with the media's right to cover the protests under Hong Kong law'.\n\nThe police, who deny using excessive force in life-threatening situations, were due to hold a news conference later on Monday.\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong have taken to the streets for more than four months, in a movement sparked by concern about an unpopular China extradition bill that has since snowballed to include wider demands for political reform.\n\nProtesters are seen in a police vehicle after being detained during an unauthorised demonstration in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nA protester dressed as super hero character Captain America walks along the street during a rally in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nPolice officers restrain protesters during a rally in Hong Kong on Sunday after more clashed broke out in the city centre\n\nProtesters, who called the latest rally over concerns about police conduct, were met at the rally by a heavy police presence, which only ratcheted up the tensions. They yelled 'Gangster cops, death to your whole family.'\n\nPolice have faced criticism for using heavy-handed tactics including tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and a water cannon to subdue protesters. On occasion they have fired live rounds, wounding a teenage activist in the chest last month. But police say they're the ones who are victims of violence, having been on the receiving end of hurled bricks and firebombs.\n\nThis month, an 18-year-old was charged with intentional wounding for a slashing attack on a riot officer.\n\nA journalist is assisted after getting hit by pepper spray during a rally in Hong Kong on Sunday. Two reporters are said to have been injured after being hit by non-lethal rounds and one freelance photographer was taken away by officers yesterday\n\nA man walks past the entrance of a subway station which has been set on fire by hard-line anti-government protesters\n\na team of heavily armed police officers run on a street as they confront protesters during a rally in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nHong Kong police officers push back journalists during a rally against alleged police brutality in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nAt Sunday's rally, some protesters threw umbrellas and other objects at riot police, who responded with tear gas, bringing traffic on a main road to a standstill.\n\nProtesters ripped up bricks from the sidewalk and scattered them on the streets to block cars.\n\nSome protesters reportedly took refuge across the street in the luxury Peninsula Hotel, which promptly lowered its shutters.\n\nMany protesters moved to the nearby Chungking Mansions, a focal point for South Asian residents and businesses, where they continued to face off with police, bringing the normally bustling Nathan Road tourist strip to a standstill.\n\nThey were showing support for the former British colony's ethnic and religious minorities - another aim of the rally - after police used a water cannon to spray a mosque and bystanders with a stinging blue-dyed liquid the previous weekend.\n\nA man is restrained by police during a rally in Hong Kong on Sunday as the anti-government unrest shows no sign of ending\n\nResidents react to tear gas on a street on Sunday after police used the crowd-control weapon to disperse demonstrators\n\nHong Kong police officers patrol Hong Kong on Sunday after hundreds rallied to condemn what they call police brutality\n\nA Hong Kong police officer holds a weapon during a clash with protesters at an illegal gathering in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nPolice briefly used the cannon on a nearby street, but it appeared to be filled with ordinary water this time. The police dispersal operation lasted late into the night, as police engulfed streets in tear gas and called the protesters 'rioters' for taking part in an 'unauthorized assembly.'\n\nHong Kong's protest movement shows no signs of cooling even after the government formally withdrew the unpopular China extradition bill on Wednesday, giving in to one of the movement's demands.\n\n'Because the problem is much more than before,' said a protester who only gave his name as Nephets, citing heavy-handed police tactics. 'We can see the future is controlled by China. We can see all the rules and even the law is starting to be controlled by the China government. For the Hong Kong people, there's no say over our land and that is the problem.'\n\nNephets, who said he was 40 and worked in media, said he attended protests in support of younger hardcore protesters who have led violent confrontations with police.\n\nDespite repeated government appeals for people not to side with mobs involved in vandalism, throwing gasoline bombs and other violence, the protest movement is still rousing determined support from more moderate demonstrators. They're broadly worried about the future and freedoms of the city that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with promises from Beijing that it would largely be its own boss, its way of life unchanged.", "description": "Heart-breaking pictures have emerged of a little child grimacing in agony on a street of Hong Kong after being tear gassed by anti-riot officers during a rally against alleged police brutality yesterday.", "authors": ["Billie Thomson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20272164-0-image-a-23_1572256137225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
