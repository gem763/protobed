She\u2019s afraid of being penalized for her fame, but it looks like prosecutors may be making a good faith effort to treat each defendant fairly.\"\n\nHowever, there are stark differences in the stars' approaches to their own cases.\n\nHuffman, 56, tearfully pleaded guilty on Monday to paying an admissions consultant $15,000 to have a proctor correct her older daughter's answers on the SAT. She reportedly considered the same for her younger daughter but decided against it.\n\nMOSSIMO GIANNULLI NEVER ENROLLED IN USC, USED PARENTS' TUITION MONEY\n\nCOLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL TV SERIES IN THE WORKS\n\nThe assistant U.S. attorney recommended four months of prison time, 12 months of supervised release and a $20,000 fine for the \"Desperate Housewives\" actress.\n\nLoughlin, 54, and husband Mossimo Giannulli were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to William \"Rick\" Singer to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella into the University of Southern California (USC). Singer reportedly had Olivia Isabella enrolled as crew team recruits, despite neither girl being a coxswain.\n\nUSC CREW TEAM POSTERS MOCKED AFTER LORI LOUGHLIN, OLIVIA JADE COLLEGE SCANDAL\n\nGiannulli and Loughlin were each arrested and released on $1 million bonds. They rejected the plea agreement that Huffman accepted and were subsequently hit with additional charges of conspiracy and money laundering. They now each face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of all counts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThough Loughlin is reportedly terrified of a potential prison sentence, sources previously claimed that she feels she was \"manipulated\" by Singer and believes a trial is the only way to clear her name. However, she now faces a new obstacle she may not have expected: Laura Janke, a former assistant soccer coach at USC pleaded guilty Tuesday to creating fake athletic profiles for the children of wealthy parents, including Giannulli and Loughlin's daughters \u2014 and she may be called to testify against the actress and her fashion designer husband.\n\nFox News' Mariah Haas and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Lori Loughlin thinks her television success may put a target on her back in the college admissions scandal.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/03/12/694940094001_6013071299001_6013070629001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-15"}
