Pulisic became the first American to score more than two goals in a single game in the Premier League since Clint Dempsey had a hat trick in 2012 for Fulham against Newcastle.\n\nThe first two goals were impressive solo scores. For the first goal, Pulisic put the ball to the back post off a shifty move and left-footed kick to become the 22nd American to score a goal in the Premier League.\n\nAfter scoring Pulisic erupted in emotion, capturing the meaning of his first score.\n\nJust gonna drop this Pulisic goal video here for y'all\n\n\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac.\u25d9.\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\u2550\u2582\u2584\u2584\u2593\u2584\u2584\u2582\n\n\u25e2\u25e4\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2584\u2584\u2584\u2584\u25e2\u25e4\n\n\u2588\u2584 \u2588 \u2588\u2584\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u256c\n\n\u25e5\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u25e4\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c __\ud83d\ude05\n\n\u256c\u2550\u256c/ \\ \\\\\n\n\u26bd\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/zRB9CFviXY \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) October 26, 2019\n\nOn the second goal shortly before the half, he pulled away from defenders and found the net with a right-footed kick.\n\nOn the third, Pulisic scored off a header in the second half to record the hat trick.\n\nPULISIC HATTRICK AHHHHH pic.twitter.com/UPNktW4pBp \u2014 NBC Sports Soccer (@NBCSportsSoccer) October 26, 2019\n\nPulisic became the fourth player 21 years of age or younger to score a perfect hat trick in the Premier League, according to ESPN Stats & Info.\n\nPulisic played strong as a substitute in Chelsea's Champions League win at Ajax earlier this week, helping the 21-year-old up-and-comer earn the start Saturday where he replaced Callum Hudson-Odoi.\n\nChelsea manager Frank Lampard told reporters Friday: \"The way he's played, he deserves a starting place regularly in the last few weeks, but so do others and that's what I keep saying is the nice problem that I have. But it's brilliant that he's coming on and making the impact that he's making and of course he'll get his starts, that's the reason he's come here.\"\n\nMORE SOCCER:\n\nMLS PLAYOFFS: Ibrahimovi\u0107 grabs crotch, stares down LAFC fan following loss\n\nALEX MORGAN: Announces she and her husband expecting daughter in April\n\nREPORT: Reign FC coach Andonovski to be named coach of USWNT", "description": "U.S. men's national soccer team winger Christian Pulisic joined Chelsea's starting lineup Saturday at Burnley and made the most of it.", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published P.M.
