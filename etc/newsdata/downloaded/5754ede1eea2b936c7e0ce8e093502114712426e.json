These brave women and men saved lives \u2014 and if not for their quick action, we know the destruction would have been much worse.\u201d\n\nAt least one death has been attributed to the Saddleridge fire, a man who authorities said suffered a heart attack while trying to fight encroaching flames on his property rather than heeding evacuation orders.\n\nTwo firefighters suffered minor injuries, the LAFD said, and 31 structures have been either damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe cause of the blaze was under investigation.\n\nThe Saddleridge is the largest among a spate of wildfires across Southern California.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Firefighters battle a wind-driven wildfire called the Saddle Ridge fire in the early morning hours Friday in Porter Ranch, California, U.S., October 11, 2019.
