It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nNo matter where we are in the economic cycle, it\u2019s always good to remind ourselves of what worked and what didn\u2019t. In 2017, Wall Street forecast a rough yea,r but quite the opposite happened. Benchmark indices hit all-time records, while investors ended up being upbeat about most sectors.\n\nIn 2018, the long-running bull market took a breather as investors switched from risk-on to risk-off.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis year so far has only been a little forgiving and that might not last, which is why I recommend that investors get selective. Fortunately, with dividend stocks, investors don\u2019t have to feel pressured to always pick winners.\n\nAlthough picking high-flying growth companies is a sexier endeavor, they aren\u2019t always the smartest stocks to buy. With passive-income yielding firms, you get the potential to make capital gains and obtain residual payouts to bolster your position. During a down period, dividends can also help you ride out the storm.\n\nBut don\u2019t mistake benefiting from these yields as \u201cboring\u201d strategies. As with any asset class, you can dial up the risk for the chance of greater rewards.. No one knows your investment style better than you!\n\nThe following ideas are broken down into three sections: stable, mid-level and high-yield (speculative). Each section has something to offer, depending on how much risk you\u2019re willing to take.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ)\n\nCurrent Dividend Yield: 2.9%\n\nIf you love stable dividend stocks, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the best dividend stocks to buy. It is the powerhouse brand of powerhouse brands. Better yet, JNJ is levered toward the ultimate in non-cyclical industries: healthcare. Selling consumer-level products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, JNJ is one of the most respected companies in the world.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCurrently, Johnson & Johnson\u2019s dividend yield is 2.9%. But what people may not immediately appreciate is that JNJ can also surprise people in the capital markets. For instance, since mid-2015, shares are up nearly 40%.\n\nCritically for conservative investors, JNJ rarely loses. Between 1970 to the end of 2018, annual returns average almost 15%. Moreover, JNJ only hit red ink 14 times, meaning that 72% of the time, you can expect shares to win.\n\nIn our business, that\u2019s as close to a sure thing as you\u2019re gonna get!\n\n\n\n\n\nWells Fargo (WFC)\n\nCurrent Dividend Yield: 4.22%\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I wasn\u2019t thrilled about putting Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) into my dividend stocks to buy list. You\u2019ll recall that WFC was embroiled in a major controversy that shocked the entire financial and business community. Essentially, the banking giant admitted to creating more than two million fake accounts to meet ambitious sales targets.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (WFC) More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIt made me sick and I\u2019m not the only one. But eventually, people get over this stuff, perhaps resigned to the fact that the major conglomerates always win. I even made the argument that Equifax Inc (NYSE:EFX) \u2014 yes, that Equifax \u2014 would be forgiven.\n\nAs cynical as it may sound, what good will being angry do for any of us? Today Equifax is just around a few percent off its pre-scandal highs, and Wells Fargo is now above its pre-scandal highs.\n\nIt stinks that the ultra-rich get away with bloody murder. From a financial perspective, though, WFC is an opportunity. It\u2019s slowly making recovery inroads. Most important, WFC spits out the biggest dividend yield among the \u201cbig four\u201d at more than 4%. That may be the price of forgiveness!", "description": "[Editor's note: \"9 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for Every Investor\" was previously published in July 2019.
