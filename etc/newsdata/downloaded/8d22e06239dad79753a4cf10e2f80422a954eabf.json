Indonesia Cuts Key Rate Again, Says Future Moves Depend on Data\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Indonesia\u2019s central bank cut its for a fourth straight month amid a deteriorating outlook for global growth, saying any further moves would depend on incoming economic data.\n\nBank Indonesia lowered the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 5% Thursday, as predicted by 23 out of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest had forecast no change.\n\n\u201cThe decision is in line with an inflation estimate that remains under control and investment yields that remain attractive, also as a pre-emptive step to push the domestic economy amid a slowing global economy,\u201d Governor Perry Warjiyo told reporters in Jakarta.\n\nWhile the bank\u2019s policy stance remains generally accommodative, its future course will \u201cbe data dependent from one month to another,\u201d he said.\n\nThursday\u2019s easing comes after the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for global growth and cut its 2019 projection for Indonesia to 5% from 5.2% in July. Despite signs of an impending deal between the U.S. and China, the trade war between the two behemoths is continuing to weigh on Indonesia\u2019s economy, which grew at its slowest pace in two years in the second quarter.\n\nSupporting Growth\n\n\u201cThe move to cut rates again is aimed at supporting the growth momentum in the face of slowing retail sales, falling automotive sales and sluggish investment,\u201d said Josua Pardede, an economist at PT Bank Permata in Jakarta. \u201cDepending on GDP growth in the third quarter of this year, we think the room for another BI policy rate cut is still open in the following months.\u201d\n\nBank Indonesia raised interest rates by 175 basis points last year as it battled an emerging-market rout that was pressuring Indonesia\u2019s currency, but this year its focus has shifted to supporting growth.\n\nThe was up 1% as of 3:12 p.m. local time, but didn\u2019t move much on the decision. The , which has gained 2.5% against the dollar this year, fell 0.1% to 14,045 per dollar after the decision. Yields on 10-year government bonds pared an earlier drop and were little changed on the day at 7.08%.\n\nGareth Leather, a senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, said the likelihood of rising global risk aversion -- which could scare investors away from emerging-market currencies like the rupiah -- might limit Bank Indonesia\u2019s options going forward.\n\n\u201cGiven Indonesia\u2019s high level of foreign currency debt, we doubt the central bank would want to cut aggressively\u201d in such a scenario, Leather said.\n\nForecasts Stable\n\nIndonesian policy makers remain comfortable with a relatively subdued inflation environment that has allowed them to lower borrowing costs since July. Consumer prices rose 3.39% in September from a year ago, well within Bank Indonesia\u2019s target band of 2.5%-4.5% for this year.\n\nThe bank kept its economic forecasts broadly unchanged from last month:\n\nGross domestic product growth is seen below the midpoint of the 5%-5.4% forecast range, and is set to move toward the midpoint of a 5.1%-5.5% range for 2020\n\nInflation this year will likely come in below the midpoint of the 2.5%-4.5% target range, and stay within the 2%-4% range in 2020\n\nThe current-account deficit should be around 2.5%-3% of GDP this year and next\n\n\u201cBI\u2019s rate cut today was no surprise given the combination of sluggish growth, benign inflation and a reasonably stable\u201d rupiah, said Krystal Tan, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. \u201cAs long as external stability is maintained, the bias is probably toward a deeper easing cycle.\u201d", "description": "Indonesia Cuts Key Rate Again, Says Future Moves Depend on Data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAA06C_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
