In particular, they are touting the mini martini as the next big thing on the cocktail scene and selling the perennially popular drink in versions that are about half the common pour of 3.5 ounces or more.\n\nThe idea, bar operators say, is that today\u2019s customer often wants to drink in moderation, particularly on weeknights.\n\nThose customers, however, aren\u2019t willing to forgo their martini altogether.\n\nThe mini version is \u201csomething less alcoholic but highly elegant,\u201d said Ryan Gavin, bar manager at Peppi\u2019s Cellar, a Nolita establishment that serves an Italian-inspired 1.5-ounce martini for $4 strictly as a happy-hour special.\n\nA full-size version, with 3.5 ounces, runs $8 during happy hour and $16 at other times.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that customers stop at one drink, operators say. If anything, the mini martini is almost designed to invite patrons to have another, but still keep their revelry in check.\n\n\u201cIt brings back the three-martini lunch, but in a different way,\u201d said Salvatore Tafuri, bar director at the Loyal, a West Village establishment.\n\nThe Loyal offers a 2.5-ounce martini during happy hour for $10.\n\nAt the Morgan Caf\u00e9 at the Morgan Library & Museum, the mini martini can be ordered only as part of a trio, a $14 menu item playfully billed as the Three-Martini Lunch. It features three 2-ounce offerings of the drink, with each garnished in a different way.\n\n\u201cGuests feel they\u2019re enjoying three different cocktails without a sense of excess,\u201d said Patricia Japngie, an operations director with Restaurant Associates, the hospitality company that manages the Morgan\u2019s food-and-beverage program.\n\nIn some ways, the interest in the mini martini also speaks to the ever-burgeoning interest in pre-Prohibition drinks, said David Wondrich, a cocktail expert and historian.\n\nWhen the martini first became popular in the late 19th century, it was generally offered in pours smaller than 3 ounces, Mr. Wondrich said. That started to change over time, particularly during the post-World War II \u201cMad Men\u201d era of heavier drinking, he noted.\n\nThe trend has been difficult to reverse\u2014at least up until now.\n\n\u201cIt becomes harder to offer smaller martinis because then you\u2019re looked at as being cheap,\u201d Mr. Wondrich said.\n\nBut these days, drinking establishments increasingly have found themselves responding to demand for lower-alcohol options, to say nothing of the growing interest in alcohol-free \u201cmocktails.\u201d There are even alcohol-free \u201cbars\u201d popping up in New York City.\n\nThe mini-martini movement has spread beyond the martini\u2014or at least the traditional gin or vodka version.\n\nAt Paper Daisy in the East Village, a mini espresso martini is now featured on the brunch menu. And at Don Angie in the West Village, a variety of smaller sips are concocted, including the Nonna\u2019s Little Nip with Campari , grapefruit juice and Prosecco.\n\nNonna\u2019s Little Nip\u2014Campari, grapefruit juice and Prosecco\u2014is served at Don Angie in Manhattan\u2019s West Village neighborhood.

His martinis are solid pours of at least 4 ounces.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to go out and have a drink, you should have a drink,\u201d Mr. Conway said.", "description": "Cocktail lovers take note: Your martini may be shrinking.", "authors": ["Charles Passy"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106640/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
