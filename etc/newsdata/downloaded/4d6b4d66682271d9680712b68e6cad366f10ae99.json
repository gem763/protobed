apps meant to encourage users to minimize their smartphone usage.\n\nThe apps are part of the company\u2019s \u2018Digital Wellbeing\u2019 initiative, which aims to ensure \u2018life, not the technology in it, stays front and center.\u2019\n\nGoogle describes the apps as 'experiments' and with their release the company is encouraging other Android developers to think of their own unique ways to enhance users lives instead of distract from them.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nGoogle's Unlock Clock (pictured above) will show Android users how many times they've unlocked their phone during the day before each new unlock\n\nThe first app listed on Google's Digital Wellbeing page is called Unlock Clock, a simple plugin that keeps track of how many times users unlock their phone throughout the day.\n\nEvery time they reach for their phone and unlock the home screen, they\u2019re shown a counter that displays the number of times they\u2019ve already unlocked their phone in stark white numbers.\n\nThe numbers are displayed after entering the unlock code on the homescreen and before gaining full access to the phone to make sure users see them.\n\nPost Box (pictured above) will save all a users notifications and send them as one package anywhere between one and four times a day\n\nPost Box focuses on the ways users can fixate on their phones without actually unlocking them.\n\nThe app focuses collects all users notifications from various apps and instead of sending them out one by one, saves them for a bulk delivery at set times during the day.\n\nYou can have notifications delivered as few as once and as many as four times each day, and the app can be disabled at any time in case of emergencies or important occasions.\n\nWe Flip (pictured above) lets friends in the same room add their names to an app that times how long the group stays off their phone and lists who in the group was first to pick their phone back up again\n\nWe Flip enlists a user's friends in a playful competition to see who can avoid looking at their phone for the longest.\n\nIt\u2019s meant to encourage groups of friends to focus on each other instead of their phones when they\u2019re together.\n\nUsers join the app and at the same time everyone flips a switch to turn their screens off.\n\nA timer then keeps track of who in the group was the first person to look at their phone and how look it took before they checked.\n\nPaper Phone (pictured above) lets users print a paper version of all the relevant information from their phone that they'll need on any given day\n\nPaper Phone is another unique option that lets users select which apps they\u2019d like to use during the upcoming day, and then print all the relevant information from those apps on a sheet of paper they can carry throughout the day.\n\nUsers can select a handful of contacts whose address or emails might be needed, map directions to a specific location, daily lesson from a language learning app, or a new crossword to work on during a commute.\n\nDesert Island (pictured above) creates a minimalist interface that only gives users access to the apps they choose as essential\n\nDesert Island asks users to pick a handful of their most essential apps, say, Gmail, Camera and Calendar, and then blocks access to all other apps on the phone.\n\nWhenever users unlock their phone they see a white minimalist background that shows a list of only those apps they\u2019ve selected as important.\n\nMorph (pictured above) lets users create groups of apps to make available at different times throughout the day or week, such as work-related apps during work hours, entertainment apps in the evenings, or travel-related apps during holidays\n\nSimilarly, Morph allows users to create groups of essential apps for different times of day or different days of the week.\n\nUsers can list a small number of apps to show during the work day, a different set of apps to make available for home use, and another set of apps to use during holidays.\n\nUsers can program when to transition between app groups so it happens automatically throughout the day.\n\nGoogle's Digital Wellbeing initiative wants to help ensure \u2018life, not the technology in it, stays front and center\u2019\n\nIf users would like to try and create their own wellbeing experiments, Google has posted open source code and some basic tutorial information on the Digital Wellbeing site.\n\nUsers can submit their projects to Google for review and a potential featured spot on the Digital Wellbeing site.\n\n'The more people that get involved the more we can all learn about building better technology for everyone,' Google says in a post on the website.", "description": "Today, Google released a
