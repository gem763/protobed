An independent poll of the state conducted by Emerson in August found Gardner trailing John Hickenlooper by a similar margin. Emerson had it 53/40. Today\u2019s Democratic poll has it 53/42. Normally it\u2019d be implausible for any incumbent senator to trail by double digits in a swing state, but \u2026 Colorado\u2019s not much of a swing state anymore. It\u2019s blue enough that Hillary managed to win it in 2016 when virtually every other battleground across the country was tilting towards Trump. And Gardner\u2019s not facing some rando next fall. Hickenlooper is a twice-elected governor (and before that a twice-elected mayor of Denver), probably better known to most voters there than Gardner himself is. It\u2019s certainly possible that this really is a 10-point race right now.\n\nTo think: If Hickenlooper\u2019s presidential run had gotten a tiny bit more traction, he might have been forced to stick around in the Dem primaries long enough that his window to run for Senate back home would have closed. His total failure at the national level seems likely to produce a Senate pick-up for Democrats next fall.\n\nThe poll shows that President Trump is at his lowest popularity point since he took office. Thirty-eight percent of people polled said they viewed him favorably, compared to 60% who view him unfavorably. His favorability has only been that low once in KOM polling, in March 2018; and his unfavorability was last that high in January. KOM also conducted a similar poll in June\u2026 Thirty-four percent of people polled in the latest KOM survey said they viewed Gardner favorably, compared to 45% who view him unfavorably. His favorability was lowest, and his unfavorability highest, at any point that KOM has polled that question over the past 2 \u00bd years\u2026 Fifty-four percent of respondents said they support the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, compared to 43% who oppose it. And 48% of respondents said they believe Trump should be impeached and removed from office, compared to 44% who said he should not be.\n\nSome have noted that Hickenlooper\u2019s 53/42 margin over Gardner closely matches support for the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which runs 54/43. Trump may be killing Gardner here. And if it\u2019s true that Trump\u2019s own approval rating in Colorado stands at 38/60, he might not even contest the state next fall, calculating that his resources are better spent trying to flip Minnesota.\n\nAll of this puts Gardner in a terrible bind on impeachment. More so than most of his Republican colleagues, he\u2019s damned if he votes to remove and damned if he doesn\u2019t. The poll notes that his approval is barely above water even among his own party, which means he\u2019ll basically be required to vote to acquit Trump to shore up their support. The last thing he can afford to do now is piss off his own base when he\u2019s fighting uphill against Hickenlooper, after all. But given the depth of Colorado\u2019s dislike for Trump, siding with the president is destined to cement some of the opposition to Gardner. Unaffiliated voters already favor Hickenlooper by 25 points (58/33) and 61 percent(!) of them support impeachment, which means there\u2019s no option for Gardner on impeachment and removal that probably won\u2019t cost him more votes than it\u2019ll earn him.\n\nIf these Democratic numbers remotely reflect actual reality, Gardner might be sunk next fall. It\u2019s not like the economy\u2019s going to get dramatically better between now and then to rescue him given how well it\u2019s done already during Trump\u2019s term. And in light of the past week or two, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Trump will say or do anything in the coming year that\u2019ll rehabilitate him with Coloradans.\n\nThe only silver lining here: Doug Jones is facing the same \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201d dilemma in Alabama. Vote to acquit Trump and his own party will be outraged, vote to remove and the majority of the electorate will revolt. At worst, the loss of Gardner\u2019s seat to the GOP will be offset by the gain of Jones\u2019s seat. The difference between the two senators is that Jones surely knows his time in the Senate is over and will probably vote on removal and everything else over the next 12 months the way he wants, without worrying about the political implications. Gardner\u2019s doom isn\u2019t quite as assured so he may still be susceptible to partisan pressure. For Trump\u2019s sake, he should hope Gardner gets a good poll or two between now and the removal vote to convince him to stick with the team. If he falls further behind Hickenlooper, Gardner may say \u201cto hell with it\u201d and start voting the way he wants too.\n\nIt\u2019s not all doom and gloom for Republicans in the Senate, though. I\u2019ll leave you on a sunny note with this poll from Michigan, which has challenger John James neck and neck with Democratic incumbent Gary Peters, trailing 43/40. James outperformed expectations last year in falling short against Debbie Stabenow. With Trump at the top of the ticket in a state that went red in 2016, he has a shot at a pick-up. Which is good because, with Susan Collins in the same boat as Gardner on impeachment and removal, we shouldn\u2019t count on Maine\u2019s Senate seat staying red next year either.", "description": "Landslide?", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
