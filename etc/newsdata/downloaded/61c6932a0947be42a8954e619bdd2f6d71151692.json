(AP) - There\u2019s no way to separate trailblazing nurse-midwife Mary Breckinridge from the last 100 years of Leslie County\u2019s history, so when talk arose that the owner of her historic house might move it out of the county, people got hot.\n\nBreckinridge, motivated by the death of her two young children, started working in the mountainous coal county in the 1920s to provide health care for mothers and babies in what was then an isolated corner of Appalachia, with infant death rates among the highest in the nation.\n\nRoads weren\u2019t well developed, so the nurses initially rode horses into the narrow hollows to treat people and deliver babies through what became known as the Frontier Nursing Service.\n\nBreckinridge died in 1965, but the local hospital is still named for her. So is the annual community festival. Black and white photos at Hyden City Hall commemorate the nurses on horseback, and many residents can trace being helped into the world by the Frontier Nursing Service.\n\nSo it didn\u2019t sit well with many people in the county when the organization Breckinridge founded bought property in Versailles in 2017 and began working to move there.\n\n\u201cThey turned their back on her legacy, is how people feel,\u201d said Hyden Mayor Carol Graham Joseph. \u201cEveryone here reveres Mary Breckinridge\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\nFrontier Nursing University, as the organization is now called, said it needed the larger, 67-acre campus in Central Kentucky - the former United Methodist Children\u2019s Home - to serve its growing enrollment.\n\nThe Hyden campus had hit its capacity, and traveling to Hyden \u201chas presented many challenges,\u201d FNU said in a new release at the time. The new campus is close to the Lexington airport.\n\nThe organization said the new campus would help it continue to fulfill Breckinridge\u2019s vision of educating nurses to help mothers and babies in rural and underserved areas.\n\nMoving to Versailles was a \u201cdifficult and emotional decision\u201d for the Frontier board and leaders, the president, Susan E. Stone, said in a statement.\n\nThe organization uses a distance-learning approach so has not conducted classes in Leslie County in some time, but hosts orientations and clinical sessions in Hyden, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nFNU has said it plans to move all on-campus student activities to the Versailles facility, with 2020 as the goal.\n\nFrontier has been a key employer in the county, so the loss of jobs and economic activity caused by the changes has hurt, and it will add to that when all student activities shift to Versailles, local officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a huge blow countywide,\u201d said Joel C. Brashear, an officer at Hyden Citizens Bank.\n\nDespite the changes, many Leslie County residents expected the connection to Mary Breckinridge and the Frontier Nursing Service to remain because of its historic buildings in the county.\n\nThose include the two-story log \u201cBig House\u201d that Breckinridge had built on a steep hillside overlooking the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River at Wendover, a few miles from Hyden, where she lived from the mid-1920s until her death.\n\nA history of the house says there were five inside bathtubs in the county in 1925, and the house had two of them.\n\nFrontier operates a bed and breakfast - lauded for its cooking - and retreat center in the house, which is listed as a national historic landmark.\n\nAnother beloved building with ties to Breckinridge is a stone chapel on the Frontier campus on Thousandstick Mountain overlooking Hyden, which showcases a stunning 15th Century stained glass window.\n\nConcern over the future of the buildings blew up in the county in recent days, fanned by minutes from a Frontier Nursing University board meeting in which members discussed moving Breckinridge\u2019s house.\n\nOne board member said it \u201cwould be great to be able to move the entire Big House to Versailles,\u201d according to the minutes, which also included comments about using the house for a museum and about studying the cost of moving the house or other buildings from Wendover.\n\nOne member noted the need to keep the discussions quiet \u201cso as not to alert and upset the local community,\u201d according to the minutes.\n\nFor many residents and people with local ties, the potential to lose pieces of Breckinridge\u2019s physical legacy - which spread on Facebook - was insult on top of injury, a further wedge between the county and its history.\n\nThe window in the chapel, which would be easier to move than an entire building, was one particular point of concern.\n\n\u201cThe public here is furious,\u201d Brashear said.\n\nPeople wondered if the national historic designation could be a tool to prevent moving the Big House, and there was talk of a petition against moving any property associated with Breckinridge, or maybe a protest during the festival parade.\n\nJoseph said more than 80 people called her about the issue.\n\n\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a part of our heritage,\u201d Joseph said of the house, chapel and other structures. \u201cShe (Breckinridge) built them for here. I feel like she wouldn\u2019t want her possessions to go from here.\u201d\n\nStone, the Frontier Nursing University president, acknowledged in a statement that there was a discussion about the sustainability of the Wendover campus at a recent board meeting.\n\nThe minutes indicate concern that the campus is a financial drain at a time when FNU is working to serve more students.\n\nRelocating the Big House was one of several ideas that came up during a brainstorming session, Stone said.\n\n\u201cUpon further exploration, we realized that we cannot envision a plan where we would move Wendover,\u201d Stone said.\n\n\u201cWendover and Leslie County are important to everyone connected to Frontier Nursing University as we carry the traditions of our founder Mary Breckinridge forward,\u201d she said. \u201cWe value our roots in Leslie County.\u201d\n\nStone said there has been no decision about what to do with the Hyden campus or the buildings at Wendover, but that Frontier officials understand those decisions need to be thoughtful.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that change is necessary in order to keep up with the increased demand for quality health care, grow enrollment at FNU and meet the needs of our students,\u201d Stone said. \u201cPreserving and protecting the long-term sustainability of Mary Breckinridge\u2019s legacy, including her home at Wendover, is a goal we share with the Hyden community.\u201d\n\nJoseph said she understood the reasons behind Frontier\u2019s move to Versailles.\n\nHowever, she and others are determined to hold on to the physical things that stand as a reminder of what Breckinridge created, she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to take our heritage,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "There's no way to separate trailblazing nurse-midwife Mary Breckinridge from the last 100 years of Leslie County's history, so when talk arose that the owner of her historic house might move it out of the county, people got hot.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Estep", "Lexington Herald-Leader"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/exchange-historic_home-move_27101_c0-272-3264-2175_s1770x1032.jpg?a86e043a965a9fa43be14f1a3be796517e2c3e42", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
