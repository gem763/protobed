If I didn\u2019t, I was punished\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019m going to talk about something that, until now, I have largely kept to myself. It\u2019s odd, as I consider myself a writer of extreme honesty, and I try to carry that over into real life. And yet, even now, I\u2019m hesitating, and I realise to some degree I have procrastinated even more than usual about the thinking, and writing, of this. The committing of a hidden life event to the written word. That\u2019s always a scary act.\n\nI used to wonder if my reluctance was driven by shame, or simply my incredulity at what took place all those years ago. Now, I think that it is those things mostly, but also a hell of a lot more. Over the last few years, particularly in the recent crosswinds of our racial and cultural political climate, this life event bubbled to the surface of my memory, never quite boiling over. I\u2019ve talked about it to a few of my close male friends, but that\u2019s it. I almost never mention it to women.\n\nSo, OK. I\u2019ll stop stalling and try to be as straightforward as I can.\n\nA few decades ago, when I was just becoming a published author, I was discussing projects with various companies. In one, I dealt with a white male creative, and, when he left, I was assigned to someone else, a white woman. I was overjoyed to be taken seriously at last, a bit starry-eyed from the blitz of media and publishing parties, both of which I was unused to. My new contact, charming and jovial, was full of great ideas and encouragement. We hit it off, and got to work right away.\n\nI\u2019d travel into the office several times a week, full of excitement. I was young and eager to change the world. We\u2019d sit in a room together and thrash out story outlines. Almost right away, my editor began making personal comments that I found highly unprofessional. She had black female friends, she said, who would \u201clove\u201d me. She said I was cute, and, sometimes when we were sitting at a desk side by side, she would stare into my face when we were meant to be working. It was unnerving, and, while I appreciated the compliments, which would occur every time we worked together, I began to feel a little uncomfortable in her presence.\n\nThen she suffered a small injury. There was a meeting due, and she called me up, insisting that I come to her house. Given what had been going on in the office, I wasn\u2019t that keen, so I asked if we could meet in a public place. She refused. We went back and forth until the conversation ended with her screaming down the phone, swearing at me and insisting I came to her house. I refused. The following day, someone in the company rang me up to inform me I had lost the job.\n\nI tried to fight it, but there was nothing I could do. The whole deal collapsed. I knew what had happened to me was a commonplace occurrence for women, and I\u2019d long felt outraged about that reality, but I quickly saw there was no outrage for me. When I spoke to anyone about what happened, there was a sympathetic shrug and a change of subject. So I responded the same way the majority of people would in this situation. I let it go.\n\nIt\u2019s clear to me that this incident is an example of white female privilege being used to dominate a young black man. I was perceived to have no recourse, no agency. I had to submit to being exoticised in accordance with the hypersexualised stereotype that black men are often framed by. When I refused to reciprocate, I was punished. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had seen this happen, and it wouldn\u2019t be the last opportunity I would lose because of something said about me by a white woman. My most recent loss was a university teaching post. The interventions of other students saved my professional reputation, but I lost the job anyway.\n\nMany years after, as the fallout from Harvey Weinstein\u2019s behaviour rippled and spread, and the #MeToo movement rose in its wake, I was reminded of my first experience in the media, of negative experiences involving white women from childhood to the present day and of events that happened to friends, or have occurred within the wider diasporic black community. And, although it\u2019s obvious that none of my personal experiences come anywhere close to the heinous crimes of rape and enforced sexual harassment committed globally by men, I have seen white privilege used by women as an oppressive tool far too many times to believe there should not be the same level of accountability.\n\nI\u2019ll hold my hands up and admit this is a complicated thing to tackle. I know this, and it has in part fuelled my hesitance. So, while I fully support any movement that seeks to address the rampant misogyny and patriarchy driving our society, which of course includes men of colour on too many occasions, I wonder if it\u2019s possible to have a conversation about the role white women play in the continual oppression of black men; to speak about this in a historical context, tracing the direct line from enslavement and colonisation to the present day. To have an honest discussion about the fact that white women, who obviously face a cis, white patriarchal system of oppression, also use that patriarchal system to oppress those perceived as lower on the racial and social hierarchy?\n\nI believe we must.\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not writing to generalise a whole race and gender. Many white women do not use their privilege adversely. Many are allies, instrumental in standing beside us, even speaking on subjects such as this. They exist. We see them and acknowledge their presence. That much should be obvious, although I feel it must be stated here to avoid the very real chance of being misconstrued. Still, the fact remains that black men\u2019s relationship with white women is fraught with complexity and rarely addressed, except, sometimes, as an examination into the lengths some men go to mine sexual otherness, or exoticism: black men\u2019s appreciation sex clubs almost exclusively visited by white women, mock plantation orgies, \u201cbeach boy\u201d holidays in Africa and the Caribbean. These examinations are usually from a feminine perspective. What\u2019s missing is any deep analysis of black male psychology. The mental displacement needed to attend those parties and become a \u201cbull\u201d for the night, or be paraded on the arm of a white woman in Hastings, Barbados. Is sex work less morally demeaning if a man is the sex worker and a woman the client? Why is this seen as less mentally destructive, or nuanced?\n\nWhite women have said I\u2019m not good-looking enough to be a successful writer\n\nSocial media is a slippery ally, on occasion doing as much to hinder as help the cause of social justice, but it has been exemplary at charting the numerous cases of white women caught in \u201cacts of oppression\u201d. The Memphis property manager\u2019s insistence that a black man shouldn\u2019t wear socks in a swimming pool (she called the police when he refused to leave), for instance. Or the woman who rang 911 after seeing a group of black people barbecuing in a park in Oakland, California. Or the employees who called the police on black men \u201cloitering\u201d in a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a friend. And the woman who threatened to report an eight-year-old black girl selling water in San Francisco \u2013 and even a Hispanic woman sheltering from the rain in New York.\n\nAt the same time, I have often seen social media posts where black men are accused of having very little to complain about, other than whether white women \u201clike\u201d us; if a little thing such as our likability and racism in general were cleared up, black men would declare the problem solved. It\u2019s also disappointing how often these declarations are written, and intensely felt, by black women. It seems an odd conflict; on the one hand, social media proves that contact with certain types of white women can ruin your day, if not your life. On the other lies the argument that all black men have to fear is whether we\u2019re deemed sexually viable by said women.\n\nAll I can say at this point in time, as a solo writer putting one word after another, is a feeling: intense isolation, vulnerability, the wariness that comes from needing to trust in order to continue with our lives, yet having that trust broken time and again. The fear of being in close proximity with people who may become colleagues, family, lovers, assailants, accusers, abusers or harassers. The danger of loving someone who might possibly racially abuse you in the furious heat of a domestic argument. The confusing seesaw desire of wanting to be an ally for someone\u2019s struggle while not having your struggle recognised in return.\n\nAmong my lived experiences, I have had white women punch me for getting on the bus before them, say that I\u2019m not good-looking enough to be a successful writer, rub against me on a packed tube train as if I wasn\u2019t even there, and, as I\u2019ve said above, be instrumental in my losing two jobs that I know of, possibly more that I don\u2019t. After that second incident, I was left in freefall, jobless, with a child to raise and a mortgage to pay. Being liked wasn\u2019t the issue; my survival was. Something \u2013 dumb luck or the spirits of my long-deceased grandmothers \u2013 came through for me. I prefer to believe the latter. Throughout it all, and every incident before or since, I have tried to walk as good as I can muster, and live. That\u2019s all any black man wants really, to walk in a straight line and to live. Maybe one day we will.\n\nExtracted from Safe: On Black British Men Reclaiming Space, edited by Derek Owusu, published by Orion on 7 March.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 28 February 2019.
