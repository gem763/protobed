What are they [producers] going to do?\n\nRita Simons was only allowed to take three pairs of knickers into I\u2019m A Celeb (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018I smuggled in extra knickers. You\u2019re allowed three pairs of knickers\u2026 Three pairs. I smuggled more.\u2019\n\nGiven the fact those three pairs of knickers probably get infested with various jungle bugs and critters the second a suitcase is opened, we\u2019re totally on Rita\u2019s side.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the only item the Roxy Mitchell actress took into the jungle with her.\n\n\u2018I smuggled a lighter, which got taken off me. Just in my pocket,\u2019 she said.\n\nShe also smuggled in a lighter and gum (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018Took a lighter, that got taken off of me. I took chewing gum, that got taken off of me.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t even know I had the chewing gum, they called me into the bush telegraph and said, \u201cHave you got something in your pocket?\u201d I said no\u2026\u2019\n\nKate Garraway, Richard Madeley and Love Island\u2019s Amy Hart are just some of the famous faces linked to this year\u2019s show, later this year.\n\nKate remained coy over her rumoured involvement, previously insisting she wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about it.\n\nKate Garraway has been linked to a stint on I\u2019m A Celebrity (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Even if I was doing it, I won\u2019t be able to say I\u2019m doing it. And even if I wasn\u2019t doing it, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not doing it,\u2019 she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It would be horrific. I don\u2019t like heights, I don\u2019t like the dark. I don\u2019t like camping.\n\n\u2018That is a good point actually, you can\u2019t make a mess in the jungle because it\u2019s already nature. I couldn\u2019t be tidy in the jungle.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s nothing about the show I\u2019d be good at.\n\nWell, we might have to wait and see for ourselves\u2026\n\nGood Morning Britain continues on weekdays, at 6am, on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
