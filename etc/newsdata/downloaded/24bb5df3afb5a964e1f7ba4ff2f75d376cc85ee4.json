Guardiola refused to criticise his players after the match, however, and warned his rivals that the title is a long way from over.\n\n\u201cBig congratulations for Norwich on how well they have done,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t concede too much in terms of chances, Bournemouth had more chances against us. But in the end we weren\u2019t strong enough in either box. We learn from that.\n\nTeemu Pukki strikes again to seal Norwich\u2019s shock win over Man City Read more\n\n\u201cWe knew the quality of Norwich because they destroyed the Championship last season. They have the confidence to play. In some moments we didn\u2019t play quite well. We had chances to equalise in the game but in the end congratulations to them.\u201d\n\nNorwich\u2019s third goal came about after Emi Buend\u00eda caught Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi in possession on the edge of the Manchester City box. Guardiola refused to criticise the player, though he was clear that a mistake had been made.\n\n\u201cNico doesn\u2019t really know someone is coming and nobody tells him\u201d, Guardiola said in defence of his player. \u201cSometimes you know we make mistakes. I think sometimes we forget these guys are human. Football is quick, things can go wrong and I must see what I can do to help them.\n\n\u201cFive points [behind Liverpool] is five points but we are in September. What are we supposed to do? Say: \u2018It\u2019s September and congratulations to Liverpool you are champions\u2019? Not for one second am I going to doubt my players.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City\u2019s manager, Pep Guardiola, refused to criticise his players after their 3-2 defeat by Norwich, saying that \u2018sometimes we forget they are human\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Macinnes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c9667a0cc25430c55990aa59edc941c51cf0a3f/0_46_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25ecf67c8120dbec87f1e28d7333020a", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
