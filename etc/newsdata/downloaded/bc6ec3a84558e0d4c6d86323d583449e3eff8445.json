Players begin by choosing a gender, one of the creator\u2019s simplest options. From there, they can choose between 32 different premade characters. These serve as a starting point for a much larger series of decisions. Each preset character is stunning in their own way.\n\nOnce a preset is selected, the best option is to skip down to entering a name and advancing directly to gameplay. Otherwise, moving on to \u201cAdvanced Settings\u201d opens up a staggering amount of customisation that kept me occupied for several hours when I was supposed to be playing the actual game.\n\nThere are 58 different hairstyles in Code Vein\u2019s character creator. Each hairstyle has multiple colour options, base colour, and highlights. Once you\u2019ve chosen and coloured the perfect hairstyle you\u2019ll discover the accessories menu. Along with glasses, hats, gloves, jewellery, and other random bits, the accessories menu has an entire section filled with hair extensions.\n\nThere are only a handful of outfits in Code Vein\u2019s character creator, which is good, because each one can be customised with dozens of different colours and patterns. Flat colours. Glowing colours. Plaids. Animal patterns. Metallic sheens. Vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, and checkerboard.\n\nSweet Christ, there are 66 different options for eye highlights in Code Vein\u2019s character creator. EYE HIGHLIGHTS.\n\nThis is why I spent an hour and a half creating my first character in Code Vein. Then I played through the opening section and realised I didn\u2019t like the character I created. I made a new character and started the game over. Eventually, I found the in-game headquarters, where characters can be edited on the fly. I felt stupid for not checking this out sooner, but also pretty.\n\nI spent ten minutes showing off Code Vein\u2019s character creator while gushing. It\u2019s deep and complicated, as a character creator should be. It\u2019s the game\u2019s best feature.", "description": "There are nearly 500 eyebrow options in Code Vein\u2019s character creator.", "authors": ["Alex Walker", "Zack Zwiezen"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/mjaaoqlifdh36lmcworu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
