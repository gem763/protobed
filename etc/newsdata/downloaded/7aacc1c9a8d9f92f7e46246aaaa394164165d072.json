There's no denying that while almost everyone watches it, there are few who admit to it, particularly to their partners. So why is it that porn is a forbidden subject for couples? According to Gouri Srivastava, a counsellor at a women\u2019s college in Chennai, \u201cMen and women perceive and use porn differently, with men being six times more likely to consume it than women. While for men, porn seems like a harmless stimulus, most women view it as infidelity, since it involves gratification from an external source, not from the relationship itself.\u201d But is the mere practice of watching porn wrong? We break down the facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEN\n\nThe pros:\n\nIt is a stress buster\n\nIt has been scientifically proven that engaging in any form of sexual activity, be it with a partner or oneself\u2014increases the production of dopamine, or the brain chemical that is a mood enhancer. Men who consume porn in healthy quantities for sexual stimulus, find themselves relatively stress-free as the process of ejaculating lowers stress hormones. While porn might be a great way to de-stress, a 2013 Carnegie Mellon study concluded that even looking at photos of \u2018sexy\u2019 and beautiful women had the same impact. Matthew Phillip*, a 31-year-old music teacher based in Bangalore says that attractive visuals, whether they\u2019re of food or of scenic locations, do make one feel happy and satisfied. \"Similarly, photos of desirable women, which are clearly meant to titillate, do uplift my mood and help defuse stress. I often end up viewing these images online to unwind and release pent-up hormones,\u201d he shares.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpices up your sex life\n\nWatching porn is an easy way to discover what turns you on and what doesn\u2019t. It also helps you go that extra mile with your partner wherein you take cues from what you see to spice up your sex lives. \u201cI wanted to discover what makes us tick in the bedroom, so rather than trying it firsthand with each other and getting it wrong, we watched some porn together and figured out what kinks turned us on and what our common fantasies were,\u201d reveals Phillip.\n\nThe cons:\n\nErectile dysfunction\n\nAlthough there are contradictory views on the matter, porn-induced erectile dysfunction is a down side to its heavy consumption. Dr Jennifer Johnson, a professor in the department of sociology of the College of Humanities and Sciences at the Virginia Commonwealth University, USA, shared with a portal, \u201cAmong college-aged heterosexual men, 51 per cent masturbated to pornography several times a week, 19 per cent use it several times a month and 13.5 per cent use it daily.\u201d This suggests that fantasy can be more stimulating than reality, resulting in a decreased libido. \u201cWith such staggering numbers of men being aroused on a regular basis, it is no wonder then, that erectile dysfunction could be a byproduct of this syndrome,\u201d says Srivastava. She add that people who take regular doses of antibiotics or painkillers build up resistance towards them, similarly, frequent arousal due to regularly watching porn could also cause erectile dysfunction.\n\n\n\n\n\nAggression\n\n\u201cWhile the ethical porn movement is slowly underway, there is no denying that pornography may have men viewing women in a sexually derogatory manner. This often veers on the dark and violent side if men are not able to keep it in check, and could take its toll on your sex life, if you\u2019re not able to detach from the negative portrayal of women in porn,\u201d opines Srivastava. In fact, she counselled a young girl who suffered bruises on her wrists in the recent past. Her partner was turned on by a bondage-themed porn video, and coerced her to recreate that fantasy. In the bargain, he ended up tying her wrists too tight, and hurting her. She broke up with him, but the experience has left both of them scarred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWOMEN\n\nThe pros\n\nHelps express sexuality\n\nWatching porn can work wonders for women in several ways. Not only is it liberating and a means of accessible release (as is the case with men as well), it also has an impact on their sex drive. \u201cWhen a woman watches pornography, it increases her libido and could prove useful for women with a low sex drive,\u201d says Dr Jagannathan. Maya Hari, a 29-year-old freelance journalist and writer from Chennai shares, \u201cOnce you get past the initial squeamishness (if you\u2019re hesitant or unused to it), watching porn and reading erotica definitely has a positive impact on your sex drive. Not only has it given me a little extra confidence in the bedroom with my husband, I also feel more aware of what is possible, I know what turns me on, and I feel like it has really bolstered my ability to be a little adventurous in bed!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFosters a stronger bond\n\nIf you are looking at strengthening your relationship with your partner in bed, watching adult content together could prove to be a good move in the direction. Srivastava believes that watching porn with your partner keeps lines of communication open, and fosters an honest relationship. \u201cMen usually develop feelings of shame or guilt while watching porn, because the general attitude is for women to make them feel that they\u2019ve crossed\n\na line of morality. However, porn viewing can be an exercise in togetherness, and can help bring the couple closer sexually, physically, and emotionally, because they feel stronger once they have shared their deepest, innermost sexual fantasies without judgment,\u201d says Dr Jagannathan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cons\n\nBody image\n\nLet\u2019s face it, most adult film/show stars have perfect bodies, perfect faces, and can perform feats in the bedroom that put acrobats to shame. However, it\u2019s best not to compare, but use the viewing experience to enhance your sex life. According to Srivastava, \u201cWhen women compare themselves to porn stars, they tend to feel incompetent. Remember, there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re porn stars. If you and your partner are sexually attracted to each other, porn is just a stimulant to help you spice things up between the sheets, rather than a benchmark of what you think your partner expects from you.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAddiction\n\nInternet porn can be extremely addictive, as a recent statistics by Pornhub have revealed. Last year, India ranked third in the consumption of free porn, following the USA and UK. The average age of the porn consumer is 29, with 30 per cent consumption coming from women. Says Dr Jagannathan, \u201cNot everyone who watches pornography is addicted. It only becomes a problem when the person needs porn on a day-to-day basis, and begins to have withdrawal symptoms when it is taken away from him or her. It becomes an obsession, and rather than watching porn whenever they find the time and opportunity, they start obsessively creating time and opportunity for it\u2014even avoiding outings and regular activities in the bargain. When this starts happening, it is a sign of addictive behaviour, and it needs to be addressed with the help of a professional counsellor.\u201d\n\n\n\nPorn for Women\n\nIn a pleasant turn of events, feminist porn, created largely for the viewing pleasure of women, has been catching up. Dr Santanam Jagannathan, a Chennai-based sexologist, says, \u201cContrary to popular belief, porn preferred by women does not only involve images or videos of hot men. Women find other women sexually stimulating because it reminds them of the sexual pleasure they can feel themselves. This includes a lot of self-help and masturbation videos, with sex toys being part of the plot too. Women tend to be more imaginative, so role play, theme-based videos, and so on, are fairly popular.\"", "description": "Porn continues to be a taboo topic in most relationships, with men and women employing different views.
