Those lies are the promises the adamant Democrats and some ambivalent Republicans have made to us voters. They will not get our votes again.\n\nThe impeachment-happy politicians have also collocated words to provide natural-sounding language pleasing to the needs of the moment, and for the duplicitous situations they have created. Ironically, they have undertaken this impeachment effort with hatred, not true political crimes, as the purpose. The ineffective Democrats have created a government in their own images and likeness because fear owns them.\n\nThose with criminal tendencies and the new harpies who make their home in the swamp of Capitol Hill do so precariously. Their insanity is now on full, unbiased display in the light of the \u201cCity Upon on the Hill.\u201d The light of that hill is the beacon we must always follow.\n\nMany of us have drained our own personal swamps and know how difficult it is. We salute you, Mr. Trump, and the work of your presidency.
