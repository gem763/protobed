LSCC, +1.27% gained 53 cents to $19.73 on 1.8 million shares traded Thursday. The move, on no news from the company and following through on Wednesday\u2019s rally, positioned the stock at the top of its five-week sideways channel. A break through this top near the intraday high at $20.42 could accelerate the stock toward $26.\n\nSonos Inc. SONO, -2.68% rose 19 cents to $14.90 on 3.2 million shares traded Thursday, 2 1/2 times its average volume, after gaining 4% on Wednesday. The speaker maker unveiled a new home speaker that doesn\u2019t have an internal microphone, thus addressing privacy concerns. The stock is in a steep rising channel off its August low below $10, with next targets at $16 and then $18.\n\nTwitter Inc. TWTR, +0.26% popped $1.94, or 4.4%, to $45.30 on 19.3 million shares traded Thursday. The move, on nearly 1 1/2 times its average volume, broke the stock out of a month-long, high-level consolidation. Watch for a move to the channel top near $47.50-$48.\n\nInMode Ltd. INMD, -9.66%, our lone non-technology stock, continued higher Thursday, up $1.45 to $26.72 on strong volume of 1.7 million shares traded. The stock is up from last week\u2019s close at $19.90 on bullish coverage initiation of the medical-device company by several Wall Street firms. The move has broken the stock out of a two-week flag that followed its post-IPO pop. The rising channel top points to $31-$32. Watch support at Thursday\u2019s low near $25.50.\n\nSee Harry\u2019s video-chart analysis on these stocks.\n\nThe writer has no holdings in any securities mentioned.\n\nHarry Boxer is founder of TheTechTrader.com, a live trading room featuring his stock picks, technical market analysis and live chart presentations.", "description": "Also: Lattice Semiconductor and Sonos.", "authors": ["Harry Boxer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM657_Twitte_ZG_20190702172302.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
