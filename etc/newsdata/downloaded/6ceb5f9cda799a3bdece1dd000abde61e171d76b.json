What EOS was lacking was a stablecoin that could help these projects manage exposure to price volatility.\u201d\n\nNext stop \u2014 mainnet launch\n\nPer the announcement, EOSIO\u2019s peer-to-peer micropayment infrastructure currently powers 49% of the top 100 decentralized applications (DApps) and seven of the top 10 DApps with the highest 24 hour transaction activity.\n\nSteven Quinn, EOSFinex product lead, noted that now the platform\u2019s next goal is to \u201cwork with others in the EOS community to bring block irreversibility times down to 3 seconds\u201d and fully launch EOSFinex on the mainnet.\n\nEOS network can freeze?\n\nAt the same time, as Cointelegraph reported on Oct. 4, EOS blockchain protocol users have been experiencing periodic problems with network access within the past few weeks.\n\nA recent article written by pseudonymous smart contract developer and security engineer Dexaran described the apparent root of the problem: an inexpensive technique that allows hackers to \u201ccongest\u201d the network \u2014 or put it into a low-efficiency mode \u2014 with just a few dollars worth of EOS.\n\nSeemingly, that exploit allowed a hacker to steal more than $110,000 in cryptocurrency from an EOS gambling application EOSPlay earlier in September. However, executives of EOS\u2019s parent firm Block.one are not fazed, arguing that the network is operating \u201ccorrectly.\u201d\n\nRecently, stablecoin firm Tether and its affiliate exchange Bitfinex have stated that they anticipate a lawsuit alleging that USDT token is involved in market manipulation as the result of yet unpublished research.", "description": "Cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex and EOSFinex announce that they successfully \u201cchainswapped\u201d 5 million USDT onto the EOS protocol", "authors": ["Liam Frost"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvNzVmOWY2ZjMyYWIzZTBmYjhjM2Y0OTI4NmIwNzYzNTguanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
