Vance inadvertently propelled that belief nationwide with his 2016 bestseller, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nI tore through the book. I liked it. I respect the way Vance built his career and his efforts to bring venture capital back home. But a side effect of his book sales did a disservice to the great state of Ohio.\n\nWhat he describes is not the state I know, and it\u2019s not the way I grew up.\n\nThis book cover image released by HarperCollins Publishers shows \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis,\" by J.D. Vance. (Photo: AP)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the problems Vance encountered don\u2019t exist. We desperately need to find ways to combat the opioid epidemic and close the skills gap.\n\nFortunately, Ohio has the tools and resources to do both of those things, and those assets are what make the state a vibrant, dynamic one that America should view as a destination and example for so many others. It\u2019s an economic powerhouse Democrats would be foolish to concede without a robust campaign, though rumors abound in Washington, D.C., that the party doesn\u2019t plan to compete here in 2020.\n\nOhio isn't all \"Hillbilly Elegy\"\n\nWhat it may need now is a marketing campaign to change the ingrained impression Vance wrought.\n\nHere\u2019s a start: According to Boss Magazine, Ohio is the fifth-ranking state in the nation for the number of Fortune 500 headquarters with 25, behind the standard behemoths of New York, Texas, California and our midwestern neighbor, Illinois. Those Ohio companies generate $644.5 million in annual revenue, and that\u2019s a full $240 million more per year than the next state on the list, New Jersey.\n\nThe hardest column I ever had to write: I went back home to Ohio's Trump country. In Appalachia, honest people have hope again.\n\nColumbus ranks near the top on all kinds of city lists for entrepreneurial growth and startup hiring and sustainability \u2014 and it has since at least 2016, before Vance jumped into venture funding.\n\nAuthor and venture capitalist J.D.

The medical schools at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio State University and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland are all ranked in the top 40 by U.S. News and World Report. Outside of Ohio, people know of the Cleveland Clinic, but in my anecdotal experience, they are entirely unaware of the sprawling Health-Tech Corridor surrounding it that has become a world-class destination for the medical community.\n\nYou\u2019d think we\u2019d be able to do something about the health care industry and opioids.\n\nDeclaring war on rural America: Democrats want to close churches, raise taxes and pay for sex reassignment surgery. Great.\n\nAnd every time the New York Times comes to town, they leave slack-jawed over the revelation that Cincinnati is an artsy city. When should we tell them it\u2019s exceptionally musical, too? (How often I tell my East Coast friends about Music Hall, the Aronoff Center, Playhouse in the Park, the College-Conservatory of Music, that the Cincinnati Symphony is a feeder for the Boston Pops, May Festival Chorus. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the emerging music scene.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigns in Orlando, Florida, on June 18, 2019.

They scoff.\n\nWhy would Democrats cede any of this economic clout and creative energy to the Republican Party?\n\nErin McPike is a Cincinnati native and former political reporter for CNN, NBC News, National Journal and RealClearPolitics.
