This image, published in The View yearbook, was obtained by Time\n\nThe Liberal Party leader\u2019s campaign has been upended since Time magazine on Wednesday published an image of the prime minister, who is known to be strong advocate for multiculturalism, with his face blackened at a 2001 \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party when he was a 29-year-old teacher at a Vancouver private school.\n\nOther images have since emerged, and Trudeau said he was \u201cwary\u201d of ruling out the existence of even more because he could not remember those that had already come to light.\n\nAnswering questions from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Trudeau said that his privilege as the white son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau had come with a \u201cblind spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from a place of privilege and I have endeavored in my life to put the advantages and opportunities I\u2019ve been given to serve this country, to fight for people\u2019s rights,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve let a lot of people down ... and I stand here today to reflect on that and to ask forgiveness.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Trudeau held a conference call for all his 338 candidates in the election for Canada\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cHe said this is the moment for us to continue to work together to understand the pain of people who are on the receiving end of racism and stereotypes,\u201d one Liberal on the call said.\n\nEven before the scandal, the race going into the Oct. 21 vote was tight. But the release of the bombshell images could be a turning point, in part because Liberals have traditionally attracted support from immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cIt is clearly very damaging at this time, and the full impacts will not become clear for a week or so,\u201d said Frank Graves, head of the EKOS Research polling company. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will be fatal, but time will tell.\u201d\n\nTrudeau has championed racial equality and diversity as prime minister, and has three prominent ministers of Indian descent in his Cabinet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m someone who understands the deep hurt cause by actions like that to people who live with discrimination every single day.\u201d\n\nGreg Fergus, a black Liberal legislator from Quebec, said Trudeau had called him before the story broke on Wednesday to apologize.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that anybody has ever lived their lives without making errors,\u201d Fergus told reporters in Ottawa, saying Canadians should focus on \u201call the amazing things we have done for diversity.\u201d\n\n\u2018DAY-O\u2019\n\nOn Wednesday, Trudeau also admitted to performing \u201cDay-O\u201d, a traditional Jamaican song made famous by Harry Belafonte in the 1950s, in blackface during a high school talent show years earlier. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp then published a picture from the performance that a Liberal spokeswoman confirmed as authentic.\n\nGlobal News put out a video showing Trudeau again in dark makeup making faces and sticking his tongue out. It was not immediately clear exactly when that video was from.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that it is him and it\u2019s from the early 1990s,\u201d a Liberal official said.\n\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer, Trudeau\u2019s main rival, said the video was proof that the prime minister had lied during his apology on Wednesday because he only mentioned having appeared in blackface twice.\n\n\u201cHe did something that was racist and he lied about the extent of such activities,\u201d Scheer told reporters in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec. But Scheer also acknowledged that the Conservatives had leaked the video to Global News.\n\nTrudeau has seen his once sky-high popularity hurt by a series of missteps, including a ruling last month by a top watchdog that he had breached ethics rules by pressuring the former justice minister to ensure a major construction firm avoid a corruption trial.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau vowed to continue his re-election campaign and asked for forgiveness on Thursday after pictures of him in blackface emerged less than five weeks before the national vote.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431744299&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I1YY-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
