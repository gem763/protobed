The pedestrian, a 30-year-old man, died shortly afterwards.\n\n'The shock!,' Harit later recalled to French newspaper L'Equipe. 'I stopped 100 to 150 metres from the accident because I could hardly realise it.\n\n'I waited for the police, I was in shock. It was the worst moment of my life.'\n\nAs Harit was taken into custody and had his passport confiscated, every aspect of his life and football career was up in the air. Would he be allowed back to Germany? Would he even be a free man?\n\nIn the end, Harit was sentenced to a four-month suspended sentence and a fine of 8,600 dirhams (equivalent to \u00a3700). There was an out-of-court cash settlement with the victim's family.\n\nFollowing the trauma of being involved in a fatal car crash, Harit has returned to top form\n\nThe Moroccan has reprised his role as Schalke's X-factor during a great start to the season\n\nSchalke sit sixth in a congested upper half of the Bundesliga after seven rounds of games\n\nHis passport was returned a week after the crash so he could return for pre-season training with Schalke.\n\nBut the shock of the accident and guilt at causing the death weighed heavily on the 21-year-old.\n\nHaving been named the 'Bundesliga Rookie of the Year' in 2017-18, the following season was something of a disaster.\n\nHarit suffered with injury problems, disciplinary issues and inconsistent form, at one stage being withdrawn completely from the Schalke first-team squad.\n\nThere were also reports Harit asked a Duisburg casino where he'd been spending too many late nights to ban him for his own good.\n\nHis slump was one contributory factor in a nightmare campaign for a club that usually compete in the upper reaches of the Bundesliga.\n\nFrom a second place finish in 2017-18, they flirted with relegation before eventually coming 14th after manager Domenico Todesco was sacked in mid-March and interim Huub Stevens dragged them over the safety line.\n\nHarit struggled for form and fitness last season as he struggled following the car accident - but he has excelled again this season with four goals and two assist in the Bundesliga\n\nFormer Huddersfield manager David Wagner has transformed Schalke's fortunes this season\n\nHarit gets a cuddle from Wagner after scoring during the win at Paderborn in September\n\nSchalke this season August 17 Borussia Monchengladbach (A) 0-0 August 24 Bayern Munich (H) 0-3 August 31 Hertha Berlin (H) 3-0 September 15 Paderborn (A) 5-1 September 20 Mainz (H) 2-1 September 28 RB Leipzig (A) 3-1 October 5 Cologne (H) 1-1\n\n'When I was on the pitch, I told myself that I would not succeed. It just didn't feel right in my deepest core,' Harit admitted when reflecting on a troubled season.\n\nBy the start of this season, Schalke fans had almost forgotten the X-factor Harit had brought to their team. Fortunately, he has wasted little time in reminding them.\n\nDavid Wagner, the former Huddersfield Town coach, came in and proved a breath of fresh air at the Veltins-Arena.\n\nAs we enter the October international break, Schalke sit sixth in the table but are just two points off the top in a densely-packed top eight.\n\nThey have won four of their last five matches, with a rejuvenated Harit demonstrating his class with four goals and two assists in that time.\n\nIn the 5-1 win over Paderborn, he produced a deft feint and clinical left-footed finish that was followed by a well-placed bottom corner strike with his stronger right.\n\nAt home to Mainz, Harit took the game by the scruff of the net before winning it in the final minute with a classy outside-of-the-boot strike from just outside the box.\n\nAnd in the eye-catching 3-1 win at RB Leipzig, he won and converted a penalty before slipping through the Welsh winger Rabbi Matondo for the contest-settling third.\n\nHarit fires home during Schalke's 5-1 victory over Paderborn in the Bundesliga last month\n\nHarit scores a classy outside-of-the-boot goal to seal Schalke's late victory over Mainz\n\nAnd he was spot on from 12 yards as Schalke secured a 3-1 victory at high-fliers RB Leipzig\n\nWagner has managed to not only restore Harit's confidence following so many difficulties, but has the Moroccan taking personal command of games to gain positive results.\n\n'I feel great confidence from the coach and can now pay it back,' Harit said after the win over Paderborn. 'I work hard, I'm free in the head again and play football, so I want to continue.'\n\nHarit also became father to a baby girl back in May, another factor he credits for his return to top form.\n\n'When I found out I was going to be a father, I clicked. In football, you can fool around, but with a child, you don't have the right to make mistakes. I understand I have to change.' he said.\n\nThe way Schalke are playing, there's no reason why they can't finish in the Bundesliga's top four this season. Harit just seems to be getting started.", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD: Amine Harit's world was turned upside down when he hit a pedestrian shortly after the World Cup in 2018.
