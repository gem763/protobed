Neither they nor their parents would press charges.\n\nOfficer Garrett Ware handled both investigations and closed the second case Sept. 20. Students viewed the activity as \u201chorseplay\u201d and some alleged victims had jokingly reciprocated.\n\n\u201cAll parties involved indicated that, although highly inappropriate and potentially criminal, the behavior was done without malicious or criminal intent or sexual motivation,\u201d Ware wrote.\n\nThe Northshore School District afterward imposed unspecified student discipline and school sanctions, including potential cancellation of some overnight playoff road trips, spokeswoman Lisa Youngblood Hall said in a statement.\n\nSchool administrators and football coach Tom Bainter made plans for increased supervision, she said, after the April investigation to \u201censure a safe environment\u201d for players.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Seattle Times, http://www.seattletimes.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Police in Bothell declined to forward charges against Bothell High School football players after concluding that inappropriate behavior was horseplay rather than criminal behavior.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
