Yankees, take your shot.", "language": "en", "text": "The significance of that date is now clear as Cole and the Houston Astros prepare for Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium: Although he has taken the mound 24 more times and thrown more than 160 additional innings, regular and postseason combined, that start against the White Sox remains the last time Cole was beaten.\n\nThose facts \u2014 as well as Cole\u2019s 18-0 record and 1.66 ERA in the nearly five months since, a stretch that includes two dominant victories over the Tampa Bay Rays in the AL Division Series \u2014 strain the limits of credibility and history. Nobody wins 18 straight decisions in baseball in the same season, or at least nobody in more than a century, since Rube Marquard won 19 in a row for the 1912 New York Giants. Between May 23 and the end of the season, by contrast, Reynaldo L\u00f3pez of the White Sox lost 11 times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is good to be the Astros right now, with the 6-foot-4 Cole, a 29-year-old right-hander, taking the mound in a series tied at one game apiece \u2014 and presumably on track to start a potential Game 7 at Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park five days later.\n\n\u201cWe know he\u2019s going to come out hot. We know he\u2019s going to get his strikeouts. We know he\u2019s going to set a tone \u2014 he\u2019s intense,\u201d Astros Manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cThere\u2019s no mistaking him in what his priority is, which is to get deep in the game and give us a chance to win. And he\u2019s done that as much as anybody in baseball.\u201d\n\nIt is also good to be Gerrit Cole, in the prime of your career, with a full arsenal of some of the most dastardly pitches in the game, and a free agent payday the likes of which the game may have never seen awaiting this winter. He is almost certain to become just the fifth pitcher to get a contract worth more than $200 million, and he could exceed David Price\u2019s $217 million deal to become the highest-paid pitcher in history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCole\u2019s dominance this season, his seventh in the majors, is difficult to overstate. His 13.82 strikeouts per nine innings is a record for qualified starters. His 326 strikeouts were the most since Randy Johnson in 2002. After July 12, the Astros never lost with him on the mound, going 13-0. In his first start against the Rays in the division series, he struck out 15 in 7\u2154 innings and induced 33 swinging strikes, the most in a postseason game since pitch-level data became available.\n\n\u201cIt looked like he aged out. Like, check his birth certificate. He looked like the kid pitching in Little League [who\u2019s] too good for the league,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone joked of Cole\u2019s performance against the Rays. \u201cIt\u2019s hard [to face], but it\u2019s also really fun.\u201d\n\nAsked how he managed to hit 100 mph on the radar gun with his 116th pitch of Game 2 against Tampa Bay, Cole answered matter-of-factly, \u201cGod.\u201d When the gathered media chuckled, he added that, no, he was serious: It comes from a place beyond his human capacity. \u201cI just try not to mess it up,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCole\u2019s fastball, with its \u201clate life\u201d or \u201crise\u201d or \u201chop\u201d \u2014 descriptors for the effect of its backspin, which makes the pitch appear to elevate as it nears the plate \u2014 may be the most devastating pitch in baseball. By pitch-values rankings on FanGraphs, it led the majors in runs saved with 36.2. The second-best was teammate Justin Verlander\u2019s slider at 33.4. This winter, Cole and Verlander are expected to finish 1-2, in whichever order, for the AL Cy Young Award.\n\nCole\u2019s slider, change-up and curveball are similarly deadly, and as the Yankees well know, he can throw them all for strikes.\n\n\u201cSlider, curveball, change-up, heater \u2014 he always gets that first strike, either swinging or he\u2019ll put one over the plate,\u201d Yankees slugger Aaron Judge said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really love watching about Cole, especially \u2014 just how he\u2019s able to go out and work the edges well with all his pitches and just getting that strike one. That\u2019s huge, especially in the postseason.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn his two starts against the Rays, he held their hitters to a .118/.167/.196 slash line (batting average/on-base/slugging), effectively turning every batter he faced into a pitcher at the plate (.128/.159/.163 in 2019, collectively). But the Yankees\u2019 offense should be a vastly tougher test than that of the Rays; the Yankees led the majors in runs (943) and finished second to the Minnesota Twins with 306 homers.\n\nShould the Yankees ultimately see their season unravel at Cole\u2019s hands \u2014 they could still win the series without beating him, by taking Games 4, 5 and 6, but the margin for error is nil \u2014 it would be a doubly painful fall because they had two prime chances to acquire him but failed both times.\n\nThe first was in 2008, when Cole was coming out of Orange (Calif.) Lutheran High and the Yankees drafted him 28th overall, only to see him honor his commitment to UCLA. Three years later, the Pittsburgh Pirates made him the No. 1 pick of the 2011 draft, signing him for $8 million. Then, in January 2018, the Yankees were in hot pursuit of Cole, whom the Pirates were trying to trade, only to see their offer lose out to that of the Astros \u2014 a development that still irks some in the Yankees organization who feel their offer was better.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCole\u2019s arrival in Houston that winter came at a low point for the pitcher \u2014 his signature two-seam fastball was getting crushed, leaving him with a career-worst 4.26 ERA in 2017, giving him the look of a classic victim of the launch-angle revolution that arose largely as a response to the predominance of sinkers like Cole\u2019s. But it came at a high point for the Astros, who had just won the franchise\u2019s first World Series and were gaining a reputation for fixing wayward pitchers with an approach that relied heavily on data \u2014 helping maximize spin rates, for example \u2014 and common sense. The message essentially was: Throw your best pitches more, and your worst pitches less, or not at all.\n\nFor Cole, that mostly meant ditching the two-seamer \u2014 which he threw 18.1 percent of the time in 2017, his final season in Pittsburgh, but less than 1 percent in 2019 with the Astros \u2014 in favor of the harder, higher four-seamer, and kicking up the velocity on his curve. Like many pitchers the Astros acquire, Cole has also displayed a significant increase in his spin rates, with his four-seamer, according to Statcast data, going from 2,163 rpm (with a swing-and-miss rate of 19.8 percent) in 2017 to 2,530 rpm (and a 37.6 percent swing-and-miss rate) in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe key principle was using a lot of the data to discern, like, what is your strength,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they were reinventing the wheel \u2014 they were just showing me what I did well and then allowed me just to attack.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHaving let Cole slip away twice already, the Yankees could have a third chance this winter, when he hits free agency for the first time. The Astros have made little effort so far to re-sign him, with owner Jim Crane acknowledging the luxury-tax threshold is an impediment and telling the Houston Chronicle: \u201cWe may make a run at it. We\u2019re not sure yet.\u201d\n\nThe extension the Astros gave to Verlander in the spring, as well as the July trade for Zack Greinke, were widely viewed as hedges on the potential loss of Cole this winter.\n\nBut the Yankees would have competition for Cole, whose potential availability on the open market would undoubtedly lead to a feeding frenzy that could push prices into uncharted territory for pitchers. The largest contract the Yankees have given a pitcher is their seven-year, $155 million deal with Masahiro Tanaka in 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHaving failed so far to acquire Cole, the most dominant pitcher on the planet at this moment, the Yankees\u2019 best hope may be to beat him. But they may also find the former to be far easier \u2014 all that would take is money.\n\nRead more on the MLB playoffs :\n\nAD", "description": "The big right-hander, a front-runner for the AL Cy Young Award, has put together a run of dominance that hasn\u2019t been seen in more than a century.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9rp-aj77VVOslx4Q2WzOWD6Wy9k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SGVDG2HOZMI6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
