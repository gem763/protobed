EU foreign ministers are also set to discuss Turkey and Syria at a meeting on Monday.\n\nSweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde, meanwhile, announced she would propose implementing a European arms embargo against Turkey at Monday's foreign ministers' meeting, a move backed by the Swedish parliament on Friday. The incursion \"violates international law,\" she said.\n\nOn Thursday, Norway and Finland suspended weapons exports to Ankara. (Norway, like Turkey, is a member of NATO.)\n\nTurkey hopes to push Syrian Kurdish forces away from the Turkish-Syrian border. It considers the People's Protection Units (YPG) \u2014 a Syrian Kurdish militia that played a key role in the defeat of the Islamic State and which controls large swaths of northeastern Syria \u2014 a terrorist group.\n\nAnkara also plans to establish a so-called \"safe zone\" in the areas it takes from the YPG to resettle refugees in Syria. Turkey hosts approximately 3.5 million Syrians, according to official figures.\n\nFollowing fierce criticism of the incursion from EU countries, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan on Thursday warned he would \"open the gates\" and send millions of refugees \"your way\" if European leaders labeled the offensive an \"occupation.\" (Erdo\u011fan has issued this threat numerous times since the EU signed a migration agreement with Turkey in 2016.)\n\nTurkey said on Friday morning that its operation has so far killed 277 militants. One Turkish soldier also died. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed militia alliance dominated by the YPG, said several civilians had been killed.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee warned this week that Ankara's offensive could displace as many as 300,000 people and disrupt humanitarian relief efforts in Syria.", "description": "Sweden hopes to push for an EU weapons embargo in response to Ankara\u2019s Syria incursion.", "authors": ["Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175319743-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
