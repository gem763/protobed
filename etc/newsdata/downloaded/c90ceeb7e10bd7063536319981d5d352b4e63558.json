Beginning January 1, 2020, the FAA has mandated that aircraft operating in airspace defined by 14 CFR \u00a7 91.225 must be equipped with an ADS-B Out system that meets the minimum performance requirements of 14 CFR \u00a7 91.227. The FAA previously approved AerTrak for Boeing 737 Classic and NG series aircraft (ST04009NY) and Boeing 757-200 series aircraft (ST04011NY).\n\nADS-B provides enhanced navigational accuracy using precise tracking via global positioning satellite (GPS) signals. Reducing risk and improving safety, the technology increases navigational coverage, especially in remote areas beyond radar range. Additionally, ADS-B enables more direct flight plans, thereby saving time, costs, and reducing emissions.\n\n\u201cAerTrak is the innovative Engineered Solution\u2122 we developed to help our customers cost-effectively and quickly achieve compliance with the ADS-B Operations rule,\u201d said Nicolas Finazzo, Executive Chairman of AerSale. \u201cAerSale proactively creates these unique technically advanced Engineered Solutions to satisfy new regulatory mandates well before compliance deadlines are reached.\u201d\n\n\u201cOperators of Boeing 777-200 series aircraft now join the ranks of those operating Boeing 737 Classic, 737 NG, and 757-200 series aircraft with an easy path to ADS-B Out compliance prior to the rapidly approaching deadline,\u201d said Iso Nezaj, Chief Technical Officer of AerSale. \u201cIn addition to offering significant cost savings, AerTrak can be used with any OEM transponder/MMR combination and seamlessly integrates with most existing avionics and cockpit controls, making it an especially attractive solution.\u201d\n\nAerTrak kits include all necessary parts and can be installed by AerSale\u2019s technicians at any hangar worldwide. Lead time for ordering AerTrak is currently four weeks and allows operators to avoid potential installation facility backlogs, component shortages, and price premiums as the 2020 compliance deadline nears.\n\nAerSale\u2019s innovative Engineered Solutions such as AerTrak include in-house alternative repairs and modifications designed to lower replacement part costs and provide cost-saving means of complying with regulatory mandates and recommendations. These Engineered Solutions reduce downtime, decrease capital investment required for aircraft upgrades, and extend aircraft service life.\n\nAbout AerSale\n\nA global aviation leader, AerSale is an aftermarket provider of used commercial aircraft, engines, and components, in addition to offering a broad range of MRO and engineering services for commercial and governmental aircraft and components.
