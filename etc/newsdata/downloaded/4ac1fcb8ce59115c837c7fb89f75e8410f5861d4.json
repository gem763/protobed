The Roadrunners scored after converting on fourth-and-eight at the Black Knights\u2019 33-yard line.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArmy: The Black Knights continue to thrive under Monken. Army has won three straight bowl games and closed last season with 13 straight victories. The offense continues to dazzle but the defense is limiting opponents to 281 yards per game this season.\n\nUTSA: Frank Wilson is off to another slow start in his fourth season in charge of the Roadrunners. UTSA is 1-2 despite returning 15 starters from last season\u2019s team that opened 0-3. The Roadrunners started 0-3 in 2016 and qualified for the New Mexico Bowl but are 5-12 over the past three seasons. Wilson has one year remaining on a five-year contract he signed prior to the 2016 season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArmy: Welcomes Morgan State to Michie Stadium next Saturday. The Black Knights throttled the Bears 60-3 in their previous matchup, Nov. 19, 2016, at West Point, N.Y.\n\nUTSA: Opens Conference USA by traveling to North Texas Saturday. The Roadrunners are 3-3 against the Mean Green but have lost two straight, including a 24-21 loss Nov. 24, 2018, at the Alamodome.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Army bounced back from an emotional loss to roll past Texas-San Antonio 31-13 Saturday at the Alamodome.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/army_west_point_utsa_football_43687_c0-306-5881-3734_s1770x1032.jpg?e072458931a854be3c70e4b99ceac6dd54426182", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
