The meeting began with a handshake but no smiles.\n\nAbe urged Seoul to keep its promises - a reference to the 1965 treaty - in order to restore relations, according to statement issued by Japan's foreign ministry.\n\nHe also repeated Tokyo's stance that the South Korean court ruling fundamentally overturned the basis of bilateral ties, a Japanese government spokesman told a briefing after the talks.\n\n\"Our two nations are important neighbours for each other, and keeping in contact over North Korea, bilateral relations and our ties with the United States are quite important,\" Abe was quoted as telling Lee.\n\n\"Relations are currently in quite a severe state but should not be left that way. If South Korea can keep bilateral promises, that could be a chance to return to a healthy relationship,\" Abe added.\n\nThe statement also quoted Lee as saying he shared the view that dialogue was important, while a parallel statement from South Korea's foreign ministry said Lee agreed relations should not be left in their current difficult state.\n\nIn a sign that gaps remain wide, Lee told Abe: \"South Korea has also respected and complied with the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations and Claims, and will continue to do so,\" according to Seoul's statement.\n\nLee, who was in Tokyo to attend Japanese Emperor Naruhito's enthronement ceremony this week, delivered to Abe a personal letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in in which Moon called for attempts to resolve the pending bilateral issues, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nMoon and Abe have not held a summit in more than a year and the statements made no mention of any meeting planned between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIFFICULT HISTORY\n\nThe animosity between Japan and South Korea is linked to the history of Japan's 1910-45 colonisation of the Korean peninsula, the mobilisation of forced labour at companies and women in wartime military brothels, and a row over the ownership of islets in the sea between the two nations.\n\nEarlier this year, the dispute escalated when Japan tightened export controls on materials vital for South Korean chipmakers. It then dropped Seoul from a list of countries eligible for fast-track exports, steps angrily denounced by South Korea.\n\nThe spat has prompted protests in South Korea, where Japanese companies and products have been boycotted, and trade between the two countries has slowed sharply.\n\nIn August, South Korea announced it would scrap a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan when it expires next month, just as the allies face rising tensions over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme and increased competition from China and Russia.\n\nFurther potential flashpoints loom.\n\nThousands of South Korean students and activists are expected to gather on Friday to celebrate \"Dokdo day\". Dokdo is the Korean name for islets claimed by South Korea and by Japan, which calls them Takeshima.\n\nSouth Korea is also planning to order asset sales of the Japanese companies found liable for damages under last year's forced labour rulings as early as December, which could further sour bilateral relations, analysts said.\n\n\"Precautions must be taken to prevent that,\" said Yang Kee-ho, professor of Japanese Studies at Sungkonghoe University.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka in Tokyo and Joyce Lee in Seoul; writing by Linda Sieg and Elaine Lies; Editing by Lincoln Feast)", "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon agreed on Thursday on the need to cooperate on North Korea despite frigid bilateral ties, but Abe repeated that Seoul needed to keep its promises for relations to improve.
