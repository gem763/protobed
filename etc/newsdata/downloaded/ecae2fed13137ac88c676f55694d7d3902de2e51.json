The head of his agency\u2019s asylum office is being removed from his job and reassigned. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News)\n\nThe head of the asylum office at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is being removed from his job and reassigned, a move that follows multiple White House-directed attempts to raise new barriers to those seeking humanitarian refuge in the United States.\n\nJohn Lafferty, a career official who has run the asylum division for six years, will become deputy director at the D.C.-area USCIS processing center, according to an email sent to staff on Wednesday. The position appears to be a demotion.\n\nLafferty received a leadership award last year from the agency\u2019s then-director, L. Francis Cissna. But the asylum division of USCIS under Lafferty has been a source of frustration to immigration hard-liners in the White House, especially senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nCissna was pushed out in May, when the White House installed former Virginia attorney general and conservative activist Ken Cuccinelli as acting director.\n\nLinda Rivas is an El Paso-based immigration attorney whose work regularly takes her to the dangerous Mexican border city of Juarez, where thousands of migrants are stranded as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s new asylum policies. The work is pushing her to the limit, and there are too many people who need her help. (REF:murphyz0-v/The Washington Post)\n\nFor years, Miller and others in the administration have argued the officers who screen migrants seeking safe refuge are often too sympathetic during initial screening interviews and too credulous while evaluating their stories of persecution and hardship. Tightening the asylum process has been a priority for the White House, which argues the humanitarian program is being abused by a flood of Central American migrants filing meritless claims to gain easy entry to the United States.\n\nA pilot program launched this year with Miller\u2019s backing has trained Border Patrol agents to conduct screening interviews in place of asylum officers, with the assumption that they will take a more skeptical and adversarial approach.\n\nLafferty was well-liked by the agency\u2019s roughly 500 asylum officers, who have been working long hours in recent years amid a soaring number of border-crossers seeking to halt the deportation process by citing a fear of harm if sent home.\n\n\u201cHe was pro-asylum officer,\u201d said one officer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters. \u201cHe clearly respected their work, and you could tell he wasn\u2019t too enthused about the various new policies under the Trump administration.\u201d\n\n[U.S. asylum officers say \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy is threatening migrants\u2019 lives, ask federal court to end it]\n\nThe officers, many of whom are trained in refugee work and human rights law, typically administer extensive interviews to those seeking protection to determine whether the applicants should be referred to the U.S. immigration court system. About 80 percent of applicants pass that initial threshold, but asylum officers and many immigration scholars say that is not because the officers are too sympathetic to migrants. U.S. asylum laws are written to err on the side of leniency, they say, to avoid deporting someone who might be killed or harmed in their native country.\n\nTrump has repeatedly mocked the humanitarian program and has told crowds that dangerous criminals are using it to game the system.\n\n\u201cThe asylum program is a scam,\u201d Trump said in a speech earlier this year. Among those gaining entry to the United States, he said, are \u201csome of the roughest people you\u2019ve ever seen, people that look like they should be fighting for the UFC [Ultimate Fighting Championship] . . . you look at this guy, you say \u2018Wow, that\u2019s a tough cookie!\u2019 \u201d\n\nTensions between the administration\u2019s political appointees and asylum officers surfaced in court earlier this year when the union representing the staffers sued in federal court seeking to block President Trump\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, which requires asylum applicants to remain outside U.S. territory while their cases are processed. The union said the policy was contrary to the \u201cmoral fabric\u201d of the nation.\n\nA USCIS official said the agency has the authority to reassign these high-level managers to best serve its needs. Andrew Davidson, a career official who currently runs the agency\u2019s fraud detection unit, will replace Lafferty on an acting basis, according to a USCIS staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose personnel moves.", "description": "John Lafferty, who ran the asylum division for six years, won a leadership award in 2018.", "authors": ["Nick Miroff", "Reporter Covering Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security", "Nick Miroff Covers Immigration Enforcement", "The Department Of Homeland Security For The Washington Post.
