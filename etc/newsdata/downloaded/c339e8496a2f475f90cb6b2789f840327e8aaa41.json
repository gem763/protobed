The Canadians put a ring around this match after becoming the last team to qualify 11 months ago.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit of an empty feeling,\u201d Canada coach Kingsley Jones said. \u201cI feel the team\u2019s grown, but we haven\u2019t actually been able to measure our growth. The opposition were about the same level as us. We wanted to measure ourselves here.\n\n\u201cI believe we would have won today. That would have given us a sense of an outcome. This feels like there\u2019s no outcome at the moment. It\u2019s a bit raw.\u201d\n\nDavies said the cancellation was logical: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so much rain - and being from Wales we see a lot of rain - but it\u2019s been phenomenal.\u201d\n\nDavies said he was sold on Namibia\u2019s amateur ethos but professional attitude when he turned up at scrum training at 5:30 a.m. four years ago.\n\n\u201cThe amount of commitment and effort they\u2019ve put in over the last four years has been monumental, phenomenal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last two World Cups have brought pride, passion and respect to Namibian rugby and built on the legacies of the previous four World Cups. The players have to take huge credit for that.\u201d\n\nHe said the performances on the field have been getting better with each run, and he reflected on the big first half against New Zealand.\n\n\u201cLast week was a highlight for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough the scoreboard was unkind in the end (71-9), to be 10-9 with the world champions after 35 minutes was a testament to how far the players have come over the past four years.\u201d\n\nHe was proud of where he leaves Namibia, with the establishment of a national academy four years ago and a high-performance center at the national stadium.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been the Africa champions for four years,\u201d he added. \u201cFor the 2015 World Cup, Namibia qualified on points difference. This time we\u2019ve been the champions for four years in Africa and the players take massive credit for that. There\u2019s a legacy built that can create a bright future for Namibian rugby.\n\n\u201cThe challenge for the current board is to grow the development side of the game, which for me is the club game. There are some tremendous clubs in Namibia but to go from seven to 10 clubs in the next four-year cycle, to go from 900 players to 4,000 playing the game, and also establish a quality sevens program would be amazing.\u201d\n\nLike Namibia, Canada lost to New Zealand and Italy, and was on a five-day turnaround after a heavy loss to South Africa.\n\n\u201cI still feel the group has grown,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young players who have got a lot of experience. About 19, 18 of these players will have the ability to play in 2023. We\u2019re in a good place in terms of young rugby players. It\u2019s just making sure that those players get into a daily training environment (in Major League Rugby).\u201d\n\nWith no game to play and a mess around them in Kamaishi left by the typhoon, about 15 Canada players and staff grabbed shovels and brooms to sweep mud and debris off roads, and even from inside residents\u2019 homes.\n\n\u201cIn times like this there are an awful lot more important things than rugby, and when we got here we saw people\u2019s houses absolutely destroyed, water (rising) up the walls,\u201d Canada flyhalf Peter Nelson said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying our very small part to help them in any way we can.\u201d\n\nLock Josh Larsen added: \u201cWe felt for the people of Kamaishi. (We\u2019re) happy to help.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It wasn't the way Namibia and Canada wanted to end long losing streaks at the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Foster Niumata"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
