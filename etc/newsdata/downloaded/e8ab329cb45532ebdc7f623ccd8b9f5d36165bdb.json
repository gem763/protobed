The changes led to the arrest of dozens of high-ranking officials on charges of torture and corruption and to a relaxing of laws restricting the work of civil society organisations and opposition groups.\n\nOn July 9 of that same year, the two neighbours signed an agreement that demarcated their border and resumed diplomatic relations between them.\n\nIn a statement, Ahmed said that \"this victory and recognition is a collective win for Ethiopians, and a call to strengthen our resolve in making Ethiopia \u2014 the New Horizon of Hope \u2014 a prosperous nation for all.\"\n\nThe European Commission congratulated Ahmed for his win, writing on Twitter that \"with his courage, he built bridges in the region, restarting peace talks after 20 years of stalemate with Eritrea.\"\n\n\"We stand with Ethiopia in its journey towards democratic reform and peace,\" it added.\n\nAhmed was among the favourites to win alongside Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and Native Brazilian leader and environmentalist Raoni Metuktire for his work to protect the Amazon.\n\nEarlier this week, the winners for Physiology or Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, and Literature were announced.", "description": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Ahmed was given the prize \"for his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea\".", "authors": ["Alice Tidey"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/36/14/1000x563_cmsv2_9719721f-ceca-5199-ae2d-64317c10b51b-4223614.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
