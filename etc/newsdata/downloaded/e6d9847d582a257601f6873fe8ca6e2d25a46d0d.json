It hasn\u2019t required the hiring of any dumpster-diving private detectives (so far as we know). It hasn\u2019t even really required any elected Democratic officials.\n\nThe campaign has been carried out by an elite media \u2014 and two of its most prestigious properties, The New York Times and The New Yorker \u2014 that prides itself on its standards and its Olympian status.\n\nThe New Yorker first published during his confirmation hearings an allegation by Deborah Ramirez that Kavanaugh exposed himself at a party at Yale when they were both students. Ramirez spent almost a week \u201cassessing her memories\u201d before making the charge and told friends that she wasn\u2019t sure it was him. No eyewitness places Kavanaugh in the room.\n\nIt was in support of The New Yorker story that shouldn\u2019t have been published that The New York Times issued forth with its own piece over the weekend that also shouldn\u2019t have been published, an excerpt from a new anti-Kavanaugh book by two Times reporters.\n\nThe essay floated the allegation that he exposed himself to another woman at another Yale party but left out that the woman\u2019s friends say she doesn\u2019t recall the incident (she declined to be interviewed).\n\nHere, we have one flimsy, uncorroborated story in the Times being advanced to buttress another flimsy, uncorroborated story in The New Yorker, which, in its turn, was supposed to lend credence to Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s original flimsy, uncorroborated story.\n\nKavanaugh\u2019s enemies believe that layering on dubious allegations somehow makes each one more credible, whereas it only speaks to their own desperation.\n\nBelatedly, the Times amended the essay and appended an editor\u2019s note alerting readers that a key \u2014 no, the key \u2014 piece of information about the alleged victim had been left out of the original version.\n\nSurely, if a piece had causally smeared anyone with whom the Times has a natural affinity, say, Rachel Maddow or Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there would have been editorial due diligence before publishing it. But Kavanaugh, as a privileged white male who might vote against Roe, is a hate figure who is presumed guilty, even of an offense that it turns out his alleged victim isn\u2019t accusing him of.\n\nThe larger point of the Times book excerpt is that Kavanaugh was privileged and Deborah Ramirez was not, so of course he must have thoughtlessly done something rotten to her at Yale.\n\nsee also Mitch McConnell defends Brett Kavanaugh amid NY Times misconduct report Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell defended Brett Kavanaugh and trashed...\n\nAs for Roe, Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s lawyer, Debra Katz, made it explicit: \u201cHe will always have an asterisk next to his name,\u201d Katz explained in remarks claiming moral victory from the Senate hearings. \u201cWhen he takes a scalpel to Roe v. Wade, we will know who he is, we know his character and we know what motivates him.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the talking point is all cued up if Kavanaugh votes against Roe: He\u2019s a misogynist showing his disdain for women yet again.\n\nTop Democrats understand the play. They immediately began calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cHis place on the Court,\u201d according to Kamala Harris, \u201cis an insult to the pursuit of justice.\u201d Top-tier presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren joined the calls, as did a number of the single-digit candidates.\n\nNo one revised and extended their remarks after the update by the Times, because this has nothing to do with evidence or fairness.\n\nIn part, the Left is working the ref \u2014 by essentially asking the ref when he stopped beating his wife. If Kavanaugh never votes to overturn or erode Roe, at least the volume of the vitriol against him will diminish. If he does, the full fury of the Left, mustering all the levers of its cultural power high and low, will be directed at him.\n\nThe pro-abortion forces surely want Kavanaugh aware of this whenever he\u2019s hearing any abortion-related cases.\n\nThe anti-Kavanaugh campaign could be just beginning.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry", "description": "The campaign has been carried out by an elite media \u2014 and two of its most prestigious properties, The New York Times and The New Yorker \u2014 that prides itself on its standards and its Olympian status.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/brett-kavanaugh-times.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
