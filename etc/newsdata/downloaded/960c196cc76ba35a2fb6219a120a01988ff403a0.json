If you were a fan of Joe Keery's thick, wavy tresses, you'll be pissed to find out that he cut it all off. People get haircuts all the time\u2014it's just how hair and the world works! But as InStyle put it, Joe's hair has become part of his whole persona and everyone has become obsessed with his mullet ever since he grew it out for Stranger Things. He's basically like the Ethan Craft of 2019, and we need to know if he lathers, rinses, and repeats, if he air dries or blow dries with a barrel brush, and if there's any pomade involved. We have questions!!! But now, IDK if we'll ever get the answers to them because Joe just went and chopped all his hair off into a bowl cut!\n\nI wish I was joking, but his mullet is no more and all that's left is some forehead bangs and a long sideburn situation. Here's Joe before:\n\nView photos Photo credit: Matt Winkelmeyer - Getty Images More\n\nRIP to that look.\n\nAnd here he is now:\n\nView photos Photo credit: Stefanie Keenan - Getty Images More\n\nY'all, I-\n\nView photos Photo credit: STEFANIE< KEENAN QWZZ] - Getty Images More\n\nJoe debuted this new look last night at the launch of the new Chanel fragrance, but honestly, it's hard to tell if this is his vibe now or if it's for a role. (His IMDB page says he has one movie, Free Guy, coming up in 2020, but that's in post-production already, so this could very well just be his own doing.)\n\nBut after looking at it for a minute, the shock has worn off and it's starting to look a bit rock 'n' roll like the dudes from Oasis, no? Or a bit like The Beatles?\n\nLet's just be glad hair grows back.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "I'd like to speak with the manager, please.", "authors": ["Shannon Barbour"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_RARpT0_4qrm0actWi50UQ--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/667192f837a3158960bd9f08a7142883", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
