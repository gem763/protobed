With all my other tattoos, you always have the haters.\n\n\"It's my body, it's what I do and I know it's going to be there for the rest of my life.\n\n\"It's just your choice that you make to have something to look at.\"\n\nMcCloud said she had various tattoos on her body, some symbolising meaningful moments for her and others that were just decorative.\n\n\"I'm saying, I'm not going anywhere because I do have the option of leaving and I don't want to leave because this is my country and I love it.\n\n\"It's also for my son so that he can grow up in the country of his birth and be closer to family as well - not leaving everybody behind,\" McCloud said.\n\nShe added she was staying in South Africa for a number of reasons.\n\n\"It's everything, it's the people, it's the beauty of everything.\"\n\nAmid weeks of bad news earlier this year, the Facebook group #ImStaying emerged with the goal to \"unite all South Africans\".\n\nIt provides a platform for South Africans to share their stories of why they love the country and why they choose to stay despite its problems.\n\n\"Just to see all the positive things and not being negative, that's one of the major things as well,\" McCloud said of joining the group.\n\n\"Everybody needs hope and the page just does that, it shows people that there is love and there is unity.\"", "description": "\"Permanent stay\" has taken on a whole new meaning for a Johannesburg women who tattooed #ImStaying on her body.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9475/26017efc29534bf1833c5684f94c8f6a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
