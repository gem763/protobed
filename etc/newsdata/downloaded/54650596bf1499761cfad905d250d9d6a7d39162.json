That's why we're stopping at the moon. I said, 'hey, we've already done the moon. That's not so exciting'. They said, 'no, sir, it's a launching pad for Mars'. So we'll be doing the moon but we'll really be doing Mars.\"", "description": "Australia will invest A$150 million ($101 million) in its companies and technology to help President Trump's bid for a moon landing by 2024.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d872a4b2e22af3da8531682-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
