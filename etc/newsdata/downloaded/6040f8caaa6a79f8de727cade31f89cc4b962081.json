His latest book is the 2018 poetry collection Self-Defence for the Brave and Happy.\n\nIf he had to name one book that he's loved reading over and over again it would have to be the poetry collection Testament by iconic Canadian poet Dennis Lee.\n\n\"Testament gathers together two books of Dennis Lee's: Un and Yesno. In these books he smashes language apart and builds new poems with the bits and pieces of what's left over. This is symbolic of our struggle with environmental crisis and our ability to relate to the planet.\n\n\"But there's also a glimmer of hope as language begins to reassemble itself toward the end of the book. I recommend it highly.\"\n\nPaul Vermeersch's comments have been edited for length and clarity.", "description": "The Toronto-based poet shares his favourite book of poetry with The Next Chapter.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5325892.1571408076!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/paul-vermeersch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
