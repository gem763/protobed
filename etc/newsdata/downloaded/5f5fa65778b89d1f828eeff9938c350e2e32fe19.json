Comey didn\u2019t leak classified information to the press, but he mishandled his memos detailing conversations with President Trump and jeopardized the FBI\u2019s investigation by giving non-secret details to reporters for his personal gain, an inspector general concluded Thursday.\n\nThe 83-page report by the Justice Department\u2019s internal watchdog accused Mr. Comey of hypocrisy, saying he preached integrity of investigations even as he was leaking information from the probes.\n\n\u201cBy not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees \u2014 and the many thousands more former FBI employees \u2014 who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information,\u201d the inspector general concluded.\n\nInvestigators said Mr. Comey did provide classified information from the memos to his legal team. Some information from the memos was leaked, on Mr. Comey\u2019s orders, though that didn\u2019t include the small classified portions.\n\nStill, the former director\u2019s behavior did violate FBI policy in keeping the memos for his personal use and in releasing them without authorization.\n\nInvestigators said they referred their findings to the Justice Department, citing several laws that the former director may have violated. The department declined to prosecute Mr. Comey.\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Comey characterized the report as vindication because it concluded he didn\u2019t leak classified information.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u2018sorry we lied about you\u2019 would be nice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u2018going to jail\u2019 or being a \u2018liar and a leaker\u2019 \u2014 ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president.\u201d\n\nIf that was meant as an invitation for a mea culpa from Mr. Trump, it didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cPerhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector General\u2019s Report,\u201d the president said in his distinctive Twitter style. \u201cHe should be ashamed of himself!\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said the report found Mr. Comey misused his confidential communications with the president for personal gain.\n\n\u201cHis actions were disgraceful and part of a wider effort within the Obama Justice Department to undermine President Trump,\u201d Mr. Jordan said.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the inspector general\u2019s report was \u201ca stunning and unprecedented rebuke\u201d of someone who used to lead the country\u2019s preeminent law enforcement agency.\n\nRep. Paul A. Gosar, Arizona Republican, was more direct: \u201cTo call James Comey a clown would be offensive to the carnival community.\u201d\n\nInvestigators said Mr. Comey was guilty of hypocrisy, having extolled the importance of respecting the rules yet breaking them when he felt it would advance his own interests.\n\nThey rejected his defense that he was acting out of patriotism, saying if every FBI employee followed that rule, then it would leave the bureau unable to operate.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s report is part of a broader investigation into the way the FBI handled Mr. Trump both during the 2016 presidential campaign and as it investigated Russian meddling in the election.\n\nThe memos are a small but fascinating part of that.\n\nMr. Comey wrote them after seven of his nine one-on-one conversations with Mr. Trump from the presidential transition period through his firing in May 2017.\n\nThe first memo documented Mr. Comey\u2019s astounding initial meeting with Mr. Trump on Jan. 7, 2017, when he informed the president-elect of contents of the so-called Steele dossier, a now largely discredited document that suggested Russian officials had dirt on Mr. Trump but which the FBI treated as valid evidence in 2016.\n\nMr. Comey did officially mark that memo \u201cSecret.\u201d\n\nOfficials later designated parts of Memos 2, 3 and 7 as \u201cclassified.\u201d\n\nThe memos generally detailed conversations with Mr. Trump about Mr. Comey\u2019s future at the FBI and aspects of the ongoing counterintelligence investigation aimed at Trump associates, officially known in the FBI as \u201cCrossfire Hurricane.\u201d Mr. Trump was not told of the investigation.\n\nMr. Comey kept copies of Memos 2, 4, 6 and 7 after he was fired from the FBI, violating the policy and the terms of employment he signed. If he wanted to keep copies, then he should have asked permission, the inspector general said. But investigators said Mr. Comey didn\u2019t tell anyone he kept copies, even though FBI employees went to his home to remove all FBI property.\n\nHe also broke the rules when he told a friend of his, who was acting as his attorney, to provide some of the contents of Memo 4 to The New York Times in May 2017, the report concluded.\n\nIn that memo, written on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2017, Mr. Comey acknowledged he was beginning to gather information to protect himself. He said he left out some information to keep the memo unclassified, specifically so he could keep it at his home.\n\nJust two months earlier, Mr. Comey \u201cproperly\u201d declined to reveal the information from that memo when asked by Congress, but he had it leaked for his own purposes after his firing, the investigators said.\n\nMr. Comey told investigators he saw himself in a unique position to defend the country. He said he leaked the information to try to pressure the Justice Department to name a special counsel to investigate Mr. Trump.\n\nThat is indeed what happened, with the special counsel finally completing the investigation this year.\n\nThe probe found there wasn\u2019t evidence to accuse Mr. Trump of conspiring with Russia to subvert the 2016 election, though there was suspicious behavior in the president\u2019s attempts to thwart the investigation. The Justice Department concluded that there was no chargeable crime.\n\nDavid Stebenne, a professor at Ohio State University who specializes in the history of the FBI, said Mr. Comey\u2019s \u201clack of contrition\u201d about the report Thursday was surprising.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s claiming he\u2019s vindicated because the documents weren\u2019t classified. That doesn\u2019t mean what he was doing was right. There is something strange about that, and it doesn\u2019t look good for him or the FBI,\u201d the professor said.\n\nMr. Stebenne said Mr. Comey has become \u201ca man without a country,\u201d lacking defenders in either party because Democrats still hold his conduct of the Hillary Clinton email investigation against him, some blaming him for her election defeat.\n\nMr. Comey appears to be more interested in promoting himself, Mr. Stebenne said.\n\n\u201cIn a sense, he has profited from what he did, and that bothers a lot of people,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are not supposed to write a tell-all or tell-some as an ex-FBI director. FBI directors are supposed to keep secrets.\u201d\n\nLew Schiliro, former head of the FBI\u2019s New York field office, said Mr. Comey injected politics into something that should have been free from that taint.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond what any FBI director or agent would do. I look at what he did, and I just don\u2019t understand it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe violated an FBI policy. If he thinks this report is vindication, then he needs to take another look at it. He should apologize to the American people for what he did to the FBI. It was under his watch that people were sending inappropriate text messages. It was under his watch we had the politicization of the FBI. He ought to thank his lucky stars he\u2019s not being prosecuted.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
