For A-listers and senior royalty \u2014 including the Duchess of Cambridge \u2014 she is their secret weapon.\n\nHer pieces have vintage charm, with a modern edge. Like body armour, they make the wearer feel as comfortable as possible \u2018but just push the edge a little bit\u2019, she explains.\n\nWhether for the BAFTAs, Royal Ascot, a family wedding or a royal engagement, they can be sure they\u2019ll look impeccable.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge's secret fashion weapon is designer Suzannah Crabb, who has a small shop based in Marylebone\n\nHer sister Pippa Middleton is also known to be a fan of the designer, and is shown here wearing one of her dresses to the christening of Prince George in St James's Palace, London\n\nAt this year\u2019s Wimbledon, the Duchess of Cambridge looked beautiful in her white crepe button-up Flippy Wiggle dress. Back in 2014, she wore a green and white Suzannah tea dress for Prince George\u2019s first birthday portraits. It looked like a floral print, but actually, the motif was a budding heart.\n\n\u2018All my prints have character,\u2019 says Suzannah. \u2018There\u2019s always a bit of a twist.\u2019 You sense it\u2019s a way of making a famous woman look modern and fashion-relevant without scaring the horses.\n\nThe Duchess\u2019s sister, Pippa Middleton, is also a fan. She wore Suzannah\u2019s mint-green floral tea dress to Wimbledon and, on another occasion, a Thirties-inspired ivory and pink Monaco dress with a ruffled hemline.\n\nSophie Wessex, meanwhile, has chosen a succession of Suzannah\u2019s coat and tea dresses for royal events. \u2018She is a loyal client of ours, and really lovely and supportive. And a great brand ambassador: she\u2019s so elegant,\u2019 says the designer. \u2018She\u2019s got very good taste and is quite bold. She\u2019s got her own sense of style.\u2019\n\nBlonde, ultra-discreet, but with a distinctive, throaty laugh, Crabb, 44, makes clothes that are almost couture.\n\nPippa Middleton pictured sporting a beautiful Suzannah Crabb dress at Wimbledon in 2015\n\nThe Countess of Wessex, shown here at a 2016 charity dinner in Broadgate, London, is also a fan and has worn her dresses for royal events\n\nIn her private atelier, she creates exquisite pieces for her bespoke clients and, in her Suzannah boutique across the street, she sells ready-to-wear \u2014 the perfect Forties-inspired navy shift coats and variations of her bestselling silk tea dresses for around \u00a3900.\n\nNo, they\u2019re not cheap. That\u2019s because the designer sources her fabrics mostly from Italy, supervising the dyeing, weaving and printing before every garment is lined in silk. These are heirlooms for the future.\n\nSuzannah Crabb said that she creates all her pieces bespoke for clients, in order to achieve the perfect fit\n\n\u2018We make mannequins in the size of the client and fit the piece as we go. The fabrics are precious and exclusive. They have to be cut with precision.\u2019\n\nEverything is lovingly designed from scratch, from shoulder pads to buttons. The Swarovski crystal buttons on her new Courtauld dress are like an art piece.\n\nDesigns are a reinterpretation of vintage classics rather than slavish copies. She\u2019ll take apart a 1940s couture dress to understand the construction, then exaggerate the silhouette, as our shoulders and waists are wider today.\n\nShe rations black. Her clients, she believes, need bolder colours and beautiful neutrals. Many prints are collaborations with artists. The print on her floaty Carousel dress, made from Italian silk organdie, looks like flowers, but is actually tiny flies \u2014 \u2018so it\u2019s a quirky print, although it looks demure.\u2019\n\nEven with the ready-to-wear, she\u2019ll make only a handful of pieces. So it\u2019s \u2018pretty rare\u2019 to meet someone at a party in the same dress. Handy if you\u2019re a duchess.\n\nEach season, Suzannah adapts the tea dress, a bestseller for 13 years, changing the print designs, neckline and sleeve length. \u2018Some of the ladies have collected all of them. They call it their uniform.\u2019\n\nSuzannah fans include, clockwise from above, the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured here with Prince William on George\u2019s first birthday. Kate is wearing a Suzannah Crabb dress\n\nFor this winter, she\u2019s designed many midi lengths. \u2018You don\u2019t have to worry about your tights, or whether you have tanned legs. I always wear nice sneakers, and they look great with that length.\u2019\n\nCrabb grew up in Hull, where her mother taught her to sew. She later studied textiles and then fashion at the Universities of York and Southampton.\n\nShe worked as a designer at Karen Millen, Esprit and Oasis, travelling to factories and cloth mills around the world, and later joined Marks & Spencer as head of womenswear trend forecasting. In 2006, she opened her first shop.\n\nBut the real success did not come for another five years. It was after Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s wedding in 2011, she says, that business boomed: people wanted to dress up and look \u2018polished\u2019 again. \u2018Women shop with us for occasions when they have to be at their most confident in life. We work tirelessly to get the ultimate fit for each garment.\u2019\n\nEveryone in the street benefits from our clientele. They say: \u201cOh, crikey, was that such and such? Was she in your shop?\u201d And I just smile\n\nSome clients want to make a splash; others to be chic, but anonymous (for example, at a friend\u2019s wedding). \u2018People say: \u201cI want to feel my absolute best, but I don\u2019t want to stand out.\u201d So we choose a more demure piece, maybe take the colour down a bit.\u2019\n\nAs well as various members of the Royal Family and actresses such as Helen Mirren and Emilia Fox, Suzannah dresses serious professional women who may not have time to change after work.\n\nThe Evangeline white and navy dress in her new collection, for example, is a brilliant modernist piece with a high neck (\u2018so you\u2019re very covered\u2019), but it skims the body in a very feminine way.\n\nWith a six-year-old daughter, Stella, she understands juggling work and the school run. She wears every prototype herself. \u2018We road-test everything: does it crease, can I sit in it, is it too short?\u2019\n\nSuzannah also makes bridal wear and, when she married her banker boyfriend, Adam, in 2011, she designed her own Thirties-style, full-length, corseted dress.\n\nJust before her wedding, journalist Mary Wakefield (now the wife of Boris Johnson\u2019s political strategist Dominic Cummings) ricocheted into the shop, saw Suzannah\u2019s popular Astor dress and begged to be fitted for her own version. Two days before Suzannah got hitched, she was on her hands and knees stitching Mary\u2019s dress.\n\nSince moving into Marylebone, Suzannah has found local businesses to be supportive. \u2018Everyone in the street benefits from our clientele. They say: \u201cOh, crikey, was that such and such? Was she in your shop?\u201d And I just smile.\u2019", "description": "Senior royalty and A-listers use Marylebone designer Suzannah Crabb as their secret weapon.
