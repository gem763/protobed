She was found guilty of only one charge: gross abuse of a corpse. The jury deliberated for four hours and 25 minutes.\n\nIn court on Friday, the judge ordered that Richardson serve three years of probation. She was sentenced to seven days in jail, with credit for the seven days she already served. If she violates her probation, she can spend up to a year in jail.\n\nBefore the sentencing, Richardson\u2019s father, Scott Richardson, addressed the court and asked for his daughter to be released. \u201cMy daughter is suffering from an eating disorder and we are concerned about her health,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson\u2019s then-boyfriend, Trey Johnson, was the baby\u2019s father. Johnson\u2019s mother read an emotional statement during court. \u201cNot only did I lose my first grandchild, but my baby boy lost his daughter,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cFor a baby that she called \u2018it,\u2019 we\u2019re just as much the family as she is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched my son become a different person,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cI won\u2019t disclose his medical diagnosis because she\u2019s done enough to him. I can personally tell you that I\u2019ve personally been seen for depression, panic attacks, and I\u2019m a shell of the person I was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have taken her in with Trey without a question. Now, instead, every May 7, I don\u2019t get to have a birthday party for my first grandchild. Instead, I send her balloons to heaven, to tell her how much her daddy loved her, and how much I loved her.\u201d\n\nBrooke Skylar Richardson cries as she is found not guilty of killing her baby | WLWT5 More\n\nRichardson then addressed the court.\n\n\u201cI would do anything that you ask,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cI can sometimes be selfish, but I\u2019m getting better. I\u2019m forever sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ve hurt a lot of people. I am really, really sorry. And I understand.\u201d\n\nJudge Donald Oda II reprimanded Richardson while making his decision and referenced the baby, who had been named Annabelle.\n\n\u201cI believe if you had made different decisions, Annabelle would still be here,\u201d Oda said. \u201cI think that your choices before birth, during birth and after birth show a grotesque disregard for life.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ex-Cheerleader Accused of Killing Newborn Blew off Doctors\u2019 Calls, Didn\u2019t Have Ultrasound: Prosecutors", "description": "Brooke Skylar Richardson Sentenced to Probation", "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/45ENXgTc3DEHXpVGJcs0lw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/fa66ec21b1a71513867a34d4faa78d38", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
