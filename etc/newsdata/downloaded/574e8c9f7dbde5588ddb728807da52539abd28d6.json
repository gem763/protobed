However, it is an example of complexity, and cannot be justified by any funding advantage because Telstra is already considered a high-quality issuer within the parameters of credit analysis.\n\n\"Managements and boards are increasingly finding ways to distort cash flow statements. This is deeply concerning to us,\" Merlon's Hamish Carlisle wrote in new analysis shared with clients.\n\nNo cashflow change\n\nTelstra's position is that reverse factoring does not represent a cashflow change, because the liability is not transferred. \u201cTelstra does not receive any free cashflow benefit if our suppliers choose to make use of supply chain financing,\" a spokesman said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccounting standards allow discretion as to whether such facilities are presented as financing cashflow or operating cashflow, depending on the substance of the transaction. Equity investors place a high reliance on a company's cashflow statements.\n\nMerlon also mounts the case - which Telstra disputes - that the telco's decision to stop offering handset leasing coincided with its compliance with an accounting standard requiring off balance sheet leases to be brought on balance sheet.\n\nTelstra used to lease handsets and then sublease them to customers in what is known as a \"back to back\" arrangement. Under such an arrangement, it acts as both lessor and lessee.\n\nMerlon writes: \"It seems the new accounting standards for operating leases have thwarted the cosmetic appeal of the 'back-to-back' lease arrangement and led Telstra to revert to a more conventional approach of carrying receivables on its own balance sheet.\"\n\nTelstra says the decision to stop handset leasing had nothing to do with the accounting change, known as AASB16, and only reflected the simplification of its offering to customers. It has reduced the mobile plans on offer to just 20.\n\n\u201cTelstra stopped offering mobile lease plans in June 2019 as part of our work to simplify our business and improve the experiences of our customers. It was not related to the introduction of the new AASB16 accounting standard,\" its spokesman said. \u201cWe are proud of the level of transparency offered to shareholders and potential investors through our financial disclosures.\u201d\n\nThe company has told the market to expect a $1 billion working capital increase in 2019-20, including the effect of exiting mobile lease plans, as part of its free cashflow guidance.\n\nMerlon hypothesises that back-to-back handset leasing boosted Telstra's cashflow by around $500 million over 2016-17 and 2017-18 based on its analysis of lease receivables from retail customers. The benefit in 2018-19 was tiny at just $37 million.", "description": "Fund manager Merlon says Telstra's accounts are confusing and its use of supply chain finance, and previously back-to-back leases, blur the true cashflow picture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.236%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/92802f7bc8938ec2ec897d15aa541fb766fe306d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
