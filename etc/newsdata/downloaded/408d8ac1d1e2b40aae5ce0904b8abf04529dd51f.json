REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said some motor finance brokers receive commission linked to the interest rate that customers pay.\n\n\u201cThe broker can set that rate and the FCA found that the widespread use of this type of commission creates an incentive for brokers to act against customers\u2019 interests,\u201d the FCA said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe Finance & Leasing Association (FLA) said the FCA\u2019s proposals would deliver clear rules and a consistent approach to commissions.\n\n\u201cMany lenders have already moved to the commission models that the FCA is proposing,\u201d said Adrian Dally, the FLA\u2019s head of motor finance.\n\nThe National Franchised Dealers Association said rules should be proportionate so there is a satisfactory outcome for both consumers and retailers, while consultants PwC cautioned that the crackdown could lead to higher flat fee commission payments.\n\nUsing models to compare discretionary commission and flat fee models of financing, the FCA estimated that 924,000 customers were paying in total around 500 million pounds in additional interest costs.\n\nBanning this type of commission would remove an incentive for brokers to bump up the interest rate that customers pay and give lenders more control over the prices customers pay for their motor finance, the watchdog said.\n\n\u201cBy banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market which will ultimately save customers money,\u201d said Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u2019s executive director of strategy and competition.\n\nShares of motor retailer Pendragon (PDG.L), which jumped 10% on Monday, were up 1.3% in early trading. Auto Trader (AUTOA.L) gained 1%.\n\n\u201cGiven the largest commissions received by brokers tend to come via the models set to be banned, it will be interesting to see how lenders, brokers and dealerships react,\u201d said Sarah Nield, financial services risk and regulation director at PwC.\n\nThe FCA is also proposing changes to commission disclosure rules and guidance to give consumers more relevant information in all consumer credit markets.\n\nThe watchdog will consult on the rules until January 2020 and publish final rules later next year.\n\nIt estimates it would cost the industry 35 million pounds to implement the ban in the first year, and 5 million pounds annually thereafter.", "description": "Britain's markets watchdog has proposed banning auto dealers and brokers from receiving commission linked to interest rates on loans used to finance car purchases, a step it said would save consumers 165 million pounds ($208.4 million) annually.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441031533&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0GR", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
