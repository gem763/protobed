It would also allow committee staffers for both the Democratic and Republican sides of the panel to question witnesses for an extra hour, part of an effort to elicit more useful information.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Judiciary Committee will vote on the resolution on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented corruption, coverup, and crimes by the president are under investigation by the committee as we determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment or other Article 1 remedies,\u201d Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cThe adoption of these additional procedures is the next step in that process and will help ensure our impeachment hearings are informative to Congress and the public, while providing the president with the ability to respond to evidence presented against him.\u201d\n\nThough the measure is largely technical \u2014 it\u2019s titled \u201cResolution for Investigative Procedures\u201d \u2014 it is the first effort by lawmakers to acknowledge the committee\u2019s consideration of whether to recommend Trump\u2019s impeachment, following a six-week recess during which many House Democrats expressed confusion about the status of impeachment proceedings.\n\nUntil this week, the committee had been writing in court filings that it is actively considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president, the first such acknowledgment. In addition, Nadler has referred to his committee\u2019s probe as \u201cformal impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nNew Window INTERACTIVE: See which House lawmakers support impeachment.\n\nBut Speaker Nancy Pelosi has continued to resist a formal impeachment inquiry, leading to confusion among some House Democrats over the Judiciary panel\u2019s investigation.\n\nAllowing the president's lawyers to access evidence and witnesses is the latest move by the Judiciary Committee to make its long-running probes of Trump look more like impeachment inquiries that occurred during the Nixon and Clinton presidencies. One such procedure that mirrors past impeachment processes involves sensitive grand-jury materials. The resolution allows lawmakers to review such evidence in classified settings.\n\nRepublicans were already accusing Democrats on Monday of trying to circumvent House rules by refusing to hold a full House vote on opening an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cJudiciary Democrats are trying to pull a fast one on Americans,\u201d said Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel. \u201cThey know they don\u2019t have the votes for the whole House to impeach, so they\u2019re trying to adopt committee rules to govern an \u2018impeachment investigation\u2019 the House hasn\u2019t even authorized.\u201d\n\nThe measure largely focuses on former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which included allegations that Trump sought to obstruct justice by thwarting the probe.\n\nThe resolution does not, however, mention recent allegations that Trump has violated the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clauses, even as House Democrats have ramped up their rhetoric about the potential violations in the wake of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s recent stay at a Trump-owned property in Ireland, and Trump\u2019s public suggestion that the next G7 summit be held at his resort in Doral, Florida.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s crimes and corruption extend beyond what is detailed in the Mueller report,\u201d Nadler added. \u201cThe president is in violation of the emoluments clauses of the Constitution as he works to enrich himself, putting the safety and security of our nation at risk.\u201d\n\nThe committee is also expected to review Trump\u2019s alleged role in an illegal hush-money scheme to silence women who alleged that they had affairs with him, in addition to reports that he offered to pardon officials who carry out his immigration agenda.\n\n", "description": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi continues to publicly resist a formal impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Heather Caygle", "Kyle Cheney", "Andrew Desiderio"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/54/e2/22dd12d14afebdba0785e280df20/190324-jerry-nadler-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
