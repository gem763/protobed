Isn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?!\u201d\n\nYoo replied that he found it \u201castounding\u201d before offering his own bit of astounding speculation.\n\n\u201cYou know, some people might call that espionage,\u201d the former Bush administration official suggested.\n\nAfter floating the possibility that Vindman\u2014an Iraq War veteran with a Purple Heart\u2014was a Ukrainian spy, Yoo said he thought Vindman\u2019s upcoming testimony wasn\u2019t \u201cbreaking news\u201d because it didn\u2019t add \u201cany new facts\u201d since we can \u201call make our judgment\u201d on Trump\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cI think that is something the American people should decide rather than just the House,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is the next election.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
