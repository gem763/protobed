The crashes were caused by a faulty automated system, MCAS, that Boeing installed on the planes.\n\nLawmakers are expected to press Muilenburg and John Hamilton, chief engineer of Boeing's commercial airplane division, about MCAS, and how the plane was initially certified as safe to fly.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nBoeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is set to testify in front of Congress this week, exactly one year after the first crash involving the company's newest plane, the 737 Max.\n\nMuilenburg's appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday \u2014 first before the Senate Commerce Committee, followed by the House Transportation committee \u2014 will be his first public testimony since each of the two jets crashed in October 2018 and in March. Each flight crashed within minutes of taking off. A combined 346 people were killed.\n\nLawmakers are expected to pepper Muilenburg with questions about Boeing's design and certification of the jet, particularly an automated system, MCAS, that has been faulted for both crashes.\n\n\"There's going to be quite a bit of anger expressed at him,\" Rep. Rick Larsen, a Democrat from Washington, whose district includes numerous Boeing employees, said to The Wall Street Journal. \"It's going to be a long day\u2014probably longer for Boeing than it will be for the committee.\"\n\nOn Tuesday \u2014 the anniversary of the first crash, Lion Air flight 610 in Indonesia \u2014 Muilenburg and John Hamilton, the chief engineer in Boeing's commercial airplane division, will testify at a Senate hearing titled \"Aviation Safety and the Future of Boeing's 737 Max.\" Later in the day, representatives from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Joint Authorities Technical Review \u2014 an international panel which investigated the FAA's actions to certify the 737 Max \u2014 will also testify.\n\nOn Wednesday, Muilenburg and Hamilton will appear at a House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure hearing: \"The Boeing 737 MAX: Examining the Design, Development, and Marketing of the Aircraft.\"\n\nAbout 20 family members of victims from the second crash \u2014 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 \u2014 are expected to be in attendance. A representative for Clifford Law Offices, which is representing the families, said there are plans for them to meet with Muilenburg on Wednesday.\n\nThe hearings come as Boeing has faced increasing criticism for its design and process of certifying the jet. The FAA has also been criticized for lax oversight of the planemaker.\n\nRecent developments, including the release of internal messages suggesting Boeing may have known about issues with the automated system, as well as renewed scrutiny of a 2018 law granting plane makers more independence from the FAA when certifying new planes, are likely to be raised.\n\nIn his opening statement for Tuesday's testimony \u2014 released Monday afternoon by Boeing following reporting by Reuters \u2014 Muilenburg will acknowledge the automated system's roles in the crashes, and describe efforts to prevent future accidents when the plane is eventually recertified.\n\n\"We have developed robust software improvements that will, among other things, ensure MCAS cannot be activated based on signals from a single sensor, and cannot be activated repeatedly,\" the written testimony says. \"We are also making additional changes to the 737 MAX's flight control software to eliminate the possibility of even extremely unlikely risks that are unrelated to the accidents.\"\n\nYou can read the full testimony below.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since March, following the second of two fatal crashes in five months.\n\nPreliminary reports about the two crashes, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, indicated that the MCAS \u2014 the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System \u2014 erroneously engaged and forced the planes' noses to point down because of a problem with the design of the system's software. Pilots were unable to regain control of the aircraft.\n\nThe system could be activated by a single sensor reading \u2014 in both crashes, the sensors are thought to have failed, sending erroneous data to the flight computer and, without a redundant check in place, triggering the automated system.\n\nMCAS was designed to compensate for the 737 Max having larger engines than previous 737 generations. The larger engines could cause the plane's nose to tip upward, leading to a stall \u2014 in that situation, MCAS could automatically point the nose down to negate the effect of the engine size.\n\nBoeing is aiming to submit a proposed fix to the FAA and get the plane certified to fly again by the end of 2019. US airlines have pulled the jet from their schedules until at least January.", "description": "Lawmakers are expected to question Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg over the 737 Max crashes, including the role, design, and certification of MCAS.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5c90e3c44f07ae2b3646d739?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
