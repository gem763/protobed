Due to the limited number of products currently available we are opening a registration system. You have until 28th October to browse the shop and register your interest to buy a product. Please pick one item only, then enter your details and answer the question. Entrants will be selected at random and offered first refusal to make a purchase within 7 working days with a secure way to pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a proper shop \u2013 it is an actual shop,\u201d the website continues. \u201cit sells stuff and offers refunds and complies with data protection \u2013 but all the products are made in an art studio, not a factory. Everything is produced by a handful of people using recycled material wherever possible in a workplace culture of daytime drinking. So there isn\u2019t loads of it and it\u2019s not all ready to ship straight away. You are advised that GDP may prove to be a disappointing retail experience \u2013 especially if you\u2019re successful in making a purchase.\u201d", "description": "The stab vest worn by Stormzy during his headline set at Glastonbury Festival 2019 is among the items up for sale on Banksy\u2019s new online store.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/29/16/stormzy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
