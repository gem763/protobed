And you\u2019re still running,\u201d she also said, reportedly making a comparison between white flight and what immigrant families experience when they settle in US neighborhoods.\n\nAt the meeting, Michelle Obama reportedly touted the benefits of building the Obama Presidential Center on 19.3 acres in historic Jackson Park on Chicago\u2019s South Side.
