A report by security firm SafeBreach notes it reported the vulnerability in September.\n\nThe anomaly lets a hacker install a program into a service that is run by the \u201cNT AUTHORITYSYSTEM,\u201d \u2013 the admin account. When browser\u2018s service, a program essential to run the browser, MxService, running with admin privileges starts, it searches for a non-existent file called program.exe before it moves to other executables to fire up the actual browser app.\n\nUsing this bug, a hacker can place a dummy executable with that name, and the browser would think it\u2019s harmless. The research team said the cause of the exploit is in the install package.\n\nThrough this vulnerability, an attacker can gain admin privileges, install malicious code, and bypass windows security to run apps that might not get execution permission otherwise.\n\nSafeBreach said Maxthon for Windows version 5.1.0 to 5.2.7 are affected. Maxthon\u2019s website claims its browser is used by more than 670 million people, but it hasn\u2019t specified any number for its Windows users.\n\nThe browser hasn\u2019t specified any date for a patch, so you should avoid using it at the moment.\n\nRead next: Q4 digital report: Pinterest gains on Instagram and TikTok don\u2019t stop", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fimage-6.png&signature=0bececc68d9bf0bbb726cd7e5d1d7a29", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
