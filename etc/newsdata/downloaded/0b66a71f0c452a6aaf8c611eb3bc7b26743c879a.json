Intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads. Drones built for precision strikes. Tanks and armored personnel carriers bearing soldiers in green uniforms.\n\nThe occasion for the grand show of force on Tuesday in Tiananmen Square was the 70th anniversary of Communist rule in China \u2014 and it was Mr. Xi\u2019s second military parade in four years, something no party leader since Mao had attempted to stage.\n\nIn an era when China plays a dominant role on the global stage, officials, whether in Washington or Moscow or Hanoi, use such events to discern the foreign policy intentions of Mr. Xi and determine whether the economic juggernaut of China is a political and milit ary threat. And the festivities on Tuesday sent a clear message at a complicated time for China\u2019s diplomacy.\n\nWith the parade and policies like the militarization of the South China Sea, Mr. Xi and other Communist Party leaders want to tell the world: We are ready to fight and to seize or protect what we deem is ours. They want to show that China is not the same nation they say was humiliated by European powers and Japan from the 19th to 20th centuries.", "description": "Leaders in Beijing have declared their aims are peaceful, but developments in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet and elsewhere \u2014 as well as a military parade \u2014 indicate otherwise.", "authors": ["Edward Wong"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/world/02china-diplo-1/02china-diplo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
