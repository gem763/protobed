Neither should it deliver the \u201call-clear\u201d sign that the economy is immune to a global manufacturing slowdown and declining business investment, which suggests the Fed will keep the door open to a third rate cut later this fall following its September meeting.\n\nThe unemployment rate held steady at 3.7% in August. Employers added 130,000 jobs, though that included 25,000 temporary government hires for the coming census count. The share of Americans who had a job also rose.\n\nVideo\n\nFor the Fed and economic forecasters, it is a tale of two economies right now. The manufacturing sector, which is a small and shrinking share of U.S. output, has been contracting. It is especially exposed to the trade war and uncertainty about any potential escalation of trade hostilities because of how international supply chains have been built over a generation.\n\nThe much bigger services sector of the U.S. economy has been in better shape, underpinned by robust consumer spending. Evidence that hiring is slowing down to levels that would boost the unemployment rate would be a significant concern for the Fed because such a pullback would mean less income for consumers, threatening the economy\u2019s primary growth engine.\n\nA related worry is that trade policy uncertainty has already chilled business investment. If businesses look to cut their costs further, they could stop hiring workers or even lay them off.\n\nMarket-determined interest rates have been falling this summer, reflecting investors\u2019 concerns about long-term growth prospects. Fed officials have framed quarter-point rate cuts as a way to take out an insurance policy against a potentially deeper slowdown. They lowered their rate in July to a range between 2% and 2.25%.\n\nOne challenge for the Fed in reading the jobs numbers is that officials for years have expected that, as the current economic expansion matures, the rate of monthly hiring should slow. That is precisely what has been happening this year.\n\nFor example, the private sector has added 129,000 jobs per month over the past three months, on average. That is down from 236,000 jobs per month, on average, over the three months ended December.\n\nIf employers were running out of workers to hire, it is possible this would be reflected in rising wages. But wage growth hasn\u2019t accelerated significantly this year. Average hourly earnings were up 3.2% over the year ended August, down from a 3.4% increase in February.\n\nThe report also follows revisions to data on U.S. corporate profits and employment that have suggested the economy was on a slightly slower track last year than previously thought.\n\nA few indicators are receiving extra attention from economists, Fed officials, and others looking for any early alarms about a slowdown. Weekly hours worked have declined this year even though the unemployment rate has held steady and at historically low levels. Businesses tend to cut back workers\u2019 hours before cutting back on hiring entirely.\n\nAn index of aggregate weekly hours of private-sector nonsupervisory workers rose 0.8% from a year ago in August, down from a rise of 2.5% one year ago but up from a 0.7% increase in July.\n\nThe report showed continued evidence of a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, too. Overtime hours worked in that sector fell nearly 9% from a year ago, the largest such decline since 2015, when a large drop in oil prices led to cutbacks across the U.S. energy production sector.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak on the economic outlook at a moderated discussion in Zurich at 12:30 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nPresident Trump has been pressuring the Fed and Mr. Powell to cut interest rates more aggressively. Mr. Trump selected Mr. Powell to lead the central bank for a four-year term that began last year.\n\n\u201cThey were WAY too early to raise [rates], and Way too late to cut,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Friday morning, minutes before the release of the jobs report. \u201cWhere did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you can\u2019t win them all.\u201d\n\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com", "description": "The August jobs report is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point in two weeks to cushion the U.S. economy amid signs of slowing growth.", "authors": ["Nick Timiraos", "Nick.Timiraos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104638/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
