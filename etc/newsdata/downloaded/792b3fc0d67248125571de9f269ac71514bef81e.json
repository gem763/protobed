That stuck with us until that game when we got here (before this World Cup),\" the skipper said.\n\n\"It\u2019s something that we never want to go through again.\"\n\nKolisi was referring to the warm-up match the sides played ahead of the 2019 showpiece, with the Boks running out 41-7 winners there.\n\n\"But they are a much better team now, and it was good to play that game before the World Cup, just to get that monkey off our back,\" he said.\n\n\"Now it\u2019s a different game again. We are going to have to be at our best again, because they have really improved as a team - they are much better now than four years ago.\n\n\"So, we are looking forward to the challenge.\"\n\nKolisi was also informed that 1995 World Cup-winning captain Francois Pienaar would be in attendance at Tokyo Stadium on Sunday.\n\n\"Oh, I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019s here! It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m hearing that, and it is exciting and good to know,\" he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s awesome to have guys like that \u2013 John Smit (former South Africa captain) is also here to support.\n\n\"It really means a lot to us, as players, that guys who have done it before are supporting us and does boost the players.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 12:15 (SA time).", "description": "Siya Kolisi will lead the Springboks into battle against Japan on Sunday knowing what defeat to the Brave Blossoms feels like.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9491/1100fda93fe641c99259fa9e7bfe9304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
