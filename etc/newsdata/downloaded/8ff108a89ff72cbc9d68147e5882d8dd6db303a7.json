His commentary style is more futbal than American football.\n\nSince 2010, Moreno and his nephew Luis Moreno Jr, have been calling Carolina Panthers games.\n\nLuis is the Xs and Os guy. Jaime is the X-Factor guy. Together they are responsible for turning swathes of South America and the wider world into Panthers fans.\n\nJaime and Luis Moreno Jr have been calling Carolina Panthers games for the past nine seasons\n\nNon-Spanish speakers listen to their radio broadcasts, such is their appeal. Head coach Ron Rivera\u2019s parents tune in from Puerto Rico. Ahead of games, Rivera plays their calls to players to pump up the team.\n\nTheir clips reach three million hits in a little over a day. They dance, they sing, they are joyous, frequently funny and loud. Sometimes extremely so. And they celebrate everything. From the coin toss to a sack, it\u2019s all there. Jaime has been known to say the word \u2018touchdown\u2019 twenty times in jubilation.\n\nFour years ago, the duo went viral after Jaime\u2019s description of quarterback Cam Newton\u2019s front flip touchdown against the Houston Texans.\n\nTo translate: \u2019He\u2019s getting in!\u2019 Jaime bellows. \u2018You\u2019re flying like Superman, my dear dinosaur! Fly like you can, fly like you can! Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown! Dance, dance, dance my dear dinosaur! The Panthers add six more points to the score!\u2019\n\nAnd then there are the nicknames. Newton, who has a metatarsal injury and has not travelled to England, is El Dinosaurio (\u2018He\u2019s one of a kind. There are no more like him,\u2019 Jaime says).\n\nThere are many more. \u2018Christian McCaffrey has a nickname. I call him The Locomotor,\u2019 Jaime explains.\n\nChristian McCaffrey is in sensational form and is the best running-back in the NFL right now\n\n\u2018He carries the team. You put the team on his back, he\u2019s like a train. No matter how the game is going he always tries to keep pushing, pushing pushing. What he did on Sunday proves that at this particular moment he\u2019s the best running back in the league.\u2019\n\n'We call Luke Kuechly The Confessor,\u2019 Jaime continues. \u2018In medieval times, if you don\u2019t speak and you don\u2019t tell the truth they send you to the confessor. And he will put you in a room and he will tie you up and hit you so hard that you will come out with the truth. And that\u2019s Luke Kuechly on the field.\n\n\u2018If you try to pass where he\u2019s at, he\u2019s going to make you confess your sins. He\u2019s going to hit you so hard that you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s just recorded his 1,000th tackle, so that\u2019s a great asset for the team and a great accomplishment.\u2019\n\nAnd what of back-up quarterback Kyle Allen, whose record is played four, won four, including last season\u2019s week 17 win against the New Orleans Saints?\n\n\u2018He is The Galactico. He is from another galaxy. He came out of nowhere,\u2019 Jaime says.\n\n\u2018OK. He was always from the darkest part of the locker room. Nobody even talked to him, nobody said anything to him. Last year he came, we played in New Orleans at the Mercedes-Benz Dome and he came that week Ron Rivera made the decision. Allen went there and he did very good.\n\n\u2018And then when Cam is hurt and Allen came aboard he started doing his homework. The most important thing to do is manage the game. One of the things I noticed, personally, when he\u2019s been on the field, we have never been penalised for delay of game.\n\n'He knows where he\u2019s at, he knows where the clock is running he when to make a call. He knows when to stop the clock. It is something that he adds into the game but it\u2019s still something Cam Newton needs to develop.\u2019\n\nIn the absence of starting quarterback Cam Newton, Kyle Allen has stepped up to the plate\n\nJaime played American football at college in his native Mexico and moved to Carolina in 1989. He was obsessed with the NFL but his passion was often met with blank stares from his soccer-loving compatriots.\n\nHe started a radio show and invited Luis - another former player in Mexico - on to break down plays. After commentating on video games together, the pair had a certain shtick, but it wasn\u2019t until a meeting with Panthers broadcast coordinator in 2009 that their dream became a reality.\n\nBack then they pointed to the success of the Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Spanish broadcasts.\n\nThe Panthers took a punt on the pair, and nowadays 16 NFL teams provide Spanish commentary.\n\nNone are more popular than the Morenos, who have had highs and lows at Carolina, who went 2-14 in their first year.\n\nThe 2015 season was a seesaw ride, with Carolina going 15-1 on their way to Super Bowl 50. The game ended in a punishing 24-10 defeat by the Denver Broncos.\n\nNewton fell at the final hurdle, losing Super Bowl 50 to Peyton Manning's Denver Broncos\n\n\u2018Going back to the hotel. We were on the bus. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody was talking, If you drop a piece of paper on the bus, I think you would feel when the piece of paper hit the floor,\u2019 Jaime says.\n\n\u2018It was a game that we planned to win and the team was completely ready to do it. But sometimes these things happen.\n\n\u2018Denver were very experienced. That day Mike Tolbert had never dropped a pass - he dropped a pass. He always converts first downs. This day, he couldn\u2019t do it.\n\n\u2018Those are the things that didn\u2019t click at the Super Bowl. I always say to win a Super Bowl you don\u2019t have to play to win. You have to be ready to pass over the team that you are playing against.\n\n\u2018This time this team was Denver. They controlled the momentum, they controlled the clock. Even though we dominated the game. Having the quarterback they had, it really made a big difference.\n\nLinebacker Luke Kuechly is referred to as 'The Confessor' by the Morenos in their commentary\n\n\u2018You know what I think, I think the Panthers will be back to the Super Bowl pretty soon. With this team we have I think the Panthers will be fighting for a Super Bowl pretty soon.\u2019\n\nThe Panthers play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in an NFC South battle at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Sunday. They are 3-2, buoyed by a feisty 34-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, their third in a row.\n\n\u2018Man, it was wonderful. It was not just a win. I think the way that they win is what counts a lot. Even thought the team make a lot of mistakes, the team as a whole was able to come out with a win.\n\n'The most important thing was it wads the first win at home in the season. On top of that we hadn\u2019t won at home for ten months. It was meaningful for the team and for the fans too,\u2019 Jaime claims.\n\nJaime emphasised the need to put on a show for the viewers, not just simply call play-by-play\n\nAsked to describe his style, Jaime says: \u2018Listen. Walk away from the box. Don\u2019t be a regular commentator who just calls the game. You have to have a show. Where people can laugh. When you\u2019re laughing, they\u2019re laughing. When you\u2019re singing, they sing.\n\n\u2018If I go there and just call the game the way it is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing my job. I have go there and really entertain. Not just the fans. Myself - and I tell you - the players.\n\n'Because Ron Rivera will play these quotes to the players so they listen to it on Saturday and they just laugh. They are funny moments for them.\u2019\n\nThe Morenos will be calling Sunday\u2019s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from their booth at Bank of America Stadium.
