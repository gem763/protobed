Your dedication to helping animals is far beyond the commitment to this tattoo.\"\n\n\"Love you, Moby!\" said tattoo artist and fellow vegan Kat Von D, whose makeup brand is 100 percent cruelty-free.\n\nVEGAN FAMILY CLAIMS THEY HAVE 'LOST FRIENDS,' GET 'BULLIED' OVER LIFESTYLE\n\nPeople online were supportive, if not a little surprised, at the bold ink statement.\n\n\"Wow,\" one user commented. Singer-songwriter Julie Mintz said, \"I\u2019m starting to accept that it\u2019s real!\"\n\nOthers said the tattoo was \"dope\" and \"incredible.\"\n\nMoby was criticized earlier this year after making some claims in his new memoir, \"Then It Fell Apart,\" about Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman. The musician said Portman was \"flirting\" with him in his dressing room and that he had tried to pursue dating her in the early 2000s.\n\nThe \"Black Swan\" star shut down the dating claims and said she found Moby \"creepy\" back then.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to hear that he characterized the very short time that I knew him as dating because my recollection is a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school,\u201d Portman told Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK at the time. \"That he used this story to sell his book was very disturbing to me\"\n\nWhile the singer initially claimed Portman was lying, he later walked back his comments and apologized.\n\nMOBY APOLOGIZES TO NATALIE PORTMAN AFTER CLAIMING THEY DATED IN NEW MEMOIR\n\n\"As some time has passed I\u2019ve realized that many of the criticisms leveled at me regarding my inclusion of Natalie in Then It Fell Apart are very valid,\" he said. \"I also fully recognize that it was truly inconsiderate of me to not let her know about her inclusion in the book beforehand, and equally inconsiderate for me to not fully respect her reaction.\"\n\nMoby later canceled the rest of his U.K. book tour in May and said he was \"going away for a while.\"\n\n\u201cBut before I do I want to apologize again, and to say clearly that all of this has been my own fault,\u201d Moby said. \u201cI am the one who released the book without showing it to the people I wrote about. I\u2019m the one who posted defensively and arrogantly. I\u2019m the one who behaved inconsiderately and disrespectfully, both in 2019 and in 1999.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Ann W.
