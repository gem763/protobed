Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) called Flynn\u2019s effort to comply with lawmakers\u2019 requests \u201cplainly insufficient\u201d and accused his lawyers of exhibiting \u201ca troubling degree of unprofessionalism\u201d in how they had approached negotiations with the committee.\n\n[Michael Flynn asks judge to find Mueller prosecutors in contempt for \u2018malevolent conduct\u2019]\n\nAccording to Schiff, Flynn\u2019s attorney Sidney Powell refused for a week to \u201caccept service\u201d of the panel\u2019s initial subpoena seeking Flynn\u2019s testimony. Schiff also complained that Flynn\u2019s lawyers attempted to direct the committee to collect subpoenaed documents from other congressional panels or the Justice Department, on grounds the requirements were too taxing.\n\nThe panel demanded Flynn turn over all subpoenaed documents and materials by Sept. 18 and appear for testimony the morning of Sept. 25.\n\nPowell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n[Michael Flynn\u2019s transformation from storied Army officer to purveyor of conspiracy theories]\n\nFlynn is one of several figures close to Trump who has caught the attention of congressional investigators examining their interactions with Russian officials.\n\nThe retired three-star general, who served in Trump\u2019s administration and on his transition team, pleaded guilty in late 2017 to lying to federal investigators about his contacts with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and cooperated with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Flynn has yet to be sentenced after several delays, initially due to Flynn\u2019s continued cooperation with prosecutors and later due to clashes between prosecutors and Flynn\u2019s new legal team.\n\nSchiff accused those lawyers of occasionally refusing to speak with panel staffers and attempting to assert an overly broad claim to Fifth Amendment protections.\n\n\u201cIf you intend to assert your Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, your counsel must engage with the Committee Staff to discuss the potential subjects of your testimony so that the Committee may determine whether you have a good faith basis to assert your Fifth Amendment right,\u201d Schiff wrote. \u201cUntil that occurs, you remain obligated to appear in person and testify before the Committee.\u201d", "description": "House Intelligence chairman threatens to enforce a subpoena against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser unless he complies with demands for documents and testimony.", "authors": ["Karoun Demirjian", "Congressional Reporter Focusing On National Security", "September At Pm", "Karoun Demirjian Is A Congressional Reporter Covering National Security", "Including Defense", "Foreign Policy", "Intelligence", "Matters Concerning The Judiciary.
