But that is exactly what the Democrats want to do. They are willing to hurt the Country, with only the 2020 Election in mind!\u201d\n\nInvestors have been paying attention to the impeachment effort against Trump, but the catalyst for Tuesday\u2019s slide appeared to be data showing slower job creation and increased concerns about economic growth linked to Trump\u2019s trade war with China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.86% dropped 494 points, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.79% fell 52 points and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.56% skidded 123 points. Read Market Snapshot.\n\nAsked during a news conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 if he\u2019d cooperate with Democrats\u2019 planned subpoena of documents, Trump said \u201cI always cooperate\u201d and that \u201cwe\u2019ll work together\u201d with Schiff and Pelosi. Trump has previously said he would fight all subpoenas issued by Democrats investigating his administration. And to date, the White House hasn\u2019t turned over documents sought by House committees.\n\nHouse committees plan to issue a subpoena Friday to force the White House to turn over records related to phone calls between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, the Wall Street Journal reported. Trump\u2019s effort to enlist Ukraine to probe Joe Biden and his son is at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nTrump also told reporters Schiff should \u201cresign from office in disgrace,\u201d and reiterated that the congressman should be investigated for treason over his depiction of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian leader. Schiff has said the remarks in question were meant partly in parody. He\u2019d said he was editing out \u201cthe rambling character\u201d and using fewer words than were in the call transcript.\n\nTIMES STORY\n\nAlso Wednesday, Trump addressed a New York Times report that he suggested shooting migrants in the legs as they tried to enter the U.S. and that he sought an alligator-filled moat at the border with Mexico. He didn\u2019t mention the shooting of migrants in his tweet but said about the moat, \u201cI may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough.\u201d He told reporters during an Oval Office appearance with Niinist\u00f6 that \u201cmoat\u201d is not a word he uses, and mistakenly attributed the story to the Washington Post. (In a tweet, he used the word \u201cMoot\u201d for moat.)\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday blamed Democrats\u2019 push for his impeachment for stock-market losses, even as he said he\u2019d cooperate with House Speaker...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS498_trump__ZG_20191002122755.jpg"}
