A broad measure of corporate earnings\u2014after taxes, without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments\u2014rose 4.8% from the prior quarter. That came after corporate profits, which are often volatile on a quarterly basis, dropped 1.5% in both the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nLooking over a longer period, they were up a more muted 1.7% in the second quarter from the same period a year before.\n\nAmerican companies faced earnings pressure earlier in the year for a number of reasons, including rising labor costs, limited pricing power and a strong dollar that makes U.S. exports more expensive.\n\n\u201cWhatever the numbers show for any individual quarter, we have to expect a weaker trend in corporate earnings growth in the next year,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nAnalysts noted that the level of U.S. corporate profits has barely changed over the past five years.\n\n\u201cFor every dollar they sell, [companies] are not getting a lot back,\u201d said Joseph Carson, a former chief economist at Alliance Bernstein who is now an independent consultant. \u201cConsumer spending is strong but remember it\u2019s the companies that pay their salaries and offer them jobs.\u201d\n\nThe concern among economists is that future weakness in profits at American companies could spell trouble for the labor market if boardrooms slow hiring or even lay off workers to cut costs.\n\nWeakness in inventory investment and trade exerted bigger drags on growth in the April-through-June period than previously thought, causing the Commerce Department to lower slightly its estimate of total second-quarter GDP growth to a 2.0% annual rate from the 2.1% pace previously estimated.\n\nA closely watched gauge of business investment declined in the second quarter for the first time since early 2016. Nonresidential fixed investment\u2014which reflects spending on software, research and development, equipment and structures\u2014fell at a 0.6% rate.\n\nStill, consumers\u2019 spending drives about two-thirds of U.S. economic output, and an improving labor market has helped them provide continued fuel for economic growth.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What do you think of the current state of the U.S. economy? Join the conversation below.\n\nU.S. households boosted spending at a 4.7% annual rate in the second quarter, the strongest pace since late 2014, shrugging off the uncertainty over trade policy and tariffs that rattled financial markets. That was stronger than the previously estimated 4.3% pace.\n\nConsumers have continued to spend briskly since the second quarter, according to other recent data.\n\nWhile consumer sentiment declined in August, according to separate readings from the Conference Board and the University of Michigan, the indexes still remain at a historically high level.\n\nTarget Corp. and Walmart Inc. were among the beneficiaries of strong consumer spending in recent months. Both retailers recently raised full-year earnings guidance and reported higher second-quarter sales.\n\nStill, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell warned during an earnings call last week that \u201cas long as the trade situation remains fluid, it will present an additional layer of uncertainty and complexity as we plan our business.\u201d\n\nBloomfield Hills, Mich.-based adjustable bed manufacturer Reverie said it held off on a planned expansion of a location in Buffalo, N.Y. in the second quarter due to tariff uncertainty.\n\n\u201cOriginally the domestic manufacturing was fairly competitive\u2014with the steel price increases and the component tariffs it\u2019s kind of blown that up a little,\u201d said CEO Martin Rawls-Meehan. The company has shifted some production to Vietnam and Taiwan \u201csimply because that\u2019s the only way we can compete,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company, which has about 150 employees, cut some manufacturing jobs in the second quarter, although it boosted head count in other areas such as sales and operations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing well and we\u2019re growing,\u201d the CEO said, adding that \u201coverall we\u2019ve actually added some jobs, but we\u2019re not going to add nearly as many as we planned to on the manufacturing side.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve officials are likely to lower short-term interest rates at their meeting Sept. 17-18 to cushion the U.S. economy against the risks from slowing global growth and rising trade uncertainty. They cut rates in July for the first time since 2008.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, speaking last week in Jackson Hole, Wyo., cautioned that the Fed\u2019s tools weren\u2019t well suited to counter rising business and investor anxieties over the intensifying trade war.\n\nThe manufacturing sector has continued to struggle in the third quarter so far, with U.S. factory output falling in July from a month earlier, the Fed reported.\n\nForecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers on Thursday projected GDP would rise at a 2.2% pace in the third quarter, now in its ninth week. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s GDPNow model most recently predicted a 2.3% growth rate.\n\nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "description": "The U.S. economic expansion cooled as it reached its 10th anniversary, despite strong pickups in corporate profits and consumer spending in the second quarter, with longer-run forces weighing on the outlook ahead.", "authors": ["Harriet Torry"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-101404/social"}
