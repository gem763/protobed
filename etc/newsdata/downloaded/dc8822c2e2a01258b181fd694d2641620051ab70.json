The new rubber was meant to last him the remainder of the race. But they did not and he came in a second time, plunging him from first to third place.\n\nBottas, on a more clinical two-stop strategy by design, swept to his third win of the season.\n\nHamilton questioned his strategy straight after his first stop.\n\nHis race engineer Peter Bonnington told him: \u2018So you\u2019re currently P3. Vettel 10 seconds ahead. Deg looks very high, so one stop will be a struggle. Let\u2019s chase Vettel down.\u2019\n\nBottas controlled the race from start to finish to take an easy win for Mercedes following another error strewn day from Ferrari\n\nFerrari drivers Vettel and Charles Leclerc share a discussion post race following another poor display from the team\n\nVettel reflects on what could have been after his near false start played a big part in Ferrari losing the race\n\nVettel hesitated on the line and it allowed Bottas to easily pass him on the run down into the first corner\n\nVettel managed to hold onto second place but came under fire from Leclerc, Hamilton (left) and Max Verstappen (right)\n\nVerstappen's storming start for Red Bull saw him make a pass around the outside of Leclerc into turn one\n\nBut Verstappen tangled with Leclerc who appeared to barge the Dutchman off the race circuit as fans look on from the stands\n\nVerstappen dropped down to 17th as a result but he picked up too much damage from the incident and retired soon after\n\nJAPANESE GRAND PRIX RESULT AND STANDINGS RACE RESULT 1 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1hr 21mins 46.755secs 2 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:22:00.098 3 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes 1:22:00.613 4 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 1:22:46.292 5 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 1:22:55.856 6 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari at 1 lap 7 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault at 1 lap 8 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Toro Rosso at 1 lap 9 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point at 1 lap 10 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault at 1 lap 11 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point at 1 lap 12 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Toro Rosso at 1 lap 13 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren at 1 lap 14 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo at 1 lap 15 Romain Grosjean (Fra) Haas at 1 lap 16 Antonio Giovinazzi (Ita) Alfa Romeo at 1 lap 17 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas at 1 lap 18 George Russell (Gbr) Williams at 2 laps 19 Robert Kubica (Pol) Williams at 2 laps Not Classified: 20 Max Verstappen (Hol) Red Bull 14 laps completed Fastest Lap: Lewis Hamilton 1min 30.983secs on Lap 45 DRIVERS STANDINGS 1 Lewis Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes 338pts 2 Valtteri Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 274 3 Charles Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 223 4 Max Verstappen (Hol) Red Bull 212 5 Sebastian Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 212 6 Carlos Sainz (Spa) McLaren 76 7 Pierre Gasly (Fra) Toro Rosso 73 8 Alexander Albon (Tha) Red Bull 64 9 Daniel Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 40 10 Nico Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 35 11 Sergio Perez (Mex) Racing Point 33 12 Lando Norris (Gbr) McLaren 35 13 Daniil Kvyat (Rus) Toro Rosso 33 14 Kimi Raikkonen (Fin) Alfa Romeo 31 15 Kevin Magnussen (Den) Haas 20 16 Lance Stroll (Can) Racing Point 19 17.

And we lost time behind Vettel.\u2019\n\nLH: \u2018I\u2019m out of the race now. If deg is that massive why didn\u2019t you give me hard tyres? Can you guys explain a bit please. I\u2019m basically out of the race with a pitstop behind.\u2019\n\nLeclerc collected a broken endplate on his front wing, forcing him into an early pit-stop and ruining his race\n\nVettel managed to hold onto second despite late pressure from Hamilton but it was not enough to deny Mercedes the titles\n\nPB: \u2018So Vettel is guaranteed a two-stop, so we can see how this comes to us.\u2019\n\nIt didn\u2019t. Hamilton was in again on lap 42. He tried to hunt down Vettel and was all over the German in the closing stages but he couldn\u2019t quite blast past.\n\nIt was a three-car fight after Charle Leclerc pranged his Ferrari into Max Verstappen on the first lap. Leclerc finished sixth but Verstappen retired.\n\nHamilton, who set the fastest lap, now needs to score 14 points more than Bottas in Mexico City in a fortnight. Otherwise, it goes down to the US, with Brazil and Abu Dhabi after that.\n\nLondon-born Thai Alex Albon was fourth for Red Bull, his best finish.\n\nIn the sole remaining Red Bull Alex Albon took a career high fourth place as he tackles the S-curves early in the lap\n\nMcLaren also enjoyed a strong afternoon with Carlos Sainz who took fifth place for the Woking based outfit\n\nBy contrast, British team-mate Lando Norris endured a torrid afternoon and ended up finishing 13th\n\nDrivers tackle the uphill hairpin at the start of the race at Suzuka which was bathed in sunshine following the typhoon", "description": "JONATHAN McEVOY AT SUZUKA: Lewis Hamilton was denied victory at the Japanese Grand Prix that survived the typhoon by a rare mistake by all-conquering Mercedes.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For Mailonine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/08/19647754-0-image-a-27_1570951703190.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
