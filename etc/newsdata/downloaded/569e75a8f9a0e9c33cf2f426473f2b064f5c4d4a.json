Yet while female footballers have long craved recognition, it does have its drawbacks.\n\nOne of the OranjeLeeuwinnen\u2019s key figures, Jackie Groenen, is the star recruit for Manchester United Women, newly-promoted to the Barclays Women\u2019s Super League. Settling into Mancunian life via a Salford hotel she has been enjoying a quiet anonymity no longer possible in her homeland.\n\n\u201cIt has been incredible over the last couple of years, a lot of things have changed, especially in Holland,\u201d says the effervescent midfielder. \u201cI still can\u2019t get used to the fact that I can\u2019t just go grocery shopping anymore.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cThings at home have been quite crazy. When I am back at home and have a couple of days off I want to do everything with them so my mum is going grocery shopping and I am like, \u2018oh cool I\u2019ll go with you\u2019, and she is like: \u2018No, stay home!\u2019 Ever since the Euros it has been exploding.\u201d\n\nSuccessive semi-finals in the Euros and World Cup for England\u2019s Lionesses has primed the game in this country for a similar boom, but it is yet to fully ignite. The fuse will burn a little more fiercely this weekend as the WSL makes a high-profile return with the first Manchester derby of the professional era. It will be staged at the Etihad tomorrow, with more than 20,000 tickets already sold. United are hoping to spoil City\u2019s party.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is a big new adventure for me and the club so it is nice to start it off with a massive game.\n\n\u201cIt is good to see women\u2019s football is getting that big it is played at men\u2019s stadiums and I hope that will continue. We have experienced playing in big stadiums with Holland [national team] for a while now and every time I am in the stadium\u2026it is the nice thing about being a women\u2019s footballer at this time because you kind of know where you came from. I remember playing in front of 10 people and now when I go to Holland we play in front of 40,000 and it is nice to still realise that that is not a normal thing.\u201d\n\nThis is Groenen\u2019s second crack at English football. Now 24 she had a spell at Chelsea when 19 but left after 16 moderate months. She feels she, and the WSL, are now better suited to each other.\n\n\u201cI think the league has changed massively,\u201d she said. \u201cBack in the days when I was at Chelsea in midfield I felt like the ball was just going over me, flying up and down and I was just standing there. I feel like that has changed a lot, the level has gone up quite a bit.\n\n\u201cI am a bit more experienced now [too]. It was the first time for me to leave home \u2013 I had been playing in Germany before but still living at my parent\u2019s house. I feel like I have grown as a person and as a player, maybe I am a bit calmer than I was before. I love the English pace, it is very attacking-minded, so most of the time I am just trying to calm things down, telling everyone to calm down while they are flooding past me.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to trying to get a grip on things in midfield Groenen does have one unusual advantage. As a teenager she was a Dutch judo champion and won European bronze at U17 level when 15. She continued as a judoka until she broke her hip competing at 17.\n\nMSV Duisburg, for whom she was playing, put a stop to her judo but Groenen, a slender 5ft 5in, feels the martial art significantly helped her football.\n\n\u201cLooking back [doing judo] is one of the best decisions I have ever made,\u201d she said. \u201cFor my style of play it has been massive. When I talk to young girls, or when people ask me for advice, the first thing I always say is to take judo lessons with playing football. Ajax in Holland do it with the youth players. It is not only about strength, it is about using your body in the right way. I feel like I can tell when I have to step in or when I can put people off balance without really using force. I still miss it sometimes.\u201d\n\nThat background meant Groenen felt confident when, as one of head coach Casey Stoney\u2019s bonding events, the Manchester United players went sumo wrestling.\n\n\u201cBefore we started I was bragging. I was like \u2018guys, I\u2019ve got this, I am going to win this\u2019, and it was the first round and I was out! They make you put on this suit and it was massive and it is very heavy. I am a very lightweight person and I was on the ground and I couldn\u2019t get up.\u201d\n\nGroenen, a tidy passer who knits play together, can expect to be far more successful helping United find their feet in the WSL. Attracted both by the Manchester United name, and by the challenge of helping a young club establish itself, she may even find herself being recognised in English supermarket aisles by the season\u2019s end.", "description": "When the Dutch hosted and won Women\u2019s Euro 2017 the players became household names, a fame further cemented by reaching this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup final.
