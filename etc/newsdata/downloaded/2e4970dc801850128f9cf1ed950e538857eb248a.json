I think it shouldn\u2019t be legalised because it can lead to many diseases such as cancer, chronic pain, or worse. To avoid such problems, I don\u2019t think anyone should be allowed to use cannabis, unless they need it to treat an illness. Stay away from people who take drugs, and take care of your health.\n\nSadak Meehan Ahmed Sultan, 12, HKMA David Li Kwok Po College\n\nI don\u2019t think it should be legalised in Hong Kong. Cannabis can make you feel sleepy, and can also affect your memory. If it is used consistently over a long period of time, it can cause some serious damage to your heart and lungs. Non-medical cannabis is bad for our health and should therefore remain illegal.\n\nChan Pui Kwan, 12, Pope Paul VI College\n\nTeen drug use in Hong Kong is \u2018on the rise\u2019, according to survey\n\nNo. People who support the legalisation of cannabis argue that some people need the drug for medical reasons, such as to treat epilepsy. However, I think cannabis does more harm than good to young people. If the drug is legalised, youths may think cannabis is not so harmful to them. If they were interested, they could easily try it out, but the problem is it\u2019s easy to get hooked. Some young people believe smoking cannabis can help them escape their problems without considering the long-term detrimental effects on their health. Young people are vulnerable to the harmful effects of drugs. To protect the pillars of our future society, the government should not legalise cannabis in Hong Kong.\n\nJody Ho, 16, Queen Elizabeth School\n\nI have to say no. Right now, cannabis is illegal in Hong Kong, but there are still many people and adults who using the drug. Imagine how many people would be using cannabis if it were legal! I think it would definitely lead to more people taking the drug. This is why I think it should remain illegal.\n\nWarwick Lai, 16, Fung Kai Liu Man Shek Tong Secondary School\n\nI think it should for the following reasons: even though cannabis can be very harmful to your health when abused, it\u2019s also a very useful medicine. If used responsibly, it can treat a lot of illnesses such as cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and epilepsy. I think as long as citizens don\u2019t abuse the drug and are careful not to get addicted, I think legalising it would be fine.\n\nHazel Fung, 12, Pope Paul VI College\n\nIs Hong Kong doing enough to tackle its underage drinking problem?\n\nI think cannabis should be made legal in Hong Kong because many people could use the drug for medical treatment. The problem is cannabis is addictive and people need to be wary of this when they use it. If the drug is legalised, it hope it would benefit a lot of people with diseases that can be treated with medical cannabis.\n\nOorvi Goyal, 12, HKMA David Li Kwok Po College\n\nI don\u2019t think it should. Cannabis, like a lot of other drugs, cannabis is hazardous to our health. It can also be very expensive if we become addicted to it. A lot of people say they feel more relaxed when they use the drug, but I think it does more harm than good. If we keep using it, that could seriously affect our mental and physical health. You should do more exercise to relax instead.\n\nWong Wing-gi, 14, STFA Leung Kau Kui College\n\nAbsolutely not. As we know, cannabis is a drug and it is not good for our health. Although it is said to give people a certain amount of joy when they are under stress or feeling sad, it can be very harmful to their mental health. The most terrible thing is that people easily become addicted to the drug. I think that if cannabis was legalised in Hong Kong, the city would no longer be a nice place.\n\nCarol Chen,12, Pope Paul VI College\n\nTeens and young adults who vape are 3.5 times more likely to use marijuana, study finds\n\nCannabis should be legalised for medical purposes in Hong Kong, but not for recreational purposes. Many Hongkongers might need the drug to relieve their stress from social issues such as the high cost of living.\n\nShirley Hon, 17, Fung Kai No. 1 Secondary School\n\nI strongly suggest that we don\u2019t legalise cannabis in Hong Kong. As we know, cannabis has a great deal of short-term and long-term side effects, including a weakened immune system, depression, loss of focus, and so on. It is likely to have a negative impact on a person\u2019s everyday life.\n\nJoey Chan Ka-wai, 18, Hong Kong Weaving Mills Association Chu Shek Lun Secondary School\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda\n\nIn our next Talking Points, we\u2019ll discuss:\n\nShould junk food come with health warnings?\n\nWe are now accepting your answers for this topic.
