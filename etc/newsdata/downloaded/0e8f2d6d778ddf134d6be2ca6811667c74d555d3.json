One vet, Li Daibing, told Hongxing News that he urged people not to dye their pets, saying: \"This could damage their fur and skin.\"\n\nImage copyright VCG Image caption Chengdu has become a popular tourist site for seeing the vulnerable species, and national Chinese treasure: the giant panda.\n\n'Has become normal'\n\nDyeing pets became a full-blown craze in China in the early 2010s, first for competitions, but then amidst a domestic wave of \"extreme dog pampering\".\n\nSince, however, there has been a growing consciousness in China about animal ethics and testing. Many of the thousands of social media users commenting on the popular Sina Weibo microblog have voiced their concern about such treatments being used on animals.\n\nMany call the idea \"crazy\" and note that hair dye can \"damage people's hair and scalp\", so could similarly affect a dog.\n\nBut others argue that \"it's really cute\", and say that they perceive animal dyeing \"has become normal\".\n\nIt's not just China either - earlier this year, the Latitude Festival in Suffolk was criticised by the RSPCA after a flock of sheep were dyed pink.\n\nReporting by Kerry Allen\n\nNext story: Turkmen banks ordered to fund leader's pet project\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.", "description": "An animal cafe has opened in Chengdu that lets people play with \"pandas\" that are actually dogs.", "authors": ["News Elsewhere...", "...As Found Bbc Monitoring"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/143AE/production/_109326828_panda.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
