Hong Kong\u2019s leader defended the city\u2019s police force, questioning \u201cpuzzling\u201d demands by anti-government protesters for its disbandment and saying the protesters would still have to seek its help in times of trouble.\n\nShe insisted that while the government had the responsibility to restore order and bring about reconciliation, Hongkongers would also have to support the police and say \u201cno\u201d to lawlessness.\n\nLam spent an hour on the Facebook live session, responding to internet users\u2019 comments on her governance and her latest policy address.\n\n\n\nThe chief executive touched on various areas, including housing, land supply, health care, education and security, using social media for the first time since August last year to engage the public.\n\nShe was forced to unveil her policy blueprint on Wednesday by way of an unprecedented, pre-recorded video as opposition lawmakers blocked her from presenting it live in the Legislative Council.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Lam also faced a barrage of insults from opposition politicians for the second consecutive day, and 13 pan-democratic lawmakers were thrown out the chamber for disorderly conduct.\n\nCarrie Lam heckled during policy address at Legco\n\nAt its peak, more than 7,600 concurrent users were watching the live session. When it ended at 9pm, more than 11,600 users had reacted \u2013 9,000 posted \u201cangry-face\u201d emojis, 2,000 \u201cliked\u201d what she had to say, and 600 expressed \u201clove\u201d.\n\nThe session racked up 49,000 comments, many of which reiterated the protesters\u2019 favourite slogan: \u201cFive demands, not one less!\u201d\n\nWhile Lam insisted that she could not back down on those demands, including the setting up of an independent inquiry into police conduct against protesters and amnesty for all those arrested so far, she made it a point to address a sixth demand \u2013 the disbandment of the police force.\n\nCarrie Lam insisted that it wasn't reasonable to disband the police force, as Hongkongers will need their help in other times of need.

But she offered no political solutions to restore order in a city rocked by more than four months of protest chaos.\n\nCivil Human Rights Front leader Jimmy Sham in stable condition after attack\n\n\u201cI also hope that Hong Kong can soon move on from this crisis \u2026 but we need everyone\u2019s effort. If we show sympathy to violence, attackers will only act without hesitation,\u201d Lam said when asked if Hong Kong would return to normal in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cThe biggest responsibility is on the government, because we have the ability to enforce the law, prosecute and reconcile. If there are better ways to work on these aspects, I\u2019m willing to take up the mission.\u201d\n\nThere were chaotic scenes earlier in Legco when the chief executive arrived for the traditional question and answer session on her policy address.\n\nOnly three pro-establishment lawmakers were able to ask questions because of frequent interruptions by pan-democratic legislators, more than a dozen of whom were kicked out of the chamber.\n\n\n\nPeople Power lawmaker Raymond Chan Chi-chuen was removed after he chanted: \u201cHong Kong Hitler! No one will call you Carrie any more! Blood all over your hands!\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a so-called citizens\u2019 press conference on Thursday, two masked protesters said the policy address showed Lam had diagnosed the city\u2019s situation wrongly.", "description": "The Chief Executive reached out via social media for the first time in more than a year and insisted that demonstrators' demands are not reasonable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/4910897e-f0d6-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires073920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
