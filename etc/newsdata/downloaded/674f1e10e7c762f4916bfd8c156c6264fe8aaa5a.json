It is much cheaper to rent with someone or multiple people than live alone,' he told the publication.\n\nCar pooling to work, using public transport, downloading fuel apps to find the cheapest petrol, keeping your tyres pumped up (the lower they are the more petrol your car uses) and buying a second-hand car can all help.\n\nDON'T BUY ITEMS JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE ON SALE\n\nPeople love the feeling of purchasing something 'on sale' but there is no point going through with the discount unless you actually need the item.\n\nWhile getting that $500 designer dress for $250 might seem like a good deal, you're still spending a few hundred dollars of your precious funds on one piece of clothing.\n\nThere is also no way of knowing that the dress was even meant to be priced at $500 - or whether it was just increased to create a 'sale' - so it's best to do your research first.\n\nThe top ten cheapest places to buy a home in Australia: 1.
