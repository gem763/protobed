(Alex Sanz/AP)\n\nHolding the Group of Seven meeting in June in Miami \u2014 where streets flood on sunny days from rising seas, and stifling heat and humidity are worsening \u2014 seems to present an opportune time to discuss climate change. However, in announcing the choice of President Trump\u2019s Miami-area Doral resort as the summit site, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters Thursday that climate change isn\u2019t a priority for the meeting.\n\n\u201cClimate change will not be on the agenda,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\n[Trump has awarded next year\u2019s G-7 summit of world leaders to his Miami-area resort, the White House said]\n\nTrump\u2019s decision not to raise the topic is not surprising, considering his intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a treaty the rest of the G-7 leaders are committed to. It\u2019s also in keeping with his treatment of climate change at other G-7 meetings and during international forums throughout his presidency. In August, for example, he skipped the climate session at the G-7 meeting in France, and he spent 14 minutes at a day-long U.N. climate summit in September, though that was 14 minutes more than was scheduled.\n\nTrump and his advisers have been annoyed at previous G-7 sessions when climate change has been on the agenda, and the president has said he does not want to attend such sessions, according to advisers who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president\u2019s private comments. White House officials described being frustrated that a \u201cniche\u201d issue played such a large role within the G-7. The president has sought to put more emphasis on economic and trade issues, in particular.\n\nThe question of how to address climate in international meetings \u2014 including those of the Group of 20 and Arctic Council, in addition to the G-7 \u2014 has become a thorny issue for other leaders. Earlier this year, according to a senior diplomat for a foreign country who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal private discussions, European leaders decided not to push for a joint communique on climate during these gatherings to avoid a public split with the United States.\n\nBut the question of climate has continued to surface when world leaders gather, underscoring the chasm between Trump and his counterparts from other industrialized nations.\n\nTrump has consistently questioned the overwhelming scientific consensus that human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global temperatures to increase, ice caps to melt, sea levels to rise, and extreme weather events such as heat waves to become more severe and frequent.\n\nAt this year\u2019s G-7 summit, he said he would not jeopardize economic progress in the United States when he was asked about climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose that wealth on dreams, on windmills,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems that a lot of people like myself \u2014 we have very high levels of intelligence, but we\u2019re not necessarily such believers,\u201d he told The Washington Post in an interview last year.\n\nIn private, he is openly derisive of climate change \u2014 and even encouraged former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to go on television and make the argument against it, advisers said. \u201cIt was one of their main bonding issues,\u201d said a former EPA official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhite House officials want to make next year\u2019s G-7 about the U.S. economy, hoping to use it as a strong political argument for the president\u2019s policies in an election year.\n\nHowever, it may be difficult for leaders to ignore climate change during their stay at Doral. Miami\u2019s weather in June typically features hot and humid conditions, with the possibility of an early-season tropical storm or hurricane. Hurricane season, after all, starts June 1. The average daily high temperature in June in Miami since 2000 is 89 degrees, along with an average dew point of 74.5. Those two figures combine to give an average monthly heat index of 99 degrees.\n\nLeaders of the G-7 nations won\u2019t have to travel far to see the impacts of global warming. The city is under siege from rising sea levels and record heat, with local leaders and state officials taking increasingly drastic steps to reduce \u201csunny-day flooding\u201d due to natural high tides combined with a climate-change-related rise in sea level.\n\nMatthew Cappucci contributed to this report.", "description": "Despite the Miami area's vulnerability to the effects of climate change, the Trump administration plans to keep the topic off the agenda.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bzuO0FZHw8t94tx_0cfHKgqwaXw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M7GMVRHRAAI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
