If the blob of blue-checkmark Twitterati wanted to help President Trump portray the latest impeachment push as a partisan witch hunt, they couldn\u2019t have done a better job than they are now.\n\nConsider the latest example: On Sunday, CBS\u2019 venerable \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program reported on Twitter that \u201cthe government whistleblower who set off the impeachment inquiry of President Trump is under federal protection because they fear for their safety.\u201d The explosive news seemed to vindicate his opponents\u2019 darkest fantasies about the president: Of course Trump would physically threaten a whistleblower, much as the Corleone family would deal with a snitch.\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower is being protected from the executive branch of his or her own government,\u201d fretted Aaron Rupar of Vox. \u201cThat\u2019s not quite right,\u201d The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum chimed in. \u201cThe whistleblower is also at risk from the private citizen supporters the president incites to violence.\u201d\n\nAnd so on until \u2014 oops: As Politico reported, \u201can attorney for the whistleblower in the Trump-Ukraine scandal said Sunday that CBS\u2019 \u201860 Minutes\u2019 had \u2018completely misinterpreted\u2019 a document from his legal group, after the news outlet tweeted that the whistleblower was now under federal protection.\u201d\n\nIt turns out the lawyers had merely asked Joseph Maguire, the director of national intelligence, for \u201cappropriate resources to ensure [their client\u2019s] safety.\u201d That\u2019s emphatically not the same thing as the whistleblower enjoying federal protection.\n\nWhy does the difference matter? To claim, as CBS did, that the whistleblower is under protection suggests that some federal agency had already assessed his security needs and determined that he faces significant enough threats to justify such protection. A request isn\u2019t the same thing as a request granted.\n\nsee also Down with Green hypocrisy and other commentary Climate desk: Down With Green Hypocrisy & Hype From \u201cpoliticians...\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s safety concerns may be legitimate. Or they might be politically motivated, aimed at shielding him and his claims from scrutiny. After all, as the intelligence community inspector general noted, the whistleblower has a \u201cpolitical bias\u201d in favor of one of Trump\u2019s rivals. It isn\u2019t unreasonable to suspect that a political actor might use unfounded concerns about \u201csafety\u201d as a shield and a sword.\n\nBy jumping the gun and misreporting the whistleblower\u2019s request, CBS disserved its audience. The outlet also lent more credence to the Trumpian belief that the Democratic-media complex will play dirty if it means getting their man. Add this to the New York Times\u2019 all-but-retracted story about a new accuser against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh; MSNBC\u2019s retracted story about Trump\u2019s financial arrangements with Russian oligarchs; BuzzFeed\u2019s debunked story about Trump suborning perjury; ABC\u2019s retracted story about Trump ordering a subordinate to make contact with the Kremlin during his campaign; and on and on.\n\nTake in this enormous pile of fake news, and it soon becomes clear that the media are their own worst enemy \u2014 and Trump\u2019s unwitting best friends.\n\nSohrab Ahmari is The Post\u2019s op-ed editor.", "description": "Consider the latest example: On Sunday, CBS\u2019 venerable \u201c60 Minutes\u201d program reported on Twitter that \u201cthe government whistleblower who set off the impeachment inquiry of President Trump is under federal protection because they fear for their safety.\u201d", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/d-trump-60.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
