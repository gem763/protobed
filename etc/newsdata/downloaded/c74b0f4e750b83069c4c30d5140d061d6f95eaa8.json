Lovecraft descendant to directly subvert his racism", "language": "en", "text": "Warning: broad spoilers ahead for season 1 of Carnival Row.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft is one of the most imaginative, singular, brilliant, and influential horror writers of all time. He\u2019s also one of the most overtly, profoundly racist. Lovecraft\u2019s fans and heirs have long struggled with the question of how to separate his particular vision of cosmic horror from the visceral loathing of non-white people he expressed in his work.\n\nIn the past, authors like August Derleth and Stephen King have mostly tried to ignore the prejudice, concentrating instead on Lovecraft\u2019s vision of a grotesque universe bent on humanity\u2019s destruction and the joys of his clotted, tentacular, Cyclopean prose. More recently, though, several writers have engaged Lovecraft\u2019s racism more directly. These creators are turning Lovecraft inside out, exposing his wet, ugly innards for antiracist purposes. The new Amazon eight-episode fantasy series Carnival Row is one of the first indications that this strand of antiracist Lovecraft fiction is traveling out of genre fiction and into more mainstream entertainment.\n\nSome apologists, like scholar S.T. Joshi, have argued that Lovecraft\u2019s offensive views were only central to a few of his lesser works, like the bigoted poem with a title that starts \u201cOn the Creation Of\u201d and ends with a racist slur. Those protests aren\u2019t convincing, though. Racism permeates Lovecraft\u2019s work. The vast, terrible cosmic horrors he wrote about are always connected to his fear that the pure, upstanding white race is being corrupted and overrun with foul emanations from the less eugenically pure. In Lovecraft\u2019s classic 1926 story The Call of Cthulhu, for example, the Elder Gods from outside space and time are remembered and venerated by \u201cEsquimau diabolists and mongrel Louisianans\u201d \u2014 by non-white people, in other words.\n\nBy contrast, Lovecraft\u2019s protagonist is Gustaf Johansen, a white Norwegian sailor. And when he and his shipmates encounter Cthulhu\u2019s non-white human followers, they butcher them in a fury, which Lovecraft enthusiastically endorses. \u201cThere was some peculiarly abominable quality about [Cthulhu\u2019s worshippers] which made their destruction seem almost a duty,\u201d Lovecraft writes. In his view, the fanciful tale of mystic horror is also a call to genocide.\n\nMost of the horror writers channeling Lovecraft\u2019s style or subject matter haven\u2019t larded their prose with slurs or calls to race war. But some contemporary writers are now going further by writing Lovecraftian horror that directly acknowledges and repudiates Lovecraft\u2019s ugly bigotries.\n\nRuthanna Emrys\u2019 remarkable The Litany of Earth, for example, is told from the perspective of one of Lovecraft\u2019s fish-people from the story The Shadow over Innsmouth. For Lovecraft, the Innsmouth inhabitants were evil because they were associated with racial mixing, which tainted them and caused them to de-evolve. For Emrys, though, the shadow in Innsmouth is the evil white people bring with them when their government murders the town\u2019s inhabitants for the sin of being different. The real horror in this story update isn\u2019t fish-people; it\u2019s violent prejudice, as seen from the monsters\u2019 perspective.\n\nMatt Ruff\u2019s novel Lovecraft Country takes a different approach to antiracism. The book is set in the 1950s, and its lead characters are all black. Next to the constant threats of life inside an inherently biased, racist system, the various space creatures, curses, and ghosts that the protagonists encounter are almost a pleasant diversion. Lovecraft was imaginative and entertaining, the book suggests, but his racism and his whiteness meant he didn\u2019t know much about fear. (Lovecraft Country is being turned into an HBO series helmed by Jordan Peele and J.J. Abrams.)\n\nNovelist N.K. Jemisin is also planning a novel about a multiracial group of New Yorkers who fight Cthulhu. As she put it in a publisher\u2019s interview: \u201cThis is deliberately a chance for me to kind of mess with the Lovecraft legacy. He was a notorious racist and horrible human being. So this is a chance for me to have the \u2018chattering\u2019 hordes \u2014 that\u2019s what he called the horrifying brown people of New York that terrified him. This is a chance for me to basically have them kick the ass of his creation. So I\u2019m looking forward to having some fun with that.\u201d\n\nCarnival Row is just the latest narrative to repurpose Lovecraft\u2019s tropes into an antiracist story. Still, the way it uses Lovecraft\u2019s legacy is innovative, not least because it\u2019s so casual. The series is set in a steampunk alternate fantasy Earth. Pixies, fauns, centaurs, and other faerie creatures (or \u201ccritch\u201d) live in the segregated neighborhood of Carnival Row in a London-like city. Humans generally hate the critch, and one man with a hammer has started to murder them indiscriminately. Police detective Rycroft Philostrate (Orlando Bloom) is determined to bring the killer to justice despite his department\u2019s indifference to the killings.\n\nPhilo does catch the murderer, \u201cJack,\u201d in the first episode. Cornered, the guy starts to spout ominous gibberish in the tried-and-true manner of many of Lovecraft\u2019s half-mad, Elder-God-touched sailors and riffraff.\n\n\u201cThink I\u2019m mad?\u201d Jack rants. \u201cI know darkness. I\u2019ve been to the twilight edge of the world and dredged up things from the sunless deep that would turn your blood cold. But nothing like what I saw in the dark beneath our very feet. You\u2019re ill-prepared for the darkness that lies ahead. There is more here than you can fathom. While you go about your life so sure that this little world belongs to you, some Dark God wakes!\u201d That\u2019s a nicely baroque variation on Lovecraft\u2019s famous line, \u201cIn his house at R\u2019lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Carnival Row meets the dark god: a slimy, shambling horror, with tentacles hanging from its face. It looks a good bit like Cthulhu fan art. But it resembles Lovecraftian beasties in other ways, too. The critch are marginalized people from a foreign land. In the series, they\u2019re a metaphorical stand-in for immigrants, sex workers, and people of color \u2014 all the chattering hordes Lovecraft hated. \u201cThey come from a dark place and they haven\u2019t come alone. They\u2019ve brought something with them,\u201d Jack warns. As in Lovecraft\u2019s work, non-white people are a threatening, indistinguishable mass, embodied by the ugly cosmic horrors they bring to the sane, rational foundations painstakingly built by white men.\n\nCarnival Row\u2019s dark god is a creation of critch magic. But it wasn\u2019t raised as a weapon against humans. It was brought to life by one of those humans. The Cthulhu-thing is sewn together from dead flesh, but it\u2019s just a puppet. Someone has to magically pull its strings. It\u2019s a mask some human wears, just as Cthulhu is a mask Lovecraft wore.\n\nCarnival Row sets the audience up to think that marginalized people have birthed a monster, in standard Lovecraft fashion. But then it reveals that the actual monster is built by those in power, who create an ugly caricature of the race they hate, then use that caricature for murder. The clear suggestion is that Lovecraft\u2019s real racism, rather than his fictional monsters, was the threat facing a civilized society.\n\nLovecraft isn\u2019t Carnival Row\u2019s primary focus. Unlike Emrys and Ruff, the show\u2019s creators deal with and dismiss Cthulhu off to the side of the main romance and intrigue plots. Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and the fantasy genre are all arguably more important influences on the series than Lovecraft.\n\nBut that makes the antiracist twist on his work feel even more significant. We seem to be reaching a tipping point in Lovecraft influence where even works not explicitly devoted to addressing his racism will still have to contend with his legacy and find ways to acknowledge and subvert it. Carnival Row is more evidence that the smartest, most successful uses of Lovecraftian tropes don\u2019t avoid or ignore his racism. Instead, they confront it and use it to enrich the narrative and surprise the audience. They\u2019re making something bigger and better from his work.", "description": "Authors like August Derleth and Stephen King have tried to take up H.P.
