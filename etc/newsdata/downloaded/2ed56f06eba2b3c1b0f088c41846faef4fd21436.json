With them having one off, we were probably trying to push the game a little bit too much.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a bit rusty too after two easy games and a long break. That came out in the first half and second half we got a bit better rhythm.\u2019", "description": "Billy Vunipola was removed at half-time with an apparent ankle injury to leave England fans worried about his status going forward in the Rugby World Cup.
