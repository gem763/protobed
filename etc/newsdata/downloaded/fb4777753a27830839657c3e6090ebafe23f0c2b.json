So, when we considered expanding our service we wanted to make sure that the demand is high enough to make sure drivers make the most amount of money,\u201d Gareth Taylor, manager for Taxify in South Africa, told Business Insider South Africa.\n\n\u201cWe believe that when our drivers are looked after, our customers are looked after.\u201d\n\nAccording to data from App Annie, Uber has roughly 5.3 million users in South Africa compared to Taxify\u2019s 2.1 million.\n\nThis means Uber controls an estimated 71% of the South African market, followed by Taxify with 28%.\n\nFor more, go to Business Insider South Africa.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Taxify takes 15% of the fee charged via its platform, numbers it provided shows.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8018/ff041b132aa3441dabafe54cc03e8f58.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-22"}
