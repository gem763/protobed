'SNL' offers laugh-out-loud social commentary on race", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge was host and Taylor Swift served as musical guest on the Oct. 5 episode of \"Saturday Night Live.\" (Photo: Rosalind O'Connor/NBC)\n\nThough the topics \"President Trump\" and \"impeachment\" loomed large during host Phoebe Waller-Bridge's episode of \"Saturday Night Live,\" two of the funniest sketches were about something else entirely.\n\nTheir common theme: Race relations.\n\nMusical guest: Taylor Swift shows off her voice with performances of 'Lover' and 'False God'\n\nIn \"Mid-Day News,\" Waller-Bridge and her other news co-anchors (Kenan Thompson, Ego Nwodim, Alex Moffat and Chris Redd) learn that a suspected robber of a gas station is white. As a result, the black anchors high five and cheer on-air, celebrating the fact that they're \"just glad that he ain't one of us.\" The white anchors are aghast over \"this petty game,\" until they find out that a man assaulted someone for stepping on his Air Jordans. \"That's black, for sure,\" says Moffat, who proceeds to dab.\n\nThe WANU news reading of crime stories becomes an intra-office battle of black v. white, with perp descriptions that subvert expectations of race, and reactions (particularly from Nwodim) that are laugh-out-loud funny.\n\nIn the sketch \"Royal Romance,\" the premise is race-focused, as well: Before Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan, there was another biracial royal couple. Who?\n\nDuchess of Clerkenwell (Waller-Bridge) and Jimmy Jay Robinson, aka blaxploitation street poet Thunderstick (Thompson). Documentary footage includes Thunderstick \"knighting\" Sir Mix-A-lot.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/06/snl-host-phoebe-waller-bridges-funniest-sketches-race/3889937002/", "description": "When Phoebe Waller Bridge served as \"SNL\" host, two of the funniest sketches of the night were focused on race: \"Mid-Day News\" and \"Royal Romance.\"", "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum", "Published A.M.
