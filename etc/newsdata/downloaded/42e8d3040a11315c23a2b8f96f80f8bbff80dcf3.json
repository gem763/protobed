Rodgers returns to Anfield \u2013 and Leicester could beat Liverpool\n\nBrendan Rodgers returns to Anfield for the first time since leaving Liverpool, and he brings with him a Leicester side fully capable of ending Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side\u2019s winning start. Liverpool may have made a perfect Premier League start but they have looked somewhat vulnerable at the back, particularly beyond the right side of their defence.\n\nLeicester may well look to spring Jamie Vardy behind Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez in the absence of Joel Matip, and they have plenty of quality to take advantage of any defensive insecurities Liverpool do have.

Spurs must bounce back\n\nFollowing their Champions League embarrassment, Tottenham\u2019s trip to Brighton has an added weight to it. Their looked to be back on track after a well-fought victory over Southampton last week but Bayern\u2019s dominant display in midweek brought them back down to earth. After a run of inconsistent performances, facing Brighton \u2013 who haven\u2019t won since the opening day against Watford \u2013 could be what kick-starts Spurs\u2019 season.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Joel Matip (Liverpool) Not always the prettiest on the ball but he plays out from the back effectively. Alongside van Dijk he has been impressive by his own merit with his domineering physical presence. Getty Images 3/31 29. Ashley Barnes (Burnley) He still makes the list despite his recent halt in form. He has largely been a difficult prospect for defenders this season, grabbing four goals. PA 4/31 28. Sebastien Haller (West Ham) A difficult start has soon blossomed into powerful performances for Haller. He has three goals and an assist to boot in a West Ham side with high hopes this season. Getty Images 5/31 27. Caglar Soyuncu (Leicester) Excellent against Spurs, and doing his best to fill the Harry Maguire shaped gap. He\u2019s a different defender to Man Utd\u2019s new powerhouse. Smaller, but technically gifted and a tenacious defender. Getty Images 6/31 26. Andriy Yarmolenko (West Ham) Has returned with a bang since tearing his Achilles last season. The opener against Man Utd last weekend was followed up with another classy finish against Bournemouth. AFP/Getty Images 7/31 25. John McGinn (Aston Villa) Easily Villa\u2019s best player this season. Tenacious, adventurous and has notched some goals too. He\u2019s on three for the season, including two in his last two against Burnley and Arsenal. Villa may be struggling, but McGinn is flourishing in the top flight. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 8/31 24. Daniel James (Manchester United) The young Welshman has impressed in an underwhelming Man United side. Any suspicions that he needed time to settle in the top tier have been quickly dismissed. Getty Images 9/31 23. Enda Stevens (Sheffield United) His performance against Liverpool showed his delivery is first class, control is immaculate and defensive work is sound too. Truth is he has been flawless so far this season, and will soon receive more than a few plaudits. Getty Images 10/31 22. Youri Tielemans (Leicester) Level on number of through balls with Kevin De Bruyne and providing more than a supporting role for Maddison, Tielemans has been excellent. Action Images via Reuters 11/31 21. Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Manchester United) Wan-Bissaka has been a cause for optimism in an otherwise disappointing Man Utd side. He has made more tackles than any other player this season (31) and has been a stable part of United\u2019s faltering defence. Getty Images 12/31 20. Gary Cahill (Crystal Palace) What a signing for Palace. Made his debut in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford and Palace have since kept two clean sheets. Cahill\u2019s experience has definitely contributed to that. REUTERS 13/31 19. Mohamed Salah (Liverpool) Wasteful at Bramall Lane and bailed out by a goalkeeping error. But still enjoying yet another fine campaign. Getty Images 14/31 18. Todd Cantwell (Norwich) He isn\u2019t blessed with pace or flamboyant skill. But he finds space and you can\u2019t knock a player who has scored against Chelsea and Man City this season. Getty Images 15/31 17. Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool) An average performance against Sheffield United on Saturday. But the week before he scored a brilliant goal at Stamford Bridge and Liverpool still have the best defence in the league. Getty Images 16/31 16. Emiliano Buendia (Norwich) An under-acclaimed part of Norwich\u2019s attacking success this season. He\u2019s second in the assists chart on four and has been simply sensational. Pukki\u2019s right hand man. REUTERS 17/31 15. Sadio Mane (Liverpool) The last couple of game have been frustrating for Mane. Especially Saturday\u2019s clash with Sheffield United where he missed two golden chances. Still, he\u2019s on four goals for the season and will surely be up there in the Golden Boot contest. Getty Images 18/31 14. Mason Mount (Chelsea) His pressing and goal scoring touch have been magnificent. A big future ahead. Getty Images 19/31 13. Ederson (Manchester City) e is joint first in the race for the Golden Glove, and yesterday\u2019s game at Goodison could have gone very differently without a number of big saves. Getting down to Mina\u2019s second half header the highlight. PA 20/31 12. Andy Robertson (Liverpool) Mr Reliable is at it again this season. Rarely a mistake and he has also contributed two assists going forward this season. He also made a crucial block at 0-0 against Sheffield United that changed the course of the game. Getty Images 21/31 11. Callum Wilson (Bournemouth) A goal against West Ham on Saturday and a delightful brace including a long range lob against Everton the week before. This man wants to be on the plane come June. AFC Bournemouth via Getty Images 22/31 10. Roberto Firmino (Liverpool) Firmino is at his best again this season. In typical fashion, not topping the goal charts, not topping the assist charts, but contributing in both with three of each. Unsung hero klaxon. Getty Images 23/31 9. Tammy Abraham (Chelsea) He didn\u2019t get a goal on Saturday against Brighton, but Chelsea\u2019s no.9 linked up well with his colleagues in attack. He\u2019s still second in the Golden Boot race on seven. Getty Images 24/31 8. James Maddison (Leicester) A simply blistering performance against Spurs last week. The way he has ran games so far this season makes him a shoe-in for England. CameraSport via Getty Images 25/31 7. Raheem Sterling (Manchester City) He was arguably the best player on the pitch against Everton, and yet again he grabbed a goal thanks to goal line technology. He\u2019s on six for the season now. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 26/31 6. Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur) The Englishman dragged his side out of a big hole on Saturday. His winner helped Spurs see off Southampton despite being a man down. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but it was decisive. AFP/Getty 27/31 5. Teemu Pukki (Norwich) The Finnish striker hasn\u2019t hit the mark in the last two games - defeats at Palace and Burnley. He is still on six goals and two assists with a home game against Villa up next. A good chance to rediscover his form. Getty Images 28/31 4. Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) On am incredible eight goals and two assists already, Aguero failed to score for the first time on Saturday - but only because he was rested for much of the game. PA 29/31 3. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal) With Lacazette injured, the Gabon international has stepped up to the mark in his preferred striker position. He was also scoring regularly from the left though, and grabbed a crucial winner from a free kick last week against Villa. United next for Arsenal. Getty Images 30/31 2. Virgil van Dijk (Liverpool) Liverpool benefited from a substantial amount of luck against Sheffield United. But they also had the best defender in the world at the peak of his powers. Seven clearances, 12 aerial duels won, and 12 completed long passes. Table toppers. Getty Images 31/31 1. Kevin de Bruyne (Manchester City) The Belgian midfielder is on fire. He leads the assists chart on eight, four ahead of next best. With two goals on top of that, no one has been involved in more goals than him.

Manchester City FC via Getty Ima\n\nWith the teams placed fourth and eleventh separated by just two points, it\u2019s vital they keep pace and not fall by the wayside. AdR\n\n3. Wolves sense another potential scalp\n\nWolves have quietly gathered themselves in recent games. Perhaps it was that penalty shootout win over Reading in the League Cup that galvanised them: since then they have beaten Watford in the Premier League before a vital 1-0 Europa League victory over Besiktas over Thursday night. The game in Istanbul offered something of a template for Sunday\u2019s trip to the Etihad: soak up the pressure, limit their opponents to a few half-chances, before hitting them with a sucker-punch.\n\nManchester City present a substantially tougher task, but Wolves\u2019 record against the top six was outstanding last season and they will not be overawed at the Etihad. LO\n\n4. Unai Emery\u2019s midfield muddle\n\nThere is a sense that Unai Emery has not quite figured out how to sculpt the Arsenal midfield ahead of their game with Bournemouth. Granit Xhaka offers little but has been named captain, while Lucas Torreira is lacking in both form and a definite role. Matteo Guendouzi has impressed, yes, but with Joe Willock so good in the Europa League and the bizarre exclusion of Dani Ceballos somewhat inexplicable, this could be the perfect opportunity to look at a new combination in midfield.\n\nBournemouth are yet to pick up a point at the Emirates Stadium, but possess forward players who can cause damage in an unstable contest. Emery needs to get his selection right. HLC\n\n5. Weary rivals renew hostilities\n\nOne of the great old Premier League rivalries will renew on Sunday with both clubs wandering directionless into their meeting at St James\u2019 Park. Steve Bruce took on a funereal tone as he attempted to explain Newcastle\u2019s 5-0 thrashing at the hands of Leicester City last weekend, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer opted for a more chipper message following United\u2019s draw with AZ Alkmaar on Thursday night \u2013 one that smacked of delusion.\n\nSolskjaer surely cannot afford to extend United\u2019s winless away streak beyond its current 10-game run, but perhaps the oddest part of this game is that, given United\u2019s shortcomings, Newcastle will be disappointed not to get something from the game too. LO\n\n6. Frank Lampard and evolution rather than revolution\n\nFive or four at the back for Chelsea against Southampton? Frank Lampard has found a degree of success with both systems in recent weeks, but the former looks particularly solid, with the remnants of the Antonio Conte era are rediscovering themselves in a back five.\n\nIndeed, for all the talk of revolution at Stamford Bridge, Lampard has largely allied himself to the systems that have gone before \u2013 Sarri\u2019s 4-3-3, Conte\u2019s 3-4-3 \u2013 partially due to Chelsea\u2019s inability to bring players in during the transfer window, and it seems he may be settling on the latter for the medium-term. Evolution, then, rather than revolution.\n\nSouthampton have similar questions over their set-up \u2013 it was a five against Tottenham last week after Cedric pulled up in the warm-up, but Hasenhuttl may return to his favoured 4-2-2-2 as Southampton look to best Chelsea. HLC\n\n7. Marco Silva and Everton need to produce\n\nAs they have done for many-a-season, Everton have struggled to meet pre-season expectations. This season, the Toffees have looked both scintillating in attack and porous in defence which has led to consistently inconsistent performances. Against Wolves, they looked unplayable but disappointing outings at Bournemouth and at home to Sheffield United have pegged them back.\n\nA trip to Burnley won\u2019t be easy for Marco Silva but it is in these games where he must prove Everton can be a team that could puncture the top six. Currently 15th, his side look far off that, and after a season in which they won 15 games and lost 14 last year, Silva must make his team more consistent to be considered a real threat. AdR\n\n8. Hammers a dark horse?\n\nAfter a sketchy reintroduction to Premier League football against Manchester City, West Ham have quietly crept up the table. Now in fifth place, and only outside the top four on goal difference, Manuel Pellegrini has formed a side that looks like it can do what Everton can\u2019t: take their chances and be hard to beat.\n\nA good attacking side, their variety can benefit them highly. S\u00e9bastien Haller has shown to be a good all-around striker as well as a goal-scorer, Felipe Anderson and Andriy Yarmolenko are coming into their own coming in off the wings and they can hurt you from direct set pieces.\n\nA point behind them in 9th, however, Crystal Palace won\u2019t be pushovers but West Ham may have too much firepower for them to handle. AdR\n\n9. Will Villa take off against Norwich?\n\nAston Villa have looked dangerous so far this season but have lacked true killer instincts. Dropping eight points from winning positions this term, closing out games has been Villa\u2019s biggest problem and has seen them drop into the relegation zone. Facing Norwich \u2013 who sit just a point and a place ahead of them in 17th \u2013 this could be the chance Dean Smith\u2019s side have been looking for.\n\nTaking the lead against both Arsenal and Tottenham as well as performing well against established Premier League teams like Everton and Crystal Palace, Villa have shown they can compete at this level. But taking points from those in and around them could prove crucial for survival and they have a chance to do just that this weekend. AdR\n\n10. Sheffield United look to add to Watford\u2019s strife\n\nAhead of the season, a trip to Watford may have looked daunting for a newly-promoted team. Seven games in, and there isn\u2019t quite the same aura around Vicarage Road. Still searching for their first Premier League win of the season, the Hornets have looked lacklustre under both Javi Gracia and their new-old boss Quique Sanchez Flores.\n\nSheffield United, on the other hand, have looked anything but lacklustre. Chris Wilder has brought an exciting, hardworking team to the top flight and they look like they can cause anyone a problem.\n\nFacing Liverpool without star striker, Billy Sharp, they still looked dangerous in attack and were unlucky to get anything out of the game. Translating a performance like that against the European champions to a struggling Watford shouldn\u2019t be a problem and Wilder could push his team into the top half as Watford stay rock bottom.
