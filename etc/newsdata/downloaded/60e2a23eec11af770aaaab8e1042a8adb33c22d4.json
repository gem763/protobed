They play football differently to us. We did things well from the start. We let in two goals again, but I think it was a good performance overall.\"\n\nIt has been a turbulent week for Valencia, with head coach Marcelino axed by owner Peter Lim and Albert Celades installed in his place.\n\nCelades admitted his side paid for poor starts to both halves, saying on valenciacf.com: \"We had a start to the game where we conceded two goals very fast, and against a team like this it is difficult to turn it around.\n\n\"But the team responded well, we scored and we could have scored some more. We left with good feelings at half-time, but the start of the second half hurt us. Despite the result, we showed desire to the end and scored a goal in injury time because the players still desired.\"", "description": "Clement Lenglet has called for Ansu Fati to be given time to mature after the teenager stole the show again for Barcelona\u00a0against Valencia.
