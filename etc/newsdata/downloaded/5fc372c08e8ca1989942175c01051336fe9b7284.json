Soooo what gives with the totally random spotting you see in your underwear today? Getting your period is annoying enough \u2014 no one wants to blow through their entire tampon stock before a period shows up for real.\n\nInconvenience aside, spotting before your period can put you a little on edge if you\u2019re just not sure what\u2019s going on with your body. But don\u2019t freak out, as there are a bunch of reasons for why your period is getting ahead of itself that are usually no big deal.\n\nSpotting before your period is most likely related to your body\u2019s ovulation patterns.\n\nThe biggest factor at play typically is\u2026hormones (surprise!). \u201c[Spotting before your period] means you\u2019re not ovulating perfectly and not making as much progesterone as you should,\u201d says Dr Mary Jane Minkin, a clinical professor in the department of obstetrics, gynaecology, and reproductive sciences at the Yale University School of Medicine.\n\nProgesterone is one of the hormones involved with making menstruation happen, and Dr Minkin says it plays an important role in stabilizing the lining of your uterus. If you don\u2019t make enough of it during your cycle, some of your uterine lining may be discharged in the five to seven days before your period, which is that spotting you notice.\n\nThis is mostly just an annoyance; you don\u2019t have to do anything to address progesterone production, and nothing bad will happen if you ignore it. (The exception here is if you\u2019re planning a pregnancy, in which case you should talk to your ob-gyn about having your hormone levels tested.)\n\nBut if the spotting is really bugging you, you can take birth control pills with progesterone, which stop ovulation altogether and provide you with a consistent amount of hormones each month.\n\nNow, what if imperfect ovulation isn\u2019t the cause of your pre-period spotting? You\u2019re probably still not dealing with anything super serious. Dr Minkin stresses that bigger health problems that can cause spotting (we\u2019ll get into some of those in a sec) would also cause symptoms throughout your *whole* cycle, not just the week before your period.\n\nHere are nine other reasons why you might be spotting prior to your period\u2019s big arrival \u2014 and what you can do about \u2019em.\n\nREAD MORE: This Is Why You Get Clots In Your Period Blood\n\n1. You\u2019re on a new birth control.\n\nYou\u2019re more likely to see spotting throughout your entire cycle if you started a new type of BC, Dr Minkin says, but this could also cause spotting right before your period specifically. This is called breakthrough bleeding, and the estrogen in your birth control is to blame.\n\nBreakthrough bleeding should resolve on its own in a few months after you start your new BC. If it goes on longer than that, Dr Minkin suggests talking to your doc, who may recommend a birth-control method with a lower amount of estrogen.\n\n2. You\u2019re pregnant.\n\nSurprise: You thought your period was arriving a week early, but it turns out it won\u2019t be back for another nine months! Spotting ahead of your normal period week might actually be an early sign of pregnancy, says Dr Minkin. The spotting you\u2019re noticing might actually be implantation bleeding (a.k.a. when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining) or even just the early stages of pregnancy itself.\n\n\u201cAbout one-third of women will bleed in the first three months of pregnancy,\u201d explains Dr Minkin, who notes that this (obviously) makes some people nervous but does not necessarily signal that anything is wrong with the pregnancy.\n\nIf you see spotting the week before your period typically comes but then don\u2019t get a full-fledged period soon after, you should consider taking a pregnancy test.\n\n3. You have a hormone imbalance.\n\nJust like how progesterone can mess with your period, abnormal levels of estrogen may also be to blame for your spotting. Yes, this could mean estrogen changes related to a new BC, as mentioned above, or those associated with perimenopause or menopause.\n\nA thyroid issue may also be at play here. According to Dr Minkin, if you have hypothyroidism (meaning your thyroid produces less thyroid hormone than it should) you might miss periods. And if you deal with hyperthyroidism (when you have an excess of thyroid hormone), you might have heavier periods. Both of these may cause spotting between periods.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with thyroid dysfunction, you would likely have other symptoms in addition to period issues, such as weight loss/gain or fatigue. It\u2019s likely that your doc would rule out other possible underlying reasons for your pre-period spotting but possibly test your thyroid hormone levels if she suspects a thyroid problem.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Is My Period Blood Brown All Of A Sudden?\n\n4. You\u2019re under the weather.\n\nDr Minkin says almost any kind of illness or infection, from influenza to pneumonia to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), can throw your whole cycle out of whack and give you any kind of irregular bleeding, including spotting. So if you\u2019re spotting before your period but also battling some kind of sickness, chalk it up to your immune system doing what it does best: prioritizing where it needs to direct more of its energy to get you healthy.\n\nThat said, if your spotting comes with pain, fever, or a foul vaginal odour, you should check in with your doc \u2014 it could point to the kind of infection that requires medical treatment (like an STD or the aforementioned PID).\n\n5. You just had sex.\n\nOn another note, early spotting could be (coincidentally) linked to something else you just happened to do the week before your period \u2014 like getting busy with a sexual partner.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t actually have anything to do with your period. Medically referred to as \u201cpost-coital bleeding,\u201d spotting a bit of blood after recently having sex may happen as a result of friction during intercourse, like if the vaginal lining gets damaged or if you don\u2019t have proper lubrication, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nBleeding in the days after having intercourse doesn\u2019t necessitate a call to your provider unless it\u2019s happening all the time, Dr Minkin says. \u201cIf it happens once and goes away, it\u2019s unlikely to be anything bad\u2026but if it\u2019s repetitive, we get concerned about precancerous changes on the cervix and would want to do a Pap smear,\u201d she explains.\n\nREAD MORE: 25 Reasons Why You\u2019ve Got Period Symptoms But No Period\n\n6. You\u2019re dealing with fibroids.\n\nUterine fibroids are benign growths that appear in or close to the uterus, as Women\u2019s Health reported previously. When women visit their gyno and end up discovering they have fibroids, it often has to do with the fact that they were experiencing abnormal bleeding (which could mean before their period, but more likely is happening periodically throughout the entire cycle) and heavy periods that last longer than a week.\n\nFibroids tend to bring on other symptoms in addition to abnormal bleeding. Those may include pelvic pain or pressure, constipation, the need to pee frequently, and more, according to the Mayo Clinic. So if you have bleeding (especially if it\u2019s heavy) when your period should not be happening, not to mention any of these other symptoms, see your Doc. You can get diagnosed via an ultrasound and lab tests.\n\n7. You have endometrial or cervical cancer.\n\nGynaecological cancers can present with abnormal bleeding, so it\u2019s important to take any vaginal bleeding that you\u2019re concerned about seriously and get it checked out.\n\nAs Dr Minkin points out, a little bit of spotting right before your period in particular most likely isn\u2019t cause for concern. With these cancers, symptoms would happen throughout your whole cycle. (In addition to abnormal bleeding, other symptoms of endometrial or cervical cancers include pelvic pain and bloating.)\n\nBut with any health symptom that you feel uneasy about, don\u2019t hold back from getting an expert opinion sooner rather than later\u2014even if it turns out to be nothing serious. You know your body best and are your number-one health advocate.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Really, uterus?", "authors": ["Sarah Bradley"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8975/b3d9d2670f0e45d88e98c5fbb3605092.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-28"}
