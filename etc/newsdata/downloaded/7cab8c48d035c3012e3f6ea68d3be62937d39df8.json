Here\u2019s how to make sure they stay healthy and avoid loneliness\n\nThere are thought to be more than 1.5m pet rabbits in the UK, and a large proportion of them could be leading very sad lives. A study of more than 6,000 rabbits treated by vets found alarming health conditions such as overgrown nails and teeth, digestive problems and skin issues.\n\nThanks to generations of stories featuring rabbits, and their sweet, cuddly appearance, they have long been a popular children\u2019s pet but, says Dan O\u2019Neill, senior lecturer in companion animal epidemiology at the Royal Veterinary College, and co-author of the study, \u201cthey are not a good child\u2019s pet at all.\u201d They are a prey animal \u2013 constantly alert to danger \u2013 so being handled by a noisy child can be stressful, especially if they are not used to it (if a child, say, only plays with the rabbit at the weekend).\n\nRabbit ownership is \u201ceasy to get right\u201d says Rae Todd, a director at the Rabbit Welfare Association & Fund, though many people are surprised by their needs. They are social animals \u2013 she recommends keeping two, a male and a female, both neutered. \u201cRabbits in the wild will cover about half an acre a day,\u201d she says. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve got a six-foot rabbit hutch, it\u2019s not big enough. They need access to a safe exercise area \u2013 the minimum we recommend for two average-sized rabbits is an area 3m by 2m, and 1m high.\u201d Rabbits have only really lived in hutches since Victorian times, she says, when they were bred for meat. \u201cHutches were short-term solutions, not long-term housing.\u201d\n\nTheir diet should mimic that in nature \u2013 the bulk of it grass or hay (avoid the muesli-type food that encourages them to eat only their favourite bits and can lead to obesity). They have evolved to hide signs of illness which can make spotting health problems hard \u2013 O\u2019Neill recommends six-monthly vet checkups (they need annual vaccinations too). \u201cTheir teeth grow continuously, and are designed for chewing rough hay, but if their teeth overgrow, they can\u2019t digest properly and their faeces become soft.\u201d\n\nCan the life of an unhappy, unhealthy rabbit be turned around? Physical health issues are hard to deal with, says O\u2019Neill, \u201cbecause by the time we\u2019re aware of some of the problems, it can be management rather than cure.\u201d Psychological issues are easier to solve. If you think you\u2019ve got an unhappy rabbit, give them a rabbit friend \u2013 and space to exercise.", "description": "A study of more than 6,000 rabbits treated by vets has found that many lead sad lives.
