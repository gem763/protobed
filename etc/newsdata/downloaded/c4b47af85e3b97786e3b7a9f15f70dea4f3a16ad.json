Miller's Late Breaking and Adam Foulds's Dream Sequence \u2014 both landed on the 2019 Giller Prize long list.\n\nAnd for Wells, more books under the Biblioasis umbrella means more opportunities for readers to connect with literature.\n\n\"My job as a publisher is to ride the wave as much as I can, when something like the Booker Prize happens,\" Wells said.\n\n\"I'm thrilled for Lucy [Ellmann] and this book, but we have other books as well that we care about equally \u2026 the hardest challenge here is to ensure that they all find the audiences they deserve.\"", "description": "When Dan Wells read Lucy Ellmann's latest novel \u2014 a 1,000-page stream of consciousness epic about an unnamed middle-aged Ohio woman living in Donald Trump's America \u2014 he knew \"this might be one of the most important things we're ever associated with as a publisher.\"", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3305969.1446754203!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/dan-wells-biblioasis.jpg"}
