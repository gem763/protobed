Try These Fresh Takes On TV Dinners", "language": "en", "text": "There are occasions that call for eating dinner in front of the TV \u2014 maybe it was a long week, everyone\u2019s tired, the game\u2019s on, it\u2019s movie night or the family is binge watching something on Netflix. You\u2019re going to want a little nosh in front of the tube anyway, so why not turn it into dinner and add some nutritional value, rather than down bowls of popcorn and chips?\n\nHere are a few ideas for meals that are easy to eat out of hand, curled up and cozy on the couch. Some of these can also be frozen in individual portions for healthier, more economical versions of traditional TV dinners anyone in the family can reheat when they need a quick meal.\n\nDinner Bowls\n\nMeals in bowls are all the rage, and can consist of just about anything. Most are based on cooked grains or noodles, topped with steamed or roasted fish or saut\u00e9ed meats and veggies, sliced avocado, nuts and seeds \u2014 really, anything goes. The idea is that all the ingredients are layered in a shallow bowl rather than segregated on a traditional dinner plate, mixing everything together and making them easier to eat with one hand.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 20-Minute Meals for Busy Weeknights\n\nFried Egg Hash\n\nPut an egg on anything \u2014 reheated grains, leftovers \u2014 and it\u2019s transformed into dinner. Even if you have nothing more than a potato and some veg, dice them up and cook in a drizzle of oil in a hot skillet until tender and caramelized, then transfer them to a bowl and fry an egg (or three) in the hot pan. Curl up with a fork and a bottle of ketchup.\n\nMac & Cheese\n\nThere are few foods as comforting as baked mac & cheese. Use your favourite recipe and add bits of leftover ham or sausage, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, or whatever you like that goes with pasta and cheese. Divide between individual baking dishes and bake until bubbly and golden, then wrap yourself in a blanket and tuck in.\n\nThin Crust Bar-Style Pizza\n\nRather than order delivery, make the quickest, crispiest pizzas out of flour tortillas. Let everyone choose their own toppings and spread them out on the coffee table to share, or let everyone have their own. With ultra-crisp crusts, you won\u2019t need much more than a stack of napkins.\n\nSlow Cooker 'Thai' Chicken Thighs\n\nMake your own frozen TV dinners by cooking a large batch of skinless, bone-in chicken thighs in the slow cooker! Combine 8 thighs, 1 cup salsa, \u00bd cup peanut butter, a couple tablespoons of lime juice and a shake of curry powder (and if you have a few more minutes, some fresh ginger and garlic, and perhaps a handful of chopped cilantro), cover and cook on low for 6 hours, or until the chicken is very tender and the sauce has thickened. Cook a pot of rice and divvy it between individual ovenproof dishes. Add some steamed broccoli, green beans or carrots, if you like. Cool, cover and freeze, then microwave when you need them. (Most slow cooker dishes freeze very well and can be done in individual portions.)\n\nNoodle Bowls\n\nA big pile of twirly, slurpy noodles makes a perfect TV pairing. Soak or cook up some Asian noodles, rice noodles or spaghetti and add broth, veggies, a squeeze of lime and squirt of sriracha. Or make a quick pad Thai sauce by whisking together 1/4 cup each ketchup, fish sauce and lime juice with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Add shredded leftover chicken, scrambled eggs, diced tofu, cooked shrimp, bean sprouts and fresh cilantro. Serve in a wide bowl with chopsticks.\n\nYou'll Also Love: 3 Salad Dressings that Might Actually Get Your Kids to Eat Salad\n\nA Big Salad\n\nLike Elaine on Seinfeld, you can do a big salad \u2014 like a regular salad, only bigger, with lots of stuff in it \u2014 to clean out the fridge and pantry. Start with a base of greens and then add grains, beans, veggies, cheese, hard boiled eggs, chopped apples, leftovers, toasted nuts and seeds \u2014 go for a variety of textures and something to add crunch, and take the bowl to the couch with your fork.", "description": "In a dinner rut?
