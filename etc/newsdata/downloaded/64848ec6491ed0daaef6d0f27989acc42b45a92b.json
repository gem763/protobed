It\u2019s a luxury condo now\u2019\n\nThis image was made in a loft in Brooklyn, New York, where I lived with Marion, my partner and now my wife, and where we started our family. It\u2019s where I came of age, I guess, and where I photographed most of the pictures for my book Son. It represents youth and love and home, and it\u2019s also particular to a place where we lived, and Brooklyn as a community.\n\nThat loft had a lot to do with my development as a photographer, particularly my use of light and colour, because it was bathed in bright sunlight most of the day. Though it was one step up from a squat, it was one of the important nodes of the creative community of Williamsburg. Many photographers lived there \u2013 including Tim Hetherington, Alex Majoli, Stanley Greene and Thomas Dworzak \u2013 and all these well-known sculptors and painters. Then it was bought by developers and we were all evicted in 2016. It was the end of an era. Now it\u2019s luxury condos.\n\nMy son was about eight months old; there are clothes and toys on the floor. Marion was still breastfeeding and here you have a scene that was part of our everyday life at the time, her feeding him there on the bed. It\u2019s a sexy image, but it\u2019s not as sexual as people might think.\n\nI was incredibly active as a photographer at the time, but I was starting to question my role. It was also in the aftermath of the economic crash, a time when photographers couldn\u2019t make a living any more, especially ones like me who had worked for magazines. I had been a war photographer, a photojournalist, but I was having trouble reconciling the idea of being a white male running around trying to say something about someone else\u2019s experiences.\n\nI was grappling with ideas of subjectivity and objectivity, and reaching the point where I understood that, no matter where I was, I was always photographing my own experience. I was coming to understand that the only thing I really had something to say about was my own life and what was immediately around me.\n\nThe idea that photographing my family could be of value was a revelation, and marked a shift in my understanding of my photographic world. I had taken pictures of my family before, but they were separate from my \u201cwork\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until my son was born in 2008 that I realised that not only were these photographs part of my work, they were the core of it.\n\nDo I think this image objectifies my wife [because you can\u2019t see her head]? It\u2019s a fair criticism, but I\u2019m incapable of seeing it because I don\u2019t see this picture in a vacuum. I see it in the context of a life with these people, and as part of a body of work about my family and my home, and people I love. It\u2019s like taking a sentence out of a book and trying to make a statement about the whole book.\n\nEven forgetting about context, I look at the image now and, trying to distance myself, I still see something about tenderness and caring and love. Again, I come back to love. I like to use the word subjectify \u2013 it\u2019s a joke, but it\u2019s also got a serious point. I think of photography as subjective, in terms of the person who makes the photograph but also in terms of the viewer, what they bring to it. I am inspired and amazed by the fact that these images resonated with people the way they did. The only thing I can attribute that to is this idea that I was trying to communicate something both universal and very specific.\n\nChristopher Anderson\u2019s CV\n\nPhotograph: Christopher Anderson\n\nBorn: Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, 1970. Grew up in Texas.\n\nStudied: Anthropology at Abilene Christian University, Texas.\n\nInfluences: \u201cYou can definitely see influences such as William Eggleston. Being North American and photographing in colour, I feel very much connected the American colour photography tradition. I am influenced as much by painting as photography.\u201d\n\nHigh point: Photography has given me a life full of rich experiences, from meeting Barack Obama to witnessing immigrants trying to cross the Caribbean in a small boat. But I don\u2019t think of photography as big-game hunting or ticking off a list of accomplishments. My highlight is the last photo I made.\u201d\n\nLow point: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think of even the difficult times as a low point.\u201d\n\nTop tip: \u201cKnow yourself, because until you do, you\u2019re trying to do something like someone else.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow Christopher Anderson on Instagram.
