Severen, who works at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, attacked the question with his full statistical arsenal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis analysis, conducted with Arthur van Benthem of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, was recently circulated as a working paper from the Philadelphia Fed and from the National Bureau for Economic Research.\n\nThe economists analyzed millions of government survey responses from the 1960s through the 2010s and found it wasn\u2019t just the Iran oil crisis. Gas prices left scars whenever and wherever they spiked throughout that period.\n\nIf inflation-adjusted gas prices doubled while someone was learning to drive, they found, that person would be less likely to drive to work later on, and would drive an average of 900 to 1,100 fewer miles each year as adults. They are also less likely to own gas-guzzling light trucks and more likely to take public transit.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe find that pretty surprising,\u201d Severen said. \u201cIn the U.S. most people drive to work and not much has budged that over the past few decades.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDrivers are only vulnerable to this level of scarring during that narrow slice of their teenage years when they\u2019re just learning to drive. When prices jump, scars don\u2019t appear in folks who were younger than 15 or older than 18. In some analyses, the researchers shifted the window to fit each state\u2019s driving-age requirements.\n\n\u201cYou develop a particular taste for driving from this formative window of when you\u2019re roughly 15 to 18, and that\u2019s influenced by gas-price volatility during that period,\" Severen said. \"People who experience these large shocks have a lower taste for driving.\u201d\n\nThe scars can\u2019t be explained by age, race, location, drivers\u2019 license requirements, or even whether or not gas price changes coincided with a recession.\n\nAD\n\nEconomists are finding evidence of scars like this throughout the economy, on scales ranging from individual shopping habits to the movements of the largest component of Gross Domestic Product.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, Ulrike Malmendier, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and Leslie Sheng Shen, now at the Federal Reserve, released an ambitious working paper in which they analyzed decades of data from several long-running surveys to estimate how high unemployment shaped consumers\u2019 psyches down the road.\n\nPeople who were unemployed substantially longer (one standard deviation more) would later spend about $1,035 less on food, and $4,492 less overall than a typical consumer, they found. Scarred consumers also bought more things on sale and used more coupons. The trends persisted even after accounting for possible complicating factors, such as income, wealth, age, geography and demographics.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Americans\u2019 scars pile up they can shift the entire economy. Consumer spending has long been the engine of U.S. economic growth. And the periods where it has been lowest in recent decades coincide with periods when the highest percentages of consumers bear the scars of a lifetime lived around high unemployment, Malmendier and Shen find.\n\nAD\n\nA 2014 analysis in Review of Economic Studies by Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo found Americans who lived through a recession between ages 18 and 25 \u201cbelieve that success in life depends more on luck than effort, support more government redistribution, and tend to vote for left-wing parties,\u201d and that these beliefs -- especially in government redistribution of resources -- can last for a lifetime.\n\nThe archetypal example of this phenomenon is the Depression Generation. The scars left on men and women who came of age during the Great Depression influenced their economic and political beliefs for decades.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an analogue in the current era, we\u2019ll note the Great Recession shaped the formative years of just one generation: the Millennials.\n\nMillennials really are special, data show\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Van Dam", "Reporter Focusing On Economic Data"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/mQoQ4K45E7DJUQcpeXYysWhXA64=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SABYSJHFFII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
