Not all of us will see the finish, but we will win together.\"\n\nAt Google, Knapp co-authored a safe-workplace petition that gathered over 2,500 hundred signatures, leading to new rules within the company against the employee harassment and guidelines as to what information could be shared on internal forums. Knapp also spoke out at a number of annual shareholder meetings, including one in 2018 when they called for Google executive's performance to be tied to the company's overall diversity metrics.\n\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on Knapp's departure.\n\nRead more: A Google engineer got up in front of the board and condemned the firm's 'chilling' diversity failures\n\nKnapp said after leaving Google they will be taking a \"few months to rest and recover,\" but after, will focus on making activism their \"full-time job.\"\n\nSpecifically, stemming from their work at Google, they will work on creating legislation around advertising privacy. Knapp also said they'll be joining forces with former Googler Jack Poulson, who created the non-profit Tech Inquiry, to advise and help support activism throughout the tech industry.\n\n\"My greatest achievements at Google are the communities I've built and defended. I have done all I can to make sure that these places are in good hands and will stand the test of time,\" Knapp wrote. \"I urge you all to stand by your communities and be there for each other.\"\n\nRead Irene Knapp's full Medium post here.\n\nGot a tip?
