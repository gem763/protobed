And that has upset head coach Jamie Joseph, who thinks anyone saying that is missing one thing.\n\nHis team has beaten Ireland, Russia and Samoa and tops the group and deserves a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals for the first time. And just to prove it, he wants the Pool A game to go ahead just as much as his Scottish counterparts, who will definitely miss the knockout stage if it\u2019s canceled.\n\nOnly two words will satisfy both teams when organizers make a final call on Sunday morning: game on.\n\n\u201cWe feel we\u2019ve played and won three test matches and that\u2019s put us in the best position to win this pool,\u201d Joseph said Friday. \u201cJust in the past few days through the media reports I\u2019ve read, I feel they\u2019ve undermined the achievements of the Japanese national team and the significance of Sunday\u2019s test for Japan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all earned the right to be considered one of the elite teams in the world. It\u2019s important for us to wake up on Monday morning and understand we\u2019re a worthy top eight team or we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nIf Ireland beats Samoa on Saturday - that was the only game not cancelled on that day - Scotland needs to win with a bonus point to edge Japan from a top-two finish in the group. The Scots lost 27-3 in their opening game to Ireland, who then were upset by Japan.\n\n\u201cThe key difference here between us and Scotland is that we\u2019re driven and supported by the whole country,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cMy team is motivated by achieving something great, not avoiding embarrassment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to remind everybody it hasn\u2019t been a fluke - this team has been in camp for 240 days this year alone.\u201d\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend said he\u2019s expecting the weather to be better on Sunday, anyway, and is confident the game will go ahead.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we have to put faith in,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played.\n\n\u201cI know the situation changes a lot but what we have been told is that Sunday looks clear now. Saturday is the day when the typhoon comes in, and it comes through quite quickly.\u201d\n\nJapan has never beaten Scotland, and it was a loss to the Scots that put them out of the 2015 World Cup in the group stage despite registering three wins - including the massive upset win over two-time champion South Africa.\n\nJapan frontrower Shota Horie thinks the schedule won\u2019t be further harmed by the typhoon that it already is, although he\u2019s not so confident about his property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a typhoon of quite a size so I want all the Japanese citizens to be careful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the match will go ahead, of course we\u2019ll win and progress to the last eight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about anything else, (although) I\u2019m worried whether my house will be all right.\u201d\n\nBoth lineups have been announced, so the pre-game formalities haven\u2019t been delayed.\n\nJoseph has given star winger Kenki Fukuoka a start after he has proved he\u2019s recovered from a calf muscle injury sustained five weeks ago.\n\nFukuoka was a late, forced inclusion in the reserves against Ireland and scored the match-winning try, and scored another try off the bench against Samoa last Saturday. He\u2019s back as a starter among four changes to the starting lineup.\n\nHooker Shota Horie, lock Luke Thompson, and fullback William Tupou are recalled.\n\nFukuoka, Horie, and Thompson, along with prop Keita Inagaki, captain Michael Leitch, flyhalf Yu Tamura and wing Kotaro Matsushima repeat as starters against Scotland from the 2015 Rugby World Cup match which the Scots won 45-10 to cost Japan a place in the quarterfinals.\n\nTownsend made 12 changes to his starting lineup, recalling seven players to the starting XV who were rested for the midweek win over Russia.\n\nSkipper Greig Laidlaw, veteran fullback Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell and Sam Johnson return in the backs, and forwards Allan Dell, Jonny Gray and Blade Thomson are back.\n\n____\n\nJapan: William Tupou, Kotaro Matsushima, Timothy Lafaele, Ryoto Nakamura, Kenki Fukuoka, Yu Tamura, Yutaka Nagare; Kazuki Himeno, Pieter Labuschagne, Michael Leitch (captain), James Moore, Luke Thompson, Jiwon Koo, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki.
