Sportsmail look at some of the standout statistics from Friday night's goal fest.\n\nRecords fell on Friday night as Leicester earned a thumping 9-0 win away to Southampton\n\nLeicester's nine away goals are more than Manchester United have scored on the road since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer became permanent manager almost seven months ago\n\nManchester United fans, look away now. United's performances on the road since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer got the job have been underwhelming. In their last two Europa League away contests, Solskjaer's side have failed to register a shot on target from open play.\n\nIn 90 minutes at St Mary's stadium, Leicester City scored more away goals than United have mustered since the Norwegian was permanently appointed seven months ago.\n\nThe Foxes also managed to score more away goals on Friday night than Derby County did for the duration of their dire 2007-08 Premier League campaign in which they only picked up 11 points.\n\nJamie Vardy and Ayoze Perez became the first team-mates to score a hat trick each in the Premier League since Arsenal duo Robert Pires and Jermaine Pennant in May 2003\n\nIt was the joint-largest winning margin in the league, tied with United's 9-0 win over Ipswich\n\nLeicester City keeper Kasper Schmeichel's father Peter played in that game at Old Trafford\n\nAfter 10 Premier League games Leicester sit in second place in the table on 20 points. Interestingly enough, that is one point more than the east Midlands side had at that stage on their way to their incredible title triumph in the 2015-16 season under Claudio Ranieri.\n\nFriday's result was the joint-largest ever margin of victory in Premier League history, alongside Manchester United's 9-0 win at home to Ipswich in March 1995.\n\nPeter Schmeichel, father of Leicester 'keeper Kasper, was between the sticks for that game.\n\nThe Foxes also have more points at this stage than they did when they won the league in 2016\n\nLeicester are also only the second team in the league's history to go into half time with a five-goal lead in an away fixture. Manchester City also lead by five goals in their away victory against Burnley in April 2010.\n\nVardy and Perez became the first players to score a hat trick on the same team since Arsenal duo Robert Pires and Jermaine Pennant in May 2003. Pires and Pennant's hat tricks also came against the Saints.\n\nFinally, Leicester's quick-fire three goals in the opening 19 minutes on Friday night was the fastest they have gone 3-0 ahead in a Premier League fixture since April 1998, where they took a three-goal lead against Derby County inside just eight minutes.", "description": "Hat tricks from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy contributed to a win that meant Brendan Rodgers' side recorded the biggest-ever away victory by an away side in an English top-flight league match.", "authors": ["Ollie Lewis For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/23/20199672-0-image-a-40_1572040925251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
