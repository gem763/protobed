USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In baseball's new era of big data, high-definition cameras and tablets in the dugout, pitch-tipping \u2013 and how teams decipher and share the information \u2013 has become less about gamesmanship and entered something of an ethical gray area.\n\nIt's a topic at the forefront this October after Tampa Bay Rays starter Tyler Glasnow acknowledged that he was tipping pitches in the ALDS and Houston Astros hitters could be seen seemingly relaying that information.\n\nThat would be just fine decades ago, but with the wealth of replays and angles available these days, where is the line?\n\n\"Everyone's got their own version of ethics,\" St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said when asked for his thoughts prior to Game 4 of the National League Championship Series on Tuesday.\n\nWashington Nationals starter Anibal Sanchez said he had an issue tipping pitches in 2012, but it's really up to the pitcher to make adjustments.\n\n\"If you show something different to hitters \u2013 as professional hitters \u2013 they're going to take advantage of that,\" Sanchez said.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who debuted in 2006, noted that times are changing and players have more tools at their disposal: \"Right now, it's a lot of technology in the clubhouse.\"\n\nA view of Nationals Park before Game 3 of the NLCS.

Not only under the guise of what pure competition looks like, but also how we represent our game to the public and most importantly to the young people that are playing.\"\n\nThe Cardinals manager also stressed the subjective interpretations of gamesmanship and competition.\n\n\"I'm no moralist and I don't know what that line looks like,\" Shildt said.\n\n\"There's a lot of gray in there, so my hope is that we're doing things within the game.\"", "description": "As technology and data dominate Major League Baseball, where is the line for studying opposing pitchers?", "authors": ["Jesse Yomtov", "Published P.M.
