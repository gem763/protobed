In lowering its policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a target range of between 1.50% and 1.75%, the U.S. central bank dropped a previous reference in its policy statement that it \"will act as appropriate\" to sustain the economic expansion - language that was considered a sign for future rate cuts. \u201cThat suggests that it\u2019s going to take a little bit more weakness from here on out for the Fed to lower rates, and really it\u2019s going to take quite a sustained turn for the worse in terms of trade discussions,\u201d said Bipan Rai, North American head of fx strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in Toronto. Comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in the press conference following the U.S. central bank's statement further boosted the notion that additional cuts in the near-term are unlikely. The current stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate and it would take a material reassessment in the outlook for the Fed to change its current stance, Powell said. The dollar index rose to 98.00 as Powell spoke, the highest since Oct. 17, before retracing back to 97.53, down 0.16% on the day. Broad expectations heading into the meeting that the Fed would adopt a more hawkish tone was seen as limiting dollar strength. \"By and large the market was positioned for a less dovish or a hawkish cut today, but there aren\u2019t any conclusive signals that the Fed is done just yet,\" Rai said. The dollar had briefly gained earlier on Wednesday after data showed that the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. The data \u201cpointed to below trend growth, but still relatively steady and pretty solid growth in the context of what\u2019s going on in the rest of the world,\u201d said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. Payrolls data for October released on Friday is the next major U.S. economic focus. The greenback also temporarily dipped on reports that Chile has withdrawn as host of an APEC trade summit in November where the United States and China had been expected to take major steps toward ending a 15-month-old trade war. Optimism that the U.S. and China will reach a deal has boosted risk sentiment this week. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 3:08PM (1908 GMT) Description RIC Last U.S. Close Pct Change YTD Pct High Bid Low Bid Previous Change Session Euro/Dollar EUR= $1.1135 $1.1110 +0.23% -2.91% +1.1138 +1.1081 Dollar/Yen JPY= 108.8100 108.8700 -0.06% -1.32% +109.2800 +108.8000 Euro/Yen EURJPY= 121.20 120.98 +0.18% -3.98% +121.2700 +120.8800 Dollar/Swiss CHF= 0.9898 0.9937 -0.39% +0.86% +0.9945 +0.9899 Sterling/Dollar GBP= 1.2892 1.2865 +0.21% +1.06% +1.2905 +1.2846 Dollar/Canadian CAD= 1.3174 1.3085 +0.68% -3.40% +1.3207 +1.3073 Australian/Doll AUD= 0.6887 0.6864 +0.34% -2.31% +0.6887 +0.6849 ar Euro/Swiss EURCHF= 1.1024 1.1045 -0.19% -2.04% +1.1049 +1.1015 Euro/Sterling EURGBP= 0.8634 0.8634 +0.00% -3.90% +0.8644 +0.8612 NZ NZD= 0.6367 0.6354 +0.20% -5.21% +0.6368 +0.6335 Dollar/Dollar Dollar/Norway NOK= 9.1996 9.2256 -0.28% +6.49% +9.2588 +9.1980 Euro/Norway EURNOK= 10.2446 10.2536 -0.09% +3.42% +10.2784 +10.2320 Dollar/Sweden SEK= 9.6745 9.7005 -0.06% +7.93% +9.7421 +9.6729 Euro/Sweden EURSEK= 10.7722 10.7790 -0.06% +4.95% +10.8210 +10.7705 (Editing by David Gregorio and Marguerita Choy)", "description": "* Fed cuts rates, but signals a pause * U.S. economy slowed less than expected in Q3 (Adds quote, updates prices) By Karen Brettell NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, reversing initial gains, after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for", "authors": ["Karen Brettell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AUwqkrugbZVQ8ilWCo.UEw--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/2c10b2e0-fb53-11e9-bd6f-832ae1c13b81", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
