Total will be the operator, with a 40% stake. Those areas, known as \u201cfringe blocks,\u201d are believed to share some geology with the pre-salt area.\n\nAfter the auction, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said the results were \u201cwell above expectations,\u201d pointing out that minimum signing bonus for all areas together combined was just 3.2 billion reais.\n\nOther significant winning bids included a bid of 1.116 billion reais by Petronas for a block in the Campos Basin, and a 2.045 billion reais bid from Brazil\u2019s Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and BP Plc (BP.L) for a separate block.\n\nPetronas made another significant move into Brazil in April, when it purchased two oilfields from state-run Petrobras for $1.29 billion.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L), Wintershall Dea GmbH, Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Repsol SA (REP.MC) also won at least minority stakes in exploration blocks.\n\nTwenty-four blocks, many in more marginal oil producing areas, failed to attract a bidder and will be placed in a new program the Brazilian government calls \u201cpermanent offer.\u201d\n\nSeven blocks near the ecologically sensitive Abrolhos archipelago in northeastern Brazil received no bids, after environmental litigation involving federal prosecutors was disclosed on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement following results, Total said that while it was committed to pursuing deepwater opportunities in Brazil, in would not join other oil majors in participating in the transfer-of-rights round as the competitive process was geared toward non-operating stakes.\n\nIn addition to the t10 companies that made successful bids in oil blocks, Norway\u2019s Equinor ASA (EQNR.OL) made one unsuccessful bid.\n\nSix companies \u2013 Murphy Oil Corp (MUR.N), Enauta Partipacoes SA ENAT3.SA, Karoon Energy Ltd (KAR.AX), Petrogal, Ecopetrol SA (ECO.CN) and China National Offshore Oil Corp Ltd (0883.HK) \u2013 registered for the auction but did not place offers.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Ten companies on Thursday agreed to pay more than $2 billion for the exploration and production rights in 12 offshore oil blocks in Brazil.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Oil-production-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
