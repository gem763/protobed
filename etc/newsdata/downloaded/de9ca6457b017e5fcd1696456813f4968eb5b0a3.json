Both moves are effective Oct. 1, the company said.\n\nThe changes in the finance function come roughly seven months after the closure of BlackBerry\u2019s acquisition of cybersecurity firm Cylance Inc. in February. Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry, once known for its hand-held devices, increasingly has shifted its business in recent years toward security software and services for enterprise clients.\n\nMr. Capelli will work alongside other business leaders to drive revenue growth, BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen said on a Tuesday earnings call. \u201cHe\u2019s uniquely qualified with a strong sales experience and knowledge of our market,\u201d Mr. Chen said, according to a transcript.\n\nMr. Capelli said his move was neither a promotion nor a demotion and that it wouldn\u2019t change the reporting structure of the company. As chief revenue officer, Mr. Capelli will coordinate revenue generation efforts across the company, especially for new product launches that are planned for later this year and next year, he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to put more focus on our revenue generation,\u201d Mr. Capelli told CFO Journal.\n\nThe creation of the new revenue chief position highlights some of the challenges the transition toward enterprise software presents for BlackBerry, said Ali Mogharabi, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc. In his new role, Mr. Capelli could speed up the process of closing deals with new commercial customers, Mr. Mogharabi said.\n\nThe company on Tuesday reported disappointing earnings, resulting in a slide in its share price. Shares closed down 22.7% at $5.81 Tuesday.\n\nRevenue in BlackBerry\u2019s Internet of Things division fell about 3% from a year earlier in its fiscal second quarter, and the company booked a loss of $43 million. Overall revenue rose 16% to $244 million, but adjusted revenue, a measure watched closely by analysts, fell below expectations.\n\nMr. Capelli brings significant operational experience to the new role, said Steven Fox, a managing director at Cross Research LLC. \u201cWith added senior leadership, they [BlackBerry] think they can be more effective,\u201d Mr. Fox said.\n\nBlackBerry is looking to expand its offerings to corporate customers in areas such as health care, adding to its existing focus on the financial services, automotive and public sectors, Mr. Fox said.\n\nMr. Rai, the new CFO, is expected to work on generating potential synergies from the Cylance acquisition as well as managing cash flow, analysts said.\n\n\u201cWe want to invest as much as possible while remaining cash-flow positive,\u201d Mr. Rai said in an interview. He declined to provide specific figures for BlackBerry\u2019s planned investments or its cash-flow target. \u201cWe are still planning to be cash-flow positive for the full year,\u201d he said.\n\nFree cash flow before expenses, restructuring costs and legal proceedings reached $17 million in the quarter ended Aug. 31, the company said. Cash generated from operations was $18 million and capital expenditures were $4 million, according to BlackBerry.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "BlackBerry Ltd. said Tuesday it is moving its current finance chief to the newly created position of chief revenue officer in an effort to boost revenue across the business.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-110446/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
