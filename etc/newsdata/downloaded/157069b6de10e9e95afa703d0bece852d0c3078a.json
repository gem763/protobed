Going forward, he wanted me to shoot more. He would take the time to show me techniques: how to shoot properly using the outside of your foot, for example. With crosses, he showed me you don\u2019t always have to whip it. How to pick someone out. It was always constructive criticism.\n\n\u2018Your pass had to be precise. You know how Arsenal play, but with Freddie everything had to be perfect. You know: finding the pocket on the half-turn, and playing high, rotating at the right time. When the players got that, it worked perfectly. In my opinion we couldn\u2019t be stopped when we got the plan right.\u2019\n\nMORE: Alexandre Lacazette tips Matteo Guendouzi to become world-class after sparkling Arsenal form\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Unai Emery tells Arsenal he is happy with squad ahead of January transfer window", "description": "Freddie Ljungberg is taking steps to make himself indispensable at Arsenal having been promoted to the senior coaching set-up during the summer.
