It's unclear whether the cancellation signals the judge is considering Powell's demands.\n\nThe explosive court document, filed last week, alleged that FBI agents manipulated official records of Flynn\u2019s 2017 interview that led to him being charged with lying to investigators.\n\nThe entire case against Flynn stemmed from the 2017 FBI interview, in which Flynn was asked about his conversations with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Flynn ultimately pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding those conversations during his interview, as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nPowell alleged in the court filings that FBI officials manipulated Flynn\u2019s FBI 302 \u2014 a form used by agents to report or summarize interviews. It is not clear who may have done the alleged editing, though ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok was involved in the original interview.\n\n\u201cThose changes added an unequivocal statement that \u2018Flynn stated he did not\u2019 \u2014 in response to whether Mr. Flynn had asked Kislyak to vote in a certain manner or slow down the UN vote [on sanctions],\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on the issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d\n\nPowell also alleged that agents added: \u201cor if Kislyak described any Russian response to a request by Flynn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat question and answer does not appear in the notes, yet it was made into a criminal offense,\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThe draft also shows that the agents moved a sentence to make it seem to be an answer to a question it was not.\u201d\n\nFLYNN LAWYER WANTS PROSECUTORS TO TURN OVER CELLPHONES FROM MYSTERIOUS PROFESSOR LINKED TO RUSSIA PROBE\n\nPowell also alleged that on Jan. 23, 2017 \u2013 the day before the FBI interviewed Flynn at the White House \u2013 \u201cthe upper echelon of the FBI met to orchestrate\u201d strategies that would have Flynn talk \u201cin such a way as to keep from alerting him from understanding that he was being interviewed in a criminal investigation of which he was the target.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn short, they planned to deceive him about the entire scenario, and keep him \u2018unguarded,\u2019\u201d Powell claimed.\n\nPowell went on to reference newly discovered text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page days following the publication of the salacious anti-Trump dossier; media leaks from the FBI and Justice Department; and details surrounding the unexpected recusal of the former judge overseeing the case, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras.\n\nProsecutors have strongly rejected claims they're hiding evidence, saying recently \"the government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter,\" including by providing Flynn with thousands of pages of documents.\n\nFederal prosecutors earlier this month called the defense's filings a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a response seeking guidance from the judge while raising concerns that Flynn's legal team is raising these objections even after a guilty plea.\n\n\"In an extraordinary reversal, the defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charge in this case,\" the federal prosecutors wrote. \"He makes this claim despite having admitted his guilt, under oath, before two federal judges (including this Court.)\"\n\n\"The defendant also argues--based almost entirely on evidence previously provided in discovery--that the government engaged in 'conduct so shocking to the conscience and so inimical to our system of justice that it requires the dismissal of the charges for outrageous government conduct,'\" they continued, saying that for the \"first time,\" Flynn's legal team is arguing the government had \"an obligation\" to provide evidence to him \"prior to charging him in a criminal case.\"\n\nThe federal prosecutors also criticized Flynn's team over process, arguing in their filing that \"issues may not be raised for the first time in a reply brief.\"\n\n\"In light of this minute order, it may be that the Court intends to strike any arguments or claims raised for the first time by the defendant in his Reply. And it may be that the Court plans to require the defendant to raise any new claims for relief in a properly pled motion to which the government can fully respond,\" they wrote.\n\nPowell\u2019s defense of Flynn has caused an escalating battle with the government, with Flynn\u2019s sentencing still up in the air for his guilty plea. The government said in late August that the case was ready for sentencing, after months of delay. Sullivan has set a Dec. 18 sentencing date, though it\u2019s unclear whether it could be pushed off again.", "description": "The federal judge presiding over the case of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has canceled a hearing scheduled for next week, citing his lawyers\u2019 latest motion\u00a0-- which made a slew of misconduct allegations against the government while seeking access to supposedly exculpatory evidence.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
