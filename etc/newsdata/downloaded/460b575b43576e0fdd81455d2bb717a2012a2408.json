Hudson London Anstead was born in the morning and weighs seven pounds and seven ounces, and is 19.5 inches long. Their son joins Christina\u2019s two kids, Taylor, 8, and Brayden, 4\u2014who she shares with ex-husband Tarek El Moussa\u2014and Ant\u2019s children, Amelie, 15, and Archie, 12, from a former marriage.\n\nThe Flip or Flop star announced the news via Instagram, happily sharing that she had delivered a \"healthy baby boy.\"\n\nAnt also posted the same photo, echoing his wife's joy. \"I am in awe! Mummy and baby are simply perfect!\" he wrote.\n\nChristina took to Instagram in early September to open up about the last leg of her pregnancy, specifically that she had decided to schedule a C-section.\n\n\u201cI chose to do this because I had an emergency c-section with Brayden and the whole experience and recovery was really hard on me physically and emotionally,\u201d she explained. \u201cI really don\u2019t feel comfortable trying to go down that route again. Bray was 8lbs 13oz\u2014after pushing for hours and hours\u2014he was just stuck and his heart rate was dropping. Based on ultrasound measurements we think this is going to be another big boy so this is the direction we\u2019ve decided to take.\u201d\n\nShe also admitted that she was \u201cnot sleeping, irritable, and uncomfortable,\u201d but that she couldn\u2019t wait to meet their \u201clittle man.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s here, we can\u2019t wait to see more photos of him.
