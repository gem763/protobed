Mitt Romney (R-UT) said during a Senate floor speech Thursday that President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and allegedly \u201cabandon the Kurds\u201d \u201cwill stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney, a frequent Republican critic of President Trump, lashed out at President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria. The failed 2012 Republican presidential candidate alleged the president stained America\u2019s honor on the world stage and gave Russia and Iran more power in the Middle East.\n\nRomney said:\n\nThe decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred duties. It strikes at American honor. What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a blood stain in the annals of American history. There are broad strategic implications of our decision as well. Iranian and Russian interests in the Middle East have been advanced by our decision at a time when we\u2019re applying maximum pressure on Iran. By giving them a stronger hand in Syria, we\u2019ve actually weakened that pressure. Russia\u2019s objective to play a greater role in the Middle East has also been greatly enhanced. The Kurds, out of desperation, have now aligned with Assad.\n\nFurther, Romney attacked the \u201cadministration,\u201d or President Trump, for speaking \u201ccavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty.\u201d\n\nSen. Romney even discounted President Trump\u2019s efforts to cease America\u2019s \u201cendless wars.\u201d\n\nThe Utah senator has been severely critical of President Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops from Kurdish-controlled areas of the Syria-Turkey border, although in 2007 Romney warned that \u201cKurdish nationalism could destabilize the border with Turkey.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite Romney\u2019s opposition to Trump\u2019s move to withdraw from Syria, Sens. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Mike Braun (R-IN) have backed Trump\u2019s efforts to put a stop to America\u2019s endless wars.\n\nSen. Paul blocked a Democrat-led effort to condemn Trump\u2019s Syria strategy.\n\nSen. Braun also led a Senate floor Thursday afternoon, suggesting that the president\u2019s cease-fire agreement with Turkey \u201cis proof\u201d that Trump \u201cmade the right decision.\n\n\u201cWe need more business-minded leaders like Trump in Washington to disrupt the status quo and deliver results,\u201d the Hoosier senator said.\n\n.@realDonaldTrump took a lot of unfair heat about withdrawing American troops from Syria, and this cease-fire agreement is proof that he made the right decision. We need more business-minded leaders like Trump in Washington to disrupt the status quo and deliver real results. \u2014 Senator Mike Braun (@SenatorBraun) October 17, 2019\n\nWe cannot keep fighting everyone's wars when we run trillion dollar deficits atop 22 trillion in debt back home. I'm glad President @realDonaldTrump is disentangling us from unwise conflicts in the Middle East.

We need more business-minded leaders like Trump in Washington to disrupt the status quo and deliver real results.\n\nIn an interview with Breitbart News Wednesday, Sen. Braun said that \u201conly neocons,\u201d or neoconservatives, oppose President Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria and that \u201cmain street Republicans\u201d back his America First foreign policy.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.
