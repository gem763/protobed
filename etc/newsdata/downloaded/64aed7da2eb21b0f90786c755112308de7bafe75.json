He received 14 stitches above his brow and sustained a black eye. The injury did not keep the 39th president from helping the nonprofit organization, Habitat for Humanity, to build a home in Tennessee.\n\n\u201cI had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses,\u201d Carter told a crowd earlier this month while addressing his brief hospital visit. Carter, the following day, participated in his 36th building project with Habitat for Humanity.\n\nCarter, whose birthday was Oct. 1, appeared at the building site with his left eye swollen and bruised. He wore a white bandage above his eye. His wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, 92, joined him.\n\nBefore construction began, Carter led a morning devotion for a group of several hundred volunteers.\n\nCarter said God gives all life and freedom. \"With our freedom, every one of us can make a basic decision. ... 'What kind of person do I, myself, choose to be?'\"\n\nHe said every person \"can be a complete success in the eyes of God.\"\n\nFORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL FOLLOWING HIP SURGERY\n\nCarter also suffered a fall at his home earlier this year, which resulted in a broken hip. The 39th president was given successful hip replacement surgery in Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Ga. Carter fell while leaving to go turkey hunting.\n\nThis year, Carter became the oldest living U.S. president, following the death of former President George H.W. Bush in November 2018.\n\nCarter served as president from 1977 to 1981 and has lived the longest after leaving office -- with January 20 of this year marking 38 years since he was succeeded by Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn August 2015, Carter announced that doctors had found melanoma in his brain and liver. He underwent radiation treatment and later announced, in December 2015, that he was cancer-free.\n\nFox News' David Lewkowict, Stephen Sorace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter was hospitalized after again falling at his home in Georgia, a spokesperson said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
