Experts on aging estimate nearly six million Americans currently live with Alzheimer and related dementias and their treatments cost some $290 billion annually\n\nThe new study was conducted at Michigan State University and is among the first such population-based U.S. research of variations in dementia diagnoses based on marital status.\n\nThe study sample consisted of 15,379 respondents \u2014 6,650 men and 8,729 women. All were at least 52 years old in 2000 and symptom-free and examined every two years.\n\nResearchers closely looked at four categories of non-marrieds \u2014 separated/divorced, co-habiters, widowed and never married. The divorced came out the worst for dementia.\n\nThe study\u2019s head researcher, Hui Liu, noted, \u201cMarital status is an important but overlooked social risk/protective factor for dementia.\u201d\n\nShe added:\n\nThis research is important because the number of unmarried older adults in the United States continues to grow, as people live longer and their marital histories become more complex.\n\nOther studies have shown that unmarried individuals have a higher risk of death from heart disease. One of those authors, Dr. Arshed Quyyumisaid, of Emory University said:\n\nI was somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the influence of being married has. Social support provided by marriage, and perhaps many other benefits of companionship, are important for people with heart disease.\n\nThat companionship theme may have some under-appreciated health advantages. Previous studies have shown that owning a pet like a dog can extend human lifespans by promoting more social interaction and physical activity and reducing depression.\n\nElderly people with dogs, especially single elderly, were 33 percent less likely to die early.
