Linked to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, staking is the process of holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network, basically consisting of locking cryptocurrencies to receive rewards.\n\nThe report finds that staking is increasingly popular, and that at the moment, it accounts for USD 8 billion in crypto activity, while USD 15.4 billion of all crypto tokens can be staked. However, the second largest network by market capitalization, Ethereum, introducing its long-coming staking, will be a game changer as the volume of staking activity \u201cwill more than double,\u201d according to the reasearchers. With Ethereum\u2019s \u201cimpending\u201d switch to PoS from Proof-of-Work (PoW), which is expected to happen in \u201cthe not-too-distant-future,\u201d Binance Research adds, \u201cstaking is expected to take a most substantial portion of the market\u2019s attention.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cas more infrastructure players support staking, the entire ecosystem will be able to mature,\u201d and \u201cthe blockchain space may be forced to reckon with staking sooner, rather than later.\u201d\n\nAs of October 24th, the report states, the largest 10 networks supporting or planning on supporting staking \u201crepresent a cumulative market capitalization of USD 25.8 billion,\u201d the largest of them being Etherum. On the other hand, excluding Ethereum, the cumulative staking market capitalization is worth some USD 11.2 billion with around USD 6.4 billion being staked, Binance Research concludes.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Staking Rewards, a website that tracks 65 yield-bearing assets, claims that this capitalization stands at almost USD 13 billion today and USD 7 billion worth of assets is being currently locked in staking.\n\nTop 10 stakeable assets ranked by staking rewards\n\nSource: Staking Rewards\n\nAnother relevant point made in the report is that other projects may be inspired by ETH to make the switch. With Ethereum Classic (ETC) rooted in PoW, \u201cEthereum has many research camps developing various staking-powered mechanisms.\u201d Additionally, the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum stakeholders have funded nearly USD 10 million worth of grants for the much-discussed Ethereum 2.0, which is meant to solve major issues such as scalability. \u201cWith Ethereum being the second-largest market cap coin and one of the longest-running blockchain products, it could drive many projects to follow and switch to Proof-of-Stake,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\nAt pixel time (10:26 UTC), ETH trades at c. USD 188 and is up by 2.7% in the past 24 hours and by 8% in the past week.\n\n__\n\nLearn more:\n\nDecentralized Lending Soars, Staking Gains Traction\n\nConsidering Third-Party Staking Services?
