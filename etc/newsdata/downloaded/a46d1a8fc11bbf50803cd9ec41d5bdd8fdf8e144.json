You have overstepped,\u201d the rightfully frustrated dad said.\n\nThe radical sex education policy will provide graphic instruction on gender identity and mandated support of the LGBT movement.\n\nStudents in grade school and middle school will also be taught how to get an abortion or obtain birth control pills without parental permission or consent.\n\nThe school district will also begin instructing students to no longer use words like \u201cmother\u201d or \u201cfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse gender inclusive language,\u201d the district\u2019s material mandates. \u201cIt is important to avoid terms which refer to only \u2018male\u2019 or \u2018female\u2019 identities when speaking with young children as this can limit their understanding of gender into binaries and can exclude children who may not identify within these identities.\u201d\n\nThe district\u2019s curriculum recommends \u201cintegrating\u201d words like parents or guardians instead of mom or dad.\n\nTexas Values, one of the state\u2019s leading family advocacy groups, warned that the Austin ISD was sending a message that people of faith are no longer welcome in the school district.\n\n\u201cAustin ISD has broken the sacred trust between school and parent,\u201d Texas Values spokesman David Walls said in a statement. \u201cAustin parents have no reason to entrust their children to a school district that welcomes sex criminals and sexually explicit materials in the school.\u201d\n\nTo force this kind of pornography on school children is nothing more than government-sanctioned child abuse. The district\u2019s policy is all about grooming children for sex.\n\nAs one parent declared, \u201cThe curriculum is an attack on Christianity and family and on parental rights.\u201d\n\nMore than 100 citizens spoke at Monday night\u2019s district meeting and the overwhelming majority were opposed to the policy.\n\nThose speaking on behalf of the plan included a 9-year-old child, a fourth-grader, the parent of a transgender second grader, a lady who identified by the pronoun \u201cthey/them\u201d and some gal wearing a t-shirt that read, \u201cI met God. They\u2019re queer, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nBut I knew the fix was in before the debate even commenced. A good many of the district trustees had already planted LGBT and transgender flags on their desks.\n\nSadly, the sex and gender revolutionaries have already commandeered a number of public schools around the nation. Instead of teaching our kids math and science they are trying to convince little boys that they are really little girls.\n\nI write about this stealth attack on our children in my new book, \u201cCulture Jihad: How to Stop the Left From Killing a Nation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s really no polite way to say this, folks. But if freedom-loving, church-going patriots do not reclaim our public schools \u2013 we will lose the Republic.\n\nAUTHOR\u2019S NOTE: Click here for a free subscription to Todd\u2019s weekly newsletter: a must read for freedom-loving conservatives!", "description": "The sex and gender revolutionaries have officially taken over the .10/29/2019 11:05:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/302/245c649d-51ff-42a6-9450-89ce19a84077.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
