The shiny silverware and white linens. Enjoying thick slices of French toast covered with powdered sugar and drenched in syrup while taking in the scenery. The friends made over a slice of cheesecake.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something fantastic about dinner in the dining car,\u201d said Keely, 32, a writer from Brasstown, N.C., who swears by the Amtrak crab cake and steak dinner. \u201cYou get to meet other people and hear so many great stories. It is to me one of the best parts about traveling.\u201d\n\nThat experience is about to change. Amtrak says it is reinventing its dining service on long-distance trains, killing the traditional dining car to create more \u201cflexible\u201d and \u201ccontemporary\u201d dining options.\n\nThe carrier says the change, starting this fall on the one-night routes east of the Mississippi River, is driven by the desire to save money and lure a younger generation of new riders \u2014 chiefly, millennials known to be always on the run, glued to their phones and not particularly keen on breaking bread with strangers at a communal table.\n\nWith the transition, Amtrak is doing away with the traditional onboard kitchen, switching to serving prepackaged meals and easing restrictions on the traditional serving times. The change allows the railroad to cut costs associated with cooking aboard and keeping up with the white-tablecloth service that was once known to rival high-end restaurants and clubs.\n\n[Amtrak will launch nonstop service between Washington, D.C., and New York]\n\nAmtrak isn\u2019t labeling the change the end of the dining car, but rather an evolution more in line with the demands of this era.\n\n\u201cIt is part of an evolution,\u201d said Peter Wilander, who oversees Amtrak\u2019s customer experience. \u201cThe concept is to provide service the way our customers want rather than have everybody conform to one service delivery.\n\n\u201cSome people really like (the dining car) and view it as sort of a nostalgic train experience,\u201d Wilander said. \u201cSome people, especially our new millennial customers, don\u2019t like it so much. They want more privacy, they don\u2019t want to feel uncomfortable sitting next to people\u201d they don\u2019t know.\n\nIt\u2019s that demographic, he said, that Amtrak wants to attract with more contemporary car designs and food options.\n\n\n\nHarrison Keely and his mother, Sherrie Keely, enjoy dessert in an Amtrak dining car in June. (Courtesy of Harrison Keely)\n\nFor now, the changes are only on Amtrak\u2019s one-night routes on the East Coast. The \u201cflexible\u201d dining service for sleeping car customers starts Oct. 1 on the Cardinal (New York-Chicago), City of New Orleans (Chicago-New Orleans), Crescent (New York-New Orleans) and Silver Meteor (New York-Miami). The shift will happen next year on the Silver Star \u2014 another New York-Miami service.\n\nFor passengers, it will be the end of the freshly prepared meals aboard. No more eggs over easy or the favorite Railroad French toast. No more steak cooked to their liking. Travelers will no longer need to make reservations for the breakfast, lunch and dinner service hours.\n\nPassengers in roomettes and bedrooms, considered premium riders, will have the choice to have meals delivered to their rooms. If desired, they will be able to use a new version of a dining car, open exclusively to them, with booths, but no white linens. Eventually, Amtrak said, it may get rid of the booths altogether and create a more contemporary lounge setting.\n\nThe new menu offers a variety of prepackaged meals; for example, red wine braised beef and chicken fettuccine. In the morning, passengers will be able to pick up a pastry and coffee from a buffet-style continental breakfast.\n\nCoach riders will eventually be able to buy the meals offered to premium riders, but in the cafe car.\n\n[Amtrak adds additional Saturday service]\n\nWilander said the food standards aren\u2019t taking a hit, but rather, he said, the meals will be more consistent while the ingredients remain of \u201chigh quality.\u201d He said the process of preordering and preselecting meals will allow Amtrak to maintain tighter controls of inventory, resulting in savings.\n\nThe railroad anticipates the change will save it about $2 million a year.\n\nAmtrak began testing boxed meals on its Crescent trains. Last year it eliminated full meals and introduced the \u201cmore contemporary\u201d dining menu on the Capitol Limited (D.C.-Chicago) and Lake Shore Limited (Chicago-New York). Since then it has tweaked the menu based on customer feedback. Officials, learned, for example, that the public\u2019s perception of food boxes wasn\u2019t as favorable as it hoped, and that passengers wanted more hot food options.\n\n\n\nA dining car on the Amtrak Crescent awaits travelers in March.

Eventually, Wilander said, riders will be able to pick their meal online, ahead of their trip.\n\nThe new dining options are part of Amtrak\u2019s larger vision for long-distance trains. In coming months it will be refreshing train interiors, replacing old cloth-covered seats with faux leather cushions that provide lumbar support. It will update bedding, towels and linens for sleeping cars, and debut new Viewliner II sleeping cars for trains on the East Coast, the first addition to its sleeper fleet in more than 25 years.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t forgotten the long distance,\u201d said Roger Harris, executive vice president of marketing and revenue, citing improvements he said will enhance the overnight travel experience.\n\n[Plan for Long Bridge expansion moves forward]\n\nBut the decision to scrap the traditional dining car has drawn criticism from rail aficionados, and inspired a petition \u2014 signed by about 400 people as of Thursday \u2014 urging the railroad to keep the dining car service on all long-distance trains.\n\nThese travelers say the dining car is iconic to the rail experience. While it has changed over the decades, becoming more casual with the transition from fancy china to disposable plastic plates and bowls, it remains a favorite of many.\n\n\n\nNew dining options Amtrak will be serving aboard their updated train service include Creole shrimp and andouille sausage. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\nKeely\u2019s mother, Sherrie Keely, who grew up traveling by train, said she still remembers the days when Amtrak had cloth napkins, flowers on the table and a little silver teapot.\n\n\u201cIt is probably one of the few places that you can travel and sit down and talk to people,\u201d she said. While some may find the prepackaged meals convenient, she says they encourage people to seclude themselves in their roomettes and discourage one-on-one time with other travelers at the dining table.\n\n\u201cOf course with those boxed lunches there is no waiting time in between,\u201d she said. That takes away the quiet time to sit down and enjoy a meal with friends.\n\nHer son Harrison took his first Amtrak trip when he was a baby in a stroller.\n\nThe memories of every trip \u2014 from the 1996 trip to his grandparents\u2019 50th wedding anniversary in Philadelphia to this summer\u2019s trip to Washington for his grandmother\u2019s 93rd birthday \u2014 all include a meal in the dining car.\n\n\n\nNew dining options include pasta and meatballs on the kid's menu. (Evelyn Hockstein/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid, I loved having the Railroad French toast for breakfast on Amtrak. . . . My favorite meal aboard Amtrak now is the crab cake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt comes with a steak, but I don\u2019t eat much red meat, so I give it to another diner at the table. Recently another diner offered to order the same thing and swapped with me so I could have two crab cakes.\u201d\n\nBut his fondness for the dining car isn\u2019t about the food as much as the experience, he said. The time to sit down for a formal meal with views of America that can\u2019t be seen while flying, and socializing with other travelers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an amazing American tradition,\u201d Keely said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful rhythm in clacking down the tracks and an excitement in traversing a moving train,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that feels special, unique, romantic even about having dinner in the diner, sleeping on the tracks and traveling America the way it used to be seen.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nExpanding the Long Bridge is key to region\u2019s growing rail needs, officials say\n\nUnion Station prepares for a concourse makeover", "description": "America\u2019s railroad is launching new menus and upgraded accommodations in its place on some of its long-distance trains.", "authors": ["Luz Lazo", "Transportation Reporter Covering Washington'S Metro", "Buses", "Capital Bikeshare", "Taxis", "The Region'S Road Network", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/d8_thiH_Az0QgQKJcUzit2f0xyU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FNVBPPGZOII6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
