Alexei Arkhipovich Leonov, artist, leader, spacewalker and friend, I salute you.\u201d\n\nNASA and the European Space Agency both praised the pioneering cosmonaut.\n\n\u201cHis venture into the vacuum of space began the history of extravehicular activity that makes today\u2019s @Space_Station maintenance possible,\u201d NASA said on Twitter.\n\nLeonov became a legend at home and his feats were immortalised in cinema and literature.\n\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d included recordings of Leonov\u2019s breathing in space.\n\nThe 1965 mission was also celebrated in a 2017 Russian film \u201cThe Spacewalker\u201d where Leonov acted as consultant.\n\nA crater on the far side of the Moon was named after Leonov in 1970.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Earth was beautiful\u2019 \u2013\n\nBorn in Siberia, the youngest of eight children, Leonov became a fighter pilot before being selected as one of the first potential cosmonauts. He was a friend of Yuri Gagarin, who became the first man in space in 1961 and trained with him.\n\nHe was selected to perform the first spacewalk as the Soviet Union and United States, Cold War foes, were locked in a frantic race to conquer space.\n\nAfter 18 months of intensive training Leonov was ready to become the first man to float in space.\n\nOn March 18, 1965, at the age of 30, he made history when he left a spacecraft during the Voskhod 2 mission for a spacewalk that lasted 12 minutes and nine seconds.\n\n\u201c(There was) an inky black, stars everywhere and the sun so bright I could barely stand it,\u201d Leonov told AFP in 2015 interview when he was a sprightly 80-year-old.\n\nTethered to the craft with a five-metre (16-foot) long cord, he gazed in wonder at Earth\u2019s geography laid out sweepingly below him.\n\n\u201cI filmed the Earth, perfectly round, the Caucasus, Crimea, the Volga. It was beautiful.\u201d\n\nLeonov and another cosmonaut, pilot Pavel Belyayev, orbited at a distance of 500 kilometres (310 miles) from Earth.\n\nThey completed the first ever spacewalk 10 weeks before the United States repeated the feat.\n\nTheir mission was declared successful even though Leonov experienced several mishaps.\n\nTheir return to Earth nearly ended in tragedy when Leonov and Belyayev were forced to crash land in a forest some 180 kilometres (111 miles) from the Urals city of Perm.\n\nThe crew was discovered four hours later and rescued only in two days as it was an ordeal to reach them.\n\n\u2013 Tribute in outer space \u2013\n\nA decade later in 1975 Leonov commanded the Soyuz 19 spacecraft which docked with the US Apollo spacecraft in the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and the United States.\n\nLeonov celebrated his 85th birthday on May 30 and cosmonauts Kononenko and Alexei Ovchinin dedicated a May spacewalk to him, taking a picture of him into space and wearing spacesuits with birthday greetings written on the back.\n\nPutin also congratulated Leonov at the time, calling him \u201ca worthy representative of the legendary team of Soviet cosmonauts\u201d.\n\nLeonov was an accomplished artist and writer and his contemporaries described him as warm and likable. He is survived by his widow Svetlana and his younger daughter Oksana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge tragedy for us all,\u201d said the wife of fellow cosmonaut Boris Volynov, Tamara Volynova.\n\n\u201cAlexei is a unique person,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nHe helped many cosmonauts and was a \u201cgreat storyteller\u201d, space historian Alexander Glushko said.\n\nHe also helped US astronaut Tom Stafford adopt two Russian boys.\n\nLeonov will be laid to rest at a cemetery just outside Moscow on Tuesday.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Alexei Leonov, a legendary Soviet cosmonaut who was the first man to perform a spacewalk in 1965, died in Moscow on Friday aged 85", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/fe78f2_tributes-poured-in-alexei-leonov-man-perform-spacewalk-dies-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
