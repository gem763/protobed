The other image shows the Mk1 bottom half, now finned up, apparently getting ready for a big construction milestone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk added that the Mk1 fairing, which is the protective \"nose cone\" that surrounds payloads during launch, will be mounted by Saturday. This means the billionaire entrepreneur will likely have a fully-stacked Mk1 as his backdrop when he makes his presentation.\n\nThe Raptor is the next-generation engine that will power Starship and Super Heavy. Both the Mk1 and the Mk2, which is another prototype that SpaceX is developing at its Florida facilities, will have at least three Raptors, Musk has said.\n\nThe Mk1 and Mk2 are second-generation Starship prototypes. The first \u2013 a large vehicle known as Starhopper - has just a single Raptor. On August 27, it completed its second untethered test flight, which took the craft about 500 feet into the air before landing safely. The Starhopper was then retired.\n\nSpaceX will aim to fly the Mk1 vehicle to an altitude of around 12 miles in October, then try out an orbital test flight shortly thereafter, according to Musk.\n\nThe first operational Starship-Super Heavy flight could occur as early as 2021, according to SpaceX representatives. The initial commercial launches will likely loft communications satellites, but passenger flights may not be far behind: Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has already booked a round-the-moon Starship mission, with a departure date scheduled for 2023.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOXBUSINESS.COM", "description": "Elon Musk will unveil his latest designs for SpaceX's vehicle that will travel to the moon and mars.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/AP19135037698674.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
