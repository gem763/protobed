In a note to investors, the firm upgraded both ride-hailing companies to Buy on lower subsidies and potential product innovation, contending that \u201cthe price is right to take the ride.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe both Lyft and Uber will have to address inefficient cost structures and focus on profitable growth. Higher prices, lower subsidies and slower growth in bookings will likely be the new normal, but these changes should help reduce losses over the next several years,\u201d wrote HSBC analyst Masha Kahn.\n\nDespite the hype surrounding the market debuts of both companies, many analysts have questioned whether they will ever be profitable. However, HSBC notes that on both fronts, management\u2019s rhetoric has become more focused on the path to profitability and costs.\n\n\u201cWhen backed by private capital, Uber and Lyft had the luxury of focusing on growth, now both are rethinking capital allocation. Being a public company has led to rationalization of competitive behavior in the U.S. ride-hailing sector,\u201d added Khan.\n\nIn its most recent earnings call, Lyft cofounder and CEO Logan Green called its Q2 \u201ca milestone quarter\u201d in its path to profitability. Similarly, Uber CFO Nelson Chai told investors the company continues \u201cto focus on balancing investments and profitability improvement\u201d and that \u201cprofitability of the rides business will prove out.\u201d\n\nFor Uber specifically, HSBC believes that investors are essentially getting a \u201cfree\u201d option on Uber Eats at the current share price. The firm says it sees \u201csigns of rationalization of Uber Eats\u2019 global footprint, which should help reduce losses from markets that are very competitive (India and South Korea) and focus on markets where growth opportunity is more attractive (Japan, Middle East and Latin America).\u201d\n\nAn Uber Eats food delivery courier pulls a bicycle in central Kiev, Ukraine September 9, 2019.

Notably, ride-hailing company Yandex Taxi and food delivery company Meituan Dianping in China. Analysts at the firm single out players such as Grubhub (GRUB), Delivery Hero (DHER.DE) and Just Eat (JE.L), which have outperformed Uber and Lyft in the last 3 months.\n\nDespite HSBC\u2019s bullish call on Uber and Lyft, the firm lowered its target prices on both stocks by $5. The firm now has a $44 price target on Uber shares, and $62 on Lyft. Both imply more than a 30% upside.\n\nLooking ahead, Uber\u2019s lock-up period is set to expire on November 6. Lyft\u2019s lock-up period was scheduled to end on September 24, but was unexpectedly moved up to August 19.\n\nPamela Granda is a producer for Yahoo Finance's live closing bell show, The Final Round.
