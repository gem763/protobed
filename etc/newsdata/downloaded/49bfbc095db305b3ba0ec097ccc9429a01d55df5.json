Now, with summer on the wane and winter looming, Cadillac is finally filling in the blanks on how the trim and powertrain particulars will sort out when the order books open later this year. The CT4, you'll remember, is essentially a rebodied and updated version of the previous ATS sedan that now sits under the CT5 and CT6 in Caddy's sedan portfolio.\n\nThe CT4-V, or \"V-series CT4,\" as Cadillac sometimes refers to it, will be joined by three additional trim levels: Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport. All share the same Alpha rear-wheel-drive platform (AWD is available across the lineup), and the defining elements come down to powertrain, suspension, cosmetic, and technology options and variations.\n\nA turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder joins lineup as a supporting player to the turbocharged 2.7-liter inline-four fitted to the CT4-V. Rated at 237 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and relying on an eight-speed automatic transmission for gear swaps, the 2.0-liter is standard kit on the Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport trims. It wears a \"350T\" badge in accordance with Cadillac's new torque-based naming scheme, as 258 lb-ft corresponds to 350 newton-meters of torque.\n\nPhoto credit: Cadillac More\n\nBuyers looking for a little additional grunt can spec the available 2.7-liter four-cylinder and 10-speed automatic in the Premium Luxury trim, with one caveat: to maintain the pecking order, the 2.7-liter in the Premium Luxury is detuned slightly to 309 horsepower and 348 lb-ft of torque in comparison to the beefy 325 hp and 380 lb-ft it produces in the CT4-V. Active Fuel Management, automatic stop/start, and a three-step sliding camshaft design provide both engines with the potential for improved efficiency.\n\nFour drive modes\u2014Tour, Sport, Snow/Ice, and Track\u2014are said to alter the calibrations for transmission shifting, steering and brake feel, front/rear torque split with AWD, vehicle sound characteristics, and other vehicle attributes as well as the suspension\u2014when equipped with the adaptive dampers, we assume. However, Cadillac hasn't yet detailed the specific parameters as they relate to each trim. A new \"My\" mode lets drivers personalize their settings, and the V-series has a V mode, which is presumably is the most aggressive.\n\nAll trims share the same front-strut-type independent rear suspension, but rear-wheel-drive versions of the V-series car get GM's lauded Magnetic Ride Control 4.0 active damping and a mechanical limited-slip rear differential. Bosch supplies the electric power steering with variable assist; the CT4-V gets specific calibration.\n\nSpeaking of turning, the turning radius is 37.1 feet with rear-wheel drive and 38.0 feet with all-wheel drive. Braking hardware gets divvied up accordingly: The Luxury and Premium Luxury trims get 11.8-inch front rotors, while the Sport and CT4-V trims have 12.6-inch front rotors with Brembo six-piston fixed front calipers. All trims get 12.4-inch rear rotors.\n\nWheel and tire matchups include 17-inch aluminum wheels with 225/45 all-season Continental self-sealing tires on the Luxury, 18-inch aluminum wheels with your choice of 235/40 all-season or self-sealing run-flat tires on the Premium Luxury, and 235/40 all-season run-flat tires on the Sport. A set of 235/40 summer performance tires is standard on the V-series, but the buyers may specify the all-season run-flats with all-wheel-drive models.", "description": "Luxury, Premium Luxury, and Sport trims join the previously announced CT4-V.", "authors": ["Andrew Wendler"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8vJHnxiAD0qMX6fe.HMM7A--~B/aD03MTY7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/09eb120d2ac4af290f56befe273a5b1c", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
