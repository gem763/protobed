I\u2019ve done lots of research into the science surrounding autism.\n\n\u201cBut other parents could have been taken advantage of, which is horrible. Many are vulnerable and all they want to do is protect their kids. Some are surviving on benefits caring for their children.\u201d\n\nThe Silica Waters website says it has \u201canecdotal testimonials\u201d from parents who say the water has been of \u201csignificant benefit\u201d.\n\nThe site also flags up research which claims a link between autism and high levels of aluminium in the brain, and suggests the water can reduce aluminium levels in the body.\n\nThe blurb also suggests other health benefits of drinking silica-rich water regularly include helping MS.\n\nBut a People probe revealed that the scientist who wrote the papers the company relies upon is controversial academic Professor Chris Exley, who works at Keele University, Staffordshire.\n\nA GoFundMe page to raise funds for Prof Exley was banned amid claims it was promoting \u201cmisinformation about vaccines\u201d.\n\n(Image: Gabriel Szabo/Guzelian)\n\nHe claimed in a scientific journal that tiny amounts of aluminium in jabs like the MMR are linked to autism.\n\nAnd he was once funded by the Children\u2019s Medical Research Council, linked to the notorious US anti-vaxx lobby.\n\nThe university has distanced itself from his findings, saying in June it \u201cemphatically supports the NHS policy of vaccination\u201d.\n\nBut Silica Waters is now pushing his theory that aluminium, found in everyday items such as tea and deodorants, can cause major neurological issues.\n\nWhen approached by the People, Garratt said: \u201cWe keep getting wonderful messages saying, \u2018please keep this water flowing because it\u2019s made such a difference to our child\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed he originally pledged 10 per cent of profits to Exley\u2019s research \u2013 but the academic asked him to stop after he gave an initial \u00a3300 to Keele University.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt came to the professor\u2019s attention it could be suggested he had a vested interest in the product.\u201d\n\nThere is no suggestion Exley personally profited from cash given to his projects by Silica Waters. But Garratt is still asking for research donations to Exley\u2019s research on the website.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are on good terms and share his research developments with our customers to keep them up to speed.\u201d\n\n(Image: Darren Cool)\n\nSilica Waters, which operates as a trading name of Garratt\u2019s PR firm, Link Us, sent an unsolicited message to Emma\u2019s autism support group.\n\nA rep said: \u201cLots of parents of autistic children tell us how our water has such positive effects on their children. Please note we also send free introductory samples to support groups.\u201d\n\nWhen 43-year-old Emma, mum to Damien, 12, and Skylar, seven, asked them to explain how the water\n\nEmma, from Plumstead, South London, then said: \u201cWe have so many families that would benefit. Have you had any children cured of all symptoms of autism?\u201d\n\nAnd she says the rep replied: \u201cMany parents, some from other support groups, find improvements and write to us about this. Yes.\u201d\n\nGarratt and Latham denied telling parents their water could cure autism when we quizzed them.\n\nGarratt, who worked in PR for the Malaysian tourist board, said: \u201cThe word yes would be taken out of context if it was suggested that reply was, \u2018yes, this cures symptoms of autism\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019d never say that because we have close relationships with many parents and they\u2019d be happy to share with you that under no circumstances would we ever suggest this water can cure autism.\u201d\n\nLatham added: \u201cWe are super-careful and don\u2019t make unsubstantiated claims.\n\nWe say many people have told us it helps them.\u201d But asked if she personally thought the water could cure autism, she said: \u201cI\u2019ve got an open mind and so has Rex.\u201d\n\nGarratt, 70, from Hove, East Sussex, cites Exley\u2019s research extensively.\n\nHis site states: \u201cProf Exley\u2019s research has shown a hypothesis linking aluminium accumulation in the body and neurological conditions, and revealed ... silica water removes aluminium from the body. Silica is also known to help promote softer skin, shinier hair and supple joints.\u201d\n\nBut small print stresses: \u201cThe link between aluminium neurotoxicity and neurological conditions remains a hypothesis.\u201d\n\nExley \u2013 pictured with Garratt in 2017, holding a bottle of his water \u2013 last night insisted he had \u201cno connection\u201d to Silica Waters.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve shown if you drink anything rich in silicon it removes aluminium from your body.\n\n\"If other people interpret that to mean aluminium is the cause of autism and removing it could help, that\u2019s their interpretation.\n\n\u201cSilica Waters contacted us at Keele to offer 10 percent of profits, to fund research. My university turned that down.\n\nWe received one donation for \u00a3340-odd.\u201d Exley said the crowdfunding was set up by a third party without his knowledge, adding: \u201cKeele does not allow crowdfunding projects.\u201d\n\nAnd responding to criticism from fellow academics, he said: \u201cName me an academic who is qualified in any way to criticise what we have done.\u201d\n\n'No evidence for irresponsible claims'\n\n(Image: Phil Harris)\n\nAutism experts have criticised claims silica-rich water can help autistic kids.\n\nDorothy Bishop, a neuropsychology professor at Oxford University, said: \u201cThere is no research evidence supporting the idea silica water is beneficial for autism and it is irresponsible to be promoting it.\u201d\n\nJonathan Green, a psychiatry \u00adprofessor from Manchester University who specialises in autism, agreed there was \u201cabsolutely no basis\u201d for the idea that silica water could cure or halt the \u00adsymptoms of autism.\n\nHe added: \u201c[Exley] is well known for these claims, that have no basis.\u201d\n\nMr Green said Exley should \u201cvery definitely\u201d declare his links to the \u00adcompany in his papers and called into question his bid to crowdfund research.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s unusual and suggests he can\u2019t put forward a good scientific case for other forms of funding. The concern is it bypasses the peer review and critical assessment phases, which act as a check.\u201d\n\nExley claims the bid was launched by someone else without his knowledge.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Two university professors say there is no scientific evidence to support the company's claims their product has beneficial effects for autism sufferers", "authors": ["Geraldine Mckelvie", "Image", "Gabriel Szabo Guzelian", "Darren Cool", "Phil Harris"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20730198.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Phil-HarrisDaily-Mirror.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
