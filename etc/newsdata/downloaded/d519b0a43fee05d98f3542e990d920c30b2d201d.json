He is 3-2 with a 0.64 ERA in five career postseason games, with four starts, and has allowed just 19 hits in 28 innings with 38 strikeouts and four walks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said this before,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that you train for, you dream about as a kid and you want to have those opportunities to just see how your stuff stacks up. When you\u2019re in the moment and stuff it\u2019s a great feeling, just going out there and competing against the best.\u201d\n\nStrasburg\u2019s best wasn\u2019t always there in the past for the Nationals.\n\nHe was famously shut down late in the 2012 season after he had come back from elbow reconstruction surgery. The Nationals lost in Game 5 at home of the NLDS that year to the St. Louis Cardinals as Gio Gonzalez started and the Nationals lost leads of 6-0 and 7-5.\n\n\u201cTry not to look in the past, try not to look in the future, really just try and be in the moment,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cOnce you start thinking about how things could have been or what things might happen, it takes your focus away from what your job is.\u201d\n\nStrasburg didn\u2019t pitch in 2016 after Sept. 7 due to an injury and the Nationals lost in five games, again, to the Dodgers, who won the clincher at Nationals Park.\n\nThe right-hander started and won Game 4 of the NLDS in 2017 over the Chicago Cubs. But the Nationals lost Game 5 at home as Max Scherzer came out of the bullpen and was tagged with the loss after Gio Gonzalez started and lasted just three innings.\n\nNationals pitching coach Paul Menhart, who took the job in early May, did not rule out using Max Scherzer out of the bullpen Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt would be worth discussing with him,\u201d Menhart told The Washington Times late Monday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it totally out.\u201d\n\nBut the Nationals hope Strasburg can go deep into the game after a stellar campaign.\n\nHe won a career-high 18 games in the regular season and posted a 3.32 ERA in 33 starts.\n\nStrasburg pitched three scoreless innings out of the bullpen in the wild card win over the Milwaukee Brewers on Oct. 1.\n\nOn Friday, he was masterful, giving up just one run on three hits in six innings to beat the Dodgers in Game 2. Strasburg fanned 10 batters with no walks in that outing.\n\nThe Nationals have come back all season, from starting the year 19-31 to rallying from a deficit in the wild card game to their win Monday over the Dodgers.\n\nWithout mentioning the name of Bryce Harper, Strasburg pointed out the Nationals have excelled this season even after losing the All-Star outfielder via free agency to the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s funny because like you go into the season and obviously, we lost a major part of the franchise in the offseason,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cBut I think it just showed the makeup that we have as an organization and to get back there and to be in a similar situations in the past, to have an another opportunity to move on, when you appreciate it a lot more, especially when you played a little bit longer, you start to realize how hard it is to get there. All you can really do is just give it everything you have.\u201d\n\nThe first pitch for Wednesday\u2019s Game 5 at Dodger Stadium is set for 8:37 p.m.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
