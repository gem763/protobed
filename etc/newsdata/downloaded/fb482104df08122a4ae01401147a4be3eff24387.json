We are preparing for this.\u201d\n\nBefore the tournament started, Leitch said Japan wanted to win the World Cup, which raised eyebrows at the time. Now the Brave Blossoms have reached the quarter-finals for the first time, the team are not lowering their expectations.\n\n\u201cThis team is not satisfied with what we have today. This is not the end,\u201d said Leitch.\n\n\u201cWe are in the last eight... but we want to play more to have a chance to show what we can do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSouth Africa looks scary, but if we look at our game plan and how to destroy (theirs), we get excited and we gain more confidence to win.\u201d\n\nTeam: 15-Ryohei Yamanaka, 14-Kotaro Matsushima, 13-Timothy Lafaele, 12-Ryoto Nakamura, 11-Kenki Fukuoka, 10-Yu Tamura, 9-Yutaka Nagare, 8-Kazuki Himeno, 7-Pieter Labuschagne, 6-Michael Leitch (captain), 5-James Moore, 4-Luke Thompson, 3-Jiwon Koo, 2-Shota Horie, 1-Keita Inagaki\n\nReplacements: 16-Atsushi Sakate, 17-Isileli Nakajima, 18-Asaeli Ai Valu, 19-Wimpie van der Walt, 20-Amanaki Lelei Mafi, 21-Fumiaki Tanaka 22-Rikiya Matsuda, 23-Lomano Lava Lemeki", "description": "Japan have made one injury-enforced change to the starting line-up for Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against South Africa, bringing Ryohei Yamanaka in at fullback in place of William Tupou.", "authors": ["Yoko Kono", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442155803&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0A3", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
