It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic,\u201d said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group, after flying over the Abaco Islands. \u201cIt\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian: 'historic tragedy' prompts worldwide call for aid for Bahamas Read more\n\nShe said her representative on Abaco told her there were \u201ca lot more dead\u201d, though she could not provide numbers as bodies were still being gathered. Images on local media showed bodies being put on a truck, and there were fears others may have been washed out to sea during the storm surges that inundated the islands.\n\nAccording to reports early on Wednesday, some people remained stuck on rooftops waiting to be rescued. The death toll is expected rise in the coming days.\n\nAs the storm diminished from a powerful category 5 and moved on towards the US coast, the full scale of the damage started to be revealed, with airports underwater and whole residential neighbourhoods smashed by winds that reached 185mph and pounding waves.\n\nInitial assessments suggested that thousands of buildings had been damaged, some beyond repair, while people took shelter in cramped attic spaces to escape the rising flood waters.\n\nAerial and satellite images showed flood waters covering much of the northern islands.\n\nThe health minister, Duane Sands, said Dorian left the main hospital on Grand Bahama unusable, while the hospital at Marsh Harbour on Abaco was in need of food, water, medicine and surgical supplies. He said crews were trying to evacuate up to seven kidney failure patients from Abaco who had not received dialysis since Friday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Volunteers rescue people from rising flood waters in Freeport, Grand Bahama, on Tuesday.

UN officials said more than 60,000 people on the islands would need food, and the Red Cross said about 62,000 would need clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cWhat we are hearing lends credence to the fact that this has been a catastrophic storm and a catastrophic impact,\u201d Cochrane said.\n\nThe Bahamas deputy prime minister, Peter Turnquest, said it would require \u201chundreds of millions, if not billions\u201d to rebuild Abaco and Grand Bahama, adding that the government would be making an international appeal for financial help.\n\n\u201cWe have had catastrophic damage to both the public and private infrastructure that will take hundreds of millions, if not billions, to fund recovery and reconstruction,\u201d Turnquest said.\n\n\u201cWith approximately 70% of the homes underwater, we anticipate tremendous social and economic dislocation and disruption in the short term. The mental health of those who have endured this monster storm is a priority concern of the government.\u201d\n\nThe Bahamas\u2019 prime minister, Hubert Minnis, told a press conference he anticipated more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require \u201ca massive, coordinated effort\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history,\u201d said Minnis. \u201cNo effort or resources will be held back.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarsh Habour has suffered, I would estimate, in excess of 60% damage to their homes,\u201d said Minnis. \u201cThe Mud, as we know, has been completely destroyed or decimated,\u201d he added, referring to a shantytown known as the Mud and the Peas.\n\nFive US Coast Guard helicopters were running shuttles to Abaco, and British naval personnel from RFA Mounts Bay also joined the rescue effort. Elsewhere Bahamians used jetskis and boats to get to safety, and even a huge bulldozer, which cradled children and adults in its digger as it churned its way through deep waters.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want people thinking we\u2019ve forgotten them ... We know what your conditions are,\u201d Tammy Mitchell of the Bahamas\u2019 National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station.", "description": "Deputy PM sets out scale of damage as death toll rises and images show whole areas razed", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont", "Michael Mann", "Andrew E Dessler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720052920a0e30b9cbcedc3063cdc776d4f9b341/115_0_2600_1560/master/2600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ec5fa005b6ea68c8dcdd0e198cea3e72"}
