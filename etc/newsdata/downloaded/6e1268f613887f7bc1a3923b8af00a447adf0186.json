Spaceport is no different.\n\nA social hub includes an interactive digital walkway and a coffee bar made of Italian marble. On the upper deck, shades of white and gray speak to Virgin Galactic\u2019s more lofty mission.\n\nOur Design Director, Jeremy Brown, showcases our Mission Control at Spaceport America and explains what\u2019s coming next as we continue to make the Gateway to Space ready for commercial operations. https://t.co/YZeU5ys2To pic.twitter.com/t5GhbpQQpX \u2014 Virgin Galactic (@virgingalactic) August 15, 2019\n\nCompany officials say the space is meant to create \u201can unparalleled experience\u201d as customers prepare for what Virgin Galactic describes as the journey of a lifetime.\n\nJust how soon customers will file into Virgin Galactic\u2019s newly outfitted digs for the first commercial flights to space has yet to be determined. A small number of test flights are still needed.\n\n\u201cWe were the first company to fly a commercial space ship to space with somebody in the back who was not a pilot \u2014 first time that somebody like that has been able to get out of their seats and float around the cabin,\u201d Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides said. \u201cSo it\u2019s happening. We have a bit more work to do before we get to commercial service.\u201d\n\nBillionaire Richard Branson, who is behind Virgin Galactic, and former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a Democrat, first pitched the plan for the spaceport nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThere were construction delays and cost overruns. Virgin Galactic\u2019s spaceship development took far longer than expected and had a major setback when its first experimental craft broke apart during a 2014 test flight, killing the co-pilot.\n\nCritics suggested the project was a boondoggle, but supporters argued that there were bound to be hard and sometimes costly lessons.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. George Munoz has enduring concerns about the business model for commercial, low-orbit travel for passengers.\n\n\u201cYou can have all the money in the world and come back and say, \u2018Was my 30 seconds of fame worth that risk?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMunoz says New Mexico\u2019s anticipated return on investment in terms of jobs and visitors is still overdue, with more than $200 million in public funds spent on Spaceport America in cooperation with Virgin Galactic as the anchor tenant.\n\nAt the facility Thursday, the carrier plane for Virgin\u2019s rocket-powered passenger ship made a few passes and touch-and-goes over a runway.\n\nBehind the spaceport\u2019s signature wall of curved glass, mission control sits on the second floor with an unobstructed view of the runway and beyond.\n\nThere\u2019s also space behind two massive sliding doors to accommodate two of Virgin Galactic\u2019s carrier planes and a fleet of six-passenger rocket ships.\n\nVirgin Galactic posted on social media earlier this week that its main operating base was now at the spaceport. And Branson said the wing of Virgin\u2019s next rocket ship has been completed.\n\nChief Pilot Dave Mackay said the crew in the coming days will fly simulated launch missions to ensure in-flight communications and airspace coordination work as planned. The pilots also will be familiarizing themselves with New Mexico\u2019s airspace and landmarks.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico is on track to become one of the very few places on this beautiful planet which regularly launches humans to space,\u201d Mackay said.\n\nWhitesides said that once the test flights are complete, commercial operations can begin. He envisions a fundamental shift in humanity\u2019s relationship with space, noting that fewer than 600 people ever have ventured beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to send way more than that to space from this facility here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn another 15 years, I really hope that we\u2019ve had thousands of people go.\u201d\n\nAbout 600 people have reserved a seat, according to the company, at a cost of $250,000 a ticket.\n\nThat buys them a ride on the winged rocket ship, which is dropped in flight from the carrier airplane. Once free, it fires its rocket motor to hurtle toward the boundary of space before gliding back down.\n\nThe latest test flight reached an altitude of 56 miles while traveling at three times the speed of sound.", "description": "Spaceport America is no longer just a shiny shell of hope that space tourism would one day launch from this remote spot in the New Mexico desert.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP583_virgin_ZG_20190815194708.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
