His save against Reus - diving to his left, then calmly snapping up the rebound on the line before any of the onrushing Dortmund players could reach the ball - was his fourth from six penalties he has faced in the Champions League.\n\n\u201cPeople know what I\u2019m capable of. I just want to concentrate on my work and show my capabilities to 100%. I think I managed that today,\u201d Ter Stegen said.\n\nTer Stegen, undisputed No. 1 at Barcelona, is finding it much harder to break through for Germany. The 27-year-old goalkeeper expressed disappointment with his reserve role after last week\u2019s European qualifiers against the Netherlands and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe 33-year-old Neuer, who is also Germany\u2019s captain, kept his place between the posts to leave Ter Stegen on the bench, as he has been for every competitive international game since October 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to find an explanation for it. I give my best in every game to make the decision more difficult,\u201d Ter Stegen said. \u201cThese international games were a tough blow for me.\u201d\n\nBayern Munich goalkeeper Neuer showed little sympathy after his team\u2019s 1-1 draw at Leipzig in the German league on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe never said anything about it when we were on international duty. Basically I think that we should always appear as a team, and I don\u2019t know if this helps,\u201d Neuer said. \u201cI\u2019m a team player and always think of what\u2019s best for the team.\u201d\n\nNeuer referred to the duel between Germany goalkeepers Jens Lehmann and long-time No. 1 Oliver Kahn before the 2006 World Cup, and the praise Kahn paid his rival for a brilliant performance in the quarterfinal win over Argentina.\n\nTer Stegen hit back at the notion he wasn\u2019t a team player.\n\n\u201cIf you think of the past years, you can see how I\u2019ve carried myself. So these comments are not appropriate,\u201d the German said.\n\nBarcelona coach Ernesto Valverde thanked the goalkeeper for \u201chis outstanding saves\u201d against Dortmund, while former Spain and Real Madrid No. 1 Iker Casillas tweeted \u201cTer Stegen\u2019s level today was sensational.\u201d\n\nTer Stegen\u2019s next chance to impress L\u00f6w will be Germany\u2019s friendly against Argentina on Oct. 9 in Dortmund.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Whether Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w was watching or not, Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen delivered his message.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/germany_soccer_champions_league_33018_c272-0-3113-1657_s1770x1032.jpg?22beb37d8cec9096f6cc9f506d0078e753afc1f8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
