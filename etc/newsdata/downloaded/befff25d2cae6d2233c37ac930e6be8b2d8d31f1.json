He's so well known on the block, residents have dubbed him the honorary mayor.\n\nBut while Johnson lives in the Chelsea neighborhood, he doesn't have a home. He has slept on the same stoop on the street for over a year.\n\nLocal residents have not only gotten used to Johnson being there. Many of them have also formed friendships with him, and they've stepped in to help.\n\nJohnson found himself on the streets after a 20-year relationship ended in a bad breakup. \"I took a fall\u2026 it really killed me,\" he told CBS New York. On the streets, he greets families, businessmen and even well-known defense attorney Ron Kuby, who gives him hugs.\n\nJennifer Mallicote and Julie Benlevi spearheaded the effort to find Johnell Johnson a job. WCBS\n\nNeighbor Jennifer Mallicote is glad she took time to stop and chat with him. \"It was that one time I sat down and had a conversation \u2013 quite honestly, it's changed my whole outlook,\" she said.\n\nMallicote and other neighbors have rallied behind him in an effort to help him get a job. Mallicote got him an old cellphone, since employers had no way of contacting him.\n\n\"It could be any of us at any time,\" Mallicote said. \"He doesn't ask for anything. He just gives you a greeting and there's no way you can't greet him back and be grateful.\"\n\nAnother neighbor, Julie Benlevi, put up more than 100 flyers, marketing Johnson for jobs. Benlevi has also gone to interviews with Johnson, who has decades of experience in the food industry.\n\n\"We want to get him off the streets before winter time,\" Benlevi said.\n\nResidents also got Johnson a membership at a local recreation center where he can shower and shave.\n\nRecently, Johnson shared an update. On an Instagram page his neighbors set up to help him gain opportunities, he said he got a job at Gran Tivoli restaurant in the Soho neighborhood of New York City.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to sleeping in a bed as soon as I am able,\" he posted.", "description": "\"He doesn't ask for anything.
