They left the show in 2018, despite the naysayers, and have continued to maintain their brand ever since. They\u2019re also preparing to launch their own network next year, so this is Oprah-level stuff.\n\nThe takeaway from the situation was clear for Gaines.\n\n\u201cFor that, ironic and complete opposite reality to have occurred is a pretty powerful testimony to just be yourself, man,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing yourself is more powerful than whatever it is that everybody\u2019s telling you you have to do or you\u2019re supposed to do, ya know?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGaines has said before that the final years of the couple\u2019s show were tough.\n\n\u201cTV was a funny thing for me,\u201d he told Cowboys and Indians magazine in December. \u201cI\u2019m an authentic, sincere person. So, as long as things are natural and organic, I\u2019m in my element. But the more staged something becomes, or the more required something becomes, it boxes me up, and I felt like toward the end of the Fixer Upper journey, I felt caged, trapped.\u201d\n\nThe couples\u2019 interview on Sunday Today With Willie Geist airs at 8 a.m. ET/PT Sunday.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nWant daily pop culture news delivered to your inbox?
