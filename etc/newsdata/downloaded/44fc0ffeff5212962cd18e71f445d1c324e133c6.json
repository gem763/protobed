It would culminate with England having 19 runs to defend from the final over, entrusted to regular death bowler Ben Stokes.\n\nStokes would be bowling to Carlos Brathwaite. The West Indies side was brimming with established T20 superstars, but Brathwaite was not among them. He was only in the West Indies\u2019s World Cup squad as a replacement player. When he arrived at the crease in Kolkata, he did so with the sum total of 25 international T20 runs in his entire career, and many guffawing at his new \u00a3420,000 IPL contract.\n\nBrathwaite had reached 10 by the time of the final over, when England captain Eoin Morgan helped Stokes plan his approach. \"We are standing at the end of Stokes\u2019s mark talking about the three balls that he can bowl,\" Morgan recalled. \"So with the field that was set he could bowl a straight yorker, wide slower ball or a bouncer. And he bowled really well at the death throughout the whole tournament and he went to start with a yorker.\"\n\nAs he prepared to face the final over, Brathwaite \"was numb. It was a state that I\u2019ve only reached a couple times since... I had a clear mindset, I just watched the ball and allowed my instincts to react.\"\n\nStokes missed his first yorker by a fair way, and Brathwaite swatted it over the fine leg boundary for six.", "description": "In the second extract from their new book 'Cricket 2.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Freddie Wilde", "Michael Vaughan", "Simon Heffer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000094521972-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNPUhnktKekiIw5QCPcpjGwHeCl6qgNgc6ZJ3RLtalbY.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
