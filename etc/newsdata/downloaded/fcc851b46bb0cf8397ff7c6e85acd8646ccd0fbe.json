Countries in the third world, especially those in Africa, but also Asia and Latin America, may be seriously affected.\n\nAt the same time, the plan envisions an end to aid programs targeting the underlying reasons, such as poverty and racism, that people join terrorist groups, arguing that they don\u2019t work. It deemphasizes multilateral organizations as a channel for U.S. aid and stresses the value of the private sector. And it says the aid strategy should allow the U.S. to expand its leadership \u201c in the global energy system.\u201d Ultimately, the plan\u2019s goal is to wean countries off of U.S. assistance.\n\nIt\u2019s an approach that Trump backers have argued would save money and encourage other countries to align with the U.S., but one that has already unsettled humanitarian aid workers and Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to bring countries over to our side by saying, \u2018If you want anything from us you gotta take nothing from them,\u2019 because China\u2019s not forcing that choice,\u201d added Jeremy Konyndyk, a former top official with the U.S. Agency for International Development during the Obama administration.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But the draft is the product of many months of review. Releasing the final version would fulfill a public pledge Trump has made to rethink U.S. aid.\n\n\u201cWe will examine what is working, what is not working, and whether the countries who receive our dollars and our protection also have our interests at heart,\u201d Trump told world leaders during last year\u2019s U.N. General Assembly. \u201cMoving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends.\u201d\n\nThe White House on Friday did not comment.\n\nAlready, humanitarian leaders are warning against such a change in paradigm. Even if America has long disbursed aid based in part on political allegiance \u2014 notably, Israel has long been a top recipient of U.S. funds \u2014 aid experts made aware of the draft said the Trump plan emphasizes short-term thinking instead of long-term progress.\n\n\u201cThis feels a lot more transactional than the way we\u2019ve approached foreign aid in modern times,\u201d said one aid expert who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Trump approach appears to be: \u201cWe are providing assistance to our friends, we\u2019re getting something out of it, and we\u2019d better get something out of it soon.\u201d\n\nTrump has asked Congress to pass a law that effectively reorients U.S. aid to prioritize friendly countries, though there\u2019s no sign lawmakers plan to do that. But the executive branch still has a fair amount of flexibility on the subject even though Congress is in charge of the U.S. budget.\n\nThe draft document stresses that the U.S. faces a renewal of \u201cgreat power competition\u201d \u2014 a term now taken to mean the growing rivalry for geopolitical influence among the U.S., Russia and China.\n\nSuch rivalry is much more complex today than during the Cold War, and U.S. foreign aid has not kept up in a way that benefits America, the document says. To boost its influence, the U.S. must be more strategic in how it disburses aid, the document argues.\n\nTo that end, the U.S. should \u201credirect, reconfigure, reduce or eliminate foreign assistance that is supporting governments and non-state actors under the strong influence of United States competitors and adversaries,\u201d the draft says.\n\nIt goes on to say the U.S. should \u201creduce or eliminate foreign assistance to countries and international organizations that are working against or do not support United States interests and focus it on allies and partners that are cooperating with the United States.\u201d\n\nThe document does not spell out exactly what other countries must do to display their loyalty to the U.S. However, Trump and his aides have in the past said that not voting with the U.S. in forums such as the United Nations could be a factor.\n\nNikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, has loudly promoted the idea that the U.S. should stop sending funds to countries that don\u2019t support it at the world body. That includes countries that vote against the priorities of Israel, a key U.S. ally.\n\nIn an op-ed , Haley listed South Africa as an example of a country that frequently sides against the U.S. at the United Nations, and hinted that the U.S. should rethink the aid it gives to the country, much of which is for HIV/AIDS programs.\n\n\u201cWhen foreign aid goes to countries that take our generosity and bite our hand, rather than link up arms with us, it\u2019s time to stop it,\u201d Haley wrote.\n\nIn broad terms, U.S. foreign aid has always been considered a tool to promote U.S. national security, experts said. Modern presidents have taken a holistic view of what that means.\n\nFor instance, former President Barack Obama\u2019s presidential policy directive that laid out his vision of aid was premised on the idea that the U.S. would itself benefit if it helped grow \u201cthe ranks of prosperous, capable, and democratic states.\u201d It did not explicitly categorize countries into worthy or unworthy.\n\nUnder President George W. Bush, the U.S. began spending huge amounts on aid for Afghanistan and Iraq following the U.S. invasion of those countries. But Bush also saw opportunities in using aid to curry favor elsewhere: He lifted restrictions on aid groups and directed millions of dollars in assistance to Iran, a longtime U.S. nemesis, after a devastating 2003 earthquake there.\n\nTrump has a complicated view of foreign aid. He has spoken positively about it as a tool for advancing U.S. interests, and yet he\u2019s repeatedly proposed cutting billions of dollars in foreign aid from the U.S. budget. He\u2019s also faced criticism that he is politicizing aid in places like Venezuela, where the U.S. has tried to use the lure of aid to convince Venezuelans to overthrow dictator Nicolas Maduro.\n\nPresident George W.

It states, for example, that the friends-only approach can be overridden if there are \u201coverriding strategic, national security, or humanitarian concerns that require its continuation.\u201d\n\nThat means a country such as Egypt, which activists regularly slam for its poor human rights record, is likely to keep receiving large amounts of U.S. aid because it helps the U.S. counter terrorist groups and foreign adversaries in the Middle East.\n\nThe draft document emphasizes the importance of countries eventually \u201cgraduating\u201d off of U.S. foreign assistance completely. It argues for the need to leverage the private sector to help struggling states and the importance of evaluating aid programs to make sure they are achieving their goals.\n\nIt is in many ways dismissive of multilateral institutions involved in aid.\n\nThe document says the U.S. should move toward voluntary payments instead of required \u2014 or \u201cassessed\u201d \u2014 payments for certain U.N. bodies that \u201cdo not serve the interests of the United States,\u201d though it does not say which. It also suggests shifting foreign aid to \u201cbilateral channels as much as possible.\u201d\n\nOne directive in the draft could prove especially controversial. It states the U.S. should \u201cend foreign assistance programs designed to address the supposed socioeconomic causes of terrorism.\u201d\n\nAid experts say they can see some value in rethinking the approach to such programs as researchers regularly reassess what factors lead people to join terrorist groups. Still, it could come down to how this directive is defined and whether it\u2019s possible to accurately gauge a program\u2019s success.\n\nThe document also says U.S. aid should support America\u2019s \u201ceconomic interests.\u201d Under that rubric, it includes supporting programs that empower women worldwide, a favorite issue of Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser.\n\nAlso under that concept, the draft recommends the U.S. help other nations \"increase access to affordable and reliable energy, and expand United States leadership in the global energy system.\u201d\n\nThe document does not delve into detail on that issue, but many Trump administration officials view future access to energy sources as critical in staying a step ahead of rivals such as China and Russia.", "description": "Foreign aid policy has long operated under the principle \u2014 at least in theory if not always in practice \u2014 that financial assistance should prioritize humanitarian need.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/76/d4/fa7bbfd14981bbf1b35362db9808/190906-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
