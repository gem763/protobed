The No. 11 Longhorns (4-1, 2-0) face No. 6 Oklahoma (5-0, 2-0) on Saturday in Dallas in the Big 12\u2019s biggest border rivalry.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m playing running back right now, I\u2019m a running back,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\nNothing was simple about his position change. It happened because Texas became desperate as preseason injuries piled up so fast coach that Tom Herman had nowhere else to turn. Texas had only two healthy scholarship running backs by the end of training camp.\n\nSitting in the quarterbacks meeting room was Johnson, who signed with Texas as one of the top dual-threat quarterbacks in the country, and who rushed for 4,900 yards in high school.\n\nJohnson could clearly make people miss. But could he handle the position change against college defenses and would he want to?\n\nHe\u2019s the one made the first move, sending a text to Herman before the season-opener against Louisiana Tech.\n\n\u201cIf you need me,\u201d Johnson told Herman, \u201cPlay me.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s coaches and teammates had already seen his passion to play. Texas freshmen wear a red stripe on their helmet in training camp until they earn the right to take if off. The day Johnson was allowed to take off his stripe, he delivered a fiery speech to his teammates that he\u2019d do anything for them.\n\n\u201cHe pretty much poured his heart out,\u201d said Texas senior center and team captain Zack Shackelford.\n\nHis drive matched the team\u2019s needs at running back. Herman first planned to play Johnson on special teams, knowing he could still redshirt if he didn\u2019t play more than four games. But when the tailback injuries list grew too long, Johnson was in the backfield in the season opener, even though Herman had called him a \u201cbreak glass in case of emergency\u201d option.\n\nSmash.\n\nBy the end of the first game, an injury to No. 2 tailback Jordan Whittington had moved Johnson up the depth chart again.\n\nEven Ehlinger didn\u2019t always know who he\u2019d be handing the ball on any given play.\n\n\u201cI looked over and it was Roschon,\u201d Ehlinger said. \u201cI was like \u2018What\u2019s up, bro?\u2019 \u2026 We were sitting in the same (quarterback) room a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\nJohnson had to carry the running game himself at West Virginia when starter Keaontay Ingram got roughed up early (Ingram would return late in the game), and Johnson tore through the Mountaineers at an average of 5.8 yards per carry. The effort earned him honors as Big 12 newcomer of the week.\n\nProduction like that is simply too good to take off the field. Daniel Young and Kirk Johnson, two of the tailbacks who were injured early, have both returned, but neither has more than four carries while Johnson keeps pounding out yards.\n\nJohnson has made the switch look natural. He\u2019s patient behind his blockers and looks comfortable running in the middle of the line.\n\nBut he wants to eventually throw passes again. Herman and Johnson eventually will have to talk about his future as a quarterback, where he was No. 3 on the depth chart when the season began. And with Ehlinger just a junior, it could be a while.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ll do anything for this team,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m just rolling with the flow right now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Roschon Johnson arrived at Texas expecting a season of learning how to be a college quarterback, not being the Longhorns' emergency fix at running back.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jim Vertuno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/texas_west_virginia_football_69703_c0-123-3000-1872_s1770x1032.jpg?638d87d471198716a92bdd753afc4a2ee0294bf9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
