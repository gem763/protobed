(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA new report from the UK seems to confirm vets\u2019 worst fears, suggesting that pet vaccination rates in the country have dropped off substantially in recent years.\n\nVeterinarians have been desperately reminding everyone that vaccines are safe and won\u2019t give pets autism (seriously).\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t entirely clear if pet owners really were shying away from vaccines. The new report comes courtesy of the People\u2019s Dispensary for Sick Animals, which claims to be the UK\u2019s leading veterinary charity.\n\nSince 2011, the PDSA has carried out an annual survey of pet owners in the country, dubbed the PDSA Animal Wellbeing, or PAW, report. This year\u2019s report involved just over 5,000 pet owners. Most of these were cat and/or dog owners, but few owned rabbits as well.\n\nIn addition to questions about their pet\u2019s overall health, like how often they walked their dog, the owners are asked about their pet\u2019s vaccination history. In 2016, 84 per cent said their pets had gotten their needed shots when they were young. But by 2018, that percentage had dropped down to 66 per cent, continuing a trend seen the year previously.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct evidence in the survey that pet owners are buying into the propaganda spouted by the anti-vaccination movement \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to have asked people whether they think pet vaccines can cause autism, for instance. The most commonly stated reasons for not vaccinating were that it was too expensive or that their pets never interacted with other animals (both 17 per cent); 10 per cent said they had simply never gotten around to it.\n\nBut there\u2019s definitely some reason to think vaccine hysteria might be playing a role. For one, people didn\u2019t report going to the vet or using other pet health services any less often in 2018 than they did in previous years \u2014 it was just vaccines they were avoiding more. And some owners said they didn\u2019t think the vaccines were necessary (16 per cent).\n\nThe authors of the PDSA report explicitly say that myths and misinformation about human vaccines spread through social media could be affecting pet owners, too.\n\n\u201cThese negative messages about vaccines can be projected onto pets in surprising ways \u2014 for example, the false link between the [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccines and autism has also been applied to pet vaccines by sceptics, despite any link being thoroughly debunked in people and autism not being documented in pets,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIn the UK at least, lower levels of pet vaccination seem to track with reported decreases in rates of childhood vaccination in people. And this decline in vaccination is at least partly to blame for the country losing its measles-free status just last month.\n\nThe U.S. doesn\u2019t seem to have any concrete data on how often owners are vaccinating their pets. But the country as a whole is teetering on the brink of losing its measles-free status as well, as outbreaks since last September have led to the highest toll in over 25 years.\n\nOf course, pets need vaccines every bit as much as we do. A dog isn\u2019t smart enough to understand the value of preventative healthcare \u2014 but its owner really should be.", "description": "A new report from the UK seems to confirm vets\u2019 worst fears, suggesting that pet vaccination rates in the country have dropped off substantially in recent years....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Adam Clark Estes"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/btffhnr5sayvfkdl8ryw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
