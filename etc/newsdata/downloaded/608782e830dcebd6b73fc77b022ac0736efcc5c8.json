The problem continues to be that Beckham, like so many other great receivers past, present, and future, believes he\u2019s open even when he isn\u2019t.\n\nAnd so, with the Browns losing five of seven games, Beckham has no qualms about voicing complaints about five catches on seven targets because he genuinely believes that, if the team would get him the ball more often, the Browns would win more games. In Beckham\u2019s brain, there\u2019s a correlation between him not getting the ball as much as he\u2019d like and Kitchens not winning as much as he\u2019d like.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s fair to wonder whether Beckham would like to turn the clock back to March and get traded to team other than the Browns, because the relationship definitely hasn\u2019t unfolded the way that he and many others thought it would. It\u2019s also fair to wonder whether Kitchens or anyone else with the Browns is privately wishing that the deal had never happened.", "description": "After the Browns lost to the Patriots on Sunday, Cleveland receiver Odell Beckham Jr. expressed regret that the offense \"shied away\" from \"challenging\" New England cornerback Stephon Gilmore.
