The card streamed on ESPN+.\n\nWaterson (17-6 MMA, 5-2 UFC) endured five rounds with former champion Joanna Jedrzejczyk (16-3 MMA, 10-3 UFC) and didn\u2019t fold when adversity struck. As she battled through a busted nose, Waterson seemingly gave the performance the fullest of efforts.\n\nStill taking time to speak with reporters gathered backstage Saturday night, an emotional Waterson gave her thoughts on the performance and where she goes from there.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Waterson didn\u2019t enter Saturday\u2019s fight with the intention of walking away without her win bonus. Having so many fans cheer her on in a losing effort, Waterson is motivated to keep pushing towards to belt. Conversely, she feels bad \u201cletting down\u201d her supporters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody steps into the octagon with the idea of losing. Just the fact that the crowd was still cheering and behind me, it fills my heart. It lets me know that I\u2019m on the right track. That\u2019s the fight game and that\u2019s life. You can\u2019t win them all.\n\n\u201c.. The feeling of victory is addicting. The highs are super high and I always say the lows are really low. I think the hardest part is letting down all my coaches and fans because of all the time they put into me.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, Waterson wishes she had attacked with her takedowns differently. She said her inability to get the fight to the canvas played a major factor in her lack of success.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing was I was impatient,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cWe had 25 minutes to get it done. I was comfortable on the outside and I should have stayed there a little bit longer for her to give me the takedown.\n\n\u201cInstead, I reached for it and we ended up in the clinch up against the cage more often than I would have liked. That was the determining factor in the fight.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Waterson has experienced a loss. She knows the feeling and has been there twice before in the UFC. \u201cThe Karate Hottie\u201d indicated the loss may be necessary for long term results.\n\n\u201cThis was what I was focused on and this was what I needed,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cI feel like everything happens for a reason and I needed this to understand how to move forward.\u201d\n\nIn case she needed reassurance, former UFC champion and Waterson\u2019s close friend Holly Holm greeted her outside of the cage post-fight. The two embraced, sharing an emotional moment as the fans in attendance straggled out.\n\nFighting back tears, Waterson shared what the two fighters discussed.\n\n\u201cShe just said she knew it wasn\u2019t outcome that I wanted,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cBut she just said it was a lot closer than what I probably feel like it is in my heart and that I\u2019m still improving and it\u2019s still a step forward.\u201d\n\nCheck out the emotional moment shared between the two JacksonWink fighters in the clip below:\n\nGallery Joanna Jedrzejczyk def.
