The platform allows users to send a maximum of around USD 4,700 per day.\n\nThe same media outlet quotes Pavel Vrublevsky, the founder of Russian payments firm ChronoPay, as stating that Sberbank\u2019s solution is a \u201creal breakthrough.\u201d\n\nThe ChronoPay chief said,\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if this move somewhat reduces the demand for cryptocurrencies in Russia. It\u2019s no secret that cryptocurrencies are often used to withdraw funds. In many cases, there is no issue about the legality or otherwise of [cryptocurrency] transactions. Instead, it\u2019s often the bureaucratic complexity of the overseas transactions procedure [that forces people to choose cryptocurrency for international transactions].\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Sberbank sent a Russia-based customer a notice, asking them to declare their cryptocurrency earnings to the country\u2019s tax authorities.\n\nAs previously reported, financial companies are currently stepping up their act in a bid to cut fees and speed up transaction times \u2013 as individuals and companies increasingly turn to Bitcoin and altcoins as cross-border transaction solutions.\n\nEarlier this month, Ripple released an advertisement that highlights the alacrity and efficacy of crypto transactions \u2013 and appears to showcase a platform not unlike what Sberbank looks to be proposing.\n\nA 2018 Ripple brand awareness advertisement seemingly derided the slow, costly and ineffective nature of the banking sector\u2019s cross-border conventional transaction solutions.\n\nRegardless, many crypto advocates will argue that crypto, which runs 24/7, still has the edge over any conventional banking platform, Sberbank\u2019s solution included \u2013 with higher transaction speeds, fees that still might be lower and no limits on transaction size.\n\nLearn more:\n\nInternational Money Transfer: Western Union vs World Remit vs Bitcoin\n\nG7 Going to War Over Control of Money, Says 'Bitcoin Failed'", "description": "Russian bank Sberbank has introduced a new low-cost, cross-border remittance solution that it believes will be able to compete with cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions.
