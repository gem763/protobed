Business Insider Intelligence\n\nClegg noted that the social network would stick to its preexisting guidelines, which have for a year dictated that politician posts are exempt from its third-party fact-checking program and left up because they are vital to the public interest. The announcement calls to mind Twitter's decision to censor \u2014 but not remove \u2014 harmful posts from verified public figures, like politicians, that are deemed important information.\n\nThe announcement is likely meant to clarify Facebook's role in political discourse ahead of high-stakes events, like the just-announced impeachment inquiry and the 2020 presidential elections. Facebook's policy on Elections and Political Speech isn't new \u2014 it's been around in this form for over a year.\n\nGiven its timing, Facebook's decision to remind the public of its policy can be read as a preemptive move against criticism about its over- or under-involvement in moderating political discourse: The announcement was made just hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into the president of the United States.\n\nFacebook likely expects that the impeachment inquiry will play out on its platform to some degree, and wishes to minimize the odds it is accused of favoring one outcome or another. Facebook was likely planning to make a similar announcement ahead of the 2020 election anyway given the backlash it received for its role in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn distancing itself from decisions about political discourse, Facebook could disappoint critics expecting the company to take on a more active role in the wake of the 2016 election. In allowing content from politicians \u2014 no matter if it is harmful or false \u2014 to remain on its platform, Facebook might avoid further claims of political bias or censorship. But its recusal might also inspire criticism that the company is taking the easy way out and further fueling the spread of misinformation and hate speech as a result, something Clegg noted as a risk in his speech.\n\nTo its credit, Facebook will \"draw the line at any speech that can lead to real-world violence and harm,\" but still, it's unclear how exactly those terms will be defined. In that way, the company's attempt to clarify its role simply creates a new set of questions and blurry lines. It's possible that questions of this nature are exactly the sort of decisions Facebook's exec team intends expects its content moderation Oversight Board to handle. Punting such decisions to the independent body could allow Facebook's management to ensure both a healthy distance and a more appropriately democratic process for issues with high societal stakes.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
