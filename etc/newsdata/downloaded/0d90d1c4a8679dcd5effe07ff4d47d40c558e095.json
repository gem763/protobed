The reason for that not taking place is because the information being asked for by the spokesman \u2013 who is not their lawyer, by the way \u2013 I legally cannot provide.\u201d\n\nAdderley had been scheduled to meet Dunn\u2019s parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, on Wednesday afternoon but the family cancelled the meeting after it became clear he would not answer a series of key questions, according to Radd Seiger, spokesman for Dunn\u2019s family. Adderley insisted this information was classified.\n\nAlthough the police chief recognised the desire for answers, he called on Seiger to \u201cexercise constraint\u201d since his commentary was \u201cunhelpful\u201d.\n\nHowever, Adderley said that the Dunn family discovered Sacoolas had returned to the UK before they were informed by police. He confirmed Northamptonshire police were asked by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office not to inform the family for several days, so they could work out the next legal steps.\n\nThe suspect, whose husband was reportedly stationed at the airbase as an intelligence officer, has remained in contact with officers despite her return to the US.\n\n\u201cThe suspect has cooperated fully with the police and with the authorities,\u201d Adderley said. \u201cShe has also requested to be interviewed by British police officers under caution in the United States.\u201d\n\nIn an \u201cunprecedented\u201d press conference, Adderley debunked reports that Sacoolas had left the UK without giving an account to police. He said she cooperated with police at the scene on 27 August and was breathalysed.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe very next day, police officers attended the home address of the suspect, where once again she cooperated with the police and gave an account regarding the circumstances of that collision.\n\n\u201cIt was at that point diplomatic immunity was mentioned and on that very day, Northamptonshire applied for the waiver against that.\u201d\n\nShe returned to the US on an air force plane shortly afterwards, and Adderley said there was nothing more police could do after diplomatic immunity had been flagged.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn Monday 16 September, Northamptonshire police are informed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that the waiver had been declined and the suspect had left the UK.\u201d\n\nIt came after further criticism from Seiger on Tuesday. He said the family appeared to be receiving \u201ccontradictory\u201d statements from the authorities which was compounding their misery.\n\nAfter the press conference, he said: \u201cThe family have lost all faith and confidence in both the police and the Foreign Office. There is a clear breach of the victim code here \u2013 first and foremost they did not tell the family for a number of weeks that she had gone.\u201d\n\nDunn\u2019s parents will meet the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, on Tuesday and she is expected to call for a parliamentary inquiry into the teenager\u2019s death.\n\nOn Monday, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, told the Commons he had commissioned a review into immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at RAF Croughton in light of the case.\n\nRaab said there were \u201cno barriers to justice being done\u201d for Dunn.\n\nHe also said the UK government believed diplomatic immunity \u201cclearly ended\u201d for Sacoolas, 42, when she left the country for the US.", "description": "Northamptonshire police chief says he wants to \u2018provide clarity and put rumours to bed\u2019", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5de3df4ff5bb55e86d5ad9292e4155fe4d224ff/0_171_4440_2664/master/4440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd1d1da70a323d20bd05e702cb2c49c9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
