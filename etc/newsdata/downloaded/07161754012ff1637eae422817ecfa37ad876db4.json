The commissioner also found Ms Odgers had \u201cmisappropriated\u201d the butter knives from BHP.\n\nOn the selfie, taking while Ms Odgers was wearing a shirt with a BHP logo, the commissioner questioned \u201chow any of the women in the photo thought it would be a good idea to pose for such a selfie in the workplace defies belief\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is true that the photo depicts less skin than one would typically see at the beach or at a public swimming pool,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is the provocative pose of each of the women, and act of each of them having unbuttoned their shirts down to below the bottom of their bra, each leaning forward that causes discomfort that employees have elected to behave this way in the workplace.\u201d\n\nBut given the women kept their bras on, she said an appropriate disciplinary action would have been to give them a first and final warning.\n\nAs to BHP's lack of action over an employee telling the media the mine was a \u201csausage fest\u201d, the commissioner said Ms Odgers' interpretation was \u201coff track\u201d.\n\n\u201cA \u2018sausage fest\u2019 means that there is a preponderance of men compared to women. The reference to \u2018sausage\u2019 is a colloquialism because men have a penis and hence the correlation to a sausage.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by BHP\u2019s haphazard approach to its \u201cfair play\u201d policy, which said warnings must be given in disciplinary procedures and was an obligation in the company's enterprise agreement.\n\nAs a result, she found the dismissal was unjust and unreasonable and ordered BHP pay compensation.", "description": "The Fair Work Commission has awarded compensation to the female mine worker despite finding her behaviour \"defies belief\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4537%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c6792ac1df0dc8d924cf613cd0875de624bddac6", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
