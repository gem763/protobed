Arcadia is trying to make simple a more complicated dynamic that's at play due to how our electricity systems work.\n\nThe big picture: Out of America\u2019s 127 million households, about 3.7%, or roughly 4.7 million, buy green electricity through different programs. That figure has grown nearly 250% since 2010.\n\nDriving the news: Those numbers are extrapolated from new data out of the Energy Department\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. NREL estimated that in 2018, there were 6.3 million green electricity customers, and around 75% are typically homes.\n\nData: National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Chart: Naema Ahmed/Axios\n\n\u201cThe big idea is to make this easy and simple,\u201d Arcadia's CEO, Kiran Bhatraju, said of choosing renewable power. His goal is to put Arcadia in a position to do for energy consumption what Uber does for transportation, Mint for finances or Kayak for travel.\n\nThe challenge has traditionally been that people care less and engage less with their energy consumption than they do these other things.\n\nThat\u2019s starting to change. Concern about climate change is growing, wind and solar are becoming more readily available and affordable, and some people are beginning to wonder how they can cut their own personal carbon footprint.\n\nHow it works: All electrons flowing through power lines are the same, so being able to specify what kind of energy I'm using is impossible (unless I put solar panels on my roof, as about 1.5% of households do). Arcadia officials describe our power systems to their customers as \"like pouring a bottle of water into a lake and trying to distinguish between the two sources.\"\n\nThat's where \u201crenewable energy certificates,\u201d or RECs, come in. These accounting credits are created when wind and solar farms begin operating, and companies can buy them (individuals can but rarely do) from those who developed the energy.\n\n\u201crenewable energy certificates,\u201d or RECs, come in. These accounting credits are created when wind and solar farms begin operating, and companies can buy them (individuals can but rarely do) from those who developed the energy. Buyers of RECs then can claim ownership over a certain amount of renewable electricity.\n\nThere's a catch, though. RECs aren't necessarily geographically bound. The RECs I purchased through Arcadia are coming from a wind farm in a different part of the country (probably Texas, which has the most wind power). And my actual local electricity mix hasn't changed. Say, what?\n\nYeah, it isn't intuitive, but this is actually how most claims of \"100% renewable energy\" work, via tracking systems overseen by state energy regulators.\n\nThe RECs process raises concerns, including over perceived transparency and whether their purpose is to just track renewable energy or actually encourage more of it.\n\nArcadia Power\u2019s main green offer is 50% wind energy (via RECs) for free by signing up. This is what I chose.\n\nThey also offer 100% wind energy at an additional cost, which ends up being about $10 a month additional on your bill.\n\nAnother feature is a promise that my electricity bill won\u2019t be higher than what it was before, and could be lower. This assumes similar usage! You can\u2019t leave your lights on all day and crank your AC thinking wind and solar power is free \u2014 it\u2019s not.\n\nThe company makes this promise by looking for better electricity rates than from your default utility.\n\nBut it can only offer this in certain states whose electricity systems are competitively based. This is the case in a little under half the country and includes Washington, D.C. and Maryland.\n\nAdditional perks include a user-friendly app showing my power usage breakdown and the ability to pay my bill to my utility via Arcadia using my credit card for no extra charge.\n\nThat selling point may seem trivial, but it\u2019s actually a big draw, because people often prefer paying that way (for points and other reasons). Pepco charges extra for credit card charges.\n\nArcadia and other companies like it have other products too, including the ability to sign up for community solar (akin to your local community garden).\n\nThat\u2019s when a bunch of households pool together \u2014 via a company like Arcadia \u2014 to provide the demand to build a nearby solar project \u2014 on the roof of a local building, for example. State (or the D.C.) government determines the size and amount of community solar.\n\n\u2014 on the roof of a local building, for example. State (or the D.C.) government determines the size and amount of community solar. To that end, it\u2019s a hot commodity. Arcadia has a waiting list for D.C.-area community solar, and another company I talked with \u2014 CleanChoice Energy \u2014 just announced a D.C. community solar project that already filled up.\n\nThis product is usually a pure cost-saver, so people who sign up should see 5% or so off their bills.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Stay tuned for a deeper dive on RECs (try to contain your excitement) and any updates as necessary with my experience with Arcadia Power and like-minded companies.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
