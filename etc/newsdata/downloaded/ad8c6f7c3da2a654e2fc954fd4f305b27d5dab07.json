(AP) - The ball sat on the 3-yard line, forcing top-ranked Clemson into the most unexpected of positions.\n\nGet a stop, or lose the lead late against heavy underdog North Carolina - and maybe the game along with its spot as the front-runner for the College Football Playoff.\n\nThe Tigers did it, stuffing the Tar Heels\u2019 2-point conversion attempt with 1:17 left to hold on for a 21-20 victory - narrowly avoiding an upset that would\u2019ve shaken the national landscape in college football.\n\n\u201cIt came down to one play, that\u2019s what happens a lot of times,\u201d Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cWe made the play we had to make to win the game.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers (5-0, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) had trouble all day in trying to extend earn a program-record 20th straight win. They didn\u2019t go ahead for good until Trevor Lawrence hit Tee Higgins on a 38-yard touchdown pass with 9:54 left, then came up with the stop after the Tar Heels went for the lead instead of a tie after Javonte Williams\u2019 short scoring run.\n\nThe Tigers strung out Sam Howell\u2019s option run to the right, with Xavier Thomas, James Skalski and Nolan Turner combining to bring down Howell as he turned toward the goal line.\n\nHowell tried to pitch the ball back to Dazz Newsome as he was going down, but Newsome had nowhere to go near the sideline and was pushed out of bounds to put the Tar Heels (2-3, 1-1) short and effectively clinch the win for Clemson - though it was far tougher than expected for the 27-point road favorite on what Swinney called \u201ca tough day at the office, no doubt.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably say they probably outplayed us,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cWe made a lot of mistakes, a lot of critical, critical errors at critical times. But when we had to make a play, we made it. That\u2019s what winners do.\u201d\n\nThe Tar Heels certainly gave themselves a shot, jumping on Clemson with a game-opening TD drive for a 7-0 lead - the Tigers largest deficit of the season - and holding the Tigers to a season-low 331 total yards.\n\nIt was Clemson\u2019s lowest point total of its 20-game winning streak, which includes last year\u2019s 15-0 run to a fourth straight ACC title and second national championship in three seasons.\n\nYet the Tar Heels fell to 0-11 against No. 1-ranked teams in The Associated Press college football poll.\n\n\u201cI told the players that we\u2019re not into moral victories,\u201d UNC coach Mack Brown said. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen, because you\u2019ve got to learn to win. \u2026 I told them in my 31 years of coaching, I\u2019ve never been prouder of their effort, because if I\u2019m a reflection of the way those guys fought tonight, then I\u2019m very, very proud of that.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nClemson: The Tigers had made everything look easy through the opening month of the schedule. The closest call had been a 24-10 win against a ranked Texas A&M; team that didn\u2019t reach the end zone in until the final seconds of a game long since decided. But Clemson had all kinds of trouble getting going Saturday, from Travis Etienne\u2019s first-half fumble to set up a UNC touchdown to multiple false-start penalties that continued undercutting the Tigers\u2019 attempts to build momentum. In the end, the Tigers did just enough to stay unbeaten and avoid a shocking upset.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s hard to win,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easy to forget that when you win so many games by so many points. This game is only going to make us better.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels have lost three straight after a 2-0 start in Mack Brown\u2019s return to the program he led more than two decades ago. Their first four games came down to the final drives to make them a tested bunch, and this one unexpectedly followed suit. The defense hung in against the Tigers\u2019 high-powered offense and made Clemson work for everything, while the offense did just enough to stay close before coming up with a 16-play TD drive spanning 8 1/2 minutes to put them on the brink of a historic win.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Tigers have been an overwhelming choice at No. 1 in the AP Top 25, claiming 55 first-place votes in this week\u2019s poll compared to just six for No. 2 Alabama and one for No. 3 Georgia. That support could ebb a bit considering Clemson\u2019s struggles to beat a program that had gone 2-14 in the ACC over the previous two seasons.\n\nTHE BIG PLAY\n\nWilliams\u2019 TD run gave North Carolina the choice of playing for the tie and overtime or taking the chance that the Tar Heels could get those 3 yards for the 2-point conversion.\n\nYet the Tigers also knew the Tar Heels were likely to try it if they scored, and Swinney said his coaching staff even expected some type of option call.\n\n\u201cWe knew the speed option was a play they liked,\u201d said Skalski, one of the three defenders to pull down Howell. \u201cThat\u2019s the key we got and that\u2019s what we read, and \u2026 we made a play.\u201d\n\nHowell was hit shortly after turning inside the 5 as he ran to the right with Newsome following.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a play we\u2019re very confident in,\u201d Howell said. \u201cIn my opinion, it was a good play call. That\u2019s something we liked against them, and they just made a good play on defense.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nClemson: The Tigers have an open date next weekend followed by a visit from Florida State on Oct. 12.\n\nNorth Carolina: The Tar Heels travel to Georgia Tech next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball , http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25 and https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ap-top-25-college-football-podcast\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The ball sat on the 3-yard line, forcing top-ranked Clemson into the most unexpected of positions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aaron Beard"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/clemson_north_carolina_football_97002_c0-102-3684-2249_s1770x1032.jpg?5570e6b4d0473ff8c93c0d9afffb49da4465edcb", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
