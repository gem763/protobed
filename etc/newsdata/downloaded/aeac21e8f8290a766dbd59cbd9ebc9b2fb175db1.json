What can we do about it?\u201d That last part is really what this is about. Author Andrew Marantz wants to explore solutions to the problem of free speech online. I\u2019ll skip over most of the justifications and get right to those solutions, which seem to mostly revolve around new government efforts:\n\nThe Constitution prevents the government from using sticks, but it says nothing about carrots. Congress could fund, for example, a national campaign to promote news literacy, or it could invest heavily in library programming. It could build a robust public media in the mold of the BBC. It could rethink Section 230 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \u2014 the rule that essentially allows Facebook and YouTube to get away with (glorification of) murder. If Congress wanted to get really ambitious, it could fund a rival to compete with Facebook or Google, the way the Postal Service competes with FedEx and U.P.S.\n\nYou can probably imagine what a national campaign for news literacy put together by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would look like. I think I\u2019ll pass on that. A robust public media would, I guess be PBS and NPR on steroids. The BBC produces a lot of non-news programs. Would we somehow be better off if PBS were producing the next Marvel TV show? I\u2019m not sure how that would help.\n\nMarantz seems to envision the creation of a new government-funded social media site to compete with Facebook. Wouldn\u2019t it be harder to deny free speech rights on such a platform given that it\u2019s a taxpayer-funded project and therefore arguably subject to the First Amendment in ways Facebook is not? Could you even ban taxpayers from a taxpayer-funded social media site? I\u2019m thinking that would be difficult to do.\n\nThe alternative he offers is for private companies to step up by banning more \u201cinflammatory accounts.\u201d Having exhausted his suggestions in a few paragraphs, Marantz then turns to his expert witness, a Berkeley professor named John A. Powell:\n\n\u201cWe need to protect the rights of speakers,\u201d John A. Powell, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me, \u201cbut what about protecting everyone else?\u201d Mr. Powell was the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and he represented the Ku Klux Klan in federal court. \u201cRacists should have rights,\u201d he explained. \u201cI also know, being black and having black relatives, what it means to have a cross burned on your lawn. It makes no sense for the law to be concerned about one and ignore the other.\u201d Mr. Powell, in other words, is a free-speech advocate but not a free-speech absolutist. Shortly before his tenure as legal director, he said, \u201cwhen women complained about sexual harassment in the workplace, the A.C.L.U.\u2019s response would be, \u2018Sorry, nothing we can do. Harassment is speech.\u2019 That looks ridiculous to us now, as it should.\u201d He thinks that some aspects of our current First Amendment jurisprudence \u2014 blanket protections of hate speech, for example \u2014 will also seem ridiculous in retrospect.\n\nSomething about this sounded familiar to me. Looking back, I realized I\u2019d written about a very similar piece once before, one which the same author had written for the New Yorker last year. That piece made almost the same argument and also featured John A. Powell as an expert arguing for more limits on speech:\n\n\u201cNo one is disputing how the courts have ruled on this,\u201d john a. powell, a Berkeley law professor with joint appointments in the departments of African-American Studies and Ethnic Studies, told me. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that courts are often wrong.\u201d Powell is tall, with a relaxed sartorial style, and his manner of speaking is soft and serenely confident. Before he became an academic, he was the national legal director of the A.C.L.U. \u201cI represented the Ku Klux Klan when I was in that job,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family was not pleased with me, but I said, \u2018Look, they have First Amendment rights, too.\u2019 So it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand or care deeply about free speech. But what would it look like if we cared just as deeply about equality? What if we weighed the two as conflicting values, instead of this false formalism where the right to speech is recognized but the harm caused by that speech is not?\u201d\n\nAs I noted at the time, Powell is a believer in the idea that speech is harmful. He wrote this in 2017:\n\nThe more we recognize that certain kinds of speech can not only offend but can cause mental and physical harm, and that the harm can be lasting, the more we will be able to properly protect the rights of all\u2014not just of people to speak, but also of their very existence and right to survive and thrive.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen on college campuses, this creates an incentive for adults to behave like fragile snowflakes who claim they will be permanently damaged by words they find offensive. This is how we get safe spaces. More to the point, these ideologues will quickly claim what they really need is for the entire campus to be a safe space by banning anything they don\u2019t want to hear.\n\nThere\u2019s no arguing with this veto power over other people\u2019s speech, no way to appeal it to reason. You can\u2019t tell someone they aren\u2019t being harmed. Harm is a personal declaration not subject to outside review. Once someone claims their \u201clived experience\u201d makes your speech dangerous (to them or unnamed others), you won\u2019t have the right to speak anymore.\n\nIndeed, that\u2019s always what these campus games are about: silencing whoever the far left disagrees with that day. Powell and Marantz can pretend that\u2019s not where this winds up but only by ignoring lots of recent and compelling evidence to the contrary.\n\nUpdate: If social media is killing us, it\u2019s odd that violent crime is down over the past couple of decades. The Netscape web browser was launched in 1994. Facebook was started in 2004.
