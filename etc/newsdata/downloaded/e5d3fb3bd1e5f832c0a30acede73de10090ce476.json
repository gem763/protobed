The ABA\u2019s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary said it interviewed 60 colleagues of Mr. VanDyke who described him as \u201carrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in the knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome interviewees raised concerns about whether Mr. VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community,\u201d read the ABA\u2019s evaluation letter to the committee.\n\nMr. VanDyke said he never expressed any disrespect for such parties who might come before him if he\u2019s confirmed as a federal judge.\n\n\u201cI obviously don\u2019t agree with \u2014 and I don\u2019t think those comments are reflective of the people I worked with throughout my career,\u201d he told the committee.\n\nRepublican lawmakers called the evaluation \u201cshameful\u201d and blasted the ABA for it\u2019s perceived liberal bent.\n\n\u201cThe ABA has essentially called you a homophobic bigot. It\u2019s a deeply serious accusation with no apparent basis in fact,\u201d said Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, Missouri Republican, said the ABA shouldn\u2019t be granted access to reviewing judicial nominees for the White House any longer, saying the organization has displayed political bias.\n\n\u201cI will no longer consider the ABA\u2019s recommendation,\u201d Mr. Hawley said. \u201cTheir shameful performance in this letter, I think, seals the deal beyond any question in my mind.\u201d\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, said the concerns over the ABA evaluation should not be laughed off and suggested the committee probe further into the matter.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility here,\u201d Mr. Whitehouse said. \u201cWe can resolve this by bringing in the ABA folks and letting them explain what the basis is for these charges.\u201d\n\nThe American Bar Association\u2019s William Hubbard told The Washington Times the evaluations are nonpartisan.\n\n\u201cThe Standing Committee provides the Senate, the Administration and the public with candid, confidential assessments of the nominee\u2019s professional qualifications based on interviews with judges, lawyers, and other professionals who know or who have worked with the nominee,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats also raised concerns over Mr. VanDyke\u2019s membership with the National Rifle Association, though, the nominee vowed to cancel his membership if he were to be confirmed to the federal bench.\n\nLiberal advocacy groups raised concerns over his position as solicitor general of Montana, having drafted legal briefs supporting gun rights and pro-life legislation.\n\n\u201cConfirming VanDyke to the Ninth Circuit would be a severe blow to the rights of millions within the circuit, as well as an inexcusable elevation of a person so temperamentally unfit for a judicial role,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice president at the People for the American Way.\n\nConservatives, meanwhile, said Mr. VanDyke is a highly qualified nominee, who demonstrated during the hearing his remarkable character.\n\n\u201cDespite the unfounded, last-minute attacks against him, VanDyke\u2019s testimony forcefully conveyed his commitment to independence, fair treatment for all litigants, and dedication to equal justice under law,\u201d said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network.\n\nMike Davis, president of the Article III Project which supports the president\u2019s judicial nominees, said the ABA evaluator should be investigated for making potentially false statements to Congress, a felony, in the report.\n\n\u201cThe Senate Judiciary should refer this matter to the Justice Department,\u201d Mr. Davis tweeted. \u201cState bars should also open ethics investigations.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
