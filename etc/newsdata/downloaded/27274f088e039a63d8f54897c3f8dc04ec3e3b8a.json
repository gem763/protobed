It was a fun-filled ride with several emotions on the platter.\n\nFor someone who has spent her entire teenage binge-watching rom-coms and reading Mills & Boons from cover to cover, this movie sure has a special place in my heart for more than one reason. I admit, that Imtiaz Ali\u2019s cinema is not something that i relate to. I never went bonkers over Jordan\u2019s passion neither did i understand fifty shades of VIBGYOR of Ved.\n\nFor me, Tara\u2019s persistence and patience to help Ved find a footing in life seldom resonated but what did strike a chord with my heart was Geet. Her over-the-top approach towards life and her awakening to the harsh realities of life was something that I personally underwent as well.\n\nDon't Miss 628 SHARES 34.3 K SHARES 26.5 K SHARES 9.3 K SHARES 8 K SHARES\n\nillustration credits: Ranak Mann\n\nThe beauty of this film was in its simplicity. On the occasion of its 12th anniversary, let\u2019s take a look at several aspects of this film that makes it one of the cinematic gems of the Hindi film industry:\n\nGeet\u2019s story was that of every other girl who lives in her own rom-com bubble until she is tested with the harsh reality of life\n\nYou might sound delusional to your own self, if you haven\u2019t undergone a rude awakening, especially in your love life (or the lack of it). Haven\u2019t we all met a perfect guy who came into our life with a promise of a 'happily ever after' only to break that charade and our heart into a million pieces and teaching us an important lesson, in its wake? Blessed are those who haven\u2019t experienced a bad heartbreak but sagacious are those who actually do because that experience cannot be explained in mere words.\n\ntwitter\n\nGeet, who had the guts to leave everything behind her on a whim, underwent a similar situation when the love of her life turned out to be a casual dater who was just living in the moment and not thinking about a future with her. For him, it wasn\u2019t a love for keeps but a mere chapter in the passing. Her whole transformation from a carefree bubbly girl to a mature young woman was like looking into a mirror for many.\n\nAditya showed that not every guy is a jerk and the other gender is capable of forever and real love.\n\nParallelly, Aditya was going through a phase that was becoming of Geet, much later. Their chance meeting was during that time when he had denounced the world in a way and was on an unknown journey to find himself all over again. He had lost the will to maintain a brave face for the world and wanted to just cut off from everything materialistic around him. This went on to show that men are capable of long-lasting love and even they undergo heartbreak.\n\nNot all of them are stone-hearted as projected. Remember that flushing the picture in the toilet scene? Wasn\u2019t the liberating feeling that Aditya went through afterwards satisfying to watch?\n\nThe underlying comic flavour took the film to new heights. It wasn\u2019t your regular rolling-on-the-floor-laughing comedy but it did give us dozens of chuckles and most of us wreathed in smiles throughout\n\nThe beauty of the film also lies in the fact that it did not have silly one-liners or unnecessary comedy routines. From a ladki ek khuli hui tijori hoti hai to Hotel decent set, it had smart humour that managed to bring a smile on everyone\u2019s faces.\n\ntwitter\n\nWhat\u2019s more the humour was endearing, especially when it came from the late Dara Singh in the form of - meri umar mein ek nazar mein pata chal jata hai.\n\nInterestingly, if you notice closely majority of the characters were given at least one funny line or the other. Geet, obviously, was a powerhouse of entertainment but even her chachaji or cousin Roop had something to contribute as did the receptionist of Hotel Decent.\n\nIn hindsight, It gave us several life lessons. From never losing your inner child to keeping faith that you will find love eventually, it\u2019s never too late to start afresh - this light movie had a lot more to offer than just entertainment.\n\nThey say that the most simple things teach you the most valuable lessons. This movie was a classic example of that. A simple line main apni favourite hoon had such an underlying lesson to teach us - Love and accept yourself with all your flaws. Your relationship with your own self has to be the purest one, only then can you give your hundred percent to all your other relationships.\n\nyoutube\n\nRemember when a somber Geet finally accepts that she lost herself in her relationship with Anshuman and couldn\u2019t recognize her own self for a long time? It was a self-discovery that takes place for many people in real life as well. Depending on when the fog in your brain lifts, that realisation of finding your true self does hit home and at the most unexpected moment in time.\n\nThe OST of the film is evergreen. From party number Mauja Mauja to road trip songs Hum Jo Chalne Lage and Yeh Ishq Haaye, this movie\u2019s music is phenomenal. Every time you listen to these songs, you tend to fall in love with it a tad bit more than you already do.\n\nMusic in most of his films is out-of-the-world, I\u2019ll give Imtiaz Ali that. Not only were Jab We Met\u2019s songs super amazing even the film\u2019s background score was unique. For instance, if the missing train melody is played at the randomest place it\u2019ll take you less than a wink to recognize that it has Geet written all over it. The playlist boasts of some peppy numbers and some very soulful tracks. From Nagada to Aaoge Jab Tum Sajna and Tumse Hi, these songs are evergreen. The best thing is that it had a song tailor made for every situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle antics and many wow moments, there was never a dull moment in the film.This movie did have a cliche yet the most charming narrative\n\nyoutube\n\nFrom the lake jump, meri behen roop ke saath bhaag jao to mujhe karate aata hai, the little details gave us so much happiness that it\u2019s difficult to even comprehend. Not just the direction or the acting, but evey little thing was on point. It changed the life of the actors and the director. It turned out to be Kareena and Shahid\u2019s biggest hit film after a series of dull and drab movies. Imtiaz Ali, who is now obsessed with broken and emotionally fucked up characters experienced his first hit after his critically acclaimed Socha Na Tha. (yes, I deliberately skipped Ahista Ahista, you should too).\n\nFor the uninitiated, this great movie even went on to inspire Hollywood film Leap Year.\n\nLast but not the least, it celebrated love in every true sense of the word.\n\nyoutube\n\nThis film totally endorsed the popular quote:\n\n\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.\u201d\n\nFrom Geet and Aditya\u2019s self-discoveries to the latter finally mending the bridge with his estranged mother, this film came to a full circle.\n\nTo celebrate this movie, it definitely calls for a re-watch, right? Get your weekend started with this masterpiece, folks!", "description": "Main Apni Favourite hoon!
