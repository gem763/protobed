The Red Cross said over 100 people were killed.\n\nRiyadh said the attack was aimed at a \"legitimate military target\" and that the site was not on any no-strike list.\n\nTensions between Riyadh and Tehran have soared since the Iran-backed Huthis claimed responsibility for strikes on Saudi oil installations that knocked out half of the OPEC kingpin's production.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the strikes, which, they said, were carried out with advanced weaponry that was beyond the capability of the Yemeni rebels.\n\nBut in an interview aired on Sunday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said war with Iran would devastate the global economy and he prefers a non-military solution.\n\n\"If the world does not take a strong and firm action to deter Iran, we will see further escalations that will threaten world interests,\" he told the CBS programme \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"Oil supplies will be disrupted and oil prices will jump to unimaginably high numbers that we haven't seen in our lifetimes.\"", "description": "Yemen's Huthi rebels have freed 290 prisoners, including dozens of survivors from a Saudi-led coalition strike on a detention centre earlier this month, the ICRC said Monday.
