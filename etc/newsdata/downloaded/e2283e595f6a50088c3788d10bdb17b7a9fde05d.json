Martin was kind when he said it\u2019s not cinema. He didn\u2019t say it\u2019s despicable, which I just say it is.\u201d\n\n'Of course Marvel is cinema!' Why the Scorsese backlash is justified Read more\n\nScorsese\u2019s initial comments, in which he said films made by Marvel Studios, the Disney offshoot responsible for the Avengers movies, were \u201cnot cinema\u201d, prompted a considerable backlash from directors including James Gunn, Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith and Taika Waititi.\n\nThe director of GoodFellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and forthcoming mafia epic The Irishman reiterated his feelings last weekend at the London film festival, saying superhero films were \u201cinvading\u201d cinema, which increasingly resembled a \u201ctheme park\u201d.\n\nDuring his David Lean lecture on 12 October, Scorsese said: \u201cTheatres have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good, but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense. That is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.\u201d\n\nGunn also responded to Coppola\u2019s attack on the genre for which he has become famous. Writing on Instagram, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy and its sequel tacitly accused both Scorsese and Coppola of being out of touch and insufficiently open-minded. \u201cNot everyone will be able to appreciate [superhero films],\u201d he wrote, \u201ceven some geniuses.\u201d", "description": "The Godfather director joins in criticism of superhero films, while Guardians of the Galaxy\u2019s James Gunn hits back at out-of-touch geniuses", "authors": ["Catherine Shoard"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4897c0807a69b90a8614f0e6af632f4460512963/2169_159_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e38689e534b645938a56afe3501b78f5", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
