The second step is to make actual job cuts, and it feels like we may be seeing the first small signs of that, given talk of HSBC slashing 10,000 positions,\" Mould said.\n\nRobert Walters said its gross profit in the UK fell 11% in the third quarter, while PageGroup's second profit warning of the year followed a 4.1% drop in quarterly earnings in its home market.\n\nThe news pushed shares of other recruitment companies lower, with Hays (L: ), Sthree (L: ) and Swiss-listed Adecco Group (S: ) all down in early trade.\n\nDARK CLOUDS\n\nFears of a global recession has been a particularly dark cloud hanging over the recruitment industry as the protracted U.S.-China trade war and a weakening German economy keep companies on edge.\n\nThe flagging Chinese economy is also having a ripple affect on hiring in countries such as Australia as its export-focused commodities sector goes through a slowdown, Robert Walters finance chief Alan Bannatyne told Reuters.\n\nPageGroup and Robert Walters said business in Hong Kong is also being hurt by the continuing violent protests by pro-democracy activists.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the deterioration in trading conditions seen during Q3 across the majority of our regions is anticipated to continue,\" PageGroup said.\n\nThe company forecast 2019 operating profit in a range of between 140 million pounds ($172.2 million) and 150 million pounds, down from previous guidance of 156.5 million to 168 million pounds.\n\nRobert Walters said it expects annual profit in line with the last year and that it has cut its global headcount by 2% to 4,258.\n\nBannatyne did say he expects business in the UK to bounce back when Brexit developments give companies and candidates some clarity about the future.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to take Britain out of the European Union by Oct. 31 come what may, despite parliament passing a law ordering him to seek a delay if he cannot secure a new transition deal.", "description": "Recruiters pummeled by widespread economic angst", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970KV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
