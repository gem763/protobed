I hope that in certain ways, they connect with your own experience.\u201d\n\nThe website will also feature the philanthropic activities of The William, Jeff, and Jennifer Gross Family Foundation, which has more than $US390 million in assets under management.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "The one-time bond king is warning investors to brace for slow economic growth globally and an end to double-digit annual stock market gains.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6979%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_61%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c5413c46cefc3d6eb527dfce12e992c3c157a389", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
