Here is how the coming weeks could pan out: Tomorrow or Friday: Boris Johnson holds talks with Leo Varadkar in Dublin. October 14: Parliament is due to return for the Queen's Speech. October 17-18: A crunch EU summit in Brussels, but Mr Johnson now seems certain to boycott the event in protest at the bloc's intransigence. October 19: If there is no Brexit deal by this date Remainer legislation obliges the PM to beg the EU for an extension to avoid No Deal. Jeremy Corbyn has said that he will only let Mr Johnson trigger an election after an extension has been secured. If there is a deal, it will start being rushed through Parliament immediately. October 31: The current deadline for the UK to leave the EU. November/December: An election looks inevitable.\n\nThere are claims the EU is considering using the summit next Thursday and Friday to offer the UK an extension lasting just weeks, rather than the three months that had been mooted.\n\nSome member states want to deprive Boris Johnson of the time to hold an election, arguing that if he secures a majority it will put him in a stronger position.\n\nCreating a No Deal 'cliff edge' could maximise the bloc's leverage to force Mr Johnson into an humiliating climbdown.\n\nMr Johnson has insisted he would rather be 'dead in a ditch' than ask the EU for an extension, and vowed to force Brexit by the October 31 deadline.\n\nThe rebel Benn Act lays out that the PM must ask for an extension if an agreement has not been approved by Parliament by October 19.\n\nThe government has given a commitment in the courts that it will obey the legislation, but No10 sources have made clear they still believe there are loopholes.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean-Claude Juncker has warned that No Deal Brexit will 'lead to the collapse of the United Kingdom' as the EU heaped pressure on Boris Johnson to cave to its demands.\n\nThe commission president dismissed suggestions that the bloc will be to blame for failure to get an agreement, jibing that Britain had committed the 'original sin' of trying to leave.\n\nBoth sides are now desperately scrambling to find a way through the impasse, buit with little hope of success before a crunch summit next week.\n\nMr Johnson will hold face-to-face talks with Leo Varadkar in Dublin the coming days, but the Irish PM has accused him of only pretending to make concessions, saying it would be 'very difficult' to get a deal soon.\n\nEuropean Council president Donald Tusk ranted at Mr Johnson on Twitter yesterday in the wake of the row with Mrs Merkel, saying he was playing a 'stupid blame game' and risking the safety of citizens.\n\nAnd in an interview in French newspaper Les Echos, Mr Juncker said it would be the UK's fault if Brexit turned sour.\n\n'If that's the case the explanation is actually in the British camp because the original sin is on the islands and not on the continent,' he said.\n\n'A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent.'\n\nDowning Street last night insisted that hopes of a deal were still alive. Mr Johnson held a 'constructive' 40-minute conversation with Irish premier Leo Varadkar and will meet him for further discussions in the next 48 hours, in what appears to be the last chance for securing a deal.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker (pictured in Brussels today) has dismissed claims that the EU will be to blame for failure to get an agreement, jibing that Britain had committed the 'original sin' of trying to leave\n\nBut ministers were gloomy, and the PM's official spokesman said negotiations were at a 'critical juncture'.\n\nGovernment sources said Mr Johnson could even boycott next week's crunch EU summit rather than suffer a ritual humiliation of the kind dealt out to Theresa May.\n\nThe collapse of the talks would put Mr Johnson on a collision course over whether he can keep his 'do or die' pledge to leave the EU by the end of this month.\n\nNo10 sources said if Brexit was delayed again by Parliament and the courts, the Tories would have 'no choice' but to fight an election on a No Deal ticket to prevent votes haemorrhaging to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\n\nThe clash with Mrs Merkel came as a major setback to Mr Johnson, who believed he had an understanding with EU leaders that they would engage positively with his compromise proposals.\n\nThe PM had hoped that Europe's leading powerbroker would assist in breaking the deadlock, urging her to 'help get this boat off the rocks'.\n\nBut Mrs Merkel told him he would have to settle his differences with Brussels and Ireland.\n\nThe PM's spokesman said the two leaders had a 'frank exchange' \u2013 diplomatic code for a blazing row.\n\nMr Johnson is said to be furious that EU leaders have simply 'banked' his compromises \u2013 which include keeping Northern Ireland in the single market for goods \u2013 without offering any of their own.\n\nIrish foreign minister Simon Coveney said: 'I don't think things have reached an impasse but there are certainly significant gaps to close.'\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson is facing a Cabinet backlash over a threat to cut security ties with EU countries that support a Brexit delay.\n\nIn an incendiary briefing, a 'senior government source' said that backing another extension would be seen by the PM as a 'hostile interference in domestic politics.'\n\nThe source told the Spectator that countries supporting another delay would 'go to the back of the queue' for future co-operation on everything from trade to security.\n\nFormer work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd yesterday named the source as Mr Johnson's chief adviser Dominic Cummings \u2013 a claim that was not denied by No10.\n\nThe comments sparked a backlash, with Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith and Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan both protesting directly to the PM during yesterday's Cabinet meeting.\n\nMr Smith later went public, saying that any threat to limit security co-operation with Ireland because of its stance on Brexit would be 'unacceptable'.\n\nSources said Mrs Morgan complained to Mr Johnson about the briefing, prompting him to respond: 'You shouldn't believe what you read. You should listen to what I say instead.'\n\nUp to five Cabinet ministers are believed to be on 'resignation watch' amid fears they would walk rather than support a shift to campaign for No Deal.\n\nOther backbench MPs could also choose to quit rather than join a push for the UK to make a clean break.\n\nDowning Street accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) of torpedoing a deal", "description": "Boris Johnson will summon MPs, whether or not there is an agreement thrashed out in Brussels the previous day.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/19483138-0-image-a-5_1570613014880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
