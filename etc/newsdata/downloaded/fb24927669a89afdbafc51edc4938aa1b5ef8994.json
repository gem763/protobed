REUTERS/Eric Thayer\n\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham, usually a vocal Trump ally, has repeatedly criticized Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeastern Syria and unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nTheir proposed sanctions would target the assets of senior officials including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, mandate sanctions over Turkey\u2019s purchase of a Russian S-400 missile defense system and impose visa restrictions.\n\nThey also would sanction anyone who conducted military transactions with Turkey or supported energy production for use by its armed forces, bar U.S. military assistance to Turkey and require a report on Erdogan\u2019s net worth and assets.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to have reached a bipartisan agreement with Senator Van Hollen on severe sanctions against Turkey for their invasion of Syria,\u201d Graham said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWhile the Administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Turkish military and Syrian rebel allies launched an operation in Syria on Wednesday with air strikes. Erdogan said the operation aimed to eliminate a \u201cterror corridor\u201d along the Turkish border.\n\nAnkara has branded the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia as terrorists because of their ties to militants who have waged an insurgency in Turkey. But many members of Congress, and U.S. officials, credit the Kurds with fighting alongside American troops to defeat Islamic State militants.\n\nSome House Republicans joined in the condemnation.\n\nRepresentative Liz Cheney, who chairs the House Republican Conference, said Trump\u2019s decision \u201cis having sickening and predictable consequences.\u201d Saying his action aided U.S. adversaries \u201cRussia, Iran and Turkey,\u201d she said lawmakers would respond.\n\n\u201cCongress must and will act to limit the catastrophic impact of this decision,\u201d Cheney said in a statement.\n\nOther Republicans issued statements questioning what they described as Trump\u2019s decision to \u201cabandon\u201d the Kurds.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFIRST VETO OVERRIDE?\n\nSenator Susan Collins called it \u201cterribly unwise,\u201d and added, \u201cToday we are seeing the consequences of that terrible decision. If the reports of Turkish strikes in Syria are accurate, I fear our allies the Kurds could be slaughtered.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the media outlet Axios, Graham predicted that enough Senate Republicans would back sanctions legislation to override a possible Trump veto.\n\nIf so, it would be the first veto override of Trump\u2019s presidency after too few Republicans joined Democrats to muster the two-thirds majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives to override his first five.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s doing this completely against everybody else\u2019s advice,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe will get 100% of the credit if he knows something the rest of us don\u2019t. And he\u2019s going to get 100% of the blame. There\u2019ll be no middle ground.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, Graham warned Ankara of \u201csanctions from hell\u201d if it moved into northern Syria. \u201cWide, deep, and devastating sanctions,\u201d he said.\n\nSenator Jim Risch, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Turkey\u2019s \u201caggressive actions\u201d raised concerns and risked a precipitous decline in relations with Washington.", "description": "U.S. Republicans condemned President Donald Trump's Syria policy on Wednesday after Turkey launched a military operation against Kurdish fighters, a rare break from the White House that had some calling for \"devastating\" sanctions against the NATO ally.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1439020453&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981H6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
