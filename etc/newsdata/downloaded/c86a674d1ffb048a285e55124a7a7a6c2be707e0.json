Unlike many other commentators, I am not at all convinced that they have a point or deserve any sympathy.\n\nAnd I must confess a personal interest. As an infrequent flier, I was uselessly angry a few months ago when their criminal threat to close Heathrow by the use of drones forced me to revise long-cherished travel plans, at a cost of several hundred irrecoverable pounds.\n\nIt was also pleasing to see somebody doing to these pains in the neck what our enfeebled, politicised police are so reluctant to do. If you watch the videos from Canning Town Station carefully, you can hear the authorities instantly conceding defeat to the Warmists without a fight, feebly ordering all passengers to leave the station.\n\nMy heart sang when I first watched the film of arrogant, self-righteous Warmists being pulled off the roof of a London Underground train\n\nHow typical this is, too. Whenever normal people are the victims of anything, somehow it is impossible for the police or the authorities to do anything about it.\n\nAnti-social behaviour in your street? So sorry. We'll drive by for two minutes and then never come back, and that's if you're lucky.\n\nYour neighbour smokes illegal drugs in his back garden and perfumes the air with marijuana? Not interested. Burgled? Fill in a form. Protesters stopping you from earning a living? Sorry, but we're too busy. But a convoy of politicians through the streets comes with an arrogant and bullying escort, all motorbikes, whistles and 'Stay Back!', as if it were Vladimir Putin going by in his special Kremlin lane. And an offended transgender person on Twitter can summon teams of cybercops to descend ferociously on a critic, while a man who calls on the IRA to murder the Cabinet gets a gentle, kindly letter, promising he is not in trouble.\n\nBut once I had stopped gloating for a moment, I watched again. And I saw danger. In October 2019 there is still just enough restraint in a London crowd for the episode not to turn really nasty. The film did not show exactly what happened to the protesters once they were yanked to the ground. I suspect they got quite roughly handled, but they were rescued by cooler heads.\n\nBut how long will this restraint last? I'm told the new Joker film portrays a sinister, malevolent world in a modern setting, and I think that's where we are heading if we are not careful \u2013 blood and flying boots among the skyscrapers. When justice sleeps and authority folds its arms, people eventually decide that there is no further point in obedience or restraint.\n\nBecause the thing is that this general exasperation is widespread on all sides. And if justice is not revived, it will explode.\n\nIt's a while now since I found myself in the murderous hell of Mogadishu, a nightmare come true. But the worst of it was finding out later that, a few short years before, the blasted, dangerous desolation I saw had been a prosperous, civilised cityscape of well-dressed people, smart cars and white-gloved traffic police. Barbarism is never as far away as you think.\n\nComing soon: \u00a340m of God-hating TV\n\nPeople will watch almost anything on TV nowadays (see the mad, inexplicable drivel of Peaky Blinders), but will they be able to sit through yet another attempt to dramatise Sir Philip Pullman's heavy-handed anti-Christian fables, much loved by God-hating liberal parents who buy them by the ton for their innocent children?\n\nThe wholly impartial BBC, in partnership with HBO, have spent a rumoured \u00a340 million, much of it yours, trying to give the kiss of life to His Dark Materials. It is hard to see why, since a Hollywood version, The Golden Compass, died of boredom in the cinema.\n\nSir Philip has long sought (in his own words) to undermine the basis of the Christian faith, and he means it. The knighted atheist was so moved a few months ago that he tweeted: 'When I hear the name 'Boris Johnson' for some reason the words 'rope' and 'nearest lamp-post' come to mind.' It took him a while to grasp that this was a mistake and delete it. It is hard to think of the BBC devoting so much time and effort to the works of any non-liberal who tweeted anything like that, however many times he said sorry.\n\nCan the licence fee last much longer if the BBC behaves like this? Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan certainly frightened the Corporation when she mused the other day that it might become a voluntary subscription service, like Netflix. I'd personally be very sorry if this happens, but the licence fee is given in return for a pledge of fairness. And if the BBC won't be fair, it will lose it, possibly sooner than it thinks.\n\nPeople will watch almost anything on TV nowadays (see the mad, inexplicable drivel of Peaky Blinders), but will they be able to sit through yet another attempt to dramatise Sir Philip Pullman's heavy-handed anti-Christian fables, much loved by God-hating liberal parents who buy them by the ton for their innocent children?\n\nNorthern Ireland is on the way out\n\nWhatever eventually happens between this country and the EU, one thing is permanently clear. Northern Ireland is now a semi-detached part of the UK, and moving rapidly out of it. The DUP cannot stop this, only delay it.\n\nAnd the reason is that the Union was dealt a fatal blow by the Blair Creature's much-praised surrender to the IRA in 1998. The IRA, and the Dublin government, and the White House, and the EU all grasped at this point that Britain had lost the will to hang on to Northern Ireland. Our final departure is only a matter of time.\n\nThe SNP also took careful note of an event that has obvious implications for Scotland.\n\nOnly the British people, who could not be told we'd been beaten, needed to be fed the line that we had won a great victory and all would now be peace and happiness. I can see why many still want to believe this hogwash, but now that we have conceded a customs border between us and Belfast, and now that it's clear that we can't stop the prosecutions of British soldiers for alleged crimes during the Troubles, the truth really ought to sink in. This will soon be the first time since 1945 that territory has changed hands in Western Europe as a reward for violent aggression.\n\nPounds, shillings and reminiscence\n\nWhen I visited the superb William Blake exhibition at London's Tate Britain (the proper one, not the huge shed full of modern pseudo-art), I was struck by a label that informed me solemnly that in Blake's day (1757-1827) the pound was divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence.\n\nIn Blake's day! I'm still very glad to say that I too, not dead yet, was lucky enough to live in the era of proper money, when, as George Orwell put it, the coins were heavier and the beer was bitterer. He said there was 'something distinctive and recognisable in English civilisation \u2013 solid breakfasts and gloomy Sundays, smoky towns and winding roads, green fields and red pillar-boxes. It has a flavour of its own. Moreover it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living creature'.
