They say the party shouldn\u2019t take the White House\u2019s bait, arguing that the president\u2019s defenders will simply find other reasons to not comply with the inquiry.\n\nThe \u201cprivate\u201d debate on whether or not to hold a vote \u201cis threatening to cleave Democrats\u2019 unified front\u201d in favor of impeachment, the news outlet added.\n\nRep. John Yarmuth (D-KY) publicly called for a vote, telling Politico,\u201cIf Nancy asked me, I would say sure, let\u2019s have a vote. Everybody\u2019s on record, so they\u2019re not going to vote any differently. What\u2019s the danger in having a vote to formalize it?\u201d\n\nHouse lawmakers voted to allow an investigation into whether to impeach President Bill Clinton and President Richard Nixon. Republicans have pointed to those votes as evidence that Democrats are acting in an unfair and illegitimate manner.\n\nPolitico noted:\n\nDemocrats have long argued that they don\u2019t need a vote to launch formal impeachment proceedings, even if that had been the practice in prior presidential impeachment processes. In fact, House lawyers backed by Pelosi have made that argument in a succession of court cases seeking evidence to support their impeachment inquiry, and proponents of that position worry a formal vote would undercut their legal claims. Similarly, Democrats are worried that a near-term floor vote would drive away a handful of Republicans who are wavering over whether to support impeachment proceedings. A party-line vote would hand the White House another talking point, they argue: that impeachment is a purely partisan effort by Democrats.\n\nIn a letter to Pelosi and the House chairmen pursuing the impeachment inquiry, the White House said the Democrats were conducting a \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d and \u201cillegitimate\u201d impeachment probe that absolves lawmakers of \u201ctaking political accountability.\u201d\n\nThe White House said it would not cooperate with the ongoing \u201cpartisan\u201d impeachment investigation. Although the letter stopped short of explicitly calling on Pelosi to hold a vote, it all but dared the Speaker to do so.\n\nMost of the 235 members of the House Democratic Caucus support the impeachment probe, but there are still eight who did not, as of Thursday afternoon, a tally from the New York Times revealed.", "description": "Some House Democrats are privately calling on Pelosi to hold a vote to formalize the impeachment inquiry to undermine Republican criticism.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Pelosi-Head-Down-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
