Not only has he got to send the letter, he\u2019s got to apply for an extension. And to send the letter and then try and neutralise it seems to me to be plainly a breach of the act.\u201d\n\nA Downing Street source said: \u201cWe intend to sabotage any extension. The \u2018surrender bill\u2019 only kicks in if an extension is offered. Once people realise our plans, there is a good chance we won\u2019t be offered a delay. Even if we are, we intend to sabotage that too.\u201d\n\nSumption said he had read the bill and there was not \u201cthe slightest obscurity\u201d about what the government was obliged to do. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to realise that the courts are not very fond of loopholes. They\u2019re going to interpret this act in a way that gives effect to its obvious purpose unless there\u2019s something in the act that makes it completely impossible to do so and there isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSumption said Johnson would not only be in contempt of court if he failed to do what the bill states, he risked the resignation of the justice secretary, the attorney general, and other members of his cabinet.\n\nHe added there were \u201cplenty of ways\u201d in which this kind of obligation can be enforced. \u201cAn application will have to be made to the court for an injunction. The simplest way of enforcing the injunction would be for the court simply to direct an official to sign the letter on behalf of the PM and to declare that his signature was to be treated in every legal respect as equivalent to the prime minister\u2019s,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe Conservative MP Nigel Evans said Johnson was more likely to call for a vote of no confidence in his own government or try to force an election via another means than to go to Brussels to ask for an article 50 extension.\n\nThe joint executive secretary of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs told the Today programme: \u201cI cannot see under the current circumstances Boris Johnson going to Brussels and asking for that extension.\u201d", "description": "PM\u2019s reported plan to persuade EU to reject request for article 50 extension would be illegal, says ex-supreme court judge", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b9b977c0c792b905e533a59bfe414e6f3713ec/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=663e6697382eb2da96f715d67c26c092", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
