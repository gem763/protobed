That\u2019s around 53+ hours in four days. That\u2019s not including the 1.5 hours she\u2019s in the car each day. She usually doesn\u2019t get a chance to eat lunch or even drink much water. (& she has to dress like a blueberry.. I mean, come on). She is so good at what she does that she often forgets how to take care of herself while she\u2019s taking care of her patients.\u201d\n\nThe post then went on to say that the photo was actually snapped in July, and that Caty had assisted in the delivery of a stillborn baby.\n\n\u201cThis pic is from a night back in July where she came to my house after a particular hard day,\u201d McIntyre wrote. \u201cShe delivered a stillborn. Have you guys ever really thought about what a labor and delivery nurse sees? They see great joy in smooth deliveries and healthy moms and babies. They see panic and anxiety when a new mom is scared. They see fear when a stat C-section is called.\"\n\n\"They see peace when the mom has support from her family \u2013 [because] not all new moms do. They see teenagers giving birth. They see an addicted mom give birth to a baby who is withdrawing. They see [Child Protective Services] come,\" she continued. \"They see funeral homes come. Did you know that they have to make arrangements for the funeral home to come pick up the baby? I didn\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nNURSE RETURNS TO WORK AT HOSPITAL WHERE SHE WAS TREATED FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER\n\nThe post closed by thanking Caty and all other nurses for their hard work that often goes unseen.\n\n\u201cCaty (& all other nurses) \u2013 you are SPECIAL. You bless your patients and their families more than you will ever know,\u201d McIntyre wrote. \u201cThank you for all that you do.\u201d\n\nMcIntyre\u2019s post, which has been shared more than 96,000 times to date, also racked up thousands of comments, with many relaying their own special experiences with nurses.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cNurses are beyond amazing people! They are angels on earth,\u201d one commenter, Katie Burns, wrote.\n\n\u201cThank you for being so strong and brave for people during what should be the most amazing time but unfortunately is the most devastating,\u201d another commenter wrote. \u201cYou all carry that burden, massive respect for all that you do.\u201d", "description": "Her sister revealed that she had just wrapped up four days worth of work that included assisting in the delivery of a stillborn baby.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Caty-Nixon-Laura-McIntyre.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
