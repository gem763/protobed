Ballena noticed the animal \u201chad a fishhook stuck in its leg, and several large gashes elsewhere on its body,\u201d the shelter said. He estimated the fox was about a year old.\n\nBallena used a piece of equipment known as a \u201ccontrol pull\u201d to keep the fox from biting him as he cut the wire on the fishhook. The fishhook and the wire had gotten stuck to the bush, officials said.\n\nBallena then took the fox to Wildlife Vet Care, where he underwent surgery to get the hook out and to stitch other cuts on his legs. Officials with the wildlife group said the fox probably \u201cinjured himself trying to escape the bush,\u201d according to Chelsea Jones, a spokeswoman with the Animal Welfare League of Arlington.\n\nThe fox is doing well and will be released \u201cback into the wild very soon\u201d when its stitches heal, according to the animal welfare group.\n\nAD", "description": "An animal control officer found the fox \u201chad a fishhook stuck in its leg, and several large gashes elsewhere on its body.\u201d", "authors": ["Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/F2iSCxQf6652hl7Jv7cWNh3zZ94=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FOPTWCKESBGXHJX75EUSBLG7NI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
