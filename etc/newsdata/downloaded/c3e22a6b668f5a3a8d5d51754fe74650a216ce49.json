Hunter Biden\u2019s work for Popoviciu went unreported, but at the time, then-Vice President Joe Biden was a leader in anti-corruption efforts for Romania.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN GOT $83G PER MONTH FOR UKRAINE 'CEREMONIAL' GIG: REPORT\n\nWhile NBC reported that there was no evidence that either Biden violated the law, critics have pointed to the arrangement as another example of Hunter Biden getting involved in efforts to help foreign figures avoid prosecution while his father was leading the charge to target corrupt individuals and practices.\n\nMeanwhile, reports surrounding Hunter Biden\u2019s connection to a fraudulent bond scheme are also surfacing and raising new questions about how the younger Biden was viewed during the time of his father\u2019s vice presidency.\n\nBiden\u2019s name was reportedly involved as a selling point in a $60 million securities fraud based on bonds issued by a company affiliated with a Native American tribe in South Dakota, according to the Wall Street Journal. The funds were reportedly supposed to be used for certain projects but were instead used for the personal finances of Jason Galanis. Earlier this month, Fox News' Tucker Carlson first reported details relating to this case, saying, \"Hunter Biden wasn't charged in that case, but his name was used to promote the fraudulent scheme and lend it legitimacy.\"\n\nGalanis pleaded guilty to securities fraud in the case and was sentenced in 2017 to more than 14 years in prison. But one of Galanis\u2019 co-conspirators in the arrangement, according to the Journal, was Devon Archer\u2014a longtime friend and business partner of Hunter Biden.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Daily Caller, someone convicted in the scam said: \"You see that this is who we\u2019re doing business with? You don\u2019t get more politically connected and make people more comfortable than that.\u201d That's believed to be a reference to the younger Biden and his father\u2019s role in the Obama administration.\n\nAccording to the Journal, Archer\u2019s attorney said during the 2018 trial that the younger Biden \u201cwas part of this deal.\u201d A federal jury in Manhattan convicted Archer and two others of fraud last year, but later overturned the verdict against Archer.\n\nBiden and Archer have had a long-standing business relationship and even sat on the board together of the now-controversial Ukrainian natural gas firm, Burisma Holdings. Biden's work with the firm is at the center of Trump's original request to Ukraine.\n\nA source familiar with the situation told Fox News on Monday that Biden and Archer are no longer business partners.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House is dealing with new headaches, as the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine told congressional investigators last week that the administration linked U.S. military aid to the president\u2019s call for politically-related investigations in Kiev.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN'S QUESTIONABLE PAST AND BUSINESS DEALINGS COULD UNDO DAD'S BID FOR WHITE HOUSE\n\nDiplomat Bill Taylor was referring to the now-famous phone call on July 25 between Trump and Zelensky, during which Trump pressed for Biden-related investigations.\n\nAccording to Taylor\u2019s testimony, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland informed top Ukrainian aid Andriy Yermak weeks after the call that \u201csecurity assistance money would not come until \u201cPresident Zelensky committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nDuring the call with Zelensky, Trump is said to have pressured him to launch an investigation into the former vice president and his son\u2014specifically their business dealings in Ukraine and the ex-Ukrainian prosecutor\u2019s investigation into alleged corruption by the founder of Burisma.\n\nMykola Zlochevsky, a founder of Burisma and former minister of ecology and natural resources in Ukraine, was being investigated by then-prosecutor Viktor Shokin over allegations of corruption. At the time, Biden was spearheading the Obama administration\u2019s Ukraine policy and successfully pressured ex-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire Shokin, amid the Burisma investigation.\n\nEarlier this month, Fox News obtained notes from a private interview conducted by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani with Shokin, who told him that he was told to back off the investigation involving Burisma, and that his \u201cinvestigations stopped out of fear of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Shokin attempted to continue the investigations but on or around June or July of 2015, the U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey R. Pyatt told him that the investigation has to be handled with white gloves, which according to Mr. Shokin, that implied do nothing,\u201d the notes from the interview stated. The notes also claimed Shokin was told Biden had held up U.S. aid to Ukraine over the investigation.\n\nShokin was fired in April 2016, and his case was \u201cclosed by the current Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko,\u201d according to the notes. Despite his claims, Shokin, on both sides of the Atlantic, had been widely accused of corruption.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that Hunter Biden receives a salary, commission plus one million dollars,\u201d Shokin said, according to the notes.\n\nThe notes added that \u201cPresident of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko told Mr. Shokin not to investigate Burisma as it was not in the interest of Joe and/or Hunter Biden. Mr. Shokin was called into Mr. Poroshenko\u2019s office and told that the investigation into Burisma and the Managing Director where Hunter Biden is on the board, has caused Joe Biden to hold up one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nShokin then told Giuliani, according to the notes, that \u201cin or around April of 2016\u201d Poroshenko \u201ctold him he had to be fired as the aid to the Ukraine was being withheld by Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nBiden reportedly threatened to withhold $1 billion in critical U.S. aid if Shokin was not fired, though Biden repeatedly denied it had anything to do with Hunter Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, the House impeachment inquiry against Trump was launched after a whistleblower first complained about the contents of Trump\u2019s phone call to the intelligence community inspector general in August, stating the call seemed to show the president soliciting a foreign power to help in influencing the 2020 presidential election by opening an investigation into his political opponent.\n\nThis has since led to a parade of witnesses testifying behind closed doors about the president's effort to pressure Ukraine, including allegations that he held back military aid as leverage.\n\nThe White House and the president\u2019s allies have maintained there was no such quid pro quo, though Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, provided testimony last week indicating the contrary.\n\nAs for Trump's focus on corruption involving the Bidens, the former vice president hit back on Sunday night on CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\"\n\n\"You wanna deal with corruption? Start to act like it,\" Biden said. \"Release your tax returns or shut up.\"", "description": "More questions are emerging about Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings -- fueled by new revelations related to his work in Ukraine, Romania\u00a0and an alleged fraudulent bond scheme --\u00a0even as the House impeachment inquiry is dealing a series of significant blows to President Trump.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
