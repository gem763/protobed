This one has a maximalist, on-the-nose charm that would make everyone\u2019s favorite host \u2014 Amy Sedaris \u2014 proud.\n\nGreat Jones, the brand of very pretty pots and pans helmed by Sierra Tishgart (a former Grub Street editor) and Maddy Moelis, partnered with the ethical fashion brand Zuri on a block-printed, pink and orange dress. It\u2019s decorated with Great Jones\u2019s eternally instagrammable dutch oven, the Dutchess. Given that Great Jones became well known in part because of its gorgeous attention to design and savvy social-media presence, it\u2019s not super surprising that the brand has branched out into clothing. Food is having a fashion moment. And it\u2019s impressive that Zuri turned a pot print into something that looks playful in a modern way, not a granny way.\n\nFittingly, they all celebrated in style, with a party at Tishgart\u2019s apartment attended by designer Susan Alexandra and Bon Appetit star Molly Baz. Moonlynn Tsai, a chef at Kopitiam, served coconut rice topped with dried anchovies, oyster omelets, and a delicious milk-bread sandwich filled with thick, coconut-y kaya jam. If that inspires you to host a dinner party, go to a farmer\u2019s market, or make your own indulgent sandwich, consider wearing a Zuri dress to fully match the vibe.\n\nZuri The Dutchess Dress Available in sizes XXS-XL. $145 at Zuri Buy\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Great Jones Goods, the cookware brand, has partnered with sustainable brand Zuri on a dress decorated with Dutch Ovens.
