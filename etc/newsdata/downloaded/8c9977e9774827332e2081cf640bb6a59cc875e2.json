It was last cancelled in 2003 during the SARS outbreak.\n\nThe wave of protests in Hong Kong was sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have since morphed into a larger movement for democracy and police accountability.\n\nThe city enjoys unique rights under the terms of its handover to China by Britain in 1997, including freedom of expression and an independent judiciary, but many believe these are under threat from an increasingly assertive Beijing.\n\nStreet battles between riot police and small groups of protesters \u2014 whose vandalism has targeted companies they consider to be pro-Beijing \u2014 have become a weekly occurrence, hammering the already struggling economy, spooking tourists and undermining Hong Kong\u2019s reputation for stability.\n\nThe crisis has already forced the cancellation of the WTA Hong Kong Open tennis tournament and the postponement of a football friendly at home against Malaysia.\n\nSeveral high-profile entertainment events \u2014 from pop concerts and stand-up comedy shows to award-winning musicals \u2014 have been scrapped as well.\n\nOrganisers of the mixed martial arts event HK4 also announced on Wednesday a postponement to March next year, citing safety concerns during the ongoing protests.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 The Hong Kong Squash Open has become the latest international sports event to be called off because of the unprecedented political", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/d61cb2_hong-kong-has-shaken-by-months-massive-pro-democracy-protests-hong-kong-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
