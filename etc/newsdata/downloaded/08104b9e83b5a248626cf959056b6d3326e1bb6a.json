With this in mind, we used TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy tool to narrow down the 3 top stocks that represent the most compelling investments in the current economic climate. All of these stocks have the Street\u2019s backing as each has received a recent ratings upgrade and earned a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d consensus, based on all of the ratings assigned to the stock over the last three months.\n\nPlanet Fitness (PLNT)\n\nDespite some recent shakiness after management stated 2H19 comps will decelerate during its second quarter earnings conference call, one top analyst just gave the fitness chain a ratings boost.\n\nImperial Capital\u2019s George Kelly believes the \u201cbest in class fitness operator\u201d is a growth stock based on its solid fundamentals. In the latest quarter, the company posted revenue of $181.7 million which represented a 29% year-over-year gain. Not to mention, the company boasts 14 million guests which utilize its fitness centers.\n\nThat being said, more gains could be in store thanks to its new locations and higher pricing. With the company opening more centers this year than ever before and its introduction of more Black Card services as well as membership tiers, its long-term growth narrative appears strong.\n\nAll of this lends itself to Kelly\u2019s conclusion that PLNT \u201coffers much value at its current pricing relative to competitors\u201d which include Crunch and The Edge Fitness. This prompted the five-star analyst to upgrade the rating to a Buy and set a $72.50 price target, which puts the upside potential at 20%. (To watch Kelly\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThe rest of the Street is even more bullish on PLNT. With 6 Buy ratings and 1 Hold received in the last three months, the stock is clearly a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 among analysts. The upside potential also comes in at 36% based on its $82 average price target.

The company, which is up 19% year-to-date, looks like a long-term winner according to several Wall Street analysts.\n\nWhile its shift from license based software to subscription based initially posed a cause for concern among some investors, the transition appears to be going much more smoothly than expected. At the beginning of the year, management guided subscription revenue landing at 10% of total license revenues. However, investors got a pleasant surprise as the company delivered subscription revenue which made up 31% of license revenue in its first quarter. Its next quarter saw a similar result with subscriptions contributing to 56% of the license revenue mix.\n\n\u201cSubscription transition continues to happen faster than expected. We believe VRNS will report a quarter like their last two, a higher anticipated mix of subscription revenue and raised mix guidance,\u201d Craig-Hallum analyst Chad Bennett explained. He now expects that subscriptions will account for between 65%-75% of total license revenue as VRNS exits 2019.\n\nOn top of the success of its altered business model, data obtained by Craig-Hallum indicates demand for its new subscription model remains healthy. This makes sense as a subscription based model reduces customers\u2019 upfront investment so buying multiple products is more attractive.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Given the renewed sense of optimism, investors are looking for fresh investments to spruce up their portfolios.
