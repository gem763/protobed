It sounds like he has a secret plan he doesn\u2019t want to reveal,\u201d Pallone said. \u201cCould you just tell us some information \u2026 in the event that he is successful in this awful lawsuit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get into specifics about the plan,\u201d Verma said. \u201cWe have planned for a number of different scenarios, but we need to hear from the courts.\"\n\nA federal appeals court is poised to rule in the coming days or weeks whether to uphold a lower court\u2019s ruling that the entire law is unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit was originally brought by a coalition of conservative state attorneys general, and is backed by the administration. The administration has argued the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees that the law is unconstitutional, an appeal to the Supreme Court in the heart of election season would be likely. To date, administration officials have said the law would remain in place, no matter what the court rules, as the legal process plays out.\n\nAs recently as Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said his agency was \u201cnot worried\u201d about the decision coming from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, and emphasized there would be no disruption for the upcoming open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cOur message would be, \u2018Keep calm and carry on,\u2019\u201d Azar said when asked about the impact of the pending decision. \u201cThere will be no immediate disruption to anybody. We will run the program the day after such a ruling the same way we ran the program the day before.\u201d", "description": "One of President Trump\u2019s top health officials on Wednesday repeatedly declined to detail the administration\u2019s plan if a court rules ObamaCare is unconstitutional.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/vermaseema_020917getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
