Calling himself \u201canon,\u201d he said he was a Holocaust denier, and launched into a rambling tirade. \u201cFeminism is the cause of declining birth rates in the West, which acts as a scapegoat for mass immigration, and the root of all these problems is the Jew,\u201d he said, according to these reports. The video has since been removed.\n\nPolice said they have arrested one of the suspects and told the city\u2019s residents to stay inside for the afternoon. They also confirmed that two people with bullet wounds have been taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nIn response to the shooting, German cities like Leipzig, Dresden, Berlin and Frankfurt \u2014 and even other cities across Europe \u2014 have increased police protection in front of synagogues, schools and cemeteries.\n\nChristoph Heubner, the Vice President of the international Auschwitz Committee, is cited in Bild saying, \u201cthat an attack against Jewish people can take place in Germany on the most important holiday in Judaism is a deep pain for survivors, which reminds them of the darkest and most murderous times of anti-semitism in Germany.\u201d\n\n\u201c This attack is the next level of extreme-right terror in Germany. \u201d \u2014 Christoph Heubner of the international Auschwitz Committee\n\nAn eye witness, 28-year-old Konrad R\u00f6ssler, told the news channel NTV that he was standing inside the Kiez D\u00f6ner kebab shop on Ludwig-Wucherer-Stra\u00dfe, when a man dressed in green military gear and a helmet approached the shop with an assault rifle in his arms. The man \u201cthrew something like a grenade\u201d at the shop, said the man, which hit the door frame and exploded. \u201cThen he shot into the store at least once... I guessed that the man behind me was killed.\u201d\n\nIsmet Tekim, who works at Kiez D\u00f6ner, told Bild that he was just walking back to the shop during the attack. \u201cI saw a guy, his face covered, shooting around the area wildly. Then he threw himself behind a car and shot at the police, who shot back. Then he got into his car.. it is so tragic what happened. The man (who was killed) only wanted to eat a kebab at ours.\u2019\n\nAn eyewitness told MDR that outside the Jewish cemetery on Humboltstrasse, a man dressed in military clothes and a helmet opened fire with a machine gun and a shotgun. One woman was killed. Eye witnesses also reported hearing explosions. The men reportedly carried homemade explosive devices, which they detonated at the cemetery and in front of the synagogue.\n\nAfter the attack at the cemetery, one of the suspects tried to enter the nearby synagogue. Some 70 to 80 people were inside at the time of the attack.\n\nMax Privorotzki, the head of the Jewish community in Halle, told the Stuttgarter Zeitung that he saw from the synagogue\u2019s outside camera \u201cthat a heavily armed perpetrator with a steel helmet and a gun tried to shoot open our doors.\u201d The shooter could not get into the building. \u201cWe barricaded the doors from inside and waited for the police,\u201d Privorotzki said.\n\nPrivorotzki has spoken in the past about an increase in anti-semitic incidents in Halle. \u201cLately people aren\u2019t hiding it,\u201d he told a local newspaper in 2017.\n\nShots also were reported to have been fired in Landsberg, a city 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) from Halle. As in Halle, police told people to stay in their homes or indoors and to stay away from windows and doors and to turn on the news.\n\nPolice have not released any information about the suspects or their motives. But the federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Karlsruhe, which usually takes over terror probes, has announced that it will be taking over the case. The prosecutor\u2019s spokeswoman told the evangelical news outlet Evangelischer Pressedienst that there are sufficient grounds for a possible right-extremist background to the murders.\n\nIn an interview with Tagesspiegel in March this year, prosecutor general Peter Frank said that the number of right-wing terror cases in which his office was currently prosecuting was \u201cin the double digits.\u201d\n\nFrank warned that, \u201cWe are watching an increasing radicalization in the field of right-wing extremism. Verbally, but also in the propensity for violence.\u201d Since then, the federal prosecutor has also taken over the case of Walter L\u00fcbcke, the local conservative politician who was shot dead outside his house this summer by a neo-Nazi whose xenophobic criminal record dates back to the 1990s.\n\nIn the interview, Frank also spoke about the riots in the eastern city of Chemnitz last September, where neo-Nazis joined employees of the radical right wing party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) to protest against foreigners and chase any foreign-looking people, while the local police did nothing.\n\nThe federal prosecutor\u2019s office also said that it is investigating all possible motives. Heubner said in Bild, \u201cAfter Chemnitz and the murder of Walter L\u00fcbcke, this attack is the next level of extreme-right terror in Germany. We now expect swift measures from a fortified state, that must in particular look at how the extreme-right scene is arming itself.\u201d", "description": "One of two alleged killers appeared on Twitch to expound his reasons for hating immigrants and Jews.
