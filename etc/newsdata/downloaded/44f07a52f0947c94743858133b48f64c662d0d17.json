However, Cisco hasn't released a patch to address the issue, suggesting it's not a vulnerability but a configuration issue. However, it has offered recommendations to ensure attackers can abuse this API.\n\nCequence Security, a US company focusing on application security, has detailed what it calls the 'Prying-Eye vulnerability', which also affects video collaboration company Zoom.\n\nZoom had its IPO in April and in July caused a stir after it appeared to ignore a legitimate bug report that its web server exposed Mac users to remote attacks.\n\n\"The Prying-Eye vulnerability is an example of an enumeration attack that targets web-conferencing APIs with a bot that cycles through (enumerates) and discovers valid numeric meeting IDs,\" Cequence explained in a blogpost.\n\n\"If the common user practice of disabling security functionality or not assigning a password is followed, then the bad actor would be able to view or listen to an active meeting.\"\n\nTo make it easier for participants to join, those setting up a meeting often don't require them to use a password. But if companies know a conversation could involve the exchange of sensitive information, it could be wise for them to protect the meeting with a password.\n\nIn Cisco's case, Webex Meetings uses a nine-digit identifier that participants can use to join a meeting from smartphones and desktops. It notes the potential security issue mostly affects meetings that aren't password-protected.\n\n\"If the attacker was to join the meeting using this information, they would still be listed as a participant and could be expelled by the host,\" Cisco says.\n\n\"For password-protected meetings, the attacker could recover the meeting number, but would not be able to uncover the meeting title, schedule or host name, or join the meeting.\"\n\nThe company notes that the default configuration makes it mandatory to use a password when users are setting up a meeting.\n\nWebex also offers a default, randomly generated password when setting up a meeting in sites that do not mandate password protection. Customers can ditch the randomly generated one and share an easier, user-created password or disable password protection if the site allows it.", "description": "Few use passwords to protect video conferences, but a snooping flaw suggests they should even if it's a hassle.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/04/18/3c85ed1e-2d05-42eb-9c67-948ef77a9bbe/thumbnail/770x578/24593b74196ded4e87e974ecf50d979f/webex2.jpg"}
