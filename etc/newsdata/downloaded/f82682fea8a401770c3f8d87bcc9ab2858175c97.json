Uber's shares are down 24% since the company debuted earlier this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMIXED RESULTS\n\nThe only bright spot for Goldman was its institutional client services business, which accounts for more than a third of its overall revenue, but a 6% growth at the unit was not enough to offset weakness in its other major businesses.\n\n\"Overall, GS posted mixed results this quarter. While the top line beat to us was a positive, it was driven by more trading which tends to be less persistent and investment banking results were weak,\" analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nBond trading revenue was up 8%, while equities rose 5%. JPMorgan also reported a surge in bond trading.\n\nWall Street's biggest banks are facing several challenges in growing their revenue, largely as concerns of slowing growth have deterred companies from tapping public markets for funds, but Chief Executive David Solomon sounded optimistic on a call with analysts.\n\n\"The IPO process is alive and well in the United States,\" he said.\n\nUnder Solomon, Goldman has undertaken a major shift in strategy from its focus on trading to building a bigger consumer business in a bid to shield its revenue from wild swings in financial markets.\n\nGoldman, which recently launched a credit card with Apple, has also attempted to build out new businesses, but top executives at the bank have warned in previous quarters that those efforts will take time to bear fruit.\n\nSolomon has pushed his top lieutenants to bring in at least $5 billion of new revenue from those businesses by 2020, while simultaneously conducting a full-scale review of the business that has led to a number of new efficiency initiatives and a culling of its partnership pool of top executives.\n\nThe bank's net earnings applicable to common shareholders fell 27% to $1.79 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.45 billion a year ago. Earnings per share fell to $4.79 from $6.28 a year earlier.\n\nTotal net revenue fell 6% to $8.32 billion.\n\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $4.81 per share and revenue of $8.31 billion, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.\n\nExpectations from most brokerages tracking the investment bank were generally muted as macroeconomic conditions have been weighing on investor sentiment.\n\nGoldman's main rival Morgan Stanley is expected to report quarterly results on Thursday.
