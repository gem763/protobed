The announcement comes after about 800 union delegates representing every school in the district met behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cStrike will be a last resort,\u201d Jesse Sharkey, president of the union, said during a Wednesday evening press conference, adding that the group is trying to reach a negotiated settlement. \u201cThe city can afford our demands.\u201d\n\nAbout 94% of Chicago Teachers Union members voted last week to authorize a strike to demand higher pay, more support staff like nurses and social workers and better working conditions. Union and district representatives are still negotiating, with school officials enhancing their offer, according to the district.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for a settlement that\u2019s in the district budget, and the district is able to sustainably fund the contract,\u201d said John Ceffalio, a credit analyst for AllianceBernstein Holding LP, which holds $45 billion in municipal assets including Chicago and the city\u2019s school bonds. \u201cIf it is more expensive, how are they going to fund it?\u201d\n\nThe teachers union has rejected the district\u2019s offer for a 16% pay increase over five years and has said its plan for adding support staff falls short. The standoff comes at the same time that city park district workers and other school staff like security guards are also planning to strike at the same time, leaving Mayor Lori Lightfoot facing multiple walkouts this month. The parks have come to agreement with 24 of its 25 union but no deal has been made with SEIU Local 73, which represents two-thirds or 2,400 workers, the district said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are going to stick together,\u201d Sharkey said.\n\nContingency Plans\n\nSchool buildings will be open on normal schedules to give students \u201ca safe place to go should a work stoppage occur,\u201d on Oct. 17, according to the Chicago Public School\u2019s contingency plan.\n\n\u201cWhile we are doing everything in our power to reach a fair deal that prevents a strike, we are fully prepared for a work stoppage should one occur,\u201d according to a joint statement from Lightfoot and CPS Chief Executive Officer Janice K. Jackson.\n\nSchool bondholders and credit rating companies are monitoring the teachers\u2019 plans, and watching how much the nation\u2019s third-largest school district gives in to avoid or end a strike.\n\nBoth sides reaching an agreement before a walkout is within expectations, according to AllianceBernstein\u2019s Ceffalio. Chicago teachers last had a one-day walkout in April 2016, and in 2012, the union staged the city\u2019s first public school strike in 25 years.\n\n\u201cWe are paying close attention as bondholders,\u201d Ceffalio said.\n\nSince the district introduced its $7.7 billion budget in early August, its subsequent offers to the union would raise labor costs by tens of millions of dollars in fiscal 2020 and over the next five years, according to a person at the district close to the negotiations. The board still expects to stay in its budget parameters, according to the person who asked not to be named as the discussions are ongoing. Given additional state funding, the district \u201ccan more than afford to do better by our students,\u201d according to Chris Geovanis, a union spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for structural balance,\u201d Blake Yocom, an analyst for S&P Global Ratings, said in a phone interview. \u201cCPS has built in certain assumptions. Anything beyond that that reverses their positive trend or recent improvement in financial position would hold back any future upgrades.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the school district was in danger of running out of money. For example, in 2016, the district was facing a $1 billion deficit and needed to borrow money to stay solvent, the school system\u2019s management said at the time. Its finances have improved since the state of Illinois increased its funding to Chicago\u2019s schools last year. S&P in August raised its rating on the Chicago Board of Education to BB- from B+ with a positive outlook. Fitch also boosted its rating by one level to BB, two levels into junk.\n\n\u201cThey just returned to a positive fund balance,\u201d Yocom said. \u201cAny erosion of that could lead to a revision of the outlook back to stable. If this settlement is successful and achieves a structural balance, they were looking at a likelihood of an upgrade.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chicago teachers have decided to strike in about two weeks, leaving investors in the city\u2019s junk-rated school district closely watching the costs of the Chicago Board of Education\u2019s efforts to avoid a walkout.The Chicago Teachers Union said Wednesday it had set a strike date of Oct. 17", "authors": ["Shruti Date Singh"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OQy6bV6kEm97gwAfP01bSA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/92574e76f5f64d2cf17a0a0016e9140d", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
