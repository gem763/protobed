WEN -1.92% said it will bring back breakfast across its U.S. restaurants next year as fast-food chains compete to lure diners during more of the day.\n\nThe burger chain said Monday that it will spend $20 million to add more menu items and longer hours at its 5,813 domestic restaurants. Wendy\u2019s said it and its franchisees will hire some 20,000 workers to help roll out the expanded offerings.\n\nShares fell about 4% after hours to $21.01 when Wendy\u2019s said the investments had prompted it to adjust guidance for its current fiscal year. The company said it expects earnings per share adjusted for one-time items to decline between 3.5% and 6.5%, down from its previous forecast for growth of 3.5% to 7.0%. Earlier McDonald\u2019s Tests Robot Fryers and Voice-Activated Drive-Throughs (June 20)\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Makes Over All-Day Breakfast to Speed Up Wait Times (May 14) Breakfast has become an increasingly competitive part of the day for major fast-food companies. McDonald\u2019s Corp. has pointed to competition in breakfast as a key area of concern. Guest growth in breakfast is starting to recover for McDonald\u2019s after a slide, the company has said, but progress remains slow. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of new entrants into that space,\u201d McDonald\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said during a July call to discuss the company\u2019s most recent earnings report. Wendy\u2019s currently sells breakfast items at about 300 restaurants after earlier efforts to expand nationwide were scrapped. The company abandoned a 2012 push into breakfast at more of its restaurants after a year. Too eclectic a mix of healthy and indulgent options as well as competition from McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks Corp. were seen as problems at the time, analysts said. A Wendy\u2019s spokesperson said the company is confident in this launch. The new Wendy\u2019s morning menu features a bacon breakfast sandwich, a chicken biscuit and one of the chain\u2019s Frosty shakes made with coffee. Working those popular Wendy\u2019s items into breakfast foods will help the chain\u2019s menu stand out, Chief Executive Todd Penegor said on Monday.
