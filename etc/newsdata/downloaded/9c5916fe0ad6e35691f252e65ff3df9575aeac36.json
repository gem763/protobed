There are a number of important issues right now that could lead to the corrective action that the bears have been anticipating for so long but the potential for favorable outcomes exists as well. Market players need to stay focused on the clues provided by price action if they hope to navigate.\n\nThe market has caught many participants by surprise lately with major headlines about impeachment and rotational action that have not been well anticipated. The bears have been predicting market struggles due to slowing economic growth and incapable central banks but have missed the major driving forces lately. The likelihood of other surprises is high which makes it particularly important to manage positions carefully.\n\nThese are the six issues that the market must grapple with in the month ahead.\n\nChina Trade. China markets will be closed for a week long holiday so there is unlikely to be much additional news flow ahead of negotiations that are set to resume next week. There has been a steady diet of hopeful headlines but market players were caught by surprise on Friday when Bloomberg reported that the Trump Administration was considering ways to exclude China-based firms from U.S. Capital markets. That report was partial denied over the weekend but this is now an issue that is on the table and if negotiations breakdown next week, then this issue will be in play.\n\nMany market players believe it is highly unlikely that there will be a deal next week but the potential for some progress is what keeps the bears at bays. If there is a breakdown in negotiations and another round of tariff increases the reaction of the market is likely to be swift and ugly.\n\nRotational Action. The headline news has created problems for the market lately but it is the action under the surface that has created some major problems. It began a couple of weeks ago when there was a sudden shift out of high momentum software and cloud computing stocks and into value names. The rotation has persisted with other groups such as biotechnology and recent IPOs suffering the most.\n\nThis action is likely to do with positioning into the start of the fourth quarter and may slow down as we enter October, but it has created some major technical damage and has left the market with little leadership. Even precious metals have lost their luster as market players search for some new pockets of strength.\n\nEconomic slowing. Much of the recent bearish narrative has been focused on a slowing economy. There continue to be signs of problems but many market players and economists have not embraced this fear. Weaker economic news may tip the scale and create the justification for further liquidation of equities. The rotational action that is taking place is likely a function of the economic concerns that have been building\n\nCentral Banks. Dovish central banks have served the market well for a very long time but there are growing concerns that they are running out of ammunition and that further interest rate cuts will have limited impact. The Fed still has the potential to put a bid under the market but its potency has been declining. More interest rate hikes are on the horizon and if China trade negotiations don't advance they will be needed.\n\nThird Quarter Earnings. Third-quarter earnings season begins in the next couple of weeks and will help to develop the narrative about overall market health. There are obvious concerns about trade issues and market players will be keenly focused on forward guidance. Uncertainty is growing and if there are downward revisions in guidance it is going to be a problem\n\nImpeachment and other political issues. The market has not reacted too much to the impeachment drama so far as it is largely a continuation of the bitter political wars that have been ongoing since President Trump was elected. The potential of an impeachment vote adds some uncertainty and creates a negative environment but the main issue for the market is whether this drama interferes with trade negotiations and other economic issues. Congress will likely be consumed by these political issues and not accomplish much but will that impact the market?\n\nThe headwinds are strong but the market is aware of the issues and the dour sentiment shows that the problems have been discounted to some degrees. The bears have been wrong for so long that there is a tendency to dismiss them but the price action of individual stocks illustrate that there are some major issues that require a stout defense.\n\nI continue to hold very high levels of cash but I'm intrigued by some of the breakdowns that are taking place in IPOs and biotechnology. Not everything deserves the recent punishment but this is no time to put substantial capital at risk.", "description": "October has delivered the biggest crashes in history but some major market bottoms as well.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Market Participants Face Major Challenges As We Enter Treacherous October", "October Has Delivered The Biggest Crashes In History But Some Major Market Bottoms As Well.", "Timothy Collins", "Eric Jhonsa", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Bob Lang", "Chris Versace", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/7dd9c57a-a777-11e7-a15f-0b61a2f42911.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
