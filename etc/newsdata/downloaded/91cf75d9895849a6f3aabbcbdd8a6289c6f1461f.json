Both left the bank in 2016.\n\nLawyers for Citi, Deutsche and ANZ also said they want to cross-examine the ACCC\u2019s general manager of financial services competition, Leah Won, also named publicly as a witness for the first time. An ACCC spokeswoman declined to comment on Won\u2019s behalf.\n\nProsecution lawyers said they would respond to requests to allow their witnesses to be cross-examined when the matter returns to court on Sept. 27.\n\nAll the people and companies charged in the case have said they will plead not guilty, but no trial date has been set.", "description": "Two former senior executives of investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co in Australia were named on Wednesday as prosecution witnesses in a criminal cartel case by the state against rivals Citigroup and Deutsche Bank .", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
