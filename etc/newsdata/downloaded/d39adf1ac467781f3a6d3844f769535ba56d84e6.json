He has also refused to say whether he will resign.\n\nJohnson said on Tuesday that the Supreme Court ruling against him had hindered his attempt to get a Brexit deal but that as the law currently stood, the U.K. would leave the EU on Oct. 31.\n\n\"Obviously getting a deal is not made much easier against this background, but we are going to get on and do it,\" Johnson told reporters.\n\n\"I don't think that it's right, but we will go ahead, and of course Parliament will come back.\"\n\nWatch Johnson's reaction to the Supreme Court's decision:\n\nThe U.K. prime minister defended his prorogation of Parliament despite the country's top court ruling that it was unlawful. 0:56\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office said he won't resign as prime minister.\n\nHe's set to take a flight from New York overnight, earlier than planned, which would bring him back to London by the time Parliament resumes on Wednesday, according to his office.\n\nThe ruling followed three days of hearings last week before a panel of 11 judges.\n\nThe court rejected the government's assertions the decision to suspend Parliament until Oct. 14 was routine and not related to Brexit. It claimed that under Britain's unwritten constitution, it is a matter for politicians, not courts, to decide.\n\nThe government's opponents argue Johnson illegally shut down Parliament just weeks before the country is due to leave the 28-nation bloc for the \"improper purpose\" of dodging lawmakers' scrutiny of his Brexit plans.\n\nThey also accused Johnson of misleading the Queen, whose formal approval was needed to suspend the legislature.\n\nJohnson and Parliament have been at odds since he took power in July with the determination to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a divorce deal with Europe.\n\nCalls for Johnson's resignation\n\nThe landmark decision immediately prompted demands that Johnson quit.\n\nBritish Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn called on Johnson on Tuesday to consider his position and call a new election.\n\nWatch Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn demand Johnson's resignation:\n\nLabour Leader Jeremy Corbyn says U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson should resign after the Supreme Court ruled that his suspension of Parliament was illegal. 0:47\n\nTo huge cheers and chants of \"Johnson out!\" Corbyn said the prime minister should become the shortest-ever serving leader and Labour is ready to form a government.\n\n\"I invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to 'consider his position,'\" Corbyn told delegates at the Labour Party's annual conference in Brighton.\n\nScottish National Party lawmaker Joanna Cherry said Johnson should resign because of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nCherry is one of the people who brought the legal case against the prime minister.\n\n\"His position is untenable and he should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign,\" she said Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU Parliament's chief Brexit official Guy Verhofstadt says he is relieved that at least one key pillar of British life has survived: Parliamentary democracy.\n\nAt least one big relief in the Brexit saga: the rule of law in the UK is alive & kicking. Parliaments should never be silenced in a real democracy.<br><br>I never want to hear Boris Johnson or any other Brexiteer say again that the European Union is undemocratic. \u2014@guyverhofstadt\n\nTransparency campaigner Gina Miller called the ruling \"a win for parliamentary sovereignty, the separation of powers and independence of our British courts.\"\n\nMiller, one of the people who brought the case against the government, said Johnson advised the Queen to shut down Parliament \"to silence our democratically elected MPs at one of the most critical times in our country's modern history.\"", "description": "In a major blow to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the U.K.'s highest court has ruled his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks in the crucial countdown to the country's Brexit deadline is \"unlawful.\"", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5294989.1569321636!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/climate-change-un.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
