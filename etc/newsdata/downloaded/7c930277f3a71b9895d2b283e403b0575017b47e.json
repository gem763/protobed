I\u2019d never heard of it.\u201d Ms. Mercker said, First Coast News in Jacksonville, Florida, reported on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m an exercise fanatic, I eat right, but it just can knock on anybody\u2019s door.\u201d\n\nThe cancer had yet to spread to the rest of her body so she chose to try a vaccine being tested by the Mayo Clinic that could possibly rid her of the cancer cells.\n\nDr. Saranya Chumsri said the vaccine \u2014 which is administered just like a flu shot \u2014 is \u201csupposed to stimulate a patient\u2019s own immune response so that the immune cells like t-cells would go in and attack the cancer,\u201d and Ms. Mercker said the 12-week process worked.\n\n\u201cThey always took your blood, you had a physical, they\u2019d make your shot right there on the spot for you,\u201d Ms. Mercker said. \u201cIt was three shots, all in a row, alternating arms, four shots, two weeks apart.\u201d\n\nDr. Chumsri said Ms. Mercker still had to have a mastectomy to make sure \u201ceverything was removed properly,\u201d but it allowed researchers to study how the vaccine could affect the body.\n\nDr. Chumsri hopes this vaccine will help prevent cancer and said other trials have shown positive results, including those patients with Stage 4 cancer.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
