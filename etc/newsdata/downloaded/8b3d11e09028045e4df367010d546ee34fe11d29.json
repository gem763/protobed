New York location. All we know so far is that the confirmed date is 21 May 2020. But we're excited.\n\nFor those of you not up to date with your fashion terminology, a \u2018cruise collection\u2019 is a mid-season collection that falls between spring/summer and autumn/winter. Its name originally derives from the fact that wealthy customers would buy the clothes in advance of their holidays on cruise ships, although this is a little outdated now that cruise ships are largely associated with magic shows and OAPs. New York served as the backdrop for Gucci creative director Alessandro Michelle\u2019s first ever cruise collection for the brand, back in 2015, when the showcase took place at the city\u2019s Dia Art Foundation.\n\nThat said, the brash modernity of NYC is a bit of a departure from the iconic brand's last four Cruise selections, all of which have taken place in historic, even ancient settings. 2017 took place in the 13th century cloisters of Westminster Abbey (\u201cthe history [of London] is what's really cool\" Michelle said), while 2019\u2019s showcase went one step further into the past by taking place in a 4th century Roman Necropolis in Arles, France. Now it appears that Alessandro is taking a more future-facing approach.\n\nThis year\u2019s Gucci 2020 show, held in Rome, featured an internet-breaking duet between Harry Styles and Stevie Nicks, performing Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 'Landslide'. We can only guess what will top it in New York next year...\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Alessandro goes stateside!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1946f0c25ab0092b6c1cd/lede/1571919422450-1563222774003-GU636_FW19-CAMPAIGN_LAYOUTS_DPS_300dpi_44.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8676xh;0xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
