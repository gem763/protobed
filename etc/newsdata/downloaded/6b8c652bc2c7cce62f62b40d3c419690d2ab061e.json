The company will announce more autonomous cloud services next week at its OpenWorld conference.\n\n\"Autonomy is the defining attribute of a Generation 2 Cloud,\" Ellison said in a statement.\n\nOn Wednesday's conference call, Ellison elaborated, \"It's our goal to deliver the world's first and only completely autonomous cloud. You should have a bunch of autonomous services... so human beings aren't given the opportunity to make mistakes.\"\n\nOracle on Wednesday also announced its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 24 cents per share of outstanding common stock.", "description": "The CEO is leaving for health reasons, Oracle announced.
