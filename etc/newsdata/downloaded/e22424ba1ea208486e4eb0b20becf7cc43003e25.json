Mainly, it appears, through the conversion of convertible notes worth $4.5 million into ordinary shares on July 17, 2017. But by the end of FY19, Kingslane had shaved that stake to 36,757,534 shares \u2013 a decline of 5,420,004 shares, as detailed in this month's annual report.\n\nThese disposals would have, if sold on-market, netted anywhere between $7.3 million and $2.7 million, depending on the date.", "description": "Evan Cranston added another 100,000 shares to his tally in June.
