But knowing he lacked the pace to go clear of the cover, Slade produced a superbly weighted grubber kick regathered by Jonny May for the left wing's second try in three minutes.\n\nIt was a key play as, with Farrell adding the conversion, it meant England led 14-3 in the 23rd minute.\n\nFrom then on it was their match to lose and before the half was over, Slade showed his defensive skills with an important tackle on Kerevi.\n\nJones replaced Slade with Ford in the 61st minute as Farrell moved across to inside centre but by that stage the Exeter midfielder had more than played his part.", "description": "Forwards win games and backs decide by how many points runs the old rugby adage, and England's Henry Slade showed that on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7945/499d03641fc74db58c93fac733f0ec3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
