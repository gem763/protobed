These are inspired by a classic apple cider doughnut and, true to form, are dusted with cinnamon sugar. Apple cider that's been reduced and a bit of apple butter work in tandem to subtly flavor the fluffy cakes, and good old cream cheese frosting makes the ideal filling. For beautiful, uniformly sized cakes, use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to portion the batter for baking. If you don't have one, they might bake up a little wonky, but they\u2019ll still taste delightful.", "description": "Their name may be fun to say, but whoopie pies aren\u2019t really pies at all but rather soft, cakelike cookie sandwiches These are inspired by a classic apple cider doughnut and, true to form, are dusted with cinnamon sugar Apple cider that's been reduced and a bit of apple butter work in tandem to subtly flavor the fluffy cakes, and good old cream cheese frosting makes the ideal filling", "authors": ["Samantha Seneviratne", "Julia Moskin", "Melissa Clark", "Sam Sifton", "Tejal Rao"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/18/dining/ss-apple-cider-whoopie-pies-horizontal/ss-apple-cider-whoopie-pies-horizontal-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-18"}
