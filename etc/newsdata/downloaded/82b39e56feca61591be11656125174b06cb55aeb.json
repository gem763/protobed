I experienced that at Arsenal.\n\n\u2018We were 20 consecutive years in the top four but in the end it was not enough.\n\n\u2018Today, if you get in the Champions League people are very happy.\n\n\u2018That means that happens to Pochettino, once you\u2019re four or five years, somewhere, no matter how good a job you have done, you have to show people you can give more, and he\u2019s at that stage.\n\n\u2018They are a bit destabalised. When I played them two or three years ago they looked like a young, hungry team who had found good strength, good core of the team with people who were growing together, with people who expressed that hunger, and players from outside who were vital like Eriksen.\n\n\u2018Today you don\u2019t feel that exact same chemistry. A player like Eriksen is a bit sidelined because he doesn\u2019t look like he wants to commit to the future of the club.\n\n\u2018Modern life is down to small margins and at the moment the small margins are not in their favour.\n\nWenger says uncertainty over Christian Eriksen had impacted on Spurs\u2019 chemistry (Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Will they get that back? Because if you look at Tottenham in the Premier League they lost 13 games last year but they\u2019ve done extremely well in the Champions League and came close to winning it. It\u2019s down to small margins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Your real quality is always where you finish in the table. So the real trend is there.\n\n\u2018They knew and Pochettino knows, he said himself something is not there at the moment. And he will certainly rebuild that.\n\n\u2018The question we can ask today is it with Eriksen or without?\n\n\u2018I like him [Pochettino] very much because he\u2019s always been quiet, respectful, motivated, worked very well and got a lot of recognition from his own players, that means he\u2019s a quality manager.\u2019", "description": "Arsene Wenger has defended Mauricio Pochettino and suggests Arsenal have downgraded their ambitions since Unai Emery replaced him as manager.
