(Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images)\n\nRetired New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski revealed in a recent sit-down with CBS News that he had endured an alarming 20 concussions while playing in the NFL.\n\nThe topic came up when interviewer Reena Ninan asked him if he\u2019d let his son play football. Gronkowski answered by saying he would, but would make sure his son was educated about what he went through during his career in football, including the many, many injuries.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n.@RobGronkowski told CBSN's @reenaninan that he'd let his son play football \u2013\u2013only after educating him about what he went through in the game.\n\n\n\nHe said he had about \"nine surgeries, probably had 20 concussions\" playing football. https://t.co/CYw25maOgo pic.twitter.com/dltWn6Y4k2 \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cI would let my son play football, but first off I would educate him on the game. Educate him on what I went through. I truly believe any injury that you receive is fixable. I went through it. I had nine surgeries. Probably had like 20 concussions in my life, like no lie. I remember five, like blackout ones.\u201d\n\nAround 20 concussions, including five that caused him to lose consciousness. That\u2019s an overwhelming number. It\u2019s probably a good idea that Gronk stays retired, despite everyone asking him if he\u2019d ever return to the NFL.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like Gronk wants to come out of retirement, though. He told Ninan that he\u2019d really have to be ensorcelled to come back to the NFL, even if he could play a different position.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked if he'd return to the #NFL or change positions, @RobGronkowski says, \"I have to really be feeling it\" to come back https://t.co/CYw25maOgo pic.twitter.com/KYuvafiBji \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cA lot of people are like \u2018Are you gonna come back as a wide receiver?\u2019 I\u2019m thinking in my head I\u2019m gonna start telling people I\u2019m gonna be a safety or something... It\u2019s the same answer I have with everyone. I have to be really feeling it to come back. I\u2019m in a good place right now.\u201d\n\nGronk knows his own mind. And the best thing for him (and his brain) is to enjoy retirement and never look back.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Rob Gronkowski estimated that he had probably 20 concussions over his football career, including five that caused him to lose consciousness.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WYn615TE1YjzU_uKo5u8Ew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDMuNDY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nx1Gx4vOEXUDr_j..9rDvg--~B/aD0zNDkyO3c9NDk0NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1b3ce5d0-d595-11e9-bfd7-3e3e8d087acc", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
