Streaming launches from Apple, AT&T's WarnerMedia, NBC and HBO are also on the horizon, making for a crowded streaming space.\n\nBefore the announcement of Disney+, there were periods of time when Netflix's market cap was higher than Disney's. Now, Disney's market cap is double ($238 billion) Netflix's market value ($116 billion).\n\nFurther weighing on the stock, last month Netflix was hit by a rare loss in U.S. subscribers and a large miss on international subscriber adds in the second quarter, which sent the stock cratering, suffering its longest losing streak in five years.\n\n\"The signs-ups are going to start going down and this thing's controlled by the sign-ups,\" Cramer said of Netflix.\n\nCramer said if he owned Netflix's stock he would sell it. Shares of Netflix sunk 2.5% on Tuesday.\n\nNetflix isn't the only overvalued stock that Cramer is warning investors about.\n\nOn Monday, Cramer said investors need to be cautious as more and more stocks are being valued based on measures other than the revenue or earnings numbers. Cramer even likened the current market conditions to the dot-com bubble, when internet stocks rose and eventually collapsed, shedding nearly 80% of value within seven months in 2000.\n\n\"You have to be skeptical of markets, entire markets, where more and more stocks are valued on something other than earnings,\" said Cramer. \"The more stocks that trade on weird metrics, the more likely it is that the market's overvalued.\"\n\nDisclosure: NBC is part of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC.", "description": "The once-beloved Netflix is now negative for the year as investors start to question some of the high-flying leaders of this bull market.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105561990-1541682651446gettyimages-1020621862.jpeg?v=1569337712", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
