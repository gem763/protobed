Yet, in fact, he managed to stay in power largely thanks to the complicated Canadian electoral system \u2026 and a lack of competition.\n\n\u201cYou have sent us back to Ottawa, you have given us a clear mandate,\u201d Justin Trudeau told a crowd at his campaign headquarters in Montreal, Quebec.These aren't the words of a man who recognizes that voters stripped him of a majority, including a net loss of 30 seats in his home province.\n\nJudging from the mood and words at Trudeau's \u2018victory\u2019 party, one could be forgiven for not knowing that his Liberals lost over 1 million votes compared to 2015, or that their share of the popular vote around the country plummeted by over 6 points.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trudeau\u2019s Liberal Party set to cling to power after tight general elections\n\nIt would be nearly impossible to know you were celebrating the win for the party that actually got the second largest number of votes!The numbers obviously tell a different story, in addition to numerous other indications from election night that show Canadians are not happy with JT.\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould, Trudeau's former attorney general who quit Trudeau's cabinet due to their attempts to interfere with her office\u2019s investigation into a criminal case against Quebec-based construction company, SNC-Lavalin, ran and won as an independent. She left the Liberals in protest, and was rewarded by the electorate for her move.\n\nThe reasons behind the disenchantment with the image-obsessed Trudeau are many, well documented and often discussed. Pundits from all political stripes on election night acknowledged that Trudeau's appeal had \u201clost its luster,\u201d but in spite of this, he will be returning to 24 Sussex Drive to serve a second term as Canada's prime minister.\n\nSo how is it that Canadians can be simultaneously pissed off at someone, and vote them back in? In short, the Liberals didn't exactly get voted back in.\n\nIn Canada's flawed electoral system, the Liberals won 33 percent of votes, but 46 percent of the seats. The Conservatives won 34.5 percent of the popular vote, but 37 percent of the seats and the center-left NDP, obtained just 7 percent of seats with 16 percent of votes.\n\nAlso on rt.com Losing majority with hysterical dignity? Trudeau\u2019s \u2018victory speech\u2019 turns into scandal, as he jumps on stage interrupting rival\n\nSuch figures, which might look confusing, are indeed a result of the Canadian electoral system dubbed \u2018first past the post\u2019. The country is divided into one-candidate constituencies known as ridings. A candidate with the highest number of votes in a riding gets a seat in parliament \u2013 and they do not even need to gain an absolute majority of votes (more than 50 percent).\n\nBack in 2015 Trudeau said he would do away with the \u2018first past the post\u2019 system, but reneged on his pledge, precisely because it disportionately reinforces the Liberals position atop Canada's political landscape.Beyond the limits this system already puts up for people seeking alternatives to the ruling party, the other options also failed to inspire.\n\nSure, NDP had a good, left-populist program and a strong social media presence, especially in the later part of the campaign. However, most activists I spoke with before the election were pretty unmotivated given the party spent much of the year on the sidelines.\n\nOn the right, the Conservatives under Andrew Scheer weren't able to capitalize on a weakened and scandal-marred government in large part because much of the country doesn't want either the austerity or the sort of social policies that some conservatives push.\n\nThis played into the Liberals tried and true election fail-safe \u2013 calling for \u2018strategic voting\u2019.It works like this: Liberal activists and politicians drum up fears about the impact of Conservative policies to scare non-rightwing voters.\n\nAlso on rt.com The end of Trudeaumania: Canadians are over PM's image obsession, lack of substance & broken promises\n\n\u2018Anything But Conservative\u2019 is then presented as a pragmatic way to ensure that a Tory government does not get elected. The votes of those swayed by the ABC mantra defaults Liberals as the most \u2018viable\u2019 option to achieve the objection of keeping out the Conservatives, in spite of the Liberals own track record or policies.\n\nFor years and at various levels of government, the Liberal Party has insidiously but successfully invoked \u2018lesser-evilism\u2019 to their benefit, and it certainly helped push the Liberals ahead in a number of key areas.\n\nThe numbers of those who couldn't be bothered to vote \u2013 due to apathy or no appealing option \u2013 also increased considerably.\n\nSo no, Justin Trudeau did not win these elections. He did not regain the trust of the voters, nor did he shed the baggage he has accumulated over the last few years.\n\nHe lost just enough to keep his job by playing the system and his opponents in spite of the obvious dissatisfaction of the populace, many of whom held their nose while they cast a ballot for him.\n\nBy Pablo Vivanco\n\nPablo Vivanco is a journalist and analyst specializing in politics and history in the Americas, and served as the Director of teleSUR English.
