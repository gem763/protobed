It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.\"\n\nIt said strongly encrypted platforms are used by pedophile rings, drug traffickers and terrorists and that NSO's technologies \"provide proportionate, lawful solutions.\"\n\nFacebook demands in the suit that NSO Group be denied access to Facebook's services and systems and seeks unspecified damages.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCathart said leaders of tech firms \"should join U.N. (free speech) Special Rapporteur David Kaye's call for an immediate moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of dangerous spyware.\"\n\n\"This is huge. I am really glad to see a tech company put their massive litigation team on the field on behalf of users,\" tweeted Alex Stamos, a Stanford University researcher and former Facebook chief security officer.\n\nWhatsApp is the world's most popular communications software, with about 1.5 billion users in 180 countries.\n\nWHATSAPP AIMS TO INCLUDE SELF-DESTRUCTING MESSAGES IN GROUP CHATS\n\nJohn Scott-Railton, a researcher with the internet watchdog Citizen Lab, called the hack \"a very scary vulnerability\" when it was discovered. \"There's nothing a user could have done here, short of not having the app.\"\n\nCitizen Lab subsequently volunteered to assist Facebook in the investigation.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that malicious code from NSO was sent from April 29 through May 10 over WhatsApp servers. The aim was to infect some 1,400 devices whose users included attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, diplomats and other government officials. It said the targeted phone numbers were in countries including Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Mexico.\n\nFACEBOOK EMPLOYEES SIGN LETTER OPPOSING POLITICAL ADS POLICY\n\nNSO's spyware has repeatedly been found deployed to target such people. Most notably, the spyware was implicated in the gruesome killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year and whose body has never been found.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Facebook alleges that after it publicly announced that it had identified and closed the vulnerability an NSO employee complained \"You just closed our biggest remote for celluar .... It's on the news all over the world.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe spyware did not directly affect the end-to-end encryption that makes WhatsApp chats and calls private. It merely used a bug in the WhatsApp software as an infection vehicle.\n\nNSO Group's flagship malware, called Pegasus, allows spies to effectively take control of a phone \u2014 remotely and surreptitiously controlling its cameras and microphones from remote servers and vacuuming up personal and geolocation data.\n\nA European private equity firm, Novalpina Capital LLP, bought a majority stake in NSO Group in February. It claimed in a May statement that \"highly targeted interception technologies\" of the kind NSO Group produces \"play a critical role in protecting the public\" and can do so without undermining privacy rights or free speech.", "description": "Facebook sued the Israeli hacker-for-hire company NSO Group on Tuesday in U.S. federal court for allegedly targeting some 1,400 users of its encrypted messaging service WhatsApp with highly sophisticated spyware.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/03/0/0/whatsapp.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
