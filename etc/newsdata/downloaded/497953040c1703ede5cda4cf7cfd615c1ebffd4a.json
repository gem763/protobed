'We've been looking at players and we were close to a couple but it's not right if you don't get the right players. The money is there to strengthen in January and in the summer.\n\n'We're planning and we're looking. We're refining our targets, but just before the summer transfer window ended, the ready-made players weren't there. But the resources are there if the right players are available.\n\n'January is a difficult window, anyway. But if there are players available and at the right price, I'm sure we will spend. There might be some experienced players who can come in and help the younger players - that might be worth the money.\n\nManchester United have failed to win their last five games including defeat at Newcastle\n\nSolskjaer's side sit 12th in the Premier League following their worst Premier League start\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\n'So it depends on who is available. I'm not going to go down the route of bringing players in on big contracts and big fees if they're not the right ones for the whole group and for the future.'\n\nIn contrast to Liverpool, United have endured their worst start ever to a Premier League season and already face a tough battle to break back into the top four this term sitting 12th in the table and five points off a Champions League spot.\n\nYet despite admitting his squad's shortcomings the former United striker is confident his side have what it takes to lead a revival and break into the top four.\n\n'Yes, definitely,' he told Neville. 'Of course, we're looking at one or two new signings. We're one or two players light, and we've said that, but if the right ones are available in January then we might do something. If not, these players will give everything.'\n\nJuventus striker Mario Mandzukic is one of Manchester United's transfer targets in January\n\nAlthough Solskjaer is looking ahead to possible January recruitments, long term United want six players over the next two transfer windows.\n\nSportsmail understands club chiefs have targeted two strikers, two central midfielders, a central defender and a left back in an ambitious revamp.\n\nJuventus veteran Mario Mandzukic and Moussa Dembele at Lyon are of interest, as are Atletico Madrid's Saul Niguez and Leicester City's James Maddison.\n\nUnited's poor start has piled the pressure on the Norwegian and his position as manager is under scrutiny with Massimiliano Allegri waiting in the wings to take over according to Italian reports.\n\nBut Solskjaer has shrugged off concerns over his position in the club, insisting he has a long term plan for the next few seasons which have been backed by chief executive Ed Woodward.\n\nSolskjaer claims he has the backing of the United board including Ed Woodward\n\nMAN UTD FORM Sep 22: West Ham (A) lost 0-2 Sep 25: Rochdale (H) drew 1-1 (won 5-3 on pens) Sep 30: Arsenal (H) drew 1-1 Oct 3: Alkmaar (A) drew 0-0 Oct 6: Newcastle (A) lost 0-1\n\n'All the talks I've had with the owners, with Ed Woodward and the club have been about me having a three-year contract,' said Solskjaer.\n\n'We're planning long-term. I've been given the job and if you lose a game or two, you don't wait for a call to be given assurances.\n\n'But we started out with a plan and a recruitment plan is in place. I'm 100 per cent sure from my time here that the structure is right because it is always the manager who has the final say.'\n\nSolskjaer started a clearout process in the summer which saw talented players including Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku depart who were initially big-name arrivals tasked with firing United back into a title fight.\n\nAlexis Sanchez (left) and Romelu Lukaku were shipped out to Inter Milan in the summer\n\nUnited have since failed to kick on without them and Solskjaer claimed that although he does not doubt their ability, hinted that both among other departures during his tenure were not committed to giving 100 per cent for the team.\n\n'In one-off games, you think we could've had a number of extra players with experience,' he added. 'Alexis and Rom are goalscorers and good players, but at the moment, we made those decisions and they were the right decisions.\n\n'That's the only way you've got to look at it. All the players here want to give everything for the club and for the shirt - that's a big thing.\n\n'Every day that they come in training, and every day that they put the shirt on, they're going to give everything that they have. So you can't really say, 'oh I wish I didn't do that'.", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claims that his Manchester United side are short of players but admits he still might not add to his his struggling squad in January.", "authors": ["Dan Ripley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/08/19825480-0-image-a-13_1571298556073.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
