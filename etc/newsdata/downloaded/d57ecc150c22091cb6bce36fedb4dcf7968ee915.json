Aside from these changes, it\u2019s a fairly minor update for Apple Watch owners that were already running watchOS 6, but it includes the usual performance improvements and bug fixes that you\u2019d expect from a point release.\n\nApple hasn\u2019t revealed whether this update improves battery life on the latest Series 5 Apple Watch. Some owners have reported issues with the battery life not lasting a full day, and beta copies of watchOS 6.1 appeared to improve things for some. Either way, watchOS 6.1 is available right now from the General > Software Update section of the Watch app on iOS.", "description": "Apple is releasing watchOS 6.1 for Apple Watch devices today.
