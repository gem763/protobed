The Nasdaq Composite finished at 8,148.71 after gaining 100.06 points, or 1.2%.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nU.S. retail sales fell in September (link) for the first time in seven months raising concerns that the slowdown in business spending evident in the manufacturing sector, resulting from President Trump's international trade policies, may be spilling over into consumer spending.\n\n\"Consumption is poised to cool along with slower job gains ahead, and the Fed will be looking closely for any signs of trade uncertainty contaminating the most important segment of the U.S. economy,\" said economist Katherine Judge of CIBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe probability of an October interest rate cut (link) by the Federal Reserve rose to 90% on Wednesday after the retail sales data was published, up from (link)78% on Tuesday.\n\nThe IMF warned (link) on Wednesday that the U.S. stock market was overvalued as belief in a Federal Reserve rescue for the economy is allowing investors to ignore tensions over international trade policy.\n\nEarlier, China threatened to retaliate (link) over a series of bills backing pro-democracy protesters (link)in Hong Kong that unanimously passed the House of Representatives late Tuesday.\n\n\"We think it's possible this bill will push China into a public show of defiance against U.S. 'interference,'\" which could mean a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note. \"Under that scenario, markets would be relieved if China's retaliation kept the trade pact intact. However, higher political uncertainty in Hong Kong would be a sizable downside risk,\" Lawler said.\n\nSee:China vows 'strong countermeasures' in wake of U.S. bill supporting Hong Kong protesters (link)\n\n(link)The Wall Street Journal also reported (link) there are questions about the amount of U.S. agricultural products China will actually buy as part of the tentative trade deal announced last week. At a meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said he would likely not sign any trade deal until mid-November.\n\nMeanwhile, the third quarter U.S. corporate earnings reporting season got off to a good start this week.
