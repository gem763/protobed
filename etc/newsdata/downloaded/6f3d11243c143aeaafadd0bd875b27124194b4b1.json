I miss him. I fear for him. And I desperately want him back home where he belongs and where he can be himself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It has turned my life upside down. It\u2019s something that happens in a film. I keep waking up and wishing it was just a bad dream. It is better for me to think he is having an adventure and is enjoying it. It is heart-wrenching and I feel helpless.\u2019\n\nWaveney MP Peter Aldous who represents Lowestoft has confirmed he is liaising with the Foreign Office and has written to foreign secretary Dominic Raab to seek assistance in bringing Myles back to the UK.\n\nMr Kettlewell said he and his former partner split up in 2013, and were granted joint custody of their son with 50:50 access in September last year.\n\nHis partner who he is not naming had a job and a home in the Lowestoft area, so that Myles could split his time between them.\n\nMr Kettlewell said that courts granted him permission to be the keeper of his son\u2019s two passports to reduce the risk of him being abducted to his mother\u2019s homeland.\n\nHe claimed that the courts rejected an application by his former partner in June for her to be able to take Myles to live permanently in Russia with her.\n\nHe said that Myles\u2019 mother returned to court in July to request permission to take him on holiday to Russia. (Picture: @BringMylesHome)\n\nMr Kettlewell said: \u2018The courts decided that it was in Myles\u2019 best interest to remain in the UK with his loving family and the comfort and security his homeland provides. \u2018\n\nHe said that Myles\u2019 mother returned to court in July to request permission to take him on holiday to Russia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Kettlewell said: \u2018Despite raising my natural concern regarding his safety, I was given little choice by the court but to agree to this. She therefore took Myles on holiday, and returned, albeit a day later than what had been agreed.\n\n\u2018Since returning to the UK, she retained Myles\u2019 passport and refused to hand it back to me. Once more, I had no choice but to apply to the court for an enforcement order to guarantee the safe return of his passport to me.\u2019\n\nHe said they were due to go back to court on October 3 to allow him to seek an order, forcing her to return the passport.\n\nMr Kettlewell said he dropped off his son at his school as normal on September 30 and later called to arrange a meeting with a staff member and his former partner to deliver court paperwork regarding the passport handover.\n\nBut he was then told that she had taken Myles out of the school just before 1pm.\n\nMr Kettlewell feared immediately that she was planning to take him to Russia and dialled 999 at 3.45pm to report the \u2018potential abduction\u2019.\n\nMr Kettlewell said he was worried that his son\u2019s autism would make it particularly difficult for him being forced to start a new life in Russia (Picture: @BringMylesHome)\n\nHe requested that a \u2018crucial block\u2019 be put on Myles\u2019 passport, but the passport was not blocked until 9.30pm which was too late to stop him from joining his mother on a 10.45pm flight to Russia that night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Kettlewell said he was worried that his son\u2019s autism would make it particularly difficult for him being forced to start a new life in Russia.\n\nHe said: \u2018One of the greatest things you can feel when growing up is safe and secure-nothing to worry about, loved and content.\n\n\u2018This is true for all children, but especially true for those children with additional needs. Myles was diagnosed in 2017 with autism and is lucky to be in a mainstream school that supports his educational and additional needs brilliantly well.\n\n\u2018A child with autism\u2019s general well-being relies on structure, familiarity and routine. For Myles, stability is quite simply all about being at home where he is able to enjoy the simplest of pleasures: sharing his love of \u2018space and exploration\u2019 with me or enjoying the comfort of watching the birds in the garden.\n\n\u2018Comfort for Myles is certainly not about flying to an unfamiliar country and being dumped in a land of strangers where he is unable to speak the language.\u2019\n\nMr Kettlewell has now launched a campaign to raise funds to help pay the legal costs of bringing his son home, as he is unable to get Legal Aid. The campaign with a \u00a350,000 target had already had donations of nearly \u00a39,000 from well-wishers.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
