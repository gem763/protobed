(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nSometime this season, Redskins rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins figures to make his NFL debut, but barring injury, that moment won\u2019t come Sunday opposite Giants rookie quarterback Daniel Jones.\n\n\u201cI know everybody wants to say, \u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 and, \u2018The season\u2019s over; go ahead and play Haskins.\u2019 But we feel confident we can turn this thing around,\u201d Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said during a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.\n\nGruden\u2019s comments came one day after veteran starter Case Keenum committed five turnovers in an ugly, 31-15 home loss to the Bears that dropped Washington to 0-3.\n\nNBC Sports\u2019s Peter King, for one, doesn\u2019t understand what the heck Gruden and the Redskins are waiting for.\n\n[Jay Gruden doesn't think Redskins' season is over, so Dwayne Haskins will continue to wait]\n\n\u201cWhat is this franchise doing?\u201d King asked co-hosts Mike Florio and Chris Simms on \u201cPro Football Talk Live.\u201d \u201d \u2026 How possibly, with such a depressing, gut-crunching, awful performance on Monday night, do you say to your fan base, \u2018Yep, we\u2019re going up to the Giants and it\u2019s a battle of bad teams in the NFC East and we\u2019re going to [start] Case Keenum\u2019? Boy, I tell you what, that\u2019s going to inspire confidence in your fan base.\"\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very close to Dwayne Haskins\u2019s time,\u201d Simms replied. \u201cHe is raw. We saw that in the preseason. Leading into [Monday] night, Case Keenum had played good football. He had given them opportunities. He had five touchdowns, zero interceptions the first two weeks. [Monday] night was a disaster, there\u2019s no doubt. He threw some dumb interceptions, he had some bad pocket presence.\"\n\nGruden has suggested that Haskins, who only started one season at Ohio State, isn\u2019t ready to lead an NFL offense.\n\n\u201cIf we feel like Dwayne gives us the best chance to win in a coming game, we\u2019ll definitely put Dwayne out there,\u201d Gruden said Tuesday. \u201cIf we feel like it\u2019s Colt [McCoy], when he gets healthy, it could be Colt. But right now we feel like it\u2019s Case Keenum, and we\u2019re going to move forward with him this week.\u201d\n\nOn ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up,\u201d former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky said he would turn to the rookie if he were Gruden, despite Haskins\u2019s lack of experience.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s probably against a lot of the things I believe in when it [comes to] grooming a young quarterback, but the fact that Terry McLaurin is playing so well at wide receiver is encouraging to me, and at some point I\u2019ve gotta see if Dwayne Haskins can be my version of, I guess Daniel Jones.\"\n\nJones, the No. 6 overall pick in this year\u2019s draft, made his first start for the Giants on Sunday in place of veteran Eli Manning. The rookie, who started for three years at Duke, threw for 336 yards and two touchdowns, and he also ran for two scores in a 32-31 win.\n\nNate Burleson pointed to Jones\u2019s early success, as well as that of other quarterbacks thrust into action as rookies, such as Deshaun Watson and Baker Mayfield, as one reason for a possible switch. There\u2019s another factor, though.\n\n[After third lackluster loss, Redskins' defense has few answers for how to fix things]\n\n\u201cIf you want a buzz in Washington, then go ahead and put Dwayne Haskins in,\u201d Burleson said on NFL Network\u2019s \u201cGood Morning Football.\u201d \u201cI love me some Case Keenum, but if you want to get some excitement, if you want your team to rally around something new, a new feeling, a new energy, go ahead and put Dwayne Haskins in right now.\u201d\n\nBurleson\u2019s co-host, Peter Schrager, agreed that a change might be needed to keep the Redskins relevant in a season that\u2019s already in danger of going off the rails.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of not talking about the Redskins again until the next draft,\u201d Schrager said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s beyond who gives you the best chance to move the sticks, drive to drive, and it\u2019s who can light up a fan base. I look at the Giants\u2019 situation last week. They ripped the Band-Aid off, they said Daniel Jones, maybe the plan wasn\u2019t to go to you right away, but they did and now the Giants have their fan base electrified. \u2026 Maybe you just need a change, and it\u2019s nothing against Case Keenum.\u201d\n\nGiven Washington\u2019s deficiencies at other positions, former Redskins running back Clinton Portis suggested that it would be best for Haskins to remain on the bench. \u201cThere\u2019s no real upside to putting him in,\u201d Portis tweeted. \u201cDon\u2019t get him mixed up in this explosion.\u201d\n\nWe need to protect Haskins from himself. He\u2019s going to come on thinking he can do this.. but when you look at the roster and our positioning, there\u2019s no real upside to putting him in. Don\u2019t get him mixed up in this explosion. \u2014 Clinton Portis (@TheRealC_Portis) September 25, 2019\n\nIf there\u2019s an explosion, I don\u2019t want Haskins in it. If he doesn\u2019t deliver wins, no matter what his play is, the conversation is \u201clet\u2019s draft Tu\u2019a.\u201d Dont be in that conversation. The first two weeks I don\u2019t put on Case. We gave Case praise but it didn\u2019t matter since he didn\u2019t win \u2014 Clinton Portis (@TheRealC_Portis) September 25, 2019\n\nOn Fox Sports\u2019s \u201cFirst Things First,\u201d Cris Carter said it\u2019s too early for the Redskins to make a change and raised questions about the offensive line\u2019s ability to protect the rookie. \u201cGood Morning Football\u2019s\u201d Kyle Brandt said if Gruden does decide to make a switch, he should wait until Washington\u2019s trip to Miami in Week 6. The similarly hapless Dolphins, Brandt said, would provide a \u201ca soft landing\u201d for Haskins. ESPN draft expert Mel Kiper agrees.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do it against the Giants with Daniel Jones,\u201d Kiper said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t want that. Maybe three weeks down the road when you get the right opponent, if Keenum isn\u2019t playing great. If the Redskins are losing, then all of a sudden you make that change. I think the right spot is three weeks down the road.\u201d\n\nLocally, The Team 980 host Kevin Sheehan lobbied \u2014 again \u2014 for more than a quarterback change.\n\n\u201cI wanted the reboot in January,\u201d Sheehan said Tuesday. \u201cWhy not start it now? First of all, trade Trent Williams today, please, Bruce [Allen]. Trade Ryan Kerrigan if you can get something significant for him. Start Dwayne Haskins Sunday at the Meadowlands. How much worse could Dwayne Haskins be than Case Keenum was [Monday] night?\"\n\nSheehan would get rid of Gruden and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky, too, along with team president Bruce Allen.\n\n[NFL Power Rankings: Redskins slip to 29th after falling to 0-3]\n\nKing also criticized the Redskins for their handling of the Williams situation, refusing to trade their Pro Bowl left tackle because they were confident he would return. There\u2019s no end in sight for Williams\u2019s holdout.\n\n\u201cThey look like fools,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s an utterly preposterous way to run your organization. And now you\u2019ve got your first-round pick that you take and he\u2019s not playing because, for some reason, at 0-3, you want to stand behind Case Keenum and his five-turnover performance? This is a moribund franchise, and I don\u2019t know how those fans can be anything but sort of destitute right now.\"\n\nKing summed up the Redskins\u2019 situation succinctly: \u201cThis is a franchise that is totally messed up right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re only three games into the season and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any franchise in the NFL that can be less optimistic right now than Washington is.\u201d\n\nWould starting Haskins change that?\n\nRead more on the Redskins:\n\nJosh Norman is being picked on by opponents, and it\u2019s hurting the Redskins\n\nRedskins can\u2019t spell, stir correctly or win in another Monday night debacle\n\nAt 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 loss to the Bears", "description": "Jay Gruden is sticking with Case Keenum for now, but pundits suggest the rookie could bring some energy to the franchise.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
