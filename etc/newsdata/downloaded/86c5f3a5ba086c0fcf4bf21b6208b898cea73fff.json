Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. There is already a bobblehead of AOC from another company.\n\nSandy from the Bronx is a 30-year-old freshman member of the House of Representatives. A mere nine months into her life as an elected official, she is headed to becoming a legend. At least that is the claim from FCTRY, a company that creates action figures \u201cinspired by big political names\u201d. A Kickstarter campaign has begun to finance the venture.\n\nIf the campaign launching Tuesday is successful, the scaled-down AOC will stand six inches tall and about an inch wide. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s smiling, pint-sized doppelg\u00e4nger sports a white suit similar to the one the House freshman wore to her swearing-in ceremony in January. She\u2019s also seen with her \u201csignature red lip,\u201d gold hoop earrings and pulled-back hair. \u201cAOC\u2019s bendable arms are ready to knock down the house,\u201d FCTRY tells ITK.\n\n\u201cKnock down the house\u201d is a reference to the name of the documentary filmed of AOC\u2019s campaign. It was shown at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Festival Favorite Award. The documentary is now a nominee for a Critic\u2019s Choice Documentary Award.\n\nThe documentary Knock Down the House, which included the story of Ocasio-Cortez and her successful congressional campaign, was nominated for the \u201cMost Compelling Living Subject of a Documentary.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez is included in the nomination, along with Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, and Paula Jean Swearengin, who all ran for office also but lost. She would be \u201chonored at the event\u201d if the film wins. Knock Down the House was also nominated for \u201cBest Documentary\u201d and \u201cBest Political Documentary.\u201d\n\nThe CEO of FCTRY says \u201cAOC is the face of the future.\u201d The company has a long line of action figures honoring liberal politicians and public figures. If, as a conservative, you\u2019ve never heard of the company, it is understandable. You are not included in their target market.\n\nThe 30-year-old lawmaker \u201cwent from bartending and waiting tables to becoming one of the most influential politicians of our time, all in the span of three years,\u201d FCTRY CEO Jason Feinberg said in a statement. \u201cAdding her to our collection of political action figures was a no-brainer. AOC is the face of the future.\u201d FCTRY unveiled its figure of Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) in January. The company also debuted in January a $20 Robert Mueller mini-me, based on the former special counsel who investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Brooklyn-based manufacturer raised more than $600,000 on Kickstarter to fund a \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d figure, inspired by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, last year. In 2017, the company said it would donate all profits from its \u201cTrump Over Re-Action Figure,\u201d based on the president, to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAs you can see, hardly a conservative-friendly doll, er, action figure manufacturer.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign page has a timeline of AOC\u2019s life noting all of her accomplishments. It always makes me cringe when I am reminded that she graduated from Boston University with a double major in Economics and International Relations. Her dream of a socialist America living under the thumb of her Green New Deal or abiding by her anti-semitism in foreign policy is enough to give any conservative scream into a pillow.\n\nI\u2019ll end this with a tidbit from the article announcing AOC\u2019s documentary Critic\u2019s Choice nomination \u2013 American Factory is up for four awards. If the name sounds familiar, it is because the documentary is the first big splash coming from Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s Netflix deal. Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s former ambassador to the United Nations, is on the board of directors of Netflix. A documentary on the presidential campaign of Pete Buttigieg is also now in the works.", "description": "The hype.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AOC-pointing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
