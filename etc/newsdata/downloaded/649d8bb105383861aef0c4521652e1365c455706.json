The state has banned the harvesting of crops and sale of all produce of animal origin from a wide area in the region as a precaution while awaiting tests. Some farmers have been forced to dump tens of thousands of litres of milk in the past few days.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, walks past firefighters at the Lubrizol chemical factory in Rouen.
