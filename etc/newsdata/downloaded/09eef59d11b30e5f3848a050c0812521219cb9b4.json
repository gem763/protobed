The answer to that, at least for now, is as variable as the weather.\n\nThe destructive typhoon that was hitting Japan\u2019s main island while Ireland was beating Samoa down south in Fukuoka forced Saturday\u2019s two other games to be canceled, and cast serious doubt over the chances of Japan and Scotland getting to play in Yokohama on Sunday. That decision will wait until morning.\n\nIreland\u2019s bonus-point win, achieved despite being a player down for more than half the game, means Scotland has to beat Japan to have any chance of advancing.\n\nIreland moved atop Pool A with 16 points, two more than Japan and six clear of Scotland. Canceled games are logged as 0-0 ties and both teams are awarded two competition points, enough for Japan to qualify for the knockout stage for the first time.\n\nThere were plenty of permutations heading into the last weekend of the group stage, so Ireland needed to ensure it controlled its own quarterfinal destiny. The bonus point was wrapped up before halftime, with flyhalf Johnny Sexton crossing for two tries.\n\n\u201cI really liked the start. I think we\u2019ve started really well in all four games and haven\u2019t continued it,\u201d Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt said. \u201cToday we did,\u201d\n\nBut they had to play more than 50 minutes with 14 men after center Bundee Aki became the first Ireland player sent off at a World Cup.\n\n\u201cTactically we were relatively solid when we lost Bundee,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThe forwards muscled up well and had to work hard.\u201d\n\nAki, who is of Samoan descent, was red carded in the 29th minute for a dangerous high tackle on Ulupano Seuteni, leading with his shoulder in the flyhalf\u2019s face.\n\nBoth head coaches considered it a fair tackle from Bundee, who risks being ruled out of the quarterfinals under World Rugby\u2019s crackdown on high tackles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all split-second stuff. We\u2019ll see what the judiciary decide. But once it\u2019s a red card you sense a loss of control over what happens next, no matter what you present,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI certainly feel for Bundee, he\u2019s pretty devastated that any further participation is potentially at risk.\u201d\n\nSamoa\u2019s head coach Steve Jackson threw his weight behind Bundee getting reprieved.\n\n\u201cI hope no further sanction comes to him. People don\u2019t go out there to make head contact,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThere are more concussions that come from tackles around the knee, and people who get kneed in the head. Was their malice? No. He only had two or three meters to make a decision.\u201d\n\nIt took the tournament tally for reds to a record-extending seven.\n\nBut it made little difference to the contest, such was Ireland\u2019s domination in the forwards allied to the quick-thinking of Sexton and his halves partner Conor Murray.\n\nThe score was 21-5 when Aki was sent off - Ireland\u2019s tries coming from hooker Rory Best, prop Tadhg Furlong and Sexton - and 26 unanswered points followed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to keep your composure. We felt we were in a good rhythm before the red card and you have to increase your intensity,\u201d Best said.\n\nSexton got his second try of the game right on the halftime buzzer, fed quickly by Murray on the blind side from a close-range scrum.\n\nSexton then converted fullback Jordan Larmour\u2019s early into the second half after Murray\u2019s smart miss-out pass fooled Samoa\u2019s ragged defense.\n\nNo. 8 CJ Stander and replacement winger Andrew Conway added further tries.\n\nBackrower Jack Lam scored Samoa\u2019s only try, although both teams had a second-half try ruled out by TMO.\n\nBest got the first try in the fourth minute from a driving maul. It was awarded after one of several video reviews.\n\nTMO was used again moments later to sin-bin hooker Seilala Lam for planting his shoulder into left winger Jacob Stockdale\u2019s face as both player crouched.\n\nIreland punished that sloppy mistake with a converted try in the eighth. Furlong broke four tackles, even going through one with an almost ballet-like pirouette that is most irregular for a player of his imposing size.\n\nThen Sexton swapped passes neatly with Larmour and sprinted over the line before converting his try for 21-0.\n\nSamoa reduced the deficit when Lam burrowed over from close range.\n\nThen, Aki clobbered Seuteni, sending him down to the ground and rocking back on his knees. It was a heavy hit, and Seuteni needed treatment on the field before going off.\n\nIreland upped its urgency, and was helped by a yellow card for Samoa flanker TJ Ioane.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty poor discipline from us,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWe gave away too many penalties.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A seven-try, 47-5 win over Samoa secured Ireland's place in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals, removing any doubt about its progression to the knockout stages.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
