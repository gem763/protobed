Community College before transferring to Southern Illinois for his final two seasons of eligibility. He eclipsed 12 points per game in both seasons and added 5.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks last fall.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWarriors sign free agent center Kavion Pippen pic.twitter.com/wooRR2223p \u2014 Warriors PR (@WarriorsPR) October 7, 2019\n\nPippen\u2019s deal is non-guaranteed, but he could have an outside shot to crack the team on a two-way contract if injuries persist. The Warriors have only one player \u2014 Willie Cauley-Stein \u2014 on their roster who is taller than him.\n\nSigning Pippen became necessary since Cauley-Stein remains sidelined with a left foot injury and will miss all of training camp, if not the start of the regular season. Meanwhile, Kevon Looney has been banged up all summer and is now out with a hamstring injury, while second-rounder Alen Smailagic is out for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d with an ankle injury.\n\nPippen had to beat out another famous name to make the Warriors training camp. Just days earlier, the team hosted former No. 2 overall draft pick Hasheem Thabeet for a workout, but they reportedly wanted a big man with more range.\n\nThe Warriors have four more preseason games before their regular-season slate kicks off on Oct. 24 at the brand new Chase Center against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nThe Warriors signed former Southern Illinois Salukis center Kavion Pippen, who is the nephew of Hall of Famer Scottie.
