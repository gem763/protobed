Here\u2019s Who They Are", "language": "en", "text": "Sen. Bernie Sanders said in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate that the three wealthiest Americans have more money than the bottom half of all Americans \u2014 an assertion he\u2019s made before, including at the Democratic debate in June. Sanders is referring to billionaires Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett. And according to the fact-checking news organization Politifact, Sanders is right that they\u2019re richer than half of all Americans.\n\nIn 2018, Forbes said that Bezos and his family are worth $160 billion, Gates is worth $97 billion, and Buffett is worth $88 billion. That comes to a total of $345 billion dollars.\n\nThe Guardian reported that Bezos\u2019 ex, MacKenzie Bezos, will receive $36 billion in their divorce. That would drop his worth to a paltry $124 billion, and the total worth of Bezos, Gates and Buffett to $309 billion.\n\nAlso Read: Bernie Sanders Released From Hospital After Heart Attack\n\nBut that still makes their combined wealth significantly higher than the roughly $250 billion in combined wealth for the bottom half of Americans, according to a study by the Institute for Policy Studies. The institute is a progressive think tank.\n\nPolitifact has rated Sanders\u2019 statement as true.\n\nAs the Institute reported, \u201calmost one in five American households now resides in our Underwater Nation. These households often have no savings at all or owe more than they own.\u201d\n\nSanders brought up the statistic in response to a question from CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett, who asked if he wants to tax billionaires out of existence. Sanders said he does indeed want significantly higher taxes on the wealthiest people in America.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a half-million Americans sleeping out on the street, 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you have hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt\u2026 and you have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage,\u201d Sanders said. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she agreed, and accused fellow Democrats on the debate stage of wanting to protect billionaires.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar fired back that \u201cnot even the billionaire\u201d onstage wanted to protect billionaires, referring to Tom Steyer.\n\nLawrence Yee contributed to this story.\n\nRead original story Bernie Sanders Says 3 People Are Wealthier Than Half of All Americans.
