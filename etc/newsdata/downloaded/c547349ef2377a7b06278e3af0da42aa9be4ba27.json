They make up about 45% of the Xinjiang region's population; 40% are Han Chinese.\n\nChina re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan.\n\nSince then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han Chinese and Uighurs fear erosion of their culture.\n\nXinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.", "description": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accuses the Chinese government of a \"highly repressive campaign\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15617/production/_109157578_uighurs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
