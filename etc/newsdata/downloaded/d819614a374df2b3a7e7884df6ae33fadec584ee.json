You cannot fight fire with fire,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said in his daily press conference on Friday morning. \u201cWe do not want deaths. We do not want war.\u201d\n\nBut the aborted arrest \u2013 and the chaos that it unleashed \u2013 prompted accusations that the government had simply folded in the face of cartel firepower, and cast further doubt on the president\u2019s efforts to overhaul Mexico\u2019s security strategy.\n\nEl Chapo: Mexican police capture then release drug boss's son after battle with cartel Read more\n\n\u201cThere is nothing admirable about this decision,\u201d the security expert Alejandro Hope tweeted on Friday morning. \u201cBy launching a badly planned operation that was then badly executed, the government laid itself open to being blackmailed.\u201d\n\nCarlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Centre for Research and Teaching in Economics, tweeted: \u201cFirst it was an operational disaster. Then it was communications disaster. And finally it was a political disaster.\u201d\n\nAccording to the official version, Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was detained in a house in Culiac\u00e1n between about 3pm and 5.30pm on Thursday, triggering a huge and extremely violent response from the cartel which led the authorities to withdraw from the house \u2013 leaving him behind.\n\n\u201cThe capture of a criminal cannot be worth more than the lives of people,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Men look at burnt vehicles after heavily armed gunmen waged an all-out battle against Mexican security forces in Culiac\u00e1n, Sinaloa state, Mexico, on Friday.

What there was was a failed operation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a rushed operation in which the reaction of the criminals was not taken into consideration.\u201d\n\nThe scale of that reaction stunned Mexicans, as footage shared on social media showed heavily armed cartel gunmen in the streets with panicked residents fleing to a soundtrack of gunfire. At least eight people were killed and 21 wounded in the clashes.\n\nHundreds of cartel gunmen were deployed around the city of one million people, blocking streets with burning vehicles or riding about on pickup trucks with mounted .50 calibre machine guns. Durazo said that there were 14 separate attacks on the military and 19 roadblocks were thrown up across the city.\n\nLaGaceta.me (@LaGaceta_me) #ULTIMAHORA\n\nDetienen al hijo de El Chapo Guzm\u00e1n, Iv\u00e1n Archibaldo Guzm\u00e1n, lo que est\u00e1 ocasionando una fuerte balacera en #Culiac\u00e1n #Sinaloa en esta ciudad pic.twitter.com/MjqqLsu3sx\n\nVideos also showed dozens of escaped prisoners flooding into the streets and commandeering passing vehicles at gunpoint. On Friday morning the local authorities confirmed that 49 prisoners were still at large.\n\nAdding to the confusion, authorities were slow to communicate with the panicked population, offering no explanation or comment beyond calling on people to stay indoors.\n\nThe government, however, is struggling to convince observers that it does not bear responsibility for creating the problem in the first place.\n\nOfficials said it was triggered by the \u201cprecipitated\u201d action by members of a patrol that launched into an operation to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n, on a warrant with a view to extradition, without first having secured a judicial order allowing them entrance to the house.\n\nMexico after El Chapo: new generation fights for control of the cartel Read more\n\nThe officials also insisted that the 29-year-old son of Mexico\u2019s most infamous drug baron, who is also wanted in the US on drug trafficking charges, was never actually arrested because the formal procedures were not completed.\n\nDuring his press conference L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as Amlo, insisted that time would convince the Mexican public that his government was right in aiming to put avoiding conflict with the cartels.\n\n\u201cI ask the people of Mexico not to worry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no impunity because there is no collusion between the criminals and the authorities. The line is very clear.\u201d\n\nAt least one video relating to Thursday\u2019s events seemed to contradict this: the clip shows cartel gunmen exchanging handshakes and fist-bumps with soldiers on the streets of Culiac\u00e1n.\n\nIt remained unclear how long Ovidio was held and whether there had been negotiations to secure his freedom.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A handout photo made available by El Debate de Sinaloa shows clashes between armed groups and federal forces in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico Thursday. Photograph: Luis Gerardo Magana/EL DEBATE DE HANDOUT/EPA\n\nAmlo also dismissed a question about whether the government\u2019s willingness to let Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n go had boosted the cartel\u2019s power.\n\n\u201cHow can this possibly strengthen an organization that uses violence?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey don\u2019t have reason on their side. If you use force you don\u2019t have moral authority.\u201d\n\nThe president argues his predecessors\u2019 military-led offensives against the cartels have only exacerbated Mexico\u2019s violence, but his focus on long-term crime prevention has failed to rein in the bloodshed, and the country of 125 million people now sees an average of 100 homicides every day.\n\nEarlier this week, 13 police officers were killed in ambush by gunmen from the Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the many groups contesting territory with the Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s Sinaloa federation.\n\n'They were sent to the slaughter': Mexico mourns 13 police killed in cartel ambush Read more\n\nThursday\u2019s events buried any assumption that the Sinaloa cartel had been weakened since El Chapo\u2019s extradition; the brazen show of force far outscaled the group\u2019s response on any of the three occasions when the kingpin himself was captured.\n\nUntil Thursday Ovidio had not been among the most well-known of El Chapo\u2019s many children.\n\nThe highest profile of them is usually said to be Ivan Archivaldo, who was also rumoured to have been captured or killed during Thursday\u2019s events.\n\nAlhough calm has returned to the streets of Culiac\u00e1n, tension and terror continued to reverberate on Friday. Schools were closed for the day, as were many public offices.\n\nA lawyer for the Guzm\u00e1ns said on Friday the family was grateful the security forces had treated Ovidio well.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Meza told Radio F\u00f3rmula that the family had been deeply worried when Ovidio had \u201cdisappeared\u201d. \u201cThank God it turned out he is alive, and his brother Ivan Archivaldo too,\u201d the lawyer said.", "description": "Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said security forces saved lives by releasing jailed kingpin\u2019s son after his brief capture in Culiac\u00e1n", "authors": ["Jo Tuckman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6e44988fd4bc91ff8625bc4dc88190494239f6/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b0d638ba8d9ae8c39917ce0dceb05b17", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
