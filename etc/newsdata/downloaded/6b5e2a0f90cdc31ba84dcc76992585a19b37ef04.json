I\u2019ll go round IKEA and do a refit. I\u2019m mentally moving in!\u201d\n\nPrevious Prime Ministers have used public money for renovations on the Grade-1 listed 10 Downing Street, but paid for \u201cfurniture and fittings\u201d with their own money \u2013 so perhaps Jess doesn\u2019t need to be so thrifty.\n\nTypically, PMs spend their first days in power hammering out treaties rather than hammering in nails anyway.\n\nAnd despite not even having the top job as leader of the party - or winning a general election - Jess is already planning her career after post Number 10.\n\nThe MP wants to be the first former PM to compete on Strictly Come Dancing.\n\n\u201cI do want to do Strictly,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any bones about that. I wouldn\u2019t ever do it while I\u2019m still a politician though.\n\n\"I would rather be the Prime Minister then go on Strictly, but I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t be the first ex-Prime Minister to do it. I think there is an opening. Not in a Theresa May way - I can actually dance.\"\n\nLooking forward to seeing then Phil-Bot on Satuday night TV soon.", "description": "Ambitious Labour back bencher says she wants to be first former Prime Minister to compete on Strictly", "authors": ["Kelly Allen"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572645.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS191685683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
