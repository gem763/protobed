Nuclear energy costs between $112 and $189.\n\nOver the past decade, the WNISR estimates levelized costs - which compare the total lifetime cost of building and running a plant to lifetime output - for utility-scale solar have dropped by 88% and for wind by 69%.\n\nFor nuclear, they have increased by 23%, it said.\n\nCapital flows reflect that trend. In 2018, China invested $91 billion in renewables but just $6.5 billion in nuclear.\n\nIn the United States, renewable capacity is expected to grow by 45 GW in the next three years, while nuclear and coal are set to retire a net 24 GW.\n\nChina, still the world\u2019s most aggressive nuclear builder, has added nearly 40 reactors to its grid over the last decade, but its nuclear output was still a third lower than its wind generation.\n\nAlthough several new nuclear plants are under construction, no new project has started in China since 2016.\n\nGlobal nuclear operating capacity has increased 3.4% in the past year to 370 gigawatts, a new historic maximum, but with renewable capacity growing quickly, the share of nuclear in the world\u2019s gross power generation has stayed at just over 10%.\n\nIn the decade to 2030, 188 new reactors would have to be connected to the grid to maintain the status quo, which is more than three times the rate achieved over the past decade, the WNISR estimates.\n\nIn May, the International Energy Agency warned reut.rs/2mqcG8j that a steep decline in nuclear capacity will threaten climate goals, as advanced economies could lose 25% of their nuclear capacity by 2025.", "description": "Nuclear power is losing ground to renewables in terms of both cost and capacity as its reactors are increasingly seen as less economical and slower to reverse carbon emissions, an industry report said.", "authors": ["Marton Dunai", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433180328&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N076", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
