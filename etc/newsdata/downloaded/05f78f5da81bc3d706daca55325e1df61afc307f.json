Before their bout at UFC 242 on Saturday in Abu Dhabi, Khabib Nurmagomedov and Dustin Poirier both said the same. Ferguson had definitely earned a shot at the belt.\n\n\"He\u2019s next. Tony Ferguson is next in line for the fight, if he accepts the fight. We\u2019ll see how this thing plays out, when Khabib will fight again and if Tony wants to fight,\" White said at the UFC 242 post-fight press conference.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNurmagomedov dominated Poirier, as he has so many other opponents, by taking him down and mauling him.

If for whatever reason Tony can\u2019t take the fight or doesn\u2019t want the fight at that time, then we would figure out what was next, but yeah, Conor would make a lot of sense,\" White said when asked about a potential rematch.\n\nBut why would McGregor be next when there are fighters like Justin Gaethje knocking on the door? It's all about the Benjamins.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile there are solid opponents fighting their way into the queue in the lightweight division, Khabib vs. Conor is already a proven blockbuster. When they fought at UFC 229, it accounted for the biggest mixed martial arts pay-per-view event in history. It also set gate and attendance records for in Nevada, which is the centerpoint of the sport in the United States.\n\nTRENDING > Watch Khabib Nurmagomedov make Conor McGregor quit (UFC 242 fight video)\n\nThough McGregor hasn't set foot in the Octagon since tapping out to Nurmagomedov at UFC 229, he's a superstar of the magnitude that can make demands such as an undeserved rematch. After all, he knows the kind of money that rolls through the door when he strolls into the Octagon.\n\n\"Conor McGregor wants that fight really badly,\" said White. \"And I\u2019m sure the fans would want to see it.\"\n\nFor now, however, the fight is Ferguson's to take or refuse.", "description": "UFC president Dana White has been steadfast that Tony Ferguson should get the next shot at the UFC lightweight title.
