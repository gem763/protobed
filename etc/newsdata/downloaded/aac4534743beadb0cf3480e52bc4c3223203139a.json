It usually meant sleeping with my wig on if I stayed over at his!\"\n\nHowever, by that August Abby was tired of keeping it a secret, and decided to share her alopecia with the world.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\n\"I had enough of the secret and made a Facebook post announcing that I had alopecia and that was how my boyfriend at the time found out. I was afraid of how he'd react the next time I saw him, but he told me it was cool that I opened up.\n\n\"For a long time I avoided dating because I knew that if I started dating someone, I would have to open up to them. When my boyfriend saw my Facebook post about my alopecia he really didn't care, and I realised that being bald didn't make me 'undateable'.\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\n\"I learned that most guys don't care, and I even tried out dating apps and included pictures of myself in different wigs and a picture without a wig.\n\n\"I got plenty of matches, and for most guys it turned out to be a conversation starter. Some guys said it was inspiring to them and they thought it was cool.\n\n\"Having alopecia almost works as a filter to get guys that are going to be shallow about it out of the way. If a guy thinks it's weird I have alopecia, I wouldn't be interested him anyway.\"\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\n(Image: MDWfeatures / Abby Andrew)\n\nIn 2015, Abby started a YouTube channel talking about alopecia and wigs. She said she now feels able to tell dates about her alopecia straight away and is beginning to feel more comfortable leaving the house without a wig.\n\n\"All alopecia does it make us lose our hair, which we can't control, but we can control how much we allow it to affect us emotionally,\" she said.\n\n\"Life's too short to stress about hair. I wish I had been open about alopecia sooner. I can't believe all those years I missed out on switching up wigs and letting myself have fun with it.\"", "description": "Abby Andrew from New York overcame her anxiety over her alopecia by posting a wigless photo on Facebook", "authors": ["Alyce Collins", "Pippa Allen-Kinross", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Abandrew"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564845.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Big-Bald-Secret.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
