The law also calls for a \"Robert E. Lee Day\" on January 19, and a \"Memorial Day\" or \"Confederate Decoration Day\" on June 3.\n\nFor years, opponents have been calling to change the law, citing Forrest's history of suppression and violence towards blacks. Forrest was a general for the Confederacy during the Civil War, and led Confederate forces in the Fort Pillow Massacre, where soldiers killed several hundred black troops after they surrendered, according to survivors' accounts and a federal investigation. He was also a prominent slave owner and the first Grand Wizard of the KKK.\n\nThe proclamation, which Gov. Lee signed on Wednesday, identifies Forrest as a \"recognized military figure in American history.\"\n\nWhile the proclamation itself is not new, it has drawn heightened backlash amid the ongoing national debate over the removal of Confederate statues from public spaces.\n\nSome of the outcry came from members of Lee's own party. On Friday, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas took to Twitter to condemn the governor's move, calling Forrest \"a slave trader & the 1st Grand Wizard of the KKK.\"\n\nThis is WRONG. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a Confederate general & a delegate to the 1868 Democratic Convention. He was also a slave trader & the 1st Grand Wizard of the KKK. Tennessee should not have an official day (tomorrow) honoring him. Change the law. https://t.co/XBgoRCBoI0 \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) 12 July 2019\n\nNashville Mayor David Briley, a Democrat, urged lawmakers to repeal the law, tweeting, \"Nathan Bedford Forrest was a slave owner and a racist, and no law should force us to honor him.\"\n\nNathan Bedford Forrest was a slave owner and a racist, and no law should force us to honor him. Today, I call on Nashville to remember those who fought against hate \u2014 like Diane Nash and Z. Alexander Looby \u2014 and I call on @TNHouseGOP, @TNSenateGOP, and @GovBillLee to repeal it. \u2014 Mayor David Briley (@MayorBriley) 13 July 2019\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. In remarks on Thursday, Lee said, \"I haven't even looked at that law, other than knowing I needed to comply with it, so that's what I did.\"\n\nNathan Bedford Forrest Day was first declared a holiday in 1921 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Confederate leader's birth, Eddie Weeks, a librarian for the Tennessee legislature, told The Tennessean newspaper. In 1969, this changed to a day of observation.\n\nThis isn't the first time that an effort to memorialize Forrest has sparked controversy in the state.\n\nIn 2017, former Gov. Bill Haslam called for Forrest's bust to be removed from the state Capitol, where it still stands today. Later that year, a privately owned statue of Forrest was vandalized with pink paint. In 2017, another statue of Forrest was removed from a Memphis park after it was sold to a private owner.\n\nThe tensions in Tennessee over how to memorialize Confederate leaders such as Forrest mirror a broader debate that has gone unresolved in the aftermath of the violence that erupted in Charlottesville, Va. in August 2017 between white nationalists gathered to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee and counter-demonstrators. The violence culminated in the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was protesting white supremacy.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reports that since 2015, 110 tributes or monuments to the Confederacy have been removed, but over 1,700 remain.\n\nSome Tennesseans have taken matters into their own hands, seeking to commemorate Forrest in a different way.\n\nA historical marker in downtown Memphis, sponsored by Calvary Episcopal Church, Rhodes College and the National Park Service, reads: \"Nathan Bedford Forrest operated a profitable slave trading business at this site ... In the decades after the Civil War, many white southerners chose to portray Forrest as a military hero, thus excusing or ignoring Forrest's buying and selling of human beings.\"", "description": "The day of observation for Nathan Bedford Forrest follows a decades-long tradition of honoring him and other Confederate leaders, as mandated by state law.", "authors": ["Nora Eckert"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/07/14/ap_19060112333105_wide-d796819612e24748354558c5b7463204779cd448.jpg?s=1400"}
