The opening day 4-0 victory over Chelsea was followed by a concerning slump: the 1-1 draw at Wolves, 2-1 home defeat by Crystal Palace and 1-1 draw at Southampton before the international break.\n\nBefore Leicester City arrive at Old Trafford on Saturday there is disquiet that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s coaching may lack sophistication, and he is yet to earn complete respect from those players who are sceptical.\n\nDespite being popular on a personal level and having a relaxed man-management style, there are further doubts over the 46-year-old\u2019s tactical acumen, with his record at Cardiff City, whom he took down to the Championship in May 2014, being cited.\n\nWhereas Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was not liked by some players or staff, there was a respect for a tactical and strategic prowess that allowed him to guide United to the EFL Cup and Europa League in 2016-17 and second place in the Premier League the following season.\n\nThose doubtful of Solskj\u00e6r are still to be convinced, too, that his methods can improve them in the way that those, say, of Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp and Manchester City\u2019s Pep Guardiola have with their respective players.\n\nIn one sense the doubts should not surprise. Whereas Mourinho and his predecessor, Louis van Gaal, each won titles in at least two of the big-four leagues of England, Italy, Germany and Spain, and also had European Cup success on the CV, Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s sole championship and knockout competition triumphs were achieved in Norway.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r during Manchester United\u2019s home defeat by Crystal Palace.

Now, players \u2013 who can be the first to shift responsibility when results are poor \u2013 are pointing out that these trophies were claimed in a relatively minor league. There are further questions about his ability to manage a club of United\u2019s huge global profile that attract incessant scrutiny.\n\nCloser examination of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s tenure at Cardiff suggests it should not be taken as clear-cut evidence of his being out of his depth. When he took over on 2 January 2014 Cardiff were fourth-bottom and hardly stable off the field. There had been a stand-off between Vincent Tan, the owner, and Malky Mackay, which culminated in the Scot\u2019s sacking as manager, and there was supporter disgruntlement at the Malaysian\u2019s decision to change team colours from blue to red.\n\nYet Solskj\u00e6r \u2013 admirably \u2013 took full responsibility for overseeing relegation. This occurred after he lost 12 of 18 Premier League games, managing three wins and a total of 12 points from the available 54.\n\nAlthough Solskj\u00e6r was removed eight games into the following season after winning two of the first six Championship matches, more than one of the Cardiff players relegated under him counter the view held by some at United.\n\nThe Guardian has been told that Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s training sessions were innovative, that he possessed a clear vision of how the side should play and that relegation may have been because of an attempt to implement change too quickly. The last view is in line with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s take.\n\nHis two years in charge of United reserves indicate that he is an original thinker. One example offered by a member of the side Solskj\u00e6r managed to the 2009-10 Premier Reserve League title is of him asking players to switch positions during sessions to greater understand the other\u2019s role.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r applauds Cardiff\u2019s fans after relegation from the Premier League in 2014.

Solskj\u00e6r had to deal with an expectation in Norway that having worked under the peerless Sir Alex Ferguson he could and would perform a managerial miracle.\n\nSolskj\u00e6r\u2019s response was to focus on instilling a winning mentality in his squad from the first day of pre-season. His players talk glowingly of his approach to tactics being fresh, as do those from Cardiff and United\u2019s reserves, and how he made them believe Molde could be champions for a first time in the club\u2019s 100th year. Solskj\u00e6r led them to the title in his first campaign.\n\nThe irony of Solskj\u00e6r being viewed as having doubtful credibility by a cadre who are part of a side with two league victories in 11 games (and who last won away in the competition in late February) is clear. Solskj\u00e6r remains publicly loyal to his players, yet so dire were they in the 4-0 loss at Everton at the end of last season that there was disbelief in Marco Silva\u2019s team.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThe display did prompt Solskj\u00e6r to say: \u201cI am going to be successful here and there are players who won\u2019t be part of that.\u201d\n\nHe has kept his word. Of the starting XI that day, Phil Jones and Nemanja Matic are now reserves, Chris Smalling is on loan at Roma and Fred is yet to feature in a matchday squad this term. Solskj\u00e6r is understood to have also offered stern words during half-time at Southampton two weeks ago.\n\nNone of this suggests a manager cowed by the demands of the club or weak before his squad. Solskj\u00e6r is, in fact, tougher than the easygoing persona suggests. Now, with the first rumblings of discontent, he faces the sternest test yet of his \u201cdream\u201d role.", "description": "Sceptics in the squad doubt the manager\u2019s tactics and coaching but is it wise to assume he is out of his depth?", "authors": ["Jamie Jackson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb624218742f6f433bef02a406450c7f4117b40a/0_137_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=584d54da270ea308091d2cd38faebf8c", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
