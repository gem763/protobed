REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nThe testimony of Laura Cooper, a career official, has been sought by lawmakers interested in her knowledge of alleged efforts by Trump to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine until its president committed to investigating Joe Biden, the former vice president who is a top candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nCooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defence for Russia, Ukraine, Eurasia, will appear voluntarily before the panels. The Pentagon has not blocked her from testifying.\n\nCooper\u2019s testimony will follow that of William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, who appeared before the impeachment inquiry on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor testified that he was told by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. envoy to the European Union, that Trump had linked the release of aid to public declarations by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would investigate Biden, his son Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, and an already debunked theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn an opening statement to lawmakers that U.S. media posted online, Taylor called the exchanges between Trump, his advisers and Ukraine a \u201crancorous story about whistleblowers ... quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections.\u201d\n\nIn August, an unnamed whistleblower reported having received information from multiple officials that Trump, in a July 25 phone call, had asked Zelenskiy to commit to investigating the Bidens before he would release $391 million in security assistance approved by the U.S. Congress to help combat Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.\n\nFederal election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election. Taylor\u2019s testimony ran counter to Trump\u2019s contention that there was no quid pro quo or wrongdoing. The president has accused Democrats of trying to oust him to prevent his re-election.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said on Tuesday, as Taylor wrapped up his testimony. \u201cToday was just more triple hearsay and selective leaks from the Democrats\u2019 politically-motivated, closed door, secretive hearings,\u201d she added.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, three Democratic U.S. senators sent a \u201cFreedom of Information Act\u201d request to U.S. Attorney General William Barr seeking any of his or Deputy Attorney General Jeremy Rosen\u2019s correspondence referencing members of the Trump administration with Ukrainian, Turkish and other leaders.\n\nThey also asked for all records of interactions between Justice Department officials and the governments of Ukraine and China about Trump\u2019s potential political opponents and any White House requests to investigate the Bidens.\n\nIn the letter, Senators Kamala Harris, Sheldon Whitehouse and Richard Blumenthal said the whistleblower complaint and recent testimony \u201craise serious concerns about the Justice Department\u2019s involvement in politically-motivated investigations, at the behest of the White House.\u201d", "description": "A top Pentagon official who oversees policy on Ukraine and Russia is expected to testify on Wednesday before the U.S. House of Representatives panels leading an impeachment inquiry of Republican President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444063521&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0PZ", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
