They're also finding it hard to pay the ever-increasing prices that Apple charges to keep its sales revenue growing, even as the volumes of iPhones sales are declining.\n\nApple price chart\n\nIn the most recent , for example, Apple experienced a 12% decline in iPhone sales. This was the first quarter since 2013 in which iPhones didn\u2019t account for the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue, according to eMarketer. This after the company's flagship smartphone made up more than half of the company's sales last year, and is still crucial for the company\u2019s future growth, at least in the short-to-medium term.\n\nDespite this generally bearish environment for Apple stock \u2014 which has fallen 2.3% over the past year, while the Index has gained 3.5% \u2014 we have been advising investors to focus on the company\u2019s ability to innovate and thrive when faced with challenges.\n\nThe company's latest initiatives to diversify its revenue away from iPhones and to make the best use of its product ecosystem came last week when the company introduced its new iPhone model and combined it with its video-streaming service, which is set to be the cheapest among all available in the market.\n\nApple priced its streaming video service, Apple TV+, at $4.99 per month. It\u2019s also giving customers a year of Apple TV+ for free if they buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV box. Along with this competitive streaming pricing, Apple also priced iPhone 11 at $699, which is $50 lower than the XR model launched last year.\n\nCreative Incentives to Win Customers\n\nThis is a creative incentive that we see working to attract customers, as Apple TV+ low pricing and a free trial for a year position the company to build a loyal subscriber base that can be charged more once its video library grows.\n\nApple is expected to sell about 70 million new iPhones through the holiday season, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. In addition to iPhones, Apple will also sell millions more Macs, iPads and Apple TVs. A new Apple TV+ service offered free with these devices could make its streaming service one of the largest within just the next few months. And Wall Street\u2019s top analysts agree.\n\n\u201cTV+ pricing is lower than expected and the bundling of 12-months free TV+ with a purchase of most devices creates a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded streaming video market,\u201d according to Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, who put Apple stock in her basket of top picks for 2020.\n\n\u201cSecond, Apple didn\u2019t raise prices relative to comparable product launches last year after several years of price increases,\u201d Huberty said.\n\nApple seems to be succeeding in its plan to revive its sales growth and diversify its revenue away from iPhones. The company\u2019s services, which include Apple Music, movie rentals and app downloads, produced 33% growth last year with sales touching $40 billion\u2014accounting for about 15% of the company\u2019s total of $265.6 billion.\n\nThat contribution will definitely accelerate once the company\u2019s new line of services \u2014- video-streaming, Apple Pay and gaming \u2014 start to chip in. According to an estimate by Morgan Stanley, the services contribution will continue to grow and could generate about 60% of Apple\u2019s revenue in the next five years.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAfter sinking as low as $142 a share in January, Apple shares rebounded sharply, and are now up almost 40% since the start of the year after closing at $218.75 on Friday. We believe this move upward isn't done yet, especially now that the U.S. and China have returned to the negotiating table to seek a resolution of their trade dispute \u2014 which, if unresolved, has the potential to hurt Apple\u2019s suppliers and its sales in China. A creative product launch and improvements on the macro front are setting up Apple stock for a powerful rally going forward.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: S&P 500, Apple Inc.
