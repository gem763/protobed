Nonetheless, the coin has had quite an adventurous week price-wise. Though it was in the green the whole week, and it seemed that it might continue its upward trajectory, it failed to hold the USD 190 level.\n\nETH price chart:\n\nDuring the conference, discussions were led on the transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0, which garnered Cryptoverse\u2019s attention, bringing with it both support and criticism. The Ethereum\u2019s native token\u2019s price continued to climb, reaching USD 183 on October 9th. Meanwhile, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of blockchain company ConsenSys, came up with a mission to get 1 million developers to build on Ethereum by Devcon 6 to be held next year. This coincided with the coin\u2019s price stepping over the USD 190 level to USD 193 yesterday, appreciating 9% in a week.\n\nThese price developments can be seen in the chart showing ETH\u2019s past seven days. While it was trading sideways since the beginning of October, it fell to USD 171 on October 6th and 7th, after which this latest rally occurred. After a peak on October 8th, when the price climbed to USD 184, a few standard fluctuations can be seen, but this is followed by a sudden jump in price from October 9th\u2019s USD 183 to USD 193.7 that very same day. It continued to climb \u2013 meanwhile getting the news that the new Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Heath Tarbert, believes it to be a commodity \u2013 and it finally reached USD 195.3 on October 11th, which is the highest price ETH has seen since the plunge on September 24th.\n\nAs it came, so it went. In the Cryptoverse, the speed by which a price climbs or drops is hardly surprising. Nonetheless, it\u2019s worth following these developments and in this case noting that after two days of its price being above USD 190, it\u2019s now (14:15 UTC) back to USD 185. It appreciated 5.2% in the past week, comparing to that 9% just a day ago.\n\nIn the top 10 coins category, only bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) are in the red in the past week, but ETH\u2019s gains, when ranked, fall somewhere in the top half on the list at the moment, between binance coin\u2019s (BNB) 7.69% and stellar\u2019s (XLM) 1.01%. The last 24 hours, however, turned bloody for all 10.", "description": "The price of the second coin by market capitalization, ethereum (ETH), fell below USD 190, while its weekly gains are 4 percentage points lower than just a day ago.", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/09ddebd28c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
