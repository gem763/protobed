But we have never heard of website and certainly do not endorse it\n\nWhich? warned that financial companies are exploiting confusion around savings products by failing to make it clear that unregulated investments can be wiped out.\n\nIts research found online adverts 'blurred the lines' between low-risk cash savings accounts and high-risk investments.\n\nWhich? found internet searches for Isas and savings accounts using generic terms like 'best Isa rates' returned results for products that promised high returns but gave no warning of the fact that they were high-risk schemes.\n\nA number of these were paid-for adverts on Google \u2013 meaning they would appear prominently at the top and bottom of a search page.\n\nThe products are not illegal but prospective savers are unlikely to be made aware either of what their money is being deposited into or of the risks.\n\nThis advert, on a site called 'uk-investment-bond.co.uk' touts an investment return of 45% over 5 years, but doesn't tell you where your money is invested. It also claims FSCS protection, something Innovative Finance Isas do not have\n\nThis is Money has been campaigning for the financial watchdog to crack down on such promotions and act before people lose money rather than react when they do.\n\nOver recent years we have flagged repeated instances of promotions with elements such as high interest rate returns, promises of guarantees and the use of elements of regulated entities.\n\nFor example, This is Money recently discovered a website called 'Your Isa', which advertised 'asset backed' Isas offering 8.4 per cent a year on a fixed term. The company behind it, Global Property Markets, was a lead generator not authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nIt told This is Money it was 'a marketing and introduction company for various Isa providers', but declined to give us any of the names of those providers, nor did it explain what money would be invested in beyond 'publicly listed retail bonds'.\n\nThe issue of lead generators has received a much higher profile since the collapse of investment firm London Capital & Finance. 11,500 people \u2013 many of whom were elderly savers \u2013 lost \u00a3237million after investing in unregulated mini-bonds, the returns on which were advertised on Isa comparison sites.\n\nCasual investors who poured money into a failed \u00a37.5million mini-bond solar panel scheme have also only just succeeded in getting \u00a35million back from the Financial Ombudsman Service after a four-year fight for compensation.\n\nGoogling the term 'best Isa rates' delivered a list of paid for results above. It would be very difficult for many ordinary savers to work out how risky these investments are\n\nWhich?'s study also found nine in 10 of those surveyed people were unaware that regulated companies are allowed to sell unregulated products.\n\nThe chairman of the FCA, Charles Randell, recently gave a speech in which he said the issue of regulated firms promoting unregulated investments was 'ripe for re-examination.'\n\nHe said phrases like 'secured' or 'asset-backed', which are common parlance on risky online investment adverts could be banned. He said they were 'often highly misleading'.\n\nJenny Ross, editor of Which? Money, said: 'It's concerning to see that despite thousands of savers losing millions as a result of risky, unregulated investments, savers are continuing to be confused and misled as a result of ads omitting crucial information about risk.'", "description": "Which? found more people were drawn to adverts promising high returns than those which explained that investors' capital could be at risk in the event things went wrong.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "City", "Finance Reporter For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
