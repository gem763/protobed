Demonstrators called for their country, the world\u2019s largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\u201cEven though we ourselves aren\u2019t sick, the planet which we live on is, and we are protesting and fighting for it,\u201d said Siobhan Sutton, a 15-year-old student at Perth Modern School.\n\nOrganizers estimate more than 300,000 protesters took to Australian streets in what would be the country\u2019s biggest demonstration since the Iraq War in 2003.\n\nSmaller protests took place in Asia, from the Philippines to Hong Kong and India.\n\n\u201cWe need to reclaim our constitutional right to clean air and water,\u201d said Aman Sharma, a 16-year-old protester in India\u2019s capital New Delhi.\n\nRallies were also planned in Europe, Africa and the United States, where organizers say more than 800 events are expected Friday.\n\nIn Germany, which has seen large-scale climate rallies for over a year, police said 17,000 people had gathered in the southwestern city of Freiburg, one of 500 cities across the country where protests were planned.\n\nIn the capital Berlin and Germany\u2019s financial hub of Frankfurt, some protesters staged brief road blockades to highlight their demands for a drastic reduction in the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, to which transport is a major contributor.\n\nUnder pressure from sustained protests over the past months, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is planning to announce a package of measures to reduce Germany\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions later Friday.\n\nRallies were also held in Kenya\u2019s capital Nairobi, Johannesburg and the South African capital, Pretoria.\n\nExperts say Africa is the most vulnerable continent to climate change and the least equipped to deal with it. Governments have pleaded for more support from the international community.\n\nThe protests are partly inspired by the activism of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, who has staged weekly demonstrations under the heading \u201cFridays for Future\u201d over the past year, calling on world leaders to step up their efforts against climate change. Thunberg is expected to speak at the U.N. Climate Action Summit on Monday.\n\nAustralian universities have said they will not penalize students for attending Friday\u2019s rallies, while Australian schools vary on what action, if any, they take against children who skip classes to attend demonstrations.\n\nPerth student Sutton said she would fail a math exam by attending a protest in the west coast city of Perth.\n\n\u201cI have basically been told that because it is not a valid reason to be missing school - it is not a medical reason or anything - I am going to get a zero on the test if I don\u2019t actually sit it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said her math teacher had given her the option to sit the exam before Friday, but she was unable to do so because of her commitments as one of the protest organizers.\n\nActing Prime Minister Michael McCormack said students should be in school.\n\n\u201cThese sorts of rallies should be held on a weekend where it doesn\u2019t actually disrupt business, it doesn\u2019t disrupt schools, it doesn\u2019t disrupt universities,\u201d McCormack told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cI think it is just a disruption,\u201d he added.\n\nSome companies are encouraging their employees to join the climate strike.\n\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions, which represents labor unions, said it supported employees taking time off work to protest.\n\nThe council said in a statement that it \u201cmust take a stand for our future when our government will not.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMcGuirk reported from Canberra, Australia.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of protesters in Australia, many of them children who skipped school, kicked off a day of demonstrations around the world against climate change in the run-up to a U.N. summit in New York.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Rod Mcguirk", "Frank Jordans"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/belgium_climate_92768_c0-240-6654-4119_s1770x1032.jpg?4baa1ef24477e9b6c1d20cf4e1d9e6d07d1df5fc", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
