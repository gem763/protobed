(sdominick/Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nA man in New Zealand was called into a work meeting and feared the worst. So he hired an emotional support clown to join him.\n\nFor Joshua Jack, the suspicion he might lose his job was right on the nose.\n\nSpeaking to Newshub NZ on a video call, Jack confirmed his employer, advertising agency FCB, let him go this week. But having Joe the clown along for the ride definitely \u201clightened the mood,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen his supervisors scheduled the meeting, he said he \u201cthought it\u2019s either a promotion or worse.\"\n\n\u201cI thought it\u2019s best to bring in a professional and so I paid $200 and hired a clown,\u201d he added.\n\nBy the time the meeting was over, Jack didn\u2019t have a job. But he did have two balloon animals: a unicorn and a poodle.\n\nThe process to blow them up and shape them got \u201crather noisy,\u201d he said, and the meeting attendees \u201chad to tell [Joe the clown] to be quiet from time to time.\u201d\n\nFCB could not immediately be reached for comment. But the New Zealand Herald obtained a photograph showing a man with his face blurred out sitting in an office next to a clown, who is wearing, well, a clown outfit, and what appears to be an inflatable hat. The clown reportedly also mimed crying expressions as Jack went over the paperwork describing his termination.\n\nWhen asked by Newshub NZ how his former colleagues reacted, Jack said they \u201cthought it spiced up the meeting.\u201d\n\nEmotional support clowns are typically used in situations with children that require a bit more, well, emotional support.\n\nThe U.S. branch of Clowns Without Borders opened in 1995, and describes itself as an organization that \u201cbrings laughter where it\u2019s needed most.\u201d The group sends clowns on missions to conflict zones, refugee camps and places experiencing emergencies to play with children and offer them an opportunity to momentarily escape their suffering.\n\nNot everyone, however, perceives clowns as source of joy.\n\nIn recent years there have been increased reports of frightening clowns threatening people in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2016, a school district in Ohio even shut down schools after reported clown sightings caused widespread panic.\n\nThe American clown craze soon spread to the United Kingdom, where police said clown sightings increased in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe believe this to be part of a much larger prank which is currently sweeping across the U.S.A. and parts of the U.K.,\u201d British police said at the time.\n\nBy Oct. 2017, the craze had made it to Israel, where teenagers donned clown costumes and held weapons, terrifying passersby.\n\nIn the United States, it\u2019s more common to hear stories of emotional support animals gone awry.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Dexter, an emotional support peacock, for example, ruffled a few feathers when he tried to board a United Airlines flight last year, despite repeated communications between his owner and the airline that confirmed the peacock did not meet boarding standards.\n\nA spokeswoman for the airline told The Washington Post at the time that Dexter\u2019s weight and size made him incompatible for the flight.\n\n\u201cWe explained this to the customer on three separate occasions before they arrived at the airport,\u201d she said.\n\nLast year, Frontier Airlines asked a woman to deboard a flight after it emerged she had brought along her \u201cemotional support squirrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cRodents, including squirrels, are not allowed on Frontier flights,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn 2016, Wisconsin resident Carla Fitzgerald managed to bring her \u201cemotional support duck,\u201d complete with a Captain America diaper and red shoes, on board a flight from Charlotte to Asheville. When photos of Daniel the duck went viral on social media, she said she was surprised by the attention. \u201cHaving an emotional support duck is normal \u2014 it\u2019s my new normal,\u201d she said.\n\nDelta Air Lines tightened restrictions on emotional support animals last year after the number of passengers trying to bring them on board skyrocketed, which in turn led to a dramatic uptick in incidents where passengers were attacked by animals on board.\n\nAs for Jack, he has since found a new job and starts next week, he told Newshub NZ. The Post has been unable to confirm if Joe the clown will be by his side on his first day.\n\nRead more:\n\nNew Zealand\u2019s DIY coffin clubs take the sting out of aging and death for many\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world", "description": "For New Zealanders Joshua Jack and Joe the clown, the meeting was no laughing matter.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk", "Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady", "Staff Writer", "Foreign Desk", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dlcEb7AIxYXk3wDLD90ZSSJRWqU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BC2XQ4WWGYI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
