Mr. Biden, instead of insisting that Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor be fired, might have insisted he prove his bona fides by reopening his dormant Burisma investigation. We just can\u2019t know. This is why the mere \u201cappearance\u201d of a conflict of interest is rightly considered compromising to U.S. policy (as the vice president\u2019s own aides reportedly tried to warn him).\n\nBut all such questions now are illegitimate in a rush to paint Mr. Trump as impeachable. MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough quotes the White House transcript until its words no longer suit him and then invents his own to portray Mr. Trump as asking for information to \u201csmear an opponent.\u201d\n\nThe transcript says no such thing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Holman Jenkins", "Wsj.Com Articles"], "top_image": ""}
