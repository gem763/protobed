Greinke is the onetime ace the Astros acquired from Arizona in July specifically to win games such as this; Tanaka is the Yankees\u2019 undisputed October ace, his career postseason record now 5-2 with a 1.32 ERA.\n\nTorres, 22, also doubled, singled and drove in five runs, looking, as he has all month, like the best player on the field. Between their sweep of the Minnesota Twins in the Division Series and Saturday night\u2019s blowout win, the Yankees have outscored opponents by a margin of 30-7 this postseason.\n\n\u201cSmart, confident,\u201d Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said of Torres. \u201cThe intelligence part is big, because it\u2019s allowed him to grow and get better at all the little things. He likes playing in these situations, and he\u2019s confident in his ability to produce. That leads to a dangerous player.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros had gone to great lengths \u2014 leaning on their regulars through the season\u2019s final days, despite a division lead that swelled to 10 games by the end \u2014 to hold off the Yankees and earn the right to host games 1, 2, 6 and 7 at Minute Maid Park, where they went a major-league-best 60-21 this season and 3-0 against the Tampa Bay Rays in the division series.\n\nBut if the Yankees were going to steal one in Houston, this was the one. Greinke, the Astros\u2019 prized trade-deadline pickup, had lasted just 3 \u2154 innings against the Tampa Bay Rays in Game 3 of the Division Series, and for all his pedigree and track record \u2014 not to mention a 2.93 ERA this season \u2014 he is not the same sort of uncomfortable at-bat that aces Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole will present in Games 2 and 3.\n\n\u201cTo come in here and beat them in their own house,\u201d Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge said, \u201cthat\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGreinke was starting Game 1, instead of Verlander or Cole, because the Astros had been pushed to five games by the Rays in their first-round series, while the Yankees were sweeping the Twins. Among the ways those divergent outcomes affected this series: Astros pitchers threw nearly 250 more pitches in the Division Series than their Yankees counterparts.\n\nThe Yankees are a deeper, better version of the team that lost to the Astros in seven games in the 2017 ALCS. That team was nicknamed the \u201cBaby Bombers\u201d for all the fresh-faced neophytes on their roster, all of whom \u2014 Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Luis Severino et al. \u2014 have the benefit of those two extra years of experience.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the only way in which these Yankees are better.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of Greg Bird at first base, they have top-five MVP candidate D.J. LeMahieu. Instead of Starlin Castro at second base, they have Torres. Instead of Todd Frazier at third, they have Gio Urshela, who slugged .534 this season and homered in the ninth inning Saturday night. Instead of Chase Headley as their primary designated hitter, they have Stanton and Edwin Encarnacion, the former a two-time home run champ, the latter a one-time RBI champ. Lefty James Paxton is in their rotation, slated to start Game 2 Sunday night, and Adam Ottavino and Zack Britton in their bullpen.\n\nAD\n\nBoth starting pitchers worked aggressively in the strike zone Saturday night, leading to early strikes, quick outs and low pitch-counts. Greinke breezed through his first three innings in just 28 pitches, but in the fourth, LeMahieu and Torres both ambushed his first pitch, leading to a single and an RBI double that gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead. Two innings later, Torres attacked another first-pitch from Greinke, smashing this one into the Crawford Boxes in left. And two batters after that, Stanton homered into the Astros\u2019 bullpen in right-center.\n\n\u201cVery encouraged,\u201d Boone said of Stanton, who has struggled for consistency after missing most of the season with injuries.\n\nAD\n\nTanaka, meantime, used every pitch in his extensive arsenal \u2014 fastball, splitter, slider, curve and change-up \u2014 to keep the Astros guessing, his slider a particularly effective weapon. The only two base\n\nAD\n\nrunners he allowed through the game\u2019s first four innings, a single by Astros rookie Kyle Tucker and a walk to Alex Bregman, were erased on double plays.\n\nThe first of these was a fairly standard 5-4-3 twin-killing, but the second required an exceptional play by Judge, the Yankees\u2019 right fielder, who expertly read Yordan Alvarez\u2019s high liner, speared it and made a strong throw to first to double up Bregman \u2014 who appeared mystified that the liner had died in Judge\u2019s glove.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI should\u2019ve remembered [Judge] is 6-9 and really athletic,\u201d Bregman said. \u201cHe made a great play, and he\u2019s got a heck of an arm. I thought it was over his head for sure.\u201d\n\nTanaka had thrown only 68 pitches and shown not even the slightest sign of faltering when Boone pulled him at the end of the sixth, just as the top of the Astros\u2019 lineup would be coming to the plate for the third time.\n\nAD\n\nThis type of move, maddening to old-timers who prefer their starters pitch until their arms fall off, is nonetheless standard for the Yankees \u2014 especially with Tanaka, who this year held opposing batters to a .637 OPS his first time through the order, and .730 the second time, but a whopping .943 the third time. It was well understood, by the Astros and everyone else, that there would be no third time in this series.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this point [in the season], I don\u2019t think you really consider the number of pitches that much,\u201d Tanaka said through a translator. \u201cFor me, it wasn\u2019t much of a surprise being pulled out after the sixth inning.\u201d\n\nOttavino, a right-hander, handled the seventh, and Britton, a lefty, the eighth. But the size of the Yankees\u2019 lead afforded Boone the luxury of sparing closer Aroldis Chapman, so it was Jonathan Loaisiga who handled the ninth, with the stands emptying by the minute and the typical energy in this building all but gone. The Astros went down in order; they managed just three hits over the course of the game, and are hitting just .224 with 19 runs scored in six games this postseason.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe really haven\u2019t done anything offensively this postseason,\u201d Bregman said.\n\nAD\n\nTwo years after the memorable 2017 ALCS, much is the same between the Astros and Yankees, from their primary protagonists to the distance between them and the rest of their league. But after Saturday night, just one game in, this ALCS already feels significantly different.\n\nRead more on baseball:", "description": "Two years after falling to Houston in Game 7, New York seizes upper hand with a thorough 7-0 win in Game 1.", "authors": ["Dave Sheinin", "National Baseball Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1jmlKCX_gdPO1sumEoPyAPA_gBc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OGOB6DHNNMI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
