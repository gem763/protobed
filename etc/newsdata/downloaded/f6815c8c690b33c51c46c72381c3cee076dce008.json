(Jose Luis Magana/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nColumnist\n\nYou never want to blame victims.\n\nWhen people are hurt or injured physically or financially, that\u2019s not the time to berate them for a decision that may have contributed to their suffering. No, you show compassion and you try to assist them in their recovery.\n\nBut you can use their experience to help them in the future or to warn others so that they don\u2019t make the same mistakes.\n\nThis is how I see the aftermath of hurricanes. How can you not empathize with the victims of Hurricane Dorian after looking at the photos of the utter devastation the storm caused in the Bahamas? And now the storm is expected to cause historic flooding on the East Coast.\n\nRead: \u2018Life-threatening\u2019 storm surge, torrential rains and hurricane force winds pound the Carolinas as Hurricane Dorian grinds north\n\nYet, it\u2019s hard not to wonder why \u2014 when ordered to evacuate ahead of a massive storm that threatens life and property \u2014 people refuse to leave. Why don\u2019t they go?\n\nIt\u2019s so easy to see fault in the actions of others, but let\u2019s look at why people don\u2019t heed a warning to evacuate during a natural disaster. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted six weeks after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005, looked at the reasons people didn\u2019t leave. Here\u2019s why.\n\n\u2014 They couldn\u2019t afford to help themselves. When Katrina hit many residents were criticized for their \u201cchoice\u201d to stay during the storm. But they didn\u2019t flee because they were being reckless. They didn\u2019t have the financial resources to find alternative housing. They didn\u2019t have a means of transportation to get out.\n\nRead: Hurricanes can bring financial disasters. Are you prepared?\n\n\u2014 They believed they could handle the crisis. The Katrina poll found that people 57 percent of people who didn\u2019t evacuate misjudged the severity of the storm. Forty percent didn\u2019t think it would be that bad, or thought that prior hurricanes turned out not to be as severe as predicted.\n\n\u2014 They underestimated the crisis. They thought their homes could withstand the storm.\n\n\u2014 They waited too long. By the time they realized how bad Katrina really was, they couldn\u2019t leave.\n\nNow, let\u2019s juxtaposition the same reasons people don\u2019t evacuate during a hurricane to how people respond to a financial crisis.\n\n\u2014 They can\u2019t afford to help themselves. If faced with an unexpected $400 expense, 4 in 10 adults said they would not have the money to cover it, according to a report last year from the Federal Reserve. To get the funds, they would have to sell something or borrow.\n\nRead: Does America have a savings crisis?\n\nThere are many people who can afford to save but don\u2019t. Instead they chose to live above their means.\n\nRead: Here\u2019s one way to stop living paycheck to paycheck\n\n\u2014 They believe they can handle the crisis. I talk to a lot of parents who aren\u2019t saving for their child\u2019s education. They believe their kids are so academically and/or athletically talented that they will get enough scholarships to largely pay for college. These parents are misjudging the situation.\n\nRead: Your child probably won\u2019t get a full ride to college\n\nRead more:\n\nCommunity college should be a first choice, not a last resort\n\nWhy you can\u2019t rely on generous grandparents to fund your child\u2019s college\n\n\u2014 They underestimate the situation. Many families are struggling under the weight of student loans. Outstanding student loans for the first quarter of 2019 were $1.49 trillion, according to the latest Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s Household Debt and Credit report.\n\n\u201cMuch of the debate about college today focuses on tuition and mounting student debt, with Democratic presidential candidates even raising the possibility of forgiving all student loans,\u201d wrote Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. \u201cNot enough attention is paid to risk. Spending tens of thousands of dollars annually on four years of college (or more), with little promise that it will pay off in the form of a good job, is a big gamble.\u201d\n\nRead: There\u2019s too much emphasis on reducing student loans and not enough on reducing risk\n\nThen there is the looming problem that many people aren\u2019t saving enough for retirement.\n\nRead: Is $1 million enough to retire? Why this benchmark is both real and unrealistic.\n\n\u2014 They wait too long. The time to start worrying about paying for college isn\u2019t when your child is applying to schools as a high school senior. You need to start planning and preparing when they are infants.\n\nRead: Should you start saving for college even before your child is born?\n\nWhen it comes to saving for retirement, make it a priority decades before you plan to stop working.\n\nRead: How quickly should new graduates start saving for retirement?\n\nYou may tell yourself that of course you would heed the advice to evacuate during a hurricane. But stop for a moment and think about how you are managing your money. Are you ignoring warnings that could help you weather a financial storm?\n\nColor of Money Question of the Week\n\nWhat financial lessons can you learn from the impact of a major storm?
