It was not an illusion, just a prizefight in the end.\n\nCampbell was hurt, dazed, heavily dropped, his body broken, saved by the bell in one round, in a desperate way at times and still he moved his feet feet and let his punches go to make Lomachenko look normal again and again. Lomachenko you see, was not created equal as a boxer, and he entered the ring after only 14 fights as a champion in three weight divisions, as a man on the very brink of writing his own history in a sport where his presence next to the genuine greats was discussed seriously. The enigma from the old Soviet republic was a problem for the keepers of boxing\u2019s holy scripture.\n\nAt the end of 12 rounds Lomachenko retained his WBA and WBO lightweight titles, added the WBC version when the judges delivered very wide scores of 119-109 and two of 119-108. It was harsh on Campbell, he arguably won four rounds and made all twelve competitive. The ugly physical struggle by officials from the three sanctioning bodies to drape their little darling in their gaudy baubles should never be repeated. Lomachenko looked uncomfortable as the men fought over the positions of their trophies, on his tired body, like three demented window dressers fixing tacky bras on a mannequin.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

However, any attempt to make Lomachenko normal ignores Campbell\u2019s role in a night of wonder. It would be premature, possibly outrageous, to say Campbell exposed Lomachenko, but he certainly put a hefty dent in the increasingly sacred narrative, especially at the lightweight poundage.\n\nCampbell has known Lomachenko, boxed next to him, before him and after him on afternoons, nights and odd mornings at tournaments all over the world for the last 16 years; they won gold medals together, they shared glory and during the journey Campbell lost all fear of Lomachenko. In the O2 ring a brave, dangerous and fearless attitude turned a predicted masterclass, a potential boxing massacre, into a truly absorbing fight. Campbell lost, make no mistake, but he pushed Lomachenko in every single round.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nThere was something lost in translation, trust me, when Lomachenko said at the end that Campbell had given him a \u201cgood fight.\u201d It was far more than that and will probably be the fight that persuades Lomachenko to reverse through the weights and fight smaller men in his future. Long before Lomachenko\u2019s tiny fist was raised a list of great lightweights formed in my head, a top ten without Lomachenko\u2019s looming presence \u2013 Campbell\u2019s size and heart did that to my thinking. It seems that, just perhaps, the journey by Lomachenko through so many complex layers of boxing history stalled on Saturday night.\n\nCampbell won the first, Lomachenko the second \u2013 it was a pattern they followed for a few more rounds. Lomachenko looked happy at the start, cocky at times, often getting his feet ready, feinting to throw by moving his head, dipping a shoulder and then rolling in his special way to safety, out of Campbell\u2019s considerable range. Lomachenko has done that before, does it all the time and it is generally a dreaded warning that in the coming rounds he will not so innocently move away. It was perhaps the fight\u2019s only illusion.\n\nAs the bell sounded to end round five, Lomachenko connected with a sickening left under the right arm and Campbell\u2019s body jerked, his face contorted and he actually lifted a foot up off the canvas. It looked \u2013 like so many other fights \u2013 like the start of the end; in round six Campbell came out, knowing one more tap on his liver and he would be dribbling and crying on his knees, but he won the round. It was, I thought, 3-2 in rounds. We had a fight, make no mistake.\n\nA looping left uppercut, once deliciously called a bolo punch, clearly hurt Lomachenko in the seventh, but he won the round, discarding the elegance and having to fight. The eighth was the same and then Campbell \u2013 so deep in the struggle \u2013 nicked the ninth. They say Sly Stallone was ringside (he\u2019s hard to spot in a towering crowd) and perhaps he was jotting down on an old fag packet a plot for an implausible boxing movie. I gave Campbell the tenth and going into round eleven, with over 18,000 still on their feet, I had it 6-4 in rounds.\n\nIn round eleven, Campbell was down with less than a minute to go, his body could take the torture from Lomachenko\u2019s fists no more. He showed the pain, regained his feet and then something truly memorable happened inside that wonderful O2 ring: Lomachenko stood back, held off, looked at Campbell and then the bell sounded. It was bedlam, a bit of Hollywood in south London and it was midnight. Lomachenko, clearly drained, won the last, was quick to complain when a shot dipped low and both finished with marks and bruises. The scores were brutal, but it was not about rounds in the end. Campbell left the ring in a hurry to be observed by the doctors at the venue in the privacy of his dressing room and not under the searing neon of the ring. He is fine, just exhausted.\n\n\u201cI will tell you,\u201d said Bob Arum, now 87 and in some category far beyond veteran. \u201cLoma is pushing it at lightweight. He can go down in weight \u2013 he will not go up in weight.\u201d There is a loose plan for a fight with the dangerous, erratic and troubled Gervonta Davis, who is under Floyd Mayweather\u2019s dubious protection. However, Arum is not convinced: \u201cRight now Gervonta Davis is not ready for Loma \u2013 Gervonta Davis might never be ready for Loma.\u201d Arum has obviously started early negotiations.\n\nIt will always be Campbell\u2019s finest hour, the most glorious of defeats. Meanwhile, the men in the Lomachenko business will plan his future with sense and grace. It was a pleasure to be ringside for it, an often dreamlike night watching old-fashioned boxing magic.", "description": "They came for Vasyl Lomachenko sorcery inside the O2 ring on Saturday night and stood as Luke Campbell simply refused to be mesmerised by the boxing magic of the little Ukrainian genius.
