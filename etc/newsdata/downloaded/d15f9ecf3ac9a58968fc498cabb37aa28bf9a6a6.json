Rides like that win you races and that\u2019s why he\u2019s one of the best.\u201d\n\nThat's a double for Joao Moreira! 2\u20e3 The Brazilian secures his first win for @DJWhyteJockey at his first ride for the stable! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/ptzyjXEohm \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 12, 2019\n\nThe first-year trainer admitted the instincts that helped him to 1,813 wins in Hong Kong as a jockey still kick in when his horses race.\n\n\u201cI visualise myself on them. When I was watching the race and they were going around the turn and seeing [Simple Elegant] in front, I was just saying \u2018don\u2019t pull out, just stay behind the one in front and he\u2019ll take you up to the 200m and you\u2019ll go by him\u2019,\u201d Whyte said.\n\nMoreira was in the box seat in the run, trailed leader Simple Elegant into the straight before easing off the rail about 300m from home and going to toe to toe with Michael Chang Chun-wai\u2019s Golden Four in the run to the line.\n\n\u201cJoao won the race, had he pulled out and gone around the other horse, we were there to be beaten and Golden Four would have got his shot,\u201d Whyte said.\n\nRelentless Me hung on to win by a short head to take his record to a win and a second for Whyte after three wins in 26 starts for Chris So Wai-yin.\n\n\u201cI think the key to him is that he likes to be a little bit fresh. First-up I did slightly less with him than my normal ones but he still managed to run well,\u201d Whyte said.\n\n\u201cHe let down and he showed a bit of tenacity when Golden Four came at him. He stuck his neck out and he wanted to win today.\n\nNine rides, five wins.\n\n\n\nTake another bow, Joao Moreira!\n\n\n\nJoy Master\n\nRelentless Me\n\nBeauty Day\n\nAethero\n\nCraig's Star #HKracing pic.twitter.com/PiRFQDwzrw \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cHe used to be keen and didn\u2019t really hit the line. I put blinkers on him to make him focus and they have done just that.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only aboard Relentless Me that Moreira\u2019s class shone through, with the Brazilian landing five winners for the afternoon to continue a phenomenal run that has now netted 16 winners in the last five meetings.\n\nHe kicked things off with Joy Master in the opening event before rounding out proceedings with three on the bounce, Beauty Day, Aethero and Craig\u2019s Star all getting the chocolates.\n\nThe haul takes Moreira to 23 winners for the term and sees him open up a gap on rival Zac Purton, who only had one victory on Saturday and sits on 17.\n\nPayback time for Savvy Yeung\n\nJockey Keith Yeung Ming-lun settled a score at Sha Tin on Saturday, winning aboard Savvy Six nearly 18 months after the horse wreaked havoc on the way to the starting gates.\n\nAfter refusing to proceed to the gates for a race in May last year, Savvy Six\u2019s bridle came loose and then fell off, with the horse galloping freely with Yeung in the saddle before being scratched.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s payback, two seasons ago the whole bridle came off and he just took off on me,\u201d Yeung said.\n\nYeung hadn\u2019t been aboard Savvy Six since and wouldn\u2019t have been on Saturday either if not for the misfortune of Matthew Chadwick, who was slated to ride the horse but was stood down on Friday due to a viral infection.\n\nKeith Yeung gets a nice pick-up ride as the mercurial Savvy Six gets his first Hong Kong win! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/C7Wexskvde \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 12, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate for him but good for me,\u201d Yeung smiled.\n\nIt\u2019s been a big week for Yeung, who landed his 250th winner at Happy Valley on Wednesday to outride his two-pound local rider allowance.\n\nSavvy Six\u2019s win in the Class Two Tsuen Fu Handicap (1,800m) was the icing on the cake and came at the perfect time for Yeung.\n\n\u201cIt makes a good point to show people that after losing the two-pound claim I am still competitive. It\u2019s a meaningful win for me,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter settling midfield, Yeung decided to ride for luck at the turn and sneaked along the rail before easing around the leaders and taking control in the final 300m to defeat Tianchi Monster by half a length.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always had the ability, he\u2019s just difficult,\u201d Yeung said. \u201cEven today, I had Joao in front of me [on Star Performance] and there was a tiny gap and Joao was closing up.\n\n\u201cWhen I went for that gap, he wanted to do it and he was aggressive. He wanted to squeeze through that gap and go past Joao but as soon as he was leading and had nothing next to him, he started thinking and you could just feel him start looking around.\u201d\n\nForgotten Generation?\n\nBeauty Generation is rightfully feted as one of the greatest horses to have ever graced Hong Kong, but it appears his achievements have slipped the minds of some.\n\nBritish media outlet Thoroughbred Racing Commentary published a list of the 40 highest-earning gallopers of all time, but somehow John Moore\u2019s superstar missed out.\n\nMighty Australian mare Winx leads the way with about \u00a314 million (HK$139 million), ahead of Arrogate and Thunder Snow, while Beauty Generation should have slotted in 14th with about \u00a38.6 million, but was somehow left off the list.\n\nThey didn\u2019t forget Hong Kong\u2019s previous leading prize money earner though with Viva Pataca coming in 30th with just under \u00a36 million pounds. (The exercise was done using the exchange rate at the time).\n\nThe world\u2019s all-time highest-earning Thoroughbred racehorses: where is #Enable now?\n\n\n\nThe \u00a31 million-plus she earned for finishing second has pushed her career earnings past the \u00a310 million mark.\n\n\n\nFull list https://t.co/GqHdyDeExL pic.twitter.com/hEuYr9vPgL \u2014 TRC (@TRCommentary) October 11, 2019\n\nSpeaking of Beauty Generation, one group who is well aware of his capabilities is the Longines World\u2019s Best Racehorse Rankings panel.\n\nThe seven-year-old is now ranked number four overall with a rating of 127, earning that mark for his dominant first-up win in the Group Three Celebration Cup on October 1. It equals his previous best, which came in last year\u2019s Group One Hong Kong Mile.\n\nBeauty Generation is one point behind the three tied at the top \u2013 Enable, Crystal Ocean and last week\u2019s Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe winner Waldgeist.\n\nThat's five! 5\u20e3 What a day for Joao Moreira. Craig's Star claims the finale to give the Brazilian a fantastic five-timer! #HKracing pic.twitter.com/By8qNlDSbn \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 12, 2019\n\nWhat the bell is going on?\n\nAt the start of every race in Hong Kong, a bell will ring after the gates crash back to signify the event is underway.\n\nIt\u2019s a unique tradition that immediately grabs the attention of anyone who might have drifted off into their own world to remind them to focus again.\n\nBut for some reason there have been issues at Sha Tin recently.\n\nAt a previous meeting the bell wouldn\u2019t ring at all during some races but it went to another level on Saturday as it malfunctioned.\n\nIt sounded as if the bell was having a fit and continued long after it usually does. It was very odd, but you would expect it to be fixed pretty quickly.", "description": "He\u2019s seen in the heat of battle just how good Joao Moreira is and now Douglas Whyte is enjoying being able to sit back and admire the handiwork of the Magic Man from afar....", "authors": ["Sam Agars", "Tom Biddington", "Trenton Akers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/700x400/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/12/469c2570-ece6-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_220346.JPG?itok=K12DPC-G&v=1570889036", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
