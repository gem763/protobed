All the big talent to come through the ranks of domestic circuit have gone on to curve out successful international careers.\n\nIndia\u2019s domestic setup is better than most countries, but it has its own problems. While money rich Indian Premier League has glitz, glamour, astronomical TV deal, prolific marketing strategy, and audiences, the domestic leagues in India have anything but that.\n\nThe crowds have long stayed away from the domestic games, and it has happened even after the entry to the stadiums has been made free. The investment into the domestic cricket has been very measly, and it has been neglected because it doesn't generate the money on the lines of commercial leagues.\n\nAfter taking over, Sourav Ganguly said that giving domestic leagues their due was high on his agenda, and he needs to come good on his promise. He needs the invest in the domestic cricket and at the grassroots level programmes.\n\nThe circuit needs a revamp, and it could be the right time for Sourav Ganguly to change Indian cricket for the better.\n\nGive day-night Tests a go ahead\n\n@CricketAustralia\n\nAfter much deliberation and changes over the years to make Test cricket more interesting and compelling, the concept of day-night games was talked about as the game changer.\n\nWhile it is a ploy to get more people to the grounds, India has so far been very reluctant to take part in the day-night games. In a country like India where weather is so much of a factor, it should have been one of the first countries to have jumped at the opportunity and give it a go.\n\nNot only has that not happened, Indian team has outright been rejecting the prospect of adjusting to the change. But Sourav Ganguly has made it clear that the day-night Tests are the way forward, and he will have a prolonged discussion with the stakeholders to get the sign of approval.\n\nThe move will be massive, and also will positively impact the domestic cricket. The day-night Tests might also attract the people to the stadiums.\n\nGive BCCI a image makeover\n\nAFP\n\nIt goes without saying that world's richest cricket body that is the BCCI needs a massive image makeover.\n\nAfter being in the news for all the wrong reasons and all the questions asked about its credibility, Sourav Ganguly needs to change people's perspective about the BCCI. Internal conflicts, corruption, and indecisions, have made the board a laughing stock.\n\nPeople look at BCCI as a money minting company where few individuals earn tons of money for doing nothing. It is this outlook that Sourav Ganguly needs to change, and make the board a body that it is - of cricket and everything there in.", "description": "The dust has finally settled, after a long impasse and deliberations, Sourav Ganguly was unanimously chosen as the president-elect of the BCCI.
