He said he would give federal prosecutors until Monday to decide whether to intervene in the case, and until Wednesday to file an argument if they choose to do so.\n\nTrump is challenging the subpoena on the grounds that as president, he should be immune from any criminal prosecution or investigation.\n\nThe DA\u2019s office is seeking the documents from Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s accounting firm, as part of a probe into a payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels in advance of the 2016 election in exchange for her silence about her alleged affair with the president.\n\nAttorneys clashed in court Wednesday over whether the subpoena should be allowed to go forward.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer William Consovoy argued that a sitting president cannot be subject to a criminal investigation, whether state or federal.\n\n\u201cThis is a right the president holds and a privilege the president holds under the constitution,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFifty states cannot decide that they\u2019re going to investigate the president while he\u2019s trying to serve the country,\u201d he added. \u201cIf the court rules the district attorney can do this, then all fifty states can do this ... That is untenable.\u201d\n\nAssistant District Attorney Solomon Shinerock countered that the president would not be harmed if the DA\u2019s office gets its hands on his taxes, since the documents will be kept confidential as part of a grand jury investigation.\n\n\u201cTheir claims of harassment and bad faith are speculative and unfounded,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have no authority for the breathtaking grant of immunity that they seek.\u201d\n\nThe DA\u2019s office also argued that that a state court, not a federal court, should be the one to decide if the subpoena can proceed.", "description": "Trump sued last week to block Manhattan DA Cy Vance\u2019s subpoena.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b8/f8/62293c15428c85e28075544cc3c6/donald-trump.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
