No\u2014he was cornered by the greatest toughest best military heroes on earth!! How about we killed the evil SOB,' Hannity tweeted.\n\n'This is exactly why America will never trust these mainstream corrupt fake news outlets ever again.'\n\nIn another tweet he added: 'Let me educate the Washington Post. Al-Baghdadi was the leader of ISIS... The terror organization that is responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people. ISIS terrorists take pleasure in beheadings and burning people alive in cages. They use cars and trucks to mow down innocent people. To describe Al-Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar\" is sick and repulsive.'\n\nTwitter outrage at the misstep took off after Fox News anchor Sean Hannity (left) fired off a series of tweets blasting the headline as 'sick and repulsive'. Donald Trump Jr (pictured) also slammed The Post, tweeting that the outlet appeared to be 'in a race' with Bloomberg to see who 'can be the biggest ISIS sympathizers this week'\n\nDon Jr's tweet was referring to this Sunday morning tweet by Bloomberg Politics\n\nDon Jr also slammed The Post, writing that the outlet appeared to be 'in a race' with Bloomberg to see who 'can be the biggest ISIS sympathizers this week'.\n\n'Wow, @washingtonpost and Bloomberg (@bpolitics) are running neck in neck for the race to who can be the biggest ISIS sympathizers this week. Disgusting,' the president's son tweeted Sunday evening.\n\nDon Jr also quoted former White House communications aide Cliff Sims' tweet, which stated: 'Not to be outdone by @washingtonpost, Bloomberg takes the 'local boy makes good' angle.\n\nSims was referring to a multi-part Bloomberg Politics tweet, posted Sunday morning, which read: 'Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi transformed himself from a little-known teacher of Koranic recitation into the self-proclaimed ruler of an entity that covered swaths of Syria and Iraq.'\n\nPresident Trump announced Sunday morning that al-Baghdadi 'died like a dog' as the result of an overnight US Special Ops forces raid on his hideout in northwest Syria.\n\nTrump said that al-Baghdadi killed himself and three children when he detonated his suicide vest after being cornered in a dead-end tunnel.", "description": "The Washington Post's odd description of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi inspired critics to write parody headlines about the deaths of other notorious figures under the hashtag #WaPoDeathNotices.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20285732-0-image-a-29_1572279299337.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
