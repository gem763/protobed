(Al Drago/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department has come under increasing pressure in its investigation of the former deputy FBI director Andrew G. McCabe, as a federal judge threatened to release internal department records unless prosecutors decide whether to move forward with or abandon the politically charged case.\n\nJudge Reggie B. Walton of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is presiding over a lawsuit over FBI documents related to McCabe\u2019s firing last year, said at a hearing on Monday that he would soon begin releasing them. The Justice Department has argued that the materials should stay confidential while prosecutors investigate McCabe over whether he lied to internal investigators about dealings with the news media.\n\n\u201cYou all have got to cut and make your decision,\u201d Walton said, according to a transcript. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hard decision, and I think it needs to be made. If it\u2019s not made, I\u2019m going to start ordering the release of information because I think our society, our public, does have a right to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nMcCabe, long a target of President Donald Trump\u2019s, was the subject of a scathing report by the Justice Department inspector general\u2019s office that faulted him for violating media policy and repeatedly misleading its investigators. They were asking about an October 2016 Wall Street Journal article about an investigation into the Clinton Foundation. McCabe, working through the FBI press office, had authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak to a reporter to rebut allegations that he had slowed the inquiry.\n\nMcCabe was fired in March 2018, hours before retirement benefits would have kicked in, and the inspector general referred his findings to federal prosecutors in Washington a month later.\n\nWalton\u2019s stern warning came as prosecutors grappled with whether to bring charges in what is a seemingly straightforward case with a limited set of facts and witnesses that has been under investigation for 19 months.\n\n\u201cThis matter is a high-profile matter,\u201d Walton said. He added that as long as prosecutors hold off on deciding how to proceed, they \u201cundermine the credibility not only of the Justice Department because it\u2019s not making these hard decisions, but also the court.\u201d\n\nMcCabe\u2019s lawyers have argued that the case is weak and that he is being singled out because of the president\u2019s disdain for him. Trump has relentlessly attacked McCabe, potentially complicating any prosecution. McCabe has said the president targeted him to undermine his standing as a witness to whether he obstructed justice in the Russia inquiry.\n\nIn August, McCabe\u2019s lawyers met with Jeffrey A. Rosen, the deputy attorney general, to make a last-ditch appeal for prosecutors to drop the case. Their pleas were rebuffed, and an indictment appeared imminent. But the grand jury hearing the case reconvened last month after weeks without meeting but did not indict McCabe, raising questions about whether prosecutors delayed a vote by jurors to avoid a rare and embarrassing setback of their declining to hand up an indictment.\n\nOther setbacks have emerged for the government. One prosecutor on the case left the Justice Department and has said it lacked merit while another left on what seemed like the eve of a possible indictment.\n\nA key witness in the case \u2014 Lisa Page, the former FBI lawyer whom McCabe authorized to speak to the Wall Street Journal reporter \u2014 also told the grand jury that he was not motivated to lie about the episode because he was authorized to speak with reporters and thus did not violate media policy. Her sympathetic testimony to McCabe would most likely be a problem for prosecutors.\n\nAnother important witness who testified before the grand jury, Michael Kortan, the spokesman involved in the episode, could not immediately remember how the leak unfolded.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group, sued in July 2018 for the records related to McCabe\u2019s dismissal. The organization is seeking access to investigators\u2019 notes taken during Kortan\u2019s interview, which could be exculpatory to McCabe, the group\u2019s lawyer, Anne Weismann, argued during the hearing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in dark times,\u201d she told the judge, saying that growing evidence showed that Trump was abusing his powers to go after perceived enemies in the intelligence and law enforcement communities. McCabe, she said, was \u201cswept up in that.\u201d\n\nThe judge seemed to acknowledge her point, noting that Trump was \u201cgoing after the courts, too.\u201d He later added, \u201cI totally appreciate what you just said and share many of the same concerns that you have expressed.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has come under increasing pressure in its investigation of the former deputy FBI director Andrew G.
