The meatless meatballs will replace its grilled steak topping in its Keto Zoodle Bowl. The Beyond Meatballs will also be available for customers to add on to salads for $4.99 (for three), around 10 cents more than its Smokehouse Steak topping.\n\n\u201cWe see that plant-based is really the future,\u201d Janani Lee, Just Salad\u2019s chief sustainability officer, told FOX Business Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s something our guests are looking for.\u201d\n\nJust Salad is the latest chain to join the plant-based movement, following the likes of Burger King, White Castle, KFC, Del Taco and more.\n\nStill, some chains have been reluctant to add the fake meat to menus. Taco Bell announced a new vegetarian menu this week that didn\u2019t include an alternative to beef or chicken.\n\nChipotle has also been reluctant to jump on the alternative meat bandwagon. When asked if the chain would consider adding a plant-based meat to restaurants, Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol told Yahoo Finance in July: \u201cWe have spoken to those folks and, unfortunately, it wouldn\u2019t fit in our \u2018food with integrity\u2019 principals because of the processing, as I understand it, that it takes to make a plant taste like a burger.\u201d\n\nOther chains, like Arby\u2019s, known for its roast beef sandwiches, trolled the meatless movement, putting out a \u201cMarrot,\u201d a fake carrot made entirely out of meat, instead.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BYND BEYOND MEAT INC. 146.42 -2.20 -1.48%\n\nThe plant-based market has grown 11 percent in the past year, bringing the total plant-based market value to $4.5 billion, according to the Plant Based Foods Association.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nJust Salad sales are up 20% this year, and the company has averaged double-digit same store sales over the last three years, the chain told FOX Business.
