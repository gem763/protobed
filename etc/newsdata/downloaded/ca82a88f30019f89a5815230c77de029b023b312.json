Unlike frontrunners Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), he does not support for Medicare for All, but rather an alternative.\n\n\u201cI am a candidate who believes Medicare for All is not as attractive as Medicare for All Who Want It,\u201d Buttigieg said at The New Yorker Festival. \u201cBecause it gives people a choice.\u201d\n\nThrough Buttigieg\u2019s plan, everyone would automatically be involved in universal health care coverage for those who are eligible. It would also expand premium subsidies for low-income individuals, cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on Medicare, and limit what health care providers change for out-of-network care at double what Medicare pays for the same service. However, those who still want to stay on private insurance can do so.\n\nWhen asked whether or not this is a matter of \u201chaving your cake and eating it too,\u201d Buttigieg responded: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is how public alternatives work,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThey create a public alternative that the private sector is then forced to compete with.\u201d\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Indiana Pete Buttigieg prefers giving people a choice in health care.

Sanders has even gone so far as to call for the elimination of private insurance companies. Buttigieg, however, sees his plan as an opportunity for private insurance companies to step up.\n\n\u201cThe way I come at it is with a certain humility about what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cBecause one of two things will happen. Either, there\u2019s really no private option that\u2019s as good as the public one we\u2019re going to create \u2026 which means pretty soon everyone migrates to it and pretty soon it\u2019s Medicare for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr, some private plans are still better, in which case we\u2019re going to be really glad we didn\u2019t command the American people to abandon them whether they want to or not,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cI\u2019m neutral on which one of those outcomes happen.\u201d\n\nAccording to Politico, although there is no official cost for what Medicare for All Who Want It would cost, a campaign adviser said the federal spending would \u201cbe in the ballpark\u201d of $790 billion.\n\n\u201cThe core principle is not whether or not the government is your health insurance provider,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThe core principle for me is you get covered one way or the other. That\u2019s what Medicare for All Who Want It entails.\u201d\n\nAdriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
