About 150 migrants decided to return on foot.\n\nActivist Irineo Mujica of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, who accompanied the migrants, said only a small group opted to walk back on their own.\n\n\"The vast majority were taken to Tapachula, the caravan was dismantled,\" he said in a video documenting the incident.\n\nThe scene was reminiscent of a string of caravans that left Central America a year ago, at one point ballooning into a group of 7,000 people in southern Mexico.\n\nThat en masse migration drew extensive media attention and triggered a crisis with U.S. President Donald Trump, who called the caravans an \"invasion\" and demanded Mexico do more to halt their progress.\n\nThe Mexican government in June struck a deal with the United States vowing to significantly curb U.S.-bound migration in exchange for averting U.S. tariffs on Mexican exports.\n\nArrests at the U.S.-Mexico border fell in September for the fourth month in a row, after record high crossings this Spring, and the Trump administration credited cooperation from Mexico and Central American countries for the sustained drop.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jose Torres and Jacob Garcia in Huehuetan, Additional reporting by Daina Beth Solomon and Abraham Gonzalez in Mexico City; Editing by David Gregorio)", "description": "Mexico's military police on Saturday halted and turned back a caravan of up to 2,000 migrants from Africa, the Caribbean and Central America, hours after they embarked toward the United States, according to Reuters witnesses.
