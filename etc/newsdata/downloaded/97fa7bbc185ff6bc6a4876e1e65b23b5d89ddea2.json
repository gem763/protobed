They say suspended Greenville County Sheriff Will Lewis used his power to set up the encounter, first by hiring the woman at an inflated salary and then by setting up the trip and making excuses to get her alone.\n\nLewis is on trial this week in a Greenville County courtroom, charged with two counts of misconduct in office. No sexual assault charges have been filed. The assistant, Savanah Nabors, was paid nearly $100,000 from a state insurance fund in May to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit against Lewis, Greenville County and the sheriff's office.\n\nLewis faces up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted. The jury began deliberations Thursday evening.\n\nThe sheriff testified in his own defense Thursday, insisting several times that while his behavior was stupid, a violation of sheriff's office policy and perhaps even the kind of conduct for which he would fire an employee, it was not a crime. He said sex with the assistant was consensual; Nabors said it was not and wrote in a public blog about waking up to find him on top of her.\n\nProsecutors said Lewis, 43, hired the then-22-year-old Nabors to be his personal assistant after his 2016 election, paying her $62,000 a year in an agency where the starting salary for a deputy is around $30,000, to persuade her to have sex with him.\n\nLewis offered Nabors perks such as her own taxpayer funded vehicle and parking space, and let her into crime scenes, despite having no police training, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina has a broad misconduct law that allows prosecutors to pursue charges against any public officials who don't do their job properly. The prosecutors in Lewis' case said the sheriff misused county money to hire an unqualified person for an unnecessary position and that he used his power as sheriff to make Nabors fear for her job if she didn't do what he wanted.\n\nNabors had previously gone public with the details of what she called an unwanted sexual encounter with Lewis in 2017 in a Charlotte, North Carolina, hotel. She wrote in a blog that she woke up after drinks and the sheriff was on top of her and having sex.\n\nSolicitor Kevin Brackett ended his closing argument Thursday by holding up a sheriff's badge he pulled from his pocket.\n\n\"Nobody hates a dirty cop more than a good one because dirty cops like Will Lewis disgrace this badge,\" Brackett said as he asked jurors to hold Lewis accountable for abusing his power.\n\nLewis' lawyer Rauch Wise said it was unlikely that Nabors was intimidated given that she continued working for Lewis for months after their encounter. He added that having an affair is not illegal, even on a work trip.\n\n\"He had a one-night encounter with a subordinate in a hotel room that was paid for by the county. That is not a crime,\" Wise said. \"That is a moral failing.\"\n\nLewis' cross-examination Thursday was often testy, with the suspended sheriff vaguely answering yes-or-no questions and saying he was unable to recall events such as whether he went to Nabors' room the night after they had sex to apologize. She said he did \u2014 and then made another unwanted sexual advance.\n\n\"You're avoiding all the questions because you know if you answer the questions correctly you look guilty, because you are guilty, right?\" prosecutor Willy Thompson asked.\n\nLewis turned and looked directly at the jury. \"Unfortunately, I'm afraid that I'm not answering the questions the way that he wants to hear them answered, and that's the problem,\" he said.\n\nLewis testified that the sex with Nabors was spontaneous and started with her suddenly kissing him after he poured drinks in her hotel room.\n\nThompson alleged that Lewis planned the encounter carefully beforehand by pushing to have a budget retreat with county officials at an out-of-town hotel instead of in Greenville County; by bringing Nabors to the meetings even though she took no notes and hadn't been involved in drafting his new spending plans; and by making sure that a bottle of whiskey was in Nabors' bag so he could go to her room late at night.\n\n\"You set up everything perfectly so you would have the opportunity,\" Thompson asked Lewis.\n\n\"Things fell into line,\" Lewis responded. \"That was absolutely not a setup for anything.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
