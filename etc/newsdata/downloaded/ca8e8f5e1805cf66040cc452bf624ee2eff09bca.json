Samoa players look dejected after the match REUTERS/Edgar Su\n\nAfter a poor campaign in Pool A featuring only one win over emerging nation Russia, they depart with familiar regrets and a host of seemingly intractable problems.\n\nWhile Pacific neighbours Fiji and Tonga improved as their campaigns went on, Samoa went backwards after beating Russia, losing 38-19 to hosts Japan and bowing out on Saturday with a 47-5 thrashing by an Ireland team with 14 men for most of the match.\n\nWith New Zealander Steve Jackson as their third coach in as many years and a host of top players choosing club over country, Samoa were always going to be up against it.\n\nRecruitment has long been a battle and the island nation is increasingly stuck on the losing side.\n\nWhile boasting players of the calibre of captain Jack Lam and Bristol lock-loose forward Chris Vui, Jackson would have been thrilled to have had Worcester pair Michael Fatialofa and Melani Nanai and Leicester\u2019s Jordan Taufua at his disposal.\n\nInstead, they chose to eschew playing for a national team that can offer little more than pride in the jersey and the coverage of basic expenses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure players want to play for Samoa and we get a group of guys who want to come here,\u201d said Jackson after the Ireland defeat in Fukuoka.\n\n\u201cThey put the jersey before a piece of paper.\u201d\n\nUNDERWHELMING TOURNAMENT\n\nJackson, whose contract expires in November, put his hand up for an extension but may not get one after an underwhelming tournament in which his team lost 34-0 to Scotland, their first scoreless result in 30 World Cup matches.\n\nWhile lacking resources and depth, much of Samoa\u2019s travails in Japan were self-inflicted as they racked up the penalties and six yellow cards, twice that of the next most offending teams.\n\nJackson complained vociferously about the referees\u2019 lack of consistency, yet could not fix his team\u2019s propensity for going high in the tackle despite the clear hard line set early by administrators.\n\nTeam spirit and an underdog heart may have endeared them to local fans, but their defence and set pieces were often a shambles and much too easily exploited by the tier one teams.\n\nSamoa head into an uncertain future and, after finishing fourth in Pool A, will have to go through qualifying for the 2023 World Cup in France.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nA harder line on player releases from their clubs for France might help Samoa\u2019s cause but persuading young talent to stay at home rather than chasing contracts overseas is only likely to get tougher.\n\n\u201cThere is pressure coming from all angles on players trying to feed their families and put a roof over their heads,\u201d said Jackson.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult and I understand that. We can only focus on trying to develop them and capture those players early on.\u201d", "description": "Crippled by administrative chaos and a coaching merry-go-round through the World Cup cycle, Samoa arrived in Japan with an ambitious goal of reaching the knockout rounds.", "authors": ["Ian Ransom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191012&t=2&i=1440200653&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9B0PH", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
