REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger.\n\nFormer White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn and former White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter were subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee to appear at the hearing on possible obstruction of justice by Trump.\n\n\u201cThe President has directed Mr. Dearborn and Mr. Porter not to appear at the hearing,\u201d White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to the committee\u2019s chairman, Democrat Jerrold Nadler.\n\nCipollone said the Justice Department had determined that Dearborn and Porter \u201care absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters related to their service as senior advisers to the President.\u201d\n\nCipollone said former Trump campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, who was also subpoenaed to appear at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, could testify but not about conversations with Trump after he became president or with his senior advisers.\n\nNadler denounced the White House move as a \u201cshocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders,\u201d Nadler said in a statement, referring to Trump.\n\nDemocrats want to question the three men about an episode described by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in which Trump allegedly tried to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to redirect the Russia probe away from his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nThe episode is among a number of incidents contained in Mueller\u2019s 448-page report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election campaign that Democrats view as evidence Trump obstructed justice.\n\nLast week, the Democratic-led House panel adopted a resolution allowing it to designate hearings as impeachment proceedings, subject witnesses to more aggressive questioning and quicken the pace of its investigation of Trump.\n\nDemocrats aim to decide by the end of the year whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump to the full House. If approved by the chamber, the Republican-controlled Senate would be left to hold a trial and consider the president\u2019s ouster.", "description": "President Donald Trump has ordered two former White House aides not to testify at a House of Representatives committee hearing on Tuesday as the panel considers whether to recommend impeaching Trump.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430657393&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G02L", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
