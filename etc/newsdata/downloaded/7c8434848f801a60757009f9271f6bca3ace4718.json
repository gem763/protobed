The non-stop bombardment of information and indulgences that is modern life has transformed us into needy, pleasure-addicted thrillseekers! That\u2019s the conceit the proponents of \u201cdopamine fasting\u201d are running with, at least. Richard, a full-time life coach who runs a YouTube channel called ImprovementPill, posted an instructional video on dopamine fasting in November 2018 that has garnered almost 1.7 million views. \u201cI came up with the concept when I was in a rut,\u201d Richard told VICE.\n\nSome blog posts have credited him as the inventor of the practice, but Richard says he first heard the term \u201cdopamine fasting\u201d floating around self-improvement internet forums a few years ago, and remembered it again as a college student who felt drained and lethargic from partying and slacking off watching Netflix and neglecting healthier habits\u2014doing \u201cnothing,\u201d in his words. \u201cI was like, what if I just doubled-down on doing nothing and just did a lot of nothing for a whole day, I wonder what that\u2019s gonna do?\u201d\n\nA dopamine fast is the supposed antidote for the inattentiveness that plagues us, the burnout induced by too much of too many good things. It consists of a period of abstention from earthy delights like sex, drugs, and, in some extreme cases, talking to other people, for 24 hours or more. The desired end result is a neurochemical \u201creset\u201d\u2014a brain decluttered, procrastination banished, focus sharpened. If the idea of abstaining from anything fun in order to increase your mental clarity is appealing, congratulations: You and the notorious biohackers in Silicon Valley are on the same wave.\n\nBefore we get too far into it, it\u2019s best to know that dopamine fasting probably doesn\u2019t really have a lot to do with dopamine\u2014definitely not enough to merit the moniker, according to researchers familiar with the neurotransmitter. MEL Magazine\u2019s report on dopamine fasting compared the practice to meditation, specifically \u201cVipassan\u0101 meditation,\u201d and one faster they interviewed told them dopamine fasting was a reaction to our present-day understanding of the brain (\u201cA lot of the concepts have been used for a very long time, but in the modern era we understand neurology\u201d), though probably an overextended one.\n\n\u201cMy main problem is this: If someone wants to demonstrate that this is an effective therapy, then they should not just offer it as \u2018effective\u2019 on the internet, and start a fad in California,\u201d John Salamone, a psychology professor at the University of Connecticut, told VICE via email. \u201cI feel that it is misleading to call this \u2018dopamine fasting,\u2019 as if dopamine was the only thing being affected.\u201d\n\nSalamone also emphasized that the idea that dopamine equals pleasure is a pretty serious oversimplification. \u201cDopamine is involved in many functions, including motivation, emotion, learning, and reinforcement. The role in mood is complicated, so dopamine is not just a \u2018pleasure chemical,\u2019\u201d Salamone said. \u201cPeople often attribute the pleasure induced by food or drugs to dopamine, [but] there is evidence indicating that interfering with dopamine transmission does not alter hedonic reactivity to food, and that dopamine antagonist drugs do not consistently block the subjectively rated euphoria induced by drugs of abuse.\u201d\n\nBut beyond the misnomer, health and media psychologist Nancy Mramor said she could imagine the kind of break a dopamine fast entails being useful\u2014though a little more rigorous than the average person needs. \u201cNormally, a person is not overly concerned with all of these things at once, but is more over-indulgent in one or two,\u201d she told VICE. \u201cFor example, a measured amount of TV watching, reading, or coffee drinking can fit into a balanced life. But if something like reading has become a way of escaping from life, responsibility, and human interaction, then it would be wise to take a break.\u201d\n\nMramor said that a mental health professional would be more likely to recommend a tiered approach than a leap to total abstinence. \u201cOften, a person needs to take a break from something in order to get in perspective, gradually reintroducing it into their life until it reaches an agreed upon level and staying there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the individual is in therapy, the client and therapist could work together to establish a good level of use.\u201d\n\nA viral article posted on LinkedIn by University of California San Francisco assistant clinical psychiatry professor and \u201cexecutive psychologist\u201d Cameron Sepah put dopamine fasting back on the radar in early August. The post linked the practice to Silicon Valley, dubbing it the \u201chot trend\u201d akin to intermittent fasting. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear what the long-term implications of this overstimulation are on our brains, but in my private practice working with executive clients, I have observed that this interferes with our ability to sustain attention, regulate our emotions in non-avoidant ways, and enjoy simple tasks that seem boring by comparison,\u201d Sepah wrote. \u201cWe may be getting too much of a good thing, especially when dopamine reinforces behaviors that are out of line with our values.\u201d He also links dopamine release to addiction: \u201cEven behaviors such as gaming or gambling can become problematic and addictive through the reinforcement that dopamine brings.\u201d MEL spoke to Sepah, who admitted the term \u201cdopamine fasting\u201d was more about provoking a reaction than maintaining accuracy. \u201cThe term is technically incorrect, but \u2018stimulus control 101 for dealing with addictive behavior\u2019 just doesn\u2019t have the same ring to it,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Jaime Castrellon, whose research on dopamine\u2019s impact on value computation and self-control has been published in the Journal of Neuroscience, took issue with the language in Sepah\u2019s dopamine fast article equating pleasure-seeking with addiction.\n\n\u201cEngaging in everyday activities is typically normal and should not be compared to substance or behavioral addictions,\u201d Castrellon said over email. \u201cGenerally, higher levels of dopamine has been linked to positive feelings like excitement and \u2018wanting\u2019 to engage in something pleasurable. These feelings support learning positive outcomes from past decisions and keep us motivated for future ones.\u201d\n\nSepah\u2019s article states that dopamine fasting is not a one-size-fits-all practice, because not everyone derives pleasure from the same stimuli. But he suggests a few basics for fasters to cut out: sex, internet use, shopping, pleasure eating, thrill-seeking, and recreational drugs.\n\nRichard\u2019s dopamine fasting approach is more restrictive: He cuts out all activities besides writing, taking walks, and drinking water. The YouTuber said that although he\u2019s only dopamine fasted three times in his life, it\u2019s been a restorative experience every time. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a reset button,\u201d Richard said. The day after a dopamine fast, he said, his motivation is always sharper than before. \u201cYou end up doing all the things you \u2018should\u2019 be doing. Since you just spent a whole day doing nothing, anything sounds fun.\u201d\n\nCastrellon said temporary abstinence may not affect dopamine levels, especially if you\u2019re taking time off from fun by staying home all day, in familiar territory. \u201cWe would still expect to see dopamine release in response to cues in the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t turn on Netflix when you get home, but just seeing the TV itself triggers dopamine to release because it\u2019s been associated with watching Netflix.\u201d\n\nCastrellon did add that if dopamine fasting were to impact the brain\u2019s levels of the neurotransmitter, it could have a \u201creset\u201d effect, just not the same one Richard described feeling. \u201cIf abstaining from everyday pleasurable activities and goods did have an effect, we would actually expect the brain to re-calibrate and become more sensitive to whatever rewards you\u2019re still getting\u2014like water or plain food, since those would now be the only thing left to give you pleasure,\u201d he said. But, due in part to the fact that everyone has different brain chemistry, there\u2019s no formal research on this subject in particular; so far, we\u2019ve only got lifestyle bro pseudo-trip diaries to work off of.\n\nFrom a mental health perspective, Mramor said a dopamine fast could also be a useful tool for gaining perspective on your habits and establishing boundaries with yourself. \u201cAnyone taking a break will begin to notice the many times a day they indulged (\u2018I would have been eating junk food right now,\u2019 or \u2018I would have had my phone on all night\u2019), raising conscious awareness of their behavior and the destructive level of it,\u201d she said. Of course, this leaves open the possibility of extreme abstinence. I\u2019d say it\u2019s only a matter of time before we hear about someone heading out into the desert to forgo fun permanently, but they since they\u2019d have sworn off posting forever, we\u2019d never even know about it.\n\nRichard, for his part, acknowledged that dopamine fasting\u2019s benefits could absolutely be rooted in the placebo effect, but still encouraged anyone considering it to give it a try. \u201cThere\u2019s really no risk\u2014it\u2019s not like a change in diet, or some sort of medication or supplement,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter you do it, you\u2019ll know whether or not it works. You can\u2019t really get hurt from doing nothing.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Katie Way on Twitter .", "description": "If everyone in Silicon Valley was taking a day-long vow of silence and forgoing fun, would you do it too?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da8a0767dc312000af9ad5e/lede/1571333590190-ARC_Shutterstock_197065211_Man_staring_at_phone_blue_light_studio_VICE_RF.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.7956xh;0xw,0.0637xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
