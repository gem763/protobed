Photo: HBO\n\nOn Sunday night, a now-immortal Succession phrase entered the lexicon: \u201cYou can\u2019t make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs.\u201d It\u2019s an essential truth of its own, though of course it specifically refers to a series of emails that Tom Wambsgans sent to Cousin Greg(ory) that come up during congressional hearings about Waystar Royco\u2019s shady cruise operations. According to Senator Gil Eavis, Tom sent this subject line 67 times in one evening, and though we don\u2019t see the emails written out onscreen, HBO\u2019s captions spell out the line \u201cYou can\u2019t make a Tomlette without breaking some Greggs.\u201d\n\nThis raised some questions for me. For one, of all the possible ways to spell \u201cTomlette,\u201d why go that way? Why not Tomelette, or even Tomelet? An omlette, after all, isn\u2019t a thing. Secondarily, I agree with the spelling of \u201cGreggs,\u201d a fitting portmanteau of Greg, an egglike person, and egg, a Greg-like food. But why not simply \u201cGregs?\u201d And if this is just what Gil was saying, what was Tom\u2019s own spelling? Did he vary it across 67 emails?\n\nnot the spelling *I* would go for, HBO captions writer, but sure pic.twitter.com/mADGW0wVpJ \u2014 Jackson McHenry (@McHenryJD) October 7, 2019\n\nIn a quest for understanding on this point, I had to do some research. New York\u2019s style guide* prefers \u201comelet,\u201d which would therefore render the words \u201cGreggs\u201d and \u201cTomelet,\u201d though I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of the second. So, I also reached out to HBO, which confirmed with an inside source that the proper spelling is indeed \u201cTomelette\u201d and \u201cGreggs,\u201d to match the spellings \u201comelette\u201d and \u201ceggs.\u201d\n\nThere you go: You can\u2019t make \u201cTomelette\u201d without adding that first \u201ce,\u201d something Tom himself apparently needs to get a handle on.\n\n*The initial version of this post said New York\u2019s house style was \u201comelette.\u201d This is incorrect, and I apologize for breakfast-related error.", "description": "According to Tom Wambsgans on \u201cSuccession,\u201d you can\u2019t make a Tomelette without breaking some Greggs, but how do you spell those words?", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/08/08-tom-succession.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
