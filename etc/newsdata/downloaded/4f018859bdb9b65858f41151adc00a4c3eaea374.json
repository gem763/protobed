They're more important now, so they're going to take a little more time,\" former manager Jim Leyland said as Houston took batting practice Saturday.\n\n\"But there's no question about it, they're dragging on a little too long,\" he said.\n\nThere are reasons, sure.\n\nThe break between half-innings is now 2 minutes, 55 seconds, up from the 2:05 for most regular-season games.\n\nAlex Bregman, Juan Soto and the hitters want more time outside the batter's box to get steady. Josh James, Fernando Rodney and the relievers need an extra moment or two to compose themselves. Plus, those non-stop pitching changes.\n\nLooming is the possibility of record-low television ratings as fans either tune away or nod off.\n\nEven at Nationals Park and Minute Maid Park, there have been plenty of empty seats at the end.\n\nIt wasn't always like this. Not even recently.\n\nIn 2017, nine-inning World Series games between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Astros averaged 3:16. Last year, the matchups between the Boston Red Sox and LA took 3:30 (and didn't include the 18-inning affair at Dodger Stadium that lasted 7:20).\n\nOn Friday night, the Astros beat Washington 4-1 in a pretty straightforward game. Yet it still took 4:03 and ended a few minutes past midnight.\n\n\"I know a lot of it has to do with TV, commercials and things of that nature. We've got a 3-minute in between,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \"So it is what it is.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, I said this before, I can't drink caffeine anymore. But a couple cups of coffee would have done wonders for me during the game yesterday,\" he said.\n\nMartinez used to drink six cups of coffee a day before having a cardiac catheterization in September.\n\nThis season, Major League Baseball said the average time of a nine-inning game reached a record 3 hours, 5 minutes, 35 seconds. That exceeded the 3:05:11 in 2017.\n\nThe average was cut to 3:00:44 in 2018, aided by new rules that trimmed mound visits without pitching changes. It was 2:46 in 2005.\n\nBaseball tried a speedup at spring training, experimenting with a 20-second pitch clock. Nationals ace Max Scherzer was among many players who didn't like it.\n\nMLB is allowed to implement a pitch clock next season \u2014 the minor leagues already have them \u2014 but Commissioner Rob Manfred is reluctant to do that without support from all sides. Manfred plans to discuss the issue at an owners' meeting next month.\n\nMeanwhile, Game 4 slowed to a crawl in the late innings as the Astros pulled away for an 8-1 win.\n\nTough night for the Nats, and for the fans.\n\n\"When I was a kid and grew up and was a Pirates fan, games would take 2 hours, a long game was 2 1/2,\" Batwinis said.\n\nJoining him was Ed Shirley, a fellow former teacher also in his 70s. He grew up in Maryland rooting for the Washington Senators and flew from Florida this weekend to see his first World Series game in person.\n\nNowadays, Shirley likes to wake up early to play golf. Meaning not much sleep on World Series nights.\n\n\"You can't watch it all,\" he said. \"It's too long.\"\n\nFor the record, Trea Turner grounded out to end this game. The stadium clock showed 11:57 p.m.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
