From Ukraine to Turkey to Iran to Foggy Bottom, Giuliani has left his mark. Who cares if Mike Pompeo now sits in the same office once occupied by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d has emerged as the Zelig of the Trump presidency, appearing anywhere and everywhere, the only thing missing being feathers sprouting from his head. As to whether Giuliani has truly served the presidency\u2019s true interests, as opposed to simply playing Trump\u2019s TV lawyer, that\u2019s a whole other story.\n\nRelated: Rudy Giuliani's quest for dirt on Biden via Ukraine \u2013 a timeline\n\nOn Thursday, the justice department charged Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two of Giuliani\u2019s clients who are embroiled in Ukraine and the hunt for Hunter Biden, with felony campaign finance violations and conspiracy.\n\nFor good measure, the trio, Giuliani, Parnas and Fruman, have already announced that they would refuse to cooperate with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Apparently, Giuliani\u2019s grasp has finally exceeded his reach.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t end there. On Wednesday Bloomberg reported that Trump had pressed Rex Tillerson, who at the time was nominally secretary of state, to push the justice department into killing an investigation into Reza Zarrab, a Giuliani client, for allegedly violating sanctions designed to thwart Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Specifically, in a February 2017 Oval Office meeting, Trump had invited Giuliani, and Michael Mukasey, Bush 43\u2019s attorney general and a former federal judge, to lobby Tillerson on that score.\n\nUltimately, Tillerson declined to lend a hand, Giuliani would fill our television screens, Zarrab would be prosecuted and convicted, and Mukasey\u2019s son, Marc, would come to represent Trump in his bids to keep his tax returns shrouded. There was something for everyone \u2013 think family business.\n\nWay back when, Mukasey had served as a mentor to Giuliani, and at the 2016 Republican convention, Mukasey had trashed Hillary Clinton \u2013 after first playing never-Trumper: \u201cFor a hint of why a Donald Trump presidency would imperil our national security \u2026\u201d Not any more, time flies.\n\nAlong with supreme court justice, secretary of state was the job Rudy coveted, and it was the job Trump wanted to give him but didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t, according to Michael Wolff\u2019s 2018 blockbuster, Fire & Fury: \u201cThe resistance to Giuliani from the Trump circle derived from the same reason Trump was inclined to give him the job \u2013 Giuliani had Trump\u2019s ear and wouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Wolff volunteered: \u201cThere were also whispers from the staff \u2018about his health and stability.\u2019\u201d To be sure, they were the same whispers that were echoed at a pre-inaugural lunch held at a Manhattan steakhouse by veterans of Giuliani\u2019s time at city hall, and those with significant ties to the current administration.\n\nMore than once Giuliani\u2019s antics have left Trump\u2019s backers with a sense of agita. Last month, as the winds of impeachment began to blow strong, Giuliani did an about-face on cable in a matter of moments. After saying that he didn\u2019t ask Ukraine to investigate Biden, Giuliani quickly reversed course and told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that he actually had.\n\nLike Trump, Giuliani can engender a sense of disappointment and disgust among those who know him best\n\nJust days later, a letter accompanying a congressional subpoena to Giuliani used his own words against him: \u201cFor example, on September 19, 2019, you admitted on national television that you personally asked the government of Ukraine to target Vice President Biden. During an interview on CNN, Chris Cuomo asked you, \u201cSo, you did ask Ukraine to look into Joe Biden?\u2019 You responded, \u2018Of course I did.\u2019\u201d\n\nLike Trump, Giuliani can engender a sense of disappointment and disgust among those who know him best. Ken Frydman, a New York-based public relations whiz and a veteran of Giuliani\u2019s 1993 mayoral race, recently wrote: \u201cThe man I worked for in 1993 is not the man who now lies for Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nFrydman isn\u2019t alone. As another Giuliani alumnus told the Guardian, \u201cThere is tremendous disappointment that a man we once greatly admired and who was worthy of that admiration has become a lapdog to a conspiracy theorist president.\u201d The aide explained: \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking in so many ways because \u2013 at his core \u2013 for better or worse, Rudy was always his own man. Sadly, he no longer is.\u201d", "description": "Giuliani wanted to be tapped as America\u2019s top diplomat, and it looks like he got more than he bargained for: congressional scrutiny and the media\u2019s glare\u2018Giuliani is learning, as others have before, there is no brass ring when it comes to Trump.\u2019 Photograph: Charles Krupa/APFrom the looks of things,", "authors": ["Lloyd Green"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hh33GMJ6mXDZonkkryaDCg--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00OTk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/022a7704d1a4ef765a876c6a5d484c0d", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
