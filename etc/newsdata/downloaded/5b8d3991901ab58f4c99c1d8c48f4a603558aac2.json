Feel free to spread the word! https://t.co/gg3eGRxFls \u2014 terry diebold (@terry51d) October 2, 2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack when owner Terry Diebold first revealed he\u2019d found the console in a box of \u2018junk\u2019 there were questions as to whether it was a fake or not, but it now seems to have been accepted as real.\n\nAfter owning the console for several years Diebold is now looking to sell the hardware to the highest bidder. No price has been mentioned but it could end up being one of the most expensive video game purchases of all time.\n\nUsually hardware isn\u2019t rare enough to break any records and the most expensive items tend to be rare 8-bit games, such as obscure NES title Stadium Events, which was once listed on eBay for $100,099.99 (\u00a389,000).\n\nIt\u2019s not always an obscure game that sells that much though. Only a few years ago someone paid \u00a323,000 for a mint copy of a first edition Super Mario Bros., one of the most successful and widely produced video games of all time.\n\nEven with those price comparisons it\u2019s still impossible to guess what the Nintendo PlayStation could go for but if it doesn\u2019t involve a Guinness World Record we\u2019d be very surprised.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "The only known prototype of the SNES CD-ROM is up for auction, with talk of it breaking records for the most paid for a video game antique.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EFziRAdXoAgpyyz-9697_1570446824.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
