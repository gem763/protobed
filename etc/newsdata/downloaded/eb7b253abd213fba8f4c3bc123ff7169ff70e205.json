It\u2019s one of just three houses in a cul-de-sac off Wolseley Rd, Australia\u2019s most expensive street.\n\nAussie John Symond owns the house next door. He realised he couldn\u2019t let go of his two years ago, even for $100 million.\n\nMORE: No sign of a late spring surge of listings\n\nHis block is bigger, but Ms Cooke\u2019s house is an architectural masterpiece.\n\nIn 2006, 17 years after she made that promise to herself, Ms Cooke snapped up the Wingdal Pl site at a foreclosure auction for $7.95 million.\n\n\u201cIt was like I\u2019d won the lottery \u2026 I thought it had incredible potential,\u201d Ms Cooke said, turning to old friends from her Sydney University days, Jonathan Temple and James Stockwell for the original design for an energy efficient house which opens up to provide airy living spaces on all levels.\n\nThe project was further developed and construction was supervised by award-winning architects Huw Turner and Penny Collins.\n\nThe secret to the completed home is the selection of natural materials.\n\nMs Cooke personally chose the reclaimed Karri wood. Sandstone came from Wondabyne on the Central Coast and marble from the family\u2019s own quarries in southern Europe.\n\nThe one-of-a-kind woven vaulted copper ceiling on the top level was Mr Turner\u2019s idea, who says: \u201cWe wanted to bring a combination of classic materials that while contemporary provide a sense of drama, warmth and permanence.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also an automated Panoramah! window system from Italy. \u201cThese windows maximise the benefits of cross-ventilation and \u2018disappear\u2019 into the walls when fully open. It\u2019s an understated, simple touch yet dramatically frames some amazing views,\u201d Mr Turner says.\n\nThere\u2019s an infinity pool lined in Cait Rosso red marble from Europe which tones in exactly with the copper clad roof of the poolside studio and shower room.\n\nOther eco features include photo voltaic panels, a grey water recycling system; solar hydronic heating in the bathrooms.\n\nThe home has custom LED lighting by designer Tim Barry, manufactured in Australia by Opal Lighting.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to be able to be converted into up to three apartments in the future.\n\nThe garden design was by landscape architect Craig Burton, and executed by a team from Growability at the Windgap Foundation, a charity for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nSubject to council approval, there\u2019s space for a private slipway on the waterfront.\n\nMr Hogan said: \u201cWe are expecting a significant degree of interest in this special home both locally and internationally.\u201d", "description": "Take an exclusive tour of environmental lawyer Sarah Cooke\u2019s $60 million Point Piper mansion, which may smash all records at auction.", "authors": ["Stephen Nicholls"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/09000425/capi_9fbfd8047cce68a64c94771a38033522_afd8e8fc5fc86bb78e030193d21e312c.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
