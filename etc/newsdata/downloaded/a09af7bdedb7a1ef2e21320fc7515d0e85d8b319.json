The Yankees would then host Game 5 on Friday, and Game 6 would be played Saturday, if necessary, in Houston. A delay would seemingly hurt the Yankees more than the Astros.\n\n\u201cObviously if that were to happen, that changes some things moving forward as far as our rotation potentially moving guys up,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWhat it could mean for the starting rotations\n\nA potential rainout would allow both teams to delay when they employ a bullpen game and instead use starting pitchers for at least the next two games.\n\nIf there\u2019s no postponement, both teams are set to match their bullpens Wednesday, with the Yankees likely starting Chad Green \u2013 who has not yet been told he\u2019s starting as of Tuesday night \u2014 and the Astros expecting to lean on Jose Urquidy, although he might not start.\n\nGerrit Cole could pitch on short rest on Saturday in Houston in ALCS Game 6. (Mike Stobe/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThis is the ALCS, it would be very unique for one team, let alone two teams to throw that many pitchers, that would be expected in that setting,\u201d Astros manager A.J. Hinch said before a 4-1 victory in Game 3 gave Houston a 2-1 series lead. \u201cI may say I'm doing a bullpen game, and Urquidy goes out there at some point during the game and I give him five or six innings. I'm not sure that would really apply. The same I hope is I wouldn't have to use nine pitchers. That's not often ideal, because what if the game goes 10, 11, 12, 13 innings. Unexpected things happen in regular games let alone bullpen games.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIf there\u2019s a rainout, Boone said there\u2019s a \u201cgood chance\u201d the Yankees would turn to Game 1 starter Masahiro Tanaka on Thursday, who would be on regular rest. The Astros could again counter with their Game 1 starter, Zack Greinke.\n\nBoth teams could then go to their Game 2 starters on Friday since James Paxton and Justin Verlander would be on regular rest.\n\nThat would then line up both teams for a bullpen game Saturday barring Gerrit Cole and Luis Severino returning on short rest for Game 6. The team that is trailing would be more inclined to delay a bullpen game another day.\n\n\u201cBullpen days are effective,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThat's been kind of proven as baseball has evolved throughout this season, last season, a couple of teams made really impressive transitions as you can do that and you can optimize your pitching that way. It's also scary and dangerous as a manager. There's a lot of pressure. You're asking a lot of guys to be really good that day. And when the game changes or the game gets long or something unforeseen happens, a move gets made on the other side, it gets a little bit more difficult to manage perfectly in that game.\u201d\n\nChad Green could start for the New York Yankees on Wednesday if Game 4 of the ALCS isn't rained out. (Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports)\n\nNo off days for the relievers\n\nWhile a rainout would have a much greater effect on the rotations, it would put the Yankees in a situation in which they may have to push their relievers more than they have all year.\n\nThe Yankees avoided using relievers three straight days during the regular season, but a rainout would leave the Yankees needing to win three games in four days.\n\nThere\u2019s no chance the Yankees would not use an elite reliever like Aroldis Chapman or Zack Britton for a third or fourth straight day in the postseason, but it would be asking them to go beyond what they did during the regular season.\n\nIt may not matter, but it could.\n\n\u201cYou know you might have to pitch in every game, but it\u2019s something this time of year you just do it,\u201d Green said. \u201cYou try not to overthink it. You just go out there.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees also lean on their bullpen much more compared to the Astros who ride their starters deep into games, and that would only intensify the burden on the relievers. Boone has already shown that he has a short leash with Paxton, and Luis Severino has only lasted five innings in one of his eight postseason starts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need some length,\u201d Boone said. \u201cConfident our starters can give us that. Obviously one of these days we\u2019ll kind of bullpen it and have to go that way. But I\u2019m confident [the starting pitchers] can [get] us deeper into the game.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "While a rainout would have a much greater effect on the rotations, it would put the Yankees in a situation in which they may have to push their relievers more than they have all year.", "authors": ["Matt Ehalt"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0ZLtHOcCs.FQWkFIeGB47g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jnDx2gEWGSFYyhW_oiExdg--~B/aD0yMTgzO3c9MzI3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7d185b80-efb8-11e9-bf7c-45fec358e49b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
