Alongside the hard line on Brexit, the questions showcased Johnson and Cummings' wider agenda, centered on issues Downing Street believes represent the public's own priorities: preventing violent crime, supporting the National Health Service, improving internet coverage nationwide.\n\nThough a People's PMQs has all the hallmarks of a Cummings tactic, it is not an especially new idea for leaders seeking to portray themselves as benevolent champions of the people: just ask Vladimir Putin, whose annual phone-ins have been known to last for four hours.\n\nJohnson \u2014 who dealt with the public for a mere 10 minutes \u2014 has some catching up to do, but we are promised more editions soon.\n\nAfter fielding further tough questions, some of which bore a remarkable and no doubt entirely coincidental resemblance to Downing Street talking points \u2014 \"What will you do to restore the British people's faith in politics and politicians?\" \"What efforts will you take to ensure your government represents and hears the voices of all British people across the country?\" \u2014 Johnson responded to Oliver who wanted to know who the prime minister's political hero is.\n\n\"Pericles will go down as one of the most powerful articulators of the idea of democracy, which is that the people are ultimately in charge of their own destiny\" \u2014 Boris Johnson\n\nJohnson has answered this one several times before, and while mentioning Winston Churchill as one hero, he leaped into an oration on Pericles of Athens.\n\n\u201cPericles of Athens, who believed in all sorts of wonderful things \u2026 he certainly believed in great infrastructure projects, he believed in the importance of the many not the few, but above all Pericles will go down as one of the most powerful articulators of the idea of democracy, which is that the people are ultimately in charge of their own destiny,\" he said.\n\nThe idea that Pericles, who has been dead for more than 2,400 years, \"will go down\" in history as a champion of democracy might have struck some listeners as an odd way to put it. But perhaps Johnson had someone else in mind.", "description": "UK prime minister takes to social media to answer questions from the masses.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Isabella Borshoff", "Will Hanmer-Lloyd"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1161230601-1-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-14"}
