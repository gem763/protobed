He was 70.\n\nThe cause was complications of renal cancer, said Carol Ann Cheung, a publicist with his music publisher, Boosey & Hawkes. Dr. Rouse\u2019s final work, Symphony No. 6, is scheduled to premiere Oct. 18 with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and conductor Louis Langr\u00e9e.\n\nAs recently as last week, Dr. Rouse was still polishing the score, according to his friend Joel Puckett, a composer who taught alongside Dr. Rouse at the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cEven at the very end, he was assessing the moves and structures and tricks he\u2019s used before, still trying to find new ways to crack the nut,\u201d Puckett said.\n\nRare among modern composers for achieving both critical acclaim and popular success, Dr. Rouse wrote chamber and vocal works that were performed around the world and taught for more than two decades at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. But he was best known for his symphonies and concertos, which featured a sound that cellist Yo-Yo Ma once described as \u201cspiritual without being sentimental, deeply felt without sentimentality.\u201d\n\nTrained in the 1960s and \u201970s, an era of heady experimentation in classical music, Dr. Rouse drew on the twelve-tone serialism taught by his professor Richard Hoffmann, the neoclassical principles of pianist Robert Palmer, the rigorous formalism of composer Karel Husa and the avant-garde instrumentation of his private instructor, George Crumb.\n\nBut he broke with many of his mentors and peers in his love for the Romantic tradition of composers such as Johannes Brahms and Dmitri Shostakovich, and for his use of electric guitars and rock motifs. He quoted the rock bands Jefferson Airplane and Moby Grape and made headlines for his eight-person percussion piece \u201cBonham\u201d (1988), written as an ode to Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham.\n\n\n\nDr. Rouse in 2007. (Jeffrey Herman)\n\nIn hard-rock fashion, some of his scores were so loud that fortissimo was said to be marked with six Fs, instead of the usual two. That boisterousness contributed to a 1985 incident in which a member of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, where Dr. Rouse was a composer in residence, filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, saying his music was too loud.\n\n\u201cTo me, loud dynamics have to do with expressive urgency,\u201d Dr. Rouse once told the Baltimore Sun. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is what music conveys and how it\u2019s meaningful to the human spirit. If one has something urgent to say, intense emotions are usually lined up with loud dynamics. Part of being a human being is a need to beat one\u2019s breast \u2014 to shout or scream.\u201d\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Rouse won the Pulitzer Prize in music for his Trombone Concerto, which he described as one of his \u201csofter\u201d pieces. When it premiered at the New York Philharmonic the previous year, some of the string musicians were seen putting their fingers in their ears onstage; New York Times music critic Edward Rothstein said he had \u201cnever heard the orchestra play louder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe trombone, an instrument typically associated with slides and energy and swing, with sudden moves and blasts, is here turned into an almost introspective isolate: lyrically mourning, then raging and mourning again,\u201d Rothstein wrote. The concerto featured \u201can element of risk,\u201d he added, \u201cas if something personal were being revealed. At its best, the music can seem a form of expressionist soul-baring.\u201d\n\nTrombone Concerto was dedicated to composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein, who died in 1990, and was the first of several major works by Dr. Rouse concerned with death. The theme had interested him since at least the age of 8, when his best friend hanged himself, according to the Sun. For a Cub Scout project that year, Dr. Rouse reportedly wrote that he would grow up to \u201cbe famous for a darkness of sickness\u201d and \u201cbe a great American composer.\u201d\n\n1 of 58 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2019.

In 1992, he completed his Violoncello Concerto, a memorial to the late composers William Schuman and Andrzej Panufnik.\n\n\u201cThe second movement is about the last nanosecond of life, the moment when you are no longer alive but not quite dead,\u201d he told the Boston Globe. \u201cIt is not a consoling piece,\u201d he added.\n\nEarning the ironic nickname \u201cMr. Sunshine,\u201d Dr. Rouse went on to write a Flute Concerto (1993) dedicated to murdered toddler James Bulger; Symphony No. 2 (1994), which featured an adagio in memory of composer Stephen Albert, who died in a car accident; and \u201cEnvoi\u201d (1995), an orchestral work dedicated to his late mother. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, he completed an apocalyptic, 90-minute Requiem (2002).\n\nBeginning in the mid-1990s, Dr. Rouse moved toward lighter material such as \u201cConcert de Gaud\u00ed,\u201d inspired by the phantasmagoric work of Spanish architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. Dr. Rouse won a Grammy Award after it was recorded by Sharon Isbin.\n\nHe also continued to focus on his teaching, offering one of the first music-school courses on rock history and advising young composers such as Kamran Ince and Nico Muhly to \u201cjust listen to everything,\u201d whether contemporary or canonical.\n\n\u201cIf he thought you were any good at all, he was going to tell you something horrible about your music,\u201d his colleague Puckett said by phone, recalling Dr. Rouse\u2019s tough-love approach. \u201cHe was also hard on himself. I asked him once, \u2018Do you have a favorite piece of yours?\u2019 He said, \u2018The Flute Concerto is almost good enough for me to be proud of.\u2019 And I\u2019ve listened to that piece maybe 1,000 times in the last 20 years. It\u2019s just heartbreakingly beautiful.\u201d\n\nChristopher Chapman Rouse III was born in Baltimore on Feb. 15, 1949. His father worked in sales at Pitney Bowes, the postage meter company. His mother was a secretary who introduced Chris to classical music, playing Beethoven\u2019s Fifth Symphony on the record player.\n\nHe soon decided to become a composer but never mastered an instrument, lasting six months on percussion. He also never wrote things down: For his application to the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio, he composed a piece he misleadingly titled Symphony No. 2, \u201cso that it would look like I\u2019d been busy.\u201d\n\nDr. Rouse graduated from Oberlin with a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1971 and received a doctorate in music from Cornell University in 1977. He began teaching at Eastman in 1981 and also taught at institutions including the Juilliard School in Manhattan and the Aspen Music Festival and School in Colorado.\n\nHis notable early compositions included \u201cBump\u201d (1985), an orchestral work that Dr. Rouse described as \u201cmy vision of a Boston Pops tour performance in hell,\u201d and Symphony No. 1, which won the 1988 Kennedy Center Friedheim Award for composing.\n\nDr. Rouse\u2019s marriage to Ann J. Rouse ended in divorce. In 2016, he married Natasha Miller, whose name he encoded into Symphony No. 3 using a system that assigned musical pitches to letters. In addition to his wife, of Baltimore, survivors include two children from his earlier marriage; three stepchildren; and two grandchildren.\n\nFor years, Dr. Rouse wrote primarily during the summer, when he wasn\u2019t teaching, seated at a card table in his Baltimore living room with little more than a No. 2 pencil and stack of music paper. As he had in his youth, he composed largely inside his own head, marshaling instruments he never learned to play.\n\n\u201cI do not write music just for myself, to provide a personal catharsis,\u201d he told the Globe in 1997. \u201cMusic is not about self-fulfillment. Instead, it is a communicative art. I deeply believe in the importance of the audience. Music, like the other arts, has the power to present something meaningful to people about human experience, about their own experiences. \u2026 Art has to be truthful, not just inspiring. It should always make you sit on the edge of your seat, make you want to live a little more vibrantly.\u201d", "description": "He wrote a tribute to Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham and was known for his emotionally powerful symphonies and concertos.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NEcjcZMWPhfL_CL5St_nFLl0_4w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4FUG2XG5L4I6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
