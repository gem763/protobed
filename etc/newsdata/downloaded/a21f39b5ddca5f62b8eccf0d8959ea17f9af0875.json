At one point in the conversation, Trump said, \u201cI would like for you to do us a favor.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s words set the parameters for the debate to come \u2014 just the fourth impeachment investigation of an American president in the nation\u2019s history. The initial response highlighted the deep divide between the two parties: Democrats said the call amounted to a \u201cshakedown\u201d of a foreign leader, while Trump \u2014 backed by the vast majority of Republicans \u2014 dismissed it as a \u201cnothing call.\u201d\n\nSee also: Trump defends \u2018nothing call\u2019 with Ukrainian president as White House summary shows he pushed for Biden inquiry\n\nThe call is one part of a whistleblower complaint on the president\u2019s activities. After being stymied by the administration, lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees will get their first look at the complaint on Wednesday. Congress is also seeking an in-person interview with the whistleblower, who remains anonymous.\n\nTrump spent the day meeting with world leaders at the United Nations, a remarkable split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump era. On his schedule: a meeting with Zelenskiy.\n\nIn light-hearted appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he didn\u2019t want to get involved in American elections, but added, \u201cNobody pushed me.\u201d Trump chimed in, \u201cIn other words, no pressure.\u201d\n\nThe next steps in the impeachment inquiry were still developing a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the probe. Moderate Democrats, including some from districts where Trump remains popular, urged the speaker to keep the inquiry to Ukraine and not expand into other issues Congress had already been investigating.\n\n\u201cWe need to be disciplined about how we communicate,\u201d said Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. \u201cThe minute we\u2019re talking about the intricacies of process is the minute that we are losing people.\u201d\n\nPelosi announced the impeachment probe on Tuesday after months of resistance to a process she has warned would be divisive for the country and risky for her party. But after viewing the transcript on Wednesday, Pelosi declared: Congress must act.\u201d\n\nTrump, who thrives on combat, has all but dared Democrats to move toward impeachment, confident that the specter of an investigation led by the opposition party will bolster rather than diminish his political support.\n\nSee also: Five points every investor ought to consider about the Trump impeachment inquiry\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke. Impeachment, for that?\u201d Trump said during a news conference in New York. He revived the same language he has used for months to deride the now-finished special counsel investigation into election interference, declaring impeachment \u201ca hoax\u201d and the \u201csingle greatest witch hunt in American history.\u201d\n\nRepublicans largely stood by the president and dismissed the notion that the rough transcript revealed any wrongdoing by Trump.\n\n\u201cI think it was a perfectly appropriate phone call, it was a congratulatory phone call,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House Republican. \u201cThe Democrats continually make these huge claims and allegations about President Trump, and then you find out there\u2019s no there there.\u201d\n\nThe memo released by the White House was not a verbatim transcript, but was instead based on the records of officials who listened to the call. The conversation took place on July 25, one day after special counsel Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill about his investigation into Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference.\n\nIn the 30-minute phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump encourages the Ukrainian leader to talk with Giuliani and Barr about Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Immediately after saying they would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine\u2019s economy, saying: \u201cYour economy is going to get better and better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It\u2019s a great country.\u201d\n\nAt another point in the conversation, Trump asked Zelenskiy for a favor: his help looking into a cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and determined it was carried out by Russia. Trump has falsely suggested Crowdstrike was owned by a Ukrainian.\n\nIn the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400 million in military aid for Ukraine \u2014 prompting speculation that he was holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump has denied that charge and the aid package does not come up in the conversation with Zelenskiy.\n\nTrump has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was leading the Obama administration\u2019s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.\n\nBiden said it was \u201ctragedy\u201d that Trump was willing to \u201cput personal politics above his sacred oath.\u201d He singled out Trump\u2019s attempts to pull Barr and the Justice Department into efforts to investigate Biden, calling it \u201ca direct attack on the core independence of that department, an independence essential to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nWhile the possibility of impeachment has hung over Trump for many months, the likelihood of a probe had faded after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation ended without a clear directive for lawmakers.\n\nSince then, the House committees have revisited aspects of the Mueller probe while also launching new inquiries into Trump\u2019s businesses and various administration scandals that all seemed likely to drag on for months.\n\nBut details of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine prompted Democrats to quickly shift course. By the time Pelosi announced the probe, about two-thirds of House Democrats had announced moving toward impeachment probes.\n\nThe burden will probably now shift to Democrats to make the case to a scandal-weary public. In a highly polarized Congress, an impeachment inquiry could simply showcase how clearly two sides can disagree when shown the same evidence rather than approach consensus.", "description": "According to the call summary provided by the White House, Trump raised unsubstantiated claims that Joe Biden sought to interfere with a Ukrainian...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GB254_18trum_ZG_20180107192644.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
