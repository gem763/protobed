Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, for instance, leads Mr. Trump by just one percentage point among independents, down from Mr. Biden\u2019s 18 percentage point lead in September. Against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 49% of independents backed Mr. Trump, while 43% favored the Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nAgainst Sen. Bernard Sanders, Mr. Trump drew 48% support from independents, Mr. Sanders, 44 percent, down from a previous nine percentage point lead.\n\n\u201cWhat caused such a dramatic swing in Trump\u2019s favor with independents? Is it a coincidence that this poll was conducted after Nancy Pelosi formally launched an impeachment inquiry into President Trump? Not to me,\u201d Mr. Margolis said.\n\n\u201cImpeachment is not exactly popular among voters, and only a minority of independents support it,\u201d the analyst noted. \u201cMany on the right have warned Democrats that impeachment fever will only benefit Trump in the long run \u2014 and they appear to be proven right by this poll.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
