He was not in his 100 per cent best shape. Now he\u2019s back.\u2019\n\nLiverpool are in action on Wednesday at home to Arsenal in the League Cup, before a trip to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nMORE: Man Utd legend Roy Keane slammed over brutal Liverpool v Tottenham analysis\n\nMORE: Jordan Henderson hails \u2018perfect\u2019 Fabinho after Liverpool\u2019s victory Tottenham", "description": "Joel Matip's knee injury is going to keep him out of action for Liverpool for much longer than first expected, with the defender likely to miss the next six weeks....", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175998908_1572336677.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
