Six months ago, the IMF had forecast a growth rate of 6.1%.\n\nThe downward revision was triggered by \u201cthe effects of escalating tariffs and weakening external demand,\u201d which have \u201cexacerbated the slowdown associated with needed regulatory strengthening to rein in the accumulation of debt,\u201d the report states.\n\nAmong economists, there appears to be a disagreement over which effect is making a greater contribution to the country\u2019s dismal growth prospects.\n\nJennifer Lee, senior economist and director of economic research at BMO Capital Markets, believes that the trade war is to blame.\n\n\u201cChina is still reliant on trade, even though exports as the share of the economy has declined,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tariffs that the U.S. has imposed on China\u2019s goods that cross over the Pacific are hurting those industries.\u201d\n\nOn top of which, retaliatory tariffs China has placed on American goods such as pork and soybeans have curbed Chinese demand, Lee said.\n\nUnlike Lee, Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics, said the trade war is just one side of the coin.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s economy has been impacted by serious headwinds, especially stemming from slower global trade, the U.S.-China trade war and the effect that has on the appetite to invest.\u201d\n\nKuijs said that the service and consumption sector has \u201cbeen the most robust in relative terms, in the sense that growth there has slowed down less than elsewhere in the economy.\u201d The latest figures indicate that the retail sector in China for the first three quarters of the year increased by 8.2% compared to last year.\n\n\u201cBut, in part because household consumption is still a modest share of GDP\u201d around 38%, he said, \u201cthis relative resilience has not been enough to fully offset the headwinds, which is why overall growth has slowed.\u201d\n\nCompared to the rest of the world, China\u2019s 6% growth rate doesn\u2019t rattle Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\n\u201cIt seems to us that in a world where average GDP growth is barely over 3%, China\u2019s growth rate of 6% is not too shabby,\u201d Weinberg said in a note.\n\nHe added that there are pockets of hope in China\u2019s third-quarter report.\n\nMonthly figures like the industrial production rate in September, which was 1.6% higher than in August, and the electrical production rate, which rose to 4.7%, he considers to be \u201csigns of a nascent recovery.\u201d\n\nLike Kuijs, he agreed that \u201cconsumer spending remains a weak link in China\u2019s economic picture.\u201d\n\nAs for the trade war, there is some progress being made to negotiate a deal with China.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said earlier this month that the U.S. and China had reached a \u201cvery substantial phase one deal.\u201d This portion of the deal, Trump said, will address intellectual property concerns and $40 billion to $50 billion worth of agricultural purchases will be made by China. The U.S. also held off on slapping additional tariffs on Chinese imports.", "description": "Latest IMF projections predict China\u2019s GDP growth to slow to 5.8% by 2020.", "authors": ["Elisabeth Buchwald"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT718_chinag_ZG_20191021132726.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
