However, the report struck a nerve with the outgoing European Council President Donald Tusk who flashed some recognisably undiplomatic language when he accused the prime minister of trying to win \u201csome stupid blame game\u201d.\n\nNo 10 Source: No Deal a Certainty Either Now or After Election https://t.co/RbyzCAu37K \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 8, 2019\n\nThe report comes after a Number 10 source told The Spectator: \u201cThose who think Merkel will help us are deluded.\u201d\n\nSteve Baker, chairman of the Conservative Party\u2019s European Research Group (ERG), told Sky News: \u201cThe problem that we face here is that the EU is trying to exercise a veto on whether part of our country can leave the Customs Union.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve effectively set up a narrative that you can\u2019t leave the European Union. That\u2019s a stark warning to all of us who wish to live in a democracy.\u201d\n\nMr Baker also condemned the bloc for \u201ctreat[ing] Northern Ireland like an enclave which can be left behind\u201d which he said was \u201can ultimate red line for the prime minister\u201d and \u201ccertainly a red line for the DUP\u201d.\n\nArlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals had \u201cflushed out Dublin\u2019s real intention to trap Northern Ireland in the EU Customs Union forever\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will not accept any such ultimatum or outcome,\u201d she added.\n\nA Number 10 source revealed to The Spectator this morning that the government stands by delivering a no-deal Brexit, whether by October 31st or after a forced extension, the figure saying: \u201cThe negotiations will probably end this week.\u201d", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told Prime Minister Boris Johnson that a new exit treaty is \"overwhelmingly unlikely\".", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Angela-Merkel-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
