It went up in flames remarkably fast. I thought it would take longer to burn, but it was like a minute and a half \u2014 it was crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe house just collapsed in one large movement with a lot of sound to it. By that time it was fully in flames. It went up in flames remarkably fast.\u201d \u2014 Dann Laudermilch, neighbor\n\nPolice and fire units responded around 2:30 p.m. to find the man's vehicle and cell phone out front. Hours passed before a crew using heavy machinery found the man\u2019s body around 8 p.m., Pittsburgh\u2019s WTAE-TV reported.\n\nThe death was ruled a suicide and the man's name was not released. Family members were away from the home at the time, attending the daughter\u2019s wedding, officials said. It remained unclear who lived in the home with the man. No additional deaths were reported.\n\nIn addition to Laudermilch, other neighbors described feeling their own homes shake during the explosion, causing them to go outside to find out what happened.\n\n\u201cWe came outside to see what was going on, and the house was in flames \u2014 still standing \u2014 but in flames,\u201d neighbor Donna Antolovich told the Post-Gazette. \u201cThree to five minutes before the house blew up, the owner was standing in front of it. After that, nobody could find him.\u201d\n\nThe cause of the explosion remained under investigation, but Edgewood police Chief Robert Payne said it appeared the man \u201cmay have been able to disconnect the gas line itself in the basement of the house and of course it wouldn't take much but a spark to explode the house after that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPolice said they had been to the home before for domestic issues relating to mental illness. A house next door that was damaged by the fire had recently been sold, and officials say a family had been planning to move in soon.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Pennsylvania man apparently committed suicide on his daughter's\u00a0wedding day\u00a0by blowing up his suburban Pittsburgh home, authorities say.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace", "Dann Laudermilch"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/iStock-637793456.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
