The tool walks through the enrollment process from start to finish and allows users to view and compare Part D and many of the supplemental benefits that Medicare Advantage plans offer. It also features a star rating system which gives an overall rating of the plan's quality and performance for the types of services each plan offers.\n\nTake Action Before Open Enrollment Ends\n\nMedicare Open Enrollment ends Dec. 7.
