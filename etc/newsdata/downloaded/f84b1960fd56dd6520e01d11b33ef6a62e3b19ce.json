This is not acceptable.\n\n\u201dThere is a shocking lack of protection in the workplace \u2013 and sexual harassment remains all too common. Fawcett has long campaigned for the law on sexual harassment to be strengthened and welcomes this important response from the Bar Council.\u201c", "description": "A professional body which represents barristers has called for the government to implement new policies on sexual harassment in the workplace.
