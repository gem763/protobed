Old Trafford also cannot currently accommodate the 35 required broadcast cameras.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\n\nOld Trafford was last renovated in 2006 when second tiers were added to the north-west and north-east corners of the ground to increase the capacity to 74,879 seats.\n\nA statement from Manchester United said: \"Old Trafford was part of the England World Cup 2018/22 bid and will host Rugby League World Cup games in 2021.\n\n\"As with previous large scale events - Euro 96, 2003 Champions League final, 2012 Olympic games \u2013 and in common with many club stadia that host major international tournament games, we would work with FIFA to adapt existing facilities if required.\"", "description": "Old Trafford has staged huge occasions but facilities don't meet current FIFA standard for World Cup matches - although club says they can be adapted", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20541424.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-United-v-Rochdale-AFC-Carabao-Cup-Third-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
