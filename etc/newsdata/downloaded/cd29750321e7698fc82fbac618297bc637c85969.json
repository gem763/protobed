It\u2019s like trying to protect the horse and buggy from the automobile technology,\u201d he said, according to NPR. \u201cIt makes no sense to go back to technology from two centuries ago, when we have new technology today which saves consumers money and helps protect the environment by reducing the amount of power that we need.\u201d\n\nMr. deLaski accused the Trump administration of putting company profits over advancing and improving lightbulb efficiency.\n\n\u201cEvery time a consumer shifts to an LED, that lightbulb is going to last 10 years or longer. So the lightbulb manufacturers are trying to save technology that keeps the consumer coming back to buy another bulb every year, but still wastes a lot of energy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe reversal will likely face a legal battle as many environmental groups have threatened to sue the federal government.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
