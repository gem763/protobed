But, to ensure her professor didn't put the essay in the bin, she left a note in normal ink saying \"heat the paper\".\n\nNinjas explained\n\nA person who uses ninjutsu - an independent type of warfare - is a ninja\n\nThe ninja tradition dates back hundreds of years to Japan's feudal era\n\nNinjas were experts in espionage and strategy\n\nThey were popularised in US movies such as Enter the Ninja , but Hollywood's depiction of ninjas can be misleading\n\n, but Hollywood's depiction of ninjas can be misleading Source: Ninja Museum of Igaryu\n\nThe professor, Yuji Yamada, told the BBC he was \"surprised\" when he saw the essay.\n\n\"I had seen such reports written in code, but never seen one done in aburidashi,\" he said.\n\n\"To tell the truth, I had a little doubt that the words would come out clearly. But when I actually heated the paper over the gas stove in my house, the words appeared very clearly and I thought 'Well done!'\n\n\"I didn't hesitate to give the report full marks - even though I didn't read it to the very end because I thought I should leave some part of the paper unheated, in case the media would somehow find this and take a picture.\"\n\nAs for the essay itself, Ms Haga said it had more style than substance.\n\n\"I was confident that the professor would at least recognise my efforts to make a creative essay,\" she said.\n\n\"So I wasn't really worried about getting a bad score for my essay - though the content itself was nothing special.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by the BBC's Hideharu Tamura in Tokyo", "description": "Eimi Haga handed in what looked like a blank sheet of paper - but left her professor a crucial clue.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9D9B/production/_109174304_haga3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
