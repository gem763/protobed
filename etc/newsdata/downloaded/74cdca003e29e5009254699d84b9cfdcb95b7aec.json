But Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 50/50 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. They are running scared. Her opponents could be forgiven for feeling the same way.\n\nAfter all, Asher-Smith is this year\u2019s Diamond League winner over 100m, the clear favourite for gold over 200m, and the vital cog in Britain\u2019s 4x100m women\u2019s relay team who won silver in London two years ago. For most people in the sport it is not a question of whether she will win a medal in Doha, but how many and of which colour.\n\nMake athletics great again: how does Coe ensure casual fans become converts? | Sean Ingle Read more\n\nThat is an enormous weight for Asher-Smith to bear on her 23-year-old shoulders, especially given that \u2013 Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir apart \u2013 the British team do not possess a deep well of individual medal talent at these championships.\n\nAsher-Smith insists that she has been planning to go global since 2017 \u2013 and is now ready to deliver. \u201cMy coach John Blackie has been putting me through my paces for a very long time to prepare for this,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen we came off London 2017 and went into training for 2018, that was when we made the decision that I was going to double up and that is the time period you need to build up the strength to be able to put together six elite standard sprint races in a championships. We have been preparing for a very, very long time. It has been painful. John has been testing me. When he tells me: \u2018You are doing this today,\u201d I am like: \u2018What?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut we have been preparing and that is why the decision to double up isn\u2019t one that I have taken lightly, it\u2019s not a flippant decision.\u201d\n\nThe European championships last year in Berlin proved the perfect dress rehearsal as Asher-Smith beat her British records in running 10.85sec to win the 100m and 21.89 to take the 200m before winning her third gold in leading the relay team to victory with a stunning anchor leg. This time she knows it will be tougher, especially in the 100m where she faces the formidable Jamaican Olympic champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson, who have both run 10.73 this season. The word from the Jamaican camp is that both are in fantastic shape for Doha, which could put gold out of reach for Asher-Smith in that event.\n\nHowever in the 200m she is clearly the women to beat, especially with the Bahaman Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who has not lost a race since 2017, deciding to only run the 400m because of scheduling issues.\n\nWhile Asher-Smith knows a podium place in the 100m or 200m would make her the first British woman since Kathy Smallwood-Cook in 1983 to win a global sprint medal, she insists she is not feeling the pressure. \u201cWeirdly enough I don\u2019t and I think that is because I tune out of social media. We have been very clear, John and I, about what my aims are for this season. And we don\u2019t really publicly disclose that until afterwards and that is done deliberately to control expectation.\n\n\u201cThere definitely is a little bit of expectation but it is something that is nice and something that is refreshing as a British female sprinter \u2013 we expect you to do X, Y and Z.\u201d\n\nHowever as she prepares for her first race, in the 100m heats on Saturday, Asher-Smith knows she is facing a moment of truth. \u201cThe world championships is going to be the first time where we see everybody with nowhere to hide this year. There\u2019s no \u2018I wasn\u2019t ready for this, I wasn\u2019t ready for this\u2019, because if you are not ready for the world championships, when are you ready?\u201d", "description": "The British sprinter, who is favourite to win gold in the 200m, is aiming to become the first British athlete to win three medals at a world championships", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2195fff7877319f166b98f2e55d4258e041fd0df/89_34_1983_1190/master/1983.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56154d2671133a2afe49ddfcac44ed6f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
