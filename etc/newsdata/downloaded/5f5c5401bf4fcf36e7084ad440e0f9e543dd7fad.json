Bernard Sanders unveiled his first television commercial of the 2020 presidential campaign, casting himself as a proven warrior for workers and those struggling to get by.\n\nThe \u201cFight for Us\u201d ad features footage from Mr. Sanders\u2019 campaign kickoff rally, where he shared the story of how being raised in a family that \u201cstruggled economically powerfully influenced my life and my values.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this moment, we need a fighter,\u201d the narrator says. \u201cBernie Sanders. We know he\u2019ll fight for us as president because he always has.\u201d\n\nThe narrator says that Mr. Sanders has led the charge for $15 minimum wage, \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and civil rights.\n\n\u201cWhether it was Wall Street, the drug companies or other powerful special interests, Bernie has taken them on. For us,\u201d the narrator says in the 60-second ad.\n\n\u201cNow, our country is at a turning point. A dangerous demagogue tearing our nation apart, hard-working people betrayed by [President] Trump, a health care system that makes enormous profits for drug and insurance companies, and a planet on the brink of a climate disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Sanders campaign said the television ad is part of a $1.3 million buy in Iowa, signaling a new phase in the campaign for the Vermont independent.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
