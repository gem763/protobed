So recently, when Japanese Twitter user @mrmehoso11 was on a train where one of the other passengers was a pregnant woman, the following scene took place.\n\n\u201cThere was a group of middle-school boys on the train, and one of them noticed a pregnant woman and offered her his seat. She said she was getting off at the next stop, though, so she turned down the offer, and when the boy sat down again his friends laughed and called him \u2018lame.\u2019\n\nWhen they did that, the pregnant woman spoke up and said \u2018He\u2019s not lame. He\u2019s totally cool, and just the kind of guy whose girlfriend I\u2019d want to be.\u2019\n\nI wish I could show you how red all his friends\u2019 faces turned.\u201d\n\nOther commenters were quick to applaud both the courteous kid and the intended recipient of his kindness, reacting with:\n\n\u201cThe ones who\u2019re lame are all the other people on the train who didn\u2019t offer her their seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get a little older, those other kids will realize that he was being a perfect gentleman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re kind to others, that kindness comes flying back to you like a boomerang.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet the boy will remember what she said, and it\u2019ll encourage him to be kind to someone again in the future.\u201d\n\nHowever, more than a few commenters, including some who identified themselves as teens or parents of teens, thought that maybe the jeering kids on the train didn\u2019t quite deserve to be thrown under the bus. Many of them, and @mrmehoso11 himself, interpreted the \u201clame\u201d comment to be not in reference to the boy offering his seat to the woman, but to his gesture getting rejected.\n\n\u201cWhen he got back to his seat, if everyone had just silently ignored what happened, it would have made the atmosphere in the group awkward,\u201d said one person, with multiple other commenters feeling like making wisecracks was an attempt (though arguably a blunt and clumsy one) to make the situation something to chuckle about, instead of letting stony silence suggest that his offer, by virtue of being ultimately unneeded, had also been totally pointless.\n\nEven @mrmehoso11, after having more time to mull things over, sent out a follow-up tweet in which he cut the other kids some slack, recognizing that coming straight out and recognizing that \u201cHis friends\u2019 choice of words wasn\u2019t nice, but that\u2019s a complicated age for kids, and I understand that it\u2019s hard for them to act sweet and sensitive, so I don\u2019t want to be too hard on them. After the incident, looking at the friends\u2019 faces you could tell that they completely understood they\u2019d behaved in an embarrassing way.\u201d He even went so far as to offer an apology to the friends if they happened to be reading.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, I see a lot of comments that are angry at the friends for what they said, but that\u2019s entirely on me for not explaining the situation properly. Looking back at my first tweet, I ended up making them sound heartless. I\u2019m really sorry. If the friends are reading this, please don\u2019t worry about it. Anyone who was actually on the train could see the bond of friendship you have with each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone in this story is so nice. It\u2019s making me get choked up,\u201d wrote one commenter after reading the whole thing.\n\nSource: Twitter/@mrmehoso11 via Hachima Kiko\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Schoolboy offers elderly man seat on train, gets publicly berated for doing just that\n\n-- To sit or not to sit?
