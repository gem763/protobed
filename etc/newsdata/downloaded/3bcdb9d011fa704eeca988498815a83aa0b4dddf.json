The U.S. government\u2019s pending decision comes amid broader tensions between Washington and Riyadh, through which President Trump has largely stood by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nThe law allows the Justice Department to withhold certain documents under the rarely used states secret privilege, designed to prevent the release of information that would harm national security if disclosed in the course of civil litigation.\n\nInvoking the privilege requires Attorney General William Barr \u2019s approval.\n\nA judge agreed to postpone a Friday deadline until Sept. 12, after the Justice Department suggested in a court filing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation intends to try to keep at least some of the information from public view.\n\n\u201cWe make this request because the FBI\u2019s response to the motion is being coordinated at the highest levels of the Department of Justice,\u201d Manhattan\u2019s U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman wrote.\n\nIt was the second time in recent weeks the Justice Department has sought more time, an indication officials are carefully weighing the decision.\n\nReleasing the information could further strain the relationship with the Saudi government. But refusing to do so would pit the administration and the FBI against the families of 9/11 victims and survivors, hundreds of whom delivered a letter to Mr. Trump recently urging him \u201cto instruct Attorney General Barr not to invoke privileges and to give us the FBI documents so that we can finally learn the full truth and obtain justice from Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nThe letter makes an appeal to Mr. Trump as a New Yorker, and includes deprecating remarks about former Justice Department officials whom Mr. Trump has previously attacked, as well as criticism of former President Obama.\n\nSigners of the letter said they were \u201cbetrayed\u201d by Mr. Obama, who in September 2016 vetoed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which authorized families to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. Mr. Obama said he had deep sympathy for the families but felt the legislation would expose the U.S. to similar lawsuits. The veto was then overridden by Congress.\n\nThe Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment.\n\nThe families and their backers are hopeful the appeals have resonated. \u201cIt is my belief that President Trump wants to succeed for the 9/11 families where President Obama failed,\u201d said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) who has had several conversations with Mr. Trump about the U.S.-Saudi relationship.\n\nThe victims\u2019 federal lawsuit in New York accuses the Saudi government of helping coordinate the 2001 suicide attacks. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when terrorists crashed hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and, after passengers resisted, a Pennsylvania field.\n\nMost of the attackers were from Saudi Arabia; Riyadh has denied complicity in the attacks.\n\nThe families had sought an unredacted copy of a four-page 2012 summary of an FBI inquiry into three people who may have assisted two of the hijackers in California in finding housing, obtaining driver\u2019s licenses and other matters. The Justice Department must explain whether it would provide an unredacted version of the document.\n\nTwo of the people, Fahad al-Thumairy and Omar al-Bayoumi, were linked to the Saudi government, according to FBI and congressional documents. The third person, whose name is redacted, is described in the summary as having tasked the other two with assisting the hijackers.\n\nLast year, lawyers for the families subpoenaed the FBI for an unredacted copy of the document, on the belief that the third person was potentially a senior Saudi official who exercised authority over both of the men.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s official involvement in the planning of the 9/11 attacks is the subject of some dispute. The 9/11 Commission said in its 2004 report it didn\u2019t find evidence that Mr. al-Thumairy had provided assistance to the two operatives. It also said it had seen \u201cno credible evidence\u201d that Mr. al-Bayoumi \u201cbelieved in violent extremism or knowingly aided extremist groups.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, the commission revisited the issue and assessed more recent evidence regarding Messrs. al-Thumairy and al-Bayoumi, and said it didn\u2019t find the new information enough to change the original findings. It said there was an \u201congoing internal debate\u201d within the FBI about the potential significance of some of the information, and encouraged FBI leadership to review the perspectives and continue the investigation accordingly.\n\nAttorneys for the victims\u2019 families argued that the two men had provided support to the two hijackers in a \u201chighly coordinated, state-run-and-initiated covert operation,\u201d and filed affidavits written by former FBI officials over the past two years making the case.\n\nThe alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, opened the door in July to helping victims of the attacks in their lawsuit against Saudi Arabia if the U.S. government spares him the death penalty at a Guantanamo Bay military commission.\n\nWrite to Aruna Viswanatha at Aruna.Viswanatha@wsj.com, Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com and Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com", "description": "The Trump administration asked for more time to decide whether to shield documents concerning allegations of official Saudi involvement in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.", "authors": ["Aruna Viswanatha", "Alex Leary", "Sadie Gurman", "Aruna.Viswanatha Wsj.Com", "Alex.Leary Wsj.Com", "Sadie.Gurman Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104766/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
