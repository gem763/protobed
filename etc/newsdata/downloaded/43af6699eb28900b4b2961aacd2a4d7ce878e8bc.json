(Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images for Film at London)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 For most of its existence, Netflix has sworn devotion to a model that puts content on the devices of its millions of subscribers as quickly and conveniently as possibly.\n\nAnd for much of his career, Martin Scorsese has pledged fidelity to the purest form of cinema, one in which films are made in the most exacting way and then consumed at a particular moment by a select group of people.\n\nNow the two have joined forces.\n\nIn a sign of just how strange the streaming wars\u2019 bedfellows can be, Scorsese is poised to debut \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d a 3\u00bd-hour, $150 million mob epic that reunites him with stars Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. The distributor? Netflix.\n\nThe company premiered the movie Friday at the New York Film Festival, ahead of a limited theatrical run beginning Nov. 1 and a worldwide release to Netflix\u2019s roughly 160 million subscribers Nov. 27.\n\nThe film world and Hollywood are watching closely. However the movie is received, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d marks a watershed moment \u2014 either signaling a fresh mode of collaboration between Hollywood\u2019s old and new guards or showing how incompatible, and commercially unwise, such a partnership would be.\n\n\u201cThe question for this film is clearly one of stakes,\u201d said Kent Jones, the director of the New York Film Festival and a close friend of Scorsese\u2019s. \u201cBut stakes for whom? Netflix? Studios? Martin Scorsese?\"\n\nOr, he said, \u201cIt could be all of them.\u201d\n\nAt a time when Netflix has become a kind of old dog in a digital-content landscape soon to be beset by Apple, Disney and others, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d is proving a surprisingly new and unknown experiment for the company.\n\nMuch as \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d set Netflix on a course of big-budget, high-end television six years ago, and made us think about the streaming service differently in the process, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d could have a similar impact with feature films. While Netflix has made high-end dramas before (\u201cRoma\u201d) and big-budget commercial movies (\u201cBright\u201d) it\u2019s never combined the two in this way.\n\nNot that there aren\u2019t challenges. From a distribution standpoint, there is the movie\u2019s length, the size of a director\u2019s cut that even the friendliest of studios rarely allows these days. There is also the scope, spanning some five decades in the life of De Niro\u2019s lead hit-man character Frank and his intersection with Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino. And finally, there is the film\u2019s tone, a kind of low-key melancholia that is the opposite of a big, buzzy crime movie and its accompanying social-media traction that streaming services crave.\n\nFrom the director\u2019s standpoint, the issue is simple: He is in a place that feels deeply un-Scorsese-like.\n\nScorsese is one of the last of Hollywood\u2019s bankable auteurs \u2014 he\u2019s had four original movies that took in more than $100 million, a rarity in an era when such earnings are almost always for franchise movies. Collectively, his movies have grossed nearly $2 billion around the world. He also remains one of the directors who embodies Hollywood\u2019s ability to hold the line against the onslaught of comic books and branded properties, nearly always generating his own material or adapting lesser-known books.\n\nHis new movie both illustrates the challenge Netflix faces in advancing its model and the reasons it\u2019s become so powerful in the first place. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d was a work that began its development life as a conversation between Scorsese, De Niro, producers and Paramount 12 years ago. But the Viacom-owned studio began balking at the budget, which involved more than 115 locations and an expensive \u201cde-aging\u201d technology designed to make stars look younger.\n\nEventually, anticipated costs sailed into the $150 million range. That put it within reach only of Silicon Valley disruptors looking to build a brand and subscriber base and who didn\u2019t operate with the business model of traditional studies that every film must break even.\n\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t get the backing for years,\u201d Scorsese told reporters after the screening. \u201cAnd ultimately it was Ted Sarandos and everyone at Netflix,\u201d he said, referring to Netflix\u2019s chief content officer. \u201cThey said, \u2018Go for it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEach side is compromising a little when it comes to distribution \u2014 Scorsese is allowing it to begin streaming a month into its release, and Netflix has agreed to that four weeks.\n\nBut the movie\u2019s release is hampered by the fact that the three biggest theater chains in the United States, AMC, Regal and Cinemark, won\u2019t play it because the movie does not follow a traditional three-month window of theatrical exclusivity.\n\nThe chains are taking a traditional \u2014 and as of now, unified \u2014 stance as they seek to force Netflix\u2019s hand. Netflix, they believe, wants Hollywood\u2019s biggest prize, which can be difficult without a traditional release. The firm has yet to win a best picture Oscar.\n\nBut analysts say Netflix has shrewdly put theaters in a no-win situation with \u201cIrishman\u201d \u2014 the chains must either surrender or end up hurting themselves.\n\n\u201cThe problem for the theaters is that if they don\u2019t carry the Netflix big-budget movie slate they are effectively pushing consumers to increasingly expect to get first-run big-budget content in their homes or on their personal devices,\u201d said Pivotal Research Group founder Jeff Wlodarczak, who personally tracks entertainment subscription services.\n\nScorsese\u2019s experience with Netflix will also help Netflix cement talent relationships in a way that is invaluable \u2014 or risky.\n\n\u201cIf you win over Scorsese, you\u2019ll win over a lot of people,\u201d said one Hollywood agent who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize relationships. \u201cOf course, the reverse is true, too.\u201d A release that fails to gain traction or otherwise troubles Scorsese, the agent said, could make other filmmakers in his class reluctant to bring the company their highest-profile material.\n\nScorsese says he\u2019s still grappling with the reality of his work being consumed largely on home devices.\n\nOne wrinkle to this is that people will be able to pause or shut off his film in a way they can\u2019t in theaters. That could be a godsend for those who wish to digest a three-plus-hour movie in smaller chunks, but also a problem for Netflix. Social-media traffic suggested that audiences turned off some earlier movies, including the recent Adam Sandler \u201cMurder Mystery,\u201d and didn\u2019t turn it back on.\n\nAnd there is no data on how many people watched \u201cRoma\u201d \u2014 Netflix\u2019s major awards contender last year and an appetizer of sorts for the entree of \u201cIrishman\u201d \u2014 in its entirety on the service.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting hybrid \u2014 how do you balance what a film is and what is viewed at home?\u201d Scorsese said, acknowledging he was puzzling it out.\n\nThen again, he said, any conflict he felt about how a massively budgeted dramatic feature would be watched was overtaken by a larger reality: Netflix was the only company willing to pay for it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in an extraordinary time of change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what it comes down to is I felt the picture had to be made.\u201d", "description": "With \"The Irishman,\" Martin Scorsese and Netflix look to change the streaming game.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "September At Pm", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
