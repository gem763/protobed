(AP Photo/Hadi Mizban)\n\nBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraq\u2019s premier on Friday sent a message to anti-government protesters, saying their \u201clegitimate demands\u201d have been heard and urging them to go home while also comparing security measures imposed in the wake of this week\u2019s violence, including a curfew, to \u201cbitter medicine\u201d that needs to be swallowed.\n\nPrime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi spoke in a televised address to the nation following three days of demonstrations that have spread across many provinces in the country. Since Tuesday, security forces have fired live rounds and tear gas every day to disperse the protesters, leaving 33 people dead and hundreds wounded.\n\nAuthorities have also cut internet access in much of Iraq since late Wednesday, in a desperate move to curb the rallies.\n\nThe rallies have erupted spontaneously, mostly spurred by youths wanting jobs, improved services such as electricity and water, and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country\n\n\u201cWe will not make empty promises ... or promise what we cannot achieve,\u201d Abdul-Mahdi said in his televised speech, broadcast at 2:30 a.m.\n\nHe said there is \u201cno magic solution\u201d to Iraq\u2019s problems but pledged to work on laws granting poor families a basic income, provide alternative housing to violators and fight corruption.\n\n\u201cThe security measures we are taking, including temporary curfew, are difficult choices. But like bitter medicine, they are inevitable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to return life to normal in all provinces and respect the law.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the protesters\u2019 response to Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s statements will be.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge for his year-old government, which also has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nThe mostly leaderless protests have been concentrated in Baghdad and in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Iraq, bringing out jobless youths and university graduates who are suffering under an economy reeling from graft and mismanagement.", "description": "Iraq\u2019s premier on Friday sent a message to anti-government protesters, saying their \u201clegitimate demands\u201d have been heard and urging them to go home while also comparing security measures imposed in the wake of this week\u2019s violence, including a curfew, to \u201cbitter medicine\u201d that needs to be swallowed.", "authors": ["Qassim Abdul-Zahra"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wzFI3xzYZEZya6O8WVjBrA--~B/aD0yOTg4O3c9NDA1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/21eb901f155bd9ecbe05205628ab57e3", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
