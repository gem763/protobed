Many of the girls came from poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making good money.'\n\nThis investigation into Brunel runs parallel to one into convicted pedophile Epstein, who at one point gave Brunel $1 million to launch a new modelling agency in the United States.\n\nThat investment earned Epstein a steady supply of underage girls - as many as 1,000 - who were procured by Brunel, often by bringing minor victims from Europe to the United States by offering them a modelling contract through Karin or another agency, MC2.\n\nIn one instance, according to claims made by former Epstein sex slave Virginia Roberts in court filings, Brunel provided Epstein with three sisters who were all aged 12 for his birthday.\n\nThe search of Brunel's former agency Karin Models seemed to further bolster the investigation into Epstein, as authorities raided his Paris apartment one week later.\n\nBrunel had not been with Karin however for over a decade, and has kept a low profile in recent years.\n\nThe Frenchman has been a major player in the modeling industry since the 1970s, and claimed to have launched the careers of Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall and Milla Jovovich.\n\nBrunel also played a large role in the 2005 criminal probe into Epstein that was launched by the Palm Beach Police Department.\n\nTrash pulls organized by the force from Epstein's mansion turned up a number of damning phone messages from Brunel.\n\nThis file photo taken on August 12, 2019 shows an apartment building owned by Jeffrey Epstein in the 16th arrondissement of Paris\n\nThere is one that appears to reference underage girls, another noting how much an 18-year-old woman 'loves Jeffrey' and another in which Brunel relays one doctor's professional opinion on how best to treat a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nDead: This is the first investigation into one of Epstein's cohorts since his arrest\n\nThese messages were all obtained by DailyMail.com after filing an FOIA request for Palm Beach records related to Epstein's legal battles in the decade since he left prison.\n\nAt 8:08am on the morning of April 1, Brunel called Epstein and left a message, which was relayed to Epstein via a note that read: 'He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is 2 x 8 years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have 1st today if call me back.'\n\nBrunel then followed up again at 8:31am and 9:04am, asking that Epstein get in touch.\n\nBradley Edwards, the lawyer for a number of Epstein victims including Virginia Giuffre (n\u00e9e Roberts) included those three messages as evidence after Epstein filed a civil suit against him.\n\n'In light of these circumstances of the case, this message reasonably suggested to Edwards that Brunel might have been procuring two eight-year-old girls for Epstein to sexually abuse,' stated one court filing submitted by Edwards and his lawyer.\n\n'According to widely circulated press reports reviewed by Edwards, Brunel is in his sixties and has a reputation throughout the world (and especially in the modeling industry) as a cocaine addict that has for years molested children through modeling agencies while acting as their agent \u2014 conduct that has been the subject of critical reports, books, several news articles, and a 60 Minutes documentary on Brunel\u2019s sexual exploitation of underage models.'\n\nThat legal battle waged on for years before finally ending in December, when Epstein settled with Edwards and publicly apologized after the lawyer counter sued for defamation.", "description": "Prosecutors in Paris are looking into possible charges of rape and sexual assault against Jeffrey  Epstein, both for crimes that he allegedly committed in France, and Jean-Luc Brunel is helping", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/17/18927002-0-image-a-2_1569429481974.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
