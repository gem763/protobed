Was it to cover up for \u2018Alabama\u2019 Twitter flub?]\n\nIn an unusual move, the statement also admonished its National Weather Service office in Birmingham, Ala., which had released a tweet contradicting Trump\u2019s claim and stating, \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.\u201d\n\nThe NOAA statement said: \u201cThe Birmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\n\nReleased six days after Trump\u2019s first tweet on the matter, the NOAA statement was unsigned, neither from the acting head of the agency nor any particular spokesman. It also came a day after the president\u2019s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser released a statement justifying Trump\u2019s claims of the Alabama threat.\n\nThe NOAA statement Friday makes no reference to the fact that when Trump tweeted that Alabama was at risk, it was not in the National Hurricane Center\u2019s \u201ccone of uncertainty,\u201d which is where forecasters determine the storm is most likely to track. Alabama also had not appeared in the cone in days earlier, and no Hurricane Center text product ever mentioned the state.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet that Alabama would be affected by the storm gained national attention Wednesday when he presented a modified version of the forecast cone from Aug. 29, extended into Alabama \u2014 hand-drawn using a Sharpie. The crudely altered map appeared to represent an effort to retroactively justify the original Alabama tweet.\n\n\n\nComparison between the actual \"cone of uncertainty\" graphic Aug. 29 and the one shown in the White House video on Sept. 4. (NOAA/White House)\n\nThe doctored map went viral, becoming a source of ridicule among political pundits and late-night talk show hosts, who accused the president of dishonesty.\n\n[\u2018Mr. President, you\u2019re going to weather jail\u2019: Trump roasted for altered Hurricane Dorian map]\n\nAltering official government weather forecasts is actually illegal. Per 18 U.S. Code 2074, which addresses false weather reports: \u201cWhoever knowingly issues or publishes any counterfeit weather forecast or warning of weather conditions falsely representing such forecast or warning to have been issued or published by the Weather Bureau, United States Signal Service, or other branch of the Government service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ninety days, or both.\u201d (The Weather Service is the modern version of the Weather Bureau.)\n\nIn the face of criticism about the modified map, Trump fired off additional tweets Wednesday and Thursday, insisting Alabama was at risk all along, including presenting a map from Aug. 29 depicting a small possibility that Alabama would see tropical-storm-force winds.\n\nThe map indicated only a 5 percent to 20 percent chance of such conditions in parts of Alabama beginning Monday. However, by the time of Trump\u2019s tweet Sept. 1, those odds were down to a 5 percent chance of tropical storm conditions in a sliver of extreme southeastern Alabama.\n\nTen days ago, computer model predictions did present a scenario in which Dorian would strike Florida, enter the Gulf of Mexico and potentially affect Alabama. However, by Aug. 29, when the president was briefed by acting NOAA administrator Neil Jacobs, that scenario had become highly unlikely. By Sunday morning, when Trump tweeted about the Alabama threat, no credible computer model showed any risk to the state.\n\nThe Weather Service\u2019s mission is to protect life and property. By releasing the statement admonishing the agency for an accurate forecast, NOAA may be seen as putting politics before facts. This could undermine forecasters\u2019 ability to carry out their mission to the point where people may come to see its weather forecasts as political and untrustworthy.\n\nMany meteorologists, recognizing Alabama was at no risk, expressed their ire on Twitter, stating Trump should have instead focused on communicating Dorian\u2019s hazards to the Southeast coast and dispensed with his preoccupation with Alabama.\n\nWatch meteorologist Bill Karins debunk Trump\u2019s altered hurricane map. https://t.co/GWRdXabxLm \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 5, 2019\n\nJames Franklin, the former chief of a prediction unit at the National Hurricane Center, expressed support for the Birmingham Weather Service office that NOAA admonished.\n\n\u201cI thought Birmingham\u2019s statement Sunday morning that Alabama would see no impacts from Dorian was spot-on and an appropriate response to the President\u2019s misleading tweet that morning,\u201d he wrote in an email. The Hurricane Center\u2019s \"wind-speed-probability product serves as guidance to forecasters, and it showed only a very small likelihood of tropical-storm-force winds in the state, and essentially zero chance of hurricane-force winds.\u201d\n\nHe stated: \u201cI am very surprised that NOAA\u2019s statement today seems to not recognize the value its forecasters add every day to NWS products and services.\u201d\n\nDan Sobien, president of the NWS Employees Union, stated in a tweet Friday evening that \u201cThe hard-working employees of the NWS had nothing to do with the utterly disgusting and disingenuous tweet sent out by NOAA management tonight.\u201d", "description": "NOAA has sided with President Trump on Alabama and Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["Jason Samenow", "Editor", "Writer Covering Weather", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nBinYGpM5QCeSnZYSfF6K25NMPI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YLP4OFGQYUI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
