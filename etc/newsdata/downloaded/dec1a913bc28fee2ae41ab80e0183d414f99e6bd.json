Salah had been hoping to break his duck against Manchester United, having never scored a goal against them in his career, but Divock Origi comes in for the Egyptian star.\n\nSalah's absence will come as a big shock for the league leaders. Jose Mourinho, Graeme Souness and Roy Keane shared their thoughts on what the star man's absence will mean for the game.\n\n'The fact that Salah doesn\u2019t play makes a huge difference,' Mourinho said. 'The last time Salah played against a back three was with a big impact against Roma.'\n\nSouness said Salah was a big loss, but Liverpool's quality throughout the side should come through.\n\n'Salah\u2019s one of their main men. Origi\u2019s a drop in quality,' he said. 'You want your best players on the pitch in big games. I can\u2019t see beyond their quality. Wherever they go they turn up in some form.\n\nAlisson returns having been sidelined since the opening game of the season against Norwich\n\n'I\u2019ve never been so confident of a Liverpool team coming to Old Trafford and having a good day.'\n\nFormer United captain Roy Keane said: 'United have their own problems. They\u2019re going to sit back, they\u2019ve got the pace up front. Because everything points to Liverpool, football\u2019s not as simple as that.\n\n'We expect Liverpool to dominate possession and create chances, but you never know.'\n\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp expressed his disappointment not to have Salah fit for the game, but said he should be fit for their midweek Champions League tie against Genk in Belgium.\n\n'Mo wasn\u2019t ready, he couldn\u2019t train with the team. I don\u2019t know where it came from that everyone said he would play, but there was pretty much no chance today, but maybe for Wednesday,' he said.\n\nJurgen Klopp said Salah is a loss but he should be available for their game on Wednesday\n\n'(Alisson) trained for two, maybe three weeks now with the team so it was clear he could be back today.\n\n'It\u2019s a difference of course (without Salah). . We have to adapt with the system a little bit, but we\u2019ve played before without Mo and you don\u2019t want to do it but it was clear that you have to do it over the season at some point. And now today\u2019s the day. No problem with that.'\n\nAlisson returns for Liverpool after being sidelined since the first game of the season. Former West Ham goalkeeper Adrian had deputised in the Brazilian's absence.\n\nUnited were forced into an alteration in the starting line up after Axel Tuanzebe pulled up with a hip injury in the warm up.
