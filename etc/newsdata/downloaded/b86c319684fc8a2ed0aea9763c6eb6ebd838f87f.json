Today, it\u2019s making an investment in a startup that points to its bigger interest in being a go-to destination for experiences and all things tourism, too. Tiqets, a startup out of Amsterdam that has built a platform for booking tickets for museums and other attractions, has raised $60 million in a Series C round led by the travel giant to expand its platform and wider business. Tiqets has sold millions of tickets in over 60 countries to date, it says.\n\nThe investment also includes backing from previous investors Investion and HPE Growth, and it brings the total raised by Tiqets to $100 million. Luuc Elzinga, the CEO and co-founder of Tiqets, said the startup is not disclosing its valuation but said it was \u201creally happy\u201d with the number.\n\nThis is, for now, a financial investment for Airbnb rather than a strategic one. In other words, the two companies have yet to work together, said Elzinga, although that is the hope longer term. \u201cAirbnb will be involved in the business,\u201d he said, \u201cand that\u2019s interesting because we can also learn from how they scaled.\u201d\n\nScaled is almost an understatement. Starting as a modest marketplace for people to offer spare rooms and sofas to travellers, Airbnb has become one of the outsized guard of startups, raising $4.4 billion in venture funding, valued at $31 billion, and on the road to an IPO in 2020.\n\nWhile the vast majority of that growth has come by way of people posting and booking accommodation in private homes, Airbnb\u2019s interest in Tiqets underscores how the company is itself extending the revenue it can make per user by building out the longer tail of services it offers to its users beyond booking travel accommodation: current offerings include Experiences (in-city, one-day activities), Adventures (multi-day guided tours), and restaurant listings.\n\n\u201cTravelers are seeking out a diverse range of experiences when they visit a new city, \u201d said Airbnb Art and Culture Director Philippe Magid, in a statement. \u201cThe Tiqets team has effectively used new technology to connect travelers to communities and we are excited to support their work.\u201d\n\nIn the wider tourism and travel industry, museums and attractions revenues are estimated to be worth some $160 billion, with ticketing accounting for $60 billion of that.\n\nThe gap in the market that Tiqets is targeting is the shift we\u2019ve seen in how and why people \u2014 both tourists but also those visiting museums and attractions in their own home towns \u2014 purchase tickets to go to these places.\n\nWhile some are still waiting to line up outside a venue for hours, others are opting to go online to buy in advance and use mobile tickets to speed up the process. Museums and most other attractions are not often the places that come to mind when you think \u201ctechnology\u201d, and Tiqets comes in and provides a service to them so that they can meet the demands of more digitally-savvy visitors.\n\nMuseums and other attractions are now gradually starting to think of how to use this to their advantage.\n\nThere was a Very British uproar in the 1980s when London\u2019s Victoria & Albert Museum ran an ad campaign about how it was an \u201cace caff with a quite nice museum attached.\u201d (It is a beautiful cafeteria.) But nowadays those cafes, and the ever-present gift shops, are some of their biggest revenue spinners, so offering tickets online reduces some of the friction in getting people into venues, and into better moods, to spend more money later. And, if users \u201ccheck the box,\u201d the venues can also build their marketing databases to boot.\n\nTiqets, founded in 2014, is still a relatively young business. Elzinga said it works with some 3,000 museum groups and attractions \u2014 with its customer list including some of the world\u2019s most-visited institutions, such as the Louvre in Paris.\n\nIt also partners with some 2,500 travel agencies and portals \u2014 Ctrip is another big customer \u2014 that integrate with Tiqets\u2019 APIs to upsell customers with tickets to venues after they have booked their trips. Some 35% of its revenues currently come by way of these third-party deals.\n\nTiqets\u2019 plans for the investment will be to expand its coverage to more attractions, and to extend deeper into smaller towns beyond the big cities where it\u2019s currently most active, specifically building out better self-service technology (not unlike Airbnb\u2019s for hosts) to make it easier to onboard to its platform. It\u2019s now available in 14 languages, so adding more localisation is also on the cards.\n\nOne area where Tiqets does not plan to expand is into performance or seated event ticketing a la Ticketmaster or Eventbrite.\n\n\u201cOur focus and opportunity will continue to be museums and attractions,\u201d Elzinga said. Part of the reason for this is that so many of them continue to provide paper-based, kiosk-issued tickets, but also because of the rise of the blockbuster, and the new awareness of public safety in crowded, high profile, iconic tourist spots. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more complex, with timed entry and issues like crowd management.\u201d\n\nLonger term, it will be interesting to see how and if Airbnb works more closely with Tiqets. Both are targeting what is a massive opportunity. Travel and tourism are some $8.8 trillion and will account for 10.4% of global GDP in 2019, according to one estimate.", "description": "Airbnb is best known for being the place you go to book a place to stay when travelling that\u2019s not a hotel.
