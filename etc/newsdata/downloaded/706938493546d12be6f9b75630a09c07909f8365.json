It was a beautiful scene from a distance, yet what had just happened down below was basically hell on earth,\u201d Behr explained in an interview with Warrior Maven.\n\nThis violence and near-death for Behr is now known as the famous battle of Shok Valley in Afghanistan, 2008; the mission on that April day was called \u201cOperation Commando Wrath.\u201d\n\nBehr was part of a 12-man US Special Forces A-team tasked with taking out a high-value enemy target up in the mountains; his unit was joined by another supporting 12-man Green Beret A-team and about 100 Afghan Commandos. Behr was part of the 3rd Special Forces Group, ODA 3336.\n\nARMY SETS SIGHTS ON NEW FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY\n\nWhile Green Berets are, among other things, experienced with helicopter rope drops and various kinds of airborne attack raids typically employed in assaults of this kind, Behr\u2019s unit was forced to climb the side of a mountain and attack on foot due to the rugged terrain and relative inexperience of their Afghan Commando partners.\n\nBehr recalled the combat scene on the mountain, at an elevation of about 1,000 feet, as dreary with grey rocks, some small trees and not much vegetation. The uneven terrain was accompanied by some snow on the ground and a partially iced-over river. Concrete-like looking mud huts and small villages were scattered in rows and villages along ridges of the mountainside.\n\nHaving completed Special Forces training, selection and preparation, Behr had spent years preparing for life-and-death combat scenarios he knew he was about to encounter.\n\nHe was a trained fighter, trainer and teacher working as part of a close-knit group focused on a specific attack mission. Behr was an intelligence and communications specialist, yet like all Green Berets, he was first and foremost a fighter, equipped and ready to respond to fast-evolving combat situations.\n\nSOLDIERS USE AI TO FIRE PRECISION GRENADES, GUIDE DRONE ATTACKS\n\n\u201cAs we started climbing, we encountered insurgents\u2026 around 200 enemy combatants. They had the high ground and had us surrounded,\u201d he recalled.\n\nDuring a subsequent, fast-ensuing firefight, Behr and his fellow Green Berets used what rocks, small trees and ditches they could find to both avert enemy gunfire and launch counterattacks.\n\n\u201cWe had intelligence that a high-value target was going to be there, someone traditionally hard to track down. We did not know there would be so many fighters and enemy forces there. We happened upon a much larger meeting of enemy combatants than we had expected,\u201d he said.\n\nAt one point during the unfolding 7-hour firefight, Behr was abruptly thrown to the ground by a larger caliber bullet cutting through the side of his pelvis. The bullet blew out the ball and socket of his hip. \u201cIt was like I was struck by a car or baseball bat and being electrocuted at the same time,\u201d he said.\n\nHOW AI CHANGES ATTACK MISSIONS FOR US FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS\n\nThis near-fatal strike, unfortunately, was only the beginning of Behr\u2019s effort to stay alive. While fellow A-Team Green Beret intelligence specialist Luis Morales was tending to his injury, a second bullet ripped through Behr\u2019s bicep and continued on to hit Morales in the thigh.\n\nBehr described the painful sensation of feeling a bullet cut through the muscle in his bicep as minor compared to the initial hit to his pelvis\u2026 a scenario which can make it seemingly impossible to imagine the magnitude of pain he experienced upon first being shot.\n\nAs he fought to stay conscious and his teammates scrambled to stop the bleeding, Behr himself was focused on the survival and safety of his fellow Green Berets under attack.\n\n\u201cI have vivid memories of laying there almost helpless and being concerned about a building across the valley that had direct access to our team. If someone was to shoot from there, we were pretty exposed. I remember directing some people on the team and having them take that out with a large bomb,\u201d he said.\n\n'FIRST-CUT-OF-STEEL' BEGINS NEW ERA IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, SUBMARINE WARFARE\n\nUS air support then arrived to destroy attacking insurgents; shrapnel from a bomb mistakenly struck Behr, perforating his intestines.\n\nWhen confronting what he thought was certain death, Behr thought of his fellow soldiers and family back home in Illinois.\n\n\u201cThere was a point where I thought I was going to leave this world. At one point I thought I was not going to make it, so I said a prayer to myself and felt a calm come over me. Then, all of a sudden, Ron Shurer, the medic on our team, slapped me across the face and said \u2018wake up you are not going to die today,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe intensity of the firefight, volume of enemy bullets and massive scale of the attacks are still difficult for Behr to recall and describe, the sharpness of certain powerful and violent memories have found a permanent resting place in his mind. Then, at the very moment Behr thought he might have an opportunity to live, the attacks worsened.\n\nNEW AIR FORCE NUCLEAR-ARMED ICBMS TO DEPLOY BY 2029\n\nJust after telling Behr he would not die, Shurer himself took a bullet to the helmet right above his face.\n\nFortunately, the bullet bounced off his helmet. \u201cIt could have been much worse,\u201d Behr said.\n\nFour Americans were critically injured and MEDEVAC\u2019ed to Landstuhl Army Medical Center in Germany and then Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Two Afghan Commandos were killed, including an interpreter.\n\nIn total, 11 Silver Stars and one Air Force Cross were awarded for the events of that day.\n\nELITE DRONE AND ATTACK HELICOPTER TASK FORCE STILL HUNTS TALIBAN IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n\u201cThe heroic part is what my team did and how they kept it together under heavy enemy gunfire. They risked their lives to get me and the other injured guys on the team off of that mountain. They were dragging and dropping me over the ledges and trying to catch me off of the ledges,\u201d Behr explained.\n\nDespite this accumulation of combat trauma and near death experience, Behr has made an astounding recovery. Following medical treatment, Behr went on to earn a Masters degree in Security Studies at Georgetown University before starting a non-profit gym for injured Soldiers at Walter Reed.\n\nWhen asked how he was able to go on after his combat experience, Behr said \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to do. We're given abilities and skills and it is a shame to waste them. Even after we leave the military, we have a responsibility to become leaders in our communities.\u201d\n\nAs of 2017, Behr worked as a professional liability and cyber liability broker for Risk Placement Services, a Washington D.C.-area firm.\n\nIn a manner quite similar to many Green Berets, known as \u201cQuiet Professionals\u201d often reluctant to discuss the perils of combat, Behr does not wish to highlight his warzone activities. He does, however, say the experience has, without question, changed him forever.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI value relationships more than I ever did previously,\u201d Behr said.\n\nThis story was first published in 2017.", "description": "A distant, flashing image of blue sky, rolling mountains and snowy rivers visited itself upon an injured soldier having narrowly escaped death in a violent firefight on the ground below \u2013 just barely beyond view from the naked eye.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/DillonBehr.jpg"}
