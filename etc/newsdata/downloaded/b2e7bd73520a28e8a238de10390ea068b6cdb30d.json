Kourtney revealed that she no longer had a nanny for 7-year-old Penelope after the little girl apparently scratched and bit her previous nanny.\n\n\"P can be out of control,\" Kourtney revealed. \"I think she blacks out and does these things.\"\n\nIn response, Corey asked if she felt it was okay to hit Penelope when she was acting out like that, which was a suggestion Kourtney strongly rejected.\n\n\"No, but you could also say something to her, in the moment,\" Kourtney offered.\n\nThe conversation regarding ways to appropriately curb Penelope's behavior in the future was already tense, but things reached a real boiling point when Corey said, \"If P scratch me, I\u2019m whipping her a**.\"\n\nThe words shook and angered Scott, who asked, visibly upset, \"My daughter? My little daughter?!\u201d\n\nCorey stood by his stance, saying he'd give Penelope \"a spanking for sure,\" and that \"whippin\u2019 is that discipline!\"\n\nAs Kourtney, Kim and Kris sat around the table quietly, Scott yelled, \"Don\u2019t ever talk about a child like that!\"\n\nCorey became increasingly more incensed, yelling, \u201cMotherf**ker, what you talking about?!\u201d\n\n\"Get the f**k outta here!\" Scott yelled back, after standing up from the table.\n\nThe tension around the table continued to grow as the talk about disciple went on, until Corey asked, \"If your kid scratched me in the face, you don\u2019t think they deserve to be popped?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Kourtney shot back.\n\nEventually, Kris tried to ease the situation between her daughter and Corey, by claiming that Corey didn't mean his comments literally and would never actually hurt Penelope.\n\nIn a way, Kourtney said she agreed with her mom, explaining, \"Because he will never be with my kids alone and if he does that in front of any of us there will be a f**king issue!\"\n\nKourtney, Scott and Kim -- with Cheban in tail -- then left the dinner, leaving Kris and Corey alone, and Kris wiping tears from her eyes over the drama. It looks like this is yet another rift between her long-time boyfriend and her kids.\n\nLater in the episode, Kourtney and Corey met up again to try and talk things out, although it didn't seem to solve their problems.\n\nKourney told Corey, \"We are never going to agree,\" when it comes to how to raise or punish their kids, but that she doesn't want to not be able to bring her kids over to their grandmother's house \"because I feel uncomfortable\" with Corey around. However, Corey stressed, again, that he has no intention to \"to discipline her kids\" in any way.\n\n\"I understand how Kourtney and Scott feel but I can say what I want to say because that\u2019s my opinion,\" Corey shared in a solo interview, adding that he just feels that kids should appreciate that actions have consequences.\n\nCorey added that he hopes \"everyone can move on\" from the disagreement.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKourtney Kardashian Admits She Feels Pressure From Kylie Jenner's Billionaire Status\n\nScott Disick and Corey Gamble Get Into Shouting Match Over Corey\u2019s Threat Against Penelope Disick\n\nSofia Richie Calls Scott Disick 'Best BF' After He Surprises Her With Luxury Car on Her 21st Birthday\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "Kourtney said she doesn't feel comfortable with her kids being around her mom's longtime boyfriend following parenting fight.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R8tYAputpnGMQGELxx8rug--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/bfd8f874c40ef46e4bb28346f5ae08ba", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
