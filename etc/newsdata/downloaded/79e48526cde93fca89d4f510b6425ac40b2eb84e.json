The former European Commission spokesperson is a well-known figure in Brussels.\n\nIt\u2019s because of the name his portfolio was given by Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen. Several members of Parliament have objected that Schinas\u2019 title as commissioner for the \u201cEuropean Way of Life\u201d plays into populist rhetoric \u2014 especially since his responsibilities are to include migration.\n\nBut what is the European way of life exactly?\n\nManfred Weber, the leader of the center-right European People's Party (EPP) in Parliament defended Schinas\u2019 title as entirely appropriate, asking his fellow MEPs: \u201cIs there someone in the room who wants to live the African way of life? Or the American way of life?\u201d\n\nWhich leads to the question: What is the European way of life, really, and how does it compare to, say, the \u201cAmerican way of life\u201d?\n\nPOLITICO breaks down the numbers, with sometimes surprising results.\n\nThis infographic is from POLITICO Pro\u2019s DataPoint library.
