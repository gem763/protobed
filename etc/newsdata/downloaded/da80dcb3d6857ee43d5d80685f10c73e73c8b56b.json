And according to the data firm, the San Francisco Bay Area remains a Mecca for those trying to bring the next \u201cbig idea\u201d to life.\n\nStanford University landed in the No. 1 spot in PitchBook\u2019s report, which was conducted PitchBook by tracking the founders of companies that received a first round of venture funding between January 1, 2006 and August 31, 2019.\n\nGraduates from the elite school have raised about $37.8 billion during that period \u2014 led by companies like social media giant Snap (SNAP), and on-demand food delivery service DoorDash.\n\nThe University of California-Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and University of Pennsylvania all rounded out the top five, respectively.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a venture capitalist and you\u2019re going to try something on a young person coming from school, you hope they go to a great school,\u201d branding expert and BigEyedWish Founder Ian Wishingrad told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM.\n\nTo be certain, big name schools aren\u2019t everything. However, \u201cIf they\u2019re able to get their way to Wharton, Harvard, or Stanford that is the easiest way to mitigate risk,\u201d he added.\n\nFinding \u201crock stars\u201d\n\nWishgrad said that \u201cthese schools are great because they pull in great people\u2014like how a great director makes a good movie because he knows how to cast good people.\n\nThe more elite schools \u201cknow how to find rock stars from a young age and bring them in to help give them the tools.\u201d\n\nStanford comes in as No. 1 in PitchBook's new 2019 rankings for the top universities for entrepreneurs. Its graduates have raised $37.8B in startup capital between Jan. 1, 2006 and Aug. 31, 2019. More\n\nAnd the schools on PitchBook\u2019s rankings extend far beyond the ivory tower. The University of Texas comes in at No. 9 with alumni, including Niantic\u2019s CEO \u2014 best known as the developer of Pok\u00e9mon GO.\n\nThe University of Illinois finishes out the top 10, which has produced the founders of startups like the biotech firm Grail, which is making major strides in cancer screening.\n\n\u201cIt shows how important brand and provenance really is,\u201d Wishingrad said about universities attracting young visionaries to their schools.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a referendum with college debt. All the weak [college] brands will all fall away. But these brands are going nowhere, and they\u2019ll mean more than ever.\u201d\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "PitchBook released its new 2019 rankings for the university programs that produce the most entrepreneurs who go on to score venture capital funding.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6p4FLR9E6AvJKtN0kI9cZg--~B/aD0zMDI1O3c9NTM3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/48114f70-d4f9-11e9-b275-87c1bdcb3d8d", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
