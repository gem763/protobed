But while I\u2019m still figuring out how I feel about having a howling, fire-haired general accompanying my tiny troops into battle, I\u2019m already certain I\u2019m in love with another new feature: jail.\n\nIn real life, jail is bad, and the prison-industrial complex should be abolished. In Dota Underlords, however, it\u2019s a grand old time. Or, as a weird little raven man in the game enthusiastically puts it: \u201cExtrajudicial imprisonment is a daily part of White Spire life!\u201d Here\u2019s how it works: Every day, a selection of 8 to 12 heroes gets put in jail, meaning that they can\u2019t be used in matches. This serves multiple purposes. For one, it leaves space for Valve to add new heroes without destroying any chance that people will draw enough of a single hero to level them up, or enough heroes from a particular alliance to complete that alliance and gain its mid-battle bonuses. For two, it keeps things fresh: The meta can\u2019t calcify around a single strategy if the hero selection is changing slightly every day.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting, albeit risky approach. I can see people getting angry on days when their favourite heroes are disabled. On top of that, worst case scenario, instead of one dominant meta, we just get a series that people cycle through.\n\nToday\u2019s jailed Dota Underlords heroes\n\nStill, I really like the idea, and I absolutely adore its presentation. The jail screen includes short descriptions of why each hero got unceremoniously tossed in the slammer, and some of them are absolute gold. Today, for example, Crystal Maiden is in because she \u201crefused to pay Anessix\u2019s secret tax,\u201d Sand King is in because he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell [a] cute dog that it was a good boy,\u201d and Io, an ethereal ball of light, is doing time for \u201cpublic lewdness.\u201d\n\nLargely, the explanations are funny, but the first one theoretically sets up a fun dynamic between a hero and Anessix, an Underlord, and I could see characters being given more colour through this system in the future. Sometimes, a little bit of clever writing goes a long way.\n\nAs for the rest of the update, I\u2019ve only gotten to play a couple matches, so I\u2019m still on the fence. There\u2019s a new interface that I\u2019m having trouble getting used to, and I\u2019ve yet to get much time with the new heroes and alliances. Underlords\u2014individual units that join you on the battlefield and gain new abilities as matches progress\u2014are clear game-changers, but I don\u2019t know exactly how much they\u2019ll shake up the game yet. If nothing else, the new duos and freestyle modes seem like neat additions. I plan to play more soon, and I\u2019ll report back with my impressions.", "description": "Today, Valve\u2019s ever-evolving auto-battler received its long-awaited \u201cBig Update,\u201d aka the one that finally adds Underlords to Dota Underlords.
