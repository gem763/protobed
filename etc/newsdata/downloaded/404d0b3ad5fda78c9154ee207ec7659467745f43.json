While other countries are free to enhance their defenses, Russia and the US have tied their own hands with this treaty.\n\nHowever, Putin pointed out that \u201cit was not worth ruining the deal,\u201d which helped the US and Russia by precluding the fielding in Europe of ground-based missiles with a range of between 500km and 5,500km, and which remained the cornerstone of security on that continent since 1987. \u201cI believe there were other ways out of the situation,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia offers NATO a moratorium on missile deployment, but won\u2019t sacrifice its own security to prove its goodwill\n\nThe New START Treaty, which came into effect in 1994 and limits the number of strategic nuclear missile launchers possessed by the two countries, is the final element that could \u201cprevent us from falling back into a full-scale arms race,\u201d Putin warned.\n\nThat deal expires in 2021 and, \u201cto make sure it is extended, we need to be working on it right now,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if an arms race couldn\u2019t ultimately be avoided, the President assured interviewers that \u201cRussia will be the least affected party because\u2026 we already have the next generation of weapons, and these are unprecedented, with unmatched capabilities. We have done our homework. We do not need to rush now and can calmly think of what can be done next.\u201d\n\nAn arms race is a bad thing, and it will not be good for the world. However, we will not be dragged into exorbitant budget-spending games.\n\nThe reason for Russia obtaining those state-of-the-art weapons, despite being only sixth globally in terms of military spending \u2013 behind the US, China, Saudi Arabia, UK, France and Japan, is \u201cfocused research on priority areas,\u201d he explained.\n\nPutin himself announced a range of futuristic Russian weapons last year and caused something of a frenzy in Western media. The headline toppers were the Avangard hypersonic glider and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, which are said to be able to bypass any existing missile defense system.\n\nAlso on rt.com Russia already HAS weapons that can penetrate ANY missile defense, but their development won\u2019t stop there \u2013 Putin\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
