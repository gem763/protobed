Countries joining must be able to ensure the security of the bloc's external border - a sensitive political topic due to migration since 2015.\n\n\"The future Schengen accession of Croatia, but also Bulgaria and Romania is all the more relevant and necessary given the migratory and security challenges of today,\" Avramopoulos said.\n\nIt is a sore point for Romania and Bulgaria - members since 2010, they have yet to be granted access to Schengen.\n\nBut the issue has also divided MEPS.\n\n\"For Croatia, it's not only some kind of satisfaction. It's some kind of commitment to even upgrade what is needed to overcome its problems,\" Croatian Socialist MEP Tonino Picula said.\n\n\"I'm disappointed. I think it's a political decision and I regret that we don't discuss it with the next Commission. Looking at the reality on the ground, we don't have a full Schengen functioning - this was a bad decision,\" Slovenian Socialist MEP Tanja Fajon explained.\n\nIt is now up to the EU national leaders to decide whether or not to let Croatia join the club.", "description": "Countries and MEPs are divided as Croatia is given the greenlight to join the Schengen zone.", "authors": ["Stefan Grobe"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/06/62/1000x563_cmsv2_f92ea3b5-4ce3-5ff3-8b37-f641bd09ec23-4250662.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
