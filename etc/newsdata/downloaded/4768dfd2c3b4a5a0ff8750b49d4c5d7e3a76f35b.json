No known images of the DF-17\u2019s hypersonic glide vehicle exist in the public domain.\n\nAdvertising\n\nChina carried out the first flight-tests of a new kind of ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) in November, The Diplomat has learned.\n\nAccording to a U.S. government source who described recent intelligence assessments on the People\u2019s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) on the condition of anonymity, China recently conducted two tests of a new missile known as the DF-17.\n\nThe first test took place on November 1 and the second test took place on November 15. The November 1 test was the first Chinese ballistic missile test to take place after the conclusion of the first plenum of the Communist Party of China\u2019s 19th Party Congress in October.\n\nDuring the November 1 test flight, which took place from the Jiuquan Space Launcher Center in Inner Mongolia, the missile\u2019s payload flew to a range of approximately 1,400 kilometers with the HGV flying at a depressed altitude of around 60 kilometers following the completion of the DF-17\u2019s ballistic and reentry phases.\n\nHGVs begin flight after separating from their ballistic missile boosters, which follow a standard ballistic trajectory to give the payload vehicle sufficient altitude.\n\nEnjoying this article?

The missile is expected to be capable of delivering both nuclear and conventional payloads and may be capable of being configured to deliver a maneuverable reentry vehicle instead of an HGV.\n\nMost of the missile\u2019s flight time during the November 1 flight test was powered by the HGV during the glide phase, the source said. The missile successfully made impact at a site in Xinjiang Province, outside Qiemo, \u201cwithin meters\u201d of the intended target, the source added. The duration of the HGV\u2019s flight was nearly 11 minutes during that test.\n\nThe HGV payload that China tested in November was specifically designed for the DF-17, the source told The Diplomat, while noting that parts of the U.S. intelligence community assess that the DF-17 is heavily based on the PLARF\u2019s DF-16B short-range ballistic missile, which is already deployed.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cThe missile is explicitly designed for operational HGV implementation and not as a test bed,\u201d the source said, describing U.S. intelligence assessments of the DF-17. This was \u201cthe first HGV test in the world using a system intended to be fielded operationally,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe DF-17, per current U.S. intelligence assessments, is expected to reach initial operating capability around 2020.\n\n\u201cAlthough hypersonic glide vehicles and missiles flying non-ballistic trajectories were first proposed as far back as World War II, technological advances are only now making these systems practicable,\u201d Vice Admiral James Syring, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, remarked in June, during a testimony before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee.\n\nOutside these missiles, China has conducted seven known tests of experimental hypersonic glide vehicles. These tests took place between 2014 and 2016.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get first-read access to major articles yet to be released, as well as links to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-Pacific correspondents.

By flying at a low altitude instead of reentering from a much higher apogee on a ballistic trajectory, adversary radars would detect HGVs with less time for an interception to take place before the payload can reach its target.\n\nHGVs, however, are considerably slower in the final stages of their flight than most reentry vehicles on a ballistic trajectory. This may leave them vulnerable to interception by advanced terminal point defense systems.\n\nIn a report detailing new ballistic and cruise missile threats to the U.S. released this year, the U.S. National Air and Space Intelligence Center observed that \u201cHypersonic glide vehicles delivered by ballistic missile boosters are an emerging threat that will pose new challenges to missile defense systems.\u201d", "description": "The DF-17 is the first hypersonic glide vehicle-equipped missile intended for operational deployment ever tested.", "authors": ["Ankit Panda"], "top_image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/thediplomat/image/upload/t_td-story-s-2/f_auto/main/https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thediplomat-2017-10-11-et-si-cest-lui-le-planeur-boost-glide-chinois-df-zf-05-1.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-28"}
