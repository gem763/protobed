A decision is expected in February.\n\nThe ACCC's view is that the merger will prevent TPG from building the nation's fourth mobile network offering ultra cheap plans, and will therefore result in a substantial lessening of competition. But Ms Rowland said price competition was already healthy in the mobile sector.\n\n\"[N]o-one comes up to me raising concerns about mobile prices. And to be fair, why would they?\" she will say. \"The Australian mobile market is delivering good value and choice for consumers. Our mobile networks are ranked fourth in the world, and mobile prices, in real terms, have declined over the past decade.\"", "description": "Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland has questioned the ACCC's decision to block the merger between TPG and Vodafone Hutchison Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1874%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_13/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b62571be9fc9823dd289212c467127472bb61ab6", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
