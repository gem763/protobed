According to science \u2013 and the app\u2019s own description on the marketplace it\u2019s sold \u2013 there is no one gay gene. The only thing the \u201cHow Gay Are You\u201d app can tell you about yourself, if you buy it, is that you make very poor purchasing decisions.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to scroll past the \u201cdisclaimer\u201d to get to a chart that literally claims to show a user\u2019s level of \u201csame sex attraction\u201d\n\nYou cannot tell how gay someone is with an app that interprets DNA. Depsite the fact that \u201cgayness\u201d has been linked to genetics, there isn\u2019t a gay gene, group of gay genes, or any other method by which a person or AI could extrapolate \u201cgayness.\u201d You also cannot use AI to tell if someone is gay, that \u201cgaydar\u201d AI you read about awhile back was bullshit too. You can barely even trust self-reporting studies because it\u2019s a confusing topic \u2013 some people don\u2019t identify as \u201cgay\u201d until later in life, others identify as \u201cstraight\u201d because they don\u2019t count non-romantic same-sex sexual encounters. The point is: it\u2019s all bullshit.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s dangerous bullshit.\n\nSomeone by the name of Joel Bellenson also named as a creator of the app. His LinkedIn profile says he's based in Uganda, which is problematic in light of this news: https://t.co/ggfeDTCrCw \u2014 Emily Mullin (@emilylmullin) October 14, 2019\n\nOne Zero writer Emily Mullin pointed out that the app\u2019s alleged author appears to be located in Uganda, where \u201chomosexuality\u201d is illegal and politicians are currently trying to make it punishable by death. In other intolerant countries, such as the US, it\u2019s legal, in at least some areas, to discriminate against those who identify as, or are suspected of being queer.\n\nAnd, while there\u2019s absolutely no chance that this idiotic app can tell if anyone is gay (much less how gay someone is, ffs), there\u2019s certainly a chance that someone will believe it can, much like there will always be those who believe in \u201cLove Tester\u201d machines and tarot cards.\n\nWhile the potential danger of this app\u2019s use as a tool for discrimination is certainly bad enough, and the fact that it claims to have any informational value whatsoever makes it a scam to begin with, we\u2019d also wager it\u2019s a third-party DNA selling scam.\n\nSee, you have to get your DNA sequenced or pay the GenePlaza marketplace to sequence your DNA so that you can use this app and the dozens of other scammy apps available there.\n\nGenePlaza didn\u2019t return our requests for comment, so it\u2019s just conjecture on our part to assume it\u2019s selling DNA \u2013 the practice is incredibly common in the industry. The company has a privacy policy page that says it\u2019ll \u201cnever, ever sell your data,\u201d but it also says users agree to have their data \u201cprocessed\u201d which it defines as:\n\nProcessing: any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction; in this Policy, the terms \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201cprocess\u201d, \u201cprocessed\u201d, etc. refer to this definition.\n\nThe portion that reads \u201cconsultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available\u201d is particularly interesting.\n\nH/t: Dan Robitzki, Futurism", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgayapp.jpg&signature=3bae0dba6e5dbc99a481bdaf6dd5b8d4", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
