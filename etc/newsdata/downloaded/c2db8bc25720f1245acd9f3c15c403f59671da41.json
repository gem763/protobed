And I\u2019m losing it at the moment. I\u2019m really losing that interest, because we make no financial gains and I\u2019m keeping it open.\n\n(Image: Victoria Wilcox/Derbyshire Live)\n\n\"But now, recently, I have been thinking \u2013 is it even worth it for me to try to do everything I\u2019m doing when actually there\u2019s no financial gain from any of it?\n\n\"Put yourself in my shoes. I would love everybody to realise. I would love people to say \u2018hold on a minute. Let\u2019s stop being like this\u2019.\"\n\nAs of Monday morning, there had been 279 comments on the Derbyshire Live Facebook page under the original story , published on Friday, about Arron May and his partner's customer experience.\n\nOf those, 106 expressed an opinion on the argument. A total of 85 comments (80%) were in support of the couple, and 16 (15%) were in favour of La Pizza and Mr Palermo. The remaining five comments did not clearly take one side or the other.\n\nSome questioned whether or not Mr May and his partner could have behaved better.\n\nOn the Derbyshire Live website, a commenter with the username FuriouslyAngry said they were in the restaurant at the time.\n\nThey wrote: \"The couple seen in the CCTV had a right to be upset with the waiting time but I found their behaviour quite poor to be honest.\n\n\"From my experience the restaurant has always had good staff, but it does seem to be quite understaffed these days. The blame should be on the owner.\"\n\nIn response Mr May, of Sinfin, said he had already used privacy laws to request a copy of the CCTV from La Pizza and he claimed it would prove he was in the right.\n\nHe said of the witness's claims: \"I say that is a complete load of rubbish.\n\n\"I am trained in conflict management and have worked doors and am used to dealing with aggressive drunks. I'm so disgusted in how we were both treated as I am used to dealing with people professionally, using good customer service, which this venue clearly needs training in.\n\n\"You will probably find the commenter is a member of staff or a friend of someone in the venue.\"", "description": "The owner of La Pizza, in Derby, revealed he may permanently shut the restaurant - which has been closed since last week - because it isn't making any money", "authors": ["Chris Flanagan", "Image", "Victoria Wilcox Derbyshire Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20639330.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Derby-restaurant-boss-in-CCTV-row-with-customer-says-he-may-close-La-PizzaHe-says-it-is-not-making.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
