REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nBEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon\u2019s Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri has agreed a package of reforms with government partners to ease an economic crisis that has sparked nationwide protests, official sources told Reuters, with a cabinet meeting expected on Monday to approve them.\n\nHariri, who is leading a coalition government mired by sectarian and political rivalries, gave his feuding government partners a 72-hour deadline on Friday to agree reforms that could ward off crisis, hinting he may otherwise resign.\n\nThe decisions call for a 50% reduction in the salaries of current and former officials and $3.3 billion in contributions from banks to achieve a \u201cnear zero deficit\u201d for the 2020 budget.\n\nIt also includes a plan to privatise its telecommunications sector and an overhaul to its crippled electricity sector, a crucial demand among potential foreign donors and investors needed to unlock some $11 billion in funds to Lebanon.\n\nThe sources said the budget would not include any additional taxes or fees amid widespread unrest that were triggered in part by a decision last week to put a levy on WhatsApp calls.\n\nThe reforms also called for establishing new regulatory and transparency bodies within a \u201cshort period\u201d of time to oversee reform plans.
