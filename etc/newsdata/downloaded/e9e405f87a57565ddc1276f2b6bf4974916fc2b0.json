It connected me to my roots, reminded me that no matter how successful I was, I was still a working-class boy from a council house in Pinner.\n\nAnd I loved the club. So when the chairman offered to sell me Watford outright in the spring of 1976, I said yes.\n\nAfter matches, I\u2019d go to the Supporters\u2019 Club, meet with Watford fans and listen to what they had to say.\n\n\u2018Advice\u2019: Prince Philip\n\nI wanted them to know that we weren\u2019t taking them for granted, that without the supporters Watford was nothing.\n\nMe: Elton John Official Autobiography by Elton John is published by Macmillan on October 15, \u00a325\n\nI threw huge parties for the players and staff at Woodside, my house in Old Windsor, with five-a-side games and egg and spoon races. I bought an Aston Martin, had it painted in Watford\u2019s colours \u2014 yellow, with a red and black stripe down the middle \u2014 and drove to away games in it; I called it the Chairman\u2019s Car.\n\nI didn\u2019t realise how much attention it had attracted until I was introduced to Prince Philip. \u2018You live near Windsor Castle, don\u2019t you?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Have you seen the bloody idiot who drives around that area in his ghastly car? It\u2019s bright yellow with a ridiculous stripe on it. Do you know him?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, Your Highness. It\u2019s actually me.\u2019\n\nHe didn\u2019t appear particularly taken aback by this news at all.\n\nIn fact, he seemed quite pleased to have found the idiot in question, so that he could give him the benefit of his advice.\n\n\u2018What the hell are you thinking? Ridiculous. Makes you look like a bloody fool. Get rid of it.\u2019", "description": "SIR ELTON JOHN: Vicarage Road was five or six miles from where I was born.
