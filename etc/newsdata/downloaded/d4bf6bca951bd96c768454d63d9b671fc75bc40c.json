Blitzchung called for the liberation of Hong Kong during a post-match interview at a Blizzard-sponsored event on October 5.\n\nRead more: Here's a timeline of Activision Blizzard's terrible week, as it faces fan protests after an esports athlete was punished for voicing support for Hong Kong\n\nBlizzard initially responded by banning him from competition for one year, and saying that it would no longer work with the two commentators who conducted the interview. Days later, however, it reduced the punishment to a six-month suspension for both Blitzchung and those commentators.\n\nFans accused Blizzard of attempting to censor Blitzchung to protect its business interests in China, but the company said the punishment was about distracting attention away from the tournament, rather than the specific viewpoint he voiced. Blizzard said Blitzchung violated the rules of the competition by making political statements, and claimed that the statements damaged the company's image by offending a portion of the public.\n\nCritics have been less than satisfied with Blizzard's explanation, and online groups have been using social media to plan and carry out acts of protest against the company. At least one group is planning protests to coincide with Blizzcon, Blizzard's annual fan convention, scheduled to be held in Anaheim, California on November 1.\n\nThe Nintendo Store announced the \"Overwatch\" launch event the same day that Blizzard announced its punishment of Blitzchung. Responses to the Nintendo Store announcement were filled with messages supporting the Hong Kong protesters and calling for a boycott of Blizzard's event. Voice actors from \"Overwatch\" were scheduled to appear at the Nintendo Store for a 90-minute meet and greet session with fans, and fans were required to pre-register for the event.\n\nBlizzard did not respond to a request for comment, and has yet to offer a statement on the event's cancellation.", "description": "Blizzard had planned to celebrate the launch of \"Overwatch\" on the Nintendo Switch with a special event at the Nintendo Store in Rockefeller Plaza.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da60c4ccc4a0a11e5366684?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
