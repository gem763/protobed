Again.\n\nThe former New York mayor dipped his toes into the water in both 2012 and 2016, and backed off a 2020 race last March. Always for the same reason: He concluded he couldn\u2019t win.\n\nHe was right and many actual candidates should follow Bloomberg\u2019s example. The 12 Democrats on the debate stage last week proved that quantity does not guarantee quality.\n\nYet a new reality is prompting Bloomy\u2019s second thoughts. It is the growing likelihood that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, an extreme leftist, will win the nomination and guide the party into the political wilderness.\n\nBloomberg, a Democrat again after being a Republican and independent, regards Warren\u2019s economic plans as dangerous nonsense. He told her as much at a gun-control event he bankrolled.\n\nTaking the microphone after her, he told the audience, \u201cI just said to Senator Warren on the way out, \u2018Senator, congratulations, it\u2019s a nice talk. But let me just remind you if my company hadn\u2019t been successful, we wouldn\u2019t be here today, so enough with this stuff.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEarlier, he denounced her plan for a wealth tax, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s called Venezuela.\u201d\n\nBloomberg\u2019s reconsideration, reported by CNBC, comes with a hitch. He\u2019s said to be holding back until Joe Biden craters or quits.\n\nBig mistake because by that point, it will be too late.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Biden is an impediment to others, which is why I urged him to drop out a month ago. My point then was that no other relative centrists, including Bloom\u00adberg, would run because none could beat Biden in the primary.\n\nBut at the same time, it was already clear that the former vice president can\u2019t go the distance and win the nomination. His early \u00addebate performances were dreadful and his inability to finish a sentence without veering into gibberish is painful to watch.\n\nAnd that was before President Trump\u2019s focus on the fact that \u00adBiden\u2019s son, Hunter, made millions from foreign governments while his father was vice president.\n\nThe many blows on Joe Biden are having an impact. Warren has overtaken him in most polls and is now the party\u2019s recognized front-runner. His donors also are getting skittish, with the most recent fundraising report showing Biden trailing Warren, Sen. Bernie Sanders and even Pete Buttigieg.\n\nStill, because Dem voters are divided among the large field, Biden could limp along well into the primary season, which starts with the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3 and includes Super Tuesday just a month later.\n\nAt some point, he will collapse but there probably will not be enough time for a newcomer to get into the race and amass the delegates needed to stop Warren.\n\nWhich is why Bloomberg should take the plunge now. Later will be too late.\n\nBesides, he\u2019s 77 years old and, his megabillions notwithstanding, he\u2019s not getting any younger. If not now, when?\n\nThis is not an endorsement, certainly not for the general election. Trump\u2019s economic policies are boosting incomes and opportunities for tens of millions of people and his America First agenda is a road map for national renewal. Assuming the president stops shooting himself in the foot, he will be a formidable opponent.\n\nBut America needs two viable parties competing for many of the same voters to make our system of checks and balances a governing reality. These days, the Democratic Party is veering too far left under the leadership of arrogant coastal elites who are hostile to free speech, religion and the everyday concerns of working and middle-class citizens.\n\nThe sophomoric idiocy of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her anti-Semitic pals would be laughable if they weren\u2019t serious power players driving much of the party\u2019s agenda. Their support for impeachment helped push Speaker Nancy Pelosi down that destructive road.\n\nWarren is smarter but not ideologically different. Her claim to be a capitalist is as phony as her claim to have American Indian heritage.\n\nHiding behind a fig leaf of seeking fairness, she is fixated on taking away private health insurance and imposing massive tax hikes on individual and corporate wealth. As one of her opponents correctly charges, Warren wants to use government power to penalize and punish Americans rather than help lift them up.\n\nHer job-killing policies must be challenged by a credible candidate from within the party and Bloomberg is uniquely qualified for that role.\n\nHis three-term mayoralty was a huge success as he guided New York out of the dark aftermath of 9/11 into a new Golden Age of safety and prosperity. He is one of the great business minds of our era and his philanthropy is a model for generosity, even as much of it is directed at such political issues as gun control, abortion rights and fossil fuels.\n\nAlas, like most wealthy people who preach the evils of climate change, Bloomy\u2019s personal carbon footprint is gigantic, with mansions galore and a private fleet of aircraft.\n\nWhile Bloomberg tells friends he doesn\u2019t believe there is any place for him in the campaign, he would shake up the race and give voters a sensible alternative. He\u2019s got a team eager to go and money would be no object, allowing him to make the case that he knows how to run a government and will do for the nation what he did for New York.\n\nAs he put it in a Washington Post op-ed last week: \u201cThe presidential aspirants are not short on big ideas. But voters must demand they explain how they intend to move from proposing plans to actually implementing them, including passing them through Congress. Those who dodge the question by speaking of revolution and the bully pulpit aren\u2019t up to the job.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like a campaign speech. But it\u2019s either now or never.\n\nRUSSIA again, Hill?\n\nHillary Clinton sounds like the late Sen. Joe McCarthy. His habit of seeing communists behind every tree is echoed by Clinton\u2019s habit of accusing her opponents of working for Russia.\n\nThe 2016 loser, who still says Trump used Russia to steal the election, now accuses Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) of being \u201cgroomed\u201d by Vladimir Putin and says Green Party candidate Jill Stein is a \u201cRussian asset.\u201d\n\nBoth women fired back, with Stein accusing Clinton of slander and Gabbard calling her \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nAmen to all that.\n\nEnough of Thrive jive\n\nReader Michael Castagna is livid at the cost and uselessness of City Hall\u2019s Thrive program. He writes:\n\n\u201cThrive should set up an office in every homeless shelter, prison, halfway house, court building, hospital and any place frequented by the homeless. Every precinct should have a contact person for a Thrive agent.\n\n\u201cUntil then, stop spending money to \u2018have a conversation.\u2019 And stop pretending to care about the mentally ill.\u201d", "description": "The former New York mayor dipped his toes into the water in both 2012 and 2016, and backed off a 2020 race last March.
