In their eyes, if the CDU/CSU had only been more conservative on questions of minority rights, gender equality and immigration, it could have obstructed the AfD at the outset. This narrative is not limited to Germany: It has become a widespread way of looking at the current transformations of European politics.\n\nAs intuitively appealing as this narrative is, it stands against much of the empirical evidence and social science work that has been done to systematically investigate this question. Accommodating the radical right is a double-edged sword as it is unclear how many voters established parties can actually win back with these strategies. More worryingly for European democracies, there is reason to believe that accommodation might even strengthen the radical right in the long run.\n\nOver the past 30 years, center-right \u2014 and also center-left \u2014 parties in western Europe have become increasingly right-wing on questions of immigration and have more generally adopted some positions from the radical right. In Germany, for example, the governing parties have passed several measures making asylum policies more restrictive since 2015. A recent analysis ahead of the upcoming Austrian parliamentary elections shows an overlap in positions of 81 percent between the Chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u2019s center-right Austrian People\u2019s Party and the radical-right Freedom Party of Austria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet these trends have clearly not prevented the growth of the radical right. Across much of western Europe, radical-right parties are doing better than ever. Since many voters of the AfD and other such parties are dedicated supporters that could never imagine voting for another party, established parties struggle to win many of them over even with a turn to more nationalist policies. As the former leader of the National Front Jean-Marie Le Pen has famously put it, \u201cVoters always prefer the original to the copy.\u201d But there is also a more troubling trend at play.\n\nIn a joint research project, Denis Cohen, Werner Krause and I investigated the effects of accommodating radical-right parties for more than a dozen Western European countries since the 1990s. Our recent working paper, which combines election study data on vote switching with data on party positions, finds no evidence that the radical-right vote share is reduced when established parties choose more anti-immigrant positions. If anything, the radical right is the net winner of the intensified competition over the same pool of voters.\n\nThis is supported by research showing that, when mainstream parties emphasize topics and employ frames that are associated with the radical right, they bring more attention to these topics \u2014 attention that generally benefits the very parties they seek to defeat. For example, radical-right parties benefit from higher attention to the issue of immigration, especially if voters see it through a frame of security. This means that established parties that accommodate the positions and rhetoric of the radical right actually bring them into the mainstream. This legitimization allows the radical right to appeal to new segments of the electorate and takes away the social stigma associated with activism on its behalf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt might be tempting for establishment parties to believe the only way to defeat the radical right is to shift away from centrist and progressive positions. But calls to counter its rise with more authoritarian and nationalist positions are misguided. The hard truth is that short-term policy shifts are unlikely to weaken radical-right parties such as the AfD.\n\nInstead, those interested in promoting liberal and democratic societies should shift the discourse away from the radical-right playbook. Politicians should stand up against the racism, sexism and homophobia promoted by these parties and should emphasize how these parties fail to provide solutions to the pressing policy questions of our time. In the long term, parties must address the increasing inequalities produced by the socioeconomic transformations of our time \u2014 inequalities that will not be solved by adopting policies from the radical right.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConstanze Stelzenm\u00fcller: Merkel\u2019s coalition is safe \u2014 for now\n\nBoris Reitschuster: A killing in Berlin raises uncomfortable questions about Germany\u2019s relationship with Vladimir Putin\n\nTarik Abou-Chadi: No, America.
