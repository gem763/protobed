That was a remark made in humour,\" Stanley Johnson told Britain's Press Association at the event.\n\n\"Don't forget we grew up in the country,\" he added. \"Nature is in our blood.\"\n\nExtinction Rebellion wants governments to adopt policies that cut harmful emissions to a net level of zero by 2025.\n\nBritain has set itself the target of 2050.", "description": "Climate protesters from Extinction Rebellion have vowed to \"occupy and shut down\" a London airport that connects to the British capital's global financial hub.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9458/665d4b84cc644cf6a037d4fde75070ef.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
