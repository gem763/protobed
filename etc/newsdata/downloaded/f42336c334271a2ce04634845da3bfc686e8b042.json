That improvement is very significant,\" Ms Emmett said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is consistent with the fact that we\u2019re not just seeing this turnaround in price, but seeing a pick-up in housing finance. It does look as if finance is becoming a little bit easier to get.\"\n\nThe improving residential sentiment also meant that separate figures earlier this week showing a 1.1 per cent decline in new dwelling approvals may be overstating the true picture. This, combined with the post-election rise in housing prices and auction clearance rates, could stimulate new housing, she said.\n\n\"It suggests the outlook is a bit more promising than the building approvals numbers are pointing to,\" Ms Emmett said.\n\n\"Hopefully that will flow into the construction sector.\"", "description": "But a rise in residential sentiment suggests fears about housing supply may be overblown.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3822%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_82%2C$y_89/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/af03bd30428baafa4bb1ba743ed1c2d9be454fca", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
