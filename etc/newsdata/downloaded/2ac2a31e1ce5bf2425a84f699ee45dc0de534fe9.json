After lengthy waiting lists and being pushed from pillar to post, I\u2019d resigned myself to never knowing why Archie was struggling. But they were also tears of fear. Like any parent in my situation, I instantly worried about what happens next and how my child would cope.\n\nThis year Archie started senior school, which requires him to catch two separate trains each day. My son\u2019s aspirations for secondary school are the same as any other child: to make friends, learn new things and do all the normal things kids his age want to do. But with autism, something as simple as a disruption on the journey to or from school can have a huge impact, turning his world upside down. It\u2019s something that many people, including myself as his mother, find hard to comprehend.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Disability History Month: Barnardo\u2019s unseen 125-year-old photos 1/8 William Large was admitted in 1888, aged around seven and a half. His mother had died of tuberculosis the previous year, and his father was sent to the workhouse. According to records, the father\u2019s \u2018carelessness and cruelty to the child have caused the hip disease with which the little one is afflicted\u2019. William was also deaf and had tuberculosis. He was trained within the print school at Stepney, and was able to secure employment as a printer in 1899 Barnardo\u2019s 2/8 Fred Forty was born in 1875 in Cheltenham, into a \u2018wretched home\u2019. His mother died of tuberculosis, and his father, a shoemaker, was described as \u2018drunken and totally unconcerned with his six children\u2019. Fred had at least two operations on his cleft palate which were unsuccessful, and had only one eye as a result of an accident. He was admitted in 1888, aged 13. Fred died in 1895 and is buried at Tower Hamlets cemetery Barnardo\u2019s 3/8 Kate McLoughlin was born in 1882 in Nottingham, and was admitted to Barnardo\u2019s at the age of seven by the local vicar. Her father had been in prison several times, and was in jail at the time. The family of five lived in one room which the local vicar described as, \u2018the most utter squalor and filth\u2019. It was \u2018the very worst home\u2019 he knew in his parish. Kate\u2019s mother battled alcoholism, and while she was out drinking, her first child drowned in a bucket of water, and another was seriously burnt. When Kate was just a baby, she fell out of her mother\u2019s arms, and subsequently suffered hip disease and deformity. After care and training in the homes, she went into domestic service in 1905 Barnardo\u2019s 4/8 Alfred Smith was born in 1875 in the town of Rugeley, Staffordshire. His father died of diabetes nine years later, leaving seven children. His mother was unable to work due to abscesses on her legs, and was receiving parish relief. Alfred had his right leg amputated when he was just 13. Two years later, he was admitted to the homes, and received an apprenticeship in the Tailors workshop. In 1895, he was working as a tailor in Surrey Barnardo\u2019s 5/8 Thomas Marks was born in Rhymney, Caerphilly, in 1885. He was orphaned at a young age when both parents died as a result of heavy drinking. When Thomas was just eight, he \u2018had both his legs cut off from the trunk by an engine running over him\u2019. Despite this, he managed to scrape a living on the street as a pickpocket until he was admitted to Barnardo\u2019s at the age of 15. He was given an apprenticeship in the tailoring workshop and subsequently found employment as a tailor on leaving the homes. By 1899 he had his own business in Wales Barnardo\u2019s 6/8 Herbert Harris was admitted in March 1892 aged 18. His father died from tuberculosis three months after Herbert was born and his mother remarried a porter who worked at the Millwall Dock Company. Herbert was working at paper mills in Millwall when both his hands were drawn into some machinery. He spent three months in hospital where his arms needed to be amputated \u2013 one above, the other below the elbow. His mother received \u00a350 from Herbert\u2019s employer which was used to stock her shop. The admission report says that it appears that none of the money was spent on behalf of the boy, apart from buying a barrow for him on which he might sell fruit. Herbert\u2019s aunt claimed his mother and her husband brutally ill-treated him, that the husband had severely beat both Herbert and his mother. And in his admissions report, was described as, \u2018civil-mannered\u2019 and \u2018in great fear of his mother and her husband\u2019. Herbert died in August 1896 and is buried in Tower Hamlets cemetery Barnardo\u2019s 7/8 Elizabeth Lines was born in 1884 in Deptford, London. Her father died of tuberculosis three years later. A fall during infancy is believed to have caused abscesses on her knee-joint, which made it necessary to amputate her leg when she was just 19 months old. She was admitted aged eight, and received training which helped her secure work as a dressmaker in Port Talbot by 1905 Barnardo\u2019s 8/8 Alfred Collings was born in November 1895 in Plymouth and admitted in January 1905 aged nine. His father died from pleurisy and pneumonia in 1901, with his mother receiving \u00a310 insurance money. Soon after the death Alfred suffered a fall which led to the bone in his foot becoming diseased. Unfortunately the problem wasn\u2019t identified or treated for a long time and eventually the parish doctor ordered him to the infirmary, where his foot was amputated. The admission report says: \u2018Alfred is of a specially bright, lively and mischievous disposition and has been petted and spoilt by the men in the infirmary. He was perpetually playing pranks\u2019 Barnardo\u2019s 1/8 William Large was admitted in 1888, aged around seven and a half.

The schemes can not only help people like my son with autism but also elderly passengers with conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe card is intended to support passengers by asking others to have patience, whereas the sunflower lanyard is a way to indicate to transport staff that the passenger has a hidden disability. Staff can also wear a badge to indicate they are aware of the scheme and have received specialist training to better understand what might be needed of them.\n\nJust like Archie, every morning is different for me when I wake up, depending on how I feel about his needs. Now I feel better knowing that my child\u2019s commute to and home from school is safeguarded even further. I know that someone is around who understands the need to take the extra minute in case Archie is having issues, as well as the correct way to approach him and try to calm him down. It helps him, and it helps my day get off to a better start.\n\nMy job at work now is to pilot both schemes at my company, Southeastern, to get a clear indication for how they work and ensure training is completely up to scratch before rolling them across the 176 stations and 540 miles of railway network that we operate.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what you can do when you have a passion to positively effect change for the ones you love. I hope that this work, and these initiatives, will give the same peace of mind to others.\n\nNatalie Leister is an area manager for Southeastern railway.
