Global trade growth has come to a near standstill.\u201d\n\nIn the so-called \u201ccurtain-raiser\u201d speech previewing the global outlook, Georgieva said the IMF now expects growth this year to fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade. The global monetary body also anticipates a slowdown in nearly 90 percent of the world.\n\n\u201cThere is a serious risk that services and consumption could soon be affected,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the fractures are spreading.\u201d\n\nIn total, she said, the cumulative effects of trade conflicts could mean a loss of $700 billion by 2020, or about 0.8 percent of the total GDP. That\u2019s about the size of Switzerland's entire economy.\n\nAnd because of historically low, or even negative interest rates, the IMF sees investors taking increased risks across the globe, creating even more financial vulnerabilities. If the slowdown evolves into a major downturn, corporate debt at risk of default would spike to $19 trillion, above levels seen during the financial crisis. That represents about 40 percent of the total debt in eight major economies.\n\n\u201cMonetary and financial policies cannot do the job alone,\u201d she said. \u201cFiscal policy must play a central role.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 26234.42 -243.60 -0.92% SP500 S&P 500 2901.26 -37.53 -1.28% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 7852.105305 -104.19 -1.31%\n\nGeorgieva's speech comes on the heels of a slew of bad economic data in the U.S. last week, including the worst manufacturing reading in 10 years, a signal that generally precedes recessions.\n\nDespite that, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell maintained that, despite some long-term risks such as low inflation, the U.S. economy remains healthy.\n\n\"While not everyone fully shares economic opportunities and the economy faces some risks, overall it is -- as I like to say -- in a good place,\" Powell said. \"Our job is to keep it there as long as possible.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' Jennifer Schoenberger contributed to this report.", "description": "The global monetary body also anticipates a slowdown in nearly 90 percent of the world.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Manufacturing-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
