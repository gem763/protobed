Once heralded for its hip take on shared office space, WeWork has fallen far and fast and would run out of money by November without new financing, CNBC reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJapanese conglomerate SoftBank will try to arrest the company\u2019s free fall as it is expected to take over Tuesday in a deal that would value the company at roughly $8 billion, the Journal reported. That\u2019s just a fraction of WeWork\u2019s highest valuation (which Neumann once said was based more on \u201cenergy and spirituality\u201d than revenue) and less than half of what it had expected from its bungled IPO.\n\nWeWork and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nWeWork\u2019s prospectus, which was filed in August, rapidly deflated the company\u2019s image when it revealed that the company was hemorrhaging money, having lost more than $900 million in the first six months of 2019. It has never turned a profit. The filing also revealed Neumann had borrowed hundreds of millions against his stock holdings and holds stakes in multiple companies that own properties leased to WeWork, prompting allegations of self-dealing that are worrisome to investors. Neumann was even paid nearly $6 million by WeWork for the trademark rights to the word \u201cWe\u201d during the company\u2019s rebranding. (He later paid the money back, the company said in an updated filing.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 40-year-old Neumann easily fit the bill of Silicon Valley disrupter. A towering 6-foot-5, he was known for walking around the office barefoot and encouraging the free flow of tequila. His goals were wide-ranging and unbounded by reality \u2014 becoming the world\u2019s first trillionaire, taking WeWork to Mars, living forever, being Israel\u2019s prime minister or \u201cpresident of the world,\u201d according to reporting from the Journal.\n\nNeumann moved to the United States in 2001 after a stint in the Israeli navy and studied business at Baruch College in New York City. His last business venture before founding WeWork was a failed baby clothes company called Krawlers that made pants with knee pads for cushier crawling. In 2008, Neumann teamed up with an architect, Miguel McKelvey, to lease vacant space in the building they worked in and turn it into a hip, eco-friendly co-working space. The business grew into WeWork, which has pegged its brand to the notion that work is the axis of life.\n\nAD", "description": "The founder and ousted CEO is stepping down from WeWork\u2019s board.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/iu7SsJNHKMEg9VVMiJ_3ocuhe7s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLEYFOXUJMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
