While no Democrats voted for Trump\u2019s law, a number agreed with Republicans that the 35 percent rate was too high.\n\nBut in recent weeks, some Democratic candidates across the ideological spectrum have suggested that the rate should once again be 35 percent.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegWatch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Michael Moore praises O'Rourke on gun reform Buttigieg releases plan to reform criminal justice system MORE last weekend called for restoring the corporate tax rate to where it was before the GOP tax law was enacted, in order to pay for his \u201cMedicare for All who want it\u201d health-care plan.\n\nHe said on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that his health plan \u2014 which would automatically enroll people without health insurance but allow those with coverage through their employers to keep it or join a government plan \u2014 is estimated to cost about $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Buttigieg said $1.4 trillion of the cost could be paid for by going back to the pre-Trump level.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of that can be recovered by rolling back the corporate tax rate cut portion of the Trump tax cuts,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nWhen the Joint Committee on Taxation scored the final version of the Trump tax law ahead of its passage, it estimated that the law\u2019s corporate rate cut would reduce federal revenue by $1.35 trillion over 10 years.\n\nButtigieg's campaign said that the candidate is planning to release an international tax plan in the future to address concerns about corporations moving earnings overseas.\n\nButtigieg\u2019s comments come after Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersHarris reverses course, attends South Carolina justice forum Watch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Michael Moore praises O'Rourke on gun reform MORE (I-Vt.) earlier this month called for raising the corporate tax rate to 35 percent as part of a broad corporate-accountability platform.\n\nIn addition to the corporate-rate increase, Sanders is calling for eliminating many tax preferences for corporations, taxing U.S. companies\u2019 domestic and foreign earnings at the same rate and taking other steps to prevent the use of offshore tax havens. He is proposing to use much of the revenue raised by his proposed corporate-tax changes to help fund his Green New Deal plan to combat climate change.\n\nIt\u2019s notable that Buttigieg and Sanders have floated the same corporate tax rate because on many other issues, Buttigieg is running as a centrist to Sanders. The Vermont senator describes himself as a Democratic socialist and has offered a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d single-payer health plan that eliminates private insurance.\n\nBesides Buttigieg and Sanders, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Bill de BlasioDNC toughens qualification criteria for December debate NYPD, de Blasio contradict Trump lawyer: President would be charged if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue New York City police officers to get free mental health care as department faces rise in officer suicides MORE (D) had proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 35 percent before he dropped out of the presidential race. De Blasio positioned himself as a progressive.\n\nSeveral other moderate Democratic presidential candidates have proposed raising the corporate tax rate more modestly. For example, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenDuring deposition, official says he made several efforts to advocate for Marie Yovanovitch Bolton looms large as impeachment inquiry accelerates Giuliani associate used small town in Ukraine to gain influence with American figures: report MORE and former Texas Rep.

Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenHarris reverses course, attends South Carolina justice forum Watch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Maher: The Clintons need to 'go away' for 2020 election MORE (D-Mass.) has said that she wants to reverse Trump\u2019s tax cuts for corporations and has called for a 7-percent surtax on corporate profits above $100 million but hasn\u2019t explicitly said what she thinks the corporate tax rate should be.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisHarris reverses course, attends South Carolina justice forum Watch live: 2020 Democrats speak at criminal justice forum Michael Moore praises O'Rourke on gun reform MORE (D-Calif.) has also talked about wanting to undo Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations and has said that she wants to tax foreign and domestic income at the same rates but hasn\u2019t provided many other details about how she wants to change the corporate tax system.\n\nMany economists and policymakers across the ideological spectrum had thought that the U.S. corporate tax rate was too high when it was at 35 percent, because that rate was among the highest in the world.\n\n\u201cI think most economists would agree that raising the U.S. corporate tax rate back to 35 percent is not a good idea,\u201d said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which is led by a former Obama administration tax official. \u201cWhen the U.S. rate is so far out of whack with the rest of the world, all you\u2019re going to get is opportunities for avoidance and evasion.\u201d\n\nDuring his presidency, Obama proposed cutting the corporate tax rate to 28 percent while also curbing business tax breaks and establishing a minimum tax on U.S. companies\u2019 foreign earnings.\n\nConservative organizations and business groups have been warning against raising the corporate tax rate.\n\n\u201cProposals to raise taxes carry harmful consequences for all Americans,\u201d the RATE Coalition \u2014 a pro-corporate tax cut group of businesses that includes AT&T, Ford and The Home Depot \u2014 said in a statement.\n\n\u201cTax hikes on American workers and job creators would crush our booming economy, increase unemployment, and reverse wage growth,\u201d the coalition added. \u201cA globally uncompetitive tax rate would move America backward.\u201d\n\nBut some progressive economic policy experts think it would be reasonable to raise the corporate tax rate back to 35 percent.\n\nIn their new book, University of California, Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who produced revenue estimates of Sanders and Warren\u2019s proposed wealth taxes, float an effective U.S. corporate tax rate of 30 percent, which is equivalent to a 35 percent statutory federal rate plus state corporate taxes. They also float a 25 percent country-by-country minimum tax. They suggest that these changes could be part of a way to pay for universal health care and education.\n\nSaez and Zucman argue in their book that globalization isn\u2019t preventing countries from having high corporate tax rates, and that even if only some countries start coordinating with each other, they can better curb corporate tax avoidance.\n\nMichael Linden, executive director of the progressive Groundwork Collaborative, said it makes sense to think about returning to a 35-percent corporate tax rate. He argued that there\u2019s no evidence that the pre-Trump tax law rate was impacting job creation and wages, and also said that the rate cut under Trump\u2019s law didn\u2019t do anything except \u201cpad the bottom line of the owners of these companies.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats are divided on the extent to which the corporate tax rate should go up, it\u2019s not surprising that the party's presidential candidates across the ideological spectrum are interested in raising the rate, given that they will need to raise revenue to offset the costs of their spending plans.\n\nProposals to raise the corporate tax rate are likely to be a political winner for Democrats. Trump\u2019s tax law never became overwhelmingly popular, particularly because voters viewed it as disproportionately beneficial to corporations and high-income taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe public wants to raise taxes on corporations as much as they want to raise taxes on rich people,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund.", "description": "Interest is growing among 2020 Democrats in raising the corporate tax rate back to the level where it was prior to President Trump\u2019s tax-cut law.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tax_sandersbernie_buttigiegpete_102519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
