(\u201cNYPD Blue\u201d previously held the record, scoring 27 nominations in 1994.)\n\nBut besides Peter Dinklage picking up his fourth trophy for Outstanding Supporting Actor, the fantasy smash was iced out of the other major categories. Despite Sophie Turner, Lena Headey and the rest of the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d women dominating the supporting actress nominations, Julia Garner of \u201cOzark\u201d ultimately walked away with Emmy gold.\n\nAnd the series got no love in the directing and writing categories for a drama series, with \u201cOzark\u201d and \u201cSuccession\u201d netting the big prizes.\n\nHBO Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in final season of \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nOver the course of its run, the HBO drama became the most nominated drama series of all time and, even before Sunday night, it had won more Emmys than any other narrative series. So it was all but certain that its final Emmy ceremony would be a \u201cThrones\u201d-esque bloodbath.\n\nThe series was already off to a roaring start this year, having won 10 of the 18 awards it was up for at the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend. Despite much fan derision, the dimly lit but massively watched third episode of the eighth season, \u201cThe Long Night,\u201d which featured the epic showdown at Winterfell between the armies of the living and the dead, had nabbed five trophies.\n\nWhile \u201cThrones\u201d reigned supreme during Sunday\u2019s telecast, fans of the popular series based on the George R.R. Martin books of the same name had earlier raged against its ending, with more than 1 million people signing a petition asking HBO to remake the final season.\n\nIn July, after weeks of silence, HBO programming chief Casey Bloys said the viral petition was never \u201cseriously considered.\u201d He did, however, thank fans for their \u201centhusiasm and passion\u201d for the show,\u201d which pushed the network ahead of competitor Netflix this year: Netflix scored a hefty 117 nominations, but HBO racked up 137 nods.\n\nAnd with two prequel series set in the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d universe already in development at the network, expect HBO to keep the torch lit at the Emmys for years to come.", "description": "HBO's fantasy juggernaut stands as the most-awarded narrative series in the history of the Emmys.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d83a732240000f64a7e7edd.jpeg?cache=zprxbqdl1l&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
