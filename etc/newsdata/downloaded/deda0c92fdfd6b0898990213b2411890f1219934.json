Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the whistleblower, whose identity has not been made public, wants to appear before the House Intelligence Committee, which Schiff chairs. No timeline for that has been announced.", "description": "Walsh, a 2020 GOP presidential hopeful, slammed Trump's alleged request for election help from Ukraine.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e6b271e0000300074a9c5.jpeg?cache=oexy3wds2e&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
