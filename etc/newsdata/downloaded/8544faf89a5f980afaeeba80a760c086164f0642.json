(Photo: Knightscope)\n\nIf there was an emergency and you saw a police robot patrolling the area, a reasonable person would expect that simply pushing its emergency alert button would call for help. That\u2019s what a California woman reportedly tried to do. In reality, the robot told her to get out of the way and carried on with its business.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Cogo Guebara noticed the police robot when a fight broke out in the parking lot of Salt Lake Park. However, despite pressing the emergency alert button multiple times, the robot merely asked Guebara to step aside and continued to scoot along its preprogrammed path, occasionally telling people to keep the park clean. Ultimately, someone had to call the emergency hotline the old fashioned way and fifteen minutes later, a woman involved in the fight was rolled out on stretcher with a bleeding cut on her head. Cool.\n\nThe robot in question is the HP RoboCop \u2014 a Dalek-shaped security robot that happens to have the word \u201cPOLICE\u201d emblazoned on its body. It\u2019s operated by Knightscope, a company whose useless security bots are famous for multiple goofs, including clobbering a toddler and falling into a fountain. Normally, Knightscope robots are limited as a form of mall cop. In this instance, the HP RoboCops are part of a pilot program with Huntington Park\u2019s police department \u2014 hence why it\u2019s labelled as POLICE in the first place.\n\nLook at this useless turd, rolling in the wind. (Photo: Knightscope)\n\nSo why was the RoboCop so friggin\u2019 useless? Apparently, the alert button doesn\u2019t actually connect to the police department just yet. Instead, the calls get redirected to Knightscope. And while it does capture live 24/7 video, the police department can\u2019t actually access those feeds either.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s confined to cement walkways, meaning it currently can\u2019t monitor anywhere beyond the north end of Huntington Park. So in summary, the HP RoboCop is a robot that can only patrol a limited area, doesn\u2019t call for help, and all the footage it captures isn\u2019t immediately accessible to the local police department.\n\nThe kicker? This useless RoboCop costs $90,000-$104,000 to lease per year. Or, the same salary as a human cop in the Huntington Park department who probably could break up a fight if needed. Area residents told NBC News that the robot\u2019s presence did make them feel safer, but given its actual uselessness, it\u2019s clear the Knightscope robots are little more than a pricey placebo. Of course, many Americans might find that\u2019s as good as the human cops that patrol their neighbourhoods and it didn\u2019t shoot anyone, so maybe it\u2019s not the craziest thing to consider using for public safety.\n\nIn general, robotics is still a nascent technology. While Boston Dynamics bots definitely represent a step forward in engineering, the cost and actual capabilities of what robots can do rarely matches what enthusiasts promise. Take companion robots. Last year, plenty of high-profile social robots were taken off the market. Despite their cuteness, functionally most weren\u2019t much better than voice assistants and cost astronomically more. As a result, their companies ran out of money as their bots failed to find a wider audience.\n\nThe HP RoboCop debacle is just another example \u2014 a troubling thought, given last year Knightscope announced a contest in the wake of the Parkland shootings. The idea was to send its K5 patrol bot to the winning school in a bid to help improve security. That\u2019s, maybe, not the most effective idea.", "description": "If there was an emergency and you saw a police robot patrolling the area, a reasonable person would expect that simply pushing its emergency alert button would call for help.
