Socialism has failed everywhere and every time.\n\nRobert Mugabe, Zimbabwe\u2019s dictator and lifelong communist, died on Sept. 6, 2019, at the age of 95. In a country where the average life expectancy was only 44 years (according to a 2006 census), he outlived most of his countrymen.\n\nHowever, his protracted and long life was constructed upon inflicting enormous and unimaginable suffering upon his people and country. For the rest of us, his incumbency should serve as a constant warning about why we should not fall for the next charismatic socialist who heedlessly promises everything.\n\nMugabe\u2019s Life Before His Dictatorship\n\nMugabe was born into poverty. Abandoned by his father at age 10, he attended a Jesuit missionary school and eventually graduated from the University of Fort Hare in South Africa, the same university Nelson Mandela attended.\n\nWhile Mugabe was receiving educator training in Ghana in the 1950s, he joined one of Africa\u2019s nationalist movements, calling for the establishment of an independent country led by the black majority in his homeland, which at the time was still a British colony. The emergence of these nationalist movements coincided with the Cold War. The Soviet Union and Communist China expanded their influence in Africa, hoping to turn former colonies into client states.\n\nMugabe was imprisoned for a decade due to his anti-government political activities, and while in prison, he was elected as the president of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). During his long imprisonment, Mugabe thoroughly studied Marxist-Leninist ideology. He became a firm believer that only socialism could save his homeland, and that only his ZANU could lead the people\u2019s revolution and bring true socialism to Zimbabwe. Therefore, ZANU must \u201calways remain in power\u201d and remain the only power.\n\nMugabe also came to see private property owners, such as the white farmers, as a threat to the socialist paradise he wanted to build. Upon his release, Mugabe led the ZANU guerrillas to fight against the white minority rule from Mozambique. Somehow, between prison and guerrilla warfare, he managed to obtain seven college degrees and was commended as an intellectual freedom fighter.\n\nIn 1979, the British government broke a Lancaster peace deal that officially ended the white minority rule and the civil war in Zimbabwe, and Zimbabwe held its first democratic election in 1980. Mugabe became the first black prime minister of Zimbabwe with an \u201coverwhelming\u201d victory. The West accepted Mugabe\u2019s legitimacy, while perversely ignoring the widely reported voter fraud and voter intimation that occurred.\n\nMugabe Was Certainly a Charismatic Politician\n\nInitially upon his election, Mugabe put on a good show. He promised the white minority in the country reconciliation and declared, \u201cIf yesterday you hated me, today you cannot avoid the love that binds you to me and me to you.\u201d His first cabinet included a former political foe and two white men. He promised his countrymen would never see violence and poverty again.\n\nIn his early years, he built schools and clinics that improved blacks\u2019 literacy rate and health. For a while, his oratory about peace and justice had many in the West fooled. Everyone thought he was another Mandela.\n\nMugabe was hailed as a liberator, knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, and even nominated with the U.K.\u2019s Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1981. Compared to other African nations, Mugabe\u2019s star power helped attract numerous foreign resources and aid to his country.\n\nUnderneath Mugabe\u2019s caring, freedom-loving facade, however, was a cruel, power-hungry, and murderous despot. Just two years into his rule, he dismissed his political opponent from the government and sent an army of former ZANU guerrillas trained by North Korea to the heartland where rival tribes resided, killing as many as 20,000 civilians, and arresting, torturing, and raping many more.\n\nHis brutal act forced his political foe to surrender, turning Zimbabwe into a one-party state. He proceeded to change the constitution to make himself president in 1987. He famously said, \u201cZimbabwe is mine,\u201d and \u201conly God who appointed me will remove me.\u201d\n\nThrough violent oppression, voter fraud, and voter intimidation, Mugabe made sure he was the only head of state in Zimbabwe after every election. He ended up ruling Zimbabwe for the next 37 years, until a military coup forced his resignation in 2017.\n\nDuring his long reign, some compared Mugabe to Adolf Hitler, a comparison he accepted with pride, saying, \u201cI am still the Hitler of the time. This Hitler has only one objective, justice for his own people, sovereignty for his people, recognition of the independence of his people. If that is Hitler, then let me be a Hitler tenfold.\u201d\n\nAs a self-proclaimed communist and socialist, Mugabe installed a socialist experiment in Zimbabwe. His most notorious economic policy was \u201cland reform.\u201d Mugabe\u2019s government, in the name of racial justice and to right historical wrongs, insisted that black Zimbabweans could only obtain equal share of land through a \u201cland reform.\u201d\n\nSo his government passed laws allowing landless black Zimbabweans to expropriate land from white farmers without compensation, and to occupy commercial farmland. The law stipulated that Great Britain should pay reparations for the land taken from the African people during its colonial rule. Women and rival tribes who backed Mugabe\u2019s political opponents weren\u2019t allowed to benefit from the \u201cland reform.\u201d\n\nGovernment-backed ZANU militias were at the forefront to enforce the \u201cland reform\u201d with violence because Mugabe told them, \u201cOur party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man, our real enemy.\u201d The Human Rights Watch documented the widespread human rights violations these militias carried out.\n\nSocialism Tanked Zimbabwe\u2019s Economy\n\nBesides the human cost, the economic impact of the \u201cland reform\u201d was disastrous. Before \u201cland reform,\u201d Zimbabwe was nicknamed the \u201cbreadbasket\u201d of Africa. Agriculture products were 40 percent of the country\u2019s exports, and the agriculture industry was the country\u2019s largest employer.\n\nThen \u201cland reform\u201d forced experienced white farmers to run away, leaving much land unattended. Inexperienced new land owners didn\u2019t know how to grow crops. Agriculture production rapidly declined. Instead of exporting produces, Zimbabweans couldn\u2019t feed themselves. Now, more than 60 percent of them rely on foreign food aid for basic survival.\n\nThe rest of the economy fell along with the agriculture industry: Banks closed, factories shut down, and the unemployment rate skyrocketed. Zimbabwe\u2019s gross domestic product per capita dropped from $1,105 in 1980 (the beginning of Mugabe\u2019s reign) to $397 in 2007. Average life expectancy dropped from 60 years in 1980 to 46 in 2007, the lowest in the world.\n\nThe Mugabe government responded to its economic woes by printing money. Its inflation rate reached 500 billion percent. Shortage of food, water, and electricity were common. Zimbabwe also experienced unprecedented health crises. About 3 million Zimbabweans (roughly a quarter of the population) fled the country. Of course, Mugabe blamed the West, the same West that has been sending millions of dollars in aid.\n\nWhile his countrymen lived impoverished and destitute, Mugabe enriched himself, his family, and his cronies. His personal wealth is estimated to have exceeded U.S.$1 billion, including a $5 million mansion in Hong Kong. His second wife, Grace Mugabe, is even known as \u201cGucci Grace\u201d because of her impossible-to-satisfy appetite for expensive European luxuries.\n\nSocialism Has Failed Everywhere It\u2019s Been Tried\n\nThe misery Zimbaweans experienced isn\u2019t new or unique. Anyone who has lived under Mao\u2019s China, Castro\u2019s Cuba, Kim\u2019s North Korea, and Maduro\u2019s Venezuela can tell you they shared similar life experiences. Mugabe wasn\u2019t the only charismatic socialist who ruined a country and the lives of millions. Socialism has failed everywhere and every time.\n\nDespite socialism\u2019s terrible record, it seems it always finds a charismatic spokesperson, whether they are old and \u201cwise\u201d or young and cute, trying to convince the rest of us to give socialism another try and promising the outcome will be different this time because the wisest leaders in history have finally arrived and are in charge to take care of us.\n\nMugabe\u2019s life should remind us not to be fooled by someone who promises to give us everything and to better our lives in every way. C.S. Lewis warned that \u201ca tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. \u2026 Those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth.\u201d\n\nMugabe certainly turned a once-prosperous country into a hell on Earth. Let\u2019s not give any socialist in our country any chance to ruin our lives.", "description": "Mugabe wasn't the only charismatic socialist who ruined a country and the lives of millions.
