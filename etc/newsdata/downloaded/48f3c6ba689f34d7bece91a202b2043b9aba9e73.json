(Robert F. Bukaty/AP)\n\nSince Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, there has been a slow uptick in Americans\u2019 reported satisfaction with how things are going in the country.\n\nYou can see that in Gallup polling. Over the course of 2008, Gallup data indicated that, on average, 15 percent of Americans were satisfied with how things were going. (Those were optimistic people, given the state of the economy at the time.) In 2009, that jumped up to an average of 26 percent, before slipping back down into the upper teens by 2011. By Obama\u2019s last year in office, the average was 27 percent, which carried into 2017, President Trump\u2019s first year in office.\n\nIn 2018, the figure was over 30 percent for the first time since 2006. So far this year, the average has fallen slightly.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThat chart doesn\u2019t tell the real story. The real story is this.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the 1990s, views of satisfaction among Democrats and Republicans generally tracked with one another. Starting in 2001, when George W. Bush became president, Democratic satisfaction tanked while Republicans remained confident with how things were going \u2014 at least until Bush was reelected. Then, the Iraq War and the economy submarined satisfaction even within Bush\u2019s own party.\n\nSatisfaction stayed low among Republicans during Obama\u2019s two terms, recovering only once Trump won. Trump\u2019s victory, though, prompted Democrats to suddenly see the direction of the country as increasingly unsatisfactory.\n\nDuring Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency, Democrats and Republicans differed in their satisfaction over how things were going by about 19 points on average. Under Bush, that gap soared to an average of 40 points. Under Trump? The average gap has been 45 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of this may look familiar if you spent a reasonable amount of time paying attention to political data. It largely mirrors another metric that is in the news more regularly: a president\u2019s job approval.\n\nClinton\u2019s approval numbers ranged from 37 to 73 points over the course of his presidency. Bush\u2019s varied from a low of 25 to a high of 90 percent after the 9/11 attacks. Obama\u2019s range was narrower, from 41 to 66 percent. Trump\u2019s has been essentially flat, no lower in Gallup polling than 36 percent and no higher than 45 percent.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nWhy? Again because of partisanship. Democrats like Trump much less than Republicans liked Clinton and even less than Republicans liked Obama. Those views have been static: Democrats have always disliked Trump and Republicans have always liked him, meaning that views of political partisans have mostly been locked in place since he took office.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nBush and Obama got honeymoon periods from the opposition (however small), and Bush had that 9/11 surge. Trump just hasn\u2019t moved.\n\nOver the course of Clinton\u2019s two terms, Gallup polling found an average spread between the parties of 55 points. During Bush\u2019s terms, the gap averaged 61 points. During Obama\u2019s, it was 71 points. So far in Trump\u2019s? The gap has averaged 79 points.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nAll of this brings us to the question we\u2019re here to answer: Does this new reality \u2014 or, really, this evolved reality \u2014 suggest that new mechanics will be in play in 2020?\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times looked at the history of successful Democratic moderates in political campaigns. Even in the 2018 Democratic wave, they argue, more moderate candidates had more success in congressional campaigns. Plenty of invisible asterisks litter the piece, but the subtext is pretty clear: Democrats will probably have better luck in 2020 if they nominate a more moderate candidate.\n\nThat\u2019s good news for the current leader in that race, former vice president Joe Biden. While his policy positions aren\u2019t exactly centrist, Biden has been overt in embracing a less-liberal agenda than his competition. He has been rewarded with strong support from moderate Democrats and has enjoyed a lead since getting into the race.\n\nThere are a lot of factors that overlap in Biden\u2019s support, so many that it\u2019s hard to suss out the importance of his more-moderate policies. That support from moderates, for example, correlates to stronger support from black Democrats who, as a group, tend to hold more moderate policy positions. Biden\u2019s position in the polls is also bolstered by the sense that he has the best chance of beating Trump in a general election, a sense that may derive in part from his taking less partisan positions on issues. It\u2019s a melange.\n\nWhat we want to evaluate is that last link: Do his more moderate positions mean he has a better chance of winning? The Times suggests sort of shruggingly that, yes, probably. Which brings us back to those graphs.\n\nDemocrats hate Trump. Not all of them, of course, but most of them. It\u2019s a large part of why there was a blue wave last year. The Times\u2019s analysis suggests that candidates who opposed Medicare-for-all \u2014 a central policy position of the more-liberal wing of the party \u2014 did a few points better than those who supported it. But it doesn\u2019t suggest that a Medicare-for-all position cost the Democrats any races.\n\nThe Post-ABC News poll released over the weekend found that Democratic primary voters are more likely to see beating Trump as important than nominating a candidate who shares their policy positions. There are gaps among demographic groups on that question \u2014 younger voters, men, nonwhite Democrats and those without a college degree are more likely to view policy positions as important. Overall, though, beating Trump takes primacy.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThere was a theory popularized by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in 2016 that went something like this: Nominate a hard-right conservative, and more-moderate Republicans would vote for that candidate anyway. But conservatives who had stayed home when the party\u2019s nominees were John McCain and Mitt Romney would surge to the polls. That theory ended up playing out to Trump\u2019s benefit, though the surge was less from traditional conservatives than more broadly disaffected Republicans. Many moderate Republicans, though, came out to vote for him anyway.\n\nThe countervailing theory to the \u201ca moderate is the safer bet for Democrats\u201d is a variant on that Cruz theory. Nominate someone who energizes less-frequent voters \u2014 like voters of color or younger people \u2014 and you\u2019ll get the same surge. Other Democrats, loathing Trump, will hold their noses if needed and vote for whichever Democrat is nominated.\n\nRemember: Most Democrats now identify as liberal. That\u2019s a shift that has been slowly happening in the party, with self-identified liberals passing moderates during Obama\u2019s tenure. More liberal policy proposals, then, probably square more solidly with the party than they once would have.\n\n\n\n(Philip Bump/The Washington Post)\n\nThe question here really comes down to energy.\n\nMillions of voters who had backed Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016, more than half of them nonwhite. Those voters were likely heavily in states that Hillary Clinton carried anyway, but the margins in states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan were so narrow that turning them out might have made the difference.\n\nOne theory of why Clinton lost, why those voters stayed home, is precisely that she didn\u2019t inspire sufficient energy with Obama voters. She, like Biden, was supported more heavily by black Democrats in the primary, but black turnout in 2016 declined from 2012. More liberal Democrats, many of whom had backed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), probably weren\u2019t as energized to support Clinton as they might otherwise have been, given her more-moderate record. Overlay expectations that Clinton would win, and you get Trump\u2019s narrow electoral college victory.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of partisan energy reflected in those graphs of satisfaction and presidential approval \u2014 often negative energy. Democrats desperately want to beat Trump. A CNN poll released Tuesday shows that independents largely oppose Trump, too: Two-thirds of independents think Trump doesn\u2019t deserve a second term, joining nine in 10 Democrats and even a fifth of Republicans. Numbers like that suggest that Trump himself may be all of the motivation needed for Democrats to win in 2020.\n\nPerhaps a moderate Democrat would fare slightly better than a more liberal one, spurring more independents to go to the polls. In an environment this polarized, though, turning out Democrats to oppose a president they despise seems like an easier prospect than historical data might capture.", "description": "Or: How much have politics shifted?", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yv-eST8gnC7uD74lKa7D6Ke5oPQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XVDJY4WR5YI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
