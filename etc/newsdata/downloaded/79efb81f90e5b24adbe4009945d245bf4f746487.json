Whether they can pick up the votes of moderate Republicans remains to be seen.", "description": "House Democrats, who have resisted a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry for weeks, are planning to hold one Thursday to lay out rules for the investigation.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/us/politics/28dc-impeach/28dc-impeach-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
