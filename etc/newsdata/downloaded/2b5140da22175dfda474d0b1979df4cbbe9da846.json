Why? A few reasons. A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\n\n\u201cWhile internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions. Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\u201d\n\nDorsey said a few exceptions would be made, citing ads in support of voter registration, and that enforcement of the new policy would begin on Nov. 22.\n\nFacebook announced a change in its own policy on Sept. 24: It would not fact-check or remove content by politicians even if the posts violate the company\u2019s rules. Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, wrote, \u201cIt is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,\u201d adding that would be done only if a politician\u2019s speech endangers people. Facebook\u2019s employees have posted op-eds arguing for the importance of free speech on their platform.\n\nDorsey\u2019s tweets announcing the new Twitter policy contained an implied rebuke of Zuckerberg\u2019s stance, which came under withering criticism in a House Financial Services Committee hearing last week.\n\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey.

And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address.\u201d\n\nBrad Parscale, President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign manager, called the move by Twitter \u201cyet another attempt to silence conservatives.\u201d\n\nIn defense of the Facebook policy, Campbell Brown, the head of news partnerships at the company and a former television news journalist, wrote in a post on the social network Wednesday: \u201cI strongly believe it should be the role of the press to dissect the truth or lies found in political ads \u2014 not engineers at a tech company.\u201d The policy has faced internal pushback from hundreds of Facebook employees who signed a letter to Zuckerberg asking him to reconsider the policy.\n\nReps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sean Casten, D-Ill., were among the legislators who criticized Zuckerberg over the policy.\n\n\u201cCould I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\u201d asked Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cIf you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI think probably.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Congresswoman, I think lying is bad,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cAnd I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad.\u201d But he said it wasn\u2019t Facebook\u2019s role \u201cto prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.\u201d", "description": "Twitter announced on Wednesday that it would no longer allow political ads on its service, in an implicit response to Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing political ads even if they contain false information.", "authors": ["Christopher Wilson", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dLbXfCoTTdp6O1TnqlFAEw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cfd107a0-fb57-11e9-9fff-f0c0e5beff08", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
