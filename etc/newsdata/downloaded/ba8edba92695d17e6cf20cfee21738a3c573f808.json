Both the rough transcript of the call and the \u201cwhistleblower complaint\u201d that supposedly resulted from it have been released, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has formally commenced impeachment proceedings against the president.\n\nBoth the transcript and the complaint are now required reading for anyone claiming to be politically informed. They raise a number of questions about the conversation and the unidentified \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d but they manifestly do not demonstrate that Trump should be impeached.\n\nRemember the running gag on Seinfeld that the whole show was about \u201cnothing\u201d? This is going to be a \u201cSeinfeld impeachment\u201d: it, too, is about nothing.\n\nRush Limbaugh was precise last week in describing the desperation and hysteria now besetting the Dems because no matter how hard they try, they\u2019ve been unable to reverse the results of the 2016 election.\n\nFirst, there was the Obama-CIA-FBI spy-op on Trump\u2019s campaign and him personally, an enormous abuse of power that was comprised of conspiracy and other criminal conduct. That resulted in the two-year Mueller investigation that came up empty.\n\nNow there\u2019s the \u201cwhistleblower complaint\u201d about Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky in which Trump is alleged to have suborned Zelensky in an attempt to \u2014 in Hillary Clinton\u2019s terms \u2014 \u201cbuy\u201d yet another government\u2019s interference in a U.S. election.\n\nEven people who should know better \u2014 such as Peggy Noonan and Chris Wallace \u2014 are saying that the transcript and the complaint are a sufficient basis to conclude that Trump\u2019s conversation with Zelensky constituted impeachable conduct. It\u2019s unfashionable to do so, but let\u2019s stick to the facts and the law.\n\nIn the conversation, Trump asked Zelensky to commence (or recommence) two investigations. The first is in aid of the ongoing Barr-Durham investigation into the abuses of power by the CIA and FBI in conducting the spy-op against Trump and his 2016 campaign:\n\nI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people \u2026 The server, they say, Ukraine has it. (Ellipses in original. According to the release, ellipses indicate inaudible content.)\n\nCrowdStrike is a cloud-based internet security firm that the DNC hired to investigate how hackers \u2014 later identified as Russian security agents \u2014 had stolen DNC and Clinton emails. Some of the computer servers from which the Russians operated to intercept the emails were (are?) believed to be located in Ukraine.\n\nTrump went on, but before he did he indicated that he was switching subjects:\n\nThe other thing. There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that, so Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\n\nIn 2018, Joe Biden bragged publicly that he told the Ukrainian government that unless a prosecutor who was investigating, among other things, the gas company Burisma, was fired, he would have withheld $1 billion in U.S. aid to Ukraine. At the time, Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, was a member of the board of directors of Burisma. Hunter Biden was hired without any expertise in Burisma\u2019s business.\n\nIn the first instance, Trump was asking for Ukrainian help in investigating the background of the \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d investigation \u2014 the spy-op that the CIA and FBI mounted against his campaign. That investigation is being conducted here by Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney for Connecticut John Durham. Trump\u2019s request is for Ukrainian help in that investigation.\n\nThat request is not only unimpeachable conduct, but it\u2019s also specifically permitted by a U.S.-Ukraine treaty signed during the Clinton administration.\n\nIt\u2019s called the \u201cTreaty with Ukraine on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters,\u201d signed in 1999 and ratified by the Senate in 2000. It requires that when a crime is committed in one country and evidence or witnesses related to the crime are in the other, the nation in which the crime was committed can request the other nation to investigate, find evidence and witnesses, and provide access to them to the nation in which the crime was committed.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written many times, the abuses of power by the CIA and FBI amount to violations of several U.S. criminal statutes, including the false statement statute (18 U.S. Code Section 1001) and the conspiring to act under the color of law to deprive Trump of his legal right to run for president (18 U.S. Code Section 242).\n\nIt\u2019s so obvious that this request by Trump was legal and appropriate that only political hacks such as Pelosi and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) Chairman Adam Schiff could miss that fact.\n\nIn the second instance, Trump asked Zelensky to look into Biden\u2019s action in demanding the prosecutor\u2019s firing in exchange for receiving $1 billion in aid. That, too, is a crime for which Biden could still be liable to prosecution. Here again, there\u2019s nothing wrong or inappropriate under the treaty about Trump\u2019s request. Just because someone is your political opponent doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s exempt from prosecution (at least unless the opponent\u2019s name is Clinton).\n\nTrump\u2019s request regarding Biden\u2019s admitted misconduct does seem politically aimed. But there\u2019s nothing in the treaty that excludes evidence of a crime because it may be of political benefit to anyone.\n\nThe problem, if there is one, is Trump\u2019s using the names of Barr and Rudy Giuliani, one of his personal lawyers, interchangeably. Then again, there\u2019s no requirement that the president pick a diplomat to perform a diplomatic mission, and there\u2019s no ban on him using his own lawyer to do so.\n\nNow, please, consider the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint.\n\nIf you read it you know that it is entirely based on hearsay. The complainant has zero direct knowledge of the facts and repeatedly makes allegations based only on information received from others.\n\nThe whole purpose of the laws protecting whistleblowers in federal agencies is to enable someone who has direct knowledge of facts that constitute a violation of law or regulation \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t trust his superiors to do anything about them \u2014 to go around the chain of command to the inspector general and possibly Congress to report wrongdoing.\n\nThe fact that Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general (IC-IG), accepted the complaint at all indicates he has a personal bias in favor of action against Trump. The complaint, which alleges actions by people outside the intelligence community \u2014 Trump and White House staff \u2014 is entirely outside his jurisdiction. Moreover, the IC-IG \u2014 shortly before the complaint was lodged \u2014 reportedly removed the requirement for personal, direct knowledge from the form on which whistleblower complaints are made.\n\nThe fact that the IC-IG labeled the complaint \u201ccredible and urgent\u201d proves that the IC-IG did so in willful evasion of the law describing his jurisdiction. Atkinson wanted Congress to create, as Pelosi and Schiff have, an uproar when the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel told the acting Director of National Intelligence that, because the president and the White House are not part of the intelligence community, he should not turn the complaint over to Congress because the law did not require him to do so.\n\nFrom these facts we have to infer that Atkinson may have either collaborated with the so-called whistleblower or was directed to so by someone higher within the CIA, such as CIA Director Gina Haspel. The IG-IC is supposedly working directly for the Director of National Intelligence. The acting DNI, Vice Admiral Joe Maguire (U.S. Navy, Retired) is someone I know to be entirely trustworthy and not at all political. (He demonstrated that last week in a HPSCI hearing chaired by Schiff.)\n\nHaspel, who is former CIA director John Brennan\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, is comprehensively untrustworthy.\n\nWhen you read the complaint \u2014 please do \u2014 you will see that it reads like a carefully prepared legal brief. I\u2019ll bet dollars to donuts that the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d (who may have been a CIA employee stationed at the White House) had a lot of help crafting it.\n\nRemember, please, the help Sen. Dianne Feinstein gave to Christine Blasey-Ford, the person who alleged sexual misconduct by Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his confirmation hearings. Feinstein reportedly found lawyers for Blasey-Ford and her staff helped prepare Blasey-Ford\u2019s testimony.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Schiff and his staff helped the whistleblower prepare his (her? their?) complaint, but it\u2019s entirely likely.\n\nThere\u2019s one allegation in the complaint that is based on something other than the facts shown in the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call. It is that the transcript of the call was placed into a standalone computer system managed directly by the National Security Council (NSC) reserved for codeword-level intelligence information.\n\nThat action was, according to the complaint, a possible abuse of the system and not the first time under the Trump administration such transcripts or recordings were placed into that system \u201csolely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information.\u201d\n\nThat allegation was enough for Schiff and other Democrats on his committee to insist that it was a \u201ccover-up\u201d to conceal that conversation in the White House system.\n\nBaloney. As you will see in reading the transcript, Zelensky said some very unkind things (but true) about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in regard to their failure to give more aid to Ukraine. This is precisely the kind of information that would embarrass Zelensky and cause Ukraine political damage. It\u2019s exactly the kind of information that should be concealed from the public and other governments.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how many presidential conversations former president Obama had that were put into that NSC system or some other such system to ensure they\u2019d be concealed. Trump should find out and tell the world how many there were, when they happened, and who was on the line.\n\nThe allegations in the whistleblower complaint and the facts shown by the transcript are nothing. There\u2019s nothing in either document to indicate Trump committed the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d that the Constitution sets as the criteria for impeachment.\n\nWhen this impeachment attempt fails \u2014 as it will \u2014 the Dems will try something else before the 2020 election. From a few reports in the Washington Post we can infer that they\u2019re preparing to say Trump is complicit in any interference in the 2020 election by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, or the Gambino crime family.\n\nMark these words: if Trump is reelected next year, the Dems \u2014 and their partisans in the intelligence community and the media \u2014 will maintain a steady drumbeat of these sorts of charges against him. Their political hysteria won\u2019t allow them to stop.", "description": "In the week since I last wrote about the accusations made against President Trump as a result of his July 25 telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a lot has happened.
