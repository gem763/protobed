It read: \"Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate.\n\nTRUMP ASKED ABOUT SHOOTING MIGRANTS AT BORDER IN LEGS IF THEY THREW ROCKS AT AGENTS, REPORTEDLY WANTED A 'TRENCH WITH DEADLY REPTILES'\n\nTrump \u2013 who mixed up The Times and the Washington Post -- said his communications staff had informed him of an excerpt from a book \u201cbeing written by Washington Post people,\u201d adding \u201cyou know its inaccurate\u201d and \u201cprobably a fraud.\u201d\n\nThe book, \u201cBorder Wars: Inside Trump\u2019s Assault on Immigration,\u201d is written by New York Times reporters Michael D. Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis. Trump even said he questioned his communications team when he was asked about details of the report, such as the wall being electrified with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh.\n\n\u201cThey came to me, the comms people, they came to me yesterday and said, \u2018Did you say this,\u2019 I said, \u2018Why are you asking that stupid question?\u2019\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cI said obviously it\u2019s fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake.\n\nTRUMP DENIES REPORT ABOUT WANTING MOAT WITH ALLIGATORS AND SNAKES AT BORDER: 'THE PRESS HAS GONE CRAZY'\n\n\u201cBecause almost everything the Washington Post does is fake. It\u2019s a fake newspaper,\u201d Trump added, while still referring to the story published in The Times. \u201cIt\u2019s owned by a rich guy for the purposes of giving him power... I call it the Lobbyist Washington Post.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond when asked if his comments about The Post also apply to The Times.\n\nTrump then reminded the reporters on hand that he had already addressed the situation on Twitter\n\n\u201cNow the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border,\u201d Trump tweeted earlier on Wednesday. \u201cI may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!\u201d\n\nIMPEACHMENT PROBE RAPIDLY WIDENS AS DEMS FIRE OFF SUBPOENAS, SET TESTIMONY\n\nTrump then called the story \u201ccorrupt reporting\u201d and declared that he had a new nickname for the mainstream media.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even use \u2018fake\u2019 anymore, I call the fake news now \u2018corrupt news,\u2019 because \u2018fake\u2019 isn\u2019t tough enough,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nDavis, one of the Gray Lady reporters involved, took to Twitter following the spray to remind Trump which newspaper she works for and to defend her reporting.\n\n\u201cFor the record, we work for the New York Times, although it's always flattering to be lumped with the great Washington Post. Neither we nor the staff there are fake news or corrupt. @shearm and I stand by our reporting,\u201d Davis wrote.\n\nFox News\u2019 Sam Dorman and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump blasted a report that said he requested a moat with alligators, snakes and an electric fence as part of the planned wall along the\u00a0southern border during a wild Oval Office spray on Wednesday - but he took aim at the wrong outlet.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
