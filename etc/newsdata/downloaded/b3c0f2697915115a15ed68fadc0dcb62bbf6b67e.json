The 7,000 square-foot house comes with 29 acres and would likely be a summer home. The family is known to have spent quite a bit of time on the island over past summers.\n\nUnlike President Trump, who earned his money before taking office, the Obamas have benefited handsomely from their time in the White House. President Obama only earned the standard $400,000 salary when he was in office, but after leaving, he and his wife Michelle acquired a joint book deal worth $65 million, high-priced speaking engagements and a deal with Netflix. Now they are rolling in dough.\n\nAs a capitalist, I am all in favor of people making as much money as they want and spending it how they please. However, this lavish new abode is quite a statement in hypocrisy from the former president, who spent his presidency demonizing everyone else's success.\n\nOBAMAS PLACED AN OFFER ON 'MEGA-EXPENSIVE' ESTATE IN MARTHA'S VINEYARD: REPORT\n\nFrom telling small-business owners they \u201cdidn\u2019t build that\u201d to the 2018 speech in which he said, \"There\u2019s only so much you can eat. There\u2019s only so big a house you can have. There\u2019s only so many nice trips you can take. I mean, it\u2019s enough,\" the former president has spent his life spreading messages that disparage success.\n\nAs many of my Twitter followers have pointed out, he must not believe in the climate change his Democratic peers are pushing. If he did, he would believe his $15 million investment on the small island will be underwater \u2014 quite literally \u2014 in just over a decade.\n\nPoliticians need to stop saying one thing while doing another. Living in a fancy house is admirable, but living in a glass house is contemptible.\n\nThe spending is perfectly aligned with the hypocrisy and envy that continues to permeate the Democratic party. Whether it is Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., with his multi-million dollar net worth and three homes or Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who earned well into the six-figures teaching at Ivy League institutions, their definition of \u201ctoo rich\u201d seems to be one dollar more than whatever they happen to be worth at a given point in time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTherein lies the rub. Too many in Democratic leadership peddle the politics of envy and victimhood to grab power, wealth and success for themselves. They indulge their followers in the lie that someone getting wealthy comes at someone else\u2019s expense. While this is offensive, it is made worse by the fact that they do it specifically for their own gain, making the political class more powerful and the government more bloated all while damaging the concept of the American Dream.\n\nI don\u2019t begrudge the Obamas for getting a nice house \u2014 even though they \"didn\u2019t build that.\" But politicians need to stop saying one thing while doing another. Living in a fancy house is admirable, but living in a glass house is contemptible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY CAROL ROTH", "description": "Obama didn't believe in owning big houses before he had the opportunity to buy one.", "authors": ["Carol Roth", "Carol Roth Is The Creator Of The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/ContentBroker_contentid-798e8caecee64437b684863823edff02.png"}
