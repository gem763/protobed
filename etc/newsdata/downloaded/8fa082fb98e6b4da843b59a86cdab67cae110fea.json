I\u2019d love a red 1984 Mercedes-Benz 380SL convertible, a white 911 Carrera from the days when Bo Jackson was the biggest sensation in sports (so \u201987 or \u201988), and I\u2019ve decided that 1986 was my personal favorite year for Chevy Silverados. For some reason, those all feel a little out of reach because of finances or simply because my wife would just say \u201cno.\u201d\n\nBut there is one car I really, truly feel like I could someday own: a Ford Bronco dressed up in an Eddie Bauer interior. I saw one a few years ago on Jalopnik with the headline, \u201cCould This Pristine 1985 Ford Bronco II Be Worth $13,700?\u201d All I could say was, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the fact that the Ford Bronco rests in my little brain as the perfect SUV. I\u2019m sure by today\u2019s standards it\u2019s a gas-guzzling money pit, but to me it represents this perfect meeting of rugged and cool, like you\u2019d expect to see one covered in mud pull up to a fancy cocktail party, and out pops some Ralph Lauren model guy; it\u2019s the SUV for every personality.\n\nEver since I first caught wind of Eddie Bauer, the company I knew from the parkas that kept me warm, working with the Ford Motor Company to make the ultimate outdoor geek dream truck, I\u2019ve had a slight obsession with similar team-ups. I never considered buying a regular Subaru, but an L.L. Bean Subaru Outback is a totally different story. The collaboration between Orvis and Jeep for that special edition Grand Cherokee that was available in the late-\u201990s is another one I have similarly warm feelings towards.\n\nAll due respect to those vehicles, even my beloved Eddie Bauer Bronco, but the one-of-a-kind epsom green 1995 Range Rover Classic that Barbour and Orvis are looking to give away is on a whole other level.\n\nInterior of the Barbour / Orvis Range Rover\n\nThe grand prize to celebrate Barbour\u2019s 125th anniversary, people can register to win the Range Rover that\u2019s valued at $125,000. With only 79,088 miles on it and new parts and modern technology added from Congleton Service, the thing will stick around for whoever is lucky enough to win. The interior is all decked out by \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Barbour. The thing is the ultimate cozy wagon.\n\nThe Range Rover, which Taylor Congleton discovered in Maine before realizing it was actually one of the first trucks he worked on when he started Congleton Service a decade earlier, took approximately 200 hours to refurbish. The end result is something so unique and cool, and you \u2014 yes, you \u2014 have a chance to win if you register between now and March 31, 2020.", "description": "For Barbour's 125th anniversary, the company collaborated with Orvis to refurbish a 1995 Range Rover Classic that somebody can win.", "authors": ["Jason Diamond"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Barbour_Landrover125_019.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
