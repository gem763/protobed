Now if viewers want TCM they have to pay an additional $9.99 for the package of channels which includes TCM.\n\nIn an explanation on its web site, Comcast posted its reasoning behind the TCM move:\n\n\u201cWe regularly review our programming and sometimes make changes to ensure we're offering a wide variety of programming at the best value. We look at a variety of factors, including customer viewership and programming costs when making these decisions. Viewership of TCM is low, as over 90% of our customers watch less than two movies per month,\u201d Comcast wrote on xfinity.com, \u201c Given this and contractual limitations on offering TCM a la carte, we decided to move TCM to the Sports Entertainment Package, which will help us manage programming costs that are passed on to our customers while continuing to make the channel available to those who want to watch it.\u201d\n\nThe move is not sitting well with Comcast customers. On xfinity\u2019s community forums dozens voiced displeasure at the move.\n\n\u201cOf course it will cost more, $9.95 more for the Sports and Entertainment package just to get TCM, what a rip-off putting a classic movie channel in with a bunch of sports,\u201d wrote a poster under the name \"crowhaven,\" \u201cI don't watch sports and I'm not paying for a bunch of useless channels to get TCM, Hulu and Netflix is sounding better all the time.\u201d\n\nThe theme of cord-cutting and turning to over-the-top services was common in the postings. \u201cI think you seriously need to reconsider this move Comcast. With cord-cutting becoming more and more common, this is not the thing to do. This will not help curb it,\u201d wrote \"tito752.\"\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % T AT&T INC. 37.47 -0.11 -0.29% NFLX NETFLIX INC. 285.53 +2.60 +0.92% CMCSA COMCAST CORP. 45.23 -0.32 -0.70% DIS WALT DISNEY COMPANY 129.70 -0.32 -0.25%\n\nThe cord-cutting wars likely loom in the background of the Comcast decision. AT&T through its WarnerMedia division owns TCM. Warner\u2019s is launching the HBO Max streaming service next spring; Comcast will be following suit with Peacock. It is expected that some TCM content will be part of HBO Max, so in the competitive streaming video game these days, helping the opposition is not seen as good business.\n\nEarlier this year, Disney and Netflix parted ways on several Marvel series such as \u201cDaredevil,\u201d \u201cLuke Cage\u201d and \u201cJessica Jones\u201d after Disney's announcement it would bring streamer Disney+ to consumers.
