In fact, there were photos posted online purportedly of Smith DJing a wedding Sunday:\n\nSmith also posted photographic evidence that shows the differences between himself and the fan:\n\n\"Our investigation of the fan incident on Sunday at FirstEnergy Stadium remains ongoing,\" the Browns said in a statement. \"While we are continuing to gather information and have been in contact with multiple people as part of that process, we have not explicitly identified the individual involved or taken any formal action of punishment at this time. We will have no further comment until the investigation is complete.\u201d\n\nRyan expressed his anger at the situation on Twitter following the game:\n\nSmith told WKYC that Browns vice president of ticket sales and service Bob Sivik refused to listen to the contention that he wasn't the fan. The WKYC report notes a few differences as well, including a tattoo on Smith's right arm that was not present on the fan throwing the beer. Smith's wife also said he's \"not that skinny.\"", "description": "The  Cleveland Browns  banned a red-haired man named Eric Smith for pouring beer on  Tennessee Titans  cornerback Logan Ryan.
