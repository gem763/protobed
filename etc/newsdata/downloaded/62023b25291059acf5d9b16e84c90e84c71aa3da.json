I kept asking questions to Malcolm while looking at flights and travel.\n\n'My brother broke down.'\n\nRoss had been keen to understand exactly what had happened so asked a friend, who was fluent in French, to contact the hospital and find out.\n\nHe discovered that Angie had suffered a bleed on the brain and he asked the doctors if they could place her on life-support so the family could say goodbye.\n\nThe request was granted and the three siblings as well as two uncles and aunt all flew over to France.\n\nRoss said: 'In 20 minutes we had packed our bags.\n\n'I say bags but all I had was a t-shirt, a change of underwear, a pair of jeans and my passport.\n\n'It was the same for my sister but my brother did have to go back and get his passport.'\n\nHer son Ross Jones today paid tribute to his 'amazing' mother (Angie pictured with husband Malcolm)\n\nSpeaking about when they arrived, he said: 'We went and saw my stepdad. I gave him a cuddle and spoke to him to make sure he was okay.\n\n'It was a sad situation.'\n\nA doctor then went to see the family and explained that unless there were any signs of improvement they couldn't operate.\n\nThey were advised that there were three potential outcomes for Angie.\n\nThe first was that if there was improvement they could operate and the second was that she would remain in a coma in a vegetative state - which the doctor explained was the most likely.\n\nBut unfortunately for the family, it was the third outcome, which saw the swelling on the brain continuing and it eventually suffocated the main artery in Angie's the brain.\n\nShe was pronounced dead at 5pm on October 1.\n\nRoss said that although her family were upset, he was glad her suffering was over.\n\nHe added: 'I was relieved at that time.\n\n'We had seen her on the Saturday, Sunday and most of Monday.\n\n'Saturday was the worst day. Speaking to her and getting nothing in response.\n\n'Knowing I was never going to get a hug or a kiss from her or that I would never hear her sayings.\n\n'The doctors said that in a coma the last thing to go would be the hearing so if there was anything we wanted to say, we should speak now.\n\n'They said keep laughing in the room and playing music, making her feel good.\n\n'We can't tell if that ever worked - we just have to assume it did.'\n\nThe family were later advised to say their goodbyes.\n\nRoss said: 'It was the hardest thing I have ever done.\n\n'I said we knew she would always be looking out for us.\n\n'I knew she would miss me getting married and having children, but I said I knew she would always be there for me and we would always make her proud.\n\n'We told her how much we loved her and that she was a great mum.\n\n'We put about her on Facebook so we told her we wished she could see how much people loved her.\n\n'She suffered from a little bit of depression and would say she had no friends so we said we wish she could many people love you right now.'\n\nRoss says he will always remember his mum for the generous person she was.\n\n'She was a healthcare assistant and helped deliver babies.\n\n'People would stop her in the street and in Tesco saying you helped deliver my baby.\n\n'Mum and dad split when I was young. She was lovely - she would always make sure there was food on the table.\n\n'She was always up for a laugh and would come to watch me play football on a Sunday. She didn't like football, she was supporting me.'\n\nHe added: 'She always said we can do anything we want if we work hard for it.\n\n'She had such a hard work ethic and passed that onto her kids. It is the same with her kindness and selflessness.'\n\nAngie's body remains in France because the couple did not have insurance.\n\nThe family are now hoping to raise \u00a34,000 to bring her back to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where her children live.\n\nRoss said: 'She said she wanted to be cremated in Stevenage. That's where the family was brought up. Its home - she always wanted to be there.\n\n'We have said our goodbyes so we want to give others the opportunity to as there are lots of people who haven't.\n\n'Mum always put herself last so we want to let her be first for once.'\n\nA GoFundMe page has since been set up to help with the costs.", "description": "Angie Dowsett, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, had been touring France with her husband.
