At the minute, he has injuries.\n\n\u2018This little niggle he had is a small, small injury. We just need to get it right. We are just careful and it is my duty to work with him. The medical team are working so hard with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I have been there as a player and, if you miss a pre-season through an injury in particular, then you are playing catch-up. At the moment he is playing catch-up and that\u2019s no fault of his own. He has played four seasons now full-on, game after game with international tournaments. So, it is right to be a bit careful.\u2019", "description": "Chelsea have been dealt another injury blow during the international break after N\u2019Golo Kante picked up a problem during the warm-up before France\u2019s clash with Iceland.
