The (Likud) lead is very small.\" On Tuesday morning, just before voting in Jerusalem, he urged people to \"go vote\" on his Twitter account.\n\nHis chief rival Benny Gantz, the country\u2019s former army chief and head of the centrist Blue and White party, also urged citizens to participate but called for change.\n\n\"Today, we are voting for change. We will succeed in bringing hope, all of us together, without corruption and without extremism. May we have a successful day throughout the country,\" he said as he voted in the central city of Rosh Ha\u2019Ayin.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He seems to be the sticking point in negotiations with other parties,\" said Daniel Katz, 33, a software developer voting for the ultra-orthadox party United Judaism Torah in Jerusalem. UTJ and the other major ultra-orthodox party Shas have pledged to join a coalition headed by Mr Netanyahu.\n\nAdel Melois, 18, a first-time voter who decided to cast her ballot for Jewish Power, a hard-right party, agreed. Jewish Power is also expected to be in a Likud-led coalition.\n\n\"Netanyahu was good for the last few years but there are a lot of things, including the security of the country, that he could have looked after better. We need new ideas for the Right,\" she said.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital where many voters traditionally vote centre or left-wing, there were equal signs of frustration with the prime minister, but largely because of the possible corruption cases against him.\n\n\"The most important thing is to switch out the King,\" said Iftah Gorali, a Blue and White voter, referencing Mr Netanyahu's nickname King Bibi.\n\n\"The King is stuck in his place, we need to get rid of him, and our best chance is through Blue and White.... The corruption is just growing. We have an entire country that most of the time is dealing with the prime minister's personal problems. Why?\" he asked.\n\nThe last polls published over the weekend by Israeli TV Channel 11 and 12 showed Mr Netanyahu neck and neck with chief rival Mr Gantz, with both their parties securing around 32 seats. They also predicted neither Mr Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing block nor Mr Gantz\u2019s centre-left allies will be able to secure enough seats together to win the overall 61 seat majority needed to form a ruling government, prompting fears of a third election.\n\nCommentators said Mr Netanyahu, who is campaigning under the shadow of indictment in three corruption cases, of \u201cthrowing everything but the kitchen sink\u201d at the elections in his last-ditch attempt to secure a historic fifth term in office. His critics say he needs to stay in power as a shield against possible legal action in the future.\n\nJust hours before polling stations opened, Mr Netanyahu vowed to annex \"all the settlements\" in the occupied West Bank, including an enclave deep in the heart of the largest Palestinian city: a move illegal under international law and sure to ignite conflict with the Palestinians and possibly the rest of the region if implemented.\n\n\"I intend to extend sovereignty on all the settlements and the (settlement) blocs,\" including \"sites that have security importance or are important to Israel's heritage,\" Mr Netanyahu said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio.\n\nIt followed comments made a few days earlier where he vowed to immediately annex the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea area, which makes up just over 22 per cent of the West Bank, if re-elected.\n\nHe also arranged a meeting with President Donald Trump to mull the idea of a mutual defence treaty just ahead of the elections. Before that he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi, again part of a campaign to remind the public of his unique relationship with foreign leaders, and his diplomatic skills.\n\nIsraeli media also reported the prime minister came within a hair\u2019s breadth of starting a military offensive in Gaza after he was embarrassingly forced to flee the stage in a campaign rally in the southern city of Ashdod on Wednesday, when militants from Gaza fired at the city.\n\nWhile the polls were bleak, the prime minister\u2019s supporters remained confident that Mr Netanyahu and his rightwing Likud party would still win.\n\nThere is no way that Likud won\u2019t be in the ruling coalition, we are going win Netta, 24, head of the Likud student body at Hebrew University\n\n\u201cThere is no way that Likud won\u2019t be in the ruling coalition, we are going win,\u201d said Netta, 24, head of the Likud student faction at Hebrew University at a rally in Jerusalem on Monday.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone who comes close to Netanyahu.\u201d\n\nRaphel Ohyon, 66, a driving test instructor, agreed adding that Benny Gantz had \u201clittle to no experience\u201d in politics.\n\nThe snap elections were called just months after the previous elections in the spring when Mr Netanyahu failed to form a ruling coalition, after his one-time ally and former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman and his right-wing party Yisrael Beiteinu refused to join forces at the 11th hour.\n\nRather than allow Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to give another political leader the chance to build a ruling coalition, Mr Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party and its supporters voted to go back to the polls.\n\nProminent pollsters warned that there was a chance Mr Netanyahu might fail to build a government again, given so many centre-left parties have vowed not to join forces with Mr Netanyahu because of his likely indictment on graft charges.\n\nMr Lieberman, whose party is polling at nine seats and could play kingmaker again, has also nominally promised to form a coalition with Mr Netanyahu's rivals Blue and White.\n\nIf no majority bloc is formed it could mean a third Israeli election.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu will have to make serious compromises,\" said Dahlia Scheindlin, a public opinion expert who has worked on seven election campaigns in Israel.\n\n\u201cSomeone will have to give up their promises to get the ladder and climb down from the tree. Most of the Left-wing, parties like Labour have made it clear they will not form a government with Netanyahu,\" she added.", "description": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u00a0is set to fight his toughest battle yet as\u00a0Israeli\u00a0citizens have started voting in an unprecedented second\u00a0election,\u00a0called after he failed to form a coalition in April.", "authors": ["Bel Trew", "Shira Rubin"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/07/gettyimages-1168758099.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
