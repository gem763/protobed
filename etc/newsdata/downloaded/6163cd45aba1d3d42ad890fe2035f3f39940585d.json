REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\n\nGermany, whose Frankfurt stock market is one of Europe\u2019s largest, is the most significant of a group of countries to consider such a temporary ban on short-selling of shares, including Italy and the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough no emergency measures have yet been triggered, the preparations underscore the continent\u2019s heightened state of alert, with negotiations to secure Britain\u2019s orderly departure from the European Union hanging in the balance.\n\nIn the event of a slide in markets, authorities in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Rome could curb the form of trading known as short-selling, officials in those countries told Reuters, in order to stem any exaggeration of price swings.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take the United Kingdom out of the bloc on Oct. 31 whether or not a withdrawal agreement has been reached. He has not explained how he can get around a law passed by parliament saying Britain cannot leave without a deal.\n\nMany bankers, however, fear that failure to clinch agreement this week could rattle markets far sooner.\n\nGermany\u2019s markets regulator BaFin would probably identify a basket of companies particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout of Brexit for a temporary short-selling ban, a second person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nGermany has done so before. During the financial crash last decade, BaFin singled out a number of banks and other companies to stop short-selling in those stocks.\n\nEarlier this year, the watchdog enacted its first-ever ban on short sales of a single stock, Wirecard (WDIG.DE). It lasted two months and was aimed at curbing volatility.\n\nWhile investors can also short-sell corporate bonds, BaFin is chiefly looking at companies\u2019 shares, the second person said.\n\nSHORT NOTICE\n\nThe Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) is making similar preparations. A spokesman said trading venues could briefly suspend trading in instruments such as shares if there was a spike in price swings.\n\n\u201cThe AFM will exercise restraint in applying any tools that directly interfere in trading such as temporary short-sell bans,\u201d he said. \u201cThe financial markets have become much more robust since the financial crisis of a decade ago.\u201d\n\nRome could take similar measures. An Italian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said its financial market regulator, CONSOB, could impose a short-selling ban if \u201cextreme volatility\u201d around Brexit were to endanger financial stability.\n\nA decision to enact a ban would be taken at short notice, depending on market developments, the person said.\n\nIn short-selling, traders borrow a company stock with a view to selling it, hoping to then scoop up the shares at a lower price later and pocket the difference.\n\nWhen the number of short-sellers outweighs those interested in buying the stock, which could happen if investors rush to sell after a Brexit shock, that can further drive down the price of shares.\n\nUnder EU law, national authorities have the power to introduce such bans. They are required to inform the EU umbrella body, the European Securities and Markets Authority, an ESMA spokesman said.\n\nBanks and traders are on tenterhooks as efforts between London and Brussels to seal a framework deal for when Britain leaves the bloc look as uncertain as ever.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Share traders start their trading systems at the start of the trading session the day after the Brexit deal vote of the British parliament at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, January 16, 2019.

A spokesman for Britain\u2019s FCA regulator said it had \u201ctools to respond in the event of market disruption and stand ready to act if necessary\u201d.", "description": "Germany could use emergency measures to counter any market panic from a hard Brexit, an official with direct knowledge of the matter said, such as banning bets on falling share prices, a step last used in the financial crisis.", "authors": ["John O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441439786&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0U0", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
