The man nonchalantly walks his dogs, oblivious of the danger to come. Suddenly, the man topples \u2014 a brief flash of light and what looks to be a bright burst of illumination emanates from his heel. It\u2019s gone in a flash. No bolt is ever visible, nor was there any flickering ahead of or behind the main bolt.\n\nAlex Coreas was walking his dogs Thursday evening in Spring, Tex., a suburb 15 miles north of Houston. The wild episode was caught on camera at Stuebner Airline Veterinary Hospital. ABC 13 Houston reports that Coreas is recovering, and was revived by an employee of the veterinary hospital and several good Samaritans.\n\nA GoFundMe created by Daena Coreas-Delgado, the victim\u2019s sister, stated that Coreas was \u201cin the Intensive Care Unit \u2026 starting to eat, engage, and have full conversations\u201d as of Monday morning. At the time of writing, nearly $24,000 had been raised for his medical bills.\n\nCoreas also suffered burns and lost hearing in his left ear.\n\nHowever, he escaped with his life. That\u2019s remarkable, because it looks as if Coreas suffered a direct strike.\n\nWith some meteorological sleuthing, we can try to piece together what happened in this incredible video.\n\nSigns point to a direct strike\n\nWhat is most noteworthy in the surveillance video is the fact that the three dogs were able to run away, seemingly unharmed, while the man was knocked unconscious.\n\nThat key factor increases the likelihood this was a direct strike to the victim.\n\nHumans usually don\u2019t die when the nearby ground is struck, partially because of their comparatively small leg span \u2014 and the fact that the charge entering one leg and exiting the other would not pass through the heart.\n\nCreatures such as horses, dogs and other four-legged animals with a greater leg span are more susceptible to being killed by a strike to the ground nearby. The magnitude of the electric jolt a person or animal would feel is proportional to the separation distance between their legs, assuming the current enters one and exits the other. In addition, if the charge was to enter through a four-legged animal\u2019s front or rear leg/paw, it would likely pass near \u2014 or through \u2014 vital internal organs before exiting the other set. That would increase the chance of death.\n\n\u201cIt is a bit surprising that all of the dogs were able to run away,\u201d said John Jensenius, a lightning expert with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe man reportedly required CPR and revival, another indication he was directly struck. Impacts this severe can occur with any sort of major electric shock; however, they are more common with more direct lightning strikes.\n\nA burst of light\n\nMore telltale, however, is the burst of light that seems to shoot out of his back heel in the moments immediately following the strike. This could be the result of one of two things, or the combination of both.\n\nIt could be that, given he was walking and mid-stride at the time of the strike, his foot was ever so slightly off the ground. Overwhelmed with charge, his body would have had to provide a desirable path to the ground. If one wasn\u2019t available, the charge, over a short distance, could create one.\n\nThe lightning may have found a better location to ground itself just behind the man, for which reason it could have arced out of his back foot or leg instead of the front.\n\nJensenius raises another possibility. \u201cWhat appears to look like a spark near the victim\u2019s feet is likely dust from a small impact crater in the sidewalk caused by the heat of the lightning and the rapid expansion of a small area of concrete,\u201d he writes. A divot was discovered in the concrete following the strike.\n\nThat also suggests that the narrow \u2014 but extreme \u2014 bolt of electricity struck the man directly and exited through his body. A blasting of concrete would have occurred only where the main channel of 55,000-degree electricity entered the ground. Most bolts of lightning are only about an inch wide.\n\nHow could the man have possibly survived a direct strike? We can theorize a couple of possible solutions.\n\nWhy sweat and rain may have saved Coreas\u2019s life\n\nOdds are he was decently wet with rain. Depending on how insulating his rain jacket was, he may have also been sweating, since the weather was warm and humid.\n\nThe presence of a sweaty or rainy film of moisture coating him may have allowed much of the charge (not all of it) to flow around his body \u2014 rather than altogether directly through it. This is known as a flashover effect.\n\nHow powerful was the bolt?\n\nMoreover, the lightning bolt may have had a rather small current when compared with many other strikes. The fact that we never see the bolt or flash is important.\n\n\u201cThe actual lightning strike occurred very quickly and apparently between frames in the video recording,\u201d said Jensenius.\n\nPositive lightning bolts seldom flicker much and leap 10 times faster than negative lightning. So it\u2019s plausible this was a weak positive bolt originating from the bottom of the storm (a more powerful bolt from the top of the storm would have almost certainly been fatal). Or, the man may have been struck by a negative bolt.\n\nCoreas is \u201clucky to be alive\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, one thing is certain. \u201cThe victim is very lucky to be alive,\u201d Jensenius wrote.\n\n\u201c[He\u2019s] also very lucky that there were people nearby both willing and able to administer CPR to the victim until professional medical help arrived. That CPR was likely critical in reviving the victim and limiting any brain damage that could have occurred due to a lack of oxygen to the brain. It\u2019s worth noting that those people who helped the victim were risking their lives as the dangerous conditions during the resuscitation efforts.\u201d\n\nLightning strike victims do not remain charged following a strike, and CPR should be administered right away.\n\nNineteen people have been killed in the United States this year because of lightning strikes. Most recently, a 33-year-old man was killed on Sept. 28 in Independence, Kan. He had been approaching the finish line of a trail race.", "description": "A man is recovering after surviving a direct lightning strike.
