There were streamers with teams that had everything working, but there were also streamers who felt overwhelmed and like they couldn\u2019t figure out how to use all of Twitch\u2019s moderation tools. \u201cIt popped as a problem,\u201d Shear said. \u201cWe decided we had to do better. And I think it\u2019s a big step in the right direction.\u201d Twitch\u2019s moderation philosophy, in general, comprises two parts: enforcement works on the level of the individual and on the level of the platform.\n\nThat stands in stark contrast to Twitch\u2019s social media peers, which prize unrestrained speech above just about everything else. Facebook, for example, recently said that it would let politicians lie in ads posted to its site. YouTube has found itself dragged under by whirlpools of its own making because its enforcement policies are applied inconsistently at best. Twitter has had enough trouble with its separate set of policies for world leaders that it overhauled them this week \u2014 with the feeble reminder that \u201cthe accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely.\u201d (Emphasis theirs.)\n\nTwitch started as a gaming-focused spinoff of the one-man streaming concern Justin.tv, named after Justin Kan, the cofounder who broadcast his life every hour of every day. After a nearly billion-dollar Amazon acquisition in 2014, Twitch has become the most popular live-streaming platform in the world. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Twitch has already shifted how we think of live entertainment and the people who create it. TwitchCon is only the most visible example, an IRL synecdoche.\n\n\u201cWe decided we had to do better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been a shift in how I think about the company,\u201d Shear told me. \u201cWhat\u2019s driving a lot of the ads changes, the brand at some level \u2014 it\u2019s all this refocus on the core things that are important to Twitch.\u201d But this year, he continued, the platform didn\u2019t do that many new things.\n\nTwo ways of approaching moderation\n\nI met Shear in a small room in what I\u2019d begun to call the \u201csuper-partner lounge,\u201d the custom-built space inside a nondescript ballroom reserved for Twitch\u2019s biggest stars. I saw Tim \u201cTim the Tatman\u201d Betar and Herschel \u201cDr DisRespect\u201d Beahm IV relaxing with their families away from the bustle of fans and brands. In person, Shear cuts an unassuming figure; that day in the lounge, he wore a black Twitch Staff badge just like the rest of his employees.\n\nFor individual channels, Shear said, Twitch views its job as what he described as \u201cempowerment through tools, empowerment through automation\u201d \u2014 both deployed in service of letting streamers have the communities they want. \u201cSome people\u2019s communities are irreverent and a little troll-y and all about memes,\u201d Shear said. \u201cAnd some people\u2019s communities are really earnest and connected, and people want to have a real conversation.\u201d Twitch wants to make space for both of those kinds of communities to exist on its platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very explicitly not a free speech platform.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also stream moderation, which means moderating what people are allowed to broadcast, and it\u2019s arguably more important. The recent mass shooting in Germany that was live-streamed on Twitch, for example, comes immediately to mind. Even so, Twitch focuses on intent; Shear doesn\u2019t think that actions, in the abstract, have a moral valence \u2014 they gain that through their impact on other people.\n\nThough it wants to be for everyone, Twitch isn\u2019t for everything. \u201cIt\u2019s very explicitly not a free speech platform,\u201d said Shear, which is a big difference in philosophy between Twitch and its peers.\n\n\u201cI hope people can express themselves. I hope they can share their ideas, share their thoughts. But we\u2019re not a platform for free speech. We are not upholding the First Amendment. That\u2019s the government\u2019s job. We\u2019re a community. And communities have standards for how you have to behave inside that community. And so we think that it\u2019s not anything goes.\u201d\n\nShear came to that insight because of Reddit, the freewheeling discussion board that embodied the internet\u2019s early approach to speech online. (In the beginning, its slogan was \u201cFreedom from the press.\u201d) He said he remembers being an internet entrepreneur in 2005 and the pervasive utopian desire to build the new free speech platforms of the future. \u201cBy opening communications tools to everyone and the democratization of communication and publishing, we were going to connect people and change the world for the better,\u201d Shear told me.\n\nWhile he thinks a lot of that did happen, he now understands that it was a misguided goal. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t thinking about how much you could also empower bad actors by doing that as well,\u201d Shear said. Now, the challenge for social platforms is to make sure that speech is used in ways that are productive and not actively bad for society. Shear said he saw at Reddit the difference between communities with strong moderation versus ones that didn\u2019t have much moderation at all. He said it was obvious which community he\u2019d rather be a part of.\n\n\u201cWe are not upholding the First Amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one with good, strong moderation, in many ways, is actually the place with freer speech,\u201d Shear told me. \u201cBecause it was actually the place where people could express themselves and not just get destroyed by trolls and abuse and harassment.\u201d\n\nTo do that, you need terms of service, and you need to link violations with punishments. At the moment, Twitch has a \u201cthree strikes\u201d rule before a streamer\u2019s channel is permanently suspended. TOS violations, however, can happen if a streamer misunderstands the rules. Earlier this year, Mychal \u201cTrihex\u201d Jefferson, Steven \u201cDestiny\u201d Bonnell, and Hasan \u201cHasanabi\u201d Piker all earned strikes on their accounts because they streamed a presidential Democratic debate and were issued DMCA takedown notices. For his part, Jefferson thought by doing commentary, his stream of the debate fell under fair use \u2014 which was not the case.\n\nTwitch, Shear said, really tries to follow its own TOS, even though the process of moderation is occasionally opaque to streamers. Now, Shear said, the company plans to be more transparent: it\u2019ll send the streamer a clip of the moment in a stream when a violation happens and tell them what happened and why that violates Twitch\u2019s guidelines and therefore necessitates an enforcement action. That\u2019s not what happens now, which has led to some confusion among streamers who are subject to enforcement for violations that lie in the TOS\u2019s gray areas. For people who report violations, Twitch plans to do something similar to what Twitter does: it\u2019ll tell a person who reports a violation whether any action was taken in response to their flagging.\n\n\u201cTransparency is how you build trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransparency is how you build trust,\u201d Shear told me. If you can\u2019t see how something is done, it\u2019s hard to conclude it was executed fairly. The idea is to make Twitch\u2019s process clearer so that people can see that decisions aren\u2019t made arbitrarily. \u201cTrust is consistency over time,\u201d Shear said. \u201cAnd so, if a process seems random because you can\u2019t see how it\u2019s working, you can\u2019t ever build trust because you have randomness.\u201d\n\nHe wants users to be able to trust the process, even if they can\u2019t see inside every decision. That goes double for high-profile cases \u2014 for example, when Natalia \u201cAlinity\u201d Mogollon appeared to throw one of her cats during a stream. There was an immediate backlash online. Some thought that because Mogollon is an outsized presence on Twitch that she received favorable treatment from the company. While that wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 the SPCA got involved, and in the end, said it had found Mogollon to be a responsible pet owner \u2014 Twitch didn\u2019t comment on the high-profile case at all. Not addressing individual account actions is one of its policies, but it also gave the online mob the impression that something nefarious had happened.\n\nTwitch\u2019s moderation does take into account public opinion, but only as far as it exposes problems in those processes. Here, Shear was careful to say that the platform isn\u2019t going to change the company\u2019s policy on giving comment on individual cases \u2014 which is a privacy issue \u2014 and that it\u2019s not going to change its policies on how enforcement works just because a decision might have been unpopular.\n\n\u201cwe\u2019re just less afraid maybe than some people to pull the trigger on bad actors who are popular.\u201d\n\nDespite what happened with Mogollon, most high-profile cases don\u2019t go viral. Shear said that it\u2019s hard for an individual piece of content to spread across the world on Twitch. It\u2019s not somewhere where a moment goes global \u2014 like on Twitter or Facebook \u2014 and then the whole world sees and memes it. Twitch is a place where you have to be consistently good to gain a following; you can\u2019t just capitalize on the one instant in time that brings in a rush of new followers. In Shear\u2019s view, the people who are successful are people who have proven they can do something good over a long period of time. \u201cI think the other half of it is, I think we\u2019re just less afraid maybe than some people to pull the trigger on bad actors who are popular,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re quite willing to do that when we think they\u2019ve violated a guideline.\u201d\n\nA new era of live-streaming\n\nAfter talking to Shear, it\u2019s easy to see how much live-streaming has changed. All of Twitch\u2019s recent changes \u2014 its brand refresh, which was intended to showcase streamers\u2019 brands, and its renewed focus on transparency, which will make moderation feel more consistent \u2014 are a mark of professionalization. There are new players in the market, and the competition for talent and audience share is heating up. Shear, however, doesn\u2019t think things have changed as much as I do.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is it\u2019s big enough that everything goes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, when a Twitch streamer goes somewhere, or a streamer comes to Twitch, that\u2019s a news story if they\u2019re big enough.\u201d The obvious reference here is Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins leaving Twitch for Mixer, a competitor owned by Microsoft. A few weeks later, Twitch picked up Nick \u201cNick Eh 30\u201d Amyoony from YouTube, where he had 4.6 million subscribers. Both moves made international news.\n\n\u201cWhat changed is not that people started competing over live-streamers. What changed is that live-streamers are now celebrities, like real, legit celebrities,\u201d Shear continued. \u201cAnd when a celebrity moves platforms, that\u2019s a news story.\u201d Twitch, he said, has been in a competition for talent since 2011. It keeps track of who it\u2019s trying to convince to come over to its platform, and it keeps track of who\u2019s who everywhere else.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already one of us. You may not realize it yet.\u201d\n\nThat focus on streamers is also related to Twitch\u2019s focus on viewers, because one cannot exist without the other \u2014 and, obviously, the goal is to get more people watching. Shear said the company wants to match those viewers with streamers who are doing interesting things, which is what its new ad campaign is built around. There have also been quiet changes to search to help new users discover what channels they might like on the site. Shear said that the last internal survey it ran for first-time users came back with data suggesting they\u2019d made big strides in streamer discovery.\n\nTwitch had to run a bunch of experiments so it could figure out a clear idea of where it needed to go next. At the same time, the company is also sticking with the familiar: the logo is still the Twitch glitch, and it is still purple. But now it\u2019s modular, customizable. In other words, it\u2019s grown to encompass every streamer\u2019s unique brand.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re looking for a broader range of people, and I think we\u2019re looking to get the message out that this is a thing that is welcoming to everyone,\u201d Shear said. \u201cTo quote our own brand: you\u2019re already one of us. You may not realize it yet. But we picked that for a reason. I think that really is the message we\u2019re trying to send.\u201d", "description": "In spring 2020, Twitch will gain an expanded set of chat moderation tools, along with more transparency around enforcement.
