Sullivan also spent two decades in private law practice.\n\nThe leadership shuffle will afford Pompeo the opportunity to select his own deputy at the State Department, about a year and a half after moving into the position.\n\nHuntsman announced in early August that he planned to resign as the top U.S. diplomat in Russia after two years on the job. It contributed to speculation he would mount a bid for Utah\u2019s governorship. Huntsman is expected to leave the position this month.\n\nIf confirmed, Sullivan will inherit the ambassadorship at a difficult point in U.S.-Russia relations. Despite Trump\u2019s desire to broker better relations with Moscow, both countries have butted heads on various fronts, including arms control and Russian interference in U.S. elections.\n\nThe announcement came just as former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told Congress of how she had been abruptly recalled from her post in April. According to her opening statement published by The Washington Post, Yovanovitch, who was testifying behind closed doors, told Congress that Sullivan told her Trump had \u201clost confidence\u201d in her and \u201cno longer wished\u201d for her to serve as ambassador. The statement does not identify Sullivan by name but describes her conversation with the deputy Secretary of State.\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats called Yovanovitch as a witness as part of their impeachment inquiry focused on Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.", "description": "President Trump plans to nominate John Sullivan, currently the No. 2 State Department official, as U.S. ambassador to Russia, the White House\u00a0announced Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sullivanjohnstatedept_101119getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
