The agency said Raihan was Omar's courier to al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the Taliban dismissed the al Qaeda deaths and said the Afghan government is trying to hide the fact that its operations killed civilians.\n\nThe United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and ousted the Taliban regime after they refused to hand over members of al Qaeda group behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the U.S. that killed more than 3,000 people.\n\nAfghan and U.S. officials say al Qaeda militants are still present in Afghanistan but not usually active, compared with the Islamic State militant group and the Taliban, who often mount attacks on government forces.\n\nA United Nations report released on June 30 said 717 civilian deaths were attributed to U.S. and Afghan forces during the first six months of the year, compared with 531 blamed on militants.\n\nLast week President Ashraf Ghani promised measures to reduce civilian casualties and called for extra caution in military operations, and ordered investigations.
