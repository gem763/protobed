In it, 10-year-old performer Queen Lactatia demonstrates some fierce moves while sharing a few words of profound wisdom.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends think that a drag queen is a man who wants to be a woman, and that\u2019s not true,\u201d Lactatia, whose real name is Nemis Quinn M\u00e9lan\u00e7on Golden, says. \u201cA drag queen is a man who puts on a feminine persona.\u201d\n\nMany will remember Lactatia as the young queen who joined \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran Bianca del Rio onstage in 2017, footage of which has been viewed more than 266,000 times on social media. The Montr\u00e9al, Canada, native is one of four drag performers under the age of 12 to be profiled in \u201cDrag Kids,\u201d a film that has generated critical accolades, but scrutiny as well.\n\nWennberg, whose credits include the 2018 feature film \u201cHopeless Romantic,\u201d told HuffPost she was \u201cexcited to learn more about a world that I didn\u2019t know existed\u201d when she was tapped by producer Erin Oakes to direct the documentary.\n\nMegan Wennberg Queen Lactatia performing on stage at Fiert\u00e9 Montr\u00e9al Pride 2018.\n\n\u201cThe drag kids are fierce and fabulous,\u201d Wennberg said. \u201cI think they challenge us all to think about what this could look like in our own lives, if we can be brave enough to follow our own wildest dreams.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the popularity of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d has been crucial in widening the audience for drag around the world. For her part, Wennberg believes the ubiquitousness of that competition series, paired with the use of social media platforms like YouTube and Instagram, have allowed drag, as a performance art, to reach a devoted contingent of younger viewers.\n\nFor others, the notion of drag as something other than nightlife subculture \u2015 and, hence, appropriate for the tween set \u2015 has been a bit harder to swallow. Earlier this year, \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran Violet Chachki was slammed after appearing to be nearly nude in a photo with Lactatia. Some critics argued that the image was distasteful and sexualized children.\n\nWennberg, however, believes such criticism is misguided.\n\n\u201cI think people who are upset by children dressing up \u2013 and particularly boys in dresses \u2013 need to look at why this is so upsetting to them,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately this is a film about the importance of pursuing your passion, and finding connection and community. These kids just happen to love drag.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI hope this film inspires people to think about the ways in which they can express their true selves.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrag Kids\u201d will screen at NewFest on Oct. 24.
