She immediately follows the 45-minute class with a second, 60-minute treadmill class, and sometimes a third. After work, she typically heads to Barre3 in the West Village to take two consecutive strength-training classes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely a power user,\u201d says Ms. Meisch.\n\nOn weekends, the 36-year-old ultradistance runner plans even longer workouts. For several months this year, she took five consecutive group treadmill classes every Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., logging 20-plus miles and scarfing snack bars between sessions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous,\u201d she says of her routine. \u201cIt\u2019s so funny. Who does that?\u201d\n\nPlenty of folks, actually. While Ms. Meisch is extreme, she\u2019s among the many power users crowding Manhattan\u2019s boutique fitness studio scene, an industry that, like Ms. Meisch\u2019s workout schedule, has reached eye-popping proportions and shows no signs of slowing.\n\n\u201cNew York is the experimental lab for the industry,\u201d says Paul O\u2019Reilly-Hyland, founder and chief executive officer of Zeamo, a national fitness passport platform based in Manhattan. \u201cIf it works in New York, you can scale it out.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you fit your workout routines into your schedule? Join the conversation below.\n\nWhile the specialty fitness studio trend started more than a decade ago with places dedicated to yoga, Pilates and then spinning, recent years have seen an explosion in new offerings.\n\nNew Yorkers willing to spend $25 to $40 a class now choose from studios dedicated to rowing, stretching, cold training, hot yoga, naked yoga, yoga with sonic vibrations, HIIT, boot camp, sword fighting, trampolines, rock climbing, pole dancing, circus arts, and, of course, fitness boxing accompanied by a full liquor bar.\n\nThese studios have clustered in several Manhattan neighborhoods, creating outdoor fitness malls where gym-bag toting power-users hop from one storefront studio to another.\n\n\u201cThey do Barry\u2019s Bootcamp one day and SoulCycle the next,\u201d says Mr. O\u2019Reilly-Hyland.\n\nIndeed, there are four ZIP Codes in Manhattan\u2014Chelsea, the East Village, Flatiron and Midtown West\u2014with more than 100 fitness spots, according to ClassPass, a platform that offers members access to 1,600 of New York City\u2019s 5,500 gyms and studios.\n\nThe epicenter is likely 10 square blocks in the West 20s between Fifth and Seventh avenues that host more than 70 gyms and studios, including one of Mile High Run Club\u2019s three Manhattan locations.\n\nMile High co-founder and CEO William Heath says the clustering boosts business at every studio. \u201cWe\u2019re all drawing off a like-minded customer, and that customer wants choice and convenience,\u201d he says.\n\nAt a traditional gym, the ideal customer buys a membership and stays home watching Netflix . But at specialty studios where most pay by the class, the power user is king. Studios say they make 80% of their revenue off 20% of their clients.\n\nSo far, there seem to be enough fitness fanatics around town to feed the boom. ClassPass says its New York members spend more on fitness than folks in any other city, buying 30% more credits a month than the national average. They are also far more likely to buy additional credits when they max out their monthly subscription plan.\n\nMaria Theodoris, a 43-year-old aesthetic laser technician, is a typical ClassPass power user. She buys the $230 monthly plan, the largest package available, but often spends another $200 a month on additional credits so she can take her usual 18 classes a week\u2014typically a 6:30 a.m. strength-training class at FlyBarre in Midtown followed by evening barre, Pilates and yoga class at Exhale and SLT.\n\n\u201cA lot of times my friends will go to happy hour. I give that up to go to my classes,\u201d she says.\n\nNot surprisingly, fitness fanatics like Ms. Theodoris are courted by studios.\n\n\u201cPower users are your brand maker, the ones most likely to speak highly of you,\u201d says Mr. Heath. He says his treadmill studios reward these clients with extra class credits and balloons for hitting milestones.\n\nRamon Castillon, president of Row House, a rowing studio that has expanded to more than 30 locations since launching in Manhattan, says the chain retains power users with goal challenges. Folks who row a million meters\u2014that\u2019s 620 miles\u2014get a Row House backpack, for example.\n\nAnd because these clients are likely in great shape, they serve as walking billboards.\n\n\u201cThey wear it to the coffee shop and the dry cleaner and the grocery stores,\u201d he says of the swag.\n\nIs New York\u2019s market saturated? Probably not yet, says Mr. O\u2019Reilly-Hyland. But he often sees the most successful new class concepts adopted by big-box gyms, adding to the competition.\n\nSo try them while you can\u2014just like with curious new restaurants, the failure rate among fitness studios with quirky concepts can be high. \u201cA lot of them won\u2019t last long,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough industry.\u201d\n\nWrite to Anne Kadet at Anne.Kadet@wsj.com", "description": "Power users are crowding Manhattan\u2019s boutique fitness-studio scene, spending hours a day on extreme workouts.", "authors": ["Anne Kadet"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109859/social", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
