The second condition is that new listings will appear every hour from 12pm until 5pm on the eBay Deals page here.\n\nIf you do buy a console, it'll be shipped from Friday, so you won't get it until next week. But if you can grab one, the saving is pretty solid. eBay wouldn't tell Kotaku Australia yesterday how many units were being supplied, but Press Start are reporting that there'll be 160 units dropped every hour, with only 30 of the coloured consoles and 100 of the grey ones.\n\nI've reached out to eBay for confirmation on the amounts and what stores are supporting the promotion, and I'll update this post with exact store links and amounts when those become available. Until then, make sure you set aside some time today for 12pm.", "description": "$289 wasn't a bad deal for the Switch Lite, but it's not as good as $229.", "authors": ["Keza Macdonald", "Cecilia D'Anastasio"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/k/2019/07/ninswitchlite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
