Martin and Ryan J. Condal.\n\n'The series is said to focus on the reign of Targaryen kings in the lead-up to the events of Game of Thrones, aligning the vision of the project much more closely to the days of Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) than the now scrapped Naomi Watts-starring prequel,' the Reporter claimed.\n\nGOT finalized its season in May. The show got some horrible reviews and ratings but still took several Emmys home in September.\n\nWatts gave it her all to prep for the prequel.\n\nOn-screen: Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke)\n\nShe said she had not seen the original show before agreeing to star in the spin-off, but binged all eight seasons within three months after becoming 'hooked'.\n\n'I didn't start watching until I was approached about this job. But my brother [the photographer, Ben Watts], who is heavily into it, told me, 'Under no circumstances are you going to turn this down,' she told Net-A-Porter's PorterEdit magazine.\n\nNaomi noted that as soon as she began watching the show, she 'was in - hook, line and sinker.'\n\nWatts also said that she knew that the show would increase her fame.\n\nShe said: 'I still have fears about that. I don't really know what to prepare for.'\n\nThe Game of Thrones prequel was believed to be called Bloodmoon.\n\nIt was meant to be set more than 5000 years before the events of the main series, following the story of the Children Of The Forest.\n\nA source had said the show made a promise to divulge the 'horrifying secrets of Westeros's history to the true origin of the White Walkers.'\n\nThe insider said earlier this year: 'Thrones' fans will be delighted to hear things have started with the prequel.\n\n'Those working on the set in Belfast are referring to the series as Bloodmoon. Producers have put together a stellar cast and it will be must-watch telly for anyone who loves Game Of Thrones.'\n\nThis news of the GOT prequel ending comes just after it was reported that GOT creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had dropped out of the next Star Wars project.", "description": "Naomi Watts was spotted for the first time since it was announced that the Game of Thrones prequel she had already shot a pilot for was not moving forward to series.", "authors": ["Marisa Okano", "Heidi Parker For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/21/20398678-0-image-a-14_1572472594535.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
