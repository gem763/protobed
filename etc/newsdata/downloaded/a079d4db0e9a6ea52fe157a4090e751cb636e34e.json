Japan\u2019s weather agency is warning a powerful typhoon may bring torrential rains to central Japan over the weekend. Typhoon Hagibis had winds gusting up to 270 kilometers per hour (168 mph) Thursday morning. It is expected to weaken over cooler waters as it nears Japan\u2019s main island.(NASA Worldview, Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) via AP) Photo: NASA Worldview via AP\n\nHagibis, which means speed in Filipino, had maximum sustained winds of up to 270 kilometers and stronger gusts at noon Thursday near Chichi island in the Pacific, about 1,000 kilometers off Tokyo's southern coast. It was moving north at the speed of 20 kph and is expected to weaken over cooler waters as it nears Japan's main island.\n\nIt's the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency says the typhoon is forecast to hit ashore in the Tokyo area late Saturday and urged people to take precautions to avoid potentially life-threatening danger. Japan's central Pacific coast may see torrential rains beginning Friday while high waves and tides may cause flooding.\n\nAirlines and train services anticipate cancellations affecting holidaymakers traveling over the three-day weekend that includes Sports Day holiday on Monday.\n\nThe approaching typhoon is spreading fear especially in Chiba, near Tokyo, which was hit by Typhoon Faxai last month and many residents are still recovering from damage to their homes. The typhoon tore many electrical poles and snapped cables, triggering extensive outages that lasted for weeks, contributing to heat illnesses and other health problems among elderly people.\n\nEast Japan Railway Co (JR East) said it may suspend services on most local lines and bullet trains around Tokyo before the typhoon arrives. It said it is preparing to release information in English, Chinese and Korean on its website and its Twitter account, Kyodo News reported.\n\nJapan Airlines and All Nippon Airways said they may ground flights as early as Friday depending on the typhoon's movement.\n\nJapan is regularly hit by Pacific storms, including Faxai in September. Typhoon Jebi flooded a terminal and a runway at Kansai International Airport last year.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
