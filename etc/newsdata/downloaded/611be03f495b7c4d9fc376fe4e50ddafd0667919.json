From shows that she attended because of their inclusive representation to those that missed the mark, the 26-year-old gave her 566K followers peek into the industry \u2014 and the problems that still exist within it.\n\nHunter McGrady is speaking out about turning down Fashion Week opportunities with brands that weren't inclusive. (Photo: Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cI believe that it\u2019s important to take a stand on some things, and I was just tired of, every Fashion Week, being the biggest girl in the room. So this year, I decided to do something about it and not attend anything that wasn\u2019t inclusive,\u201d McGrady tells Yahoo Lifestyle, via email, about her mindset heading into the week. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how many wouldn\u2019t be inclusive, considering its 2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to a piece that the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition model wrote for Glamour, she was forced to miss out on a total of 32 opportunities this season because of the standard she had set for her attendance.\n\n\u201cIt had to be inclusive! TRULY inclusive! Meaning larger sizes and bodies, LGBTQ, and all races,\u201d she explains to Yahoo Lifestyle of her requirements. \u201cI would ask, \u2018Do they carry my size?\u2019 AKA: Will I see myself represented on the runway?\u201d\n\nOne brand that the size 16/18 model praised throughout the week was Chromat, for a show that she walked for herself.\n\n\u201cChromat is always one that stands out to me,\u201d McGrady says. \u201cBecca the owner and creator is truly inclusive. She has made a space for everyone because there IS space for everyone in the fashion industry.\u201d\n\nMcGrady also participated in the first size-inclusive bridal fashion show at theCURVYCon 2019.\n\nStill, she was faced with extreme disappointment when she was cast for a few shows (for brands she didn\u2019t name), before being told that, on second thought, organizers had decided to not use any plus-size models on the runway after all.\n\n\u201cThey need to expand. Its so simple! Fashion is not exclusive to one type of person!\u201d she continues. \u201cIt\u2019s so wild to me that there are still only a handful of shows that are inclusive and have larger sizes.\u201d\n\nAnd so, while celebrating those that are inclusive, McGrady will continue to condemn brands that aren\u2019t, all in an effort to push toward positive change.\n\n\u201cI have gotten a great response! A lot of people can relate to feeling this way!\u201d she says. \u201cChange doesn\u2019t happen in silence.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Hunter McGrady is speaking out about having to turn down a slew of Fashion Week opportunities because brands still aren't inclusive.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YleQ7biEDnt8KOog4x5phA--~B/aD02MDAwO3c9Mzk5ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ee5371f0-d64e-11e9-9f76-74183a3fcf1d", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
