The idea was to help small teams navigate the world of hardware manufacturing and, ultimately, get them to actually deliver their crowdfunded product to backers. Today, the crowdfunding platform is debuting four new badges that\u2019ll show up on some of these Hardware Studio projects, particularly ones that are part of the studio\u2019s Connection program, which is more competitive for acceptance, but provides additional tools, like a product planner for helping keep track of materials and office hours with engineers.\n\nThe badges should give backers a clear idea of where the product was in development prior to its Kickstarter campaign launch. There are four levels, in order of least prepared to most:\n\nEngaged: the backers have been accepted to Connection and have a working proof-of-concept prototype. The team \u201cunderstands challenges and is realistic about project timelines and costs.\u201d\n\nReady Level 1: the project has a \u201cmature\u201d prototype that could become a manufactured product. It\u2019s on track to launch but still in the prototype phase, and some user testing has been completed. The product can also be produced at the target cost.\n\nReady Level 2: the product will be able to be manufactured at its expected volume, and production plans are in place. The Kickstarter funding is only needed to buy production tools and materials and to certify the product. It also has undergone user testing and has been updated to reflect feedback.\n\nReady Level 3: the product is fully ready for manufacturing, and delivery risks are low. The Kickstarter funding is only needed for manufacturing.\n\nKickstarter doesn\u2019t guarantee that projects will eventually ship, but it at least is trying to give backers some idea of what to expect. The badge is a good step toward preventing people from losing their money on an ill-fated idea.", "description": "Kickstarter projects that launch with its Hardware Studio Connection will display a badge that advertises how far along their project is.", "authors": ["Ashley Carman", "May"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDl5Yi30H95RrH1ktLIv1Tbmkc4=/0x322:7661x4333/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10844587/kickstarter_badges.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-15"}
