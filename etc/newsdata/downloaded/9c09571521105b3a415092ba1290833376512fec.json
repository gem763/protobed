Bryan Shaw came on with two outs and struck out rookie pinch-hitter Austin Allen.\n\nThe Rockies took a 1-0 lead in the third when Pat Valaika hit a leadoff double, advanced on Eric Lauer\u2019s wild pitch and scored on Drew Butera\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nSan Diego tied it in the fourth when Luis Urias\u2019 two-out bloop single brought in Josh Naylor from second base. Myers opened the inning with a double but was picked off by Peter Lambert before Naylor doubled.\n\nLambert allowed one run and five hits in five innings.\n\nLauer gave up one run and four hits in six innings.\n\nNIFTY PLAY\n\nRockies shortstop Trevor Story made a diving stop of a grounder by Machado and flipped the ball with his glove to second baseman Pat Valaika to start an inning-ending double play in the first. Story made another nice play to end the eighth, sliding on the outfield grass to nab Austin Hedges\u2019 grounder and then throwing him out with a one-hopper.\n\nOUTFIELD ASSISTS\n\nPadres rookie right fielder Josh Naylor threw out Daniel Murphy trying to stretch a leadoff single into a double in the second, and Nick Martini threw out Charlie Blackmon trying to take second on Nolan Arenado\u2019s fly ball to left in the fourth.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: RHP Chi Chi Gonz\u00e1lez (0-6, 7.29) is scheduled to start Tuesday night\u2019s opener of athree-game home series against St. Louis, which is expected to counter with RHP Michael Wacha (6-6, 4.98).\n\nPadres: Rookie RHP Cal Quantrill (6-6, 4.57) is scheduled to start Monday night\u2019s opener of a four-game series against the Chicago Cubs, who counter with RHP Kyle Hendricks (9-9, 3.39).\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Wil Myers singled in Manny Machado with one out in the 10th inning to give the San Diego Padres a 2-1 win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies and a series victory in a matchup between the worst teams in the NL West.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/rockies_padres_baseball_07907_c0-191-4558-2848_s1770x1032.jpg?cebfc7070ceca8b0bf82a6b49b215cff3183fbef", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
