Land Rover has unveiled the all-new Defender (right) - the return of the iconic model that's ready for 21st-century living, the British brand says\n\nThe eagerly-anticipated new Land Rover Defender was launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show on Tuesday morning and is the car maker's most significant new model for years\n\nLand Rover describes the new Defender - which has been proved to be one of the car industry's recent worst kept secrets following a string of image leaks - as \u2018expedition ready\u2019 and \u2018fun without the flaws\u2019 of the ageing original.\n\nBut although the new incarnation of the British icon has been designed and engineered in the UK, the new Defender will be built abroad - at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s massive new factory at Nitra, in Slovakia, giving the firm a foothold within the EU if, as planned, the UK leaves following the growing Brexit row.\n\nThe boxy and upright new off-roader promises the traditional go-anywhere ability to traverse deserts, mountains, rocky terrain, and Arctic ice.\n\nIt can paddle through rivers and streams to a depth of up to 900mm, aided by the car maker's first electronic wade programme that's been tested to the extreme.\n\nIn fact, the new Defender has been subject to 62,000 different tests over 744,000 miles in some of the world\u2019s harshest climates from 50-degree desert heat to minus 40 degree Baltic conditions to ensure it is ready to take the iconic mantle.\n\nThe new Defender has been subject to 62,000 different tests over 744,000 miles in some of the world\u2019s harshest climates from 50-degree desert heat to minus 40 degree Baltic conditions to ensure it is ready for every eventuality\n\nGloss white steel rimmed wheels echo those on early Land Rovers for the most basic version available\n\nThe boxy and upright new off-roader promises the traditional go-anywhere ability to traverse deserts, mountains, rocky terrain, and arctic ice\n\nGround clearance of up to 291mm means it can tackle steep angles easier \u2013 downhill and uphill.\n\nBut it also includes hi-tech features including the \u2018X-ray vision\u2019 mode first seen in the new Range Rover Evoque.\n\nThis uses exterior cameras to allow drivers to see on the central touchscreen what\u2019s under the vehicle, plus a digital rear mirror - also using cameras - to give motorists a clear view behind unimpeded by passengers.\n\nA new generation infotainment system can connect two smartphones at the same time and the wi-fi connected car is 5G future-proofed by allowing software updates to be downloaded over the air. It can even handle satellite phones, just in case you are taking your Defender into remote areas.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The new Defender is packed with hi-tech features. This includes the \u2018X-ray vision\u2019 mode first seen in the new Range Rover Evoque, using exterior cameras to beam a view of what\u2019s under the vehicle onto the dashboard screen\n\nThe vehicle\u2019s pioneering 'terrain response' system means that experienced off-road drivers can choose the setting they want want for the ground being covered \u2013 such as ruts, mud, sand, rock or snow\n\nNovice offroaders can simply put it the Defender's system into automatic so it can decide which modes to flutter between to tackle difficult terrains\n\nThe Defender can paddle through rivers and streams to a depth of up to 900mm, aided by the car maker's first electronic wade programme that's been tested to the extreme\n\nLand Rover Defender: Will it fit in my garage?

But it must also have agility on the road as well. It has. Its manners on the road are stunning.\u2019\n\nChief designer Gerry McGovern added: \u2019The new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it. This is a new Defender for a new age.\u2019\n\nState of the art \u2018cyber security\u2019 built into the new Defender's system is promised to deter thieves, according to Land Rover\n\nIf you don't want your Defender to be an rugged utilitarian tool, then you can spec it to an extremely high standard so it feels more like on on Land Rover's luxurious Range Rovers\n\nThe modern version has durable rubberised flooring allowing the interior to be easily cleaned with a brush or a wipe\n\nLand Rover features and technology at a glance FEATURES - Five trim levels: S, SE, HSE, First Edition and top-of-the range \u2018Defender X\u2019 - Front middle \u2018jump seat\u2019 for three-abreast travel (made possible by dashboard mounted ear-stick) - Optional folding fabric roof, echoing original, gives an open-top feel and allows passengers I the second row of the 110 to stand up when parked. - Durable rubberised flooring for easy brush or wipe clean - Portable rinse-system to washout mud. - Optional satin protective film \u2018wrap\u2019 to protect paint-work - Six \u2018curry hooks\u2019 for carrying take-aways - Tread-plates on top of bonnet reflect those on the original - \u2018Alpine lights\u2019 \u2013 small upper windows allowing passengers to look up at mountains - Exposed interior structural elements emphasise its industrial nature and simplicity - Side-hinged rear tail-gate - Exterior spare wheel on the back - Lots of interior grab-handles - \u2018Side-saddle\u2019 storage over side windows - Gloss white steel rims wheel option, like original - Storage space for two 2-litre bottles ACCESSORIES - Four accessory packs: Explorer, Adventure, Country and Urban - Electric winch - Roof-top tent - Roof rack platform - Specially designed side extendable ladder - Tow bar - Inflatable waterproof awning - Bespoke air-intake snorkel\n\nSeparated by decades: Having the new Defender pose next to an original Land Rover shows how far vehicle design has come\n\nThe Defender is aimed at everyone, from families needing a car for the school run to those who want to enjoy an extreme outdoors lifestyle\n\nThe car has been tested in a variety of climates to ensure it can take on all temperatures.

So much so that Billionaire British petro-chemical tycoon Sir Jim Ratcliffe is planning a rival back to basics Projekt Grenadier 4X4 to fill the gap left by the original Defender.\n\nThe outgoing 71-year-old Defender model was built at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Solihull factory near Birmingham until production ceased in 2016.\n\nAlso reflecting the design of the original is the side-hinged rear tailgate and the option to have the spare wheel on the back\n\nThe Defender should be able to take on everything that's thrown at it, including muddy bogs and other forest terrains\n\nLand Rover Defender: A brief history\n\nThe original Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out a car on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey. It was the workhorse 4X4 vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then using.\n\nThe first pilot pre-production model called \u2018Huey\u2019 after its registration number \u2018HUE 166\u2019 and is fully working.\n\nThe original Defender began life in 1948 when it made its debut at the Amsterdam Motor Show as the first Land Rover, created out of aluminium as a practical vehicle for farmers and was meant to be Britain\u2019s answer to the Jeep during the immediate post-war austerity when steel was scarce.\n\nThe outgoing 71-year-old Defender model \u2013 much loved and often driven by the Queen, other members of the Royal Family, and Winston Churchill \u2013 was built at Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s Solihull factory near Birmingham until production ceased in 2016. Since then second-hand prices of existing Defenders have soared as they become \u2018collectors\u2019 items\u2019 \u2013 and increasingly a target for thieves.\n\nThe final version of the previous-generation Land Rover Defender being driven off the production line on 29 January 2016\n\nThe Queen has frequently been pictured at the wheel of her Land Rover Defender, mostly in use on the Sandringham Estate\n\nAstonishingly, some three-quarters of the two million Defenders ever built since then are said to be still in regular use.\n\nThe Defender name itself can be traced back to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover launched the previous year called Discovery.\n\nTo cheering and applause from the workforce at Land Rover\u2019s Solihull factory near Birmingham, the final Land Rover Defender 4X4 drove off the production line in January 2016 and joined the firm\u2019s heritage collection.\n\nThe Royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.\n\nThe Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has driven or been driven in Land Rovers ever since. She used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953.\n\nWinston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II\u2019s tour of England in 1982.\n\nPrince Harry became the first person to enjoy an exclusive sneak-peek at the new Defender at a pre-launch event in Holland ahead of next May\u2019s \u2018Invictus Games The Hague 2020\u2019, of which he is patron.\n\nGoing on safari?
