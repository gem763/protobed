Twenty-five thousand women \u2013 more than 10% of the country\u2019s population \u2013 made their way to the parliamentary square to rally for their rights. Since that day, Iceland has been at the forefront of women\u2019s rights, and since 2009 it has been at the top of the World Economic Forum global gender gap index.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the fight is won though, and Icelandic women continue the battle for true equality \u2013 not just for women, but for the LGBT community too. Despite a reputation for being one of the most progressive nations towards LGBT people, Iceland has in fact not always gone as far as it could. A recent bill \u2013 a form of self-identification for trans people \u2013 has moved the country further along. The prime minister of Iceland, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir, was the driving force. For her, it was a way to ensure that Iceland was again setting an example for the world. \u201cWell, you could say that we have been running a little bit behind, but now with this legislation we\u2019re actually again at the front. So it took some time I think for this small group of people to actually get heard.\u201d\n\nThis bitter culture war over trans rights in the UK hasn\u2019t helped anyone, and it certainly doesn\u2019t make anyone safer\n\nMuch like the feminist movement, trans people have struggled to be heard. While in Britain so often trans rights are considered in opposition to women\u2019s rights, in Iceland the two are seen not just as compatible, but complementary. These movements aren\u2019t disconnected. On the contrary, the reason the wider LGBT movement in Iceland has been so successful is thanks to the feminist movement, which has inspired and fought alongside them. Even though the Women\u2019s Strike in 1975 may have been about basic civil rights in Iceland, its effect still lives on and emboldens the human rights movement as a whole.\n\nThe photographer Henri Kisielewski travelled to Iceland to capture the moment when this momentous social change took place, and to offer an insight into the lives of those it would most affect. As the bill passed through parliament, he met and photographed various trans people, feminists and lawmakers \u2013 including Jakobsd\u00f3ttir and the former president Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir, the first democratically elected female president in history.\n\nTo the trans community the changes have been hugely significant. Trans people can now change their name and gender via a statutory declaration, and they also have increased access to necessary trans-related healthcare. As Sandra R\u00f3s \u2013 a trans woman \u2013 recalls, the system used to be far too complicated: \u201cBefore the new law, you had to be in the transition process and live under the \u2018correct gender role\u2019 for a year in order to begin taking hormones. Then you had to be in the transition process for a year and a half to be allowed to apply for a name and gender change.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sandra R\u00f3s: \u2018The system used to be far too complicated.\u2019 Photograph: Henri Kisielewski\n\nThe idea of a \u201ccorrect gender role\u201d in the old law was highly controversial within both trans\u2019 and women\u2019s rights organisations. Legally encoding gender roles in a modern society seemed wildly out of touch with the direction of travel in society. Erasing that concept was one of the great achievements of the new law.\n\nIn Iceland the women\u2019s rights movement as a whole has been wholly supportive of trans rights for decades. All major feminist and human rights organisations declared their support for the law, and hailed it as an important step in reaching true equality in Iceland. For them, it was obvious. And for trans people like me, it offered a sense of hope for the future \u2013 a future where we can all work together to make the lives of those most in danger more positive.\n\n\n\n\u00deorbj\u00f6rg \u00deorvaldsd\u00f3ttir, the chair of Samt\u00f6kin \u201978 \u2013 the national LGBTI organisation of Iceland \u2013 reflected on just how important this legislation was from a feminist perspective. \u201cThis is obviously a great step forward for LGBTQ+ rights, but the new law is also an important feminist milestone. Transphobia \u2013 as well as prejudice against LGBTQ+ people in general \u2013 is deeply rooted in outdated gender norms and misogyny. The passing of this legislation sends an affirmative message to society that every individual should be able to define and live their gender as they please without prejudice. I believe that this will benefit everyone, cis people and trans people alike.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the moral panic of the day \u2013 but they can\u2019t make me feel bad about being trans | Allison Gallagher Read more\n\nThis certainly rings true with the experiences of trans women, who face everyday misogyny and abuse, on top of relentless transphobia. Official numbers show that 26% of women in the UK experience domestic violence, with supporting numbers showing that trans women are at heightened risk. Recent reports in the UK show an 81% increase in recorded hate crime towards transgender people.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious that this bitter culture war over trans rights in the UK hasn\u2019t helped anyone \u2013 whether cis or trans \u2013 and it certainly doesn\u2019t make anyone safer. But if you\u2019re not trans, I don\u2019t blame you for tuning out of the debate. I wish I could. With the climate crisis and Brexit looming, it\u2019s just another thing that makes me feel anxious and unsafe.\n\nBut if the UK truly wants to create a safe and just society, it needs to move away from limiting the freedoms of minority groups based on false narratives or for political gain. It needs to build a strong human rights movement that fights for the liberation of everyone, because none of us are free until we are all free. In the words of Finnbogad\u00f3ttir: \u201cIf you think of it that way, it\u2019s freedom. Everybody wants freedom.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Owl Fisher is a writer, filmmaker and campaigner.
