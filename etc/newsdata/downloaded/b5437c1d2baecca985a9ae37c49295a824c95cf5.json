We\u2019re so busy trying to get appointment viewership.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t, even though we\u2019re totally left-leaning, we don\u2019t want to admit it,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cWe could be so much better than what we are,\u201d Davis adds. \u201cYou learn it in journalism school, we\u2019re supposed to be middle of the road, that\u2019s our job. Now it\u2019s just infotainment is all its become.\u201d\n\nDavis then goes on to criticize CNN\u2019s morning editors\u2019 call, led by president Jeff Zucker, saying he refuses to listen to them because they\u2019re \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t listened to a 9 a.m. call in about 15 years,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t listen to it. It\u2019s all bullshit. It\u2019s all a bunch of bullshit.\u201d\n\nDuring another part of the undercover video, CNN field production supervisor Gerald Sisnette is heard complaining about the degree to which the network covers President Trump and his administration, and expresses hope that the president will die soon so it can cover other topics.\n\n\u201cThis is a story that\u2019s not gonna go away,\u201d explains Sisnette. \u201cTrump in general, the only way this story goes away is when he dies, hopefully soon.\u201d\n\nThursday video is part of an ongoing series by Project Veritas in which the group will release undercover footage from inside CNN aimed at further revealing the news network\u2019s partisan slant. Monday\u2019s video showed a CNN media coordinator saying Zucker has a \u201cpersonal vendetta\u201d against President Trump, while Tuesday\u2019s clip showed CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez privately admitting Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings \u201csmells bad.\u201d", "description": "Project Veritas released video showing CNN staffers demoralized by the network's focus on conflict and acknowledging it has a political bias.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/01/CNN-Center-HQ-building-Atlanta-AP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
