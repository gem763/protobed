This can help to provide clarity and give answers to the questions a couple may feel are unanswered. * Try to deconstruct the affair, rather than assigning blame. * Get to the roots of where the infidelity started, and make decisions on your relationship going forward.\n\nMatty is the author of a new book, Sex Down Under (pictured)\n\nMatty outlined some of the reasons why men and women start affairs, something that's not always related to sex.\n\nShe said people may feel ignored or neglected in their current relationship which means they're seeking intimacy with others, along with feelings of being wanted, needed or desired.\n\nSpeaking previously to Daily Mail Australia, Matty said the sexual health of any relationship was conditional on defining what made you and your partner happy.\n\n'More important than the frequency of sex is how satisfied couples are with their sex lives,' she said.\n\n'Less sex doesn't automatically equate to less love, happiness and fulfilment, especially for couples who have been together for a long time.\n\n'Instead, for them, companionship, trust and mutual reliability are often more important than tonnes of steamy sex.'", "description": "Australian sex therapist Matty Silver has revealed how an affair can rescue a marriage.
