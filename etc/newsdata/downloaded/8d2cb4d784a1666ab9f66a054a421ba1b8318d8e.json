Cdr Tully urged the public to avoid that area while the protests were taking place.\n\nThere were about 11 different protest groups, including the hardline activists that blockaded city intersection during the Extinction Rebellion protests last month.\n\nmedia_camera Activists from Extinction Rebellion caused major disruptions throughout Melbourne earlier this month in a week-long protest against climate change.\n\nAbout 80 people turned out to a pre-blockade meeting on Sunday where organisers outlined plans for the week \u2014 including using decoy groups to distract police, blocking entrances to the centre and attempting to get into the conference itself.\n\n\u201cWe want to make life hell,\u201d one said.\n\nGroups Extinction Rebellion, Anti-Fascist Action Melbourne and Frontline Action on Coal have each urged followers to cause \u201cmass civil disobedience.\u201d\n\nTuesday will be the main day of protest, with a mass blockade planned on Clarendon Street.\n\nCdr Tully said the force respected the right to protest but law-breaking would not be tolerated.\n\n\u201cWe will act and we will act swiftly. Our intention is to facilitate a peaceful protest,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are concerns the protest activity could rival the World Economic Forum pandemonium of 2000 or the 2006 G20 demonstrations.\n\nThousands of protesters attended the WEF event with repeated confrontations in the Crown Casino precinct.\n\nmedia_camera Slogans are written in chalk outside the centre.\n\nWHAT IS IMARC?\n\nIMARC will run from Monday to Thursday.\n\nIt is billed as hosting 7000 decision-makers and mining industry leaders from around the world.\n\nPolice will also be wary of the potential for trouble at linked events, including a gala dinner to be held at the Crown Palladium room.\n\nCdr Tully said conference organisers had a private security strategy in place and officers were not part of that.\n\n\u201cOur role is external to that event. It is to manage public order,\u201d he said.\n\nPolice will be brought in from other regions to help cover the massive commitment.\n\nBlockade IMARC Alliance is planning a campaign of civic disobedience in Melbourne and hopes to achieve \u201csustained disruption\u201d.\n\nmedia_camera Police arrested more than 70 people during the Extinction Rebellion protests.\n\nMORE NEWS\n\nTHREE-MONTH RAIL SHUTDOWN SET TO STING COMMUTERS\n\nCONCERNS FOR RETAILERS AHEAD OF PLASTIC BAG BAN\n\nSTARK REMINDER FOR AUSSIE MEN THIS MOVEMBER\n\nAccording to a statement, the group has released a \u201cpreliminary schedule\u201d for the protests which will kick off on Monday.\n\n\u201cBlockade IMARC Alliance organisers aim to use mass civil disobedience to disrupt the climate and corporate criminals,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt is expected the IMARC campaign will be bigger than the recent Extinction Rebellion demonstrations.\n\nThat round of activity closed major CBD intersections as those involved tried to push the climate change message.", "description": "Protesters have shut down traffic in the CBD and blockaded a Oceana Golds Collins St headquarters.
