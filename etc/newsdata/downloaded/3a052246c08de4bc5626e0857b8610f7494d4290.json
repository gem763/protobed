We are unable to comment further on this matter whilst the investigation is ongoing.\"\n\nThe RO did confirm to NPR that the alleged behavior was, in its opinion, serious enough to immediately replace Grigorio on the Japan tour; for the company's final performance in Yokohama, Japan, on Sunday, Russian tenor Georgy Vasiliev stepped into Grigorio's place.\n\nGrigolo's manager declined to comment to NPR, citing the RO's open investigation.\n\nThe Italian tenor made splashy, nearly back-to-back operatic debuts in 2010, first at the Royal Opera and then at New York's Metropolitan Opera. He has tried to cultivate parallel careers both on the opera stage and in the crossover world; he was an early, though short-lived, member of Simon Cowell's \"popera\" group Il Divo.\n\nAs a solo artist, Grigolo has most recently recorded for Sony Masterworks. He has also become a frequent presence at New York's Metropolitan Opera, which is currently fending off criticism \u2014 including from some of its own employees and from outside the opera house \u2014 for its commitment to feature opera megastar Pl\u00e1cido Domingo in a run of performances of Verdi's Macbeth, beginning Wednesday night. Domingo has been publicly accused of sexual misconduct by 20 women.\n\nGrigolo's next scheduled U.S. appearance is in February; he is slated to star in Verdi's La Traviata at the Met.", "description": "The 42-year-old singer was removed from a Royal Opera tour of Japan after alleged sexual misconduct.
