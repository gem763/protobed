Evans told the Times she was concerned with how rapidly children were recommended for hormone treatment at the clinic, which some experts say can have serious medical risks, including loss of fertility and the ability to have an orgasm. Families are not made aware of some of those dangers, Evans said.\n\n\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Experiment on kids\u2019: Cross-sex hormone therapy age down to 8 in US govt-funded study, doctor finds\n\nMrs. A \u2013 who said she wanted to remain anonymous to protect her child\u2019s identity \u2013 expressed concern that \u201cno one, let alone my daughter, understands the risk\u201d of the hormone procedure, which she called an \u201cexperimental treatment.\u201d Proper informed consent cannot be obtained under those conditions, she added.\n\nThere are many parents, like me, who are anxiously trying to support their children \u2026 We want the best for our children, but we need this to be from a position of evidence-based, not experimental, medicine.\n\n\n\nOn its website, Tavistock describes its GIDS program as a \u201chighly specialised clinic for young people presenting with difficulties with their gender identity.\u201d However, the facility has increasingly come under fire in recent months over concerns doctors there were misleading patients and rushing them into potentially dangerous treatments.\n\nIn an open letter published over the summer directed at Tavistock head Polly Carmichael, another former employee at the clinic, psychologist Kirsty Entwistle, said the center was moving too fast with too little evidence.\n\n\u201cIt is a problem that GIDS clinicians are making decisions that will have a major impact on children and young people\u2019s bodies and on their lives, potentially the rest of their lives, without a robust evidence base,\u201d Entwistle wrote.\n\n\n\nAlso on rt.com 17 children from one UK school, majority with autism, in \u2018process of changing their gender\u2019\n\nThe Tavistock clinic said it would not comment on any pending legal matters in a statement to the Times.\n\n\u201cIt is not appropriate for us to comment in detail in advance of any proposed legal proceedings,\u201d the clinic said. \u201cThe GIDS is one of the longest-established services of its type in the world with an international reputation for being cautious and considered.\u201d\n\n\n\nLike this story?
