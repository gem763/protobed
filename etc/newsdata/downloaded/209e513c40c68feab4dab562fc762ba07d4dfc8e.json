As if that result wasn\u2019t tough enough \u2014 we lost Keira Walsh to a straight red card with 20 minutes to go. Now we\u2019re without a win in three games after Sunday\u2019s defeat at Arsenal in the FA Women\u2019s Super League.\n\nAs a group, we simply must go back to basics after the 1-0 defeat by Arsenal\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time I have experienced moments like this. Back in 2016 \u2014 the year we won the title \u2014 we had a bare XI, plus some development players on the bench.\n\nWe didn\u2019t have luck on our side but still got our hands on the trophy. Times like these can help build belief.\n\nI remember coming to Meadow Park in my early 20s when I was playing for Everton. I was on the end of some heavy defeats and it hurt so much I even contemplated retirement, despite still being very young.\n\nLast season when Arsenal lifted the title in front of their home fans after our 1-0 defeat, it felt like we\u2019d all been invited to a party we didn\u2019t want to attend. They had won the title before a ball had been kicked.\n\nA strike from Vivianne Miedema was enough for Arsenal to secure a 1-0 win over Man City\n\nIt\u2019s the moment I used to try and drive us on. Sometimes you need to go through those experiences. Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema is a forward who drifts in and out of a game.\n\nShe\u2019s not like City\u2019s England striker Ellen White, who will hunt down defenders, but has such an eye for goal. Give her time and space and you know Miedema is going to find the back of the net.\n\nWe got punished for doing just that, just before half-time. We have to be on it in every game in this League but perhaps we haven\u2019t been of late. It\u2019s time to get back to basics. Our defensive shape was better against Arsenal but we paid the price for not creating enough opportunities.\n\nWhite was one of our biggest signings this summer and it was great to see her come on as a sub in the second half, but we can\u2019t pile pressure on her. Ellen\u2019s been out for a few months and it would be unfair to expect instant results.\n\nWe have to create more chances if we\u2019re going to get a win against Atletico Madrid in the second leg of our last 16 tie on Wednesday. Win in Spain and it will give the team that little bit of extra belief.\n\nAs told to Claire Bloomfield", "description": "JILL SCOTT AT MEADOW PARK: It seems everything that could go wrong is going wrong at the moment for us at Manchester City.\u00a0First the late draw with Atletico Madrid in Europe.", "authors": ["Jill Scott For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/23/20258890-0-image-a-108_1572217610656.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
