Turner was found guilty of three felonies for sexually assaulting her outside an on-campus fraternity party in January 2015, and served only three months in county jail.\n\n\u201cI was in shock,\u201d Miller says. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying I just put aside a year and a half of my life so he could go to county jail for three months.\u201d\n\nMiller, who lives in San Francisco and holds a degree in literature from the University of California, Santa Barbara, adds: \u201cThere are young men, particularly young men of color, serving longer sentences for non-violent crimes, for having a teeny bit of marijuana in their pocket. And he\u2019s just been convicted of three felonies \u2026 one month for each felony. How can you explain that to me?\u201d\n\nMariah Tiffany More\n\nAt the 2016 hearing, Miller read a victim-impact statement that quickly went viral online and was viewed by 11 million people in four days. \u201cIn newspapers, my name was \u2018unconscious, intoxicated woman.\u2019 Ten syllables, and nothing more than that. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty with so much at stake,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cIt is enough to be suffering,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity of validity of this suffering\u2026. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Stanford Sex Assault Survivor Reads From Inspiring Victim Impact Statement That Went Viral\n\nDetailing the aftermath of the attack to 60 Minutes, Miller says, \u201c[Rape] is not a punishment for getting drunk. And we have this really sick mindset in our culture, as if you deserve rape if you drink to excess.\n\nShe adds, \u201cYou deserve a hangover, a really bad hangover, but you don\u2019t deserve to have somebody insert their body parts inside of you.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s full interview with 60 Minutes airs Sunday at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT on CBS.\n\nMiller\u2019s new memoir, Know My Name, is set to be released on Sept. 24.", "description": "Chanel Miller: 'Rape Is Not a Punishment for Getting Drunk'", "authors": ["Tom Gliatto"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gsXh2pwmBwWn96EE0vLojA--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/tardis/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeopledotcom.files.wordpress.com%2F2019%2F09%2Fchanel-miller-photo-credit-mariah-tiffany.jpg&w=1000&f=jpg&q=80", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
