(AP) - Antoine Winfield Jr. spoiled Fresno State\u2019s bid for a Power 5 win for a second straight year.\n\nWinfield intercepted a pass in the end zone in the second overtime to preserve Minnesota\u2019s 38-35 come-from-behind victory over Fresno State on Saturday night with his second game-sealing interception in as many years against the Bulldogs.\n\n\u201cIt was very similar. It was like deja vu. I remember seeing the quarterback throw the ball again and I was able to make a quick speed turn and I was able to make the play,\u201d Winfield said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they probably hate me right now.\u201d\n\nThe Golden Gophers (2-0) tied the game twice late with Tanner Morgan throwing a 20-yard TD pass to Chris Autman-Bell on fourth down in the final minute of regulation and Morgan then scoring on a 4-yard keeper in the first overtime.\n\nMichael Lantz then made a 37-yard field goal for the Gophers on the opening possession of the second overtime before Winfield intercepted Jorge Reyna\u2019s pass to Cam Sutton to send Fresno State (0-2) to the loss.\n\n\u201cWhen that ball was floating in the air, I saw (Winfield) breaking on it and we all knew what was going to happen,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big-time player and he made a big-time play in a big-time situation.\u201d\n\nThis was the second straight week Fresno State lost on a late interception in the end zone, with Reyna throwing one last week in a 31-23 loss at Southern California.\n\n\u201cIt was there,\u201d coach Jeff Tedford said. \u201cA little too much air on the ball but I don\u2019t think there was anything wrong with the call. We just didn\u2019t execute it the way we need to. Just something we saved for this game if we got into that situation so unfortunate it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nIt was there.

Just something we saved for this game if we got into that situation so unfortunate it didn\u2019t work out\n\nThe overtime followed a roller-coaster fourth quarter that started with Minnesota tying the game on Mohamed Ibrahim\u2019s 1-yard run early in the quarter. Fresno State went back ahead on Reyna\u2019s 2-yard run with 5:58 remaining following a muffed punt by Demetrius Douglas.\n\nBut the Gophers weren\u2019t done, surviving two fumbles on the drive to tie the game at 28-all with 46 seconds remaining on Morgan\u2019s pass to Autman-Bell.\n\n\u201cWe just ran a quick slant and go,\u201d coach P.J. Fleck said. \u201cThat was our only shot. He hadn\u2019t had a touchdown yet in a year and a half and here it is. It couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\u201d\n\nThe teams then traded touchdowns in the first overtime with Reyna throwing a 5-yard TD pass to Ronnie Rivers a play after a roughing the passer penalty extended the Fresno State drive.\n\nMorgan then answered with a 4-yard keeper that tied the game at 35.\n\nMorgan threw for 234 yards and two touchdowns. Ibrahim and Rodney Smith ran for scores for the Gophers.\n\nReyna completed 24 of 35 passes for 288 yards and three TD passes.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nMinnesota: It hasn\u2019t been easy but the Gophers have opened the season with back-to-back wins to extend the nation\u2019s longest nonconference winning streak to 17 games. Minnesota rallied in the fourth quarter to beat FCS-level South Dakota State 28-21 in the opener and came back to win on the road against a tougher Fresno State team in Week 2.\n\nFresno State: The Bulldogs have started the season 0-2 for the first time since 2014 by losing to Power 5 teams in Southern California and Minnesota. Fresno State hasn\u2019t been outclassed in either one. The Bulldogs nearly mounted an impressive comeback at USC last week before Reyna threw a late interception in the end zone with his team driving for the potential tying score. Fresno State then couldn\u2019t stop the fourth-and-13 play against Minnesota.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMinnesota: Host Georgia Southern next Saturday.\n\nFresno State: Host Sacramento State on Sept. 21.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antoine Winfield Jr. spoiled Fresno State's bid for a Power 5 win for a second straight year.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/minnesota_fresno_st_football_07462_c0-131-2000-1297_s1770x1032.jpg?16e1cc2c567490b58a148ed9e5e11707dec97c14", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
