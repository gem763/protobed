Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nIn Miss Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s case, she will, during each year of her two-year term in Congress, receive $174,000 a year in salary. By prioritizing her personnel budget, she would be able to substantially reduce her debt. She could have more meals at home, fewer social outings, wear a far less expensive wardrobe and the like. Miss Ocasio-Cortez made a decision to obtain a loan in order to attend an expensive university so that she could obtain a degree which is of little commercial value. She entered into a legal, enforceable contract as an adult. She could have transferred to a more affordable college or university and obtained a professional rather than a political degree.\n\nMiss Ocasio-Cortez seems to think she is entitled to anything she so desires without regard to consequence. It is that attitude, not the obligation to repay outstanding student-loan debt, which is the problem \u2014 one she brought upon herself.\n\nMIKE McADOO\n\nSan Francisco\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
