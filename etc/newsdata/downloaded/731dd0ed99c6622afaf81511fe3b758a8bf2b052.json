I am sure we have all done that.\n\nIn a post on the school's Facebook page (pictured) on Sunday evening Ms Cathie reminded parents how important conversation is for a child's brain development\n\n'The smiles on their faces when they notice you on the playground. Often running to you and starting a conversation before you can hear them over the buzz of other people's conversations.'\n\nShe adds: 'Please take a moment to listen and talk to your child. The power of talk has a huge impact on our children's language development - it stimulates brain development.\n\n'Their wisdom grows, their vocabulary becomes richer, and they develop curiosity, critical thinking and intelligence.\n\n'In addition it supports a child to develop a good mental health.'\n\nThe primary school, which is taking part in Thursday's Hello Yellow day to raise money for YoungMinds, offers yoga as a PE option and 'does a lot of mindfulness', Ms Cathie says.\n\nSome parents are so engrossed in their phones they don't even greet their children with a 'hello', instead choosing to 'just walk off', expecting their child to follow, Ms Cathie says (file)\n\n'There was one parent on her phone yesterday so I just said \"excuse me, we're now a mobile-free school\" and she just said \"oh right, sorry\",' she added.\n\nAs for how they might deal with any conflict, she said: 'Ultimately the school belongs to us, it's our rules, so we'll just ask them nicely and hope the message gets across.\n\n'Ultimately it's about the children and while they're in our care and our boundaries, that's what we're going to be asking for.'", "description": "Wendy Cathie, a mother-of-three, and headteacher at St Peter's CE Primary School, Leigh, in Manchester, announced the new rules on social media at the weekend.", "authors": ["Emer Scully For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/21/19459532-0-image-a-6_1570566270035.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
