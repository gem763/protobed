Then she learned federal loans come with an origination fee that private loans typically don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d says Trevino, 52, from Victoria, Texas. \u201cMy assumption was [federal loans] would be the best, easiest option for school.\u201d\n\nFederal loans typically are that best, easiest option, and fees have minimal effect on these loans for undergraduates. But parents, like Trevino, as well as graduate students \u2014 who typically borrow larger amounts at higher interest rates \u2014 pay much more.\n\nThe federal government has charged about $8.3 billion in origination fees since 2013, according to the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, with almost one-third coming from parent borrowers.\n\nHere\u2019s what borrowers should know about these fees.\n\nHow much are student loan origination fees?\n\nAn origination fee is money you pay to offset a lender\u2019s costs for issuing a loan. This fee is expressed as a percentage of the loan\u2019s total.\n\nOrigination fees are currently 1.062% for federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans for undergraduate and graduate students. Fees are 4.248% for federal PLUS loans for parents and graduate students. These percentages change annually on Oct. 1.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why fewer students are enrolling in college\n\nOrigination fees are taken from the loan amount before the funds are applied to your education costs.\n\nFor example, say you take out $16,450 in PLUS loans \u2014 the average amount parents borrow annually, according to the most recent data from the College Board. With a fee of 4.248%, roughly $15,750 of that loan would go to the school and $700 would go to the federal government.\n\n\u2018Unnecessary and unfair\u2019\n\nEven though you don\u2019t use that $700, you still repay it \u2014 plus interest. Over four years in school, that\u2019s $2,800 a borrower would owe in fees alone.\n\nLori Vedder, director of financial aid at the University of Michigan-Flint, says that students and families are often confused when they find out they must repay money they never received.\n\n\u201cThis is something that is unnecessary and unfair to students,\u201d says Vedder.\n\nIt can seem especially unfair to PLUS loans borrowers. At 7.08%, PLUS loans have a higher interest rate than the 4.53% of other undergraduate federal loans. PLUS borrowers can also take out more \u2014 up to the cost of attendance, minus other aid received, with no aggregate maximum.\n\nAs part of her daughter\u2019s financial-aid package at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, Trevino was offered a $13,950 parent PLUS loan, which would have an origination fee of $593.\n\nThat\u2019s $593 Trevino, a single mother, could put toward other education expenses. It nearly meets the $780 cost of books and supplies at Texas State, based on the latest estimate from the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nAlso read: The true cost of that student loan\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely made me think that I need to do some more research,\u201d Trevino says. She\u2019s considering private loan options.\n\nPrivate loans may lack origination fees \u2014 and protections\n\nAll federal student loans have origination fees, and schools don\u2019t have the ability to waive these costs.\n\nJustin Draeger, president and CEO of NASFAA, says parents and families really can\u2019t do anything about these fees \u201cexcept to realize upfront that the amount they\u2019re [borrowing] won\u2019t be the same amount they receive.\u201d\n\nBut private student loans are a potential alternative. Most private loans don\u2019t charge origination fees and may offer lower interest rates than federal loans, depending on your financial situation.\n\nVedder says this route could make sense in some cases, like a parent with excellent credit who\u2019s planning to take a PLUS loan. However, she cautions borrowers to proceed carefully, even if private loans offer potential savings.\n\n\u201cFederal loans have built-in protections private loans typically do not,\u201d she says.\n\nSee: Here\u2019s why America\u2019s $1.5 trillion student-loan crisis has spiraled out of control\n\nThese protections include options that can postpone or forgive your loans in certain situations, as well as repayment plans that let you pay based on your income.\n\nLegislation seeks to eliminate fees\n\nFederal loans offer unmatched borrower protections and programs, but they make the government money via origination fees. Draeger says this doesn\u2019t make sense for a public benefit program.\n\nThese fees were once part of the Federal Family Education Loan Program, which used private lenders to issue federal loans and charged these fees to subsidize the lenders\u2019 costs.\n\nThe FFEL program ended in 2010, but the fees remain.\n\nBipartisan legislation was introduced into the House and Senate earlier this year to eliminate origination fees. Draeger advises borrowers to write their representatives to support this change.\n\n\u201cThis is literally just an extra tax on needy student borrowers,\u201d Draeger says.\n\nIn a statement to NerdWallet, a U.S. Department of Education spokesman said that origination fees are now used to reduce the overall costs of the federal student aid program.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "The federal government has charged about $8.3 billion in origination fees since 2013.", "authors": ["Ryan Lane"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ711_nerd_s_ZG_20190904175251.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
