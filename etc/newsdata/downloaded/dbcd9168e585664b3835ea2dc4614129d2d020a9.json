Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani and a Zelenskiy aide, Andrey Yermak, also make brief appearances in the correspondence.\n\nThe conversations leave no doubt that the state department was deeply involved in the effort to use the office of the presidency to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump\u2019s political enemies. At one point the diplomats even draft a statement for Zelenskiy to read out.\n\nThe early conversations come before a 25 July phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy that was the trigger for the impeachment proceedings now consuming Congress. They show that Sondland coached Zelenskiy on the call, making clear what would be required from him.\n\n\u201cI [spoke] to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He\u2019s got it,\u201d Sondland, a major donor to Trump and the Republican party, texted Volker.\n\nVolker replied: \u201cMost [important] is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation \u2013 and address any specific personnel issues \u2013 if there are any.\u201d\n\nFor their part, the Ukrainians were quite aware about what was happening and were deeply uneasy about what they were being asked to do. They made their concerns clear to Bill Taylor, who had taken on the acting ambassador\u2019s job in May.\n\nI [spoke] to Zelensky and gave him a full briefing. He\u2019s got it Gordon Sondland\n\n\u201cGordon, one thing Kurt and I talked about yesterday was [Ukranian finance minister] Sasha Danyliuk\u2019s point that President Zelensky is sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic , reelection politics,\u201d Taylor wrote to Sondland on 21 July.\n\nSondland, the Trump donor and ambassador to the EU, brushes aside the concerns, arguing they had to move forward \u201cirrespective of the pretext.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am worried about the alternative,\u201d he added, in a likely reference to a dramatic worsening in relations.\n\n'He tried to have his cake and eat it': how Trump's Ukraine envoy lost his big gamble Read more\n\nOn 25 July, just before the Trump-Zelenskiy call, Volker texted Yermak, the Zelenskiy aide: \u201cHeard from White House \u2013 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate/ \u201cget to the bottom of what happened\u201d in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\u201d\n\nTrump and his supporters have sought to create a counter-narrative to the US intelligence community finding that Russia intervened in the 2016 US election in Trump\u2019s favour. According to the counter-narrative, the real interference came from Ukrainian oligarchs and was in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favour. There is no evidence for the theory, but the launch of an investigation by Kyiv would have given it credence.\n\nAfter the 25 July presidential call, Yermak confirmed it \u201cwent well\u201d and Trump told Zelenskiy to pick a date for his White House visit. However, a final agreement was clearly delayed. By 9 August Sondland told Volker the White House was ready to confirm the visit \u201cas soon as Yermak confirms\u201d. He added: \u201cI think potus [Trump] really wants the deliverable.\u201d\n\nSondland suggests asking Yermak to forward a draft of what Zelenskiy is going to say. On the same day, Volker checked in with Giuliani and told him about the statement the Ukrainian president is going to make.\n\n\u201cCan we all get on the phone to make sure I advise Z correctly as to what he should be saying? Want to make sure we get this done right,\u201d Volker said. Giuliani agreed.\n\nThe next day, it was clear the Ukrainians were nervous about trusting Trump and ask for the date of the White House visit to be announced before Zelenskiy made his statement.\n\nEchoes of the Nixon tapes? The transcripts that could doom Trump Read more\n\n\u201cOnce we have a date, will call for a press briefing announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-Ukraine relationship, including among other things Burisma [the energy corporation on which Hunter Biden was a board member] and election meddling in investigations [a likely garble for investigation into election meddling],\u201d Yermak suggests.\n\nOn the same day, Volker presented a US draft of what Zelenskiy should say to Sondland.\n\n\u201cSpecial attention should be paid to the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States, especially with the alleged involvement of some Ukrainian politicians. I want to declare that this is unacceptable,\u201d the draft statement said. \u201cWe intend to initiate and complete a transparent and unbiased investigation of all available facts and episodes, including those involving Burisma and the 2016 US elections, which in turn will prevent the recurrence of this problem in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Let\u2019s send to Andrey after our call,\u201d Sondland replied.\n\nHowever, the plan to exchange Zelenskiy\u2019s statement for a White House visit was torpedoed when the Ukrainians read a report on the Politico news site, that Trump had blocked $250 million in military aid to Ukraine, as well as state department funding.\n\nThe news made the Ukrainians even more skittish. Taylor, increasingly uneasy himself, asked Sondland directly: \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations.\u201d\n\nIn reply, Sondland told him to call to get a reply, instead of texting.\n\nTaylor wrote to both Sondland and Volker to express his shared misgivings with the Kyiv government, that Zelenskiy would make his statement this time in the form of an interview, but that Ukraine would still not receive the military aid.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (and I quit.)\u201d Taylor warned.\n\nThe last published text is dated 9 September and is between a distressed Taylor and Sondland.\n\n\u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario,\u201d Taylor said, adding: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland\u2019s reply was startling. Throughout the text dialogue he had taken the lead in arranging the original quid pro quo, Ukrainian help in investigating Biden\u2019s company and the 2016 election, in return for a White House visit.\n\nBut on 9 September , as if he had become newly aware of the high stakes of leaving a digital trail of the conversation, Sondland adopted a suddenly formal tone and reverted to the official line. By that time, the White House had become aware that a complaint about the 25 July presidential phone call was in the pipeline, and that it was likely to cause a scandal.\n\n\u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he told Taylor.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Newly-released texts show diplomats made clear that improvement in Kyiv\u2019s relations with Washington was linked to cooperation", "authors": ["Julian Borger", "Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a98b66ef375b42b5a0d28f363da04e4c2580856/0_49_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a45e79c5b2a1b18768633aee6c78200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
