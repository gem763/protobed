The basic rules of our democracy are under attack, from the president.\u201d\n\nNoting that the president openly admitted to seeking foreign influence in the 2020 election, the Meet the Press host pointed out that thus far \u201cRepublicans have been silent on what we have seen from the president.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the president\u2019s remarks, Todd then expressed his belief that we are entering an extremely dark moment in our nation's history.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is using the power of his office to solicit interference in the 2020 presidential election\u2014while doing it relying on a debunked conspiracy or two,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not hearsay or a whistleblower\u2019s complaint or a memorandum of a phone conversation. You heard the president do it himself on the White House lawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis moment should arguably be a national emergency\u2014the founding fathers would have considered it a national emergency if the president publicly lobbied multiple foreign governments to interfere in the next election,\u201d Todd added.\n\nOnce again noting that the GOP has failed to condemn Trump, Todd concluded that this was \u201cremarkable considering the precedent it would set and the lasting damage it would do to our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is tough to say lightly,\u201d he sighed. \u201cBut this is the moment we are at.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
