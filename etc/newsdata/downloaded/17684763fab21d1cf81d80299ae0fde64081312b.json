The same could be said for the Namibian rugby team, which carries the name of the plant found surviving in harsh conditions in the Namib desert on the country\u2019s west coast. There are only 800 registered senior rugby players and just seven senior clubs, all based in Windhoek or in the town of Rehoboth, 70km from the capital. It is truly remarkable that they will be participating in their sixth consecutive World Cup.\n\nIn 2015 Namibia\u2019s coach Danie Vermeulen resigned only months out from the World Cup as a result of boardroom struggles. He was replaced by the former Wales international Phil Davies. Davies took the team to England where they produced their best ever performance despite not securing a first win. They came within a point of drawing with Georgia in Exeter and earned their first ever World Cup bonus point. The next four years though would be as fraught with political infighting if not worse than before.\n\nNamibia confirmed their place at Japan 2019 with a 53-28 win over Kenya in August 2018. The result said more about the state of rugby on the continent than it did about the strength of Namibian rugby. Two Test matches in the Nations Cup in Montevideo in June yielded mixed results, including a first victory over Uruguay after a 30-28 win. That was also Namibia\u2019s last international outing and there are legitimate concerns that they will be going into the World Cup under-prepared with only two outings against the Pro 14 Southern Kings.\n\nIf the lead-in has not been hard enough, the Namibians will be the first to admit that chances of a World Cup win against any of their first three opponents \u2013 Italy, South Africa and New Zealand \u2013 are less than zero. Their final pool match against Canada on 13 October will be their best and possibly last chance ever of recording a win at the World Cup.\n\nWhen Namibia named their 31-man squad Davies produced a shock by omitting the former captain Renaldo Bothma. The Harlequins forward last played for Namibia against Spain in November but was still regarded as one of the best Namibian players. Bothma announced his retirement from international rugby on Twitter the day before the team was finalised but Davies did confirm that the former Bulls player was simply not selected.\n\nThe squad will be led by Johan Deysel who plays for Colomiers in the Pro D2 in France. Davies has assembled a group that mainly consists of locally based players, including scrum-half Eugene Jantjies who will make his fourth World Cup appearance. Centre Darryl de la Harpe, lock PJ van Lill and loose-forward Rohan Kitshoff all played in the 2011 and 2015 editions. Kitshoff is one of many players in the squad who holds down a full-time job.\n\nNamibia desperately need a win in Japan to ensure the future of the game. Already there is strong talk that they will lose their sponsors post World Cup and it is debatable whether rugby\u2019s authorities will continue to pour money into a rugby programme besieged by infighting and boardroom squabbles. The Namibians are a tough and resilient lot, very much like the Welwitschia plant, but it is a near impossible task to ensure they return home with their first ever World Cup victory.\n\n\u2022 David van der Sandt is a freelance rugby correspondent.
