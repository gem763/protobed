Elijah Cummings.\n\nBut then again, maybe Obama missed the headlines of Trudeau\u2019s blackface? There were only, like \u2014 5,000. And guess what: More are probably on their way.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau Admits There Could Be More Blackface Photos,\u201d Time wrote on Sept. 19.\n\nThe piece goes on to report how Trudeau said \u201che\u2019s unsure whether there are more images of him in blackface or brownface\u201d will emerge in the coming weeks \u2014 more than the three that have already been published, that is. A video from the early 1990s showing Trudeau in blackface, with hands raised and tongue protruding, has gone viral in recent times. Then there was the photo of him in brownface at a party at a school at which he was employed in 2001. Then there was his admission about a high school performance he gave years before, while wearing blackface.\n\nOh me oh my.\n\nIf Trudeau were conservative, his political career would now be at a crashed halt.\n\nAs it is, as luck would have it, he\u2019s liberal. And not just your run-of-the-mill liberal \u2014 a far-left, pie-in-the-sky, hands-in-the-taxpayers\u2019-pockets kind of liberal with big liberal friends in other countries.\n\nFriends like Obama.\n\nFriends like Obama who just tweeted: \u201cI was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as [p]resident. He\u2019s a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs [Trudeau\u2019s] progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term.\u201d\n\nTrudeau responded with a tweet of his own: \u201cThanks my friend, we\u2019re working hard to keep our progress going.\u201d\n\nAww, isn\u2019t that special \u2014 the black Obama and the blackfacing Trudeau, hands across borders. Forgive and forget, to forgive is divine, and all that. Kind of like how Democrats on America\u2019s more domestic front turn kind, forgiving eyes toward Virginia\u2019s blackfacing governor, Ralph Northam.\n\nWho knew leftists were so tolerant of acts they sling as abject racism when they\u2019re conducted by those of opposing political views?\n\nBut of course, they\u2019re not.\n\nThis Obama endorsement of Trudeau is yet one more example of liberal hypocrisy \u2014 yet one more showing of how leftists will use the race card only when it benefits.\n\nIf something is racist, it ought to be racist for all, not just those with opposing political views. Not just for the sake of political expediency.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
