Others agreed.\n\nAs digital clocks take over, people get less practice telling time on an analogue clock. We\u2019ll help. Here are two ways to read a clock: the precise way, and the quick way.\n\nKnow your hands\n\nAll the hands on a clock move \u201cclockwise\u201d \u2014 to the right on top, to the left on bottom, counting up from 1 to 12.\n\nThe shortest hand is the hour hand. The last number it passed is the hour (like 5-something, or 12-something).\n\nThe longer hand is the minute hand. To tell the current minute, multiply the last number the hand passed by 5, and add the number of notches the hand has passed since passing that number. So if the minute hand is three notches past the 8, then the minute is (8*5)+3, or 43.\n\nSometimes there\u2019s a skinny second hand. It works the same as the minute hand, but for seconds. Ignore it.\n\nKnow the stations of the clock\n\nIf you only need to know the approximate time, then memorise the four main points of the clock: When the minute hand is pointing straight up, it\u2019s something o\u2019clock. When it points straight to the right, it\u2019s 15 minutes past the hour. Straight down to the bottom is 30 minutes past, and straight left is 45 past.\n\nThose four points are the 12, 3, 6 and 9. But pay more attention to the spots, so you can still read a clock if it has Roman numerals or no numbers at all \u2014 as many elegant clocks do.\n\nAnd more and more, the only clocks you\u2019ll see are elegant decorative ones, as more workaday analogue clocks are replaced with digital ones that can be efficiently controlled, or programmed to update for daylight saving time.\n\nLuckily, that means that when you have just an analogue clock, you probably need to know about what time it is, not exactly what time. And for that, you only need the hour hand: What number is it close to, and how close is it? For a little more precision, what general part of the hour is the minute hand pointing to?\n\nFor anything more precise, find a phone. Phones know the real time, after all. While analogue clocks \u2014 and a lot of digital clocks \u2014 need to be manually set and are often a minute or two off the real time, most phones are precisely correct.", "description": "\u201cTook me until my early twenties to learn how to read an analogue clock, and it is still very difficult,\u201d says Lifehacker reader Albert Peters, commenting on our post about basic life skills.
