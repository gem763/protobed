Click on the popes below to highlight their trips outside of Italy over the past 50 years.\n\nJohn Paul II visited 129 countries \u2013 more than all other popes combined. His historic speech in Poland, long considered a precipitant to the fall of Soviet rule there, marked the first of nine trips to his native country. In all, he traveled approximately 721,000 miles, an equivalent of 31 times around the earth, according to an estimate by John Trigilio. Paul VI visited 15 countries before ceasing travel after being stabbed in the Manila airport in 1970. He expanded the pope\u2019s international presence as the first to leave Europe in over a century, and the first to fly.\n\nSince the start of his papacy in 2013, Francis has visited 16 countries, with a focus on his native continent of South America and Asia.\n\nPhoto credits: Stan Wayman\u2014The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images, Paul J.
