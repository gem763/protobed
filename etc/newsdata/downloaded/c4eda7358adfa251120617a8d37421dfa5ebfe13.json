I\u2019m so fucking glad we got Osuna.\u201d\n\nAnother Astros team staffer later apologized to the women for the rant.\n\nAstros president of baseball operations Jeff Luhnow said Taubman\u2019s behavoir \u201cwas inappropriate and not representative of who the Astros are and our culture and what we stand for.\u201d\n\nHe also said the team was wrong in an initial statement describing Taubman\u2019s actions as being supportive of Osuna while he faced tough questions over his play \u2014 when other reporters confirmed no such situation existed when Taubman\u2019s rant began.\n\n\u201cThat original reaction by the Astros was wrong and we own it as an organization,\u201d Luhnow said. \u201cThere were many people involved in reviewing that and approving that. And I\u2019m not going to get into the details of that. It was wrong. It was the Astros\u2019 decision and that\u2019s where I\u2019m going to leave that.\u201d\n\nThe Astros first statement had slammed Sports Illustrated journalist Stephanie Apstein\u2019s account of the exchange as \u201cmisleading and completely irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur initial investigation led us to believe that Brandon Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were not directed toward any reporter,\u201d the team said.\n\n\u201cWe were wrong. We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct,\u201d the team statement said.\n\n\u201cThe Astros in no way intended to minimise the issues related to domestic violence.\n\n\u201cOur initial belief was based on witness statements about the incident. Subsequent interviews have revealed that Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were, in fact, directed toward one or more reporters.\u201d\n\nPressed on the first club statement, Luhnow added, \u201cIt was an organizational statement. There was nobody\u2019s name on it\u2026 it was wrong, it was incorrect. It should never have been sent out. We\u2019ve learned a lesson about it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about that first statement that was correct or that\u2019s defensible. And we take accountability for it, we take ownership of it, and it was wrong.\u201d\n\nTaubman had reportedly clashed with one of the reporters in the past over the Astros\u2019 controversial recruitment of Osuna.\n\nThe 24-year-old pitcher was suspended for 75 games in 2018 after allegedly assaulting the mother of his child. He was later signed by the Astros from the Toronto Blue Jays.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 The Houston Astros have fired an executive who taunted a group of female reporters about a member of the team who had been banned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/25/68ea0d_houston-astros-pitcher-roberto-osuna-who-was-signed-by-team-in-2018-hit-by-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
