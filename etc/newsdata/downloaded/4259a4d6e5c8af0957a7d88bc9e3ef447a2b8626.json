Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) October 24, 2019\n\nThe Times\u2019 article paints a fearful account of rising uninsurance rates among eligible Medicaid families due to amended paperwork requirements and deportation fears, and implies shifts in policy under the Trump administration are behind the decreasing enrollment. But HHS Administration for Children and Families spokesman told the paper that recent rises are due to factors in individual states.\n\n\u201cI went to the E.R. thinking he had insurance. If the receptionist had not seen him turning blue, she might have just said, \u2018He\u2019s not covered, so we can\u2019t see him today.\u2019 I do think about that.,\u201d Karen Johnson, the boy\u2019s mother, told The Times. The nine-month old was taken to the intensive care unit for a respiratory virus, treated successfully, and later released.\n\nThe rest of the story also undercuts Omar\u2019s initial tweet, as the Times reports that \u201cTrump administration officials have not explicitly tried to limit children\u2019s Medicaid coverage.\u201d After an appointment with an enrollment counselor, it was revealed that Johnson had missed a window to provide proof of income to re-enroll her three children.\n\nThe Johnson\u2019s are now re-enrolled successfully, and Karen is counting on Medicaid to cover the hospital bills retroactively.\n\nMedicaid retroactively covers eligible patients up to three months after the month of application.", "description": "After critics pointed out Omar\u2019s inaccuracy on Twitter, her account tweeted an addendum saying the child had \u201calmost died.\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Ilya Shapiro", "Kevin D.
