There are places where people are straight-up rude because they don't really care.\n\n'They already get a high paying job, which by the way let's talk about how in Australia minimum wage is like $25 an hour - in America where I live, it's like $7.25 an hour.'\n\nThe British student has shared the bizarre things she wished she knew before she moved to Australia - including rude waiters, slangs and expensive food\n\nCockroaches\n\nElizabeth said she found cockroaches everywhere when she was living in Sydney.\n\n'Cockroaches are everywhere, all the time... The heat just like draws them inside and the water also attracts to it,' she said.\n\n'It doesn't matter if you have a thousand bottles of bug spray and you get your house sprayed like three times a month, like it's not going to matter because cockroaches are insane and they're everywhere here.'\n\nTalking fast\n\nShe said another thing she found challenging was listening to Australians talk.\n\n'People here tend to say things really fast and in one breath,' she said.\n\n'So like one for example is \"We'll be right\". What? What does that even mean? \"Will be right\" - we'll be all right.\n\n'Or \"how are you going\" - they say \"how you going\" instead of \"how are you doing\" or like how \"what's up\". They go really fast \"how are you going\" like in one breath, it's so weird.'\n\nShe said another thing she found challenging was listening to Australians talk 'really fast'\n\nExpensive food\n\nElizabeth said when she lived in Sydney, she found 'everything was overpriced'.\n\n'No matter what you're getting, it's probably going to be a little more expensive than what you're used to if you're from a different place,' she said.\n\n'Like in America, you could probably get a burger at a good restaurant for about $7, here it will be about $14. Obviously thinking about exchange rates but everything is super expensive here especially in Sydney.\n\n'I'm not sure about other places but Sydney is one of the top most expensive cities in the world to live so everything is just way more expensive than you expect to pay for.\n\n'I thought that was really interesting. It's not really fun because I'm a college student who wants to travel the world... I don't really want to spend money.'\n\nElizabeth said when she lived in Sydney, she found 'everything was overpriced', including food\n\nSeasons\n\nElizabeth said another thing she found interesting was the seasons in Australia were 'reversed', compared to America.\n\n'In Australia, summer is December to February, autumn is March to May, winter is June to August and spring is September to November so it's super opposite from America,' she said.\n\n'In America, autumn is September to November, winter is December to March, spring is March to June and then summer is June to the end of August - September.\n\n'But basically it's really confusing because it's total opposites - when I go back to America in December and it's summer here so I'm like dressed in summer clothes - I go home and it's like freezing so I got like culture shock and my skin's like what's happening so it's really interesting.'\n\nDriving on the left side\n\nElizabeth said another thing she found unusual was how Australian drivers drive on the left side of the road - the same goes with walking on the footpath.\n\n'Everybody here drives on the opposite side of the road so it's really interesting. The steering wheel is on the right side and you drive on the left side,' she said.\n\n'Whereas America, it's reversed. My brain is kind of going crazy right now, I'm having like a cultural brain fart. What's really funny is when people walk past you in Australia, they actually walk past the way that they drive.\n\n'You can tell her who the Americans are because you run into them by accident because everyone's going the same way.'", "description": "British student Elizabeth Beemer has shared the bizarre things she wished she knew about before she moved to Sydney, Australia  - including rude waiters, cockroaches and expensive food.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/02/19671544-0-image-a-31_1571014878297.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
