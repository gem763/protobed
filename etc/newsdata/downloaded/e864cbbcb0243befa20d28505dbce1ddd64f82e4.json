He has promised to boost the minimum wage and pensions, ditch fare hikes on public transportation and fix the country\u2019s ailing health care system.\n\nChile\u2019s unrest is the latest in a flare-up of protests in South America and around the world - from Beirut to Barcelona - each with local triggers but sharing in common anger at social disparities and ruling elites.\n\nThe riots prompted Pinera to declare \u201cwar\u201d on vandals and put the military in charge of security across much of the country. Santiago has been on lockdown every night this week, with strict curfews enforced by thousands of heavily armed soldiers on the streets.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nThe move sparked outrage among many in Chile, who said his words and actions harkened back to the grim era of military rule under dictator Augusto Pinochet.\n\nSpeaking with reporters Saturday morning, Pinera said he would lift the state of emergency Sunday evening at midnight \u201cif circumstances allow.\u201d\n\nChile\u00b4s military said Saturday the city \u201chad tended to normalcy...thanks to the contribution of all of its citizens,\u201d adding it would not enforce a curfew on Saturday evening.", "description": "Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Saturday he would shake up his cabinet to quell a week of mass protests against inequality that have rocked the South American nation.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445223820&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0GX", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
