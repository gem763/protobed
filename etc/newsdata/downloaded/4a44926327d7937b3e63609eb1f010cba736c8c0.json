Checkpoints have sprung up along major roads, and immigration officials have raided migrant shelters.\n\nThis week, L\u00f3pez Obrador declared the plan a success after Mexico apprehended around 108,500 migrants during the first half of 2019 \u2013 a 70% increase compared with the same period last year.\n\nMigration always drops off in the hot summer months, but US figures also showed a dramatic fall: in August, 50,693 migrants were apprehended at the US/Mexico border \u2013 an 88% drop from June\u2019s figure.\n\nMeanwhile in Guatemala, US federal authorities including Ice and intelligence agents are being deployed to dismantle smuggling networks, as part of the controversial \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement with the US.\n\nBut despite the clampdown, huge numbers of people continue to travel north \u2013 aided by Mexico\u2019s booming migration industry, a multi-faceted array of networks including coyotes, corrupt officials, crooks and concerned citizens.\n\nLocal aid workers estimate that 70% of migrants crossing the porous 871km Mexico-Guatemala border travel with coyotes \u2013 or \u201cguides\u201d as they prefer to be known \u2013 but the quality of service varies wildly.\n\nRosales prides himself on providing a safe passage, and says he sympathises with the migrants\u2019 plight: he previously lived as an undocumented migrant in Los Angeles, and along with his girlfriend was once kidnapped in Veracruz, trying to reach the US.\n\nHe works with a tightly knit group of associates, who move small groups of people by car and plane, providing \u2013 he claims \u2013 three decent meals a day. (Other coyotes guide larger groups and subcontract out dozens of short journeys to truck, bus and taxi drivers.)\n\nMexican kidnappers pile misery on to Central Americans fleeing violence Read more\n\nWith his latest clients, Rosales will accompany the Honduran family across the River Usumacinta in a small motorised boat, to Frontera Corozal in Chiapas, Mexico. He\u2019ll then drive them 300km to Villahermosa airport in the neighbouring state of Tabasco.\n\nMexican migration and security forces \u2013 including state and local police, the navy, army and national guard \u2013 patrol the highways which Rosales will drive, but the group will not be stopped. Rosales sends his contacts the travel schedule, and photos of the car and his clients, to guarantee a blind eye.\n\n\u201cEveryone gets paid, so I never have problems,\u201d said Rosales, who claims to spend 70% of what he earns on bribes. \u201cThe national guard are the same agents in different uniforms, still willing to make a deal.\u201d (An INM spokesperson said corruption was not tolerated and every allegation investigated.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A local taxi driver waits to transport migrants from the southern border to a safe house in Palenque.

Here, more associates will be waiting to guide them as they apply for asylum or cross the border illegally.\n\nRosales allowed that the current crackdown has reduced demand, forcing him to cut prices, but history shows that such declines rarely last. Last year\u2019s migrant caravans were also bad for business, until travellers stuck in Tijuana started contracting his team to take them through less congested border crossings.\n\nRosales lives a comfortable life in La T\u00e9cnica, which is thriving thanks to the money migrants spend on hotels, showers, food and transport. But not everyone is in it for the money.\n\n'May God bless you': evangelical pastors' hidden role in human smuggling's boom Read more\n\nFilomena Barrera, 67, a retired nurse and committed Catholic, has been providing safe haven for migrants since 2002. She offers free bed and board for the most desperate families, letting them sleep in her grown-up daughter\u2019s old room.\n\nBarrera, who constantly tremors because she cannot afford to treat her Parkinson\u2019s disease, has hosted countless migrants over the years. \u201cI look easygoing, but I am brave, and would do anything to save these poor people.\u201d\n\nAcross the river, the indigenous Chol community in Frontera Corozal is sustained by two groups of people: the tourists flocking to the nearby Mayan archaeological site Yaxchilan \u2013 and the migrants.\n\nAt around 11am, No\u00e9 Pino, 29, leans on his taxi waiting for migrants who often cross during peak tourist traffic to avoid detection. He picks up a Honduran man with a suitcase and drops him off at the junction with Highway 307 which heads north-west.\n\nAt the crossroad, groups of migrants come and go in taxis, combis and on foot. Pino \u2013 not his real name \u2013 points out a man as he gets out of a tourist minivan to buy a cold soda. \u2018He\u2019s a pollero [coyote]. He dropped off one group last night, now he\u2019s going back for the next,\u201d said Pino.\n\nPino knows that because he also worked last night, after receiving a call at 12.30am to pick up four migrants at the river and drop them in Palenque. It was a \u201ctypical night\u201d, according to Pino, with five taxis and eight minivans, each holding 15 passengers, subcontracted by smugglers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Central American migrants try to agree a price with a local taxi driver for the journey from Frontera Corozal to Palenque, Chiapas. Photograph: Encarni Pindado/Encarni Pindado for The Guardian\n\nPino says he doesn\u2019t fret about encountering migration or security agents because they\u2019re paid off in advance. But, the road north is plagued by armed bandits, and he narrowly survived a gun attack in 2015 which left him traumatized and off work for six months.\n\nEn route, Pino advises migrants to erase messages discussing the journey from their phones, but apart from that, he avoids conversation with clients.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get involved \u2013 I just do my job.\u201d\n\nAt the crossroads, a group of seven children and six adults from Honduras arrive in taxis from the river. They seem nervous and disorientated, unsure what to do next or who to ask for advice.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going, just that we\u2019re going,\u201d said a skinny 16-year-old, who asked not to be named.\n\nThe group mills about outside the general store in silence, until a toddler starts crying and tugs on his mother\u2019s sleeve, demanding his favourite toy car. As she digs inside a plastic bag full of their belongings, a navy patrol jeep parks across the road to question a man. It\u2019s the national guard, searching for migrants.", "description": "President Amlo says his new immigration plan is working, but huge numbers still travel north \u2013 aided by smugglers\u2019 bribes", "authors": ["Nina Lakhani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be871e1128cc3c54e2aba818b32e008dce425b1/0_154_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff1b5ff28e97477b8e79e6a758a4ce28", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
