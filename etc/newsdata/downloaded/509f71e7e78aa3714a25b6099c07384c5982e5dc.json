I haven't done it in a while and I've missed it.\"\n\nWoods made his final gain at the ninth where he barked for his ball to \"get down\" out of the rough.\n\n\"This grass, Zoysia, man. You can get some serious flyers out here, monster flyers,\" said Woods.\n\n\"The one I hit on the last hole, we were trying to hit an eight-iron 200 yards and hit it 200. That's not something I normally do.\"\n\nThe Zozo Championship offers a $9.75 million prize pot as the middle leg of the Tour's new near $30 million three-tournament Asian swing.\n\nIt began last week at the $9.75 million CJ Cup in South Korea, won by Justin Thomas who shot a level par 70 on Thursday, and concludes at next week's $10.25 million WGC-HSBC Champions in Shanghai.\n\nUnder threat of a tropical storm moving through the area from late morning, Friday's second round will start an hour earlier at 7am (2200 GMT Thursday) with the last three balls teeing off at 9am.", "description": "Tiger Woods got off to a horrific start before roaring back with nine birdies in 15 holes to share the inaugural Zozo Championship lead in Japan Thursday as Rory McIlroy struggled.
