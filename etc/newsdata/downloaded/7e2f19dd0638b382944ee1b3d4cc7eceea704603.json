If you want peace, love your nation.\u201d\n\nThen came an assertion so bold that it\u2019s hard to imagine any previous president uttering anything like it to such an assemblage of the self-important.\n\n\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists \u2014 the future belongs to patriots,\u201d the president told the 74th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit early for the president or anyone else to know to whom the future actually will belong. But not too early to know to whom it should belong.\n\nAt least it\u2019s not too early for people who want the ethnic-religious-racial cohesion that nationalism/patriotism promotes.\n\nOnce upon a time, most Democrats and plenty of liberals loved individualism and looked down on politically correct groupthink.\n\nSuch liberals cherished the uniqueness of every nation\u2019s culture and subcultures.\n\nLibs and Democratic presidential fantasizers now give such cultural uniqueness a cold shoulder at best or more often their most condescending sneer.\n\nThe Dems and libs sneered at Mr. Trump telling his U.N. audience this:\n\n\u201cThe future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\u201d\n\nThey sneered not because of what he said but because it was Donald Trump who said it. They\u2019ve labeled him a demagogue. No self-respecting demagogue means what he says. So it\u2019s OK to sneer at him and what he says.\n\nIf you\u2019re not following this sneer rationale, you\u2019re probably not a Democrat and certainly not a perfect model of a modern liberal.\n\nActually, the president\u2019s words stirred the hearts of regular people everywhere.\n\nWell, at least of regular people who fear that authoritarianism is inevitable any time you create a culturally pur\u00e9ed amalgam of what were independent nations.\n\nThe globalist wants you and the rest of the 7.7 billion people in the world to live in a fanciful, one-world, kumbaya utopia.\n\nConservatives and some classical liberals fear that globalist arcadia would, in reality, be a Big Brother, Newspeak, surveillance state.\n\nThe more nations that globalists are able to entice into their common culture with its common dictatorship, the harder it will be for democracy seekers to overthrow the dictatorship.\n\nIt\u2019s why 52 percent of the U.K. vote in 2016 went to citizens who want to leave the European Union.\n\nThe leavers can\u2019t abide by the bureaucrats in Brussels or the high court in Luxembourg telling the England, France, Italy, Spain, the Czech Republic, Poland and the rest what they can make and sell, how much they can tax, who can enter their respective countries at will and who\u2019s guilty of what.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s point is that there is built into the centralization of power an authoritarianism that the left either ignores or welcomes and that conservatives abhor.\n\n\u201cWise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first,\u201d he said in what should be the motto of the movement Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency represents in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nWe can only imagine how many of the foreign leaders whose chins remained motionless were nodding \u201cyes\u201d in their hearts to Mr. Trump\u2019s exegesis on nationalism.\n\n\u201cLike my beloved country, each nation represented in this hall has a cherished history, culture and heritage that is worth defending and celebrating, and which gives us our singular potential and strength,\u201d he said. \u201cThe free world must embrace its national foundations. It must not attempt to erase them or replace them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s divinely perfect, figuratively speaking, that he delivered this exceptional speech to a body that aspires to global governance.\n\nFifty-one nations founded the U.N. just after World War II. They included Iran (not remotely resembling today\u2019s iteration) and the Republic of China (now a province of the People\u2019s Republic of China).\n\nThey wrestled with concerns about nationalism\u2019s perceived warlike hegemonic tendencies. They came up with a global confederacy of unintentional dystopians.\n\nImagine, an American president telling a gathering of the U.N. that it\u2019s actually a good thing for any nation\u2019s people and leaders to strive to uphold their national interest.\n\nMr. Trump did that and added that globalism had \u201cexerted a religious pull over past leaders causing them to ignore their own national interests.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t say it, but that religious pull was like the one that caused free-market purists to ignore generational damage that unfair trade did to American workers.\n\nAmerica\u2019s politicians and intentional corporate chieftains inflicted the damage by their self-serving insistence that free trade is the same thing as fair trade, no matter how unfair it is to real people in the country.\n\n\u201cBut as far as America is concerned,\u201d Mr. Trump told the U.N., \u201cthose days are over.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the rhetorical clenched-fist firmness so many Americans have waited so long to hear from a president.\n\nInternationalists think nationalism makes inevitable adversarial collisions with other nations. Too often true, but not inevitably.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of evidence to the contrary and to which globalists are intentionally blind. And Mr. Trump does not shrink from prying open their eyes on the subject.\n\n\u201cMany of America\u2019s greatest friends today were once its greatest foes,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe want partners, not adversaries. \u2026 America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump didn\u2019t say it in his U.N. speech, but the Declaration of Independence itself is a call to civic nationalism. As Abraham Lincoln said before becoming president, the Declaration unites people of different ethnic heritages in the incredibly diverse USA.\n\nCiting the lines \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,\u201d Mr. Lincoln said what Mr. Trump knows:\n\n\u201cThat is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together \u2014 that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
