A representative of Las Vegas Sands Corp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nU.S.-China trade tensions have led to tariffs on much of the commerce between the world's two biggest economies, hitting U.S. factories and farms.\n\nWhile the U.S. economy has looked otherwise strong in recent months, a downturn might weigh on Trump's hopes of winning the November 2020 election.\n\nWashington and Beijing are in talks to restructure their trade relations, although a deal has appeared elusive. On Friday, Chinese officials unexpectedly canceled a visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska as deputy trade negotiators wrapped up two days of negotiations in Washington.", "description": "Republican casino magnate Adelson cautioned Trump on trade war with China: WSJ", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8L0UD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
