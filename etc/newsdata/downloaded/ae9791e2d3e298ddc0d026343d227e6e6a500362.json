She\u2019s yet to encounter Letson (5-1 MMA, 1-0 UFC), though, who is coming off an octagon win in the weight class and is therefor a logical foe for Anderson.", "description": "See whom Israel Adesanya should fight next after claiming the middleweight title from Robert Whittaker at UFC 243.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan", "Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Ken Hathaway", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sss-israel-adesanya.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
