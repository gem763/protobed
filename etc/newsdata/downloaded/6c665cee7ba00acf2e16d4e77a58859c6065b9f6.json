Patriots (1): If they had to face an AFC all-star team for conference title, how much would these guys be favored by? Let's set the opening line at less than 32\u00bd.\n\n2. Saints (2): New Orleans could be on cusp of fascinating dilemma as contracts of both Drew Brees and Teddy Bridgewater scheduled to void in 2020.\n\n3. Packers (3): Aaron Rodgers' .800 winning percentage, 114.1 QB rating vs. AFC West his best marks against any division. Next up? Chiefs and Chargers.\n\n4. 49ers (4): Much has been made of New England's historic defensive start, yet Niners boasted league's top-ranked unit following Sunday's action.\n\n5. Vikings (7): Torrid Kirk Cousins is primed to show Washington what a catastrophic mistake it made by letting him go ... assuming Case Keenum and Adrian Peterson don't have bigger axes to grind at Minnesota.\n\n32 things we learned: From Week 7 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nWeek 7 winners, losers: Aaron Rodgers now in MVP race; Mitchell Trubisky looks lost\n\nMike Jones: Jacoby Brissett proves he's the long-term answer for Colts\n\n6. Ravens (16): Didn't take long for shrewd Marcus Peters trade to pay off. We'll find out in Week 9 if Baltimore has built a defense that can combat Patriots.\n\n7. Colts (15): Their next four opponents are a collective 7-19 leading up to rematch with Texans in Houston. Indy could have AFC South in a stranglehold by then.\n\n8. Panthers (12): They're sticking with Kyle Allen (for now) \u2014 though if he manages to hand Niners first loss, Cam Newton may never get his job back.\n\n9. Texans (5): They're consistently shedding draft picks (now a third rounder for Gareon Conley) even as product on field remains consistently inconsistent.\n\n10. Chiefs (6): Welp ... it appears season is in hands of a pair of Miami castoffs (Matt Moore and, soon, Chad Henne) and Vandy's undrafted Kyle Shurmur.\n\n11. Bills (9): Struggle to beat winless Dolphins only feeds narrative that Buffalo's 5-1 record is built on lineup of tomato cans.\n\n12. Seahawks (8): Failed to take ball away for first time this season in Sunday's loss to Baltimore. Sure would've helped to have Earl Thomas on their side.\n\n13. Rams (18): Get-right game at Atlanta may be first of many as NFC champs don't face team with winning record until Ravens visit L.A. in Week 12.\n\n14. Lions (10): Trey Flowers was understandably frustrated in Week 6 \u2014 but maybe he should also be frustrated by his disappointing production (1 sack, 3 QB hits) so far.\n\n15. Cowboys (19): They broke losing streak by forcing four turnovers for first time in nearly two years, but bye comes at opportune time for battered 'Boys.\n\n16. Raiders (13): Guessing they won't be afraid to go after CB Gareon Conley, former first rounder they just traded to Texans, in Houston this Sunday.\n\n17. Eagles (11): They've been outscored 75-30 after two games of what's shaping up as disastrous three-week road trip. Matters won't get easier in Buffalo.\n\n18. Bears (14): Recent struggles of defense, ongoing struggles of Mitch Trubisky could be alleviated if running backs could manage more than 3 yards a carry.\n\n19. Steelers (20): Coming out of bye, still time for them to get back into muddled AFC race with next three games at Heinz Field and Mason Rudolph on mend.\n\n20. Jaguars (21): Despite losing starting QB in Week 1, then getting strongarmed into trading their top player, they're only one back of Colts in win column.\n\n21. Buccaneers (17): TE O.J. Howard has never had more than 35 catches in a season, but, per multiple reports, Bucs just can't bear to trade him. Why?\n\n22. Broncos (23): Since winning Super Bowl 50, they've employed three coaches and a dozen or so QBs ... but only one GM. Just sayin' ... common denominator.\n\n23. Titans (28): Backup QB Ryan Tannehill stepped in, won and threw for 312 yards \u2014 a total Marcus Mariota hasn't surpassed in his last 17 starts.\n\n24. Chargers (24): Last year, they didn't lose in regular season when Melvin Gordon was sidelined. This year, they haven't won with him on field.\n\n25. Browns (22): The last time they won in Foxborough was 1992, and \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Cleveland's head coach was Bill Belichick. Good luck Sunday, fellas.\n\n26. Cardinals (26): CB Patrick Peterson finally returns, and Arizona picks off its first pass of 2019 (courtesy LB Jordan Hicks). Funny how that works.\n\n27. Giants (25): Now Pat Shurmur is fielding questions about possibly benching rookie QB Daniel Jones. Never change, New York media.\n\n28. Jets (27): So that's the kind of game that can irreparably shatter a young quarterback's confidence. Here's hoping New England doesn't force Sam Darnold to kiss his promising career goodbye. #MonoJokes\n\n29. Falcons (29): With Seahawks, Saints and Panthers next teams looming on schedule, starting to seem more humane to euthanize Dan Quinn's tenure now.\n\n30. Redskins (30): How is poor Montez Sweat supposed to effectively market Old Spice \u2014 brilliant choice of pitchman btw \u2014 if he's playing in a deluge?\n\n31. Bengals (31): With A.J. Green now in his walk year, why wouldn't Cincinnati try to move its most marketable asset in what's already a lost season?\n\n32. Dolphins (32): They'll get to \"perform\" in front of a national TV audience next week \u2014 if only Monday night games were subject to the flex policy.\n\n(Previous ranking in parentheses)\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "description": "The top four teams in our weekly poll are unchanged, but the surging Vikings managed to join them near top.
