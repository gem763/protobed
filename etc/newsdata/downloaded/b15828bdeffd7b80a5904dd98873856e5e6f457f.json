Has any single one of those people been out to the Outback, where children, babies, five-year-olds are being raped? Their mothers are being raped, their sisters are being raped. They get no education. What have you done?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe panel was momentarily silent \u2014 until Stynes spoke up.\n\n\u201cThat is not even faintly true, Kerri-Anne. You\u2019re sounding quite racist right now.\u201d\n\nStynes\u2019 statement was met with gasps from the studio audience \u2014 and Kennerley herself said she was \u201coffended\u201d by the assertion.\n\n\u201cWell keep going then, because every time you open your mouth you\u2019re sounding racist,\u201d said Stynes.\n\n\u201cI am seriously offended by that, Yumi. SERIOUSLY offended,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\n\u201cThese people are desperate for help. Aboriginal elder women are desperate for help, and they\u2019re not getting it. Where are these people (other than) one day of the year? You\u2019d be better off doing something positive,\u201d Kennerley continued.\n\nAt that point Studio 10 host Sarah Harris attempted to play peacemaker, imploring her co-stars to \u201ctake it back a notch \u2026 everything\u2019s going to be cool.\u201d\n\nBut they weren\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cJust because I have a point of view, Yumi, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re actually connecting rape, child abuse, you\u2019re drawing a straight line \u2026 and you\u2019re implying those 5000 protesters, none of whom you know personally, are all lazy and idle. You\u2019re asking if any of them have ever done anything as though it\u2019s clear they haven\u2019t,\u201d said Stynes.\n\nKennerley chided her for \u201cdrawing a line that isn\u2019t there\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the line! I see it quite clearly,\u201d said Stynes.\n\n\u201cWell \u2026 get new glasses,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\nHarris again tried to rein in the debate, asking the pair to refrain from name-calling. Kennerley insisted it had been a friendly disagreement.\n\n\u201cThis is just an issue that Yumi and I have. There are probably 20 other things that we do agree on \u2014 this is just one that we don\u2019t,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\nThe steely glances between the pair suggested they might be hard pressed to find 20 other things they agree on.\n\nAs the episode ended, Harris addressed the earlier \u201cfiery\u201d conflict, saying they \u201cmake no apologies for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYumi and I had a difference of opinion, but that\u2019s called a mature society where you can have different opinions without name-calling. It\u2019s called TOLERANCE,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\nHarris and Joe Hildebrand both repeatedly stressed that they were \u201call friends\u201d, before Kennerley called on Stynes, who had remained silent.\n\n\u201cYumi, I\u2019m looking for a comment back here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you did say name-calling \u2026\u201d said Stynes.\n\n\u201cYou called me a racist,\u201d said Kennerley.\n\n\u201cAnd you are implying that I did the wrong thing by saying that to you,\u201d Stynes continued \u2014 promising they would continue the debate in the next episode, and even offering Kennerley a sarcastic-sounding \u201clove you\u201d through gritted teeth.\n\n@James_P_Hall | james.hall1@news.com.au", "description": "Channel 10 has been cleared by the industry watchdog following an investigation into Kerri-Anne Kennerley\u2019s explosive debate earlier this year when she was branded a racist.", "authors": ["James Hall"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/2e225c1ab0b740cb311674371f25475b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
