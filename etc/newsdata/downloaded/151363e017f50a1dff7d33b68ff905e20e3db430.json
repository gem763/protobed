Critically, neither had enough support from lawmakers in the 120-seat Knesset to form a majority coalition.\n\nNegotiators representing the two leaders met on Tuesday to hash out what a government composed of the two parties might look like, and Netanyahu and Gantz were due to meet on Wednesday evening.\n\nThere was, however, little optimism they could forge a deal, as both men have demanded the top seat. Gantz, whose election campaign focused on ending the prime minister\u2019s 13-year rule, has also repeatedly pledged not to serve with Netanyahu while he faces three potential indictments for corruption.\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin is required by law to choose a candidate within a week, although amid the deadlock he has pressed for the bickering politicians to join forces instead.\n\nThere is a precedent in Israel for political rivals to serve together after Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres rotated the role of prime minister in the mid-1980s, each agreeing to serve two years.\n\nIf they do reach an agreement, Netanyahu would be under added pressure to serve first. Prime ministers are not required to step down if indicted for corruption and his pre-trial hearing is set for early October. He has denied all allegations.\n\nRivlin faces a tough challenge but has attempted to show progress. His office released a photograph of the three men clasping hands at a Monday meeting. \u201cThe responsibility for establishing a government falls on you, and the people expect you to find a solution,\u201d Rivlin told Netanyahu and Gantz.\n\nIsraeli media reported that negotiations have focused on policy issues to build confidence, rather than solely the big questions of who leads and who gets which ministerial post.\n\nGantz told his followers on Tuesday evening that Blue and White had gone into negotiations \u201cwith an open mind and heart\u201d. But he added: \u201cThat said, it is important that everyone understands that we will not relinquish our principles or our partners.\u201d\n\nQuick guide The police investigations swirling around Netanyahu Show Hide The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance. Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nFurther complicating talks, Netanyahu struck an agreement with rightwing and religious parties that back him to make sure they are part of any future government.\n\nSticking to the bloc could stonewall negotiations as Gantz has promised to run only in a secular government. His Blue and White party wants civil marriage and to open shops on the sabbath, a holy day of rest. These issues could be deal-breakers for religious politicians.\n\nIf negotiations break down, the president can choose either candidate, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin can ask a second person.\n\nThat scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition after a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.\n\nMany fear a third election will be called if the stalemate continues.", "description": "President Rivlin required by law to choose a prime minister by next Wednesday", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Raja Shehadeh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/099a2c0923573ee577394669c4b1d8f23c3b68aa/0_167_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94fa9ec934c0c4b25e998f1577c87ac1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
