Homicide does.\u201d\n\nThere were also haemorrhages in Epstein\u2019s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon in suicidal hangings, he added.\n\nDr Baden, a Fox News contributor, claimed there were signs of \u201cunusual\u201d activity \u201cfrom day one\u201d of the autopsy.\n\nNew York's medical examiner has not yet responded to his claims.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe called for a fresh investigation into Epstein's death, saying a number of people would have to be involved if it was a homicide.\n\nEvidence on the ligature could help to prove whether someone was involved in Epstein's death.\n\nThe expert also cited a \u201ctotal breakdown in security\u201d around Epstein's cell and rejected claims that the guards had fallen asleep as two CCTV cameras malfunctioned.\n\nDr Baden said his own investigation is not complete.\n\nHe has examined more than 20,000 bodies during his career and hosted the HBO programme Autopsy.\n\nJust weeks before his death, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck in what was thought to be a possible suicide attempt at the time.\n\nHe was put on suicide watch but removed a week later.\n\nHe was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death.", "description": "Jeffrey Epstein's death was ruled a suicide but pathologist Dr Michael Baden, who has probed cases involving OJ Simpson and John F Kennedy, has suggested he could have been strangled", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18806253.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/6_Jeffrey-Epstein5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
