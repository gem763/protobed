He was blind and had weeks to live.\n\nTo Diana, the picture represented everything about how she wished to be seen: compassionate and ready to break down the barriers of protocol.\n\nSince her death, that baton of royal informality and spontaneity has been picked up by her sons, most notably by Prince Harry in Africa last month.\n\nInevitably, William's progress this week will be monitored especially to see if it is he, rather than his brother, who has the stronger claim to Diana's legacy. William is pictured above with Kate last week\n\nNow it is William's turn as he and Kate arrive in Pakistan today, the country that in the last year of her life Diana was more closely identified with than any other.\n\nIt will be the first time a member of the Royal Family has set foot there for 13 years because violence and terrorism had made it dangerous and unstable.\n\nInevitably, their five-day visit will bring back memories of the visits made by the Prince's mother.\n\nIn all, Diana visited three times, once when still married to Prince Charles and twice more after her separation when she was deeply in love with the Pakistan-born heart surgeon Hasnat Khan.\n\nAt the time, she was considering marriage to him and even moving to his homeland.\n\nDuring her trips, she managed to slip away privately to meet his family. There will be no such cloak-and-dagger antics for Prince William, of course.\n\nIt is far more likely that he and Kate will follow the template of Diana's 1991 tour, her first solo visit representing the Queen to a Commonwealth country.\n\nIt was widely expected to be a failure. Indeed, there were some in her then- husband's camp who were actively hoping it would be.\n\nAs one of her key aides from the tour recalls: 'I knew that many of them expected/wanted us to f*** it up and we didn't. The opening line of the High Commissioner's post-trip telegram was, 'The Princess of Wales took Pakistan by storm.' And she did.'\n\nAmong the first people he will meet is Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, the former heart-throb cricketer turned politician. It was Khan, then the husband of Diana's friend Jemima Goldsmith, who hosted Diana's visits to Pakistan in 1996 and 1997\n\nA chance meeting in the royal box at Wimbledon between the Princess and Pakistan's then prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 1989 led to the invitation.\n\nBut a military coup the following year, in which Bhutto was overthrown, delayed the trip for two years.\n\nDiana was determined to go. 'I'd had five vaccinations for typhoid, polio, tetanus, cholera and hepatitis A \u2014 I couldn't not go!' she said.\n\nAides crafted a programme to reinforce her mainstream royal credentials, although speculation about the state of her marriage was growing, culminating in a blizzard of headlines when it was revealed that Diana would spend her 30th birthday apart from Prince Charles.\n\nSo the tour was built around traditional royal elements \u2014 laying a wreath at Commonwealth war graves and formal cultural and ceremonial events.\n\nDiana's visit to the country's holiest shrine, the Mughal mosque of Badshawi in Lahore, for example, where she was photographed barefoot, is almost certainly to be on William and Kate's itinerary.\n\nBut amid the formality aides included engagements aligned to her charitable interests.\n\nShe went to a drug detoxification unit and flew to Peshawar to visit a centre for disabled Afghan refugees established by the veteran ITN newsreader Sandy Gall where, for the first time, she learned about the indiscriminate horror of landmines.\n\nSince her death, that baton of royal informality and spontaneity has been picked up by her sons, most notably by Prince Harry in Africa last month. Now it is William's turn as he and Kate arrive in Pakistan today\n\nNor did she hold back from using her position to gently admonish Pakistan's notoriously male-dominated hierarchy.\n\nIn a speech on health, education, drugs and population control, she teased: 'These might be areas in which women can make a special contribution.'\n\nShe had already broken with some traditions by shaking hands with male officials on her arrival.\n\nIt was reported that they had been dazzled by her outfit, a calf-length silk dress in green and white, Pakistan's national colours.\n\nPlanners ensured that her programme contained nothing indulgent, nothing frivolous, nothing experimental and no animal charities.\n\n(As she once told her private secretary Patrick Jephson: 'We'll do animal charities when we run out of people charities.')\n\nEverywhere she went, she was mobbed by well-wishers.\n\nInevitably, William's progress this week will be monitored especially to see if it is he, rather than his brother, who has the stronger claim to Diana's legacy.\n\nEver since his gap-year trip to Lesotho in 2004 where he established his charity, Sentebale, Harry has staked out his mother's territory as his own.\n\nHis trip with Meghan to South Africa last month was, at first, an impressive example of royal 'soft diplomacy' (at least until he detonated his attack on the Press).\n\nWilliam, too, has been adopting issues close to Diana's memory.\n\nHe has spoken out on LGBT rights, a new development for the royals just as Aids was for Diana in the Eighties, and like her he is also a regular visitor to the Royal Marsden, the cancer hospital, in London.\n\nHe, too, mixes hugs for nursing staff with bedside chats for patients. For William, the echoes of his mother will be all around.\n\nAmong the first people he will meet is Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, the former heart-throb cricketer turned politician.\n\nIt was Khan, then the husband of Diana's friend Jemima Goldsmith, who hosted Diana's visits to Pakistan in 1996 and 1997, by which time she was divorced and had been shorn of her HRH title.\n\nAnd it was at the cancer hospital that Imran built in his late mother's name that Diana had nursed that blind little boy.\n\nDiana's visit to the country's holiest shrine, the Mughal mosque of Badshawi in Lahore, for example, where she was photographed barefoot, is almost certainly to be on William and Kate's itinerary\n\nThere is another intriguing link: Prime Minister Khan is a cousin \u2014 albeit a distant one \u2014 of Dr Hasnat Khan and he offered to be a go-between with the doctor for Diana.\n\nDiana was fascinated by Jemima's life and how she had adapted to Pakistani culture.\n\nCould she, too, adjust? She travelled to Pakistan with hope that she would win the approval of her beau's family.\n\nWhen Dr Khan became close to Diana, it is easy to understand the excitement this social triumph generated among the Khan family back home.\n\nFamily members spoke of the two enjoying an 'Eastern love affair, not a Western one'. It was pure and chaste, they said.\n\n(Years later, in a statement to police investigating her death, Hasnat Khan said that he and Diana had a normal sexual relationship.)\n\nIn February 1996, she flew to Pakistan with Lady Annabel Goldsmith, Jemima's mother, in a private jet. This time her welcome was not quite so warm.\n\nIt was not long after her explosive BBC TV Panorama interview and one commentator was scathing.\n\n'She is seen as a person in a troubled marriage on the verge of divorce who openly admits to adultery on television. It might be acceptable in Britain but she is not a good role model in Pakistan,' he said.\n\nIt was after her third visit to the country, in May 1997, that she decided life in Pakistan was too volatile, too unpredictable.\n\nHer relationship with the heart surgeon ended abruptly and, six weeks later, Diana was dead.\n\nHasnat Khan, one of the few people drawn into the whirlwind of Diana's life to emerge with any credit, continues to devote himself to his work both in Britain and in Pakistan where, like Imran Khan, he has established his own hospital.\n\nFor William and Kate, meanwhile, this week will be a chance to write a new chapter in royal relations with Pakistan.\n\n'It's not about laying ghosts,' says a friend. '[William] is proud of what his mother achieved and he is proud to be following in her footsteps.'", "description": "RICHARD KAY: Inevitably, William's progress this week will be monitored especially to see if it is he, rather than his brother, who has the stronger claim to Diana's legacy.", "authors": ["Richard Kay For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/22/19666422-0-image-a-27_1571000714689.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
