Japanese distillers like Suntory, which makes the Hibiki and Yamazaki brands, didn\u2019t have enough stock to meet a tsunami of demand, and supplies dried up. High-end whiskies have to mature in barrels for several years before being bottled and sold.\n\nThe upshot has been a scramble to secure\u2014and ration\u2014even some of the more numerous bottles of Japanese whisky.\n\nRaymundo Delgado, lead bartender at Japanese restaurant PABU in San Francisco, describes the quest for each bottle as a journey. PABU is part of a restaurant group that sells over $40 million of alcoholic drinks a year, giving it leverage in negotiations with suppliers. \u201cI still have to sit down for 30 minutes to get one high-end product,\u201d Mr. Delgado says.\n\nA very rare 50-year-old bottle of Suntory\u2019s Yamazaki whisky is displayed in a 2018 auction in Hong Kong.

He often plans the week\u2019s cocktail list based on the cases of alcohol he purchases to get Japanese whisky.\n\nOften, it\u2019s worth it. Mr. Delgado recently got his hands on a rare 27-year-old bottle of Mars Komagatake, which he sells at $529 for a 2-ounce shot. The sticker shock is little deterrent for some customers. \u201cPeople get promoted, they get to be partners, they want to celebrate,\u201d he said. \u201cThese bottles fly out the window.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always hard, or expensive, to get a good bottle of Japanese whisky. Whisky dealer David Wainwright remembers telling a customer in 1990s London that a batch of old Japanese whiskies the customer was trying to off-load had no commercial value after he failed to find a buyer for the lot at around $100 at current exchange rates.\n\nIts value today: over $4,000.\n\nLuxury sales have reached head-spinning levels: A 50-year-old bottle of Yamazaki sold for nearly $430,000 in January at a Taipei auction and a set of 54 Hanyu bottles, each labeled with the design of a different playing card, recently sold for about $917,000 at a Hong Kong auction. Industry insiders say private sales can reach $1 million.\n\nA limited-edition set of Hanyu whisky bottles, each labeled with the design of a different playing card.

The bar\u2019s owner has located a new bottle and is negotiating with the seller over price says general manager Masahiko Endo, but the market for rare whisky is so sensitive that he wouldn\u2019t say where the seller is or the range of prices being discussed.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How much would you be willing to pay for your favorite beverage? Join the conversation below.\n\nA single measure from the bar\u2019s remaining bottle goes for around $460, but for now, staff keep it hidden on the second row of the display to ensure they don\u2019t run out.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, it\u2019s almost impossible to find\u201d the best bottles, says Mr. Endo, who is from Fukuoka in western Japan.\n\nJapanese whisky isn\u2019t unique for its scarcity and high prices, but unlike other hot brands such as Pappy Van Winkle, the notoriously hard-to-get bourbon, the widespread absence of Japanese whisky from the market isn\u2019t deliberately manufactured. Rather, Japanese whisky makers didn\u2019t foresee the rapid increase in demand for their products in the early 2010s in time to start producing more.\n\nLast year, Suntory said it would discontinue sales of two of its most popular whiskies because of dwindling supplies, including 17-year-old Hibiki, which appeared in a mock television commercial featuring an aging actor played by Bill Murray in the 2003 movie \u201cLost in Translation.\u201d Suntory spokeswoman Hasumi Ozawa said the company had raised production of whisky but the long maturation process means it is hard to determine when supplies will be able to meet demand. Suntory has invested over $300 million to boost whisky production since 2013, she said.\n\nSuntory staff occasionally joke they aren\u2019t allowed to drink their own whisky to preserve supplies.\n\nMeantime, price inflation has pushed some drinkers to explore other options. At Butler, another Hong Kong whisky bar, a shot of 12-year-old Yamazaki goes for around $30. Bartender Yuta Inagaki says that\u2019s how much a whole bottle of the spirit\u2014his favorite drink\u2014cost when he left Japan for Hong Kong in 2014. He cites a mention by Beyonc\u00e9 of Yamazaki whisky in a 2016 song as a symbol of the drink\u2019s transition to a luxury item.\n\nCopper & Oak, a bar in New York with a large selection of Japanese whiskies.
