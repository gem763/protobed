The area needs to be free of both Kurdish militants and Islamic State fighters, he said.\n\nErdogan will meet Pence and Pompeo during their visit to Ankara.\n\nRussia Says It Respects Turkey\u2019s Right to Ensure Security (1:10 p.m.)\n\nRussia said Turkey has a right to ensure its own security but its military operation must not undermine efforts to end the Syrian civil war.\n\n\u201dWe respect Turkey\u2019s right to take measures to ensure its own security, but we expect that the operation will be proportional to this expediency -- to ensure security and the tasks of ensuring security,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call Wednesday. While it\u2019s hard to say how long the operation may go on, Russia hopes it won\u2019t \u201charm the process of political settlement\u201d of the Syrian conflict, he said.\n\nTurkish Markets Cave Under U.S. Pressure as Banks Hit Over Syria (11:40 a.m.)\n\nA renewed sell-off gripped Turkish markets after the U.S. brought criminal charges against one of the nation\u2019s largest banks, in what could be an escalation of Washington\u2019s efforts to reprimand Ankara for its military incursion into northeast Syria.\n\nStocks fell with government bonds and shares of Turkey\u2019s state-run Halkbank slumped as much as 7.4%, the most since March. The lira bucked the rout as state banks were seen selling dollars to support the currency, according to three traders with knowledge of the matter.\n\nTurkish Markets Cave Under U.S. Pressure as Banks Hit Over Syria\n\nHalkbank Says U.S. Case Linked to Turkey\u2019s Syria Operation (11:31 a.m.)\n\nThe U.S. indictment was filed as part of the sanctions introduced against the military operation in Syria and appears largely to repeat allegations made during the trial of former Halkbank executive Hakan Atilla, the Turkish state lender said in a public filing.\n\n\u201cThe bank was not engaged in any secondary U.S. sanctions violations,\u201d the bank said. Halkbank said it doesn\u2019t have any branches or employees based in the U.S. and falls outside the Department of Justice\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAssad, Kurdish-led Forces Clash with Turkey-Backed Troops (11:30 a.m.)\n\nKurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and troops loyal to Assad clashed overnight with Turkish-backed fighters east of the Syrian border town of Ain Issa, according to Rami Abdurrahman, head of the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war through activists on the ground.\n\nThe clashes came after Turkish-backed forces struck a Syrian government base in Ain Issa, killing two soldiers.\n\nTurkey Rejects Demand for Syria Cease-Fire, Draws Line at Kobani (07:08 a.m.)\n\nPresident Erdogan rejected the Trump administration\u2019s demand for a cease-fire in Syria, but signaled he was willing to compromise over the fate of two strategic border towns he wants removed from Kurdish control.\n\nErdogan said he\u2019d told Trump that Turkey has no plans to target Kobani, which U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters liberated from Islamic State in a months-long battle. He also said Turkey did not view too negatively Assad\u2019s takeover of the town of Manbij.\n\n\u201cTrump asked us not to hit Kobani,\u201d Erdogan said in comments published on the presidency\u2019s website late Tuesday. \u201cWe have a containment operation around the city. We are not seriously interested in the inner side of the city. But depending on developments, we may intervene.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s Halkbank Faces U.S. Charges as Tensions Mount (01:03 a.m.)\n\nThe U.S. brought a criminal case against one of Turkey\u2019s largest banks for aiding a scheme to evade sanctions against Iran, a move that carries political overtones as tensions build over Turkey\u2019s military incursions in Syria.\n\nIn an indictment filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors accused government-owned Halkbank of participating in a wide-ranging plot to violate prohibitions on Iran\u2019s access to the U.S. financial system. The conspiracy involved high-ranking government officials in Iran and Turkey, the U.S. said.\n\n\u201cHalkbank\u2019s systemic participation in the illicit movement of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Iranian oil revenue was designed and executed by senior bank officials,\u201d U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in New York said in a statement. \u201cHalkbank will now have to answer for its conduct in an American court.\u201d", "description": "UN Security Council Expresses Concern Over ISIS: Syria Update", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/World_News_9_800x533_L_1420026261.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
