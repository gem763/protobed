The government is due to outline a plan for future generation later on Friday.\n\nEskom said up to 2,000 megawatts (MW) of power would be cut from the grid -- more than the 1,000 MW Acting Chief Executive Jabu Mabuza had indicated on Thursday, when he also said he did not expect further power cuts through the weekend.\n\n\"Since the media briefing last night, we have had a major setback as we have lost additional capacity from Medupi power station,\" Eskom said in a statement.\n\n\"This means that the power system has deteriorated further creating an additional shortage of generation capacity of about 1,500 MW.\"\n\nIt said it would cut 1,000 megawatts (MW) of power from 0700 GMT until 1000 GMT on Friday on a rotational basis across the country. Thereafter, 2,000 MW would be cut until 2100 GMT.\n\nEskom said Medupi units 3, 4 and 5 had gone offline late on Thursday due to coal and ash handling issues which it did not explain further, compounding difficulties caused by the failure of a conveyer belt at the power station on Saturday.\n\nThe power cuts highlight the challenge President Cyril Ramaphosa faces in rescuing Eskom, which has been beset for years by financial and technical problems.\n\nDebilitating power cuts in February and March pushed first-quarter economic growth into contraction and raised the likelihood of South Africa, the continent's most industrialised economy, losing its last investment-grade rating.\n\nSouth Africa's Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe will brief media on Friday on the country's long-delayed plan for electricity generation.\n\nThe Integrated Resource Plan will replace a previous blueprint not updated for almost a decade, and deals with planned electricity generation and energy mix.\n\nSouth Africa's cabinet approved the promulgation of the plan on Thursday.
