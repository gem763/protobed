(Lucy Nicholson/Reuters )\n\nMaking the click-through worthwhile: LeBron James chooses to stand with China; the U.S. examines its options for leverage with Turkey; and Hunter Biden admits something obvious about his past employers.\n\nLeBron James and Donald Trump Finally Agree on Something: Abandoning Hong Kong\n\n\u201cYes, we do have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d \u2014 LeBron James.\n\nLeBron James announced that, like everyone else in the NBA, he finds the imprisonment of one to two million Uighurs in concentration camps and increasingly violent crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong simply too complicated and nuanced to comment upon.\n\n\u201cI think when we talk about the political side, I think it\u2019s a very delicate situation. A very sensitive situation. And I think for me personally, for any of you guys who know me or always cover me, you know that when I speak about something, I speak about something I\u2019m very knowledgeable about. Something that hits home for me. Something I\u2019m very passionate about, and I felt like with this particular situation it was something that not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that not only myself of my teammates or the organization had enough information to talk about it at that point in time. And we still feel the same way.\u201d\n\nBut the situation isn\u2019t so complicated that James doesn\u2019t feel comfortable criticizing the one guy who dared tweet, \u201cStand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s another situation that should stay behind closed doors. I think when we all sit back and learn from the situation that happened, understand that what you could tweet or could say . . . We all talk about this freedom of speech. Yes, we all do have freedom of speech, but at times there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others, and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself. I don\u2019t want to get into a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and what we say, and what we do. Even though yes, we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d\n\nLest you think this was an isolated slip of the tongue:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just my belief. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s my belief. That\u2019s all I can say. I believe he was either misinformed or not really educated on the situation. And if he was, then so be it, but I have no idea. That\u2019s just my belief that when you say things or do things, and you know the people that can be affected by it, and the families an the individuals and everyone that can be affected by it, sometimes things can be changed. And also sometimes social media is not always the proper way to go about things as well. But that\u2019s just my belief.\u201d\n\nSee, if Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey just had a little more \u201ceducation,\u201d he would see the other side of the story about concentration camps and brutal police crackdowns. It\u2019s complicated. On one side, you have the people who don\u2019t want to be put in the concentration camps, and on the other side, you have the people running the concentration camps. On one side, you\u2019ve got the cops in Hong Kong, and on the other side, you\u2019ve got the people being beaten and shot. Who among us can say who\u2019s right, you know?\n\nJames also tweeted, \u201cMy team and this league just went through a difficult week. I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it . . . Let me clear up the confusion. I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I\u2019m not discussing the substance. Others can talk About that.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but my heart just breaks about all the difficulty that some of the world\u2019s most highly paid and well-treated athletes on the Golden State Warriors and throughout the NBA have been through this week. I\u2019m sure that James and his teammates have been through almost as rough a week as the Uighurs or Hong Kong protesters.\n\nAnd no, our president is no better and is in fact even more shameful, considering the traditional role of the President of the United States in standing up for American values. No one\u2019s asking the president to nuke Beijing or deploy troops to Hong Kong. Just stand up for what\u2019s right and denounce the abuse of innocent people, instead of insisting that a new trade deal will resolve the situation.\n\nIn case you missed it, our president shrugged and declared, \u201cI think great progress has been made by China in Hong Kong. I\u2019ve been watching, and I actually told the vice premier, it really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a couple of months ago, when I saw a lot of people and I see far fewer now.\u201d [Note: Tens of thousands of protesters gathered in central Hong Kong Monday night.] \u201cWe were discussing it, and I think that\u2019s going to take care of itself. I think this [U.S.-China trade] deal is a great deal for the people of Hong Kong to see what happened. I think this is a very positive thing for Hong Kong. But it really has \u2014 the escalation, it really has de-escalated a lot, and we were discussing it.\u201d\n\nLest you think that the situation is calming down, Chinese president Xi Jinping said Sunday in Nepal that. any attempt \u201cto split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones.\u201d\n\nAs Melissa Chan observes, \u201cBetween LeBron and Kerr you\u2019ve got some pretty well-known social justice sports guys whose social justice begins in America but ends at Communist China\u2019s doorstep. Or put another way \u2014 willing to give Americans a hard time but not any Chinese.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrecisely. Both LeBron and Kerr specifically are outspoken about disrespecting the rights of minorities, about police abuses, and about a government abusing its power and authority here in the United States. But when faced with the same issues, in a conflict where one side is effectively paying the NBA enough, these guys suddenly go silent.\n\nOn paper, any entity in America that was wealthy enough could purchase the silence of NBA superstars. NBA revenue from China is estimated at $500 million annually, although it could be higher. If the National Organization of Police Organizations thinks NBA players have unfairly demonized cops in their discussions of police brutality, then start passing the hat. The United States has roughly 700,000 police officers; throw in non-uniformed personnel and federal agents and you get up to about 865,000. Surely, some civilians would generously contribute to the \u201cLet\u2019s Purchase the NBA\u2019s Silence\u201d fund.\n\nIf everyone in law enforcement kicked in $579 or so \u2014 less than $50 per month \u2014 they could outbid China and sign a deal with the NBA that pressured the players into not speaking about topics that could offend U.S. police organizations. Every time there was a controversial police shooting, LeBron would have to go out in front of the cameras and declare that the situation was \u201ccomplicated,\u201d and how he felt like he just didn\u2019t know enough about the circumstances to comment, and that any of his colleagues who did comment were misinformed or not educated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s how it works now, right? Like the old joke goes, we\u2019ve established what they are; now we\u2019re just haggling over the price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Do We Do Next Regarding Turkey and the Kurds?\n\nIt would be good if tonight\u2019s Democratic presidential debate asked the candidates about what to do next regarding Turkey, the Kurds, Syria, and the couple hundred escaping ISIS. Not just denouncing the president, which will be easy, but laying out what they would do differently starting from this moment if they were sworn in and working in the Oval Office starting tomorrow.\n\nYesterday morning, Trump speculated that the Kurds are deliberately releasing Islamic State fighters to get the United States involved militarily, but that they will be \u201ceasily recaptured by Turkey or European Nations from where many came.\u201d\n\nYou may be encountering people online who deploy the same argument about this moment that the Obama administration deployed about the Iran deal: \u201cEither you agree to the administration\u2019s approach, or you want all-out war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the invitation to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to visit the White House next month has not been rescinded.\n\nKeep in mind, Turkish forces deliberately fired at U.S. positions. You hear a lot from administration defenders these days that any effort to assist the Kurds as Turkey tries to destroy them would be \u201cattacking an ally.\u201d If they\u2019re shooting at our troops, they\u2019re no longer an ally. This should be a deal-breaker and a relationship-breaker. If the Turks want to argue that the United States has never prioritized fighting the PKK enough, they\u2019re free to do that; it\u2019s now abundantly clear that they don\u2019t prioritize fighting ISIS enough for our security interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announced sanctions are nice. But there are a lot more options.\n\nEnd all U.S. arms sales to Turkey. Remove all U.S. nuclear weapons from Injirlik Air Base, along with all U.S. forces. Begin sharing intelligence with the Kurds about what we know about Turkish offensives, if we haven\u2019t already. Move to expel Turkey from NATO. We\u2019ve been lamenting the increasingly awkward nature of this alliance for the past fifteen years. As the Turkish government has been warming up to Russia and China, and increasingly hostile to their European neighbors, it\u2019s fair to ask whether this alliance still works for anyone involved. At the very least, we need to use this option as leverage. Temporarily suspend visa services at embassies, as both countries did to each other in 2017 Increase our warnings to U.S. citizens about traveling to Turkey. Stop opposing resolutions at the United Nations denouncing the Turkish incursion into Syrian territory. Recall our ambassador and or request the dismissal of theirs. (There is probably value in keeping the lines of communication open, even if it\u2019s just to make clear how furious we are about this.)\n\nThe president periodically insists that ISIS is destroyed, and more or less ignoring the escaped ISIS prisoners in his speeches. Yesterday at the Values Voters Summit, he said, \u201cSo let\u2019s see what happens. And it\u2019s a long ways away. We killed ISIS. We defeated \u2014 we did our job. We have to go home. We did our job.\u201d\n\nADDENDA: Hunter Biden gets the slowly-walking-through-a-garden interview treatment from ABC News.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don\u2019t believe now, when I look back on it \u2014 I know that there was \u2014 did nothing wrong at all,\u201d said Biden. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is . . . a swamp in \u2014 in \u2014 in many ways? Yeah.\u201d \u201cI gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That\u2019s where I made the mistake,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC News in an exclusive interview. \u201cSo I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.\u201d \u201cIf your last name wasn\u2019t Biden,\u201d Robach asked, \u201cdo you think you would\u2019ve been asked to be on the board of Burisma?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s \u2014 you know \u2014 I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d\n\nOver on the homepage, a discussion of what NR is doing against \u201cthe circus of liars\u201d that has come to town, and how you can help us.", "description": "\u201cYes, we do\u00a0have freedom of speech, it can be a lot of negative that comes with it.\u201d\u00a0\u2014 LeBron James.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Katherine Timpf", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
