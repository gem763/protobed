I never thought I\u2019d have to consider this question in a personal way. But then in 2013 my young friend abruptly disappeared from his home in Germany.\n\nSix weeks later, he emailed his mother from Syria. He had joined a group of Salafist extremists there. He tried to reassure her: \u201cI didn\u2019t leave to get away from you, remember that,\u201d he said. We later learned that he had died.\n\nThe boy was like a little brother to me. Our families lived in the same small town, and I met him when he was just 8. My family and I spent a lot of time with him until I went away to college. He disappeared right after he turned 21.\n\nHis mother still lives in my old town today. I see her angry, sad and full of self-doubt. She futilely searched for answers.", "description": "He was 21 years old.
