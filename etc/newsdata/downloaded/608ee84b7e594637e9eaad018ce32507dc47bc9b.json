Located in the Bois de Vincennes, in the eastern part of the city, the site is still under a trial phase. It will remain available to the public free of charge until October 15th, from 8.00 am to 7.30 pm.\n\nThe space is located next to a bird reserve. To avoid any confusion, warning signs have been placed on the path leading to the clearing, alerting passersby that they are approaching a nudist section.\n\nMore than 2.5 million people practice nudism in France. The country has 400 naturist public sites and a nudist open spot in its capital has been longed for.\n\nThe Paris Nudist Association celebrates the opening and hopes spaces like these will remove the taboos attributed to this practice.\n\nSpokesperson Julien Penegry said: \u201cNudism is not only a summer thing taking place on beaches during summer. It\u2019s an everyday thing. It is a way of life, with values. So, people who don\u2019t know this way of life and see in nudism something shocking, shameful or disrespectful should see the things in a different way, because nudity is nothing shameful\u201d.\n\nThe Paris mayor\u2019s office has stated that this inauguration is \u201cpart of an open-minded vision for the use of Parisian public spaces\u201d.", "description": "Paris' first nudist park opened on Thursday (August 31).
