U.S. stock markets sank on the news on Tuesday. Trump, who denies the allegations involving his potential Democratic rival for the White House, promised to release the transcript of his call Wednesday.\n\nGundlach's view coincides with financial markets' performance around impeachments.\n\nThe stock market rallied 31 percent from the time President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky made headlines to the date he was found not guilty of perjury and obstruction in a Senate trial, according to data from Dow Jones Market Data Group.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPresident Clinton poses with Monica Lewinsky in a Nov. 17, 1995 photo, that was released Sept. 21 by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr as part of more than 3,000 pages of documents pertaining to the scandal. According to Lewinsky's deposition, she an Expand\n\nImpeachment inquiry aside, Gundlach does think the 2020 nomination for the Democrats is most critical.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the betting markets, Warren has by far the greatest chance for the nomination,\u201d he said.\n\nBetting markets show Warren has a 42 percent chance of winning the Democratic nomination, according to electionbettingodds.com. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders round out the top three at 22 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way Joe Biden is going to be the nominee, there\u2019s just no way,\u201d Gundlach said. \u201cI\u2019ve been asking people, \u2018Do you know anybody that really supports Joe Biden?\u2019 and I haven\u2019t met a single person that says they know anybody that truly supports Joe Biden.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Gundlach has slammed Biden. In June, he told FOX Business' Neil Cavuto that he thought Biden was a \"placeholder type of candidate.\"\n\nGundlach says Warren is \u201cdefinitely the flavor of the month,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t think she can win a general election. He points to her stance on Medicare-for-all and getting rid of private insurance.\n\nWarren has repeatedly refused to answer questions about how she would pay for the program, leading to speculation she would raise taxes on the middle class.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can go to 160 million Americans and say you\u2019re going to get worse healthcare,\u201d Gundlach said. \u201cThat the healthcare you have now is too good, and we need to take from you so that we can improve the lot of people that have inferior healthcare. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a winning issue.\u201d\n\nGundlach says Warren scores points with voters because of her stance on a wealth tax. He notes polling has showed some 70 percent of Americans were in favor of a wealth tax, conceding that it\u2019s \u201creally hard to get 70 percent on anything.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s plan imposes a 2 percent tax on assets over $50 million and a 3 percent tax on fortunes over $1 billion.\n\nSanders, another Democratic contender, rolled out a wealth-tax plan on Tuesday that was similar to Warren\u2019s, which Gundlach says is \u201csynonymous with him ending his campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just seems like it\u2019s awful late in the game for him to wake up and just imitate Elizabeth Warren,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a sign that he knows his campaign is headed in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nAs for which would be worse for the stock market, Gundlach says that would probably be Sanders. \u201cElizabeth Warren comes across as less ideological, I think, and a little more pragmatic,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBernie is just ideologically a communist,\" Gundlach added. \"He got thrown out of a commune for being too lazy back when he was young.\"\n\nStill, Gundlach says the stock market would be selling off sharply if it were convinced that Warren was a plausible candidate.\n\n\u201cShe keeps talking on and on and on about how corporations are going to pay, they\u2019re going to pay, they\u2019re going to pay for everything, so that sounds really bad for bottom-line earnings for large American corporations,\u201d Gundlach concluded. \"But you haven\u2019t seen it yet, so that tells me that there\u2019s no coalesced opinion for what\u2019s going to happen with Warren.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach says the impeachment proceedings against President Trump are \"more theatrics than anything else.\"", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/jeffrey-gundlach-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
