The Welshman is known as something of a maverick in Welsh rugby circles, having coached Ospreys to two Celtic League titles and an Anglo-Welsh Cup victory. Speaking of his side last year, he said: There\u2019s a lot of good rugby players in Russia, and it\u2019s a sleeping giant. There are lots of plans for the long-term development of the game; at the moment it\u2019s about the short term, but there\u2019s lots of good things going on.\u201d\n\nKey player\n\nYuri Kushnarev\u200b. The fly-half was a member of the first Russian squad to compete at a Rugby World Cup, so knows what to expect competing on the highest level of the international game. The 34-year-old is Russia\u2019s most titled player, having picked up silverware with a host of clubs during his career, including 11 Russian Championships and two European Rugby Continental Shields. His experience will no doubt be drawn upon as the Bears attempt to navigate a difficult group and improve upon their 2011 outing.\n\nPast record\n\nNew Zealand 2011 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages.\n\nPrediction\n\nSuch is the quality of teams in Pool A, the Bears will do remarkably well to avoid finishing last. They look set for another early elimination.\n\nFixtures\n\nFriday 20 September \u2013 Japan vs Russia (11:45am)\u200b, Tokyo\n\nTuesday 24 September \u2013 Russia vs Samoa (11:15am)\u200b, Kumagaya\n\nThursday 3 October \u2013 Ireland vs Russia (11:15am)\u200b, Kobe\n\nWednesday 9 October \u2013 Scotland vs Russia (8:15am), Shizuoka\n\nOdds\n\nRussia to win the World Cup: 5000/1", "description": "Russia head to the Rugby World Cup in what will be their second-ever appearance at the competition, having featured in the 2011 edition.
