We will know a lot more on Tuesday and he did have a scan as a precaution.\u201d\n\nHatley also played down any fears over Joe Marler after the loosehead prop limped off in the 63rd minute of Saturday\u2019s victory, though he did confirm that he will have a check-up on a back issue on Tuesday before returning to full contact training.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Billy is an important figure for us, but other people pick up the slack.\u201d\n\nThat resonates within the rest of the pack, with hooker Jamie George fully aware that they will need to make up for Vunipola\u2019s absence.\n\n\u201cEddie made us aware of it when Billy came off at half-time,\u201d he said. \u201cHe said there will potentially be a little more responsibility for the other guys to step up and want the ball now, but you work towards the ball all the time anyway.\n\n\u201cIf he does or he doesn't play then we're all aware that we need to get our hands on the ball and impose ourselves physically.\u201d\n\nJones sent on flanker Lewis Ludlam to fill the void left by Vunipola and moved Tom Curry to No 8, doing himself no disservice in the process that looks set to see him replace the absent Saracens forward and Mark Wilson return to the squad.", "description": "Billy Vunipola will learn his injury fate on Tuesday after undergoing a scan on his ankle injury, with England\u00a0unsure how long they will be without the powerful No 8 for.
