Just like whoever buys this.\u201d\n\nPeople who've been bottling up their emotions are finally releasing them over Ms. Monopoly, and it's as weird as you would expect. pic.twitter.com/K3NSHPbDrh \u2014 Connor Stone (@stone1492) September 10, 2019\n\nStill others fear that rather than being \u201cwoke,\u201d this new game night addition is perpetuating the gender pay gap that it\u2019s meant to address.\n\nHasbro Gaming HAS, +2.29% has rolled the dice on almost 1,000 variations of the wheeling and dealing real-estate game over the past 84 years, from \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d editions, to the kid-friendly Monopoly Junior.\n\nBut \u201cMs. Monopoly\u201d celebrates female investors and entrepreneurs, bumping its monocled Mr. Monopoly real estate tycoon/mascot for Ms. Monopoly, who is described in a press release as \u201can advocate whose mission is to invest in female entrepreneurs.\u201d (She also rocks a gray blazer and holds what strongly resembles a Starbucks SBUX, -4.05% coffee cup.)\n\nBuying properties in the game is replaced with funding inventions and innovations developed by women throughout history \u2014 including Wi-Fi, solar heating, modern shapewear and chocolate chip cookies. And instead of building houses and hotels, players build business headquarters for these startups. A Hasbro spokesperson told MarketWatch that more than 30 women were involved in \u201cMs. Monopoly\u2019s\u201d creation.\n\nBut what\u2019s getting the most buzz are the revised rules that give female players financial advantages over men. The banker hands women $1,900 at the beginning of the game, while men get $1,500, for example. And female players collect $240 for passing the \u201cGo\u201d square, while males get $200.\n\nIt\u2019s meant to reflect the real-life gender pay gap, where women make just 80 cents for every dollar that men earn. It also addresses how much less funding female entrepreneurs receive compared to males, with a paltry 2.2% of venture capital in the U.S. going to female founders. In fact, Hasbro noted in its press release that it has donated about $20,580 in real money to fund young female inventors; the figure represents the amount of total paper Monopoly money included in each game.\n\nRelated: The gender wage gap is much worse than you think\n\nHasbro explained in its news release that, \u201cMs. Monopoly is also the first-ever game where women make more than men \u2014 a fun spin in the game that creates a world where women have an advantage often enjoyed by men. However, if men play their cards right, they can make more money too.\u201d\n\nMany men and women took issue with that on social media, however, stating that the original game already started with everyone on equal footing, and the man or woman who played their cards right could win the game without any handicaps.\n\n\u201cWait, is Ms. Monopoly implying that women can\u2019t win a game of Monopoly unless they have an unfair advantage?\u201d wrote one Twitter user. \u201cHow dare you insult women this way. They are just as capable of winning a game of Monopoly as any male player.\u201d\n\nWow.\n\n\n\nHasbro is perpetuating victimhood through a board game.\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re instilling in young girls that society views them \u2018less than\u2019.\n\n\n\nThe pay gap comes from PERSONAL CHOICES made by women.\n\n\n\n...... and they\u2019re calling this game \u2018female empowerment\u2019 https://t.co/Tzaqaf0n2t \u2014 Lisa Britton (@LisaBritton) September 10, 2019\n\nMs. Monopoly is ridiculous. \u201cHere sweetie, you need extra help to win\u201d. No thanks that\u2019s the opposite of empowerment. @Hasbro is pandering and it\u2019s awful #Monopoly #msmonopoly \u2014 Kristy (@kristyyounger) September 10, 2019\n\nAnd some social media users noted that the original \u201cMonopoly\u201d mastermind was a woman \u2014 Elizabeth \u201cLizzie\u201d Magie, who filed a legal claim for her \u201cLandlord\u2019s Game\u201d more than three decades before Parker Brothers began making \u201cMonopoly\u201d as we know it today.\n\nMs. Monopoly makes sense. Monopoly was made (by a woman whos idea was stolen) to teach ppl about the evils of capitalism. For 1 rich prick to win, everyone else dies in debt to them. So by imposing a gender pay inequality, its going back to its preachy roots. Do we care tho?\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/8MgCeu3zlx \u2014 LT, Andrew Yang's Coolest Black Friend (@LTspeaks) September 10, 2019\n\nA Hasbro rep told MarketWatch that these game pieces were \u201cdesigned to create conversation around gender equality and reward the important role men play in supporting female empowerment. We encourage men and women to play as either role within the game to experience a new perspective. Ultimately, we believe the game and its content embodies a positive message that we hope is embraced by a wide variety of audiences.\u201d\n\nThe toy maker also recently raised eyebrows with its satirical \u201cMonopoly: Socialism,\u201d which leans heavily on political humor as players buy into projects such as the \u201cHealthcare For All Hospital\u201d and \u201cTogether We Rise Bakery\u201d in lieu of snapping real estate properties like Boardwalk and Park Place. There was also \u201cMonopoly For Millennials\u201d last year, where players were encouraged to find \u201cthe hottest destinations\u201d to eat and relax, rather than buying real estate \u2014 because as the box said: \u201cForget real estate. You can\u2019t afford it anyway.\u201d", "description": "The new game gives female players some financial advantages over male players.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR000_MsMono_ZG_20190910101934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
