It is likely to hit at least $1.35 as the prospect of a no-deal, and/or months of further uncertainty ends.\"\n\nOf course, the reverse is also true.\n\n\"If [the deal] it fails like snakes and ladders it will be a sharp move lower back towards 1.22,\" McHugh said.\n\nAnd even if the deal does go through - the future for the pound can't be guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThis is really just the beginning \u2013 not the end,\" Green said.\n\nAndy Scott, Associate Director at JCRA, said: \u201cSterling has seen a dramatic couple of weeks. Rallying 6% versus the dollar and 5% versus the euro from its lows last Thursday, the currency\u2019s best performance against the dollar since 1985!\n\n\"However, Sterling still remains relatively weak. At the current level of 1.29 versus the Dollar and 1.16 versus the euro, sterling is still down 13% and 11% respectively compared to its peak on the eve of the referendum result.\"", "description": "The pound rocketed this morning on the news that Boris Johnson and the EU have negotiated a Brexit deal", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577857.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BRITAIN-EU-POLITICS-BREXIT-ROYALS.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
