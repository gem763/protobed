Niners cornerback Richard Sherman said the team was fueled by Baker Mayfield\u2019s handshake snub during the coin toss, according to Michael Silver of NFL.com.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nAs one of the Browns\u2019 captains, Mayfield was one of the few players on the field for the coin toss. During this time, players from both teams typically shake hands and exchange pleasantries. It\u2019s a tradition in the NFL, according to Sherman.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt also explains why Sherman was upset when he says Mayfield refused to shake hands with 49ers players before the coin toss. Sherman called it \u201csome college s---,\u201d among other things.\n\n\"What's amazing, and annoying, was him not shaking hands at the beginning,\" Sherman said. \"That's some college s---. It's ridiculous. We're all trying to get psyched up, but shaking hands with your opponent \u2014 that's NFL etiquette. And when you pull bush-league stuff, that's disrespectful to the game. And believe me, that's gonna get us fired up.\"\n\nSherman\u2019s story was thrown into question after video emerged that appears to show Mayfield shaking hands with Sherman.\n\nSo Richard Sherman claims Baker Mayfield refused to shake his hand at the coin toss. This video seems to indicate otherwise: pic.twitter.com/4CgOsLKLPL \u2014 Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) October 8, 2019\n\nSherman clarified it was Mayfield running away from the coin toss that angered the 49ers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsked @R_Sherman25 about the video out there.\n\n\n\nHe said it was Baker Mayfield darting away after the toss that angered the Niners: \"That\u2019s it. They are making way too big of a story of a blowout. He pissed us off. We put a foot in his ass. End of story.\" \u2014 Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) October 8, 2019\n\nSherman continued to defend that point for the next couple hours on Twitter. Eventually, he said everyone else was blowing the handshake out of proportion, and that he was focusing on the 49ers\u2019 next game.\n\nPpl freaking out over a handshake gave me a good laugh. I will lose no sleep over it and have moved on to the next opponent. \u2014 Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) October 8, 2019\n\nWhether or not the snub was real, the 49ers made Mayfield pay for it. The Browns scored just three points in a 31-3 blowout loss against the 49ers. Mayfield completed just eight of 22 attempts, and was held to 100 yards passing. He was picked off twice and failed to throw a touchdown. It was the first time in Mayfield\u2019s 18 starts that he did not throw a touchdown.\n\nOn top of that, Mayfield was under pressure all night. He was sacked four times, including two by No. 2 overall pick Nick Bosa. The 21-year-old Bosa was also fired up about taking down Mayfield. After forcing an incomplete pass, Bosa stood up and mimicked Mayfield\u2019s plant the flag celebration. Mayfield planted an Oklahoma flag on Ohio State\u2019s field after a win in 2017.\n\nSherman, 31, added that it\u2019s OK for Mayfield to have rivals. But the quarterback needs to put that aside in those moments, especially when Mayfield hasn\u2019t accomplished much in the NFL, Sherman told Silver.\n\n\"Respect the game,\" Sherman said, referencing Mayfield's pregame behavior. \"You can have rivals, but pay your respect in that moment \u2014 especially when you're young. \"He hasn't earned anything in this league. How many games has he won? He's acting like he was the MVP last year. If [Patrick] Mahomes did that, it would be one thing. But he would never do that, because he has too much respect for the game. \"And when you see a guy who doesn't? You humble him every chance you get. Because eventually, he will have respect for the league \u2014 or he'll be out of it.\"\n\nMayfield and the Browns have been humbled quite a bit this season. After coming into the year with huge expectations, the team has started the season just 2-3. Offensive struggles have been a big part of that. The Browns rank 25th in points per game, 19th in passing yards and have thrown eight interceptions \u2014 tied for the most in the NFL.\n\nGiven all that, the 49ers didn\u2019t need extra motivation to take down the Browns. San Francisco was the better team before Mayfield snubbed players during the coin toss.\n\nThe Browns\u2019 offense will likely get better as the season goes on. Mayfield showed plenty of promise as a rookie, and Odell Beckham Jr. remains one of the best playmakers in football. It\u2019s not going to come easy, though.\n\nMayfield has painted a target on the team\u2019s back with his cockiness and bravado. That approach works well when your team is winning. It backfires spectacularly when you struggle.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at christophercwik@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
