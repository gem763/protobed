The headpiece is of unclear origin, with one Twitter user accusing the singer of throwing together \"random\" items to \"look exotic.\"\n\nKacey Musgraves is receiving backlash after posting photos on Instagram wearing a traditional Vietnamese ao dai dress.

CNN has reached out to her representatives for comment.\n\nMusgraves joins a growing list of celebrities to face accusations of cultural appropriation in recent months. In June, Kim Kardashian West faced fierce backlash after she launched a (now-renamed) lingerie brand called Kimono -- also the name of a centuries-old Japanese garment -- and Rihanna was criticized in July for posing in traditional Chinese clothing on the cover of Harper's Bazaar China.\n\nWhile the latter faced outcry from Chinese-Americans at the time, many people in mainland China expressed praise for the photo shoot. Musgraves, however, appears to have angered both the Vietnamese diaspora and those within the country.\n\nVietnamese actor and singer Ngo Thanh Van, also known as Veronica Ngo, wrote on Facebook that \"it is wrong for the singer to wear a traditional costume of another country without understanding it.\"\n\nIt's a debate we've seen play out many times in recent months -- so when does appreciation become appropriation?\n\nTommy Tse, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN in July that it's a difficult line to draw -- but people may be able to reduce the risk of backlash by taking context into consideration and consulting people from the culture they're paying tribute to, he said.\n\n\"There (are) ways to do it respectfully -- unfortunately, Kacey's wasn't one of them,\" Nguyen wrote.\n\nAt the time of publication, Kacey Musgrave's representatives have not responded to CNN's request for comment.", "description": "Country singer Kacey Musgraves is under fire for styling a traditional Vietnamese garment in a way that many people found to be inappropriate for a concert in Dallas, Texas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191017164610-kacey-musgraves-top-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
