Another was released in March.\n\nOfficials said Abdul Rashid Baluch, who was among those released Sunday, was caught smuggling nearly a ton of opium on the Afghanistan-Iran border five years ago. Before his release Sunday, he\u2019d been sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n\nTaliban officials said among others released were Sheikh Abdur Rahim and Mawlawi Abdur Rashid, who were governors of the Taliban administration in Kunar and Nimroz provinces before U.S. forces overthrew the group in 2001.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t initially known whether Sunday\u2019s exchange was related to fleeting negotiations among U.S., Afghan and Taliban officials to end fighting in Afghanistan and withdraw U.S. troops.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The government in Afghanistan has freed nearly a dozen Taliban militant commanders, including a notorious opium smuggler, in exchange", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
