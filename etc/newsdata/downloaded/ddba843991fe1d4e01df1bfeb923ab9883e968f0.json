Anwar can bat for us too and as far as Hamza is concerned so he is bowling with good pace and can be lethal for us in the shorter format of the game,\u201d he concluded.\n\nIt must be noted here that Anwar has not played any form of cricket since March. He had gone through a successful heel surgery in April this year.\n\nSix regions including Southern Punjab, Central Punjab, Sindh, Northern, Baluchistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will participate in the event.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Sindh's head coach Azam Khan has announced 16-member first XI squad for the upcoming National T20 Cup, penciled in from October 13 to 24 in Rawalpindi.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
