Others in the list include designer Karl Lagerfeld, German footballer Andre Schurrle, web video producer Felix von der Laden and US businesswoman Meg Whitman.\n\nPublishing their findings in the journal Annals of Tourism Research, researchers trawled through the celebrities\u2019 Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and media reports to ascertain whether they flew privately or commercially.\n\nSteffan Gossling, the lead author, said the emergence of the concept of flygskam, which is Swedish for \u201cflight shame\u201d, had prompted more questions about the impact of frequent flyers.\n\nHe called on governments to \u201cstem the growing class of very affluent people who contribute very significantly to emissions and encourage everyone else to aspire to such damaging lifestyles\u201d.\n\nThe study added: \u201cScheduled air traffic, even though twice as energy-intense in business/first class, requires only a fraction of the energy consumed by private jets.\u201d\n\nRich Actress Emma Thompson Flies 5,400 Miles to Protest Climate Change https://t.co/m6KkjE27C4 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 19, 2019\n\nLast month Breitbart News reported producer Gavin Polone similarly taking Hollywood bigshots to task over their addiction to private jet travel. He said celebrities and studio executives are guilty of hypocrisy when they promote climate change activism while refusing to fly commercial.\n\nPolone, who produced the recent movie A Dog\u2019s Journey as well as HBO\u2019s Curb Your Enthusiasm, wrote in a column for The Hollywood Reporter saying the entertainment industry is undercutting its own climate change message by relying on the convenience and privacy that these planes afford.\n\n\u201cNothing is more undermining to the \u2018stop climate change\u2019 message than accusations of hypocrisy against the most prominent advocates for environmental responsibility,\u201d Polone wrote.\n\nThe article featured photographs of noted environmental and climate change activist Leonardo DiCaprio disembarking from a private jet. Other photos show stars Katy Perry and Dwayne Johnson using private planes.\n\nHollywood is not alone in its addiction to constant air travel while lecturing others to stay at home.\n\nMembers of the British Royal family have also been accused of hypocrisy this past summer, with Prince Harry drawing publicity when he flew to Amsterdam to caution holidaymakers and tourism chiefs about the damage being done to the environment by frequent flyers.\n\nBarefoot Prince Harry Warns World: Climate Change Must Be Addressed https://t.co/9q7Zkbfqau \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 1, 2019\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, his speech, promoting the eco-tourism project with Booking.com, Sky Scanner, TripAdvisor and Visa, book-ended a number of trips he took his family on over the summer which at one time saw the Duke and Duchess of Sussex \u2013 aka Prince Harry and the former Meghan Markle \u2013 taking their four private jet flight in 11 days.\n\nPrince Harry previously said he and his wife will have no more than two children because of the elevated concerns they have for the planet.\n\n\u201cWe are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us, and only us,\u201d he revealed in an interview with ethologist Dr Jane Goodall for the September issue of British Vogue.\n\nIn August Prince Harry flew by private jet to Sicily to warn an elite audience of business leaders and celebrities gathered at Google\u2019s annual deluxe retreat that immediate action is needed to avoid an approaching climate catastrophe.\n\nMore recently Harry and Meghan made a long haul flight to Africa to spread their climate advocacy to a new audience.
