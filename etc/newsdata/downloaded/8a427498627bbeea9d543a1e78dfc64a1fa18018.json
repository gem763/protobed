He then was spitting everything up,\" Winters said.\n\nCourtesy Tyra Winters\n\nThe boy\u2019s mom, Nicole Hornback, told ABC News that she had tried to perform the Heimlich on her son, 2-year-old Clarke, but wasn\u2019t successful.\n\n\"I just literally was holding him out and just running through the crowd trying to hand him off to anyone,\" Hornback said.\n\nShe called Winters \"very brave\" and praised her for being so willing to take a child\u2019s life in her own hands.\n\nThe three reunited Tuesday, but Clarke didn\u2019t remember Winters.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard for him because he\u2019s so young,\" she said. \"He doesn\u2019t even remember what he ate for breakfast.\"\n\nWinters said even so, the two had a good time together and shared a high-five.\n\nShe's grateful that she could be there for Clarke, and that her mother taught her the Heimlich a few years ago.\n\n\"I knew exactly what to do from that point on,\" Winters said.", "description": "A Texas cheerleader is being praised for saving a choking toddler during her homecoming parade.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/cheerleader-hero-flt-ht-ps-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
