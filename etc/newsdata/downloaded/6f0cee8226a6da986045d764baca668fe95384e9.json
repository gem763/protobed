Not Always Comfortably", "language": "en", "text": "Messaging apps that can make their messages disappear, such as WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram, have become more widespread in the workplace. The services, which allow users to delete content within a short period, are used both for casual conversations and sensitive conversations. But their presence in the workplace is creating tension, particularly for companies that have to log communications and maintain records.\n\nWhile some companies, including Deutsche Bank, have banned their use, those that haven\u2019t must figure out how to strike a balance between appropriate business-related communications and protecting employees\u2019 privacy rights.\n\nWith different options available, and the appropriateness of some under scrutiny, The Wall Street Journal hosted a conversation by email with four experts on digital communication in the workplace: Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C.; Ifeoma Ajunwa, an assistant professor of labor and employment law at Cornell University\u2019s Industrial and Labor Relations School and the author of a soon-to-be-released book on technology in the workplace; Allen Chiu, chief compliance officer and global head of litigation at Genesys, a contact-center software company; and Jacqueline Cooney, senior director of privacy and cybersecurity at the law firm Paul Hastings in Washington, D.C. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nWSJ: What should companies think about when designing policies that cover these apps? How far can they go in limiting their use by employees?\n\nMS. COONEY: We have heard, anecdotally, that one of the issues companies are facing is that their younger employees like to use these apps. They are a trendy and popular way of communicating. The apps are often easier to use and offer more features than traditional email or even texting provides. Therefore, companies should take into consideration the demographic of their employees and their employee preferences when considering whether to allow ephemeral messaging apps.\n\nJacqueline Cooney\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: Young people are certainly more comfortable messaging than using email for quick communication. But a company compliance lead I was working with was most concerned about her senior-executive team, all of whom texted each other on urgent confidential matters on the weekends. An important solution is making sure there are available messaging apps that are easy to use, and using the compliant enterprise versions.\n\nEmail initially entered the workplace with personal AOL and Hotmail accounts. Eventually enterprise versions that had retention policies and controls came out and were adopted. With enterprise Slack, Atlassian and others, the market is moving in the same direction, leaning to allowing use of the popular tools, but with employer-customized options.\n\nDR. AJUNWA: It is also important for employers to understand that this type of messaging raises their liability risks. For example, employees may use such communication channels to harass other employees, and the employer\u2019s tacit approval [of such apps] or lack of enforcement of rules against using those types of communication channels would make the employer bear some of the legal blame for the harassment.\n\nWSJ: Doesn\u2019t setting a policy around how employees use apps like Snapchat invade their privacy?\n\nMR. CHIU: Employee privacy is important\u2014but it should not be the only consideration when considering the use of these types of messaging applications. There is a balance that needs to be struck between the need for employees to retain their privacy interests in personal discussions and for companies to maintain adequate controls over legitimate business records. Without a policy around the use of disappearing-message applications, that balance does not give enough weight to the fact that companies need to be able to document and understand transactions, investigate corporate misconduct and defend themselves against claims in litigation.\n\nAllen Chiu\n\nMS. COONEY: In the U.S., there is no clear right to employee privacy. Employers can and should create clear, thoughtful rules around use of their devices, software and applications, and how employees will be monitored on employer equipment and in employer facilities. Employees should be familiar with the rules of their organization and the communications channels they are allowed to use and for what purposes.\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: Employees should be able to use confidential channels for their personal communications. But their employer needs to ensure they don\u2019t do so on a device that may also hold sensitive data\u2014patient records, financial records or other sensitive information\u2014unless that data is segregated and protected. The employee\u2019s individual right to privacy needs to be balanced with the risk to the privacy or safety of others, and the requirements to maintain confidential employer data.\n\nWSJ: What about when employees text or use other apps to communicate on personal phones? How does a company retain business communications that employees have had on messaging apps using a personal phone?\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: In general, mobile-device-management software can be a key solution here, compartmentalizing the employer\u2019s apps and information on a personal phone, and separating the personal information of employees. It\u2019s a good idea to use mobile-device-management software that shows employees what data is being monitored to ensure employees understand the scope of the monitoring.\n\nA key challenge for employers is that messaging apps may upload business contacts and other business information stored in mobile-phone contacts to their own servers or transfer data across countries, in ways that violate employer privacy policies or data-protection agreements. The newest versions of mobile operating systems can be set to control this, when combined with mobile-device-management software.\n\nIfeoma Ajunwa\n\nDR. AJUNWA: I do not think a company should try to retain communications that an employee has had on a personal phone. While in the U.S. workers generally do not have privacy protections when it comes to using employer-provided devices, the use of a personal device is generally considered outside the purview of the employer. The issue with imposing any kind of data-retention regime, however, is that this might also be seen as tacit permission from the employer for the employee to use ephemeral messaging apps.\n\nMS. COONEY: If a company has data-retention requirements, ephemeral messaging apps, by definition, cannot comply with them. There are messaging apps that are more appropriate in business settings that allow information to be retained and recalled if necessary. However, if messages are truly meant to \u201cdisappear,\u201d then the information relayed in those communications should be restricted to include nonsubstantive topics, such as arranging times and places to meet, or for personal messaging not related to any business.\n\nWSJ: Are there any benefits to using these types of apps for work? Aren\u2019t they more secure from hackers?\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: For certain professions or certain high-security situations, encrypted apps and even ephemeral apps are a key tool for employees. Domestic-violence counselors communicating with a vulnerable victim, journalists with high-risk sources, those traveling in countries where government surveillance is a risk should all look to encrypted services. In those situations, confidentiality will outweigh other issues. Employers should make sure the employees are trained on the limitations of these apps so they can use them wisely.\n\nDR. AJUNWA: I concur, but it\u2019s important to note that there is a very limited number of professions in which ephemeral-messaging apps could be useful. Even then, it\u2019s important to recognize that many ephemeral-messaging apps are still vulnerable to de-encryption as security flaws have been discovered in apps like WhatsApp, Signal, etc.\n\nWSJ: So when and how should employees use disappearing-message apps?\n\nJules Polonetsky\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: Organizations should make it clear to employees that they should not use private-communications channels for work-related purposes. Companies handling financial data, health data or other sensitive data have obligations to ensure employees don\u2019t send private files to unauthorized parties. They also have obligations to hand over information that is the subject of litigation, and they need to have internal governance rules about employee communications. Third-party apps that operate completely outside the employer\u2019s governance make it impossible to protect sensitive company data.\n\nMR. CHIU: The expectations regarding employees\u2019 use of ephemeral or disappearing-message apps have been an area of focus for the Justice Department, particularly in the context of corruption investigations. In 2017, the Justice Department provided initial guidance regarding the extent to which companies were expected to have adequate data-retention policies\u2014suggesting that companies should prohibit employees from using messaging apps that did not adequately retain business communications or records altogether. Since then, the Justice Department has revised its stance. [Such apps are no longer banned. But] companies need to have clearly identified policies that address the use of these types of messaging apps, and in turn, those policies should be communicated broadly to employees.\n\nWSJ: Rather than limiting their use to nonwork matters, is there an argument that companies should ban disappearing-message apps from the workforce?\n\nDR. AJUNWA: My answer is yes. Employers should have an official policy banning employees from using ephemeral messaging apps for specifically business-related communications. Employers don\u2019t have the purview to control personal communications, but they can set rules for business communications. Allowing employees to use disappearing-message apps for business communications opens the employer to unnecessary liability. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good argument to say that because younger workers are using these apps that makes them acceptable or appropriate in the workplace. Rather, I think that employers should just take the hard line of banning these apps in the context of work. Trying to create rules for their use in the workplace makes the employer ultimately responsible for when such use contravenes the law or creates a hostile work environment.\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: I think employers need to be realistic and pragmatic. In some sense, the issue of employees acting inappropriately outside the reach of the company isn\u2019t new. Business conversations happen in restaurants and in bars. Ephemeral conversations happen in hallways. Conversations take place without being recorded on telephones. Email and computers brought much more communication to the workplace, but also brought it into view for the first time, along with opportunities and obligations for compliance and tracking.\n\nNow, some communications are moving back out of reach, as technology catches up to the expectations of people. We don\u2019t expect everything we say to be documented for posterity. Ephemeral communications initially caught on with teens not because of privacy, but because they were a more casual way to communicate, a better reflection of many of our trivial exchanges. Yes, we need policies to ensure businesses can protect against data breaches and abuse, but it\u2019s not a terrible thing to recognize that we need some room for casual chatter that doesn\u2019t linger.\n\nWSJ: If employees are allowed to use such apps, is there a risk that using these apps will create the impression of trying to hide something?\n\nMS. COONEY: I doubt that most employees use these apps specifically for the purposes of having secret conversations that can\u2019t be recorded. The apps are as much about functionality as they are about confidentiality. Companies that want to allow these apps would be well positioned to understand the potential risks if they evaluated several different options and chose one that they believe fits their needs and risk appetite.\n\nMR. POLONETSKY: These apps have become so commonplace that there really shouldn\u2019t be a perception that an employee at most companies is hiding something by using a popular messaging app. It may indeed be the case in some government agencies, where it is clear some may be improperly moving communications that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act or congressional scrutiny into messaging that evades review.\n\nMr. Kassel is a writer in New York.
