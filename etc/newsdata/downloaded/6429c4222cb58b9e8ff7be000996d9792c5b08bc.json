REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe former U.S. vice president survived another Democratic debate on Thursday largely unbloodied and unbowed, leaving those on the margins of the race for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination wondering if their time to gain ground on the front-runner is running out.\n\nIf anything, the third Democratic debate in Houston was notable for how few of the nine other candidates took hard swings at Biden, a marked contrast from earlier debates when his record was more directly challenged.\n\nThe evening likely left the race fairly much as it was before the debate, with Biden holding a sizeable, but not overwhelming lead over U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nNone of the other 17 Democratic presidential candidates seeking the chance to battle Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election have more than 4% support, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.\n\nBiden seemed more vulnerable than ever coming into the debate, facing persistent questions about his age, verbal slip-ups and performance on the campaign trail.\n\nBut on Thursday, his resilience and forceful defence of his record as a U.S. senator and No. 2 to former President Barack Obama left wide open the question of who else in the field might rise to shake up the race.\n\n\u201cMost had a decent night, but the front-runners are still the front-runners,\u201d said Leah Daughtry, a Democratic strategist in South Carolina, a critical early voting state in next year\u2019s nominating contests.\n\nFEW FIREWORKS\n\nIt was the first time Warren was on a debate stage with Biden and the matchup between the old-school Democratic centrist and the spirited progressive senator from Massachusetts was widely anticipated.\n\nYet it produced no fireworks, as Warren stuck to her pattern of not criticizing other Democrats.\n\nMore fortunate for the 76-year-old Biden: Aside from a few slips of the tongue, he provided little ammunition for those who argue he is too old or too out of step to be the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nRather, most of the candidates stressed party unity and worried aloud about not appearing divided in front of the American people, a shift from earlier debates where intraparty conflict was the story.\n\nWhen Biden\u2019s rivals on stage did go on the attack, their attempts largely backfired. Most notable was a guided missile fired by Julian Castro, the U.S. housing secretary under Obama, who worked hard to portray Biden as past his prime.\n\nCastro, 44, alleged Biden was \u201cforgetting\u201d something he had said a few minutes earlier and then followed it up by charging that he, not Biden, was the better steward of Obama\u2019s legacy, resulting in audible gasps from the large crowd in attendance.\n\nAs it turned out, Castro was incorrect about what Biden had said earlier.\n\nBiden\u2019s advisers criticized Castro for what they called a \u201ccheap shot\u201d and argued that Castro had not learnt the lesson of the first two debates - attacking Biden does not pay off.\n\n\u201cCastro went too far, tone-wise,\u201d said Delacey Skinner, a Democratic strategist in Washington who is unaffiliated with a campaign. \u201cThe jab at Biden\u2019s age was cringeworthy.\u201d\n\nEven U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a candidate on stage with Biden, told ABC News afterward that Castro\u2019s attack was \u201cso personal and so unnecessary.\u201d\n\nAsked afterward about the charge he had taken a cheap shot, Castro told MSNBC: \u201cI completely disagree,\u201d and said he was not suggesting Biden was too old but seeking to highlight their policy differences on healthcare.\n\nBiden was helped as well by several candidates paying homage to Obama\u2019s record, which reinforced Biden\u2019s long-standing argument that he is best positioned to build on the former president\u2019s achievements and reverse Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nBiden himself seized on Obama\u2019s popularity with Democrats early on, by suggesting that Warren lined up with Sanders, a self-described socialist, on policy issues, while he mirrored Obama.\n\nIn doing so, Biden drew a sharp distinction between himself and his two closest challengers. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nSkinner said another candidate who probably helped himself the most on Thursday was Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former Texas congressman who has refashioned his campaign persona in the aftermath of last month\u2019s shootings in his hometown of El Paso that killed 22.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who has made gun control his animating issue, vowed unequivocally to call for an assault weapons ban if elected president in a statement that quickly went viral on social media.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll generate some buzz out of this performance,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cThe question will be whether or not he can capitalise on it and sustain it.\u201d\n\nThe good news for the lesser candidates on the stage on Thursday is that all of them have already qualified for the October debate, where they will be joined by at least one other contender.\n\nThat should ensure the debates will again be split into two evenings, but this time in smaller groups, which may give the candidates more time to make their case to an electorate that, to date, has largely ignored them.", "description": "Those expecting Joe Biden's presidential candidacy to flame out any day now will have to keep waiting.", "authors": ["James Oliphant", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429328252&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0DP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
