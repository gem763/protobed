This has been blamed on a defective part fitted by SAA Technical, according to the report.", "description": "Sunday Times reported on Sunday morning that SAA admitted that had been infiltrated by an international crime syndicate which looted hundreds of millions from the airline through dodgy tenders, which may have included the supply of dodgy parts.", "authors": ["Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6061/3142ad8c76254704bcd86fcbe0e37964.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
