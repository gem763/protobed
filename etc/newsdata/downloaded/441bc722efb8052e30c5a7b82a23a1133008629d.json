It was updated on Aug. 17.]\n\nIn July 2008, Colonel Michael Stahlman was about to come home from Iraq for R&R with his family when the military lawyer and former flight officer was found in his quarters with a gunshot wound to the head. He died about two months later.\n\nAuthorities called it a suicide. But Stahlman's wife Kim and daughter MacKenna say the man they loved would never have killed himself.\n\n\"My dad \u2026 devoted his life to his country. He was a patriot,\" said MacKenna.\n\n\"Someone shot him,\" Kim told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Peter Van Sant.\n\n\"Are you certain of that?\" Van Sant asked.\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" she replied.\n\nKim Stahlman says her husband was right-handed, but his wound was on the left side -- and his job helping rebuild Iraq's legal system could easily have made him enemies.\n\n\"I just feel like it was somebody Mike knew,\" she said.\n\nAt the heart of the mystery: an email that was sent just hours before the gunshot:\n\n\"Kim, sorry about what you are about the [sic] find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love, Mike.\"\n\nBut was it really a suicide note?\n\n\"The evidence shows there's no way he could have done what they said he did,\" Kim told Van Sant.\n\nAsked if she's in denial, Kim told Van Sant, \"No, no.\"\n\nKim started pushing the investigating agency, NCIS, for more information. And she soon enlisted some important allies: Cilla McCain, is an author and advocate for bereaved military families.\n\n\"I just do not believe that he pulled that trigger,\" said McCain.\n\nAnd Michael Maloney, is a forensic consultant who had once worked for NCIS.\n\n\"This is a homicide. There was someone else in that room,\" he said.\n\nMaloney had left NCIS before the Stahlman incident, but NCIS hired blood stain expert Mark Reynolds.\n\n\"I see no evidence of homicide in the materials provided to me whatsoever,\" he told Van Sant.\n\nReynolds says Michael Maloney is guessing, or just plain wrong.\n\n\"There's no evidence to support anything other than a suicide,\" Reynolds said.\n\nTwo experts, two very different views.\n\n\"If this was a suicide, I would have to accept it\" Kim said. \"But it's hard when you know that that's not what it was. \u2026 the truth needs to come out.\"\n\nFIGHTING FOR THE TRUTH\n\nKim Stahlman: You have to be strong as a military wife.\n\nFor more than 10 years, Kim Stahlman has been at war. With a small group of allies, she is targeting the toughest hill in Washington D.C.\u2014Capitol Hill\n\nKim Stahlman: All I've ever done is tell them that I want the truth.\n\nShe says she's trying to honor the legacy of her husband, Col. Michael Stahlman, one of the highest-ranking American fatalities in the Iraq War.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is a guy that gave his all.\n\nColonel Stahlman was a decorated Marine; a flight officer and a military lawyer. In July 2008, just weeks from going home for R&R, he was found with a gunshot wound to the head on a Ramadi military base. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner ruled it a suicide, but Kim has never believed her husband shot himself.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was not self-inflicted. Absolutely not. Someone shot him.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Someone shot him?\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Are you certain of that?\n\nKim Stahlman: I have no doubt.\n\nKim says her ultimate goal is to get that manner of death changed on the death certificate.\n\nKim Stahlman It's important to have the truth on that document \u2026 because of the man that Mike was.\n\nSuzanna Andrews | Reporter: He was just this all-American guy. \u2026 very confident, very decent.\n\nSuzanna Andrews and Mike Stahlman lived on the same block in Chevy Chase, Maryland, as teenagers.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: My mother still remembers him as the most polite child any of us ever brought home.\n\nDecades later, she wrote about his death as a contributing editor for \"More\" magazine.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I started out wanting to know what had really happened.\n\nMike Stahlman, son of a U.S. diplomat, had lived in India, Jordan and Panama as a boy before returning home to become one of a few good men.\n\nMichael Stahlman, a decorated Marine, a flight officer and a military lawyer, was described as an \"All-American guy\" and \"poster boy\" for the Marines Kim Stahlman\n\nPeter Van Sant: Was there a pride there and a sense of I really wanna serve my country?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh yeah. \u2026 I mean, he's the one that elected to go to a Marine \u2026 military academy in the 9th grade.\n\nAs a cadet, Stahlman was a Marine recruiter's dream. He appeared in a promotional video.\n\nBy April of 1987, Michael Stahlman was in flight school in Pensacola, Florida, when he landed in a bar in Florence, South Carolina, and boldly approached a striking woman across the room.\n\nPeter Van Sant: And what did you think when you looked at this guy?\n\nKim Stahlman: To be honest with you? \u2026 I didn't think anything, you know?\n\nBut she admits something about the swashbuckling young flight officer struck a chord - especially after they ran into each other again the next day at an air show.\n\nKim Stahlman: He came up to me, he said, \"You remember me?\" And I'm like ah, \"Yeah.\"\n\nStahlman offered to show her around, but she says he was quickly distracted by the triplet baby boys of someone she knew.\n\nKim Stahlman: And he stopped, and he got down on his knee and he was talking to the -- these triplets \u2026 And I thought, \"Oh, my God. That's someone special right there.\" And that's when I knew. I knew!\n\nIn less than three weeks, Kim and Mike's relationship took off.\n\n\"This was my soulmate,\" Kim Stahlman said of her husband Michael. \"He'd done so much. He was worldly. He was kind.\" Kim Stahlman\n\nKim Stahlman: He rode his motorcycle up and that's when he proposed to me.\n\nPeter Van Sant: The guy has Hollywood good looks. He's a pilot. And he's riding a motorcycle. This is like \"Top Gun.\"\n\nKim Stahlman: He sold his motorcycle for my -- first ring, too. He was a gem.\n\nThey married six months later. Two daughters followed: MacKenna in 1997, and Piper in 2004.\n\nMacKenna is 21 now and still remembers her father's kind heart.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: During Christmas it was his duty -- was the cameraman. \u2026 We'd wake up and we're, like, \"Don't go in the room until Dad has the camera ready.\" And -- that was probably one of the earliest memories I have.\n\nLike many military families, the Stahlmans moved around the world: South Carolina, California, and Japan, where Kim says she co-founded a counseling program on the base.\n\nKim Stahlman: We worked specifically with rape victims and spousal abuse victims.\n\nMike's career was on the move, too. By the early 1990s, he'd traded in his wings for a law degree. Kim says all the work and travel took a toll.\n\nKim Stahlman: We moved every two -- sometimes every year.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is it fair to say there was some trouble in the marriage?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, yeah. We have ups and downs like everybody else.\n\nAfter about 20 years of high-stress military life, Mike Stahlman had risen through the ranks to become a full colonel.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was about to retire.\n\nBut there still was one thing Col. Stahlman wanted to do. He'd never been deployed to a combat zone.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: He volunteered.\n\nKim Stahlman: This is his last hurrah, you know. He wants to do this.\n\nAbout three months after he arrived in Iraq, something happened to Michael Stahlman \u2013 something that even a Marine's family could never have expected.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: My mom \u2026 sat me down. And she was, like, \"Something's happened to your father.\"\n\nA CRYPTIC EMAIL\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: We would receive incoming every now and then. There'd be shots fired.\n\nIn July 2008, Gary Morrell was a Marine gunnery sergeant in Iraq when he picked Col. Michael Stahlman up at the airport.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Good guy?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Good -- oh, awesome, outstanding.\n\nColonel Stahlman would be stationed at Camp Ramadi. The area had seen some of the fiercest fighting earlier in the war.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: The front gate is still getting shot at, vehicles getting hit \u2026 it's still a rough area.\n\nDay-to-day life was tough. But Morell says Col. Stahlman, who was working to help rebuild Iraq's legal system, stood strong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you ever sense that he was depressed?\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Oh, never.\n\nA triathlete, Stahlman was known to work out every morning.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: He was always such a happy man. I don't ever recall him being upset or sad. I don't remember him crying, ever.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did Mike have any history of depression?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nCol. Michael Stahlman Kim Stahlman\n\nBy the summer of 2008, Kim says Mike was looking forward to coming home for R&R to spend time with her and the girls.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: We were so close. I mean it was the home stretch.\n\nIn June, he emailed: \"\u2026just 2 more months until I come home. Missing you terribly!!!\" and in late July, the day before the shooting: \"\u2026everything is great!\"\n\nSgt. Morell saw Stahlman the night before the shooting.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: He was anxious to go home, he was ready.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: In the morning he wakes up. He goes running, we believe.\n\nDave Fuentes: I was \u2026 talking to some of the other medics, when the call came in.\n\nArmy Medic Dave Fuentes says he was just coming off shift at about 8 a.m., when he responded to a shooting scene.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What condition was Colonel Stahlman in when you first laid eyes on him?\n\nDave Fuentes: He was in very rough shape.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Critical condition?\n\nDave Fuentes: Absolutely 100 percent critical.\n\nIt was still the previous night back in Connecticut, where Kim and the kids were visiting her parents. At about 11 p.m., she says she found a cryptic email in her inbox \u2013 apparently from her husband. The email became central to this case.\n\nKim Stahlman [reading email]: Kim, sorry about \u2026 what you are about to find out. I love you and always will. You and the girls are the best thing that ever happened to me. Love Mike.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What did you think?\n\nKim Stahlman: Honestly, I immediately thought one of our close friends had been killed.\n\nThe next morning, Kim got a devastating phone call.\n\nKim Stahlman: They said -- \"We're calling \u2026 to inform you that your husband, Colonel Michael Ross Stahlman, was found this morning \u2026 with a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his left temple.\n\nHer husband was still alive, but unconscious.\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like they took my past, my present and my future from me in that one phone call.\n\nKim says she was in shock. To some, that last email to her read like a suicide note. Kim had the email examined by a linguist.\n\nKim Stahlman: She said, \"This is not a suicide note.\"\n\nSgt. Morell says he doesn't see it as a suicide note, either. He says Marines are trained to avoid divulging too much information when writing home from war zones.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You gotta talk in code \u2026 This is something that I could see me sending my wife and I felt I've sent her that letter before.\n\nHe says the email could have been a reference to any number of things, including a dangerous or classified military operation or personal finances.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I could think of, his eyes. His beautiful eyes.\n\nA few days later, Kim and her daughters arrived at Mike's bedside at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, where he'd been flown for treatment.\n\nKim Stahlman: And I walked in the room and it didn't even look like him. His face was so swollen.\n\nDays turned into weeks with no improvement. Slowly Michael Stahlman was slipping away.\n\nAfter Mike had been in the hospital about two months, Kim decided to sit 11-year-old MacKenna down to say her father would be taken off life support.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: And she was like \u2026 we're not detecting any more brain waves \u2026 and that's when I had to lay in bed with him and say goodbye for the last time. \u2026 I just remember, like, the lights being dimmed, and I can still smell the hospital room [cries].\n\nThe Stahlman family Kim Stahlman\n\nColonel Michael Stahlman died on Oct. 5, 2008, the day before his 21st wedding anniversary and the month before his 46th birthday.\n\nKim Stahlman: I've never seen anyone die before. \u2026 I literally saw his spirit leave his body.\n\nHis funeral was at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It was a closed casket. I just was hysterical pretty much the whole day.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Kim says she was still troubled by the information authorities had given her -- beginning with the detail that Mike, a righty, had been shot on the left side of his head.\n\nKim Stahlman: Mike did nothing with his left hand.\n\nAs time went on, her skepticism turned to anger and determination to find the truth.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You became an investigator.\n\nKim Stahlman: Yeah.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Kim said right away, \"I wanna do my own investigation.\"\n\nWriter Suzanna Andrews says Col. Stahlman's job easily could have made him a murder target.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Mike was in Iraq at a time when we were trying to sort of put the country back on its feet after the war.\n\nColonel Stahlman's work notes suggest he was aware of local officials on the take. He wrote: \"We want to stop IP's [Iraqi Police] from taking bribes.\" And Andrews says some U.S. contractors were corrupt.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: I think it would be really \u2026 hard to \u2026 have not stumbled across some kind of corruption there.\n\nSgt. Morell says Marines were vulnerable everywhere -- even on base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You know, our perimeter was very open.\n\nHe says the security fences were a joke.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: You could get on and get off.\n\nPeter Van Sant: So, somebody from the outside could just come onto base.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Correct.\n\nKim says it's also possible Col. Stahlman had enemies closer than he thought.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If Mike did not take his own life, who did?\n\nKim Stahlman: Gut instinct is \u2026 it was somebody Mike knew and close in rank.\n\nPeter Van Sant: If you believe it's a homicide \u2026 somebody had to pull that trigger.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Give me a sense of the banter that was going' around.\n\nGunnery Sgt. Gary Morell: That it was somebody inside. You know, strictly all rumors.\n\nMedic Dave Fuentes says he remembers hearing rumors, too, about a crime at a nearby facility \u2013 a crime he heard Michael Stahlman may have been investigating.\n\nDave Fuentes: A couple other high-ranking personnel \u2026 had been relieved of duty due to -- stealing fuel from post and selling it to the locals.\n\nBy a year after the shooting, Kim Stahlman had decided to go on the offensive. And before long, she had some very influential allies.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: All of the evidence that I have, and all of the reconstruction I've done, point to this being a homicide, and absolutely not to being a suicide.\n\nA QUEST BEGINS\n\nAfter her husband's death, Kim Stahlman was paralyzed by grief.\n\nKim Stahlman: It's like a punch in the stomach\u2026\n\nKim Stahlman: \u2026 he loved his girls. He wouldn't have left 'em\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: She was basically a recluse. She never left the house. And it was really rough seeing her like that.\n\nKim emerged from her fog of grief and began a quest for the facts about her husband's death. In October 2008, she filed a Freedom of Information request with NCIS, which had arrived at the scene some hours after Stahlman was found. Kim says she received about 1,500 documents and a small batch of photos.\n\n\"The military says that my husband committed suicide, but I know it was murder,\" Kim Stahlman told \"48 Hours.\" CBS News\n\nKim Stahlman: They didn't really show you anything. You know? And they were copies of copies. Like the photocopies.\n\nScouring the reports, Kim says she learned her husband had been found in bed, lying on his back, next to a bloodstained nightstand. A bloodied sheet was hanging from the top bunk obscuring his body. A Bible and family photo lay next to him. Stahlman's 9 mm Beretta was on the bed, too. One first responder noted the gun appeared wedged between him and the mattress.\n\nInvestigators took photos of Michael Stahlman's quarters in Ramadi, Iraq, after he was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Responders found Stahlman in his bed [bottom bunk] with a sheet hanging down from the top bunk, obscuring him from view. Evidence photo\n\nSuzanna Andrews: The gun is half under him around his waist but pointed down.\n\nAccording to NCIS documents, a bullet from his gun traveled through his head, then through a wall and came to rest on the floor of a storage locker in the housing unit next door. An earwitness had reported hearing a loud noise around sunrise. The information did not satisfy Kim.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were little flags, things that jumped out at me.\n\nBelieving the suicide determination had been made in haste, Kim says she wanted a closer investigation of the case. In the coming years, she would contact the military, members of Congress, and even the White House.\n\nKim Stahlman: I was looking \u2026 for anything any \u2013 any help I could get.\n\nSince the shooting, Kim had been fighting her war alone. But in 2009, she met an important ally: author Cilla McCain.\n\nCilla McCain: She was grieving, totally grief stricken, but fighting.\n\nMcCain has a special interest in mysterious military deaths. She supports the families with a website and advocates for them with lawmakers.\n\nCilla McCain: I know of 166 families who believe that their loved one was murdered and it has been labeled a suicide.\n\nTogether, Kim and McCain say they took on the U.S. military.\n\nSuzanna Andrews: Here was this duo, these Southern women \u2026 up against this brass wall. You know, all these officers and soldiers and institutions who just didn't take them seriously at all.\n\nBefore long, word of their war would win them another important ally. This one had a worldwide reputation investigating cases at, of all places, NCIS itself.\n\nMike Maloney | Former NCIS: If it bled, if it blew up, if it caught fire \u2026 generally, we were involved in handling the forensic issues of that.\n\nOver a long career at NCIS, Michael Maloney investigated some of their highest-profile cases. He'd left NCIS and was teaching forensics when a student told him about the Stahlman case. He offered to take an initial look pro bono, but gave Kim a warning.\n\nMichael Maloney: Almost 100 percent of the time the death is exactly what it's reported to be.\n\nMaloney wanted better quality photos and thought authorities might have them. So, he helped Kim file another Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nKim Stahlman: There were almost 200 photos on that disc. If I hadn't asked for those, they woulda never volunteered 'em.\n\nMaloney says those photos led to a breakthrough.\n\nMichael Maloney: It changed the whole game.\n\nPoring over the new photos, Maloney reached a startling conclusion.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is a homicide \u2026 There was someone else in that room.\n\nHe believes an assailant probably fired two shots: one missed and the other went through Stahlman's head. He also believes the scene then could have been made to look like Stahlman had been alone and shot himself with his own gun.\n\nKim Stahlman: All I remember is him sayin', \"We've got a problem. This was staged.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: And when you heard those words?\n\nKim Stahlman: It was like, \"Oh, holy Jesus. I'm right.\"\n\nMaloney set up a simulation for \"48 Hours\" to help illustrate his theory: the trajectory of the bullet authorities recovered in the locker does not account for Col. Stahlman's injury.\n\n\"Why is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here?\" Michael Maloney asked, pointing to a diagram. \"They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury.\" CBS News\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to top of a graph]: Why is the trajectory of the bullet way up here and his injury is here? [pointing to bottom area of graph]. They should overlap each other. Because the bullet has to cause the injury.\n\nIn his theory, Maloney says the bullet hole in the wall likely came from the assailant's first shot -- a shot that Maloney believes missed Col. Stahlman. Evidence photo\n\nMaloney says the bullet hole in the wall, as seen in the investigator's photo, likely came from the assailant's first shot.\n\nMichael Maloney: For the first shot, he's going to fire and he's going to miss. That explains the hole in the wall.\n\nHe says what he sees around that hole is a telltale sign that the bullet never went through Stahlman's head.\n\nMichael Maloney: It has the appearance of gunshot residue.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All these little dots\n\nMichael Maloney: All those little dots --\n\nPeter Van Sant: This could be gunshot residue \u2013\n\nMichael Maloney: Burned \u2026 and unburned particles of gunpowder coming out of the muzzle of the weapon.\n\nMichael Maloney points to what he believe is gunshot residue in a photo taken by investigators CBS News\n\nIn his interpretation, those particles would be unlikely to have hit that area of the wall, if Col. Stahlman's head had been in the way of the bullet.\n\nMichael Maloney: This is when I began to believe that, perhaps, this wasn't the shot. This wasn't the fatal shot.\n\nThe fatal shot, says Maloney, would have been the second one.\n\nMichael Maloney: And as he [Stahlman] starts to move, the shooter is going to rock up as well and right in here, the shooter can fire as well.\n\nHe believes the bullet may have come to rest in the mattress, though that alleged second bullet has never been found. Maloney thinks he knows why.\n\nPeter Van Sant: All of this was destroyed, correct?\n\nMichael Maloney: All of this was burned as a biohazard, yes.\n\nMichael Maloney: Now let's look at that nightstand.\n\nThe bloody nightstand, says Maloney, supports his theory, too, because he says the stains only cover certain areas --\n\nMichael Maloney [pointing to evidence photo]: But we have none in this area or this area.\n\n-- leaving unstained sections called voids.\n\nMichael Maloney: There was something blocking the blood from hitting this surface of the nightstand.\n\nThat something, he says, could have been the assailant's body.\n\nMichael Maloney: Someone sitting on the nightstand, facing his bed.\n\nAnd Maloney says there's more evidence Stahlman may not have been alone. He says it looks to him like a woman could have been in the room.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well, there was a \u2026 tampon found on the floor.\n\nThere also was a dirty strip of fabric nearby.\n\nMichael Maloney: It \u2026 certainly would have the appearance of a sheer bathrobe tie or something like that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: There has been speculation that \u2026 Mike Stahlman perhaps had a girlfriend there.\n\nMichael Maloney: Well \u2026 what you propose is well within the realm of possibility.\n\nKim Stahlman [negates]: No. Uh-uh.\n\nPeter Van Sant: A one-night stand with someone?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. I would have known, I think.\n\nBut either way, Maloney says the strongest evidence supporting his theory of homicide is that sheet hanging over Stahlman's bed. It had blood on both sides. But, he says, what's most important is a particular type of stain called \"misting.\"\n\nMichael Maloney [looking at a photo of the bloody sheet ]: Look at this misting \u2026 The problem is, this on the outside of the sheet. \u2026 this tells me that this side of the sheet had to be facing or oriented towards his injuries at the time they occurred.\n\nHe says if the sheet was hanging down during the shooting, as it was found by first responders, the misting stains would have been on the inside. Maloney demonstrated for \"48 Hours.\"\n\nMichael Maloney: A lot of times when you are over there, you do drop a sheet \u2026 It blocks the light coming in from the windows. But, if you want to talk to someone, you can just pull the sheet back, and tuck it up.\n\nMaloney demonstrated by tucking the sheet into the springs of the overhead bunk.\n\nThe bloodstains at the scene, he says, strongly suggest the sheet was tucked up, out of the way, when the fatal shot was fired.\n\nMichael Maloney [demonstrating in simulation]: \u2026and it causes the bloodstain up here, the bloodstain pattern here, the misting stain, and the rest of the bloodstain from the exit wound goes down into the pillow and into the mattress.\n\nRemember, the mattress was destroyed.\n\nPeter Van Sant: How about the sheets and the blood?\n\nKim Stahlman: Burnt. Everything.\n\nKim Stahlman filed a lawsuit in 2013, alleging authorities conducted little or no investigation into various aspects of the scene.\n\nCilla McCain: They did not follow their own protocols, and that's why this has happened.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the case saying the court had no jurisdiction. So, Kim filed again with a military review board. Her lawyer says the board offered no assistance either.\n\nMichael Maloney: This required a thorough investigation. It didn't get one.\n\nMichael Maloney says he sent his 2011 report to his old employer, NCIS, and says they refused to meet with him about his findings. They declined to give \"48 Hours\" an on-camera interview.\n\nBut there is another side to this story.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Kim, it turns out that NCIS did do a forensic investigation \u2026 We have some clips \u2026 that we would like you to listen to.\n\nTWO EXPERTS, TWO CONCLUSIONS\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you believe that NCIS ever did a proper forensic examination of the shooting scene?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\n\"48 Hours\" submitted its own Freedom of Information Act request, and we discovered it's not quite that simple.\n\nMark Reynolds: My name is Dr. Mark Reynolds. I'm a forensic consultant and I investigated the, ah, death of Colonel Stahlman.\n\nDr. Mark Reynolds was brought on by NCIS in 2012 to review the case more than three years after the shooting, including Michael Maloney's report.\n\nNCIS gave the veteran homicide investigator and bloodstain pattern expert permission to speak with \"48 Hours.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: Did you have everything you needed?\n\nMark Reynolds: I -- the short answer is no. \u2026 I was quite critical of the response by NCIS in my report about the scene.\n\nReynolds told \"48 Hours\" he concurs with Michael Maloney that the shooting scene should have been handled differently.\n\nMark Reynolds: A better documentation of the scene and better exhibit collection would've been helpful \u2026 and it wasn't done.\n\nHe says that's partly because Col. Stahlman was still alive when he was found. So, first responders rightly were focused more on stabilizing him than preserving evidence. But Reynolds disagrees with Maloney on just about everything else.\n\nMark Reynolds: All the scene indicators that Mr. Maloney has raised -- are either equivocal or wrong.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Mike Maloney has a great reputation. \u2026 So, we're supposed to believe, in this particular case, the man doesn't know what he's talking about?\n\nMark Reynolds: In this particular case, believe the science. And the science is there.\n\nReynolds says Maloney based many of his conclusions on speculation. He says his own analysis of photos of the bloodstains, the nightstand, the sheet, the bullet hole and the trajectory, yielded no evidence anyone else was involved in Stahlman's death. Reynolds says the unstained area on the nightstand is too narrow to be meaningful.\n\nMark Reynolds [looking at a photo of the nightstand]: If Mr. Maloney is suggesting that that \u2026 might've been the leg of the attacker \u2026 it's three inches \u2026 That's a fairly thin leg.\n\nAnd what about that sheet hanging from the bunk above Stahlman's bed, the one that Michael Maloney claims has bloodstain misting on the wrong side?\n\nMark Reynolds: Transfer bloodstains look like spatter even under the microscope.\n\nReynolds says the bloodstains could have been transferred there by first responders.\n\nPeter Van Sant: In your opinion, there's nothing conclusive about this blood issue on the sheet?\n\nMark Reynolds: No.\n\nAnd he says the same is true of the gray spots near the bullet hole, which Maloney suspects are gunshot residue.\n\nMark Reynolds: It was never determined. There was no sampling ever done. To go from a grayish particulate matter on a wall \u2026 to extrapolate that as being gunshot residue I think is very dangerous leap. It could've been anything on that wall.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You don't even go to this potential two-shot scenario?\n\nMark Reynolds: There's no scientific evidence to say two shots were fired.\n\nDocuments indicate authorities did check the mattress for a bullet and didn't find one. And Mark Reynolds says Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. He says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds believes Michael Maloney made miscalculations in analyzing photos of the scene. Reynolds says when those errors are corrected, the path of the bullet that went through the wall does line up with Col. Stahlman's head wound.\n\nMark Reynolds [showing the diagram]: Did you get that?\n\nPeter Van Sant: That matches.\n\nMark Reynolds: That matches.\n\nBut what about the curious items on the floor? Like that piece of fabric that Maloney feels could have belonged to a woman?\n\nMark Reynolds: Pure speculation.\n\nAnd that tampon?\n\nMark Reynolds: Many soldiers around the world carry tampons in case they get shot because they put the tampon in the bullet hole and it stems the flow of blood.\n\nReynold's conclusion?\n\nMark Reynolds: There is no obvious scientific evidence to indicate that it was a homicide.\n\n\"48 Hours\" informed Michael Maloney about Mark Reynolds' findings. Maloney insists Reynolds is wrong.\n\nMichael Maloney: I stand by my assertion that the best explanation given the evidence that I've examined, does not indicate suicide.\n\nTwo experts, two very different conclusions.\n\nA look at the evidence: Two experts disagree on how Col. Michael Stahlman died\n\nPeter Van Sant: Have you ever heard of a man by the name of Mark Reynolds?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Never?\n\nKim Stahlman: No.\n\n\"48 Hours\" wanted to see what Kim Stahlman thought of Mark Reynolds' findings.\n\nPeter Van Sant [with Kim]: We have some clips from the interview that we did with Mark Reynolds that we would like you to listen to.\n\n\"48 Hours\" showed Kim Van Sant's interviews with Reynolds on an iPad:\n\nPETER VAN SANT [looking at a photo of Col. Stahlman's bunk]: Mike Maloney says at best, this is an ambiguous death scene. MARK REYNOLDS: My interpretation of this is there's strong contextual and scientific support for it being self-inflicted. There is no contextual or scientific support in my opinion for it being a homicide.\n\nPETER VAN SANT: And the fact that it's on the outside of the sheet, when the shooting occurred on the inside ... is an indication that someone pulled the sheet down. MARK REYNOLDS: I think he doesn't understand how difficult it is to classify bloodstains on fabrics.\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Stahlman [reacting to the video]: Yeah, I mean, I guess he's got his opinion. I don't know what to say.\n\nKim says she brought the case to other experts who supported Maloney's findings, and she still stands by Maloney.\n\nKim Stahlman: I know that Maloney broke down the room pixel by pixel -- that's all I know.\n\nAnd Kim is furious. She says authorities should have showed her the Reynolds report years ago.\n\nKim Stahlman [emotional]: Why didn't they show me that? Or tell me so that I could at least know. I don't understand why NCIS did not bring that to my attention, ever.\n\nKim says she has never felt authorities have respected her. In fact, in 2012, she says she discovered an email showing someone at NCIS appears to have blamed her for her husband's death.\n\nPeter Van Sant [reading the email]: \"It was a tragic suicide contributed by the pressures he was under to include stress piled on by his wife, who now believes/pretends it was a storybook marriage \u2026\"\n\nKim Stahlman: I never said it was a storybook marriage. Never. \u2026 I have said it was a marriage with ups and downs.\n\nAs \"48 Hours\" discovered in his emails, Col. Michael Stahlman may have been battling an enemy within.\n\nWHAT IS THE TRUTH?\n\nKim Stahlman has always accused NCIS of not conducting a thorough investigation.\n\nKim Stahlman: I think \u2026 they thought they could get away with their mistakes.\n\nBut NCIS documents suggest otherwise -- that evidence was collected, people were questioned, and many of Kim's concerns were answered.\n\nThey also provided her with all those photos and thousands of documents, many of which were passed on to \"48 Hours.\" Among them, emails between Kim and Mike in the final months of his life. Some are loving and upbeat. But there are others that raise troubling questions about Mike and the marriage, like one from Kim sent about two weeks before the shooting:\n\n\"I just can't keep putting myself on a guilt trip anymore and blame myself for our problems.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: What problems are you talking about in this?\n\nKim Stahlman: We had gotten to the point where we really didn't communicate. \u2026 and so we were talking about seeing a counselor for that.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You went on to say, \"after that, I can't make any promises because at this point, I feel it is about life and death for me. I can't stay in an unhealthy relationship.\"\n\nKim Stahlman: Right.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Here's the next quote: \"I know I've done some terrible, hurtful things to you and vica versa.\" \u2026 What's the terrible thing?\"\n\nKim Stahlman: Well to me -- I can't think of a specific thing, but ...\n\nPeter Van Sant: It sounds like your relationship is almost at the end of the line here.\n\nKim Stahlman: I'm a bit of a drama queen. \u2026 But it didn't -- that's not where it ended. And it doesn't show the conversations we had on the phone.\n\nIt's that last email Mike Stahlman apparently wrote to his wife not long before the shooting that strikes some as the strongest proof of suicide.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is this in your opinion a suicide note?\n\nStuart Bowen: No. Clearly not.\n\nStuart Bowen may be Kim Stahlman's best hope of getting authorities to listen. Bowen was the George W. Bush administration's Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. Kim first contacted him in 2011. He says he reviewed her legal filings and Michael Maloney's report and discussed the report with Maloney extensively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: What have you concluded?\n\nStuart Bowen: It was not a suicide. I believe that he was murdered.\n\nBowen says authorities may have cut corners early on.\n\nStuart Bowen: It might be the case that the rush to judgment \u2026 led to practices that departed from best practices.\n\nThough in 2017 Bowen resigned from a government job in Texas amid unrelated ethics allegations which he denies, he has become one of Kim's most important supporters.\n\nStuart Bowen: She's committed to the truth about what happened.\n\nBowen and Kim have helped Cilla McCain and others push Congress for a bill of rights for bereaved families. McCain says many have nowhere else to turn.\n\nKim Stahman and supporters for a bill of rights for bereaved families take on Capitol Hill CBS News\n\nCilla McCain: There's no court in which they can say, \"Hey \u2026 let's hear this fairly with unbiased eyes and ears.\" It doesn't exist for military families.\n\nRecently, another significant step forward. Bowen says he convinced the military's new chief medical examiner to take another look at the official findings in the case.\n\nStuart Bowen: He assured me that he's going to review it closely and discuss it widely.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Is that a big deal?\n\nKim Stahlman: Oh, God. Yeah.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Because what can that medical examiner do?\n\nKim Stahlman: Change \u2026 the death certificate.\n\nAfter spending about 10 years looking into this case, Cilla McCain is writing a book about it with Kim.\n\nCilla McCain: I have pored over thousands -- thousands of documents. I have talked to anybody that I could find.\n\nMcCain says in her experience, authorities rarely change their findings. And last summer, NCIS sent \"48 Hours\" a statement saying:\n\n\"NCIS has thoroughly investigated this case and we continue to stand by our investigative findings.\"\n\nNCIS's independent expert Mark Reynolds insists the science strongly suggests how Col. Stahlman sustained his fatal wound. But Reynolds also surprised \"48 Hours.\"\n\nPeter Van Sant: Do you feel 100-percent certain that this is a suicide?\n\nMark Reynolds: No. I think that -- if it was a hidden ... homicide, it was sophisticated and ... it won't be determined forensically. It'll be determined investigatively.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Would you be professionally troubled \u2026 if this this case was changed to undetermined?\n\nMark Reynolds: Would I be professionally troubled? No.\n\nPeter Van Sant: Can you live with undetermined?\n\nKim Stahlman: That's like saying, \"Eh, it can be this, it can be that.\" No. I may have to live with it, however I don't want to. I don't think it's fair to my children.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You've been described as a woman in denial about all of this.\n\nKim Stahlman [affirms]: Mm-hmm.\n\nPeter Van Sant: You're not in denial?\n\nKim Stahlman: No. No.\n\nFar from it, she insists.\n\nKim Stahlman: It would have been easier for me if it had been a suicide. At least I could move on with my freakin' life.\n\nKim recently visited her husband's grave at Arlington National Cemetery. She's now thinking of moving his remains closer to home.\n\nKim Stahlman: A man gave his entire life to his country, and for what? They didn't support him in the end.\n\nAs for the man they loved, Col. Stahlman's family knows they may never prove how he died, but they will always be proud of how he lived.\n\n\"It's my duty to carry on his legacy,\" MacKenna Stahlman, now 21, said. \"My father \u2026 was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet.\" Kim Stahlman\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: It's my duty to carry on his legacy and do great things so he'll be proud of me in whatever I end up doing in my life. ... My father \u2026 was probably the best man that I have ever met and might ever will meet.\n\nHe's a man she still sometimes meets when she closes her eyes at night.\n\nMacKenna Stahlman: \u2026 all of a sudden there's like, a knock on the door, and the door opens and it's Dad. \u2026 And then \u2026 I wake up and I'm, like, \"Nope, that was just a dream.\"\n\nKim Stahlman: There's no other man I've ever loved...\n\nKim Stahlman: I know I'll never meet another Mike Stahlman.", "description": "A Marine colonel is fatally wounded in Iraq; authorities say it was a suicide, but his wife says it was murder and she is determined to prove it", "authors": ["Peter Van Sant"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/27/b6c85c74-c4b1-4fed-9575-091c28346df1/thumbnail/1200x630/6e6ed550237a6dfb44e8707f6b878a72/michael-stahlman-hero.jpg"}
