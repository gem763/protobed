Now it's back with the second iteration, the Light Phone 2.\n\nThe original Light Phone could only make and receive phone calls, but the second version has some additional features: alarms and texting.\n\n\"Five years ago when we started, people didn't understand. 'Why are you creating a simple phone? What's the point?'\" Kai Tang, a Light cofounder, told Business Insider. \"Especially last year, we can sense the tide changed.\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nIn 2019, we are simultaneously more attached to our smartphones than ever before and more aware of how attached we are to our smartphones.\n\nFor many of us, it's become something of an anxiety-inducing loop: Open Instagram or Twitter or Reddit, get sucked in, realize how long we've been on said app, put the phone down, get a notification, repeat.\n\nThat loop is what the creators of the Light Phone 2 are hoping to eliminate.\n\nThe Light Phone 2, which debuts on Wednesday and costs $350, is the successor to Light's original device from 2017. It's sort of like the anti-smartphone, or maybe a Swiss Army knife: It's a tool, rather than a tool for distraction. It does only a few things (calls, texts, alarms) and has zero apps \u2014 no email, no social media, no music or video streaming, nothing.\n\nHere's how Light got its inspiration for the Light Phone, and what the company's latest \"dumb phone\" can do.", "description": "The Light Phone 2 is the successor to Light's original device from 2017.
