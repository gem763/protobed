But many suspect its primary target is something else: the euro.\n\nThe central bank is expected to cut interest rates and revive a bond-buying program at President Mario Draghi \u2019s penultimate meeting. And while the ECB doesn\u2019t target specific levels for the euro, the exchange rate has become a policy focus because of fears that currency strength squashes inflation.\n\n\u201cThis [focus on the euro] is more true than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors . PFG 0.05% \u201cInterest rates are so low that any further cut is not going to have much of an impact and runs the risk of making things worse. So why bother? Simply to target the euro.\u201d\n\nBut if that is the aim, success could come at a price. Further weakening of the euro, which has been falling against the dollar for almost 18 months, risks enraging President Trump and harming trade relations. In June, when Mr. Draghi raised hopes of a new round of easy-money policies, Mr. Trump tweeted that a weaker euro was \u201cmaking it unfairly easier\u201d for Europe to compete with the U.S.\n\nThe central bank needs to do something because inflation is low and falling: the latest reading in July was just 1%, half the ECB\u2019s target level. But several board members have questioned the need for more bond buying, or quantitative easing, ahead of the meeting. Politically in Europe, cutting rates is easier, even though they are already at minus 0.4%.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you see a weak euro impacting the U.S.? Join the conversation below.\n\nA rate cut \u201copens the door for Trump to come and accuse the ECB of actively weakening the currency,\u201d said Daniel Tenengauzer, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon in New York. If Europe\u2019s problem is \u201can external demand shock from China, then the exchange rate isn\u2019t going to help.\u201d\n\nFor the ECB, rate cuts are the tool of choice for influencing the exchange rate, as Mr. Draghi laid out in another major speech in Amsterdam in 2014.\n\nBut some think this policy has stopped making sense. The euro has fallen this year even as inflation has tumbled, undermining the importance of their connection. On a trade-weighted basis, in which the Chinese yuan and the British pound are important alongside the dollar, the euro is also weaker than it was at the start of the year, although it has gained ground in recent months.\n\nThe link between the euro and inflation has weakened, according to some observers, because more European trade is invoiced in euros and it is mainly only oil or other energy imports that are priced in dollars.\n\nMeanwhile, cutting rates could hurt the economy if it prompts the White House to, for instance, make good on threats to impose tariffs on European car makers. A bad reaction from Mr. Trump is more likely, with a cut at the higher end of analyst expectations: 0.2 percentage point, or 20 basis points.\n\n\u201cIf it goes for a 20-basis-point cut, it will be perceived as a currency devaluation by the United States and hurt the EU-U.S. trade negotiations badly,\u201d said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.\n\nThere are other problems, too. Negative rates hurt bank profits and at some point will push lenders to charge more for loans, the exact opposite of what low rates are meant to achieve. The ECB will try to make things less painful for banks by exempting them from some of the costs, but this isn\u2019t straightforward.\n\nThe ECB\u2019s own chief economist, Philip R. Lane, pointed out in a speech last week that negative rates have made a smaller contribution than other policy tools in managing inflation since 2016.\n\nTargeting the euro might also be fighting a losing battle\u2014and a policy mistake. Mr. Tenengauzer doesn\u2019t think the euro is going to weaken to the point where one euro buys one dollar.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi, pictured June 12.
