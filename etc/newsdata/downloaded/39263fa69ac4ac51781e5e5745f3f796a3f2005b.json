Here's how they can prove it.", "language": "en", "text": "Democratic presidential candidates have promised to help American workers and have walked the picket lines with striking UAW workers.\n\nBut during discussions about how to help workers during Tuesday's Democratic debate, the candidates failed to bring up crucial labor issues.\n\nIf Democratic candidates are serious about boosting American labor, they should support three changes.\n\nMike Elk is a labor reporter and founder of the crowdfunded labor publication Payday Report.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen some of the media attention on the month-long standoff between General Motors and the United Auto Workers petered out, one group of national figures helped keep some focus on tentatively concluded strike: the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nMany of them walked the picket line with the more than 40,000 striking workers at GM and used their vast social-media followings to draw attention to the UAW's strike.\n\nBut despite the candidates' appearances, the ways to immediately address the needs of similar workers got little time during Tuesday's debate. The moderators hardly focused on the strike and labor issues, despite the debate taking place in Ohio \u2014 home to one of the plants at the center of the UAW strike.\n\nAnd while several ideas to help workers were raised by the candidates, the discussion missed several key issues that the candidates should support if they want to prove their support for union workers is more than just talk.\n\nWhat the candidates got right about protecting workers\n\nWhile the candidates failed to address a few key topics, there were some labor issues that the 2020 hopefuls were right to shine a light on.\n\nFor instance, Sen. Cory Booker, the grandson of a UAW leader, said he would push to allow for sectoral bargaining, a tactic that would allow workers across companies to bargain for better standards in their industry.\n\nFormer Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke also touched on the need to use trade deals to push other countries to strengthen workers' rights. O'Rourke said that under current Mexican labor, workers \"are effectively unable\" to unionize today. \"Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker,\" he said, \"but it puts the American worker at a disadvantage.\"\n\nBy pushing for stronger labor standards in trade deals, US presidents can not only help foreign workers but American workers as well.\n\nIncentivize companies to make next generation cars in the US\n\nWhile the debate touched on some labor issues, there were a few major changes that the Democratic candidates should have talked about as well. A major change is the need to encourage manufacturers to keep jobs in the US.\n\nAs recently as 1995, GM was the largest employer in Ohio, employing 63,000 auto workers across the state.\n\nNow, 24 years later, GM is the 72nd-largest employer in Ohio, employing 4,600 workers.\n\nIn November 2018, more than 1,700 autoworkers were laid off when GM idled its Lordstown, Ohio, plant. The closure became a focus of the UAW strike, with workers demanding that GM reopen both the Lordstown plant and GM's Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly as electric-truck plants.\n\nIncreasingly, as GM shifts to electric cars, it's shifting its production overseas to China, where government investments for green-car production are significantly higher than in the US. By far, the most contentious issue of the strike has been the UAW demand that those cars are produced in the US.\n\n\"We want to make those cars, and we want to make them right here in the US,\" said Al Tiller, chairman of UAW Local 1005 in Parma, Ohio.\n\nMany workers say that US presidents should support investments in electric-car manufacturing as part of any Green New Deal to ensure that those products are made here in the US.\n\n\"The American dream is vanishing, and it's time that someone finally stands up for us,\" Tiller added.\n\nSupport true 'Medicare for All'\n\nThroughout the debate, candidates debated \"Medicare for All,\" but not one of them presented a case for how it could help unions such as the UAW.\n\n\"We believe that [Medicare for All] would take costs off the back of employers and should make us more competitive,\" says UAW Local 1097 Dan Maloney of Rochester, New York, citing the decision of GM to build the Chevy Camaro in Canada \u2014 a country with a universal healthcare system \u2014 because they could save $1,800 per car in healthcare costs.\n\nSeveral moderate Democratic presidential candidates have argued against Medicare for All, saying that union members have fought for their health-insurance plans and should be able to keep them.\n\n\"You've broken your neck to get [your healthcare plan],\" Joe Biden said at a Philadelphia AFL-CIO Forum last month. \"You've given up wages to get it. You should be entitled to keep it. And no plan should take it away from you if that's what you decide.\"\n\nBut Biden's proclamation highlights the exact problem with union-negotiated healthcare: Workers are forced to give up wage increases to keep employers from increasing their healthcare costs.\n\nAs part of their negotiations with the UAW, GM threatened to increase the share of healthcare premiums paid by union members, from 3% to 15%. GM has since withdrawn its proposal to increase healthcare premiums, but only after the UAW offered concessions in exchange for keeping healthcare costs lower.\n\nWorse, GM attempted to scare many UAW workers by cutting off their healthcare coverage for going on strike. GM reversed course after public pressure, but the threat is a widely used tactic used by many employers attempting to play hardball with unions during contract talks.\n\nUnder a Medicare for All system, the threat to cut off healthcare couldn't be dangled over striking workers heads, and their leaders could instead fight for gains in areas like wages without having to make concessions to keep health costs low.\n\nExtend unemployment benefits to striking workers\n\nThe biggest thing that dissuades workers from striking is their inability to pay their bills while out on the picket line. Currently, workers in only three states \u2014 Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey \u2014 are eligible for unemployment benefits when they are on strike.\n\nIn New York, where more than 3,400 GM workers are on strike, workers can receive unemployment benefits only after they've been on strike for seven weeks.\n\nWhile presidential candidates have presented ideas on broader labor law reforms, no candidate so far has focused publicly on the urgent need to grant unemployment benefits to striking workers.\n\nAdvocates say that giving workers' unemployment benefits is a key tool to level the playing field between workers and employers.\n\n\"Workers who are out of work should have access to earned [unemployment] benefits,\" National Employment Law Project policy analyst Michelle Evermore says, adding that workers pay into unemployment insurance throughout their careers.\n\n\"These are not lavish benefits that encourage workers to go on strike \u2014 they are merely a lifeline that means that families out of work trying to negotiate a better contract at work will be slightly more likely to remain afloat.\"\n\nPresidential candidates walked the picket line. Will they back it up?\n\nWhile campaigning for president, Barack Obama promised at a rally in South Carolina in November 2007 that \"if American workers are being denied their right to organize and collectively bargain, when I'm in the White House, I'll put on a comfortable pair of shoes myself. I'll walk on that picket line with you as president of the United States of America. Because workers deserve to know that someone's standing in their corner.\"\n\nObama, though, never fulfilled that promise as president, famously failing to heed union's call for him to march on the Wisconsin State Capitol when former Gov. Scott Walker stripped public employees of collective-bargaining rights.\n\nRecently, many autoworkers have grown frustrated with President Donald Trump, who, despite promising to fight for workers during his 2016 run, has remained mostly quiet about the UAW-GM strike.\n\nWhile nearly all the Democratic candidates have proved more than willing to appear at picket lines during their campaigns, it remains to be seen if they will follow through on their promises to fight for workers.\n\nUnion workers have so far seen the support of the Democratic candidates, but the real question remains: Who's truly on workers' side, versus merely looking for a photo op?\n\nA Sidney-award winning labor reporter, Mike Elk is founder of the crowdfunded labor publication Payday Report.
