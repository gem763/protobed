(Never mind that in the chaos of the rushed withdrawal, American troops were shot at by Turkish-aligned militias, left camps in the hands of marauding Russians, and were forced to bomb munitions dumps to prevent their capture.) But today brings news that Trump now wants to leave 200 members of the military in Syria.\n\nHe allowed an invasion, then fumed when it happened. He said he was bringing the troops home, then said he\u2019d leave them in place.\n\nThe flip-flops aren\u2019t just in matters of foreign policy, and the G7 reversal wasn\u2019t even the only U-turn to emerge from Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing Thursday. Asked whether the United States had demanded a quid pro quo from the Ukrainian government\u2014investigate a phantom conspiracy theory about the 2016 election in exchange for American aid\u2014Mulvaney said it sure had. \u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d he said. Within hours, Mulvaney had issued a statement denying that he\u2019d said what he\u2019d said.\n\nRead: Trump almost always folds\n\nJames Hohmann argues these cases show that conservatives have more leverage over the president than they seem to believe. But it isn\u2019t obvious why Trump is going wobbly now. Yes, Trump needs Republican support, especially with impeachment looking ever more likely. But his first major move after Democrats veered toward impeachment was the Syria withdrawal, which of course antagonized Republicans in Congress. His reversal only brings him back to even at best.\n\nTrump\u2019s equivocations are rich for a president whose selling point has always been that, like it or not, he tells it like it is. \u201cI will present the facts plainly and honestly,\u201d Trump promised at the 2016 Republican National Convention. More often these days, he\u2019s telling it like it ain\u2019t. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening,\u201d he told an audience recently. It\u2019s an apt disclaimer for any statement from the White House.", "description": "A president who has long ignored criticism is suddenly giving in, reversing course on the G7 summit and withdrawal from Syria.", "authors": ["David A.
