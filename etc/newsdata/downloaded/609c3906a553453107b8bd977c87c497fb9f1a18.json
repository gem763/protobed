He\u2019s followed by Elizabeth Warren at 22 percent \u2014 that\u2019s up 6 points and a new high for her. Bernie Sanders is at 17 percent, down 1 point since last month.\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s support has stayed between 29-35 percent since March, his current 10-point advantage is about half of his 19-point lead in June\u2026\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s allegations about improper actions by Biden and his son have so far failed to chip away at Biden\u2019s support in the primary race \u2014 and Democratic primary voters continue to believe the former vice president is the candidate best equipped to beat Trump in 2020: 43 percent feel that way, up from 42 percent last month. Nineteen percent think Warren has the best chance to oust Trump and 15 percent say Sanders\u2026\n\nThe poll, released Thursday, shows Biden (50-40 percent) and Warren (50-40 percent) both top Trump by 10 points, and Sanders is up by 9 (49-40 percent). This marks the first time all three Democrats have held a lead outside the poll\u2019s margin of error. Last month, Biden was up by 14 points, Warren by 6 and Sanders by 8.", "description": "", "authors": ["Fox News", "Foxnews.Com Politics Fox-News-Poll-Biden-And-Warren-Gain-Ground-In-Democratic-Race"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
