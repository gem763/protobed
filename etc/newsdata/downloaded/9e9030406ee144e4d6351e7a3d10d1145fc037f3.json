Would you whip out your credit card and rush to book yourself an appointment? Or would you silently mark me down as yet another decadent, middle-aged, straw-clutching desperado who feels bad about her complexion?\n\nTo be clear, I don\u2019t feel bad about my neck \u2013 not yet. But perhaps I am a middle-aged desperado all the same, for how else to explain my appearance at the Light Salon, a clinic that offers the very treatment I\u2019ve just described? The child of scientists, I\u2019m a natural sceptic when it comes to the claims of the multi-billion-pound beauty industry. I still wash my face, just as I\u2019ve always done, with soap and water. I would no more spend a lot of money on moisturiser, Botox or anything else in that vein than I would run down the street in my underwear. Even if I didn\u2019t have strongly feminist feelings about facelifts, I would still find them alarming both in theory and in practice. Yet here I am, hoping that I will shortly look a little rosier: a better version of myself, if not precisely a younger looking one.\n\nIt is all so easy, that\u2019s the thing. This branch of the Light Salon is in Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge. You can walk in off the street and because the procedure is non-invasive and has no side effects \u2013 no redness, no irritation \u2013 when you stroll out again you need not worry about terrifying everyone you encounter. I could turn up for a meeting and no one would be any the wiser. From start to finish, moreover, the whole thing takes only 20 minutes (the extra time is devoted to cleansing your skin before the treatment begins and moisturising it afterwards); I\u2019ve waited in the queue at Caff\u00e8 Nero for longer. Best of all, it is appealingly de-stressing: an enforced break in a busy day. Tiny goggles in place to protect your eyes, you\u2019ve no choice but to close them and give in to the unseasonal warmth that will soon spread gently across your face. It\u2019s like lying on the beach, save for the fact that you are fully dressed and, somewhere far in the background, you can hear the distant howl of a police siren.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shine on: a patient lies under LEDs as part of his photodynamic therapy for skin cancer.

The Light Salon has various machines available, but in my case the aesthetician, Amy Fiddler, will set me up beneath the Healite, a unit developed by Dr Glen Calderhead, the man who is generally considered to be one of the godfathers of low-level light therapy (LLLT). The Healite uses light-emitting diode (LED) technology, delivered at a wavelength of 830nm, to promote cellular function. LEDs may be blue, red, or yellow. Blue lights are used to treat acne, killing the bacteria that are its cause and regulating excess oil. Red lights stimulate collagen and elastin, the two holy grails of anti-ageing. Yellow lights help with wound healing and rejuvenation, and temporarily increase blood circulation. This machine uses a combination of red and yellow lights, arranged on a unit some 15 to 20cm away from my face, and though the results are incremental \u2013 a full course of 13 treatments (yours for \u00a3350) is recommended to achieve lasting effects \u2013 I\u2019m told that I am likely, nevertheless, to see an improvement in my skin in the next 24 hours. And so, I sit back and relax\u2026\n\nIts uses are not limited to skincare. It works for pain relief as well\n\nOn the line from Seoul, South Korea, Calderhead is telling me the story of the development of LED therapy and of how he first came to be involved with it. According to Calderhead, who trained in the UK as a pathologist and who maintains a healthy Scottish accent, phototherapy has two true godfathers. The first of these is Endre Mester, a Hungarian medic who, in the late 1960s, began experimenting with the effects of lasers on skin cancer. \u201cHe published a paper in which he revealed that he had successfully cured the leg ulcers of patients using a red light laser,\u201d says Calderhead. The second is Professor Harry Whelan, a neurologist who, in the late 1980s, was working at Nasa\u2019s medicine laboratory. Having developed a blue light to be used to activate chlorophyll on the space station\u2019s hydroponic plant farms, he began to examine possible medical uses for the diodes. He then developed a red LED that operated at 633nm, and subsequently published a paper looking at its effect on pain attenuation and wound healing. Could Calderhead be described as a third godfather? \u201cI\u2019m not sure about that,\u201d he says, laughing.\n\nIn 1976, Calderhead went to Japan to study on a six-month sabbatical and there he met Dr Toshio Ohshiro, an \u201coutstanding\u201d laser surgeon. \u201cI was fascinated by his work to the extent that, after two weeks, he suggested I stay and study with him,\u201d says Calderhead. \u201cIn the course of one laser treatment, to remove a birthmark on a woman\u2019s sternum, he found he\u2019d incidentally cured her post-herpetic neuralgia [a painful complication of shingles that affects the nerves]. Post-herpetic neuralgia lives in the intercostal muscles. We thought about this and we surmised that some of the light energy had penetrated beyond its target at a very, very low level \u2013 and this, of course, tied in with the findings of laser surgeons like Mester.\u201d Ohshiro and Calderhead were duly encouraged to branch out, from laser surgery into laser therapy. \u201cWe played around with wavelengths and LEDs, and in 1988 we published the first book on LLLT.\u201d\n\nIn 2002, Calderhead met the CEO of a company called Phototherapeutics, the manufacturer of an LED system named Omnilux. Soon afterwards, he became its clinical director. At this point, Omnilux was working on two heads: red and blue. Patients treated with red light for non-melanoma skin cancers on their faces reported that afterwards their skin was in much better condition generally. The blue had proved effective in treating acne, but only for a limited period. \u201cMy first job was to work out why eruptions happened again, and why the light also turned the skin darker,\u201d he says. This led him to use both lights together (previously they had been used separately). He also changed the frequency of the wavelength from 415nm to 830nm. This new, combined head was effective for both healing and rejuvenation: 830nm was, he says, \u201cthe magic number\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Low light \u2018godfather\u2019: Dr Glen Calderhead\n\nCalderhead now works at Lutronic, the Seoul-based manufacturer of the Healite. So how does LED therapy work? \u201cLLLT is an exchange of photon energy. Each photon is a packet of pure energy without mass. The energy passes into the energy pool of the cell. If it has a job to do, it will do it better. The part of the dermis that makes collagen, for instance, will make better collagen faster. It produces a viable clinical effect with no damage.\u201d Its uses are not limited to skincare. \u201cIn Australia, where clinics are taking it up, it has been found to be fantastic for burns.\u201d Does Calderhead use it himself? \u201cYes. For pain relief. I have sciatic neuralgia in my left hip \u2013 an old rugby injury. I put myself under the Healite twice a week. If I miss this, I\u2019m in agony.\u201d\n\nSome see it not as a backlash against Botox, but close to it\n\nCalderhead believes the future for LED therapy is, well, extremely bright \u2013 though hospitals in the west remain reluctant to invest in it. \u201cThey have shied away because it is so associated with aesthetics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can chip away at this reluctance, by making it easier to understand.\u201d He believes LED therapy could, in the future, be deployed far more widely. \u201cAnything that involves wound healing and pain attenuation. It will work on the muscular-skeletal system. It will work on nerve injury. Recently, it has been used in cerebral trauma, such as stroke. This is why I call one of my presentations \u2018Join the Healing Revolution\u2019.\u201d What about side effects? Are there any? \u201cNo, no. People always ask. For 830, there are really none. For 633, you have to be careful what else is on the skin \u2013 for instance, perfume \u2013 because you can get a photosensitive reaction.\u201d\n\nIn the beauty world, the popularity of LED therapy is growing exponentially. In part, this is due simply to its increasing availability. According to Louise Taylor, one of the founders of Dermalux, a Warrington-based manufacturer of LED systems, some 1,000 clinics in the UK now use her company\u2019s devices. \u201cThere is a feeling in the market that LED is something you can have on an ongoing basis,\u201d she says. \u201cUnless you have issues of photosensitivity, there are no real limits as to how much of it you can have, and that\u2019s one reason why it is expanding in clinics.\u201d But it is also the result of word of mouth, particularly on social media.\n\nWhen home-use LED light masks came on to the market they became an Instagram trend, Lena Dunham among those who posed wearing one (hers was by Neutrogena, and cost only \u00a327.50; however, last July this product was withdrawn from sale in the US following \u201creports of visual effects\u201d by users). More recently, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung have posted pictures of themselves wearing home-use masks (the effect is spooky: sort of Hannibal Lecter meets the Cybermen, with added colour).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Facing facts: a group tries the Neutrogena mask, which was later withdrawn from sale. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nSome see it, too, as a cultural shift: not a backlash against Botox exactly, but something close to it. \u201cI think there is that movement, yes,\u201d says Dr Dennis Gross, the American dermatologist and skin-care guru whose home LED mask retails for \u00a3430. \u201cI think people want prevention right now, and that is one positive benefit of LED. Botox doesn\u2019t stimulate collagen. LED gets to the heart of that matter: you will have more collagen, and it stays there \u2013 it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s one of the most efficacious treatments in dermatology.\u201d His patients love the fact that it requires no down time \u2013 no recovery period \u2013 and that if they own a mask, they can, as is not the case with Botox, have treatments at home. (Do the masks work? Calderhead says they will never be as good as a clinical-style system; the lights are too close to the skin to be fully efficient.)\n\nHannah Measures, one of the co-founders of the Light Salon \u2013 which will shortly launch a new LED \u201cbib\u201d to enable clients to treat their d\u00e9colletage \u2013 agrees that clients are increasingly interested in a more gentle, more holistic approach to their skin. \u201cThere is a growing body of people who think: we can\u2019t stop ourselves getting older and we don\u2019t really mind wrinkles, but still, we want to be the best possible version of ourselves.\u201d LED therapy, she says, connects to \u201cwellbeing\u201d as much as it does to anti-ageing. \u201cOur new bib can be placed on the shoulder and, in trials, some patients have said it helps with pain relief,\u201d she says. Hence her determination to keep prices at her business fairly affordable: \u201cIt\u2019s so important to us that this is democratic.\u201d\n\nBy now, you may be wondering how I got on in this brave new nurturing world (though a single treatment is hardly a fair test). Well, the experience is rather lovely. I hate the winter and the warmth on my face is delicious. I like having to sit still, too: an enforced period of calm. Afterwards, I do glow a little (though we might attribute this to several things). But alas, I will also develop a somewhat teenage-looking spot the next morning. Am I tempted to sign up for a full course? Yes, but only after my conversation with Calderhead, LED\u2019s great evangelist. As he puts it: \u201cWe have proved that collagen and elastin are both improved by LLLT. But education is important. This won\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s non-invasive and has been proven to work. But can LED therapy really be a miracle cure for everything from acne to tired skin?
