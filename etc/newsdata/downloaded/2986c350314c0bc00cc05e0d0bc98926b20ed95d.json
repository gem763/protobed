American Airlines flights to Camaguey, Holguin and Santa Clara, the beach resort of Varadero and the eastern city of Santiago are also being banned.\n\nA JetBlue flight departs for Cuba on August 31, 2016 from Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But the Trump administration announced it will end the Obama-era policy of flying to the island nation, except to Havana, starting in December\n\nAirport workers receive JetBlue flight 387, the first commercial flight between the U.S. and Cuba in more than a half century, holding a United States, and a Cuban national flag, on the airport tarmac in Santa Clara, Cuba in August 2016. The Trump administration is banning U.S. flights to all Cuban cities except Havana starting in December 2019\n\nThe first commercial flight between the United States and Cuba since 1961 lands in Santa Clara, Cuba on August 31, 2016. But there's been a freeze in the relations, as the State Department will only permit air travel to Havana\n\nFlights to Havana, which account for the great majority of U.S. flights to Cuba, will remain legal.\n\n'This action will prevent the Castro regime from profiting from U.S. air travel and using the revenues to repress the Cuban people,' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter.\n\nRaul Castro stepped down as president last year but remains head of the Communist Party, the country's highest authority.\n\nAnother stated reason for the move is to prevent tourism to Cuba, which is barred by U.S. law. But it is not clear how many people take the banned flights for tourism purposes. Many are used by Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in cities far from Havana by road.\n\n'Eager to punish Cuba's unbreakable defiance, imperialism is going after regular flights to various Cuban cities. It doesn't matter that they're affecting family relations, or the modest pocketbooks of most Cubans in both countries,' Carlos F. de Coss\u00edo, head of Cuba's department of U.S. affairs, said on Twitter. 'Our response isn't changing.'\n\nCharter flights to destinations outside Havana are apparently not affected by the ban, but those flights tend to be more expensive and far less convenient. The other remaining legal option is a flight to Havana and then a road trip that could last as much as eight to more than 12 hours over rutted, unsafe roads, in the case of Cuba's eastern cities.\n\nJetBlue and American issued brief statements saying they would comply with the decision.\n\nPresident Trump speaking on Friday. His administration is tightening restrictions with Cuba, ending flights to all cities except Havana\n\nA sign at Miami International Airport in December 2014, but starting in December, flights will only take off for Havana as the Cuban destination\n\nThe announcement coincided with an event in Miami calling for regime change in Cuba and featuring U.S. officials, Organization of Americans States President Luis Almagro, and a variety of Cuban-Americans and Cuban dissidents.\n\n'This is a step forward,' said Cuba-born barber Ernesto Regues, who said he left the island in 2012 and still has family in Havana. 'Now they need to stop the flights to Havana.'\n\nCarrie Filipetti, deputy assistant secretary for Cuba and Venezuela in the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Havana would serve as the gateway for Cuban-Americans wanting to see their relatives.\n\n'We want to make sure that Cuban-Americans do have a route to their families. You need to enter. Havana is currently carved out for this,' she said.\n\nShe warned, however, that 'we will continue to increase sanctions' and said other countries should do the same.\n\n'It is a long path with many steps along the way,' she said to a standing ovation.\n\nLourdes D\u00edaz, a retired Cuban-American who arrived in the U.S. one year after Castro's Revolution, said she disagrees with the current sanctions, feeling they help Cuba's communist government more than hurt it.\n\nPeople wait in line for a flight from Miami International Airport to Havana in December 2014. Many tourists will not have a hard time getting to most areas in Cuba, with a U.S. air travel ban later this year\n\nA private taxi driver on an old American car takes tourist customers through the streets of Havana on June 2019. The Cuban capital is the only city that the U.S. will permit flights\n\n'The only thing that suffers is the people,' Diaz said.\n\nThe Trump administration has been regularly tightening the six-decade-old embargo on Cuba in recent months with the stated purpose of cutting off income to the Cuban government and forcing it to cut ties to Venezuela and grant more human rights to Cuban citizens.\n\nWashington has barred cruise ships visiting Cuba and sanctioned oil tankers moving petroleum from Venezuela to Cuba.\n\nThe measures have contributed to the Cuban government's chronic shortages of hard currency and were blamed for several weeks of fuel shortages on the island, but so far there is no indication that the Trump policy is having its desired effect.\n\nCuba's security services continue to detain and harass dissenters and human rights groups say freedom of expression, assembly and other rights remain highly curtailed.\n\nThe Cuban and Venezuelan government remain tightly aligned and both have declared their intent to become even closer allies in the face of the Trump measures.", "description": "The Trump administration is halting U.S. flights to Cuba, other than Havana.
