Different types of the parasitoid wasps have in the past been found in the neighbouring Congo and Cameroon\n\nResearchers from the University of Turku, in Finland, made their discoveries by catching the creatures in tent-like traps.\n\nHigh definition pictures of the insects show they are orange or black in colour and the females have 'extremely' long ovipositors.\n\nOvipositors are pipes coming out of the rear end of the creature which are used to drill through wood, stab and paralyse other creatures, and lay eggs.\n\nThe Epirhyssa wasps use them to inject their eggs into the larvae of beetles or other wasps which live inside rotting wood.\n\nNot much is known about wasps of the rhyssine family, and the largest species have only been spotted twice before, the team said, in 1930 and in 1980.\n\nBut this time they have managed to find an entire community, among them the two new species which had never been seen before.\n\nThe insects can grow up to four inches (10cm) long but do not have stings so cannot hurt humans. Their offspring, however, are parasitoids and eat their insect hosts from the inside out\n\nResearchers discovered the wasps by catching them in tent-like traps \u2013 bugs which fly into the fabric travel upwards in a bid to get out until they get stuck in a bottle at the highest point\n\nThe second new species discovered, the Epirhyssa johanna, was named after the wife of one of the scientists \u2013 Johanna\n\nPhD student Tapani Hopkins, who found the insects, said: 'A good example of how poorly tropical rhyssines are known is the species Epirhyssa overlaeti, which is the largest African rhyssine.\n\n'Only two females were known before, one collected in the 1930s in the Congo and the other one in Cameroon in the 1980s.\n\n'Now, at one single Ugandan site, we found large numbers of both females and males. This completely changed what is known of the distribution of the species.'\n\nThe wasps, which are known as parasitoid wasps, breed by laying their eggs inside other insect larvae.\n\nWhile inside these larvae, the wasp infants eat their internal organs \u2013 the host will have been paralysed or poisoned by the mother wasp \u2013 until the host dies and the wasp larva emerges and becomes a pupa.\n\nIt then develops inside this cocoon before emerging as a fully fledged wasp reading to repeat the process.\n\nResearchers from University of Turku, in Finland, discovered the species and named them themselves\n\nMr Hopkins, who published his research in the journal ZooKeys, took full advantage of his naming privilege after discovering the insects.\n\nHe added: 'We named one of the new species Epirhyssa quagga, because its colouration resembles that of a zebra. [Zebras' scientific name is Equus quagga]\n\n'The other species became Epirhyssa johanna. The name Johanna refers to my wife.'", "description": "Researchers from University of Turku, in Finland, discovered the species Epirhyssa quagga and Epirhyssa johanna in the Kibale National Park in Uganda.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495366-0-image-a-27_1570631157570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
