They manage because their bodies have a slew of adaptations that make them extremely effective at extracting and using oxygen.\n\nRead: Life can survive on the most Mars-like place on Earth\n\nCompared to other geese, their lungs are larger, and their breaths are deeper and more efficient. Once oxygen enters their blood, it is bound by the same red pigment\u2014hemoglobin\u2014that other birds use, but their version grabs the gas far more tightly. The blood vessels in their muscles are more densely packed, allowing them to deliver oxygen more quickly. Even the cells in those muscles have special tweaks: The mitochondria\u2014small structures where energy is produced\u2014are more numerous and located closer to the surface, making it easier for oxygen to reach them. \u201cIt\u2019s not just one thing,\u201d says Meir. The geese \u201chave adaptations at every step of the way.\u201d\n\nThese tricks have been uncovered through decades of research, but almost always with bar-headed geese that were resting or walking on treadmills. Only one group of scientists studied the birds as they flew in a wind tunnel, and they used air with normal oxygen levels. Meir wanted to duplicate the low-oxygen conditions of a Himalayan crossing, and measure the performance of flying geese using instruments mounted on masks and backpacks. A wild-caught goose would never fly in a tunnel with such equipment. \u201cYou\u2019d just be studying a fear response,\u201d Meir says. The only solution was to raise some of the birds herself.\n\nCredit: Jessica Meir\n\nMeir found a bird park in North Carolina that houses bar-headed geese, and headed over before a dozen eggs were set to hatch. When the young goslings emerged, they immediately \u201cimprinted\u201d on Meir, psychologically categorizing her as their parent forevermore. She fed them, cared for them, and trained them to fly by riding a scooter down country roads while the birds flapped next to her. \u201cThey\u2019d fly so close that their wingtips would brush my arm,\u201d Meir says. \u201cAnd I\u2019d be looking into the face of this animal flying next to me, and not just any animal but my baby.\u201d\n\nOccasionally, an oncoming car would spook the birds, which would veer up and away. If they lost sight of Meir, they\u2019d alight in populated areas and chase anyone that could have conceivably been their mother. One landed in a hockey field and started running after the players. Another found a grocery store and followed people in and out of the automatic doors. \u201cI pulled the scooter over, grabbed the goose, and everyone was just like: What\u2019s going on?\u201d Meir says. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to write a children\u2019s book about this.\u201d\n\nFor several weeks, she cemented her bond with the goslings by taking them for walks, playing with them, and letting them pile on top of her for naps. \u201cI joked that as a woman in my 30s, I suddenly had these 12 babies following me around,\u201d she says. \u201cI was a modern-day Mother Goose. It was an exceptional experience.\u201d", "description": "To understand how bar-headed geese cross the Himalayas, astronaut Jessica Meir had to raise some herself.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/015_JM_flight_training_on_motor_scooter/facebook.jpg?1567599533", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
