Photo: Amy Sussman/Getty Images\n\nThe new Matrix movie has a fresh recruit. According to Variety, Neil Patrick Harris is joining the fourth installment of the franchise in a role that has not yet been disclosed, which makes a lot of sense considering the plot of the movie has not yet been disclosed, either. Matrix co-creator Lana Wachowski is writing and directing the film, with her original stars Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss reprising their iconic roles. The NPH announcement comes a week after news that Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who played the villainous Black Manta in last year\u2019s Aquaman, would also be coming onboard as one of the leads. New Matrix is expected to go into production in early 2020.", "description": "Neil Patrick Harris has been cast in the fourth Matrix film, from franchise co-creator Lana Wachowski, who will write and direct.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/15/15-neil-patrick-harris.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
