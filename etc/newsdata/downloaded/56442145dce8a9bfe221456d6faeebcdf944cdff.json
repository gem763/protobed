(AP) - The Georgia players know it\u2019s a big game. They can read the polls. They can hear all the chatter around campus.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re well-versed on Notre Dame\u2019s storied past.\n\nGeorge Gipp?\n\n\u201cUhh, no,\u201d tight end Eli Wolf conceded Monday.\n\nThe Four Horsemen?\n\n\u201cThat rings a little bit more of a bell,\u201d Wolf said, dropping his head and chuckling a bit but offering no further details.\n\nRudy?\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen \u2018Rudy,\u2019\u201d he shot back quickly, clearly proud of himself for knowing at least the Hollywood version of a revered chapter in Fighting Irish history. \u201cSome people say they cry at the end. I was never one to get too emotional, but it\u2019s a good movie.\u201d\n\nOf course, it won\u2019t be a history class they\u2019re taking Saturday night.\n\nIt\u2019s a football game that could have reverberations all the way to the College Football Playoff.\n\nNo. 3 Georgia (3-0) will host No. 7 Notre Dame (2-0) for the first time between the hedges (a.k.a. Dooley Field at Sanford Stadium), a showdown that has been eagerly anticipated in these parts pretty much since the series was announced five summers ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be electrifying in that stadium, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said former Georgia coach Vince Dooley, whose name was officially added to the massive facility less than two weeks ago.\n\nIt will be only the third meeting between these famed programs.\n\nThe first came at the 1981 Sugar Bowl, when a Georgia team coached by Dooley and starring Herschel Walker sealed what remains the school\u2019s only consensus national championship with a 17-10 victory over the Fighting Irish.\n\nFor Dooley, who grew up attending Catholic schools in Mobile, Alabama, and listening to Fighting Irish games on the radio, all while dreaming of playing in South Bend, the significance of beating the school of Knute Rockne and the Gipper only added to the celebration nearly four decades ago.\n\n\u201cThe main thing was playing for the national championship,\u201d the 87-year-old Dooley recalled Monday. \u201cWe would have been happy playing anybody. But especially Notre Dame.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, the teams met for the first time in South Bend. Under the gaze of Touchdown Jesus, the red-clad Georgia fans stormed into town by the thousands to cheer the Bulldogs to a 20-19 victory that signaled the beginning of their return to national prominence under coach Kirby Smart.\n\nGeorgia went on to capture the Southeastern Conference title and make it all the way to the national championship game, where the Bulldogs lost to Alabama in overtime.\n\nSmart refused to discuss Notre Dame through the first three weeks of the season, which proved to be little more than a run of glorified scrimmages. The Bulldogs romped past Vanderbilt, Murray State and Arkansas State by a cumulative score of 148-23.\n\nNow, finally, he\u2019s ready to talk about the Fighting Irish.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great game to have, a nonconference game you play at home and a school with such a tradition as Notre Dame,\u201d the fourth-year coach said. \u201cI know a lot of Georgia fans have had this one marked on the schedule for a long time. So have a lot of Notre Dame fans.\u201d\n\nGeorgia is even bringing in some extra seats, adding temporary aluminum bleachers accommodating 500 people in the west end zone plaza that will ensure a record crowd of more than 93,000.\n\nThey probably could\u2019ve sold another 100,000 tickets for this one, judging by the demand on the secondary market. As of Monday, the asking price on StubHub for the priciest set of lower-level tickets was $4,750; even the worst of the nosebleed seats, way up in the third level, were going for nearly $300 apiece.\n\nNotre Dame is used to being the biggest game every place it goes.\n\nCoach Brian Kelly said it won\u2019t be an issue to get ready for the frenzied setting in Athens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work on it during the week,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an indoor facility \u2026 we can make that as loud as we want it to be. It will be hot here, too. The weather will be warm. There won\u2019t be any excuses relative to acclimatizing to the weather conditions. We\u2019ll prepare them for all of those.\u201d\n\nWhile Smart knows the Georgia fans are especially pumped for this game, he\u2019s trying to pass on the same sense of urgent normalcy he has every week.\n\n\u201cAs far as the stage, the biggest thing you can do is let your players relax and play,\u201d he said. \u201cThe team that over-analyzes it and hypes it up and makes it bigger than it is, larger than life, sometimes that gets you in trouble. We\u2019ve played in a lot of big games. We\u2019ve got a lot of people in our team room and in that building that have played in big football games. So they\u2019re not going to be intimidated by that.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame hasn\u2019t won a national title since 1988. In recent years, the Irish have been blown out in some of their biggest contests, such as a 42-14 drubbing by Alabama in the 2013 BCS championship game and a 30-3 loss to Clemson in the semifinals of last season\u2019s College Football Playoff.\n\nBut Notre Dame continues to hold a special place in college football.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t changed at bit.\n\n\u201cWell, people either love them or hate them,\u201d Dooley said. \u201cThey\u2019ve always got interest, regardless of what it is.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Georgia players know it's a big game.
