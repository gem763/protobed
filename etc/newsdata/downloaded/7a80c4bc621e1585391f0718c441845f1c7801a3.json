REUTERS/Stephane Mahe\n\nA day ahead of a federal election that looked as though it could spell the end for one of the world\u2019s last remaining progressive leaders, the Trudeau team is seeing signs of hope.\n\nSurveys of public opinion still indicate that Trudeau will lose his majority in Parliament and be forced to rely on the support of smaller parties.\n\nBut talk of an outright loss to the main opposition Conservative Party of Andrew Scheer is fading and a weekend of bad headlines for the Conservatives has energized Liberal aides.\n\nThe Globe and Mail reported Scheer\u2019s team had hired a company to \u201cseek and destroy\u201d the campaign of the People\u2019s Party of Canada (PPC), a new splinter movement that threatens to split the Conservative vote. The PPC is threatening legal action and accused the party of \u201cdirty politics\u201d.\n\nTwo senior aides on Trudeau\u2019s plane even said it might still be possible to win a majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons, which is unlikely if opinion polls and the Liberals own forecasts are accurate.\n\nThe party\u2019s current slim majority of seven is expected to be wiped out by losses in Quebec, Atlantic Canada and the West, according to the party\u2019s internal projections, and the prospects for making up the difference are unclear.\n\nThe mood though is much more upbeat than in the days after photos emerged on Sept. 18 of Trudeau in blackface at an Arabian Nights-themed party in 2001 when he was a 29-year-old teacher. More images emerged the next day from the 1990s.\n\nRelated Coverage Canada's frontrunners slam Quebec sovereignty comment on final day of election campaign\n\nSome campaign aides were deeply unhappy, two sources said, and felt obliged to have uncomfortable conversations with their young children about racism for the first time. The malaise spread to the tour in the days afterward and Trudeau, who repeatedly apologised for the images, gave flat performances to subdued supporters.\n\nLast Thursday on a cold wet evening in Montreal, the atmosphere was very different. Two legislators and Trudeau\u2019s wife Sophie whipped up the crowd before the Liberal leader appeared and spoke freely, for the first time ditching his electronic aides.\n\nThe next night, on the outskirts of Toronto, Trudeau told a rally that his father \u2013 former Liberal Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau - had been born 100 years ago that day, Oct. 18, and that he had been a fighter. His father, Trudeau said, would not have worried about encountering rough weather while paddling a canoe because his approach was to \u201csing louder and paddle harder\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe ditched the teleprompter because he wants to talk more directly to people,\u201d said one aide.\n\nTrudeau also made other changes. Dozy days that saw the 47-year-old leader do one or two events are gone, replaced by a last-week frenzy.\n\nIn the last 10 days of the campaign, Trudeau\u2019s campaign started visiting parliamentary constituencies held by opposition legislators, signalling that he was on the attack.\n\nHe put in a 21-hour day on Friday, making four stops in Ontario before flying two hours west for an event in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Trudeau engaged in good natured banter with supporters, urging them to boo whenever he brought up the name of Conservative leader Scheer.\n\nLiberal voter Heather Stanus said she was not bothered by the blackface incident since \u201ceveryone has things in their past they wish they had done differently\u201d.\n\nLiberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigns for the upcoming election, in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada October 20, 2019.

This is one potential problem for the Liberals and a second is low turnout, which tends to favour the Conservatives, who have a more committed base.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many seats that are still toss ups, especially in Quebec and Ontario,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of pollster Ipsos Public Affairs. \u201cWe also know that about 10% of voters make up their mind in the voting booth.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, hit by scandals and locked in a near dead-heat ahead of Monday's election, has put away his teleprompter and taken his campaign on the offensive.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443083527&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0MH", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
