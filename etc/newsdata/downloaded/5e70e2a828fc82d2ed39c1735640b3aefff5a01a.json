While the responses of parents are natural, studies have shown they also leave children suffering from debilitating anxiety into adulthood,\" said Eli Lebowitz, associate director of the Anxiety and Mood Disorders Program at the Yale Child Study Center and lead author of the study, which expanded into a program at Yale that counsels parents.\n\nBaker shared her experience in the online publication Motherly writing, \"the writing was on the wall: my anxiety had become a problem.\"\n\n\"The wisdom I received from being in therapy was that the better option was to help him face what he was afraid of,\" Baker said.\n\nABC\n\nBaker said she learned mindful breathing to calm her own anxiety.
