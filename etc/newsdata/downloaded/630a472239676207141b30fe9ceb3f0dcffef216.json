I trust the good sense of MPs who value the country\u2019s stability,\u201d Dancila told PSD lawmakers Tuesday.\n\nThe motion demanding the government\u2019s sacking had received 237 signatures.\n\n\u2013 Lobbying lawmakers \u2013\n\nDancila has since instructed her own party lawmakers to abstain from voting to prevent possible \u201cbetrayals\u201d and has tried to woo support, promising to pay local communities 300 million euros ($330 million) this Friday to make sure their MPs back her.\n\nLawmakers likely to change sides have also been offered public service posts and spots on party lists for next year\u2019s legislative elections.\n\nThe result of the vote is eagerly awaited in Brussels after Dancila\u2019s candidate for EU commissioner was rejected. Newly-elected European Commission head, Ursula von der Leyen, has requested a replacement.\n\nDancila \u2014 whose PSD has been in power since late 2016 but has seen massive protests over controversial judicial reforms \u2014 is also due to run in presidential elections with the first round scheduled for November 10.\n\nIncumbent centre-right President Klaus Iohannis already looks set to be re-elected for a second term, and an overthrow of Dancila\u2019s government would weaken her chances even further.\n\nIf the motion succeeds, Iohannis will consult parties before appointing a new prime minister to run the poor, corruption-plagued EU member until legislative elections scheduled for the end of next year.\n\nUndermined by internal dissent, the opposition has so far failed to agree on an alternative candidate to Dancila.\n\nOne option is former transport minister Ludovic Orban, leader of the Liberals, which Iohannis used to head, but he enjoys far from unanimous backing.\n\nWhatever the outcome of the vote, the government \u2014 current or new \u2014 will have the delicate task of writing the budget for 2020, complicated by an explosion of public spending in recent months as the PSD struggles to stay in power.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has already warned that Romania risks surpassing the three percent public deficit ceiling imposed by the EU, urging Bucharest to give up on a PSD promise of doubling pensions by 2022.", "description": "Bucharest (AFP) \u2013 Romania\u2019s beleaguered left-wing government risks collapse in a no-confidence vote Thursday, just weeks before a presidential", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/fd816b_viorica-dancila-pressure-controversial-judicial-reforms-she-is-confident-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
