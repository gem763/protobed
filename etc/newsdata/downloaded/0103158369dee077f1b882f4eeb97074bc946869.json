I got worked over.\u201d\n\nWallace says the power dynamic eventually ruined everything, including her career, as their relationship went bad.\n\n\u201cAs she left the show, she recalled him yelling, \u2018You will never get credit,\u2019\u201d Farrow reports. \u201cThen the network deployed a tactic the public was barely conscious of at the time: it offered her a substantial payout to sign a binding nondisclosure agreement.\u201d\n\nYeah, that\u2019s another bubbling issue with NBC News \u2014 these Weinstein-esque non-disclosure agreement.\n\nImagine that \u2014 a purported news organization looking to silence people.\n\nWallace reluctantly took the money.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t till I really got out of there that I felt the full force of it. Of how disgusted I was,\u201d she says. \u201cThe truth is, if he hadn\u2019t been like that, I would have kept that job. I loved that job.\u201d\n\nLack denies any wrongdoing.\n\nLaird told Farrow a story very similar to Wallace\u2019s, a story of how ugly and retaliatory Lack allegedly became once the sexual affair went sour.\n\n\u201cWhen Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Farrow reports. \u201cHe compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d\n\nLack denies any wrongdoing.\n\nMy wife and I met on the job, and there was an aggressive pursuit on my part. But we were both single and worked in separate departments. There was no power dynamic. Based on my own history and my own 30 years of marital bliss, I worry about how all this #MeToo stuff is penalizing the normal, human mating ritual.\n\nLack, however, does not qualify as someone to worry over. Put yourself in Wallace\u2019s position, one where your married boss, the man who holds your career in his hands, is asking you to dinner every day for a month. That sounds excruciating. Now add to that the alleged retaliation aimed at Wallace and Laird as the sexual relationship came to an end.\n\nWhat\u2019s especially ironic about all of this is Lack was brought into NBC News to help steer the ship after Brian Williams was caught telling countless lies about himself. But now Lack has embroiled the network in an institutional scandal that grows worse by the day.\n\nOn top of his own alleged misbehavior, Lack also allowed Farrow to walk out the door with the Weinstein story, a story or enormous cultural consequence that won a Pulitzer. As of now, Lack has still not sufficiently explained why he sent Farrow down the road to the New Yorker. At the very least \u2014 and this is important \u2014 Farrow had obtained audio of Weinstein admitting he groped a model. If Farrow had nothing else, that was a huge story all on its own, but Lack let it all go.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, according to Farrow it\u2019s because NBC wanted to do business with Weinstein. Farrow also believes so many NBC suits were compromised by their own sexual indiscretions, some of which Weinstein allegedly knew about and threatened to spill, they were willing to pass up a Pulitzer.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Lack\u2019s claim neither he nor anyone at NBC knew of Matt Lauer\u2019s alleged predations until the day Lauer was fired, is also taking on water.\n\nSo pop the popcorn and enjoy yourself as the hits just keep on coming for far-left NBC News.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
