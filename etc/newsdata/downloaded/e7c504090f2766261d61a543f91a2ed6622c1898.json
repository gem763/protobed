Hong Kong teen racer Frederick Lee of Canadian International School says it\u2019s way harder", "language": "en", "text": "The first thing that comes to mind when you talk about karting might be Mario Kart, but to Frederick Lee Fu-kwan, the sport is more than a game \u2013 and the thrill of conquering the game\u2019s notoriously tricky Rainbow Road doesn\u2019t come close to how he feels when he\u2019s racing in real life.\n\nThe 16-year-old began his karting journey in 2016, when his father enrolled him in a programme offered by local racing star Darryl O\u2019Young. In the years since, Frederick has become one of Hong Kong\u2019s elite go-kart drivers.\n\nSince advancing from the junior events for racers under 14, Frederick has been taking on older, stronger, and more experienced drivers in the senior category. He competes in races across the mainland, as well as in first-rate circuits like the IAME International Final.\n\nRacing star Dan Wells on why he drives under the Hong Kong flag and the challenges of motorsports\n\n\u201cI\u2019m usually the youngest driver, and my opponents are in their mid- to late-20s,\u201d he told Young Post, adding that he tries to think more maturely when racing with them.\n\nStill, the age difference doesn\u2019t seem to stop Frederick from winning \u2013 he has made it on to the podium 11 times out of a total of 14 races this year.\n\nUnlike in Mario Kart, there are no power boosts or detours when racing. To whizz past his opponents, Frederick says it\u2019s all about taking chances.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, I was scared of crashing, so I took no risks and I was always behind,\u201d Frederick recalled. \u201cIt was my mum who told me to stop worrying and just go for it, so I did.\u201d\n\nFrederick Lee trains in Zhuhai and competes in races across China.

That race was proof to Frederick that success doesn\u2019t come if you don\u2019t take risks.\n\nBeing daring doesn\u2019t come without its drawbacks, though, and the karting star said he has been in a number of crashes. The worst involved his kart flipping over and flying up in the air, before crashing off the track. He was, thankfully, uninjured because of all of his safety gear.\n\n\u201cMy dad ran over immediately, but I was okay. I\u2019m sure my parents are worried about me [racing], but they also trust that I can handle myself,\u201d he said.\n\nFormula Three racer Sophia Floersch is ready to return to the track after recovering from THAT Macau Grand Prix crash\n\nFrederick doesn\u2019t just fearlessness to win, though. The sport is all about physical \u2013 especially arm and core \u2013 strength, and having a game plan.\n\nHe explained there are many rounds in a racing tournament, starting with practice sessions, qualifiers, and heats, which are followed by a pre-final and the final race, which can last up to 26 laps. Frederick needs to plan carefully how fast and hard he drives in each round, taking into account the number of tyres he can swap and when to do so.\n\nThe Canadian International School of Hong Kong student admitted that, what with training and races on the mainland almost every weekend, it is physically and mentally taxing for him to try and balance both his studies and karting.\n\nFrederick Lee Fu-kwan picked up the sport three years ago when he joined a programme offered by Hong Kong famed driver Darryl O'Young.

Flights to and from the mainland are often subject to changes, too, which means he might end up going straight from the airport to school on Monday morning.\n\nStill, he has never thought about putting the brakes on his karting career. He wants to apply to a British university next year, as some there have their own racing engineering team, and are always on the look out for budding drivers like Frederick to join them.\n\nIf there is one thing that Frederick wants for Hong Kong in the long-term, it\u2019s for the city to reintroduce tournaments like the Hong Kong International Kart Prix (which ended in 1993), so that the sport can be more widely recognised.\n\n\u201cTraining and competing in China is time-consuming and expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cMost drivers in Hong Kong want to have a local racetrack. Even a small one would do.\u201d\n\nEdited by Ginny Wong", "description": "The 16-year-old student athlete competes in IAME International events around the world.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/b76a0ed8-e58f-11e9-8a10-b9721f28293eimagehires115832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
