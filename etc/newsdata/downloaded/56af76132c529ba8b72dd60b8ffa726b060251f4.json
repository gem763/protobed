She\u2019s running neck and neck with Joe Biden in the polls \u2014 and Biden\u2019s campaign is living hand-to-mouth. The former \u201csenator from MBNA\u201d is losing to a democratic socialist at the fundraising game. And time seems to be depleting Biden\u2019s (always limited) verbal skills even faster than it\u2019s draining his campaign coffers. Meanwhile, the most viable alternative for \u201cLeave Billionaires Alone\u201d Democrats seems to be a college-town mayor with fewer black supporters than Donald Trump. As of this writing, betting markets now put the odds of blue America nominating either Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders in 2020 at over 50 percent.\n\nDavos Democrats are nonplussed. Each night, consultants of a certain age toss and turn through dreams of George McGovern. Now, many are succumbing to magical thinking. As the New York Times reports:\n\nWhen a half-dozen Democratic donors gathered at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan last week, the dinner began with a discussion of which presidential candidates the contributors liked. But as conversations among influential Democrats often go these days, the meeting quickly evolved into a discussion of who was not in the race \u2014 but could be lured in.\n\nWould Hillary Clinton get in, the contributors wondered, and how about Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor? One person even mused whether Michelle Obama would consider a late entry, according to two people who attended the event, which was hosted by the progressive group American Bridge.\n\nBloomberg is reportedly mulling a run, but could never win. Michelle Obama could win, but would never run. Hillary Clinton is almost certainly not delusional enough to throw her hat in the ring. And none of the other names floated by the Whitby diners \u2014 Deval Patrick, Eric Holder, John Kerry, and Sherrod Brown \u2014 have any obvious advantage over the standard-issue Dems already in the race. If Kamala Harris and Cory Booker aren\u2019t connecting, why would a slapdash Patrick or Holder campaign hit the mark? And what does Brown offer that Klobuchar doesn\u2019t (beyond the opportunity to squander a precious Senate vote)?\n\nThe idea that the primary electorate would eagerly support a garden-variety moderate Democrat (who boasts no special connection to Barack Obama) if only they had more than a dozen such candidates to choose from, is manifestly absurd. But the Whitby crowd\u2019s longing for some kind of 2020 \u201cdo over\u201d is entirely understandable.\n\nCentrist Democrats entered this cycle with a fairly strong hand. Polls consistently found a majority of Democratic voters saying they preferred a maximally electable nominee over an ideologically ideal one. What\u2019s more, in some surveys, a plurality of the primary electorate evinced a preference for a return to Obamaism over big structural change. To be sure, if progressives consolidated their votes behind a single standard-bearer \u2014 one with at least a modicum of appeal to African-Americans in the South \u2014 they could still pose a real threat. But the looming left-on-left battle between two light-skinned New Englanders seemed to nullify that risk. Everything was coming up incrementalism.\n\nSo, how did center-left Democrats end up in a position so desperate, the concept of \u201cJohn Kerry 2020\u201d strikes them as cause for consideration instead of laughter?\n\nThere are probably an infinite number of (partially) correct answers to that question. But if I had to limit myself to three:\n\n1. Kamala Harris doesn\u2019t have \u201cit.\u201d The California senator may be too liberal for some corporate donors, but she certainly doesn\u2019t unnerve the party\u2019s Wall Street wing the way Warren and Sanders do. And Harris began the 2020 race with a significant amount of Establishment buy-in. For a brief period after her campaign launch, she polled near the top of the pack. But the spotlight exposed Harris\u2019s relative inexperience on the national stage. Her desire to have it both ways on Medicare for All put her in the worst of both worlds \u2014 boasting a health-care plan too radical for centrists\u2019 taste, and too craven for the progressive faithful. Her attack on Biden\u2019s busing record earned short-term accolades, but no durable gains with African-American voters. And then Warren began eating into her share of the #Resistance vote (for lack of a better term). Harris\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t quite dead \u2014 she\u2019s still only a hair behind Mayor Pete in national polls. But her failure to launch pushed a lot of Establishment actors into Biden\u2019s corner.\n\n2. Joe Biden is losing it (and much too slowly). The former vice-president\u2019s resilient appeal among a wide swath of the Democratic rank and file blunted what little momentum Harris had, and prevented the party\u2019s moderate factions from consolidating behind any other candidate. But Biden also appears incapable of speaking in complete sentences for longer than a few minutes at a time. Cognitively and physically, he looks like a man in decline. His campaign schedule is light, and debate performances often cringeworthy. And yet, for all the turbulence Biden\u2019s senescence has generated, his campaign has stayed aloft. Uncle Joe is still slightly ahead in the national polling average and in the early states of Iowa and Nevada. If South Carolina\u2019s primary election were held today, meanwhile, Biden would collect nearly all of the Palmetto State\u2019s delegates. Biden\u2019s advantage over Warren has gone from commanding to essentially nonexistent. But he remains formidable enough to leave other moderates with little room for growth. Especially since \u2026\n\n3. The outsize role of money in politics now puts corporate Democrats at a disadvantage (in Democratic presidential primaries, anyway). This point may be controversial (and a little premature). But small-dollar online fundraising seems to have radically changed the political economy of presidential campaigns. Twitter is not \u201creal life\u201d; there are fewer highly engaged, ideologically committed progressive voters in the primary electorate than your social-media feed would suggest. But there are still way more progressive ideologues in this world than there are pro-choice financiers who are willing to donate the maximum $2,800 to a Democratic presidential campaign. Meanwhile, progressive Democrats don\u2019t just tweet more than moderate ones \u2014 they also spend more of their disposal income on politics. Thus, candidates who command the enthusiasm of progressive news junkies now have a much easier time making payroll than those who don\u2019t. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren aren\u2019t just out-raising their rivals, they\u2019re doing so without having to expend precious time and energy on ritzy fundraisers. Amy Klobuchar\u2019s \u201cno we can\u2019t\u201d message may have its virtues, but it doesn\u2019t open all that many wallets. Which means as long as the big-dollar donors hedge their bets, our \u201cbroken\u201d campaign-finance system has the effect of marginalizing pro-business voices (if only in the uniquely high-visibility context of a Democratic presidential primary).\n\nAll of which is to say, the Whitby Democrats\u2019 fantasies of a Michelle Obama candidacy may be delusional, but this delusion is an understandable response to a grim reality. Their faction has unintentionally placed all of its bets on an old, increasingly lame horse who was infamous for mounting lousy presidential runs when he was in his prime. Some moderate donors are still telling themselves Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, or Amy Klobuchar have a chance. But the available evidence suggests those candidates\u2019 prospects are only slightly better than those of Michael Bloomberg, John Kerry, and Deval Patrick. Biden is (almost certainly) the Establishment\u2019s only hope.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good news for Democrats who are hoping for \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d", "description": "Democratic donors are hoping Michelle Obama, or Michael Bloomberg will jump into the 2020 primary.
