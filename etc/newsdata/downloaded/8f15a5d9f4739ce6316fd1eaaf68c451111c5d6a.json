However, the state government is now allowing for extra time to test Service NSW's online platforms.\n\n\"We've been really, really, really, really cautious about the environments, the scale, the survivability, the quality of the applications, [and] the security of the applications. We have orchestrated this within an inch of its life with all the partners just to make sure we've got all the things in place to make it the best experience with the most possibility for a successful launch,\" Fechner said, during New Relic Future Stack 2019 in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\nDigital driver licences in NSW have been in the pilot phase for nearly a year. It kicked off in Dubbo, allowing participants to use their digital driver licence for proof-of-identity and proof-of-age to gain entry into pubs and clubs, as well as for roadside police checks.\n\nThe metro trial of the digital driver licence began in November last year across Sydney's Eastern Beaches, allowing more than 140,000 licence holders in the region to ditch the plastic identification card for a smartphone-rendered copy, available via the Service NSW app.\n\nThe digital driver licence trial follows the passage of legislation at the start of last year which enabled the state-wide rollout of the technology.\n\nAmendments to the Road Transport Act 2013, the Photo Card Act 2005, the Gaming and Liquor Administration Act 2007, and the Liquor Act 2007 also provided drivers with the option to use their digital licence in place of the physical card for proof-of-identity and proof-of-age purposes.\n\nThe state government made the first wave of its digital licences available through the \"My Licences\" digital wallet in the Service NSW app in late 2016, with the app enabling NSW residents to renew their licences and update their details without needing to visit a Service NSW centre.\n\nThe digital driver licence will join the recreational fishing, responsible service of alcohol, and responsible conduct of gambling competency cards in the digital wallet.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nQueenslanders could be next to get digital driver's licence\n\nPilot slated for late-2019.\n\nL-platers are leading the charge towards digital licences in South Australia\n\nAround 25 percent of the state's learner drivers have signed up for the initiative that forms part of South Australia's broader plan to align government data.\n\nVictoria adopts Australia Post digital proof-of-age card\n\nFollowing a trial in Fitzroy, licensed premises across Victoria will accept the digital equivalent of the Keypass card.\n\nDriver's licence renewal goes digital in NSW\n\nThe New South Wales government has launched online licence renewals through its Service NSW web and mobile sites.", "description": "Digital driver's licence in NSW was meant to be available soon after the state election in March.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/20/cf219fe6-f1ec-410f-9a2b-c666e0b50b79/thumbnail/770x578/87e939fedd61d27a71c7500334562c18/digital-driver-licence-service-nsw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
