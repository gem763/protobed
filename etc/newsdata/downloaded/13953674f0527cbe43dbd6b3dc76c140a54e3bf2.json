So it makes no difference,\u201d said replacement flyhalf Camille Lopez.\n\n\u201cWe were better than them. You tell yourself it\u2019s impossible to lose this match, but in the end, you lose it anyway. It\u2019s hugely frustrating, because it\u2019s a match we had in our grasp.\n\n\u201cYou learn from defeats, but after a while, enough is enough. We mustn\u2019t accept that in future. We can\u2019t accept matches like tonight\u2019s. We have to be killers, especially in a competition like this.\u201d\n\nThe defeat was particularly galling as it came after a similar loss to Wales in this year\u2019s Six Nations, when the French surrendered a 16-0 halftime lead to go down 24-19.\n\nAs in Paris in February, France\u2019s discipline cost them dear not only because of the red card but also with errors of handling and judgement.\n\n\u201cAfterwards we flipped,\u201d said flanker Wenceslas Lauret. \u201cIt\u2019s the top level - little details, as we say every time. In these matches, you can\u2019t make a mistake \u2013 you\u2019ll pay dearly. We lacked discipline.\u201d\n\nThe defeat brought the curtain down on the two-year reign of coach Jacques Brunel.\n\nThe 65-year-old oversaw two fourth-placed finishes in the Six Nations and a departure from the World Cup before the semi-finals for only the third time in nine tournaments.\n\nThe French host the next World Cup in 2023 so the pressure to perform on home soil will be even greater.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe likes of Damian Penaud, Antoine Dupont and Gregory Alldritt have shown there is young talent aplenty in the French game and the task for new coach Fabien Galthie will be forging it into a team that can play for a full 80 minutes in one match.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s regrettable but we have to move forward and keep working,\u201d Lopez added after Sunday\u2019s defeat.\n\n\u201cIt stops tonight, but French rugby doesn\u2019t stop tonight.\u201d", "description": "In the end, the answer to the question of which France would turn up at the World Cup was a bit of the team that plays rugby with flair and ambition but also a bit of the ill-disciplined rabble that can conjure defeat from the jaws of victory.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443197661&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K05W", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
