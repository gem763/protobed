But even if the GOP were to go down in defeat, some experts cautioned the political situation in each state is so different that the outcomes may not signal much in terms of national trends.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible but not likely that Democrats can sweep all of this year\u2019s gubernatorial races,\u201d said veteran political analyst Charlie Cook. \u201cRepublicans are underperforming how those states usually vote, but I would be surprised if they lost all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are all three very different local situations and states for the Democrats,\u201d said Ron Faucheux, a former Louisiana elected official who is now a Washington political analyst and consultant. \u201cIn Kentucky you have a GOP candidate who is in trouble, and in Louisiana you have a Democrat who is actually pretty popular personally but, from a partisan standpoint, that\u2019s still a risk factor. If the Democrats are going to win two out of three, it will probably be there.\u201d\n\nMississippi appears to be the Republican bulwark that will hold in November, according to prognosticators, but that is far from certain, and the Democrats have a chance of winning one of the races outright in Louisiana\u2019s Oct. 12 jungle primary.\n\nIn Kentucky, Republican incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin is being challenged by Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, whose father held the governor\u2019s seat before Mr. Bevin.\n\nMr. Bevin has an aggressive personal style, but the general landscape in the Bluegrass State is favorable to Republicans.\n\nReliable polling is scarce, with RealClearPolitics showing just two polls, neither very recent, with one favoring Mr. Beshear by 8 points and the other, from June, giving a 6-point lead to Mr. Bevin. Polls posted by FiveThirtyEight in August show Mr. Beshear with a healthy lead, while the Cook Political Report slots the race as a toss-up.\n\nThe Democratic drive to impeach President Trump, which has kicked into overdrive since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi green lighted a formal inquiry into the president\u2019s July 25 phone call during which he pressed the Ukrainian president to investigate former vice president Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter, probably will rally Republicans and help Mr. Bevin, many experts predicted.\n\nMr. Beshear has tried to stay above the fray, although Republicans are trying to pin him down on whether he believes impeachment is appropriate, according to Kentucky media.\n\n\u201cKentucky is awfully close, but that is more about missteps by Bevin than Trump or the national party,\u201d Mr. Cook told The Washington Times.\n\nIn Louisiana, the two main Republican challengers to incumbent Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards have tried getting Mr. Edwards on the record regarding impeachment.\n\nOne of them, Baton Rouge businessman Eddie Rispone, who is bankrolling his political debut with $11.5 million of his own money and has made his unwavering support for Mr. Trump his campaign\u2019s main plank, on Wednesday rolled out a video linking Mr. Edwards to congressional Democrats.\n\nCalling impeachment a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Mr. Rispone said Mr. Edwards backs the Democrats in Congress whether he broadcasts his support or not.\n\n\u201cLiberal John Bel Edwards cannot run from his own party,\u201d Mr. Rispone said. \u201cHe was a superdelegate for Barack Obama in 2012 and again for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Liberal John Bel Edwards does not support President Trump, he supports radical leftists like Maxine Waters, Nancy Pelosi and the Squad, and he is going to support whatever lunatic they put up against our president this time.\u00a8\n\nMr. Edwards has tread carefully since Mr. Trump won Louisiana by 18 points. While clearly opposed to much of the president\u2019s agenda, he has not displayed any overt hostility.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s actually been very respectful with Trump,\u201d Mr. Faucheux said. \u201cHe\u2019s treated him like the president, not some political enemy.\u00a8\n\nNevertheless, in a series of Tuesday tweets, Mr. Trump threw his weight behind Mr. Rispone or Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham.\n\n\u201cREPUBLICANS of Louisiana,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cIt is really important for you to go out and vote on Oct. 12 for either Eddie Rispone or Ralph Abraham (both Great), which will lead to a runoff against a Nancy Pelosi/Chuck Schumer Democrat (John Bel Edwards) who does nothing but stymie all the things we are doing to Make America Great Again,\u201d Mr. Trump continued. \u201cDon\u00b4t be fooled, John Bel Edwards will NEVER be for us.\u201d\n\nWith early voting having started, Mr. Edwards approaches the Oct. 12 primary with a strong lead in the polls, though it is not clear if he will clear the 50 percent plus 1 of the vote needed to avoid a November runoff against the second-place vote getter.\n\nEarly voting is going better for Republicans than expected because Democrats don\u2019t appear energized, according to pollster John Couvillon.\n\nMr. Edwards has proven unflappable in two debates thus far, saying he turned a state deficit into a surplus and that his policies have Louisiana moving in a positive direction.\n\n\u201cJohn Bel Edwards has a very good chance of winning without a runoff, that is the best shot for Democrats,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cBut that says more about Edwards, the Republican Party in Louisiana and the hangover from Bobby Jindal\u2019s eight years as governor than reflecting on the national party of President Trump.\u201d\n\nThe race might not reflect on the Democrats nationally, either, according to Mr. Faucheux.\n\n\u201cYou just have very different dynamics in all these races, and the quality of the candidates could have something to do with it all, too,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure how much any of these three outcomes says about the Democratic Party as a whole.\u201d\n\nMississippi has a similar scene, although its current governor, Republican Phil Bryant, is term-limited.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Trump endorsed Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves.\n\n\u201cTate is strong on crime, tough on illegal immigration, and will protect your Second Amendment,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cHe loves our Military and supports our Vets!\u201d\n\nBut recent polls from Hickman Analytics in August and September showed Democratic Attorney General Jim Hood with a narrow lead, albeit within the polls\u2019 margin of error.\n\nThat could be partly because Mr. Reeves faced a grueling primary battle against former state Supreme Court chief justice Bill Waller Jr., an establishment Republican, who has declined to endorse Mr. Reeves in the general election.\n\nThat raises sour memories for Republicans of infighting that doomed the party\u2019s chances in Louisiana in 2015, when Mr. Edwards rode a fractured opposition to what proved a convincing victory over then-Republican Sen. David Vitter.\n\nIt also could have something to do with the retail politicking skills of each candidate, with most analysts giving the edge to Mr. Hood. His ads feature a hunter who drives his pickup truck to work, not a Democrat seething about Mr. Trump.\n\nStill, the Cook Political Report in late September moved the Mississippi race into the \u201cleans Republican\u201d column, partly on the expectation Mr. Trump would stump for Mr. Reeves on the campaign trail, either before or after the race\u2019s only debate Oct. 10.\n\nMississippi could have one final curveball in store: a state law from the Jim Crow era that requires the gubernatorial winner to carry not only a majority of the popular vote but also a majority of the 122 state legislative districts, a quirk that could hurt Mr. Hood in a close election.\n\nRepublicans hope they can get Mr. Trump to also make appearances in Louisiana should Mr. Edwards be forced into a runoff. The Cook report currently rates it \u201cleans Democratic.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
