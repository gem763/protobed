Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a member of one of the three House committees investigating President Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, said he\u2019s \u201cnot at all\u201d concerned that a second whistleblower has come forward.\n\nAttorneys representing the first whistleblower, a U.S. intelligence operative whose identity has not been publicly released, confirmed Sunday that a second person has corroborated some of the allegations regarding Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d host Chris Wallace reported that the second whistleblower presented the inspector general for the intelligence community with firsthand information about the call.\n\n\u201cDoes that concern you?\u201d he asked Stewart, a member of the House Intelligence Committee.\n\n\u201cWell, actually, not at all,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cOne of our concerns has always been there hasn\u2019t been firsthand knowledge of this. The first whistleblower \u2015 virtually everything he accused was second and thirdhand knowledge.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Chris, it does not matter,\u201d he continued, adding that he believed the second whistleblower would only confirm the call happened. \u201cWhy should I care at all what his perspective ... of this transcript is?\u201d\n\nRep Chris Stewart joined FOX News Sunday exclusively-- a Republican on the Intelligence Committee. He responds to reports of another whistle blower coming forward. #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/d7ykJZHKCd \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) October 6, 2019\n\nRep Chris Stewart on #FNS reacts to President Trump's call for Ukraine to investigate the Biden's.

He has claimed that his interest in investigating Biden is about \u201ccorruption\u201d and has nothing to do with the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cCan you tell me of any other instance during the time President Trump has been in office where he asked a foreign leader to investigate a specific American on the issue of corruption?\u201d Wallace asked Stewart on Sunday.\n\nThe congressman responded that Attorney General William Barr had done so.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Wallace interrupted. \u201cI said President Trump. Can you tell me of another instance where President Trump on a conversation ... has publicly or privately asked a foreign leader to investigate a specific American?\u201d\n\nStewart claimed there\u2019s \u201cno difference\u201d between Trump and Barr asking a foreign leader to investigate an American on allegations of corruption.\n\nLove HuffPost?
