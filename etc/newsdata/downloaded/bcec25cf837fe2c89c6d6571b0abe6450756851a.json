That figure includes arrests of people who crossed the border illegally and those who went to legal border crossings, of which CBP processes about 10,000 a month.\n\nThe August figures are about 30% lower than July\u2019s numbers, continuing a sharp decline in illegal crossings since reaching a 13-year high of 132,900 apprehensions in May. In eight of the last 10 years, border arrests rose from July to August, suggesting August\u2019s drop in border arrests doesn\u2019t track with seasonal trends.\n\nThe turnaround is a victory for the Trump administration, which has stepped up efforts in recent months to stem the flow of migrants north, including policies requiring some migrants to apply for asylum in the countries they cross before reaching the U.S. and sending other asylum seekers to await their immigration court dates in Mexico.\n\nThis spring, President Trump threatened to place tariffs on all Mexican exports, a direct threat against the country\u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a leftist nationalist who campaigned on standing up to Mr. Trump and who slowed deportations of Central American migrants out of Mexico in the first few months of his tenure.\n\nTo skirt the tariff threat, Mexico agreed to significantly boost its own deportations in a landmark June agreement with the U.S.\u2014and its stepped-up efforts appear to be paying off.\n\n\u201cI want to again thank the country of Mexico,\u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that thousands of Mexican soldiers were \u201cright now protecting our border and they\u2019ve done a fantastic job.\u201d\n\nAs part of the deal with Mr. Trump, Mexico dispatched more than 20,000 members of its National Guard, a newly created force under military command, to Mexico\u2019s southern and northern borders to support immigration officials. Mexican authorities installed dozens of checkpoints at roads all across Mexico and raided hotels and safe houses in search of illegal migrants.\n\nArdilio Alexander Men\u00e9ndez, a 39-year-old from El Salvador, decided to head for the U.S. with his 17-year-old son after the construction-materials company where he had worked for 19 years laid him off and competing gangs attempted to recruit his son at school. His wife and younger son are living in Maryland, where they are awaiting their asylum claim to be processed.\n\nHe took buses and hitchhiked portions of the journey north, guided by Google Maps, before he was caught by Mexican officers at a road checkpoint in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nThere, Mexican authorities detained him for 15 days in a shelter, which Mr. Men\u00e9ndez said was rarely cleaned and where he was served spoiled food. Then, he was sent on a 23-hour bus ride back to El Salvador with several other deported migrants. Mexican authorities have admitted that detention facilities are in \u201cterrible conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, I feel happy because I\u2019m in my country, but on the other hand, I\u2019m disappointed because I was dreaming of being with family and finding a better life for my children,\u201d Mr. Men\u00e9ndez said in Spanish, soon after getting off the bus in San Salvador. Asked if he would attempt to reach the U.S. again, he said, \u201cOf course. There\u2019s nothing for me here.\u201d\n\nDeportations in Mexico jumped to 84,000 in the January-July period, a 38% increase compared with the same period of last year, while apprehensions rose 76%, data from Mexico\u2019s immigration agency showed. Deportations in June hit a 13-year high. The vast majority of those deported are migrants from the so-called Northern Triangle countries\u2014Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\n\nMexico\u2019s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, plans to travel to Washington next week to review the June agreement. A top Mexican official at the foreign ministry said the U.S. seems to be satisfied with Mexico\u2019s response so far because the monthly flow of Central American asylum seekers crossing through Mexico fell more than 40% compared with May.\n\nThe official said the crackdown on irregular immigration will continue \u201cindefinitely,\u201d not just for the 90 days originally agreed with the U.S. in June. \u201cThis will be a permanent effort,\u201d the official said.\n\nSome experts are skeptical of the Mexican government\u2019s ability to keep up the deportations long term, since the country has diverted National Guard and army soldiers from their regular duties to carry out deportations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new level of enforcement, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s sustainable,\u201d said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration think tank in Washington.\n\nThe rising number of apprehensions and deportations\u2014and the increasing hurdles to request asylum in the U.S.\u2014not only prevented many migrants already in Mexico from getting to the U.S.-Mexico border, but also discouraged new movements, experts say. Many migrants have decided against leaving now and plan to wait for more favorable times.\n\n\u201cMexico has become too hostile for them. Many are in a wait-and-see mode,\u201d said H\u00e9ctor Silva, the head of a migrant shelter in the Mexican border city of Reynosa. He said the flow of migrants at his shelter fell by 15% since June.\n\nMexican authorities believe the U.S. won\u2019t put forward during next week\u2019s meeting in Washington a proposal to turn Mexico into a so-called \u201csafe third country,\u201d which would force Guatemalans to seek asylum in Mexico instead of the U.S.\n\nThe Mexican official said that Mexico wouldn\u2019t accept in any scenario such a deal, in part because he said Mexico\u2019s Senate would never ratify it.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nIn late July, the U.S. and Guatemala signed a deal that would force Salvadorans and Hondurans to ask for asylum in Guatemala, but the agreement hasn\u2019t come into force yet and faces political and legal hurdles in Guatemala.\n\nWrite to Michelle Hackman at Michelle.Hackman@wsj.com and Juan Montes at juan.montes@wsj.com", "description": "The Mexican government\u2019s stepped-up effort to deport Central American migrants crossing its southern border has significantly stemmed the flow of unlawful migrants entering the U.S. in the past few months.", "authors": ["Michelle Hackman In San Salvador", "El Salvador", "Juan Montes In Mexico City", "Michelle Hackman", "Juan Montes", "Michelle.Hackman Wsj.Com", "Juan.Montes Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104107/social"}
