Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, alleged that she blocked efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump himself, according to a White House summary, described her as \"bad news\" to Zelenskiy in a July 25 call in which he sought Zelinskiy's help to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, a former board member of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\n\"She's going to go through some things,\" Trump added.\n\n\"There is the particularly pernicious practice of going after individual career officers, either because they worked on controversial issues in the last administration, or as in the case of Masha Yovanovitch, a terrific apolitical career diplomat who was doing her job extraordinarily well, were attacked, deeply unfairly, for political reasons,\" Burns said.\n\n\"We have career people who did their jobs, followed their instructions, served their country loyally, and they are being treated as pawns in a political struggle,\" said a senior U.S diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nPompeo has tried to improve morale at the State Department. Last year, he nearly doubled promotions of top American diplomats as he sought to restore ties with a workforce alienated by his predecessor, Rex Tillerson.\n\nHowever, current and former officials say Trump's push to marginalize career diplomats can be seen in his proposed roughly 30% State Department budget cuts, his appointment of the highest proportion of political ambassadors in modern history and his drastic reduction in the number of career officials with confirmed posts as assistant secretaries of state and higher.\n\nAs a result, there are fewer top jobs in Washington or abroad available for the most senior U.S. diplomats.\n\nThe State Department has been whipsawed by major policy decisions abruptly announced by Trump over Twitter. These include a 2018 suspension of security aid to Pakistan and a breakoff of talks in September with the Taliban on a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nIt also has been shaken by high-profile investigations by the department inspector general and Congress into allegations of retaliation and other mistreatment of career officials by political appointees.", "description": "The treatment of U.S. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch - disparaged by President Donald Trump and abruptly recalled from Ukraine - exemplifies what current and former U.S. officials describe as a campaign by Trump against career diplomats.
