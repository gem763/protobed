That\u2019s because, underneath it all, lies an ugly world.\n\n\n\nSulli was a brave and outspoken woman ahead of her time\n\nA few years ago, Sulli took a hiatus from the entertainment industry due to cyberbullying. She had said that she couldn\u2019t take the negativity surrounding her. She was suffering from severe depression at the time of her passing, a fact that has led to speculation that she took her own life. How did it come to this?\n\nWell, for one thing, she dared to fight the status quo in an industry that makes its money by pretending things are all sparkle and joy, and that keeps its women docile and subservient.\n\nAn advocate for the \u2018free the nipple\u2019 movement, she was constantly pestered for showing her breasts on Instagram and other mediums. Her openness about the fact that she was suffering from mental health issues also caused a frenzy because women in this industry are expected to put up an unrealistically chaste and saccharine front of infantile beauty.\n\nSulli rejected these ideas and fans, conditioned to view popstars and actresses as emotionless dolls, hounded her for it.\n\nSouth Korea is more sexist than you think, and Sulli suffered because of it\n\nBullying, criticism, and pressure--all celebrities experience these things, and while it\u2019s common across industries, in the world of K-pop, rebellion isn\u2019t common. Contrary to the teeny-bopper image of hearts and bubbles that Korean actors and actresses are supposed to have, the actual state of affairs isn\u2019t as rosy. The sky-high expectations of perfection and shocking double standards perpetuated on female stars inevitably result in them being vilified and demonised for the slightest misstep.\n\nGoo Hara, a K-pop star, was recently in the news for attempting suicide after her boyfriend secretly filmed them having sex and threatened to leak their sex tape. Instead of sympathising with the horrible violation of privacy and betrayal of trust Hara experienced, she was bullied, slut shamed, and harassed by fans and media.\n\nJoy and Irene, members of K-pop band Red Velvet, saw their photos being burnt by K-pop stans for merely reading feminist literature. Such is the violent anti-woman sentiment in Korea hidden under the delusion of gender-positive fashion and clothing.\n\nSulli\u2019s death, if it is indeed a suicide as suspected, is a reality check for K-pop. It shouldn\u2019t take someone\u2019s death to acknowledge misogyny, especially in an industry with as much soft power as South Korea\u2019s popular entertainment.", "description": "Korean pop star Sulli\u2019s death by suspected suicide has raised questions about the dark misogyny and sexism against women rampant in K-pop.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://im.idiva.com/content/2019/Oct/iDiva_singer-and-actress-Sulli-found-dead-at-25_Social_5da5807a2eb9d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
