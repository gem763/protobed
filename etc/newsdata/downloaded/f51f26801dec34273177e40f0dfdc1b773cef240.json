The company had previously seen a loss of some 20 percent in share price over the past three months.\n\nAD\n\nWednesday\u2019s numbers are especially significant because they come three months after the first-ever drop in domestic Netflix subscribers since the company began its explosive growth earlier this decade. In the second quarter of this year, U.S. totals went down by 126,000 instead of rising. International adds at the time also were much lower than expected \u2014 2.8 million, two million fewer than analysts had predicted.\n\nThe company has said that the second quarter is typically more challenging than other quarters, a contention recent years have borne out. But the third quarter is usually strong \u2014 last year saw a jump of 7 million worldwide subscribers, nearly 40 percent higher than analysts expected.\n\nAD\n\nAt stake in the Netflix subscriber numbers is more than just a Wall Street earnings metrics. The figure represents how consumers will get their television in the years ahead \u2014 and whether a company that in just five short years has gone from also-ran to go-to entertainment destination can maintain its influence.\n\nAD\n\nWednesday\u2019s numbers come in a quarter in which Netflix released a new season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d and picked up 27 Emmys, both of which can boost subscription totals. The company said \u201cStranger Things\u201d was watched by 64 million member-households in the first month of its release. (The service has about 160 million subscribers.) It also touted the dramatic mystery \u201cUnbelievable\u201d as garnering 32 million households during that period. The numbers are not verified by outside sources.\n\nBut it remains to be seen what effect Netflix will feel in the weeks ahead when customers also begin paying monthly bills for Apple and Disney. Apple TV+ launches in two weeks with a slate of prestige original shows while Disney+ follows about two weeks later with a rich library of content from the likes of Marvel and Pixar. At $4.99 and $6.99, respectively, both services are priced significantly below Netflix\u2019s standard $12.99 package.\n\nAD\n\nNetflix chief product officer Greg Peters said in the call that he didn\u2019t worry about sticker shock. \u201cThe pricing of our competitors we don\u2019t feel is a real significant factor in determining what we can charge for our service,\u201d he said. \u201cThe service and the content are highly differentiated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStill, the company is expecting U.S. subscriber growth to slow, and will look to growth around the world to offset it. Hastings said U.S. domestic growth this year is expected to be only half what it has been previously, about 2.5 million instead of previous years\u2019 5 million.\n\nNetflix said it expected 7.6 million more subscribers in the fourth quarter, for a total addition of 26.7 million global subscribers in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nNetflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos said he believed the fourth quarter could be a good one for the service -- despite the competition -- thanks to its beefed-up movie slate.\n\n\u201cJust in the fourth quarter alone we\u2019re talking about films that range from massive-scale action films from Michael Bay to Oscar hopefuls like \u2018The Irishman,\u2019 \u2018Marriage Story\u2019 and \u2018Two Popes\u2019 to Eddie Murphy\u2019s return in \u2018Dolemite.\u2019 These are big theatrically ambitious type films that you\u2019ll be able to watch on Netflix,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is a fundamental change in the economics of how people enjoy films.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStill, the 2019 number will be below the 28.6 million additional subscribers the company racked up last year \u2014 and marks a shift from Netflix\u2019s previous expectation it would exceed that figure in 2019. Part of the reason, it said, was \u201cnew forthcoming competition.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe landscape will only get harsher for Netflix in 2020, as Warner Media\u2019s HBO Max and Comcast\u2019s Peacock service will launch in the first half of the year. Those services will offer shows such as \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d \u2014 for years Netflix consumers\u2019 favorites. Netflix has responded by spending $500 million dollars for \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and committing billions to new content for 2020.\n\nMany analysts believe Netflix can remain in the pole position and thrive despite Disney\u2019s new offering. But the combination of Apple, HBO Max and Peacock 's entry into the steaming market, they say, could begin to chip away at Netflix\u2019s dominance.\n\nAD\n\nNetflix sought to downplay the threat posed by the new services.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe upcoming arrival of services like Disney+, Apple TV+, HBO Max, and Peacock is increased competition, but we are all small compared to linear TV,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cWhile the new competitors have some great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.\u201c\n\nIt also acknowledged \u201csome modest headwind to our near-term growth\u201d as a result of the competition but said that in the long term \u201cwe expect we\u2019ll continue to grow nicely given the strength of our service and the large market opportunity.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Netflix looks strong, but pitfalls await", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/U6FaIAzArQF2nRCy2oH02pSk3aA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B22H4BHQHEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
