Researchers sourced bird data from scientific studies, multi-decade population surveys and bird-watching databases.\n\nThe simulations showed 389 out of 604 species will be without suitable habitat \u2014 threatened with extinction as a result of range loss \u2014 by 2100 should Earth\u2019s climate warm by 3 degrees Celsius.\n\nIf steps aren\u2019t taken to reduce climate change, Yarnold warned, the reality could be worse than the model\u2019s predictions.\n\n\u201cBirds are hardy and unpredictable, and this model is inherently conservative,\u201d Yarnold said. \u201cSome birds are likely to adapt in ways we can\u2019t foresee. Some birds are likely to thrive in warmer climate.\u201d\n\nBut most birds won\u2019t thrive. In fact, birds are already suffering at the hands of climate change and other human-caused environmental threats, according to scientists.\n\nLast month, a paper published in Science reported North America\u2019s bird population has experienced a loss of 2.9 billion breeding adults since 1970. Those loses are likely to continue as warming temperatures shrink the ranges of vulnerable species.\n\nAccording to the latest report from the Audobon Society, as many as 75 percent of the vulnerable species could be spared their fate if global warming can be contained to a rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2014 the target set by United Nations scientists.\n\nBecause birds can migrate and disperse more easily than other species, they are often better able to adapt than other animals. If climate change is already affecting birds, the consequences are certain to be worse for other less-mobile animals.\n\n\u201cBirds are important indicator species, because if an ecosystem is broken for birds, it is or soon will be for people too,\u201d Brooke Bateman, the senior climate scientist for the National Audubon Society, said in a news release. \u201cWhen I was a child, my grandmother introduced me to the common loons that lived on the lake at my grandparent\u2019s home in northern Wisconsin. Those loons are what drive my work today and I can\u2019t imagine them leaving the U.S. entirely in summer but that\u2019s what we\u2019re facing if trends continue.\u201d\n\nThe common loon is one of several species that has already seen its summertime range shrink as a result of climate change.\n\nWhile the latest report offers forecasts for the end of the century, its authors suggest the impacts of global warming are already impacting North American birds.\n\n\u201cWe can see in birds, through their migration patterns and shrinking ranges, climate change is happening already,\u201d Yarnold said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s affecting the birds in own backyards.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just rising temperatures that will force birds to adapt, relocate or both. Vulnerable species will also have to deal with sea level rise, Great Lakes level changes, urbanization, cropland expansion, drought, extreme spring heat, wildfires and heavy rain.\n\nThe authors of the new study suggest there are steps everyone can take to reduce the risk facing North American birds species. In addition to reducing energy usage as home, people can advocate for clean energy development and policies designed to drive down carbon emissions. According to the authors, expanding protections for forests and wetlands can also help mitigate the impacts of climate change while providing vital habitat for birds.\n\n\u201cWe already know what we need to do to reduce global warming, and we already have a lot of the tools we need to take those steps. Now, what we need are more people committed to making sure those solutions are put into practice,\u201d said Renee Stone, vice president of climate for the National Audubon Society. \u201cOur elected officials at every level of government must hear from their constituents that this is a priority. Audubon is committed to protecting the places birds need now and in the future and taking action to address the root causes of climate change.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 10 (UPI) \u2014 \u201cThis is a bird emergency,\u201d David Yarnold, president and CEO of the National Audubon Society, said during a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
