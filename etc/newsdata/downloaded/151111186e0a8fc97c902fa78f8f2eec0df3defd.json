Security of critical infrastructure is a national imperative; security of data is essential \u2026 We are saying to them that we are absolutely willing and open to have them test our products and technology to demonstrate that they are safe, secure, and reliable,\" he said.\n\nSee also: Huawei's \"plan B\" smartphone OS: What it needs to succeed (TechRepublic)\n\nAccording to Lord, the company has taken this similar approach with the United Kingdom, and labelled the outcome between Huawei and the UK as \"hugely positive\".\n\nLord also reinforced how even though Huawei is a company based in China, not all technology components are manufactured in China.\n\n\"As a company of Chinese origins, many people imagine that our products are entirely produced in China from Chinese components and suppliers, but nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"Huawei also spends heavily on components from Taiwan and South Korea as well as several European countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Finland.\n\n\"These components range from complex chipsets to the most basic nuts and bolts, and there are ample opportunities for Australian companies to play a far greater role in this supply chain. And Huawei is not unique. All of our competitors have similar supply chains, and Australia at this time, participates well below its capability.\"\n\nDuring his address, Lord also noted on the flip side, Australia needs to work on being an attractive market for investors by equipping its labour force with relevant skills.\n\n\"If we want to have an impact on the world stage and create the kind of mutually beneficial environment that we are talking about then we have to lift our game here and produce more STEM graduates that can add value to the global technology supply chain,\" he said.\n\n\"Finally, to put it succinctly, we need to let our universities grow, not shackle them.\"\n\nRelated Coverage", "description": "Huawei Australia chairman John Lord said Huawei is willing to allow the Australian government to test its products to make this happen.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/17/db36e634-77ad-4947-a6d7-d5162d03d5aa/thumbnail/770x578/0ff63db38acd5138544559c1ce1863f2/5g-and-huawei-mobile-networks-race-ahead-5d2c76fd14a4d60001be68bd-1-jul-17-2019-16-12-59-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
