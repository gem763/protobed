I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great!\u201d\n\nWesterhout was reportedly fired after bragging to reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, and that the president did not like being photographed with Tiffany because he perceived her as overweight, according to Politico.\n\nShe made the critical comments during an off-the-record dinner with reporters who were covering Trump\u2019s vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump told reporters on Friday that Westerhout explained to him she was \u201cdrinking\u201d at the time of the \u201churtful\u201d comments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was with reporters and everything she said was off the record,\u201d Trump said on Friday, one day after Westerhout\u2019s departure from the White House.\n\nTrump is currently suing \u201cvarious people\u201d for breaching confidentiality agreements, he said in a second tweet, including Omarosa Manigault-Newman, a former Trump aide and the director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison. She left the White House in December 2017.\n\n\u201cDisgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also!\u201d\n\nLast August, Trump\u2019s campaign arm filed a complaint with an arbitrator, accusing Omarosa of violating a 2016 confidentiality agreement with her tell-all book \u201cUnhinged,\u201d in which she was fiercely critical of Trump. In the agreement, Omarosa reportedly promised not to disparage Trump or disclose private information.\n\nIn her book, she claimed that she \u201crefused\u201d to sign a non-disclosure agreement upon her exit from the Trump White House. However, Trump disagreed in a tweet, saying that \u201cWacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Westerhout was reportedly fired after bragging to reporters that she had a better relationship with Trump than his own daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/trump.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
