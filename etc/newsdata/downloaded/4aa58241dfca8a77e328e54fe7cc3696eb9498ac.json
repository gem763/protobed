The company has also been investing in more labour intensive food and coffee business.\n\nTotal sales rose 7.4% to 1.82 billion pounds, while like-for-like sales rose by 6.8%, with a jump in bar and food sales.\n\n\u201cDespite continuing political problems ... Wetherspoon continues to perform well. Like-for-like sales for the six weeks to 8 September 2019 were up 5.9%,\u201d Chairman Tim Martin said in a statement.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance comes at a time when UK\u2019s pub sector is brimming with deals. Rival Greene King (GNK.L) is set to be bought by Hong-Kong\u2019s Ck Asset (1113.HK) for 4.6 billion pounds, while Slug and Lettuce pub chain owner Stonegate has agreed to buy Ei Group (EIGE.L) for 1.27 billion pounds.\n\nGreene King said earlier this year that a wet summer and poor sentiment had hurt its sales in its new financial year, after reporting a higher-than-expected annual profit in the previous 12 months.", "description": "Britain's J D Wetherspoon reported a higher annual pretax profit on Friday as more Britons visited its pubs even though overall consumer confidence and spending came under pressure due to Brexit uncertainties.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
