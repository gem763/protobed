At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people. You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\n\nCiting the contrast between Johnson\u2019s repeated assurances that he wants a deal, and the substance of his proposals, Tusk said: \u201cYou don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke. Quo vadis? [Where are you going?]\u201d\n\nScotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was also unimpressed.\n\nNicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) The UK government\u2019s attempt to shift the blame for the Brexit fiasco to anyone but themselves - today it\u2019s Merkel - is pathetically transparent.\n\nThe Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, struck a strident tone, suggesting the UK now had a choice between \u201ca clean break Brexit\u201d or \u201cto stay in a new militarised empire\u201d.\n\nNigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) No British Government could ever accept Germany telling us that part of the UK has to stay in the EU.\n\n\n\nThe choice now is clear: A clean break Brexit, or stay in a new militarised empire.\n\n\n\nTime to choose freedom.\n\nThe Brexit party\u2019s recent party political broadcast included a section that heavily implied the withdrawal agreement negotiated between Theresa May and EU, upon which it said Boris Johnson would base his deal, signed the country up for military cooperation. It also incorrectly called into question the UK\u2019s ability to unilaterally declare war.\n\nEarlier, responding to the unofficial No 10 briefing published on James Forsyth\u2019s Spectator blog, which implied the UK might withhold security cooperation from EU countries that backed a Brexit extension, the Green party\u2019s Caroline Lucas described the government\u2019s position as \u201cas close to blackmail as it gets\u201d.\n\nCaroline Lucas (@CarolineLucas) This is as close to blackmail as it gets\n\n\n\nNot content with being determined to destroy UK businesses, jobs etc, Govt now threatens to sabotage the EU\n\n\n\nThis is no way to secure a #Brexit deal, and proof that the Govt doesn't want one pic.twitter.com/C8NxZ9i6WU\n\nThe Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, issued more of a dissenting line to the bellicose no-deal rhetoric, saying that \u201cany threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable.\u201d.\n\nJulian Smith MP (@JulianSmithUK) I am clear that any threat on withdrawing security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable. This is not in the interest of NI or the Union.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow defence secretary was also unequivocal on the matter of security cooperation.", "description": "Leaders on both sides of Channel react angrily to suggestion Brexit deal looks impossible", "authors": ["Martin Belam"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53298fc0423d7a08798729ed1399a521dc00800c/366_0_3810_2287/master/3810.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed77bba7a51d1df447804280decc3965", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
