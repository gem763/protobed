In 2018, when Padma Kuppa challenged a Republican state representative, she homed in on the GOP\u2019s role in undermining public education and won, claiming a seat in Troy, an affluent suburban district north of Detroit that Democrats had never held before. Suburban districts like the one in Troy regularly top \u201cbest schools in Michigan\u201d lists, with high test scores and graduation rates, and loads of AP offerings. \u201cPeople here like their public schools, regardless of what party they belong to,\u201d Kuppa said. The GOP\u2019s steady expansion of a largely unregulated charter school sector has very little to offer voters in communities like hers.\n\nMatt Koleszar, a high school social studies and English teacher, won his race for state representative in suburban Plymouth with a message of what he describes as \u201ctenacious support for public schools.\u201d His call for adequate school funding resonated in this \u201cpurple\u201d district, he told me, but so did tying his opponent, Jeff Noble, to Betsy DeVos. Noble had scored an endorsement from the education advocacy group DeVos founded, and raised thousands from her extended family. In 2018, he even backed a controversial law to give charter schools a cut of any property tax increases at the county level. \u201cWhen I went door to door, explaining to people that this meant that their taxes were going to some for-profit charter school headquarters that\u2019s not even in the district, they were outraged,\u201d Koleszar said.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan to keep Michigan in his column includes luring back suburban voters who defected in 2018. His chief campaigner in Michigan, the new head of the state GOP, Laura Cox, should know as much; she lost her suburban Senate seat to a Democratic challenger, a teacher who\u2019d never run for office before, and who had campaigned on a promise to give more money to public schools. For now, however, Cox and the state GOP seem as cozy with the DeVos family\u2014and as addicted to their money\u2014as ever.\n\nThat relationship could backfire on Trump not only in Michigan\u2019s suburbs, but also in rural areas, where the GOP\u2019s education policies have even less to offer voters. There, the local schools are foundational community institutions, and the conservative push to privatize public services has transferred bus drivers, janitors, cafeteria workers, and even some coaches on to the payroll of private contractors that pay less than the state does while providing fewer benefits. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve gutted all of the insurance for these jobs, they\u2019re not that attractive,\u201d said Keith Smith, the superintendent of schools in rural Kingsley, Michigan. Cuts have forced school districts like his to ax \u201cextras,\u201d such as music, counseling, and the vocational programs that prepare students to work in skilled trades.\n\nIn July, when CNBC released its annual list of the \u201cbest states for doing business,\u201d Michigan had dropped 13 places. The state\u2019s schools are now so underfunded that they are no longer churning out the qualified graduates that investors look for when starting a new business. \u201cWe\u2019re like the frog in the water that\u2019s getting warmer and warmer,\u201d said Rob Fowler, the CEO of the trade group representing 27,000 of Michigan\u2019s small businesses. Last year, he and Business Leaders for Michigan convened an ambitious effort called Launch Michigan to bring together key stakeholders, in its parlance\u2014businesses, philanthropic organizations, and teachers\u2019 unions\u2014and fix what ails the state\u2019s schools. But beneath its buzzwords and hopeful calls for unity is sharper stuff. The business community has been a reliable cheerleader for the GOP and its legislative priorities; now, that alliance is fraying. In the coming months, Launch Michigan will present specific recommendations to the state legislature, urging policymakers to change course on such controversial topics as school funding and charter school oversight, keeping the GOP\u2019s dismal track record on education in the news as the 2020 balloting nears.", "description": "The president needs to win Michigan again, but many of his supporters there hate the education secretary.", "authors": ["Jennifer C.
