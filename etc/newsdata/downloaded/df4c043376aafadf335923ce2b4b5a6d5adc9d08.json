President Trump is right to refuse to raise the white flag of surrender.\n\nThankfully, few expect a shooting war to erupt between China and the U.S. Instead, our two countries are waging economic warfare, with trade policy being central to the battle. And like escalation in a shooting war, hostile actions taken by one side in our trade war with China will typically prompt the other to retaliate.\n\nThat\u2019s why when China announced Friday that it would increase tariffs on $75 billion in imports from the U.S., President Trump was right to respond the same day.\n\nCAROL ROTH: YES, TRUMP SHOULD BE TOUGH ON CHINA, BUT THE TARIFF ROUTE IS THE ROAD TO DISASTER\n\n\"Starting on October 1st, the 250 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, currently being taxed at 25 percent, will be taxed at 30 percent,\" Trump tweeted after China hit the U.S. with higher tariffs. \"Additionally, the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China, that was being taxed from September 1st at 10 percent, will now be taxed at 15 percent.\"\n\nSome Trump critics are saying America should back off this fight. They argue that Trump shouldn\u2019t take on a rising China, because bilateral trade benefits both nations and because tariffs will hit U.S. consumers and businesses with higher prices and destroy American jobs. Some even warn the trade war could lead to a dangerous and deadly military confrontation.\n\nI say the Trump critics are wrong.\n\nThe Trump administration has now set on a course to ensure that whenever Beijing acts like a rogue regime there will be costs.\n\nIn fact, now is the time for the U.S. to push back against China for years of trade violations, intellectual property theft and unreasonable demands that past American presidents have complained about but failed to do anything about.\n\nIt\u2019s about time we finally have someone in the White House who is bold enough to take on the China challenge and has the right foreign policy ideas to do it.\n\nPresident Trump is fond of calling his brand of foreign policy \u201cAmerica First.\u201d This policy is really a matter of simple common sense. America \u2013 like every other nation \u2013 should place its own interests and those of its citizens ahead of other nations or secondary concerns.\n\nThat means that China must be confronted and stood up to, like the international bully it is has become.\n\nFaced with a policy of weakness and appeasement when President Obama was in office, China\u2019s power, economic might and military muscle grew exponentially in the eight years before President Trump took office. If Trump simply continued the Obama policies, China would grow stronger still at U.S. expense.\n\nFor Trump, there is simply no other choice. There will be costs in the form of higher prices for products American buy and we will suffer because of reduced exports to China due to the tariff increases. But in the long run, these costs are worth short-term pain to achieve long-term gain.\n\nIf only President Obama had stood up to a rising China starting in 2009, President Trump would not be in the position that he is in today of asking the American people to make some tough sacrifices.\n\nClearly, Obama had ample opportunities to put Beijing on notice. For example:\n\nObama did nothing to match or deter China from building an awesome military machine. China developed weapons that can sink U.S. Navy aircraft carriers, along with missiles that can destroy most U.S. bases throughout Asia and negate the military capabilities or our allies. Instead of spending more on defense, Obama cut military spending to the bone \u2013 something Trump has had to correct at great cost.\n\nObama failed to stop China from making territorial claims all throughout Asia. Whether it was in the South or East China Sea, over Taiwan or over small islands and reefs, China\u2019s goal was to turn the broader Asia-Pacific into its very own giant sphere of influence. In response, Obama proclaimed a so-called \u201cpivot to Asia.\u201d The pivot sounded great, but never happened. It was under-resourced, devoid of any strategy and accomplished nothing. China pushed even harder in the face of Obama\u2019s weakness, building islands to cement its claims in the South China Sea and constructing military bases.\n\nObama did nothing after China hacked the U.S. government\u2019s Office of Management and Budget. China stole an astounding 23 million personnel records of federal workers \u2013 including many who work in the national security and intelligence establishment.\n\nObama failed to respond when China broke World Trade Organization rules. China gave hundreds of billions of dollars of illegal subsidies to domestic industries to try and dominate the global economy. Named Made in China 2025, this initiative was designed to ensure that China\u2019s electric cars, solar panels, 5G equipment and artificial intelligence technologies not only dominate the Chinese domestic market, but the global economy. At the same time, China \u2013 along with its state-owned enterprises \u2013 used all sorts of methods to steal U.S. intellectual property worth hundreds of billions of dollars through cyberespionage or making access to the Chinese market contingent on getting access to such information.\n\nWhile the above list is far from complete, the point is clear: the Chinese government is a bad actor that has gained from aggressive behavior that enhances its power at the expense of others \u2013 especially the United States.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Trump administration has now set on a course to ensure that whenever Beijing acts like a rogue regime there will be costs.\n\nThe American people should know, as the president has tried to explain, that this test of wills could cost them economically. The good news is that the American people know their history and understand the need for shared sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nAn earlier generation of American leaders stood up to the Axis powers in World War II when they tried to dominate the world. Then American presidents stood up the Soviet Union during the Cold War. And most recently, our leaders began the fight against international terrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow President Trump is standing up to China\u2019s efforts to dominate the 21st century through economic, military and diplomatic thuggery. He deserves the support of every American, regardless of political party, in this vital endeavor.\n\nNothing can beat an America that is united under one goal and a common vision. China needs to understand that, or learn the lesson the hard way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARRY KAZIANIS", "description": "China is an international bully that wants to shape the future of the world.
