A sturdy case or sleeve goes a long way to keep your laptop safe from accidental damage. To find out which cases are best for different types of users, we asked some stylish people in tech as well as three computer-repair experts who know all too well the dangers of not using a case.\n\nBest hard-shell cases\n\nHDE Clear MacBook Pro 13-inch Case A hard-shell case, which attaches to your laptop, protects against dents and scratches without any added bulk. It can work on its own for daily use, or serve as an added layer of protection if you\u2019re carrying your laptop in another bag (like one of the backpacks or messenger bags below). Benson Chou, founder of Work Hard Anywhere, a community and app for freelancers, likes that he can customize these basic HDE cases with stickers, changing them up as the mood strikes. \u201cI think this solution not only helps with protecting the laptop, but also gives me the flexibility to change my mind often.\u201d Chou adds that the very affordable hard-plastic case is \u201ckeeping my laptop scratch free.\u201d $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest laptop sleeves\n\nMosiso Water Repellent Lycra Sleeve Bag Lopez recommends that people look for \u201ccases made specifically for their make or model laptop,\u201d especially since a snug fit is essential. He says Mosiso cases work well for Macs as they come in very specific sizes (like 13.3 inches and 15.6 inches) that line up with Apple\u2019s laptop measurements. This case also includes an extra pouch for storing a charger. $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nHerschel Supply Co. Anchor 13-Inch MacBook Sleeve Although Tse says this sleeve (from teen-favorite backpack-maker Herschel Supply Co.) offers \u201cnothing crazy in terms of features,\u201d it\u2019s one of his top picks for day-to-day protection since it\u2019s got plenty of padding and lasts a long time. $40 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nElvis & Kresse Folio & Laptop Case For something a little more unique, Muchaneta Kapfunde, who blogs about the intersection of tech and design at FashNerd, recommends this sleeve, which is actually made from recycled fire hoses. Kapfunde likes that the British company that makes it, Elvis & Kresse, is \u201csustainable, ethical, and transparent,\u201d and says the durable cases (they\u2019re lined with reclaimed parachute silk) are worth the price. $103 at Elvis & Kresse Buy\n\nBest extra-tough laptop cases\n\nThule Gauntlet 3.0 15\u201d MacBook Pro Retina Sleeve $57 (was $60, now 5% off) For situations where you\u2019ll need extra protection \u2014 like putting your laptop in a checked suitcase that\u2019ll likely get jostled in transport \u2014 Ham says \u201cyou want a hard-shell bag or at least a bag with stiff corners. The hard shell will better insulate the laptop from rougher conditions.\u201d Tse likes Thule\u2019s rugged and dependable cases for \u201cheavy-duty\u201d protection. This one has a rigid exterior for insulating your computer from outside impact and a soft, padded interior to prevent the case from scratching or denting your laptop. $57 at Amazon Buy $57 at Amazon Buy\n\nNacuwa Protective Laptop Case Computer Sleeve $29 (was $59, now 51% off) Ham suggests this durable case with multiple inner pockets \u201cto protect against jostling, banging around, and shaking,\u201d but also adds that an extra layer of padding (like clothing in a suitcase) \u201cwould help with sharp impacts.\u201d $29 at Amazon Buy $29 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest waterproof laptop case\n\nAqua Quest Storm Waterproof Laptop Sleeve One of the most common causes of broken laptops is water damage. \u201cLaptop cases are usually thrown in backpacks and will easily get wet from drinks,\u201d says Joe Silverman, founder and CEO of New York Computer Help. \u201cBeing waterproof will protect against damaging liquid spills.\u201d He recommends the Aqua Quest Storm case because it\u2019s completely waterproof and also padded for extra protection. $35 at Amazon Buy $35 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest laptop messenger bags\n\nManhattan Portage 13-Inch Deluxe Computer Bag As Lopez points out, students\u2019 laptops are \u201cthe \u2018hub\u2019 of their portable office \u2014 their book bag,\u201d so many often look for laptop-friendly (a.k.a. protective) bags with lots of pockets for computer accessories, books, pens, notebooks, and whatever else they\u2019ll need throughout the day. This Manhattan Portage bag, his pick for college students, features a number of compartments, including four pockets underneath the front flap for items that need to be accessed easily, and a padded laptop sleeve. $79 at Amazon Buy $79 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest laptop backpacks\n\nKopack Slim Business Laptop Backpack $33 (was $41, now 20% off) If you prefer using a backpack to tote your laptop from class to class (or between home and the office), Silverman says to look for one that \u201cis waterproof, padded, has compartments for books, and charges phones on the fly.\u201d He says this Kopack backpack \u2014 which we\u2019ve singled out before as one of the best-reviewed laptop backpacks on Amazon \u2014 does all of these things and more. A detachable USB port keeps your phone charged all day, and a lockable zipper on the hidden laptop compartment helps prevent theft. $33 at Amazon Buy $33 at Amazon Buy\n\nTopo Designs Travel Bag 30L Sean Kelly, a lead product designer for stylish desk-accessory brand Grovemade, likes this Topo Designs bag, especially for keeping his laptop and tablet from banging against each other. \u201c[The bag] has a padded back pocket for the laptop, which I can access from its own opening on the outside of the pack, and there is an interior pocket that fits my iPad and keeps it well protected without needing a case,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact the pack has so many wonderfully placed compartments that I can keep all my gear separated so it is organized [and] easy to find.\u201d $189 at Zappos Buy\n\nThule Pack \u2018n Pedal Commuter Backpack Students and office workers who commute by bike need a laptop backpack that\u2019ll stand up to the elements, as well as potholes or other bumps in the road.
