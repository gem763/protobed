Little clarity could be found on the subject during Tuesday night\u2019s Democrat presidential debate , during which the candidates energetically criticized President Donald Trump, but grew vague and evasive when asked to describe the situation in Syria or explain how they would handle it.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden boasted about how much time he spent in the White House on foreign policy and Syria for a while, then seemingly threatened to declare war on Turkey, something neither he nor any other Democrat would actually do if they became president:\n\nI would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad\u2019s people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they\u2019re in, they\u2019ll only go to Europe and won\u2019t affect us. It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history \u2014 excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I\u2019ve never seen a time \u2014 and I\u2019ve spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I\u2019ve spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what\u2019s happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he\u2019s going to have a problem \u2014 because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he\u2019s going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.\n\nNote that there is no evidence of the Syrian army firing at American troops, but Biden might have been confusing Syrian with Turkish forces, which have reportedly fired uncomfortably close to American positions in Iraq.\n\nA real journalist would have pointed out to Biden that some of the Syrian groups his administration told us were reliable \u201cwhite hat\u201d military allies have joined the Turks to attack the Kurds and asked how he failed to discern the true nature of those groups during the \u201cthousands of hours\u201d he boasted of spending in the White House Situation Room, but fortunately for Biden, CNN does not employ anyone who would ask a question like that of a Democrat.\n\nThe only candidate who did not try to stuff herself into a war hawk costume at the debate was Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), who got to speak next, and challenged both Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Mayor Pete Buttigieg on their positions.\n\nGabbard has her own issues when it comes to Syria \u2014 which she attempted to deal with by denying that she has been a \u201cRussian asset\u201d or \u201cAssad apologist\u201d \u2014 and she professed to have qualms about President Trump\u2019s sudden pullout from the Turkish border region, but she described the Turkish attack on the Kurds as \u201cyet another negative consequence of the regime change war we\u2019ve been waging in Syria,\u201d a war the media was \u201cchampioning and cheerleading\u201d throughout the Obama administration.\n\nGabbard said she would take two steps on Syria: ending sanctions against the Assad regime \u201cthat are really a modern-day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,\u201d and ending U.S. support for Syrian rebel forces, some of which are linked to terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. Neither of those steps would ameliorate Turkey\u2019s concerns in any way or persuade it to halt its invasion of Syria.\n\nGabbard taunted Warren about living up to the anti-war stance she took so ostentatiously during the second Bush administration. Warren, boxed into a corner, had nothing meaningful to say beyond vague platitudes about getting out of the Middle East \u201cthe smart way\u201d and complaints about Trump helping ISIS \u201cget another foothold, a new lease on life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this. I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region,\u201d Warren said.\n\nTurkey certainly seems to think there is a \u201cmilitary solution\u201d to its security concerns, having worked for years to obtain a \u201cnegotiated solution\u201d without satisfactory results. Russia and Iran somehow found a \u201cmilitary solution\u201d to the Syrian civil war.\n\nCNN moved very quickly along to Buttigieg, who was allowed to simultaneously claim he opposes \u201cendless wars\u201d but also call for an endless American presence in the worst quagmire on the planet.\n\nButtigieg, a military veteran, abandoned years of Democrat Party dogma about Afghanistan being the \u201cgood war\u201d to argue that Syria is the only place American troops should be stationed.\n\n\u201cLook, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said.\n\nButtigieg claimed pulling out of Syria would be \u201ctaking away what makes America America\u201d and would make \u201cthe world a more dangerous place,\u201d which oddly enough is exactly the opposite of what Democrats said when they urged a pullout from Iraq. They used to get very angry at people who implied their criticism of the Iraq deployment would be \u201ctaking away what makes America America.\u201d They routinely portrayed American soldiers in Iraq as helpless victims of the insurgency whose lives were being squandered.\n\nGabbard jumped in and called Buttigieg out on his claim to oppose endless wars while \u201ccontinuing to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war,\u201d a policy that involves \u201cproviding arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like al-Qaeda, HTS, al-Nusra and others.\u201d\n\nButtigieg never answered her question. Instead, he claimed he would not be able to look Afghan civilians or soldiers in the eye after Trump\u2019s pullout from Syria, which is funny because not three minutes earlier he said he wanted to pull out from Afghanistan.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) refused to say whether he would support kicking Turkey out of NATO but insisted Turkey should no longer be seen as a U.S. ally \u201cwhen they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) evaded the same question about NATO membership, condemning Turkey\u2019s actions as \u201coutrageous\u201d and a \u201chorror\u201d but advising continued engagement and negotiations with Turkey.\n\nSenator Kamala Harris (D-CA) said Trump endangered U.S. national security by \u201cbasically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get-out-of-jail-free card\u201d and making the Islamic State one of the \u201cbig winners\u201d in Syria, in addition to Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime. It appears to have escaped her notice that the latter three were already the \u201cbig winners\u201d in Syria before Trump\u2019s election, even though she boasted of sitting on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where such things are presumably discussed.\n\nBiden came back to wrap up the Syria section of the debate with a characteristically disjointed rant about how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u201cunderstands if he\u2019s out of NATO, he\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d but also efforts to break up NATO are the demonic work of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cAnd with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border,\u201d Biden insisted, forgetting that President Obama explicitly stated Assad had to go, and a very large number of innocent people were indeed \u201cwiped out\u201d or driven out of Syria on his and Obama\u2019s watch.\n\nBiden\u2019s rambling closer typifies the problem the Democrats face on Syria: All of them, with the exception of no-hope candidate Tulsi Gabbard, want to virtue-signal as loud as they can and slam President Trump as hard as possible, but none of them wants to discuss the details of what has been happening in Syria since 2011 or propose a cogent strategy for changing conditions on the ground in a meaningful way. None of them talked about an \u201cexit strategy,\u201d a phrase they were very big on during the Iraq operation.\n\nNone of the Democrats wanted to discuss Turkey\u2019s claims of a severe security threat from northeastern Syria, discuss why the international community did nothing to address those claims, or explain why the United States was held solely responsible for preventing Turkey from taking action. They treated the notion of Russian and Syrian involvement against the Turkish assault as inherently outrageous without explaining why the Syrian government should not be held responsible for protecting its own citizens and securing its own borders. They complained about escaping ISIS prisoners without discussing why thousands of them were still parked in Kurdish prison camps and how long they should be left there.\n\nNone of the Democrats was asked to present a war plan for fighting Turkey or discuss how much the U.S. depends on Turkish bases for operations in the Middle East. None of them, not even Biden, was pressed on how the Obama administration set the table for current events. None of them acknowledged the difficulty of getting reliable information from any party involved in the savage Syrian civil war, although Gabbard came close when she pointed out how dodgy some of the groups supported by the Obama administration were.\n\nAnd of course, CNN would not dream of asking the Democrat candidates \u2014 several of whom are sitting senators \u2014 why their caucus did not authorize military force against Turkey to protect the Kurds, instead spending all of its time on an impeachment crusade against President Trump. Trump said he wanted to pull troops out of Syria almost a year ago, and Erdogan was threatening to invade long before that. The Democrats had plenty of time to pass the appropriate congressional resolutions and send a strong message to Turkey, but that would have involved putting real political capital on the line instead of sniping from the sidelines.", "description": "Little clarity on murky, war-torn Syria could be found during Tuesday night\u2019s Democrat presidential debate.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/debate-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
