Mr Cronin threatened to take legal action against Scopa for this.\n\n\"Scopa will not be threatened or hindered in its work by anyone,\" said Godi.\n\n\"Scopa will not relent in its demand for transparency and accountability for public funds.\"\n\nHe said it was unprecedented that a member of the executive \"placed on record\" a threat to take Parliament to court for doing its work.\n\n\"The Department of Public Works remains a department under siege from corrupt employees working in cahoots with external interests. Scopa will relentlessly pursue these crooks,\" Godi charged.", "description": "Minister of Public Works Thulas Nxesi has accused the watchdog committee of instituting a \"highly compromised\" process which is part of a \"fightback by corrupt syndicates\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8094/cf385de9eb964f9eb8923d488a8bbfcb.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-27"}
