In real terms, over the course of their contract Liverpool\u2019s deal with Nike will be worth far more than the \u00a345m a year they currently receive.", "description": "Liverpool have been given the go-ahead to sign a lucrative new kit deal with Nike after winning a high court challenge about their plans to ditch current suppliers New Balance.", "authors": ["Chris Bascombe", "Sam Dean", "Jamie Carragher", "Fiona Tomas"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000213999884-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqLiZnSJs8x6dOfuqFtiWqEbEu4odvKfIxFVccPQZWyAc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
