She endorsed a primary challenger against one of her own colleagues and hobnobs with Republicans at least as much as she does with her own caucus. Kyrsten Sinema doesn\u2019t really fit in with her fellow Senate Democrats. Don\u2019t even ask her whether she watches the Democratic presidential debates. \u201cI\u2019m not missing anything. I prefer happiness,\u201d Sinema declares in a 25-minute interview, a rare extended conversation with an outlet not based in Arizona. \u201cLook how happy I am.\u201d\n\nPolitics have become so hyperpartisan and the Democrats so progressive that the article notes that Sinema's \"radical breed of centrism could be a headache for the party.\"\n\nThe radicals are mainstream and the moderates are radical, got it?\n\nI moved back to Arizona several months before Sinema was elected and I obviously didn't vote for her, but have to say that I have been surprised by her so far, largely because she's not a raging progressive. She's an anomaly in a time when most Democrats are lurching so far leftward that they couldn't find the center using GPS and Sherpa guides.\n\nThis is a very lengthy article about Sinema and is interesting for the fact that she is of such interest simply because she's flying under the radar, getting along with Republicans, and avoiding the impeachment drama.\n\nThe Democrats have spent ten months lionizing a big-mouthed former bartender who has IQ of dryer lint.\n\nCalm and thoughtful isn't really what they're after these days.\n\nThe Liberals Are Here Early to Ruin Christmas This Year\n\nKelly Clarkson and the always-overrated John Legend have teamed up to do an updated version of \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" a song that the PC SJW crowd deemed to be an ode to date rape a few years ago.\n\nLet's all get into the holiday spirit by doing everything we can to make sure that these lunatic leftists are never in charge of anything again.\n\nLOL Also Totally Believable\n\nJared Kushner: \"A lot of the work that the President's had me doing over the last 3 years has actually been cleaning up the messes that Vice President Biden left behind.\" pic.twitter.com/Y9ncHOXkrd \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 29, 2019\n\nPJM Linktank\n\nVodkaPundit: Air Force to Test Lighter, Cheaper, Planes to Supplement the A-10\n\nSleazeball's gonna sleazeball: Adam Schiff Accused of Witness Tampering in 'Soviet-Style' Impeachment Inquiry\n\nOne that is no doubt smarter than he is: Joe Biden's Latest Pitch to Voters: He Owns a Dog\n\nLiberals hate families: Austin's New Sex-Ed Curriculum Tells Kids Not to Call Parents 'Mom' or 'Dad'\n\nWhy Is YouTube Protecting the Southern Poverty Law Center?\n\nFrom the Mothership and Beyond\n\nDid Bernie Get A Poll Bounce From AOC\u2019s Endorsement?\n\nBonus Schlichter: The Coming War Over Kinky Katie Hill\u2019s Congressional Seat\n\n#TrueStory: Media Can't Stand Trump Winning -- Ever\n\nVermont Governor To Face Primary Challenge After Gun Control Support\n\nSuicides Are Going Up, Not Down, In States With \u201cRed Flag\u201d Laws\n\n\"McCain and Flake\" with an all-female cast: Collins, Murkowski Won\u2019t Co-Sponsor Graham\u2019s Resolution Criticizing House\u2019s Impeachment Process\n\nHalloween At The White House: All Treats, No Tricks, No Worries\n\nHmmm: Look Which State Has Gone Back To Hand-Marked Paper Ballots\n\nA second Democratic staffer has been sentenced in connection with that Kavanaugh doxxing case\n\n\u2018What a disgrace\u2019!
