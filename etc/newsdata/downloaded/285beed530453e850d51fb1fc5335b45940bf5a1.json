His walk through landmine-cleared area echoed his mother, Princess Diana, as she made a similar walk when she visited a mine field in Angola (that field has since been turned into a bustling street, so it's not the exact same area). Diana made headlines at the time, and her work was critical for establishing a worldwide ban on the explosive devices. Angola is working to be landmine-free by 2025.\n\nDuring his speech, Harry had a new message for the gathered crowd, speaking to one of the most important causes he's highlighted so far on the tour\u2014climate change. He said, \"By clearing the landmines we can help this community find peace and with peace comes opportunity. Eco tourism will bring more jobs to Angola in the future than its oil and gas industries.\" This feel so, so important to me, and an important update to the work his mother did. Royal reporter Kelly Matthews noted that Harry is 35, just the age Diana was when she made her trip.\n\nAccording to the Sussex Royal Instagram account, \"The Duke is humbled to be visiting a place and a community that was so special to his mother, and to recognise her tireless mission as an advocate for all those she felt needed her voice the most, even if the issue was not universally popular.\"\n\nThe account also used Diana's original quote in 1997: \"If an international ban on mines can be secured it means, looking far ahead, that the world may be a safer place for this generation's grandchildren.\"\n\nThey also shared shots of the event:\n\nAnd video, including of Harry remotely detonating a landmine:\n\nAs well as, of course, a picture of Diana:\n\nAnd reporters shared video of him walking down the exact place his mother did:\n\nThis is Prince Harry walking down the street in Huambo - exactly where his mother walked in that minefield nearly 23 years ago ... pic.twitter.com/iNAj3sItM7 \u2014 Chris Ship (@chrisshipitv) September 27, 2019\n\nReally sweet and wonderful.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "And he spoke about a new, critically important cause", "authors": ["Katherine J Igoe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/f7HMxvYIts0oq1Kq_Z7b1w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_865/757bbb53ab9f6ac92c11232fc1c14db7", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
