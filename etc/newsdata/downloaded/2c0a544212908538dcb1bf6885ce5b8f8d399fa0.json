Ed Rendell, a top surrogate for Biden, told The Daily Beast. \u201cI think the more you respond, the more you\u2019re playing into Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nRendell, who said was not involved in any discussions about the matter, wondered aloud about the thinking behind it, before doubling down. \u201cThere\u2019s a danger in playing Trump\u2019s game,\u201d he said bluntly.\n\nFor Team Biden, Hunter\u2019s Biden\u2019s interview, set to air on ABC News\u2019 \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d is an opportunity to clear the air and turn the attention back to the widespread corruption running rampant in the Trump White House. It will also give the younger Biden a chance to present facts in his own words to counter Trump\u2019s misinformation campaign.\n\n\u201cHow, when and the substance of this came directly from Hunter,\u201d a source familiar told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe campaign did not arrange this, but Hunter has been increasingly under attack in personal and vicious terms for the past couple of weeks from the president \u2014 all based on lies \u2014 and he made the decision to speak.\u201d\n\nRival campaigns weren\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cThis is insane that they would do it,\u201d a senior advisor to a Democratic opponent said.\n\nM ultiple aides to 2020 candidates found the timing suspect and speculated that Hunter Biden\u2019s move to go public automatically puts the debate moderators in a position that they can\u2019t ignore it on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cEveryone else had laid off of Joe Biden,\u201d the senior advisor added. \u201cNow that\u2019s all gone. I would bet $100 it\u2019s the first question. If it is, it\u2019s a major disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy even put it out there to answer for that?,\u201d another rival campaign aide asked. \u201cNow it\u2019s fair game that a moderator can bring it up.\u201d\n\nA third aide wondered why the whole thing was necessary at all: \u201cWhen I saw that I thought, why would you do that? There was no clamor to hear from Hunter directly.\u201d\n\nThe Westerville debate will be moderated by CNN anchors Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett and The New York Times\u2019 National Editor Marc Lacey. Biden will assume a center-stage spot, joining Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX), entrepreneur Andrew Yang, and mega-donor Tom Steyer, who will join for his first debate of the 2020 cycle.\n\nSome aides speculated that if it\u2019s not the moderators, debate wildcards Gabbard and Steyer may launch surprise attacks on the former vice president. Aides to two 2020 candidates said Biden\u2019s team should be prepared for a possible line of attack following Hunter Biden\u2019s interview that goes against the soft embrace he\u2019s enjoyed by other candidates thus far, and pointed to Gabbard and Steyer as the contenders most likely to go for it.\n\n\u201cI would be shocked if candidates lean in,\u201d one aide said, before tweaking their thought: \u201cMaybe Tulsi, maybe Steyer.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s son has been uncredibly accused, largely by the president and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, over unsubstantiated claims of misconduct tied to business dealings in Ukraine and China. Hunter Biden stepped down from the board of a private gas firm before his father launched his presidential bid over the spring, but that didn\u2019t stop the president from relentlessly unleashing attacks on his work. And over recent days, the narrative shifted to China. On Oct. 13, when Hunter Biden announced he would also step down from the board of the Chinese private equity company he served on, some outside observers saw the arrangement as ethically dubious.\n\nBut for the majority of Biden\u2019s fellow Democratic presidential contenders, the bigger issue was the timing behind it, just hours ahead of the debate. And while presidential contenders are highly unlikely to launch into attacks on Biden on stage, according to interviews with half a dozen aides advising their bosses for the event, questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s decision dominated private discussions on Monday ahead of the Ohio event.\n\nFor weeks, the Biden campaign was content to argue forcefully that the entire thing was a non-story \u2014 a controversy manufactured by Trump in order to appear that something was untoward when in reality the president and his children were engaged in something far worse. On Sunday night, Hunter Biden\u2019s lawyer George Mesires released his own statement.\n\n\u201cHunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, irrespective of its effects on Hunter\u2019s professional interests,\u201d Mesires said in a post on Medium. \u201cThis was the standard observed throughout Hunter\u2019s professional career.\u201d\n\nThen, Mesires detailed a new commitment on behalf of the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cUnder a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies,\u201d Mesires wrote.\n\nStill, not everyone was convinced the move was such a bad idea. One top aide to another presidential contender drew a parallel between what Biden\u2019s team is grappling with and a hurdle that previously plagued another campaign.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way Elizabeth Warren did it with her DNA test,\u201d the senior campaign aide said, referencing the Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s decision to preemptively release the results of a DNA test to show part of her heritage after being taunted for months by Trump. The move, widely panned at the time, has not stifled Warren\u2019s eventual assent to achieve co-frontrunner status with Biden.\n\n\u201cEveryone was like \u2018what\u2019s she doing?\u2019 But you know what, it worked.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have put Hunter on the air,\u201d former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, a top surrogate for Biden, told The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571103525/191014-trudo-hunter-biden-tease_xlkauu", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
