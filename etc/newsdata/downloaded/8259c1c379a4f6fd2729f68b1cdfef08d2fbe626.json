Meghan arrived at about 14:00, and the artists and designers displayed their work for Meghan.\n\nOne of the creatives, James Delaney, told Channel24 the duchess was \"polite, friendly and informal\".\n\n\"We had a friendly chat. I introduced myself as James, and she said: 'Hi, I'm Meghan'.\"\n\nThe duchess also received a special gift for Archie from local designer, Tshepo Mohlala.\n\n\"My team and I decided to honour her son with a cute dungaree, and it was her heart-warming reaction when I handed them to her that'll forever be etched in my memory.\"\n\nTshepo, who started his jeans brand in 2015, said, \"It was so beautiful seeing her maternal side come to life,\" and added that she was beaming with gratitude.\n\n(INSPIRED: Duchess Meghan meets with creatives in Victoria Yards.

Their Royal Highnesses were deeply inspired by young South Africans upskilling and doing whatever they can to contribute to their community.\n\nPrince Harry said, \"It's moments like today and meeting all of you, that inspires us.\n\n\"Whether supporting young entrepreneurs, empowering women and girls, or challenging the issue of gender-based violence; whether it's been planting trees, clearing landmines, or protecting the most beautiful creatures and places on the planet, these experiences have affirmed our love of Africa, and the issues that are so important to us.\n\n\"We will firmly stand up for what we believe. We are fortunate enough to have a position that gives us amazing opportunities, and we want to do all we can to play our part in building a better world.\n\n\"We will always seek to challenge injustice and to speak out for those who may feel unheard. So no matter your background, your nationality, your age or gender, your sexuality, your physical ability, no matter your circumstance or colour of your skin \u2013 we believe in you, and we intend to spend our entire lives making sure you have the opportunity to succeed \u2013 and to change the world.\"\n\n(TACKLING YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visit Tembisa during their royal tour of Africa.

Duchess Meghan said, \"We've met the most incredible people,\" describing South Africa as the most \"energising\" place.\n\n\"Even though it's a full schedule,\" she said of their tour, \"you just feel uplifted.\n\n\"It's been beautiful.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(REFLECTING: Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry spend the afternoon with Gra\u00e7a Machel.

She shared a lesson she learned while at Auawal Masjid in Bo-Kaap.\n\n\"One of the women told us that the way we change the world is to honour the dignity of difference.\n\n\"In this, we can find strength when we can bridge divides and meet as human beings with different experiences we can all find connection, and in that connection, we become more aware of one another, of our place in the world. We find hope, and self-worth, we can find optimism and courage \u2013 ultimately, we can find joy.\n\n\"So whether for Archie, Harry and Me in South Africa, or for my husband travelling through Botswana, Angola and Malawi, please know that you have given us so much inspiration, so much hope, and above all, you have given us joy.\"\n\n(GOODBYE: Meghan makes one last empowering speech.

In a video that may very well be the highlight of the entire tour, President Ramaphosa gushed over his cattle book with Harry and Meghan.\n\nHis Royal Highness revealed a beautifully framed photograph he'd brought as a gift for the president.\n\n\"Look at my cattle!\" Cyril said, turning the frame around and showing the cameras, before giving the royals his published work, Cattle of the Ages: Ankole cattle in South Africa.\n\n\"Wow,\" Harry said, while Meghan was genuinely taken with the gift. \"How amazing,\" she commented.\n\nPaging through the signed copy, the president said they are \"unbelievable cattle\", pointing to each and every photograph.\n\n\"That's me among the cattle!\" he said on one occasion. On another, he beamed, \"Look at how beautiful these cattle are. Look at their pose.\"\n\nWATCH THE PRECIOUS MOMENT HERE:", "description": "Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan concluded their tour of the African continent this week with a stop at the University of Johannesburg, a visit to a township and a meeting with President Ramaphosa.", "authors": ["Bashiera Parker", "Bparks_"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9312/e5a78e689e5949b69c278228ea313357.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
