Joseph Cress, Iowa City Press-Citizen\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa - A Waterloo high school teacher is on administrative leave after he left a threatening Facebook comment on a news story about climate activist Greta Thunberg's Iowa City visit Friday.\n\nMatt Baish, a science teacher at Waterloo West High School, posted \"Dont have my sniper rifle\" Thursday on an article shared from Little Village Magazine about Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl who has been a leading voice of youth activism around climate change.\n\nBaish's comment, in addition to his own Facebook page, appears to have been deleted. But screenshots of his comments were posted on the Waterloo Community School District Facebook page.\n\nThe teachers and students at West received a message about Baish on Friday, saying that he was put on leave, according to an email statement by Waterloo Schools director of school and community relations Tara Thomas.\n\n'Together, we are unstoppable': Greta Thunberg drives a Tesla to Iowa to join in student-led climate strike\n\n\"We are aware of a social media situation involving one of our employees,\" the statement said. \"The nature of the content shared rose to the level of putting this employee on administrative leave pending an investigation. We appreciate your patience as we sort through the details and thank you for respecting the process.\"\n\nWaterloo Police Lt. Kye Richter said law enforcement is also investigating the incident.\n\nThomas also shared the school district's social media policy, which includes guidelines prohibiting content that \"would be defined by a reasonable person as obscene, racist, or sexist,\" \"promotes illicit, illegal, or unethical activity\" or \"violates the district\u2019s affirmative action and/or bullying and harassment policies.\"\n\nSchool district employees can face consequences including suspension or dismissal for not following online conduct guidelines, according to the document.\n\nThunberg joined more than 3,000 activists at a climate strike on Friday afternoon in Iowa City. Strikers demanded the University of Iowa and the city agree to a \"Town-Gown Climate Accord,\" which calls for both entities to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2030 and asks the university to cease burning coal at its power plant.\n\n\"We teenagers and children shouldn't have to take the responsibility but right now the world leaders keep acting like children and someone needs to be the adult in the room,\" Thunberg said in Iowa City. \"The world is waking up. We are the change and change is coming whether they like it or not.\"\n\nHow the trolls go after Greta Thunberg: Online haters are targeting her with conspiracy theories and fake photos\n\nFollow Robin Opsahl on Twitter: @robinlopsahl\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/06/teacher-leave-sniper-rifle-comment-greta-thunberg/3893160002/", "description": "The high school science teacher wrote \"Dont have my sniper rifle\" on a post about Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist's visit to Iowa City.", "authors": ["Robin Opsahl", "Published P.M.
