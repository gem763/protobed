Well, Scotland-based distillery The Glenlivet, which produces single malt Scotch whiskey, has solved this problem with its newest product: the \"whisky cocktail pod.\"\n\nThe ice-less, stir-less and glass-less Capsule Collection was unveiled recently during London Cocktail Week, somewhat to the ire of Twitter.\n\nWHISKEY VS. WHISKY \u2014 WHAT\u2019S THE DIFFERENCE?\n\n\u201cAs a brand that celebrates originality, we are always looking to break the conventions that have determined how single malt Scotch has historically been enjoyed. The Glenlivet Capsule Collection does exactly that, and we\u2019re excited to see how people react when they try our glassless cocktails,\u201d Miriam Eceolaza, Director of The Glenlivet, said in a press release.\n\nThe capsule, which is described as the first of its kind for a spirit brand, is made of an edible, biodegradable seaweed-based material, and filled with 23 milliliters (.77 fluid ounces) of scotch. According to the press release, \u201cthe capsules are popped in the mouth for an instant burst of flavor, and the capsule is simply swallowed.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWhen The Glenlivet approached us to create single malt whisky cocktails, we knew it was going to be an exciting partnership. At Notpla we want to create original solutions for how to serve and consume drinks, and The Glenlivet is a brand that is looking to do just the same\u201d added Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Notpla, a sustainable packaging start-up which partnered with Glenlivet, along with the Tayer + Elementary brand.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe shot-of-the-future doesn\u2019t seem to be going over as well on Twitter, which has referred to the latest invention as something \u201cno one asked for,\u201d and, aptly, likened it to Tide Pods \u2014 but for whiskey, and not as colorful.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThough some on Twitter took time to share helpful tips of when the pods could be most useful.\n\nHowever, there will be no savoring this launch, as the pods will only be available in London during the city\u2019s cocktail week, Oct. 4 \u2013 13.", "description": "You know how the worst part of drinking is having to be responsible enough to hold a glass?
