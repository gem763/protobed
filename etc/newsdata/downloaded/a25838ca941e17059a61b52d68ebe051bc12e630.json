And at the center of it all is a grim Oscar the Grouch, played by Stranger Things\u2019 actor David Harbour.\n\nHarbour\u2019s gritty antihero garbage man is intended to be a parody of the new movie Joker, which stars Joaquin Phoenix as a failed comedian who eventually becomes Batman\u2019s arch-nemesis. The movie portrays the Joker as a lonely man, who lives with his mother and faces constant disappointment, violence and isolation \u2014 pushing him into a life of crime.\n\nSNL\u2018s Oscar the Grouch, also appears to be beaten down by life in the same way as Phoenix\u2019s Joker.\n\n\u201cIf everyone calls you trash, everyone treats like you like trash, why don\u2019t you just become trash?\u201d Harbour\u2019s Oscar says as he is shown descending into a trash can.\n\nThe rest of the Sesame Street cast are struggling, too. Cookie Monster is shown begging on the street with a sign that says \u201cNeed money for cookies,\u201d while Elmo is getting arrested, telling cops, \u201cElmo innocent, Elmo didn\u2019t sell no crack.\u201d\n\nWatch SNL\u2019s skit here:\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Stranger Things\u2019 actor David Harbour plays a grim Oscar the Grouch in a Saturday Night Live parody of Joker.", "authors": ["Sanya Mansoor"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/david-harbour.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C24px%2C1024px%2C536px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
