They came in on trucks and armoured cars, by bus and by ship.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A police officer detains an anti-government protester in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China September 22, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nThe state news agency Xinhua described the operation as a routine \u201crotation\u201d of the low-key force China has kept in Hong Kong since the city\u2019s handover from Britain in 1997. No mention was made of the anti-government protests that have been shaking the metropolis since June.\n\nIt was a plausible report: China has maintained a steady level of force in the territory for years, regularly swapping troops in and out. And days earlier, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters, embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had told local business people that China had \u201cabsolutely no plan\u201d to order the army to put down the demonstrations.\n\nA month on, Asian and Western envoys in Hong Kong say they are certain the late-August deployment was not a rotation at all, but a reinforcement. Seven envoys who spoke to Reuters said they didn\u2019t detect any significant number of existing forces in Hong Kong returning to the mainland in the days before or after the announcement.\n\nThree of the envoys said the contingent of Chinese military personnel in Hong Kong had more than doubled in size since the protests began. They estimated the number of military personnel is now between 10,000 and 12,000, up from 3,000 to 5,000 in the months before the reinforcement.\n\nAs a result, the envoys believe, China has now assembled its largest-ever active force of People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) troops and other anti-riot personnel and equipment in Hong Kong.\n\nSignificantly, five of the diplomats say, the build-up includes elements of the People\u2019s Armed Police (PAP), a mainland paramilitary anti-riot and internal security force under a separate command from the PLA. While Reuters was unable to determine the size of the PAP contingent, envoys say the bulk of the troops in Hong Kong are from the PLA.\n\nPAP forces would be likely to spearhead any crackdown if Beijing decides to intervene, according to foreign envoys and security analysts. These paramilitary troops are specially trained in non-lethal tactics and methods of riot suppression and crowd control.\n\nThe envoys declined to say how exactly they determined that the recent troop movement was a reinforcement or how they arrived at their troop estimates. Reuters reporters visited the areas surrounding multiple PLA bases in Hong Kong and observed significantly increased movements by troops and armoured vehicles at the facilities.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of National Defense, the State Council Information Office, and the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not respond to questions from Reuters. In early September, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said China would \u201cnot sit idly by\u201d if the situation in the city continued to deteriorate and posed a threat to \u201cthe country\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThe office of Carrie Lam and the PLA garrison in Hong Kong also did not respond to questions. A Hong Kong police spokesperson told Reuters the police force was \u201ccapable of maintaining law and order and determined to restore public safety in Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nREVAMPING THE PARAMILITARY\n\nThe PAP is a key element in Chinese leader Xi Jinping\u2019s drive to reinforce the ruling Communist Party\u2019s control over the nation of 1.4 billion people while building a potent military that can supplant the United States as Asia\u2019s dominant power. The PAP has up to one million troops, according to an April research paper from the U.S.\u2019s National Defense University - about half the size of China\u2019s standing military. The paramilitary\u2019s primary duty is to defend against potential enemies within - countering domestic upheaval and protecting top leaders. In recent years, it has contained unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet. Elements of this force are also trained for counter-terrorism, securing key infrastructure, disaster relief and international peacekeeping.\n\nAfter installing himself as commander-in-chief and reshaping the regular military, Xi turned attention to the PAP. His first move was to take personal control. In early 2018, the PAP was brought under direct command of the Central Military Commission, the top military decision-making body that Xi chairs. Previously, the PAP had come under the split command of the commission and the State Council, China\u2019s top government administrative body.\n\nThis put Xi at the apex of Beijing\u2019s military and paramilitary forces, further concentrating power in his hands. With the eruption of the protests in Hong Kong, however, Xi now faces the biggest popular challenge to his rule.\n\nNews of the reinforcements in Hong Kong comes as city officials are bracing for more demonstrations on Tuesday, Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Intense clashes between protesters and police rocked the city over the weekend ahead of the celebrations.\n\nIn her private remarks in August, city Chief Executive Lam played down the possibility that Beijing might deploy the PLA. Foreign envoys and security analysts said they too believe China\u2019s strong preference is not to use troops.\n\nStill, they said, the troop build-up shows Beijing wants to be ready to act if the Hong Kong government and its 30,000-strong police force lose control of the city. Lam herself expressed concern about the force\u2019s ability to keep control. On some days, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets. She said the police are \u201coutnumbered\u201d by the protesters, making enforcement \u201cextremely difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cApart from the 30,000 men and women in the force we have nothing,\u201d she told the gathering of business people. \u201cReally. We have nothing. I have nothing.\u201d\n\nUntil now, the PAP\u2019s presence in Hong Kong has been limited to a small advance detachment nestled discreetly within existing PLA facilities, according to one of the diplomats. The new deployment marks the first significant entry of the PAP into Hong Kong. It wasn\u2019t mentioned in official accounts of the rotation nor in the state-controlled press.\n\nThe combined deployment of the PLA and the PAP follows months of official statements denouncing the protests and dramatic signalling to Hong Kongers. This included news reports and footage showing anti-riot drills by both the PLA and the PAP, released by the military on social media. Last month, hundreds of PAP troops conducted extensive exercises in a football stadium in Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong. Troops in the area could also be deployed to Hong Kong if the crisis deepened, foreign diplomats said.\n\nENFORCING XI\u2019S \u2018RED LINE\u2019\n\nThe protests and street violence in Hong Kong erupted in early June, over a bill - since scrapped - that would have paved the way for people to be extradited to the mainland. The unrest came two years after Xi defined a \u201cred line\u201d for Hong Kong. He used the phrase in a 2017 speech in the city, warning that domestic threats to national sovereignty will not be tolerated.\n\nChinese security forces are better equipped to handle civil unrest than they were a generation ago. In 1989, it was the PLA that was sent in to smash student protests in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square. It used the tools of war - battle tanks, armoured vehicles and infantry.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the reinforcement includes equipment tailor-made for quelling urban violence with non-lethal force \u2013 including water cannon vehicles and trucks used to lay barbed-wire barricades. Additional transport helicopters have been moved into the city. Reuters reporters have seen these flying frequently around Hong Kong and its hinterlands, the New Territories, an observation confirmed by foreign envoys and security analysts monitoring developments here.\n\nOther trucks, bearing military number plates, have been seen pre-loaded with street fortifications, at times moving about the city. Reuters reporters have tracked increased activity at many of the PLA\u2019s 17 facilities across Hong Kong Island, its neighbouring city of Kowloon and the rural New Territories. Most of these facilities were inherited by the PLA under agreement with the departing British forces during the 1997 handover.\n\nFatigues and other laundry can be seen hanging from the balconies of buildings that had lain dormant for years. Army buses and jeeps are parked in once abandoned lots.\n\nSome foreign analysts say China\u2019s reinforced military presence was bigger than expected and appears to have been well-prepared. They say the size of the force means it is now far beyond the symbolic role traditionally played by the local garrison.\n\n\u201cThey do seem to have an active contingency plan to deal with something like a total breakdown in order by the Hong Kong police,\u201d said Alexander Neill, a Singapore-based security analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \u201cI would think it would take something like that or some other worst-case scenario for them to deploy. But they are clearly more ready than before, and are leaving nothing to chance.\u201d\n\nSo far, the expanded Chinese forces remain firmly within their barracks \u2013 a continuation of what has been an unobtrusive presence since the handover.\n\nIn 1997, trucks full of white-gloved PLA soldiers, some carrying flowers, rolled into Hong Kong within hours of Britain\u2019s handover of its colony to Chinese rule. The sight sparked anxiety among politicians, activists and the public that still lingers. Beyond the occasional so-called open day, when the public gets access to the PLA barracks, the troops rarely interact with ordinary Hong Kongers.\n\nUnlike forces on the mainland, soldiers within the Hong Kong garrison are not usually accompanied by their families. They are rarely allowed to socialise outside their bases; for news, they are given access to China\u2019s state media.\n\n\u201cThey live like monks,\u201d said one Hong Kong-based mainland security specialist familiar with local PLA forces. \u201cIt is a vastly different deployment to anything on the mainland \u2013 almost akin to something they might experience on peacekeeping duties in Africa.\u201d\n\nThe local Chinese security presence must be squared with handover guarantees that Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy would remain for at least 50 years - including broad freedoms and an independent judiciary, which don\u2019t exist in the rest of China.\n\nUnder the city\u2019s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, defence and foreign affairs are the sole responsibility of the Communist Party leadership in Beijing. The document states that the PLA garrison \u201cshall not interfere in local affairs,\u201d but Hong Kong can request the garrison\u2019s assistance to maintain public order. And garrison members must abide by local laws.\n\nChinese law, meanwhile, allows for the standing committee of China\u2019s parliament, the National People\u2019s Congress, to deploy the garrison if a state of war or emergency is declared for Hong Kong. The law cites \u201cturmoil\u201d that threatens national security and is \u201cbeyond the control of the (Hong Kong) government.\u201d\n\nONE PRESENCE, TWO FORCES\n\nThe PLA garrison is commanded by Major-General Chen Daoxiang, who is shadowed by a political commissar, Major-General Cai Yongzhong. But neither officer, nor territory leader Lam, would have the authority to deploy the security forces. Any military clampdown on China\u2019s freest and most international city would only be ordered by Xi\u2019s powerful Central Military Commission, say local officials and foreign diplomats.\n\nIn June, garrison commander Chen told a visiting Pentagon official that Chinese troops would not interfere in the city\u2019s affairs, according to people briefed on the discussion. U.S. officials at the time said they read the comment as an early signal that Beijing intended to keep them in their barracks.\n\nLess is known about the command structure of the PAP forces in Hong Kong. Few residents of the city are even aware of their presence within existing PLA facilities.\n\nFrom the early years of its revolutionary struggle against the Nationalists, the Chinese Communist Party fielded a range of paramilitary forces to guard the leadership and key headquarters. These forces assumed an internal security role after the Communists took power in 1949. The PAP was formed in 1982, as the paramount leader of the time, Deng Xiaoping, modernized and downsized the military after the Cultural Revolution. The PAP absorbed thousands of regular army troops.\n\nStill, the PAP was poorly trained and equipped, with a fragmented command, when the 1989 Tiananmen protests threatened the party\u2019s grip. China\u2019s leaders had to call on army units to crush the protests with tanks and machine guns. The scenes of bloodshed on the streets of the Chinese capital were a blow to the party\u2019s reputation. In the aftermath, the leadership reequipped and retrained the PAP in crowd-control operations.\n\nSecurity analysts say the PAP\u2019s budget has grown as the force has modernized, but figures are undisclosed. The government stopped revealing full domestic security spending numbers in 2014 - after the internal security budget had topped the fast-growing regular military budget for the previous three years.\n\nIn the restive region of Xinjiang, the PAP has been used heavily to counter what China describes as a terrorist threat from Uighurs, an ethnic Muslim minority. As many as a million Uighurs and Muslims from other ethnic groups have been incarcerated in prison camps, according to the United Nations. China counters that the facilities are vocational training centres to help stamp out religious extremism and teach new work skills.\n\n\u201cThe PAP can be seen as a blunt instrument with the key function of suppressing domestic unrest,\u201d said Trevor Hollingsbee, a retired British defence ministry intelligence analyst who served as a Hong Kong security official until 1997. \u201cTheir role has been streamlined and their command sharpened under Xi.\u201d\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S TOO RISKY\u2019\n\nThe PAP also has been active in southern China, close to Hong Kong. PAP riot police have been sent to quell factory strikes and other labour unrest in the Pearl River Delta, one of China\u2019s key manufacturing areas.\n\nIn 2011, before Xi came to power, PAP troops were deployed as part of the clampdown on Wukan. The southern coastal village drew international attention when residents threw up barricades against local authorities to protest land seizures. In a rare climbdown, the provincial government eventually dissolved the old village committee and allowed free elections. Many protest leaders were voted into office.\n\nWhen fresh protests broke out in 2016, over a failure to resolve the land issues and other grievances, the PAP and other security forces were sent in again. This time, the response was harsher.\n\nVideo footage of the clashes was shown by villagers to a Reuters reporter who reached the area soon after the protests erupted. It showed locals hurling bricks at ranks of shield-carrying riot police. The troops used tear gas, rubber bullets and batons. No deaths were reported. But a Reuters reporter on the scene observed several injured villagers, some with bloody head wounds.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Chinese military forces have been conducting anti-riot drills in their bases in recent weeks. Reuters reporters viewed one drill in late September from a public road near the PLA base in rural Tam Mei. They saw helmeted Chinese troops undergoing exercises, some armed with rifles, shields and batons. Inside the base were dozens of camouflaged armoured personnel carriers, command jeeps, large bulldozers and trucks.\n\nSlideshow (22 Images)\n\nReuters and foreign diplomats have also seen extra forces at the PLA headquarters in central Hong Kong, next to local government offices in the city\u2019s Admiralty district. Protests have broken out repeatedly just meters from the PLA compound. Amid attempts by police to secure the area, protesters have at times hurled petrol bombs near the headquarters\u2019 granite walls. Clouds of police tear gas have wafted into the compound.\n\nSo far, though, protesters haven\u2019t targeted PLA bases directly, even as they have vandalised the national flag and other symbols of Chinese sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t mess with the People\u2019s Liberation Army,\u201d said Leo Wong, a young protester, standing near the PLA headquarters during a late-September demonstration. \u201cIf we attacked the PLA, anything could happen. It\u2019s too risky.\u201d", "description": "Last month, Beijing moved thousands of troops across the border into this restive city.
