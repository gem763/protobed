The photos show the team posing in front of the complex\u2019s main Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nSome Twitter users were positive, and one even thanked the rugby team for their trip, but others were less positive. \u201cAre you aware of the Yasukuni shrine controversy?\u201d asked one. \u201cDid anyone inform you that Class A war criminals from WW2 have been enshrined there and it's now the symbol of far-right historical revisionists denying war crimes such as Nanjing Massacre?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you aware of the Yasukuni shrine controversy? Did anyone inform you that Class A war criminals from WW2 have been enshrined there and it's now the symbol of far-right historical revisionists denying war crimes such as Nanjing Massacre?\u201d\n\nThe current shrine was established towards the end of the 19th century to \u201ccommemorate and honor the achievements of those who dedicated their precious lives to their country,\u201d according to the shrine\u2019s website. The souls of 2,466,000 people are honored in the complex, where they are treated as \u201cdivinities.\u201d\n\nBut among these are 14 Japanese soldiers convicted of war crimes by the International Tribunal for the Far East following World War II. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe skipped a visit to the shrine this year on the anniversary of the Japanese surrender. Visits by previous prime ministers have provoked angry reactions from South Korea and China.\n\n\u201cWhat the museum can offer on a personal level is a fascinating journey from their military history to where they are now,\u201d Commander Shaw told the Times. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t realize the sensitivity [for] specific nations in particular. We know now.\u201d\n\nThe British team beat France on Sept. 19 to make it into the finals of the world cup. They will play the Republic of Fiji Military Forces Rugby Team on Monday, Sept. 23.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defence describes the competition between various countries\u2019 military teams as a way to \u201cfacilitate mutual understanding and exchange among armed forces.\u201d", "description": "A British military rugby team on tour in Japan has apologized for visiting a controversial military shrine honouring Japanese soldiers, among them war criminals.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/japanese-yasukuni-shrine-file-gty-jef-190919_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
