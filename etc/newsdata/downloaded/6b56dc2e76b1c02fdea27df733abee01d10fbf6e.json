Today's judgment is a victory of accountability against an individual who feels [he is] above the law.\"\n\nREAD MORE| SARS and the 'rogue' unit: the ultimate guide\n\nGordhan's attorney, Tebogo Malatji, confirmed to News24 the strike-out application had been dismissed, adding the court had not furnished reasons for the dismissal.\n\nHe said the strike-out application was made because the report was not relevant to the hate speech charges and it was not yet been established if the report was authentic and if it was, if it had been declassified.\n\nThe hate speech charges followed a scathing attack launched on Gordhan outside the venue, where he was testifying before the Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture in November 2018.\n\nAt the time, Malema called Gordhan \"corrupt\", \"a dog of white monopoly capital\" and claimed he hated black people, News24 previously reported.\n\nALSO READ| Gordhan vs Malema: Equality Court to hear of alleged scathing attacks\n\nMalatji added the lawful use of the report was still subject to another case involving Gordhan and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane.\n\nThis case relates to the review application of Mkhwebane's report into the SARS \"rogue unit\" in which she instructed President Cyril Ramaphosa to discipline Gordhan for his authorisation of the establishment of the unit while he was SARS commissioner.\n\nShe found the unit to have been illegal, it engaged in illegal activities, and Gordhan lied about a meeting with a member of the Gupta family.\n\nThe review application, which was instituted by Gordhan, has not yet been heard.\n\nMeanwhile, State Security Agency spokesperson Mava Scott said it would be going forward with its interlocutory application to have the IGI report struck from the EFF's court papers.\n\nThis after City Press reported on Sunday that State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo wanted to have the report removed from the EFF's court papers as it contained sensitive information.\n\n\"The report contains secret information exposing the identities of members and former intelligence members as well as methods of the agency, which is protected from publication by the law,\" Scott told the publication.", "description": "A classified report purporting to have found that the South African Revenue Services had a \"rogue unit\" has been leaked to the media by the EFF.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7079/462efac95b074c4eac1fc52fae230280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
