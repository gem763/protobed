If you're a Prime member, this is a great time to buy the Paperwhite, as Amazon has discounted the device by $45 for Prime customers.\n\nThe 32GB Paperwhite has a list price of $159.99, which has been reduced to $114.99. You can also currently get the 8GB Paperwhite for $89.99, which is $40 off its list price of $129.99.\n\nWe think either reader is an excellent purchase, especially for customers who don't want to spend $240 on the high-end Kindle Oasis. The Paperwhite is water-resistant, so you don't have to worry about taking it to the beach or pool, and has a crisp, clear screen resolution of 300 pixels per inch.\n\nIt also has a built-in backlight, so you can read in the dark with no problem. As a bonus, the battery lasts a whopping six weeks, so you'll rarely have to charge it \u2014 just like a regular book.\n\nWe highly recommend the Kindle Paperwhite, especially at such a low price.", "description": "Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite by $45 for Amazon Prime members.
