Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, accused Democrats of turning the committee into a \u201cgiant Instagram filter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference between formal impeachment proceedings and what we\u2019re doing today is a world apart, no matter what the chairman just said,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\n\n\u201cThe ambiguity \u2014 the confusion \u2014 is a product of my colleagues\u2019 own making because there is an easy way to know exactly whether this committee is in impeachment proceedings: it\u2019s called a vote \u2014 a vote of the full House of Representatives,\u201d he added.\n\nHe and his fellow Republicans argued that Democrats were using the vote to hide the fact that a vote to authorize an official impeachment investigation would fail on the House. They pointed out that a recent attempt to bring articles of impeachment up failed to get a majority of support from Democrats.\n\nThe new rules passed Thursday morning lay out four parameters for the investigation.\n\nIt allows Mr. Nadler to delegate some of the work to subcommittees, gives committee staff extra time to question witnesses, governs how information is kept private and allows for President Trump\u2019s legal team to review and respond.\n\nRepublicans pushed back hard against the new rules, particularly regarding committee staff questions and subcommittees. They argued members had the right to questions witnesses and if Democrats want to pursue impeachment, it needs to be carried out in the full committee.\n\nWith the new procedures in place, Mr. Nadler plans to hit the ground running with more hearings.\n\n\u201cWith these new procedures, we will begin next week an aggressive series of hearings investigating allegations of corruption, obstruction and abuse of power against the president,\u201d he said after the Judiciary meeting. \u201cThe investigation [will] go well beyond the four corners of the Mueller report.\u201d\n\nThe committee is also looking into potential issues corruption, launching probes into Vice President Pence\u2019s stay at a Trump-owned property in Ireland and the president\u2019s effort to host the G-7 summit at one of his Miami golf resorts.\n\nThe first hearing under the new rules will be on Sept. 17 featuring former Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
