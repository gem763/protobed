The investigation began about a year ago after news that the Trump-linked political-research firm Cambridge Analytica had improperly gained access to personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users and used the data for targeted political ads during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBad optics at a bad time for Facebook\n\nSome Facebook officials are worried that the emails could make for bad optics and further damage Facebook's bruised reputation if the emails were made public, The Journal reported.\n\nThe internal emails appear to show Zuckerberg discussing how to deal with certain issues affecting user privacy in light of the 2012 consent decree, the report said. It was not clear whether any of those discussions revealed practices that violated the agreement with the FTC, according to The Journal, which said it was briefed on the contents of some of the emails but had not itself reviewed them.\n\nOne email exchange that regulators are now looking at, according to The Journal, involves an April 2012 discussion between Zuckerberg and other Facebook insiders about a third-party app that appeared to sidestep Facebook users' privacy settings by collecting the personal information of tens of millions of Facebook users and making it viewable to others.\n\nZuckerberg inquired about the technical feasibility of such an app and appeared aware that it might violate the consent decree, which had been announced by then but had not yet formally taken effect, according to The Journal.\n\nFacebook ultimately suspended the app. But the sources told The Wall Street Journal that the emails do not paint a picture of Facebook proactively trying to determine if the app in question was part of a bigger privacy problem that needed to be addressed.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The internal emails appear to show that Zuckerberg knew some of its practices were questionable.
