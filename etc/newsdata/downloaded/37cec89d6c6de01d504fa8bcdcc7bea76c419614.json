Andy Biggs, the Arizona Republican who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\n\u201cChairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years,\u201d McCarthy said in a tweet. \u201cNow he is so desperate to damage the president that he literally made up a false version of a phone call. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nHOUSE COMMITTEES SUBPOENA POMPEO FOR UKRAINE DOCUMENTS AS PART OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nMcCarthy added: \u201cI have signed a resolution to censure Schiff in the House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who is leading one of the committees investigating Trump in the impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has been under fire from conservatives for the \u201cparody\u201d of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky that he read at the testimony last week of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nMaguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint detailing how Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate the Biden family.\n\nThe complaint contains allegations related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate alleged corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of those memorializing the call, shows Zelensky asking for more military aid before Trump asks him to pursue some kind of investigation into Biden and his son.\n\nOn the dais last week, Schiff gave his own exaggerated version of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\u201d\n\nSchiff later chalked up his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to parody.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times,\u2019 my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s explanation, however, did little to quell the outrage of his Republican colleagues who were already on the defensive following Pelosi\u2019s announcement last Tuesday of the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee read a statement that was blatantly false, had no corresponding evidence nor relationship to the actual transcript of President Trump\u2019s telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president,\u201d Biggs said in a video posted on Twitter. \u201cThat is inexcusable.\u201d\n\nTrump also weighed in on Schiff\u2019s \u201cparody\u201d reading \u2013 calling the California Democrat \u201cdesperate\u201d and accusing him of lying to Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.\u201d\n\nSchiff shot back at Trump on social media, accusing the president of trying to \u201cshakedown\u201d a world leader for election dirt and then trying to cover it up.\n\n\u201cYou engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd then you tried to cover it up.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Adam Shaw and Brian Flood contributed to this report.", "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added his name to a\u00a0resolution Wednesday that would censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff for reading a \"parody\" version of President Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing last week.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/25/694940094001_6089426092001_6089421483001-vs.jpg"}
