They are so dangerous.\n\n'You can't switch off, at all. So it's just working really hard and staying switched on mentally because they can make something out of nothing with some of the players they have.\n\n'I suppose there's an element of just being physical.\n\n'It's the same any rugby game you play but as a front five forward, it's all about being as physical as you can and hopefully coming out on top.'\n\nNew Zealand have been relentless in the Rugby World Cup so far and they topped Pool B\n\nNew Zealand have been typically relentless in the Rugby World Cup so far as victories over South Africa, Canada and Namibia saw them top Pool B before their final game with Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nIreland toppled the All Blacks for the first time in history in a stunning 40-29 win in Chicago in 2016.\n\nThen head coach Joe Schmidt's men saw off New Zealand for their maiden win in Dublin in November's fine 16-9 victory.\n\nIreland recorded their first victory over the All Blacks in Chicago in 2016, winning 40-29\n\nFurlong started last November's 16-9 victory over New Zealand, Irelan's first on home soil\n\nIRELAND VS NEW ZEALAND - LAST 3 MEETINGS November 5 2016: Ireland 40-29 New Zealand November 19 2016: Ireland 9-21 New Zealand November 17 2018: Ireland 16-9 New Zealand\n\nThat left Ireland team of the year, Schmidt coach of the year and Johnny Sexton player of the year in a clean sweep at World Rugby's 2018 awards.\n\nWhile 2019's third-place Six Nations finish and a record loss to England in August left Ireland frustrated ahead of jetting into Japan, Schmidt's men will now eye reaching the World Cup semi-finals for the first time.\n\nIreland are yet to hit top gear at the Rugby World Cup so far after a defeat to host nation Japan followed by a sluggish victory over Russia, but showed improvements in their final game, beating Samoa 45-7 with 14 men for most of the game.\n\nWhile Ireland will certainly be buoyed by those recent memories of beating New Zealand, British and Irish Lions prop Furlong warned his side not to enter the quarter-final with any preconceptions.\n\n'I suppose you can draw a bit of confidence from previous wins but rugby evolves and it evolves quickly,' said Furlong.\n\n'We haven't played them that recently now really, and the game moves on, things changes, systems change.\n\n'It gives us confidence that we have got results in the past but at the same time it doesn't guarantee you anything.\n\n'It doesn't mean they're going to rock up and play the same plan as before.'", "description": "Tadhg Furlong has warned that to switch off even for a second against New Zealand will cost Ireland the chance of a maiden World Cup semi-final.", "authors": ["Nick Purewal"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/16/19658594-0-image-a-67_1570982267210.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
