It's always on Fifa or Pro Evo but you never ever go as them. \"They'll be full of 70 rated players, I'll get pumped\" you say to your friend, before hitting the square button another time to get a better random choice of side. Then you end up with a Japanese team who are even worse but end up winning 1-0 against your pal's Real Madrid. Ahhhh university was good.\n\nAnyway, in real life Atalanta are very decent these days - rated a 79 overall on Fifa 20 no less. Man City are a far higher 86 for context, but that might help suss out what we should expect.\n\nDuvan Zapata, Josip Ilicic, and Alejandro Gomez are the stars of a team that always plays in a variation of 3-4-3 or 3-4-1-2 and Gian Piero Gasperini is the mastermind behind it all. Pep Guardiola will have warned his players not to be complacent after doing the same thing in his pre-match press conference but there's not much he can do once the game kicks off.\n\nStay with us for all the build up and action from the Etihad.", "description": "City are just passing the ball around the whole pitch.", "authors": ["Jj Bull", "Ipek Tugcu", "Jim White", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213814492-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU4HJ4AiiGZy0TyJNCL1chidMhI9SKIL0YB1nAMLBvEs.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
