I was absolutely speechless and thought how low can you get. The whole idea was to have a friend do the work because we wanted someone we could trust.'\n\n'The sofa is gone. There was no way we could let our kids sit on it again knowing what happened'\n\nThey apparently took to the family's corner sofa (pictured) to have sex - and the family have since given it away because they couldn't bear to have it in the house\n\nPolice in Cumbria are investigating the incident because Mr Wilson is accused of stealing the homeowner's beer on the night of passion.\n\nThe extraordinary affair emerged in a video published by The Sun today.\n\nIt shows the woman pulling up in her car where Mr Wilson was waiting inside.\n\nThe plumber (pictured) was heard exclaiming to his lover: 'They're watching us in Turkey while we're sat on his couch drinking beer'\n\nThey apparently took to the family's corner sofa to have sex - and the family have since given it away because they couldn't bear to have it in the house.\n\nAt one point during the night of passion Wilson appeared to notice the camera, which had a microphone.\n\nHe exclaims: 'I don't like the look of that f***ing Dalek thing that's on there.
