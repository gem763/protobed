He gave me some perspective.\n\n\u201cNow, I try to enjoy the tennis and I barely think of that fist-round loss two years later.\u201d\n\nGauff, meanwhile, confirmed she is \u201c100 percent\u201d ready to play at this week\u2019s Luxembourg WTA event where she will enjoy a career-high ranking inside the top 70.\n\nShe started the week in Linz at 110 in the world and was originally set for an early departure from Austria after losing in the qualifying rounds before grabbing a lifeline as a lucky loser.\n\n\u201cFor sure, I\u2019m 100 percent playing in Luxembourg,\u201d said Gauff whose rise has been meteoric \u2014 at the end of 2018, she was 686 in the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, it will be my last event for the year. I\u2019m playing doubles there also (with regular partner Caty McNally).\n\n\u201cThis is the opportunity to see how I perform at back-to-back tournaments.\u201d\n\nGauff\u2019s career timetable has suddenly shifted into overdrive, with her breakthrough WTA trophy coming much more quickly than might have been expected.\n\n\u201cMy goal was the top 100 and to get into the main draw of at least one Grand Slam,\u201d said the player, who has now earned a main draw spot for January\u2019s Australian Open.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve accomplished all of those goals this year, now I need to work on improving my game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through what was supposed to be my timeline for the next two years. It\u2019s been crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be on the Tour in general right now,\u201d the 2018 French Open junior champion said.\n\nGauff, coached by her father, said she expects to start gaining confidence as she gets more accustomed to the WTA circuit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m new to the Tour and I\u2019ve not faced a lot of the players. I\u2019m sure the more matches I play the more confident I\u2019ll get, along with the more experience I\u2019ll have.\u201d", "description": "Linz (Austria) (AFP) \u2013 Coco Gauff hailed Roger Federer for his words of wisdom as the 15-year-old US prodigy on Sunday became the youngest champion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/113990_coco-gauff-celebrates-victory-jelena-ostapenko-in-linz-final-gauff-salutes-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
