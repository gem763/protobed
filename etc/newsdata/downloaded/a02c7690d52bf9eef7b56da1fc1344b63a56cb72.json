Haskins, the 15th overall pick in last spring\u2019s draft, has not developed as quickly as some other rookie quarterbacks, though many observers feel that delay is due to the fact he started only 14 games at Ohio State and needs time to get acclimated to the professional game\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA big step, many have said, will be for him to take snaps with the first-team offense, something he has not been able to do much since Keenum and Colt McCoy have started all of the team\u2019s games this year and first-team repetitions in practice usually go to the starting quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s invaluable for a backup to take all the starting reps especially at the start of the week in terms of putting your plan together and laying it out there and making all the adjustments whether it\u2019s new communication, new formations, handling the motion game \u2014 the shift-motion game,\u201d Callahan said.\n\nThen he added this.\n\n\u201cI thought he did a really good job today.\u201d\n\nWhen Callahan took over for the fired Jay Gruden last Monday he emphasized something Gruden had been saying for some time: Haskins needed time to grow. He did not give a time for when the team would turn to Haskins but the fact he didn\u2019t do so seemed to suggest it might be a few weeks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter watching Haskins on Wednesday, Callahan sounded more optimistic.\n\n\u201cHis growth is starting to show in practice and also in his preparation,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cHe\u2019s in [the facility] earlier [in the morning], he\u2019s out later [in the day] so its all coming to fruition. It\u2019s going to take a little time but it was good to see him take a major step today in the practice.\u201d\n\nHaskins has only played once this season, replacing Keenum in the Sept. 29 loss at the New York Giants. He completed nine of 17 passes in that game for 107 yards but had three interceptions and looked as if the professional game was still too fast for him. McCoy started the next week\u2019s game before Callahan made Keenum the starter again, emphasizing after last Sunday\u2019s victory at Miami that he will continue starting Keenum.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s making the plays that can be made and controlling what he can control,\u201d wide receiver Terry McLaurin said of Haskins. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitor. Obviously, he wants to be out there but whether hes taking first-team reps or scout-team reps, he\u2019s treating it like a gamelike situation. I feel like that\u2019s only going to help his development.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLike Callahan, McLaurin \u2014 a teammate of Haskins\u2019s at Ohio State \u2014 said he has seen improvement in Haskins.\n\n\u201cI have all the confidence that Dwayne is going to be where he needs to be,\u201d McLaurin said.\n\nNotes: McLaurin seemed amused when told that Keenum has pushing to have people call McLaurin \u201cScary Terry,\u201d even suggesting that he, Keenum, had come up with the nickname.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou definitely got to keep the quarterback happy,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cSo if he wants to call me that, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what kind of nickname he\u2019d like to have, McLaurin paused for a moment and then said: \u201cTouchdown Terry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I need a nickname,\u201d he quickly added.\n\nGrowing up, he said friends and teammates have called him \u201cF-1\u201d an apparent reference to his speed and \u201cMcLorean\u201d as in the old sports car. \u2026\n\nCleveland Browns General Manager John Dorsey told Cleveland reporters on Wednesday that he had talked to the Redskins about trading for left tackle Trent Williams, who s holding out, but said that \u201cit takes two to tango.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWashington President Bruce Allen has refused to trade Williams, sticking to a plan to draw Williams back through a loss of salary and signing bonus money. The Redskins shot down rumors, earlier in the week, that a Williams trade to Cleveland was possible. The NFL trade deadline is Oct. 29. \u2026\n\nAD\n\nLike Keenum, running back Adrian Peterson missed Wednesday\u2019s practice to rest, though an injury report released later said he has a quadriceps injury. Fellow running back Chris Thompson is dealing with a turf toe injury and did not practice.\n\nOthers missing practice included safety Deshazor Everett (ankle), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring), guard Wes Martin (chest) and cornerback Josh Norman (thigh and hand). Tight end Vernon Davis remains in the concussion protocol but practiced on a limited basis Wednesday as did tackle Donald Penn who was not listed on the report.\n\nRead more Redskins coverage:\n\nAD", "description": "The rookie got an unexpected chance to practice with the first-team offense and later interim coach Bill Callahan said he is seeing growth in the player.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BmuTrVA0BSpRQ-rIDRiWl4-43e0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SWPEROHJBII6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
