This leaves too many youngsters making unsuitable career decisions, which have a potentially devastating impact on their future,\u201d he said.\n\nMany young people are likely to miss out on vital guidance that will undermine their ability to make the right choices between academic and vocational routes, the organisation says.\n\nThe LGA is calling on the government to hand over funding and control of employment and skills schemes to local areas so pupils can be matched with employment routes within local communities.\n\nThey say localised support would enable councils to develop an all-age careers service, which would help reduce the number of young people not in education, employment and training.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago the government\u2019s Careers Strategy pledged to provide an improved service that supports people of all ages. Instead, careers provision in England is becoming ever more fragmented and complex,\u201d Cllr Bentley said.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
