Americans officials have long wanted Hamadi extradited to the US to face trial for the TWA hijacking and the murder of the sailor.\n\nGreek officials have not commented and the suspect remains in jail.\n\nGreek officials did not return calls for comment on the discrepancy but one police official speaking on background to Insider said that biometric data led to the arrest. Hamadi was said to be in his late 30s in 2005, which would put him in the same age range as the detained suspect.\n\n396463 03: The Mukefaha, a Lebanese Army anti-terrorism special unit, train at the Beirut International Airport October 26, 2001 in Lebanon.

The hostage, a prominent German archaeologist, was released unharmed after Hamadi was paroled and deported to Lebanon, which has since refused to act on US demands for his extradition.\n\nThe suspect is currently being held in a prison on Syros, near Mykonos, and will be transferred to Athens this week to face extradition hearings on both German and American warrants. The US is expected to push hard for their warrant to take priority over Germany's in part because of concerns that he would be released again.\n\nIf the Greek police are correct and the suspect is confirmed to be Hamadi, it will reopen an unexpected chapter in the career of one of Hezbollah's highest-profile operatives.\n\nHamadi is accused of helping mastermind the 1985 hijacking with Imad Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah master terrorist who was accused of a slew of attacks and kidnappings against US, French, Israeli and other targets from 1981 to 2008, when he was killed in a joint Mossad-CIA operation in Damascus.\n\nHamadi was originally arrested in Germany, while carrying bomb-making components in 1987 and convicted of hijacking and murder before being held for 19 years prior to his 2005 release.\n\nThe hijacking of TWA Flight 847 stunned the US in 1985. Two armed men stormed the cockpit of the plane as it departed Athens for Rome before being scheduled to continue to San Diego. They diverted the plane to Beirut, where US Navy sailor Robert Dean Stetham was beaten, shot, and dumped on the tarmac as the plane was refueled, and more heavily armed hijackers, including Mughniyeh, joined the operation.\n\nA Shi'ite Muslim gunman talks to one of the hijackers of a TWA plane at Beirut airport in this file photo taken in June 1985.

He joins a slew of other Hezbollah operatives that Lebanon refuses to arrest, including two other hijackers from the 1985 operation; four men accused of plotting the 2005 car bomb murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri after being tried in absentia by a UN special tribunal; as well as two suspects in a 2012 suicide bombing against Israeli tourists at a Bulgarian Black Sea resort.\n\nLebanon has officially claimed that it lacks information on the suspect's locations, but privately officials concede that the Lebanese government lacks the ability to confront Hezbollah and arrest its members.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mitch Prothero"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d889ca72e22af0c62435424-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
