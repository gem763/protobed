These pain relief tricks from gynaes might help Nope, not wearing a bra today.\n\nGetting your period is already A Whole Thing. And having to deal with breast tenderness before your period is just the cherry on top of the PMS sundae. After all, it\u2019s zero fun to go about your day feeling like you\u2019ve been punched in the boobs or can\u2019t do jumping jacks without tripling up on sports bras.\n\nBut while having breast tenderness before your period can be rough, it\u2019s generally not something to worry about. \u201cA lot of women come in to the office with breast tenderness and are very worried about it, but it\u2019s very common,\u201d says Dr Taraneh Shirazian, an ob-gyn with NYU Langone Health.\n\nOf course, if you deal with period-related breast tenderness, you probably have some questions about what\u2019s going on here and why you, of all people, have to deal with it. Keep these answers \u2014 and treatment tips from experts! \u2014 to your burning boob pain questions in mind the next time yours start to feel sore.\n\nIs breast tenderness before my period normal? What causes it?\n\nFor the record, having breast tenderness before your period is normal, says Dr Mary Jane Minkin, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynaecology and reproductive sciences at Yale Medical School.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this might happen. One is that your hormones change after you ovulate (about two weeks before your period arrives), Dr Shirazian says. Levels of progesterone, a hormone that prepares your body for pregnancy, increase after this time and levels of estrogen, which helps regulate your cycle (among other things), are high. All of this hormonal activity contribute to the sensations of soreness and pain in your breasts.\n\nYou might also experience fibrocystic breast changes, meaning you develop fluid-filled sacs in your breasts before your period\u2014and those can also feel sore, Dr Minkin notes.\n\nREAD MORE: 12 Reasons Your Boobs and Nipples Are Itchy AF\n\nHow can I tell if breast tenderness is period-related or not? Can it be a sign of pregnancy too?\n\nYup, you\u2019re on the money: You can also get sore boobs when you\u2019re pregnant. \u201cFor many women, breast discomfort is one of the early notifications of a pregnancy,\u201d says Dr Minkin.\n\nThat makes the whole pre-period breast tenderness a little confusing, even for doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell the difference, to be honest,\u201d says Dr G. Thomas Ruiz, lead ob-gyn at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California.\n\nThat said, there are a few key differences to look out for. When breast tenderness is related to your period, it\u2019s cyclical, meaning it usually comes on during specific times within the month and then gets better after your period wraps up, Dr Ruiz explains. \u201cIf you\u2019re pregnant, it\u2019s not going to go away and it will get more progressive,\u201d he points out.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant and you\u2019re curious if this is a sign you might be, you\u2019ll still, unfortunately, have to wait for your period to arrive (or not to arrive) to have a better idea. \u201cIf the tenderness is unrelenting and you don\u2019t get your period, you could be pregnant,\u201d Dr Shirazian says.\n\nHow long will my breasts typically hurt before my period?\n\nEvery woman is different. You might start to experience it as early as two weeks before you get your period, around the time that you ovulate, Dr Shirazian says. For others, it can come on a week or so before your period arrives, Dr Ruiz says.\n\nREAD MORE: What Exactly Are \u2018Dense Breasts\u2019?\n\nOkay, tell me: How can I ease this pain?!\n\nYou don\u2019t have to lie in bed, groaning, with an ice pack strapped to your boobs (although that\u2019s definitely an option). Instead, there are a few easy things you can do to try to make yourself a little more comfortable until the discomfort subsides.\n\nPop a pain reliever . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are best for this, Dr Shirazian says.\n\n. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are best for this, Dr Shirazian says. Wear a comfy AF sports bra. Certain bras (like those with underwire) can dig into your boobs and make you feel even more uncomfortable.

Many women have breast changes that are sensitive to caffeine. \u201cCaffeine is [in general] a stimulator \u2014 it stimulates many different cells,\u201d Dr Ruiz says. \u201cIt can make breast tenderness worse in women who are sensitive to it.\u201d\n\nMany women have breast changes that are sensitive to caffeine. \u201cCaffeine is [in general] a stimulator \u2014 it stimulates many different cells,\u201d Dr Ruiz says. \u201cIt can make breast tenderness worse in women who are sensitive to it.\u201d Try a \u201ccocktail\u201d of vitamins. Dr Minkin specifically recommends that her patients take a combination of 100-200 milligrams of vitamin B6, 200 units of vitamin E, and two capsules of evening primrose oil. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t cure 100 percent of folks, but my success rate is about 70 percent,\u201d she says, adding that she has her patients take the combination until the pain has cleared up.\n\nDr Minkin specifically recommends that her patients take a combination of 100-200 milligrams of vitamin B6, 200 units of vitamin E, and two capsules of evening primrose oil. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t cure 100 percent of folks, but my success rate is about 70 percent,\u201d she says, adding that she has her patients take the combination until the pain has cleared up. Yup, ice your boobs. Seriously, it can help, Dr Shirazian says. If an ice pack is too much, putting a cool washcloth over your chest can also do the trick.\n\nIf my breast pain seems random, what are the other reasons that might be at play?\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with breast pain that doesn\u2019t seem to be cyclical and get better after your period, there could be a few potential causes:\n\nYou\u2019re having too much caffeine on the reg. Again, caffeine can stimulate your breast cells, and put you in pain. Try scaling back and little and seeing where that gets you.\n\nAgain, caffeine can stimulate your breast cells, and put you in pain. Try scaling back and little and seeing where that gets you. It\u2019s related to medication you\u2019re on. Certain medications can cause your boobs to be sore. \u201cOne of the most common is an asthma medication called aminophylline, which is a sister of caffeine,\u201d Dr Minkin says.\n\nCertain medications can cause your boobs to be sore. \u201cOne of the most common is an asthma medication called aminophylline, which is a sister of caffeine,\u201d Dr Minkin says. You have fibrocystic breasts. Fibrocystic breasts have tissue that feels lumpy or rope-like in texture. \u201cIt means your breasts are prone to cysts,\u201d Dr Shirazian says. And those cysts can be pretty uncomfortable at times.\n\nThe bottom line: If you\u2019re experiencing breast soreness and you\u2019re not sure why, don\u2019t hesitate to talk to your doctor about it. They can do an evaluation to determine whether it might be period-related or something else \u2014 and offer you tailored solutions.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Nope, not wearing a bra today.", "authors": ["Korin Miller"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5210/668d83b7762f4deb8032dab2373f80ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
