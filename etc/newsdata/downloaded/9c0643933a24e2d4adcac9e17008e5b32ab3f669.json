But this match was about something more. For the first time in 40 years, women were in attendance.\n\nYes over 3000 women came to the game and they were blowing horns and also wearing the team colours. Most of these women were probably not around the last time their gender was allowed to watch a game of football on home soil.\n\nAFP\n\nAfter the Islamic revolution in 1979, women were banned from watching games involving men barring a few exceptions. But under pressure from FIFA, the authorities buckled and allowed tickets to be sold to them.\n\nHowever the journey has not been easy. Even those present did not forget to pay tribute to Blue Girl. Who was she? The Iranian fan who immolated herself after facing jail time for trying to get into a match. She had dressed as a man and was sentenced to 6 months in prison.\n\nDon't Miss 170 SHARES 218 SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES 1.1 K SHARES\n\nAFP\n\nIt was an emotional moment for the women who were entering the stadium as they knew they were the first of their generation to make it through. Some people have criticised the presence of a women's only section as then they could not attend and sit with the male members in their family.\n\nAFP\n\nOf course what we cannot know is if such scenes will be regular. This may well have been an exception. FIFA of course has been clear, all women should be eligible to watch all football matches. Now whether or not the authorities in Iran relent is another matter entirely.\n\nAFP\n\nThey have already had to wait 40 years, one hopes it's not another 40 years until it happens again. Or else Blue Girl's sacrifice will have been for nothing, though it was a tragedy to begin with. It has been a long and hard journey for Iranian women and while the rules may change, the mindset will not change overnight so that is something the beautiful game has to combat. But this is a start nonetheless. The first step towards progress and every ocean begins with a small drop.\n\nWith Inputs From Reuters.", "description": "When Iran took on Cambodia at home the Asian powerhouse crushed them 14-0.
