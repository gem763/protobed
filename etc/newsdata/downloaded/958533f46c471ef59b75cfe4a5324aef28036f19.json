He criticized past administrations for tolerating unfair economic and trade practices and repressing Chinese citizens.\n\n\u201cThe political establishment was not only silent in the faces of China\u2019s economic aggression and human rights abuses, but enabled them,\u201d Pence said.\n\nTrump has done business in several countries with poor human rights records. He received as much as $1 million last year for soaring twin towers bearing his name in Turkey, where the president has imprisoned more than 150 journalists since a failed coup three years ago. And before he ended the venture three years ago, Trump earned millions for licensing his name for a building in Azerbaijan, whose government has imprisoned dozens of critics, journalists and activists, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nTrump has planted the seeds for possible future business in China, too. Since he took over as president, Trump and his daughter Ivanka have won dozens of trademarks from the Chinese government for exclusive use of various names for restaurants, bars, hotels, clothing and shoes, and other products and services in the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has also escalated pressure on Chinese trade, foreign and economic policies, including a tit-for-tat exchange of trade tariffs on billions of products.\n\nOn Oct. 11, the United States and China reached a tentative cease-fire in their trade dispute. The Trump administration agreed to suspend plans to raise tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports from 25% to 30% on Oct. 15, and China agreed to buy more U.S. farm products.\n\nNegotiators are still working out details of the modest \u201cphase one\u201d deal in time for Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to sign it at an Asia-Pacific summit next month in Santiago, Chile. But the big issues dividing the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2014 most involving China\u2019s aggressive push to challenge U.S. technological dominance \u2014 remain unresolved.\n\nPence said the FBI has 1,000 active investigations into intellectual property theft, the majority involving China. In March, Tesla sued a former engineer accused of stealing 300,000 files related to an autopilot system before bolting for a job at a Chinese self-driving car company, he said.\n\nLast December, the Justice Department announced it had broken up a hacking operation in which Chinese officials stole the names and data of 100,000 U.S. Navy personnel as well as ship maintenance information \u201cwith grave implications for our national security,\u201d Pence said.\n\nAt a separate cybersecurity event in Washington, the Justice Department\u2019s top national security official, John Demers, said any progress in trade talks would have no bearing on future prosecutions involving Chinese espionage or intellectual property theft. Only a change in behavior by the Chinese would affect those decisions, he said.\n\nThe Justice Department has focused attention on the problem, creating a \u201cChina initiative\u201d to devote resources to it. As part of that effort, the FBI has been reaching out to universities across the country to warn them that their research is vulnerable to being stolen by China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stop doing cases about Chinese intellectual property theft when the Chinese stop doing intellectual property theft,\u201d Demers said.\n\nPence also chided China for its repression of religious minorities and its aggressive territorial disputes with smaller neighbors. He said the U.S. stands with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nMany of the protesters fly American flags. Trump has said he would \u201clike to see a very humane solution\u201d to the demonstrations.\n\n\u201cI hope that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said Oct. 7 at the White House. \u201cAnd, you know, Hong Kong is very important as a world hub \u2014 not just for China, but for the world.\u201d\n\nTrump said he is hopeful that a deal can be worked out. \u201cI think President Xi has the ability to do it,\u201d he added.\n\nChina took control of Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 under an agreement in which Beijing promised to let the city maintain its own legal and financial system and preserve civil liberties unseen on the mainland. The protesters fear Beijing is reneging on those promises.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Eric Tucker and Paul Wiseman in Washington and Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "The Vice President singled out Nike for removing Houston Rockets merchandise from stores in China after Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db25eec200000a728506ba4.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
