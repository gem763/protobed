Democrats know they probably only get one shot at using impeachment to remove him from office.\n\nNever before have we had a president who might be in a position to be re-elected after impeachment. Andrew Johnson wasn\u2019t nominated for another term, Bill Clinton was already in his second term, and Richard Nixon resigned in his second term in the face of certain impeachment.\n\nCould the House just impeach him again if there's a second-term scandal? Technically, it can do whatever it wants, legal experts tell us. There\u2019s nothing stopping it from bringing up new articles of impeachment if there\u2019s another scandal \u2014 or even on the same issue all over again.\n\n\"The constitutional answer is that there's no prohibition against impeaching the president multiple times,\" said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and author of \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump.\"\n\n\u201cThere is almost certainly NOT a barrier to a second impeachment, even for the exact same conduct,\u201d much less \u201ca second impeachment for a different offense,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, a former senior counsel to Kenneth Starr in the Whitewater investigation of Clinton, wrote in an email.\n\nPolitically, though, no one believes House Democrats would want to go through it again.\n\nA second impeachment would risk \u201ca political blowback in the midterm elections if Democrats are seen as nothing but a political party that wants to railroad, witch hunt, whatever you want to call it, this president,\u201d said Jim Robenalt, an Ohio-based lawyer who created a continuing legal education program with former White House counsel John Dean about Watergate.\n\nRobenalt also said Trump's dealings with Ukraine are at the heart of the kind of behavior the nation's founders wanted to remedy when they created impeachment: \"It's as core as core gets in terms of impeachable conduct.\"\n\n\u201cThe cold, hard political reality is that it would be very hard for the House ever to try to take another bite at the apple,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nThere is one unlikely scenario that could change Democrats' calculations: If Trump won re-election but Republicans lost their majority in the Senate, making the threshold for conviction on impeachment theoretically easier.\n\nWhat they're saying: A House leadership aide said it's a \"ridiculous\" premise and no one is gaming out a second impeachment \u2014 or even a first, other than the inquiry stage they're now in.\n\nThe aide said Dems are focused on finding out what happened with Trump and Ukraine and there are no strategic discussions happening about articles of impeachment, much less gaming out what might happen down the road if the president were re-elected.\n\nThat would be like \"planning your wedding before you've found the guy,\" the aide said.\n\nWhite House officials declined to comment.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the re-election of an impeached president is the most likely outcome. No one knows for sure, and Trump\u2019s polling against the Democratic front-runners isn\u2019t exactly strong.\n\nBut it\u2019s not impossible if the impeachment fight energizes Trump voters \u2014 and if battleground state voters get turned off by the 2020 Democrats\u2019 left turn.\n\nAnd although Trump doesn\u2019t want impeachment to define his place in history, as Axios\u2019 Jonathan Swan and Alayna Treene have reported, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s worried about losing in 2020 because of it.\n\nThe bottom line: By using the ultimate congressional power against Trump now, Democrats could be out of options if they have to face Trump for another four years.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
