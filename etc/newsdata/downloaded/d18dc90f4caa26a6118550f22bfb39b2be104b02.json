It was a telling demonstration of how influence over the 8-year-old conflict in Syria has shifted from the United States to Russia. But in this case, there appeared to be little balance left in the Americans\u2019 favor.\n\n\u201cLook at how they were preparing the base,\u201d a Russian-speaking reporter said in a video shot inside an abandoned American outpost in northeastern Syria, its water tanks, communication towers, tents and fridges full of soda all left behind. \u201cThey thought they were going to be here for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe abrupt order by Trump to remove U.S. military personnel from the area set off days of violence that sent more than 150,000 civilians fleeing, shattered the American partnership with Syria\u2019s Kurds, raised fears about an Islamic State revival and allowed Assad\u2019s troops, backed by their Russian allies, to sweep up new territory without a fight.\n\nPentagon concern about the safety of the departing U.S. forces amid the chaos in northern Syria intensified, as seen in a low-flying buzz of a Turkish-backed militia on Tuesday by American Apache helicopter gunships. The militia was about 4 miles from the Americans at the time of the incident, which was first reported by Fox News and confirmed by a U.S. military official.\n\nIt remained unclear on Tuesday whether President Vladimir Putin of Russia intended to keep his forces in the area indefinitely. But for Russia, the reshuffling of northeastern Syria, which had in recent years been a virtual American protectorate, yielded two main benefits. It empowered Assad, a longtime Russian patron, to accelerate his quest to regain control of all of Syria\u2019s territory, and gave Putin another place to advertise Russia as a good friend to have in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is a very complicated knot being untied,\u201d said Alexander Shumilin, a Middle East specialist at the Institute of Europe of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. \u201cThis is an unexpected gift for Putin.\u201d\n\nAs the United States has sought to reduce its commitments across the region, Putin has increasingly cast Russia as a worthy alternative. On Tuesday, as U.S. troops were leaving their bases near the Syrian town of Manbij, Putin was on a state visit to the United Arab Emirates after a trip to Saudi Arabia the day before.\n\nBoth are longtime American allies that have begun questioning the United States\u2019 commitment to their security and looking to diversify their international partnerships.\n\n\u201cI think of Russia as my second home,\u201d Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of Abu Dhabi, the de facto ruler of the Emirates, told Putin. \u201cWe are connected by a deep strategic relationship.\u201d\n\nThroughout the war in Syria, Russia has been Assad\u2019s most loyal foreign backer, protecting him from sanctions by the United Nations and sending Russian troops to support his forces and jets to bomb his enemies.\n\nAs of last month, Russia\u2019s assistance had helped restore Assad\u2019s control over most of Syria, the largest exception being the northeast, where the United States had partnered with a Kurdish-led militia to fight the Islamic State and had maintained a contingent of about 1,000 troops, in part to keep Assad away.\n\nBut that changed last Wednesday when Turkey launched its military incursion, setting off new violence that sent U.S. troops scrambling to get out of the way. Feeling betrayed by the Americans, the Kurds made a deal with Assad that would put his army along the Turkish border.\n\nThe United States has begun moving its troops onto bases elsewhere in Syria as the first stage in a near total withdrawal from the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, the United States and its international allies used a single tweet to announce their departure from Manbij, a contested area where they had sought to prevent fighting between their Kurdish-led militia allies and Syrian fighters backed by Turkey.", "description": "DOHUK, Iraq -- Russia asserted itself in a long-contested part of Syria on Tuesday after the United States pulled out, giving Moscow a new opportunity to press for Syrian army gains and project itself as a rising power broker in the Middle East.Russian and Syrian troops drove through a key town where", "authors": ["Ben Hubbard", "Anton Troianovski", "Carlotta Gall", "Patrick Kingsley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
