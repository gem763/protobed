But because the latest privacy issues took place in the United States, and not Europe, regulators in each EU country are permitted to start their own probes because the activity falls outside the remit of Ireland's Data Protection Commission.\n\n\"All EU supervisory authorities in whose jurisdiction data protection violations against persons who have used Facebook Messenger have occurred are responsible for investigating the respective violations,\u201d Johannes Caspar, the Hamburg commissioner for data protection, told POLITICO in an email. His agency has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s collection of people\u2019s data linked to the audio clips.\n\n\"An agreement has also been reached between the HmbBfDI and the IDPC in Ireland that the case must be taken over by the respective national data protection authorities,\" he added, in reference to the Hamburg and Irish privacy regulators.\n\nFacebook said its transcription trial was not available in Europe, but confirmed that 48 of its EU users had snippets of their audio chats transcribed and reviewed by a third-party company.\n\nUnder Europe's new privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, the company could face fines of up to 4 percent of its annual revenue if it is found to have broken the region's privacy rules.\n\nHamburg's privacy regulator has started an investigation and is working to clarify Facebook's activities in relation to collecting and transcribing EU citizens' audio chats without its consent.\n\nThe latest privacy issues facing the company comes after it was fined $5 billion by U.S. authorities over separate data protection issues. It also faces at least 10 ongoing privacy probes by Irish authorities in relation to how it complies with Europe's existing data protection standards.\n\nThis article has been updated with comment from Facebook.", "description": "The social networking giant initially said no local users were affected, but 48 EU citizens had their information collected without their knowledge.", "authors": ["Laura Kayali", "Mark Scott"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1153735276-1-1200x628.jpg"}
