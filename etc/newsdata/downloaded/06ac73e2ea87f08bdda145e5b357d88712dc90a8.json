Even counting streaming activity, adjusted to make it comparable to album sales, \u201cLover\u201d generated less consumption than Ms. Swift\u2019s earlier albums in their first week after release.\n\nEven so, the album landed the biggest sales week of the year and sold more copies than any album since the pop star\u2019s previous release, 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d But at about 679,000 copies sold in the U.S., according to Nielsen, \u201cLover\u201d missed the one-million mark each of her previous four albums surpassed, demonstrating anew how streaming has upended the record business.\n\nUnlike \u201cLover,\u201d Ms. Swift\u2019s previous albums were available for streaming only several weeks after being released. Her embrace this time of Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Pandora helped Ms. Swift rake in millions of listens during the album\u2019s first week. But more of her fans chose only to stream her music rather than purchase physical or digital copies. Overall consumption, including sales and streams, totaled about 867,000 units, earning the pop star her sixth No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nNielsen counts 1,250 subscription streams and 3,750 ad-supported streams as the equivalent of one album sale.\n\nThe decision to release \u201cLover\u201d directly to streaming platforms wasn\u2019t in vain: With 226 million on-demand audio streams, the record earned the second-biggest streaming week ever for a pop album, according to Billboard, behind Ariana Grande \u2019s \u201cThank U, Next.\u201d\n\nThe immediate release to streaming likely meant some fans who might otherwise have bought the album chose to stream it instead, said Nielsen Music analyst David Bakula. He added that many more people listened to the album than probably would have had it been available only for sale.\n\nEach of the major streaming services promoted Ms. Swift\u2019s new album heavily. Spotify Technology SA, the biggest, put her song lyrics on its billboards in cities across the world, and is carrying an enhanced version of \u201cLover\u201d featuring a video message and handwritten notes from the pop star.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should artists value streams over record sales if it brings them more listeners overall? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nStreaming services, which let users listen to an unlimited amount of music in exchange either for a monthly fee or for listening to ads, have changed how music is consumed. The format makes up 80% of total music consumption in the U.S., according to Nielsen. In 2017, when Ms. Swift released \u201cReputation,\u201d that share was about 60%. Industrywide album sales year-to-date have fallen 35% since then.\n\nRepresentatives for Ms. Swift and her label, Vivendi SA \u2019s Republic Records, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe shift from sales to streaming reduces the importance of first-week sales and in favor of long-term listening. Most fans who buy an album do so once within the first week; those who stream are likely to do so repeatedly over the next several weeks, months and years, generating revenue all the while. Over time, streaming becomes a larger piece of total consumption.\n\n\u201cThe first week is going to be the heaviest sales week, and for those people that bought the album, we\u2019ve counted them. As you go forward, those streamers are going to come back and listen again and again and again,\u201d said Mr. Bakula.\n\nFrom the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to the boom in streaming services today, the music industry has had to constantly adapt to emerging technology.

Streams, meanwhile, typically fall less than 50% and then tend to hold steady.\n\n\u201cThe streaming piece becomes even more important as we go through time,\u201d Mr. Bakula said. \u201cIt lengthens the monetization window for an artist.\u201d\n\nWith digital sales, a fan pays to download a permanent copy of a piece of music\u2014usually 99 cents to $1.29 for a song and $10 to $15 for an album. A superstar like Ms. Swift would typically be entitled to a royalty of around 20% of the sale price. Users of streaming services pay around $10 a month to rent access to an unlimited catalog of music, with artists paid a fraction of a penny each time someone listens to one of their songs.\n\nHelping bolster \u201cLover\u201d\u2019s sales tally\u2014abnormally high by industry standards despite being lower than Ms. Swift\u2019s prior albums\u2014 Target Corp. sold four deluxe album sets with a CD, lyric book and audio memos from songwriting sessions, each offering a different selection of pages from her journals, handwritten lyrics and photos. Ms. Swift also sold themed merchandise ranging from clothing, jewelry and fanny packs to key chains, mugs and phone cases that all came bundled with a digital album.\n\nWrite to Anne Steele at Anne.Steele@wsj.com", "description": "Sales of Taylor Swift\u2019s first album to hit streaming services and retail outlets simultaneously fell short of the pop singer\u2019s last four albums, according to Nielsen Music.", "authors": ["Anne Steele", "Anne.Steele Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102084/social"}
