Here we take a look at how the Brexit chaos played out on the front pages.\n\nMonday: 'Ready, steady, Chaos!'\n\nOn Sunday rebels from Johnson's Conservative party were told that if they voted in favor of the emergency no-deal legislation on Tuesday they would be thrown out of the parliamentary party and barred from standing as a Conservative at any future election.\n\nIn anticipation of the week ahead, London's Metro splashed \"Ready, steady, chaos!\" while Johnson's threat made it onto the Daily Mail: \"Back me or I'll sack you.\"\n\nTuesday: 'Back me or face a snap Brexit election'\n\nJohnson's threats continued into Tuesday's newspapers, after he indicated in a statement on Monday night outside Downing Street that he would seek an early election in an effort to thwart rebels within his own party.\n\nThe Prime Minister urged lawmakers to reject a proposal to take no deal off the table, making it clear he would prefer an election over another \"pointless\" Brexit delay. \"I don't want an election, you don't want an election,\" Johnson said -- with the unsaid implication that a new vote would be the only alternative.\n\nThe threats made it on to most UK papers, with the Guardian splashing: \"Back me or face a snap Brexit election,\" and the Daily Telegraph writing: \"I don't want an election, you don't want an election... but it's planned for October 14.\"\n\nWednesday: 'Parliament surrenders to the EU'\n\nDespite his threats, Johnson ultimately failed, after a rebel alliance of British lawmakers voted to seize control of the parliamentary agenda\n\nThe humiliating defeat led to an extraordinary purge, in which 21 Conservative lawmakers who voted in favor of the measure were booted out of the parliamentary party. Those sacked included Kenneth Clarke -- who had been a Tory MP for 49 years, former finance minister Philip Hammond and the grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames.\n\nThe Guardian called the rebel alliance a \"humiliation\" for Johnson and the Daily Mirror splashed that Johnson \"loses control.\"\n\nGuardian front page, Wednesday 4 September 2019: Humiliation for Johnson as Tory rebels turn against him pic.twitter.com/a2jbZygSSr \u2014 The Guardian (@guardian) September 3, 2019\n\nThe Daily Express led with a pro-Tory front page, writing: \"Parliament surrenders to the EU.\"\n\nThursday: 'Britain's worst PM' and 'Corbyn chickens out of an election'\n\nIn a series of setbacks for the Prime Minister on Wednesday, British lawmakers eventually passed a bill aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit and Johnson's proposal to hold a snap election on October 15 was denied.\n\nThe reaction by UK papers on Thursday was mixed, with the left-wing newspaper Daily Mirror calling Johnson \"Britain's worst PM (since the last one)\" and the Guardian reporting the Prime Minister had been \"cornered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Daily Telegraph splashed that opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn was a \"hypocrite\" for rejecting an election to break the \"deadlock,\" while The Sun photoshopped the Labour leader's face onto a chicken and asked, \"Is THIS the most dangerous chicken in Britain?\"\n\nTomorrow's front page: Seething Boris Johnson branded Jeremy Corbyn a \"chicken\" after the Labour leader blocked a snap General Election https://t.co/LtUUcvuyTm pic.twitter.com/EA4XnjhAPu \u2014 The Sun (@TheSun) September 4, 2019\n\nThe Scottish edition of The Sun took a different stance, however, splashing with the cheeky: \"Floppy Johnson can't get an election.\"\n\nToday's front page:\n\n\n\nBoris Johnson denied snap General Election until 'no deal' Brexit blocked pic.twitter.com/7GT0p502sL \u2014 The Scottish Sun (@ScottishSun) September 5, 2019\n\nFriday: 'Even Boris' own family don't trust him'\n\nOn Thursday the Conservatives continued to tear itself apart when Johnson's brother announced his resignation as government minister and MP.\n\n\"In recent weeks I've been torn between family loyalty and the national interest,\" Jo Johnson wrote on Twitter in a move that signaled that he had chosen the latter.\n\n\"Disaster for Boris as Brother quits,\" London's Evening Standard wrote, while the Daily Mirror splashed: \"Even Boris' own family don't trust him.\"\n\nJohnson also delivered a speech in front of a group of police recruits to highlight his government's promise to invest more money in policing, but the address quickly turned into an awkward and disjointed riff on Brexit and the prospects of a general election.\n\nThe Daily Express tabloid splashed with a quote from Johnson, writing: \"I'd rather be dead in a ditch than delay Brexit,\" while online newspaper, the Independent, led with: \"don't drag police into politics, Johnson warned.\"", "description": "Boris Johnson hasn't had the greatest start to his premiership as lawmakers returned to Parliament this week.", "authors": ["Bianca Britton"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190906124418-uk-newspapers-split-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
