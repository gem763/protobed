Photo: Franziska Krug/Getty Images\n\nTina Turner, a.k.a. Anna Mae Bullock, diva extraordinaire, chateau princess, has perfected the often tired and embarrassing rituals of romance, per a new New York Times profile. She of the iconic voice and legs set eyes on her current husband, Erwin Bach, liked how he looked, then promptly researched his full birth chart before demanding he have sex with her. Thirty years later, he drives her around in an SUV and stops speaking when she gestures for silence.\n\nTurner told the Times she first saw Bach at a record label party in 1985, after he \u201cemerged from behind a column in a jaunty windbreaker.\u201d She liked his nose and jaw but not his hairstyle, which seems to have prompted her to do more research into a potential coupling. Later that night, \u201cat a business dinner where she had made sure to look extra fine,\u201d according to writer Amanda Hess, \u201cshe mischievously requested every last record company executive\u2019s date of birth and then researched Bach\u2019s full astrological profile. (He\u2019s an Aquarius, thank God. Ike, obviously, was a Scorpio). Then, when the Cristal was flowing, she turned to him and said, \u2018I want you to make love to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile it is of course every woman\u2019s prerogative to forthrightly request a potential romantic partner\u2019s full birth chart immediately (this is international law), Turner\u2019s move is a smart way to gather data without interrupting a dinner. And her relationship proves that the perfect marriage is possible, if you use the moon and stars to find a mate who will heed your every beck and call. \u201cWhenever he talks too much,\u201d Hess reports, \u201cTurner raises a hand in the air and cinches her fingers together in the style of Dr. Evil, and he quiets.\u201d I love love.", "description": "Tina Turner describes researching her husband\u2019s full birth chart before demanding he make love to her in a new profile, which is the most perfect first date move in recorded history.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/09/09-tina-turner.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
