Daniels will miss the rest of the season after tearing a ligament and the meniscus in his right knee during the Trojans\u2019 opener.\n\nCoach Clay Helton confirmed the severity of his sophomore starter\u2019s injury Sunday night. USC (1-0) plans to start freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis against Stanford (1-0) at the Coliseum on Saturday.\n\nDaniels will redshirt this season, Helton said. With an estimated nine to 12 months of recovery from surgery, Daniels could be ready for camp next year.\n\n\u201cHe will be missed, but we will have to move forward, and we wish him nothing but the best,\u201d Helton said. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to be back.\u201d\n\nDaniels was hurt when his leg twisted while he was being tackled on a blitz with 27 seconds left in the first half of USC\u2019s 31-23 victory over Fresno State. Daniels started 11 games last season for USC\u2019s first losing team since 2000, and he won a four-way competition for the starting job last month in camp.\n\nDaniels had an inconsistent freshman year after arriving at USC as the nation\u2019s top quarterback recruit, but Helton and new offensive coordinator Graham Harrell believed Daniels would thrive in Harrell\u2019s version of the Air Raid offense. Daniels looked mostly sharp before his injury against the Bulldogs, going 25 of 34 for 215 yards and a touchdown, but also throwing a goal-line interception.\n\n\u201cThere were really some glimpses of what this offense can be, and it really excited me and our staff,\u201d Helton said.\n\nHelton is under pressure to produce an impressive bounce-back season for the Trojans, but that goal has a major new complication with Daniels\u2018 injury. Helton and Harrell face plenty of work to prepare Slovis in the next few days ahead of USC\u2019s annual early-season Pac-12 opener against the Cardinal.\n\nSlovis unexpectedly won the backup job in camp over Matt Fink and Jack Sears, who entered the transfer portal last week. Both Helton and Harrell have been effusive in their praise of Slovis, an unheralded 18-year-old recruit from Scottsdale, Arizona, who was coached by Pro Football Hall of Famer Kurt Warner in high school.\n\nBut Slovis has exactly one half of college football experience, and the Trojans largely ran the ball while he was behind center. That\u2019s not the ideal situation for a quarterback facing Stanford\u2019s traditionally tough defense, followed by the rest of USC\u2019s brutal slate of early-season opponents: BYU, Utah, Washington and Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cWe thought he made good decisions,\u201d Helton said. \u201cThere was just no fear. The moment has never been too big for the kid, and I didn\u2019t think it was too big for him last night. He walked out there bright-eyed and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go, Coach.\u2019\u201d\n\nSlovis completed one well-thrown 41-yard pass in the second half against Fresno State, but he also miscommunicated with a receiver and threw a bad interception on another play. He finished 6 of 8 for 57 yards.\n\n\u201cI was just doing what I normally do,\u201d Slovis said afterward. \u201cIt\u2019s the same as practice every day. It\u2019s just a live environment, and everyone else is watching this time. I don\u2019t think that much changed.\u201d\n\nSlovis won the backup job by outplaying Fink and Sears, who started one game last season when Daniels was injured. Sears elected to explore his options away from USC after losing the starting competition, but he has the most experience and possibly the highest upside of the remaining quarterbacks connected to USC.\n\nWhile Helton didn\u2019t mention Sears in his comments to the media Sunday night, neither Sears nor Helton closed the door last week on possibly getting Sears back on the team.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Jack and I always talked about, and I said (was), \u2018Hey, there is always an open door here,\u2019\u201d Helton said Saturday night. \u201cAnd he told me, he said, \u2018Coach, if you ever need me, I\u2019m there for you.\u2019\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Southern California quarterback J.T.
