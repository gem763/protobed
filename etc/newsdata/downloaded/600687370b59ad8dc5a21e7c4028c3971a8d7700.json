The Liberal Party won its mandate in 2015 parliamentary elections with 40% of votes cast. At this juncture, neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives appear to have the support required to win a majority of the seats in Canada\u2019s Parliament.\n\nCanada has a fixed-election date system, and Mr. Trudeau was required by law to trigger the start of the election campaign no later than Sept. 15 to allow for a minimum number of campaigning days by political leaders.\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s popularity has declined markedly this year under the weight of allegations that he and his senior aides tried to interfere in the criminal prosecution of a Montreal engineering company. A probe by Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog ruled last month Mr. Trudeau broke rules in trying to steer his then-attorney general away from proceeding with a trial against SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday in Ottawa, Mr. Trudeau, 47 years old, said the election would be a choice between inclusive politics and economic progress under the Liberals and austerity measures under a Conservative government.\n\n\u201cWe spent the last four years making things better, and we have the record to prove it,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.\n\nConservative Party leader Andrew Scheer said Wednesday the SNC-Lavalin scandal shows Mr. Trudeau has lost the moral authority to govern. The Conservatives want to make cost-of-living issues the centerpiece of the campaign and portray the Liberals as spendthrifts who are out of touch with Canadian households.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be outlining our vision for the country to put more money back in the pockets of Canadians and let them get ahead,\u201d the 40-year-old Mr. Scheer said.\n\nDespite Mr. Trudeau\u2019s lackluster showing in the polls and his high disapproval rating\u2014over 60%\u2014public support has yet to galvanize behind either Mr. Scheer or New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, whose social-democratic party stands in third place in the polls.\n\n\u201cI have not seen such a confused mess ahead of an election in a long time,\u201d said Darrell Bricker, chief executive of polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs. \u201cAs long as the current mood persists to election day, what the structure of the next government looks like is anyone\u2019s guess.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals have tried in recent weeks to portray Mr. Scheer as a social conservative who could pose a threat to the environment, citing his Conservative Party\u2019s pledge to roll back Liberal measures to fight climate change.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals are trying to plant the seed that Mr. Scheer is not the progressive prime minister Canada wants,\u201d said Lori Turnbull, a politics professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. According to Ms. Turnbull and other political watchers, that portrayal of Mr. Scheer is partly responsible for a Liberal recovery in the polls since the SNC-Lavalin scandal emerged in February.\n\nStill, the SNC-Lavalin affair threatens to continue haunting Mr. Trudeau as the formal campaign gets under way. A report Wednesday in Toronto\u2019s Globe and Mail newspaper said Canada\u2019s national police force has been looking into possible obstruction of justice allegations. The report said senior government officials weren\u2019t fully cooperating, citing rules requiring cabinet discussions to be kept secret.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police declined to comment on the matter Wednesday. A spokesman for Canada\u2019s justice department said the head of the public service decided to provide the same, partial waiver of cabinet confidence to police as was provided earlier this year to lawmakers who examined the SNC-Lavalin affair in committee. Mr. Trudeau said Wednesday he respected that decision.\n\nSeveral polls indicate the top issues among voters heading into the election include a deteriorating standard of living, health care, climate change, and taxes. Ethics and the SNC-Lavalin affair don\u2019t figure prominently, according to polls.\n\nWith the election call, certain election-financing rules kick in that limit the amount political parties and candidates can spend during the campaign. Canada\u2019s parliament is suspended until a new government is sworn in.\n\nWrite to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau triggered the formal kickoff of an election campaign toward an Oct. 21 vote, in which he will try to persuade voters to give the Liberal government another term.", "authors": ["Paul Vieira", "Kim Mackrael", "Paul.Vieira Wsj.Com", "Kim.Mackrael Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106144/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
