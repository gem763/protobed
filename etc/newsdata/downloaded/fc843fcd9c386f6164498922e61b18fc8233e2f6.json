And throughout the investigation into Russian interference in that election, the president sought to disparage U.S. intelligence agencies as a part of a politically motivated campaign to sabotage his presidency and sought to target some who spoke against him as partisan foils.\n\nThose who have come forward since the Ukraine impeachment inquiry was announced said they are determined to make clear that Trump\u2019s conduct falls well outside the institutional boundaries of the presidency.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat is happening currently is not normal,\u201d said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, who served as a U.S. intelligence officer on Russia and Eurasia before stepping down in 2018. \u201cThis represents a deviation from the way that these institutions regularly function. And when the institutions don\u2019t work, that is a national security threat.\u201d\n\nShe was among 90 national security veterans who signed an open letter published Sunday in support of the anonymous whistleblower who filed a complaint that Trump had acted improperly in asking the Ukranian president to investigate Biden in a July phone call.\n\nTrump has attempted to intimidate other government officials into not cooperating by casting those who offered information to the whistleblower as \u201cclose to spies.\u201d The open letter emphasized that the whistleblower \u201cis protected from certain egregious forms of retaliation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s critics have seized on criticism from ex-officials as evidence that Democrats have more than enough material to justify the impeachment proceedings against him and to try to remove him from office.\n\nMcGurk, the former special envoy charged with coordinating the global campaign against the Islamic State, issued a scathing series of tweets Monday calling Trump \u201cnot a Commander-in-Chief\u201d for his abrupt decision to order U.S. troops out of northern Syria. The move could put Kurdish forces, longtime partners in the fight against ISIS, in jeopardy.\n\nTrump makes \u201cimpulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation,\u201d said McGurk, who registered similar concerns in December when he resigned in protest.\n\nAD\n\nHis critique was met with widespread approval on social media, garnering nearly 50,000 likes, as prominent anti-Trump voices called on other former administration officials \u2014 most prominently former defense secretary Jim Mattis \u2014 to speak out in a similar vein.\n\nAD\n\nMattis also resigned in December in protest of Trump\u2019s policy on Afghanistan and Syria, but he has refrained from presenting an unvarnished public critique despite publishing a book in August on his Pentagon service.\n\n\u201cWhere is General Mattis?\u201d Joe Lockhart, who served as White House press secretary during President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings , wrote on Twitter. Nicolle Wallace, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, wrote that consensus among GOP national security experts and elected officials is that the country would be severely damaged by a second Trump term.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis would be the moment to say that out loud,\u201d she urged.\n\nSome former officials have been reluctant to weigh in part over fears it could muddy public perception of the national security institutions.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn some ways, doing that reinforces the narrative of some hostile deep state and people just point to that by saying, \u2018You see? We told you. They were there all along,\u2019 \u201d said a former high-ranking State Department official who left the agency last year. This person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly, felt conflicted about speaking out broadly against Trump after having served inside the administration.\n\nBut the former official acknowledged that Trump\u2019s attacks on government agencies are unprecedented and expressed dismay over remarks last weekend from Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), a prominent Trump ally, that he does not trust the FBI or CIA.\n\nAD\n\nRoberta Jacobsen, who stepped down as U.S. ambassador to Mexico in 2018, conceded that ex-career officials publicly opposing Trump could contribute to a broader perception of partisanship. But she signed onto the open letter because Trump\u2019s conduct \u201cso violates the rules that you were brought up on and because you think it\u2019s just dangerous for the United States.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts to impugn the whistleblower are part of his long-standing playbook to degrade the credibility of those who criticize him. He ripped Mattis \u2014 asking \u201cwhat has he done for me?\u201d \u2014 and said he had never met McGurk. He trashed former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as \u201cdumb as a rock\u201d for saying in May that an unprepared Trump was outwitted by Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin at a global summit in 2017.\n\nLast month, Trump forced the resignation of Bolton over broad policy disagreements, then aligned himself publicly with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un over his dislike for the former White House aide. At a Washington think tank last week, Bolton eviscerated Trump\u2019s North Korea strategy as naive and dangerous, suggesting the president was preoccupied with summit-meeting photo ops with Kim. He stopped short of personally criticizing Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Trump suggested last year that some in the administration were committing treason after an anonymous senior official wrote in the New York Times that aides were quietly working to protect the country against his reckless tendencies.\n\nAD\n\nAmid the impeachment inquiry, Trump has sought to close ranks, ordering a sizable reduction in the staff of the National Security Council, according to Bloomberg News. White House officials said it was an attempt to streamline decision-making.\n\nBut others interpreted the move as more evidence that a president distrustful of the government he oversees is determined to rely on his own judgment almost exclusively. As if to underscore that concern, Trump boasted Monday of his \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d in defending his Syria decision.\n\nAD\n\nBryan McGrath, a retired naval officer who helped organize the first \u201cNever Trump\u201d letter in 2016, said GOP national security veterans are deliberating over how to \u201creengage in a big way\u201d ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nDuring his time in the Navy, he was trained that his commander \u201cwas to be obeyed,\u201d and current officers have a similar responsibility, he said. But now out of uniform, McGrath said he feels compelled to speak out.\n\n\u201cThis is a unique, deep and long-lasting threat,\u201d he said.", "description": "In a pitched political environment, those who have come forward said they are determined to make clear that Trump\u2019s conduct falls well outside the institutional boundaries of the presidency.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-IaSgR3wfs4jLfhrjahqWm7zP_o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WTH6DFXKCQI6THDNINVA35HTDU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
