Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the coalition, says the F-15E fighter jet strikes were pre-planned and destroyed ammunition stored at the Lafarge Cement Factory.\n\nHe says all coalition personnel and \u201cessential tactical equipment\u201d had left the base before the strike.\n\nMost of the 1,000 U.S. forces in Syria are being withdrawn over the coming days and weeks because of the Turkish invasion into northern Syria and the attack on Kurdish forces.\n\n__\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nPresident Donald Trump described former Defense Secretary James Mattis as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d during a meeting with Congressional leaders Wednesday to discuss Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a Democrat familiar with the meeting who offered a readout of the contentious meeting on condition of anonymity.\n\nTrump, according to the person, was presented at one point with a quote from Mattis warning of an Islamic State group resurgence if the U.S. does not continue to apply pressure.

Those officials say some Syrian Kurdish forces have moved north to fight Turkish troops who launched an attack across the border against the Kurds. The U.S. officials say other Kurds have stayed to guard the detention centers that hold thousands of IS militants.\n\nThe officials say the U.S. doesn\u2019t have good on-the-ground information about what\u2019s going on in some of the detention centers as American forces pull back from the border region.
