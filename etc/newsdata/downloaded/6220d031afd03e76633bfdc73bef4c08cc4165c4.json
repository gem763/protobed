(AP) - Joe Burrow passed for 293 yards and three touchdowns, and fifth-ranked LSU scored three straight touchdowns after falling behind early in the second half to emerge with a 42-28 victory over No. 7 Florida on Saturday night.\n\nFacing a Florida defense that came in leading the nation in interceptions and leading the Southeastern Conference in sacks, the Tigers (6-0, 2-0 SEC) totaled 511 yards without giving up a sack or committing a turnover.\n\nJa\u2019Marr Chase had 127 yards receiving and the last of his two touchdowns was a 54-yarder to give LSU a two-score lead with 5:43 left. Justin Jefferson caught 10 passes for 123 yards and a touchdown.\n\nBurrow, meanwhile, went 21 of 24, meaning he had the same number of touchdown tosses and incomplete passes. Clyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 134 yards and two scores on 13 carries.\n\nThe Tigers still have yet to score fewer than 42 points in a game this season.\n\nKyle Trask was 23-of-39 passing for 310 yards and three touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 3-1), but was done in by freshman Derek Stingley Jr.\u2019s interception in the LSU end zone in the fourth quarter, when the Gators were trying to tie the game. Soon after, Burrow spotted Chase running free down the right sideline, and a Tiger Stadium crowd more than 100,000 strong was in virtual delirium.\n\nFlorida led 28-21 after opening the second half with an eight-play, 75-yard scoring drive that ended with Van Jefferson\u2019s second touchdown catch of the game.\n\nBut LSU tied it less than four minutes later on Edwards-Helaire\u2019s 5-yard run. Tryron Davis-Price put the Tigers back in front with a 33-yard run on LSU\u2019s next possession.\n\nThe first half was played to a 21-all tie with Florida using methodical drives to answer each of the first three touchdowns scored by LSU\u2019s high-octane attack.\n\nLSU\u2019s first touchdown, a 9-yard pass to Chase, took two plays and 32 seconds, starting with Edwards-Helaire\u2019s 57-yard run. The Gators responded with a 12-play drive that took more than six minutes, capped by Trask\u2019s 5-yard pass to Trevon Grimes.\n\nAfter Justin Jefferson\u2019s 7-yard TD catch capped a five-play drive that covered 82 yards in just 2:09, Florida answered with a 13-play drive that consumed nearly seven minutes, ending with Emory Jones\u2019 fourth-and-goal pass under pressure to Lamical Perine, who deftly corralled the ball after it was tipped by linebacker Patrick Queen.\n\nLSU took the lead just 1:29 later when Edwards-Helaire scored on a 39-yard run, and Florida tied it again with an 11-play drive that finished with Van Jefferson\u2019s first touchdown on a 6-yard pass from Trask.\n\nPOSSESSION DISPARITY\n\nWhile Florida methodically ground out four 75-yard scoring drives, including three that lasted at least 11 plays, LSU struck quickly. The result was a significant disparity in time of possession that was bound to exhaust LSU\u2019s defense. The Gators wound up possession the ball for 38:19, while LSU had the ball for 21:41.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nFlorida: It\u2019s hard to question\u2019s Trask\u2019s toughness or poise. He did not appear bothered by the knee injury he played through last week, and composure was evident in his first SEC road start at one of the loudest and difficult places for a visiting team to play in college football. The offense rarely failed to get plays off cleanly and Trask threw accurately and scrambled effectively when needed.\n\nLSU: While the offense remained prolific against the best defense it\u2019s faced this season, the Tigers\u2019 defense had its share of struggles for the third time in as many games against a major conference opponent. Second-half adjustments produced more pressure on Trask, who was sacked twice. That helped the Tigers pull away late and hold on.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFlorida: Visits South Carolina.\n\nLSU: Visits Mississippi State.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joe Burrow passed for 293 yards and three touchdowns, and fifth-ranked LSU scored three straight touchdowns after falling behind early in the second half to emerge with a 42-28 victory over No. 7 Florida on Saturday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/12/florida_lsu_football_04232_c0-99-2369-1480_s1200x700.jpg?98deeecc35d7b3f305067cbfd1db10f45a5e5ad5", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
