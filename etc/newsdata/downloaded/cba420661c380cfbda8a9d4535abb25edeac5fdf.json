The military campaign against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq seems to have been decisive and successful, resulting in the capture of nearly all of the group\u2019s territory and the death of its leader. There is no evidence that Trump's election increased the threat from jihadist terrorism, or caused large numbers of American Muslims to radicalise. Not least, the security agencies that are responsible for catching terrorists and disrupting terrorist plots remain strong and continue to do their jobs. At the operational level, there is far more continuity between Trump and his predecessors than one would suspect.\n\nYet, despite what seems like good news, there are many indicators that Trump\u2019s war on terror is short-sighted, un-strategic, and will \u2014 ultimately \u2014 increase threats from terrorism.\n\nIn Syria and Iraq, for instance, the U.S president has allowed his generals to take greater risks and hastened the destruction of the Caliphate. But he also abandoned America\u2019s Kurdish allies and refused to take any responsibility for the aftermath. As a consequence, major cities like Raqqa lie in ruins, while Islamic State is quietly returning to towns and refugee camps.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has claimed that immigration vetting is \u201cgetting tougher each month.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, his admiration for strongmen has fuelled tensions and empowered jihadists. The best example is Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, whose policies have increased sectarianism, heightened the risk of regional war, and turbocharged jihadist proxies. Thanks to the Saudis\u2019 disastrous military campaign, Yemen\u2019s jihadists are the best-equipped in the world.\n\nThe most cynical part of Trump\u2019s counter-terrorism doctrine has been the systematic conflation of terrorism, immigration and Islam. While popular with his supporters, the effectiveness of the Muslim travel ban is completely unproven. According to a study by RAND, nearly three-quarters of the 178 jihadists who planned or executed attacks against the U.S. between 2001 and 2017 were U.S. citizens. American jihadism has not just been relatively rare, but also predominantly homegrown.\n\nEqually questionable is his idea of \u201cextreme vetting.\u201d Since taking office, Trump has claimed that immigration vetting is \u201cgetting tougher each month.\u201d But there is little evidence that it has fundamentally changed \u2014 or needed fixing in the first place.\n\nThe only tangible initiative has been the creation of a new bureaucratic structure, the National Vetting Center, which immigration experts say duplicates existing efforts.\n\nArguably, none of these initiatives were about countering terrorism to begin with. As well as energising his supporters, Trump\u2019s talk about \u201cradical Islam\u201d and the need to \u201ckeep Muslims out\u201d sought to project a different idea of America. Instead of being a \u201cnation of immigrants,\u201d it echoed the radical agenda of far-right advisors such as Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, who regard immigration as a threat.\n\nThis also explains why Trump has been so complacent about the surge of white nationalism. Even before the deadly attacks in El Paso in August, in which 22 people were killed, violent attacks against minorities had grown steeply.\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, 2018 saw the highest number of \u201cright-wing extremist murders\u201d in any year since 1995, when Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in Oklahoma City.\n\nNot least, Trump supporters have been responsible for nearly a dozen attacks and attempted attacks \u2014 in many instances referencing the president\u2019s name, his policies or campaign slogans.\n\nInstead of protecting America, Trump's actions and rhetoric have left the country more divided and vulnerable.\n\nTrump did not cause these attacks, but he has refused to describe them as acts of terrorism, and never credibly distanced himself from white nationalists and the alt-right. Most worryingly, he has actively promoted the extreme-right\u2019s narratives of \u201cinvasion\u201d and \u201cwhite genocide,\u201d while cutting government programs that were designed to counter them.\n\nWhatever the administration\u2019s accomplishments in the war on terror, they were achieved not because of Trump, but largely despite him. Instead of protecting America, his actions and rhetoric have left the country more divided and vulnerable.\n\nIt may not look like it today, but Trump\u2019s war on terror is not a success, but one of his greatest failures.\n\nPeter R.
