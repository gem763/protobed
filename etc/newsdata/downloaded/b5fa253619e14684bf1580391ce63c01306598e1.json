Corporate leaders should be having a public dialogue about it. Not because everything in Saudi Arabia is perfect \u2014 but precisely because everything is not.\u201d\n\nGlobal banks and consultants are vying for business around the hotly anticipated initial public offering of state oil giant Aramco, the world\u2019s most profitable company.\n\nThe kingdom plans to list as much as five percent of Aramco, which analysts say could be worth between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion.\n\n\u201cLast year, some international businesses thought it was better to avoid sending top level representation as it was so close in the aftermath of the Khashoggi affair,\u201d said Ghanem Nuseibeh, founder of London-based consultancy Cornerstone Global Associates, who has vigorously defended the kingdom\u2019s stand on the killing.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2026 the optics are no longer seen as a reason to boycott such an important event. Global businesses want to do business in Saudi and Saudi is inviting (them) with open arms.\u201d\n\nBut the organisers are not inviting media scrutiny. The FII website has not listed its speakers, saying only that it will \u201cbring together decision makers, leading investors and global experts\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Quietly returning \u2013\n\nThe CIA has reportedly concluded that the crown prince, who controls all major levers of power in the Saudi government, likely ordered the gruesome killing.\n\nPrince Mohammed has said that he accepts responsibility, because it happened \u201cunder my watch\u201d \u2014 but denied having prior knowledge.\n\nSome global companies seeking to sidestep any reputational risks of doing business with Saudi Arabia will avoid the conference but are likely to pursue meetings on the sidelines, observers say.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are quietly returning to their profit-making activities in Saudi Arabia, but they remain on the hook for their own human rights responsibilities,\u201d said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe global fallout over Khashoggi\u2019s killing rendered Prince Mohammed a pariah, testing alliances with Western powers and casting a shadow on his ambitious reform agenda aimed at weaning the kingdom off its dependence on oil.\n\nRiyadh has struggled to attract the foreign investment it needs, especially since a 2017 crackdown when the palatial Ritz-Carlton hotel, the venue for the FII, was turned into a five-star prison for hundreds of Saudi business executives and some royal family members.\n\nBut as it attempts to draw a line under the Khashoggi scandal, the government has hosted Western musicians at dazzling entertainment events, eased restrictions on women\u2019s rights and started issuing tourist visas for the first time.\n\nSaudi Arabia recently climbed 30 places to 62nd in the World Bank\u2019s Ease of Doing Business index for carrying out what it called a \u201crecord number of business reforms in the past year\u201d.\n\nBut Cinzia Bianco, Gulf Research Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the kingdom had its work cut out to diversify its economy.\n\n\u201cThe real challenge for Saudi policymakers is to attract long-term investments in non-energy-related ventures,\u201d she said.", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 Dozens of global policymakers and tycoons will attend a Saudi investment summit starting Tuesday, helping the kingdom turn the page", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/80666a_saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-has-sought-draw-line-killing-journalist-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
