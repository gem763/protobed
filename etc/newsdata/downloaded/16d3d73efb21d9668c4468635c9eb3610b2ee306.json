MORE for delivering a good deal for farmers.\n\n\u201cThese are promises made and promises kept by President Trump. President Trump has made clear that he is an ally of corn and soybean farmers as well as ethanol and biodiesel producers. He is fighting for the farmer. This announcement is great news for Iowa, the Midwest and the entire country,\u201d Grassley said on Oct. 4.\n\nGrassley\u2019s team sent a new comment on the EPA\u2019s latest proposal Wednesday morning, saying the EPA would need to ensure biofuels actually get blended into traditional fuels if farmers are to be happy with any proposal.\n\n\"Ultimately, this will come down to trust and implementation at EPA. The ethanol and biodiesel industries have a lot of cause to distrust EPA and that is understandable. But President Trump brokered this deal and any attempt to undermine it from EPA would represent a betrayal of the president. I expect EPA would not do that after all the work that\u2019s gone into this issue,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nCraig Floss, CEO of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said Wednesday that corn farmers feel the new EPA proposal could allow the agency to skirt measures for ensuring ethanol gets added into the fuel supply after some small refineries are exempted from doing so. That mechanism, promised to them before the Oct. 4 announcement, was key to getting their support, he said.\n\n\u201cNo more \u2018Iowa nice.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s \u2018Iowa pissed,\u2019\u201d he told reporters.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) removed positive quotes from Iowa\u2019s two senators from a release with the latest details on its plan to boost ethanol use \u2014 a\u00a0proposal that is now being opposed by Iowa", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/newsletter-grassley_100219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
