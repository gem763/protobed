REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nThe report by the U.N.-backed Principles of Responsible Investing (PRI), representing investors with $86 trillion of assets under management, joins a growing chorus of warnings that forecasts and investments by oil and gas companies are out of sync with the pace needed to meet energy transition targets.\n\nThe International Energy Agency\u2019s central outlook, which underpins many government and business projections, is not aligned with targets set out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius by slashing greenhouse gas emissions, the PRI warned.\n\nFor a graphic on IPR demand, please click: here\n\nScientists view a rise of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in the Earth\u2019s average temperature as a tipping point where climate impacts such as sea-level rise, natural disasters, forced migration, failed harvests and deadly heatwaves will rapidly start to intensify.\n\nPRI released a new forecast which it said \u201caims to fundamentally reset investors\u2019 forward-looking risk management, strategic asset allocation and company engagement.\u201d\n\nThe study, branded the Inevitable Policy Response (IPR), predicts \u201can abrupt and disruptive\u201d government policy response to climate change by 2025, which it expects to be a \u201ctipping point.\u201d\n\nUnder the IPR scenario:\n\n- Oil demand peaks in 2026-2028 and oil in road transport peaks in 2025, much earlier than the IEA\u2019s forecast that does not foresee demand growth stalling before the 2040s.\n\n- Thermal coal, the most carbon-polluting fossil fuel, will be \u201cvirtually non-existent\u201d by 2040.\n\n- Wind and solar power will generate half of the world\u2019s electricity by 2030.\n\n- Internal combustion vehicles are phased out much faster than most outlooks\n\n- Forestation - needed to absorb excess carbon dioxide - is vastly accelerated.\n\nFor a graphic on IPR emissions, please click: here\n\n\u201cWe foresee an inevitable policy response by 2025 that will be forceful, abrupt and disorderly because of the delay,\u201d Fiona Reynolds, chief executive of the PRI, said in a statement. \u201cThis will create considerably greater disruption than many investors and businesses are prepared for today.\u201d\n\nThe Inevitable Policy Response forecast responds \u201cto concerns that financial markets are overly reliant on business-as-usual outlooks \u2013 such as the International Energy Agency\u2019s New Policy Scenario (NPS) \u2013 that assume limited policy response to climate change,\u201d according to the PRI.\n\nFor a graphic on IPR IEA, please click: here\n\nThe IEA\u2019s forecast, PRI said, \u201cassumes the world will glide towards\u201d a 2.7 degree Celsius - 3.5 degree Celsius warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100 \u201cwithout any further climate policy action beyond what has already been announced.\u201d\n\nThis scenario was highly unlikely given \u201cthe human suffering this would result in.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s top oil and gas companies have come under heavy pressure from investors to adapt to the energy transition by lowering their carbon emissions and investing more in renewables.\n\nBP Chairman Helge Lund told Reuters in June that the London-based company would rather see a rapid, orderly phasing out of fossil fuels than a delayed and disorganized transition.\n\nPRI represents 2,600 signatories including most of the world\u2019s biggest investors such as BlackRock, Wellington, CalSTRS, Allianz, Aviva, Amundi.", "description": "Financial markets risk major disruptions by relying on business-as-usual forecasts that underestimate the impact of climate-change policies that are expected to abruptly tighten next decade, a leading group of investors has warned.", "authors": ["Ron Bousso", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432770118&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M004", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
