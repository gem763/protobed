Currently we\u2019re looking just at stocks and averages,\u201d Vakulenko said. \u201cWe could look at other signals like production levels and forecasts for demand growth.\u201d\n\nVakulenko added that the group could start to assess not just the proportion of global oil-demand growth the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could cater for but also the market share left for U.S. shale producers. \u201cSo to react not just to the only measurable number--stock levels--but to what actually creates that number in months and years to come,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Gazprom (MCX: ) Neft is one of Russia\u2019s largest oil producers, and alongside other operators has meetings with the country\u2019s energy ministry to present its own views on supply and demand, the company has no direct input into OPEC+ policy making. Instead, Russia\u2019s Energy Ministry, gives the country\u2019s oil producers voluntary production targets, in accordance with Russia\u2019s commitments under the OPEC+ agreement.\n\nOPEC and its allies are due to meet in December to discuss whether steeper cuts to oil supply will be needed after the current agreement expires in March 2020. has struggled to rise much above $60 a barrel this year despite some of the worst supply disruptions in recent times.\n\n\u201cWe think that this OPEC+ mechanism is very useful for stabilizing the market, for removing volatility from it and it\u2019s beneficial to us too,\u201d Vakulenko said. \u201cThe way central banks act on the economy is the same way OPEC+ affects the oil market. Central banks have become more sophisticated in the way the move money supplies. OPEC+ might start to do the same.\u201d\n\nOPEC+ ministers have acknowledged growing risks to oil demand but have so far given no indication of a change in strategy. The group hasn\u2019t made any official proposals to change the production-cuts deal, according to Russia\u2019s Energy Minister.\n\nWhen asked whether the OPEC+ deal was likely to continue, Vakulenko said: \u201cIt feels like it, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe that the mechanism as such, and the cooperation between OPEC and Russia has been rather fruitful. We\u2019re looking forward to it continuing.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s average daily oil output has exceeded its OPEC+ target for most of this year. In September, the country exceeded its pledged cutbacks again, even after producers made deeper cuts from a month earlier.\n\nOPEC+ faces a \u201cserious challenge\u201d if it wants to defend oil prices next year as it confronts a \u201cdaunting\u201d supply surplus in the first six months of 2020 of about 1.2 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.\n\nHowever, Vakulenko said a slowdown in U.S. shale production will likely increase demand for supplies from OPEC+.\n\n\u201cLong-term we think there will be some pull on OPEC+ crude from the market. U.S. shale is showing some signs of slowing down and demand keeps growing. At the same time it\u2019s likely there may be higher calls on Gazprom (MCX: ) Neft\u2019s crude from within Russia.\u201d", "description": "OPEC+ Deal Would Improve by Including Demand Data: Gazprom Neft", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/oil_2_800x533_L_1412692774.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
