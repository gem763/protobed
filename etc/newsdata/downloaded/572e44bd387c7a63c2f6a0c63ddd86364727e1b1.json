When she leaves next year, the school will close.\n\nLocal residents travel across Irtysh River outside the village of Sibilyakovo, Omsk region, Russia, September 1, 2019. REUTERS/Alexey Malgavko\n\nLike thousands of villages dotted across Russia, the remote Siberian village of Sibilyakovo emptied after the closure of its state-run collective farm following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet planned economy. Jobs dried up and people left in droves.\n\nIn its heyday in the 1970s, Sibilyakovo\u2019s primary school had four classes, each of around 18 children, and a population of 550. Kuchukova has taught at the school for 42 years.\n\nNowadays her house looks out onto abandoned homes on all sides. The village\u2019s population has shrunk to 39 and Ravil Izhmukhametov is the school\u2019s only pupil.\n\nKuchukova has bought a home in the town of Tara about 50 km (30 miles) away. She plans to retire there with her husband at the end of the school year when she thinks Izhmukhametov will be old enough to travel to the neighboring village for lessons.\n\nThe nearest school then will be a 30-minute boat journey across the choppy Irtysh river followed by a 20-minute ride on the school bus.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for him. His parents don\u2019t want to leave (Sibilyakovo) yet and it\u2019s scary to send a little boy like him over the Irtysh, there are such big waves,\u201d she said.\n\nThe village is mainly inhabited by Tatars, a Turki\u0441 group that is one of scores of ethnic minorities in Russia.\n\nIzhmukhametov\u2019s parents are farmers and have livestock but they don\u2019t want their son to stay in the village when he grows up. \u201cOur eldest children live in the city and we\u2019re happy about that,\u201d said Dinar Izhmukhametov, 48.\n\nThe son, Ravil, says he has no interest in moving to the city, but that he realizes he will have no choice one day.\n\nHe was nonplussed when asked what it was like to go to school without any classmates. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to compare it to, but of course I\u2019d like to have friends so I\u2019m looking forward to going to the main school.\u201d\n\nLooking back on her decades-long career, Kuchukova is sad that the school where she worked for more than four decades will soon close its doors for good.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019ll stand there just like in the neighboring villages, not needed by anyone, while people in the city can\u2019t find places for their children at kindergarten and are queuing up from the moment they\u2019re born,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd even when she herself finally goes to live in Tara, she won\u2019t leave her past behind.\n\n\u201cMy parents are buried here, a part of me is here. We\u2019ll spend every remembrance day here when people come to remember those who have passed away... We\u2019ll come to look after the graves.\u201d", "description": "Uminur Kuchukova, 61, could have retired years ago, but she continues to teach at this dying Russian village's once bustling school for the sake of its last pupil, a 9-year-old boy.
