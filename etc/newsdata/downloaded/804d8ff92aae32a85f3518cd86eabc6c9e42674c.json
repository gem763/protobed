(Maria Alejandra Cardona/Reuters)\n\nIn a city where waterways act like a sponge for the Atlantic Ocean, Gloria Christensen feels like she hasn\u2019t slept in a week as she worries that Hurricane Dorian could flood her neighborhood for the second time in less than two years.\n\nChristensen just moved back into her house in June after completing a $200,000 renovation to repair damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017, which pushed the St. Johns River out of its banks and triggered one of the worst floods in Jacksonville\u2019s history. Now, with Dorian expected to hit Jacksonville on Wednesday, Christensen is leaving home again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stressed, and it\u2019s almost like I have PTSD,\u201d said Christensen, referring to post-traumatic stress disorder, as she prepared to evacuate her house in Jacksonville\u2019s San Marco neighborhood. \u201cI have knots in my stomach, and I\u2019m just worried about what I need to do to prepare again.\u201d\n\nAcross much of the nation\u2019s Southeast coast, residents and officials are expressing similar fears as the threat posed by Dorian shifts from extreme wind to the power of water slapping against coastal communities from Florida to North Carolina.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center nudged the forecast track even closer to the Carolinas, raising the risk of a potential landfall there Thursday. But even if the storm remains offshore, forecasters say Dorian could push tremendous amounts of water into bays, rivers and tributaries.\n\n\u201cThis creates the possibility of dramatic flooding in the Lowcountry,\u201d South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nFloodwater inundated the San Marco neighborhood of Jacksonville, Fla., in the wake of Hurricane Irma in September 2017. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDorian is threatening the region after three consecutive years of punishing East Coast hurricanes, including Hurricane Florence last year and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. Some residents have yet to recover from those storms, a situation that has yielded more anxiety and heightened the debate over rising sea levels.\n\nIn Charleston, S.C., the National Weather Service expects water in the city\u2019s harbor to rise more than 10 feet early Thursday, which would be the second-highest tidal flood recorded there. In Savannah, Ga., the ocean could rise more than 11 feet during two consecutive high tides, which would bring the third-highest flood on record. In northeastern Florida, officials warned that 15- to 25-foot waves could even carve out new inlets on barrier islands near St. Augustine and Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cIt happened during Matthew, and it happened during Irma. And we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we don\u2019t have significant overwash or another opening,\u201d said Al Sandrik, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service\u2019s Jacksonville office.\n\nUnderscoring the risks, Jacksonville officials have urged 256,000 residents to leave their homes. Besides coastal flooding, the city is vulnerable to flooding along the Intracoastal Waterway, the St. Johns River and estuaries that can extend dozens of miles inland.\n\n\u201cWater is dangerous. . . . If it starts coming into your home, it can be very scary,\u201d Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) said Tuesday while urging residents in low-lying areas to evacuate. \u201cWhen it starts coming into your home, you cannot win that battle.\u201d\n\nJacksonville residents don\u2019t have to think far back to recall just how bad the flooding can get here. During Hurricane Irma, a persistent south wind combined with days of heavy rainfall to flood the St. Johns River, which essentially cuts the city in half.\n\nAt its peak, the river rose about six feet, flooding nearly 1,000 properties in downtown and in neighborhoods along its bank. It was the city\u2019s worst flood since 1846, Sandrik said.\n\nBut because of Dorian\u2019s expected track offshore, Sandrik cautioned that officials do not believe the St. Johns River will flood downtown Jacksonville this time. The river flows south to north, and Dorian is expected to produce a primarily northern wind over the city. That should push the river water south, elevating the river flood threat in St. Johns and Putnam counties while sparing Jacksonville\u2019s downtown, Sandrik said. The bigger threat to Jacksonville is an expected storm surge as high as seven feet along the coast, and a 2- to 4-foot water rise in the Intracoastal Waterway, Sandrik added.\n\nStill, residents who live along the riverbank said they were taking the threat of flooding seriously. At the River Road apartment complex in Jacksonville\u2019s San Marco neighborhood, Dan Mackey, 70, recalled how he was wading in chest-deep water when Irma hit. Despite the evacuation order, Mackey said that he plans to remain in his second-floor apartment for Dorian but has stockpiled more storm supplies than he did for Irma.\n\n\u201cWe have 57 apartments here, and we lost 57 air conditioners during Irma,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cIrma was clearly our wake-up call.\u201d\n\nIn San Marco\u2019s retail district, which is home to high-end shops and restaurants, business owners spent the weekend piling up sandbags in front of doors and windows.\n\nDan Hileman, the owner of the White Magnolia gown shop, was elevating dozens of wedding dresses Tuesday. Hileman, 34, was also trying to fortify his business by using metal sheeting, silicone and duct tape on doorways.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we don\u2019t get anything, but if the water does come up, it will only be our floors and drywall, and not our merchandise,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Charleston, residents and businesses throughout downtown also were bracing for possible inundation.\n\nSarah Johnson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s Charleston office, said the flood forecast in Charleston Harbor is just two feet lower than the storm surge produced by Hurricane Hugo, a Category 4 storm, in 1989.\n\n\u201cOnce you get above eight feet, you see widespread flooding across downtown Charleston, and many roads flooded and impassable,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nEven though Dorian has weakened to a Category 2 hurricane, forecasters note that the storm was a Category 5 storm when it stalled over the Bahamas last weekend. As Dorian\u2019s pressure dropped and winds topped out at 185 mph, it churned up the Atlantic Ocean. Some of that water is now being pushed toward the Southeast coast.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t focus too much on the fact it is weakening in terms of category,\u201d Johnson stressed, adding that the water levels could become even higher than predicted if the storm produces heavy coastal rainfall.\n\nAs is the case in Jacksonville, Charleston officials are bracing for another flood before they have finished cleaning up from the last one. The city is surrounded by water on three sides, and in recent years it has battled flooding from heavy rain as well as rising tides.\n\n\u201cA storm the magnitude of Dorian presents so many challenges for any community, but it also accentuates the challenges we live with day in and day out,\u201d said Mike Seekings, a Charleston City Council member and downtown resident.\n\nSeekings said Charleston has endured \u201csunny day floods,\u201d caused by tidal flooding, 30 to 40 times this year.\n\n\u201cAnd the tides are often higher and last longer then we had predicted, which is making everyone concerned,\u201d Seekings said. \u201cIt\u2019s predictably unpredictable, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nWith Dorian, Seekings said the combination of eastern winds, storm surge and a high tide is elevating concerns that it may take days for the water to recede.\n\nChelsea Shope, 27, a second-year medical student who lives in downtown Charleston near the Medical University of South Carolina, was making plans Tuesday to move her car out of town.\n\n\u201cLast year, I left my car parked outside of our house during a rainstorm that hit at high tide, and water was up to my Honda Civic\u2019s windows \u2014 completely totaled it,\u201d Shope said. She has already become used to walking to class \u201con tiptoes so knee-high water doesn\u2019t go down my boots.\u201d\n\nIn Jacksonville, Curry said he also believes sea levels are rising.\n\nLast week, a city task force completed a study on ways the city can reduce its exposure to flooding, Curry noted. The city, working in conjunction with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, has also begun buying out some homeowners who live in especially flood-prone areas.\n\n\u201cPeople can get caught up in the political reasons to why it\u2019s happening but what is important to me is, as it\u2019s happening and we have higher tides, that we are being pragmatic about it,\u201d Curry said.\n\nHunt reported from Charleston, S.C.
