Now they were losing a game and, because of the way it went, forced to confront an all-too-familiar question: Who should round out an otherwise stellar starting rotation?\n\nRoss did not make his best case in a 7-3 loss to the New York Mets at Nationals Park. What he did do, in just 3 2 /3 innings, was allow seven runs on eight hits to help end the Nationals\u2019 winning streak at four. Washington\u2019s offense didn\u2019t do much either, getting nothing off Mets starter Noah Syndergaard in seven innings, going down 16 in a row between the first and the sixth. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s three-run homer in the ninth could only dent the final score.\n\nAnd so the Nationals dropped to 6\u00bd games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East, in a race that\u2019s slipping away, and they may have been auditioning fifth starters as the afternoon wound down.\n\nRoss was followed by Austin Voth and Erick Fedde out of the bullpen. Both are candidates to start, along with Jeremy Hellickson, if the Nationals want to test their options behind Max Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg, Patrick Corbin and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez. Ross\u2019s next appearance, should he make it, would be against the Braves in Atlanta on Saturday. Voth and Fedde, having pitched in the defeat, could also be on regular rest heading into that game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said when asked how he\u2019ll handle the fifth starter spot moving forward. \u201cBut Joe\u2019s been throwing the ball really well. He\u2019s had one bad outing here.\u201d\n\n[Juan Soto is improving his defense one step at a time]\n\nBefore Ross\u2019s ERA ballooned to 6.17, and before the Nationals couldn\u2019t touch Syndergaard, the 7 Line Army, a big band of traveling Mets fans, filled the stadium with unwelcome noise. When these teams faced off in New York three weekends ago, and the Mets took two out of three, Citi Field sounded like the inside of a crashing wave. Sellout crowds serenaded a pair of late rallies against the Nationals\u2019 bullpen. Strasburg mentioned, not so subtly, that he hoped Washington fans were watching, \u201c\u2019cause it gets into crunchtime and those things really carry teams and get us to the next level.\u201d Juan Soto later hinted in Chicago that he hopes for a louder home atmosphere down the stretch.\n\nBut on the second day of September, against another contending club, it was visiting fans who stood out. The 7 Line Army yelled \u201cM-V-P!\u201d when rookie Pete Alonso came to the plate in the first. It booed when Ross attempted a pickoff move in the second. It screamed \u201cLet\u2019s go Mets!\u201d early and often, and over again, and its matching blue shirts stretched through two sections beyond the third base line.\n\nThen the Mets, and Ross, gave those fans every reason to get louder. New York\u2019s first rally included an RBI double for Joe Panik and an RBI single for Rene Rivera. The chants grew when Jeff McNeil hit a two-run homer in the fourth on a first-pitch sinker, and Ross was soon knocked out of the game by J.D. Davis\u2019s two-run double. The Nationals\u2019 lineup was already without Adam Eaton, who returned from a right knee contusion but was lifted after the second inning. Eaton was hit by a pitch in the knee Wednesday and is set to undergo an MRI exam.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned. He got loose, all good, didn\u2019t bother him at all,\u201d Martinez said of Eaton. \u201cAll of a sudden it just kept getting tighter and tighter as a couple of innings went by.\u201d\n\nRoss finished at 85 pitches and never found his command, and his final runner scored once Voth yielded a double to Brandon Nimmo. Ross hadn\u2019t started since Aug. 24, an eight-day layoff, but was 3-0 with a 1.05 ERA in his five outings before this one. The Nationals won each of those games. That all helped Ross win the fifth starter spot over Fedde. He eased concerns of Washington\u2019s rotation depth. He made it seem, at least for the moment, that the Nationals didn\u2019t need to acquire an additional starter at the trade deadline.\n\n[Nationals expand roster with seven September additions]\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the Ross who showed up Monday. Instead, an issue returned in his place. Walks have been his problem all season. Martinez also saw him struggle putting hitters away. He isn\u2019t a pitcher who can live in the strike zone, even when his sinker climbs into the mid-90s, and here was more evidence of what happens when he is forced to. Because he fell into a handful of hitters\u2019 counts \u2014 1-0, 2-0, 2-1 and so on \u2014 he couldn\u2019t bait the Mets with shin-high sinkers and sliders in the dirt. He had to come right at them, and they won.\n\n\u201cJust executing better pitches in general,\u201d Ross said of how he could improve in those situations. \u201cObviously not getting to that point, or if you can, get them to swing at a bad pitch, or just execute something.\u201d\n\nVoth settled in after that Nimmo double and struck out four in 2\u2153 innings. Fedde worked two scoreless innings despite issuing back-to-back four-pitch walks. Hellickson hasn\u2019t started a game since May 19, before he went to the 60-day injured list with a right shoulder strain, but was activated Sunday to eat innings in relief or make a spot start. September roster expansion should allow the Nationals to tinker as they please with the fifth starter, a spot that will come up five more times in the regular season.\n\nNow they just have to decide if Ross gave them enough of a reason to do that.", "description": "Ross allows seven runs in a 7-3 loss to New York, and now Washington must consider whether it wants to explore other options in the final spot in the starting rotation.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-w8dBICevDAyO7e64wnglB18exw=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YPIDSTGNYMI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg"}
