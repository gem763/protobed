But that doesn\u2019t make them any less unpleasant.\n\nAnd they are very unpleasant. A toddler knows no mild disappointment, has no ability to agree to disagree. My daughter digs her heels into the sidewalk to stop the stroller, or goes limp and drops to the ground, screaming with a tearful intensity, as if mourning something as dear to her as she is to me.\n\nAD\n\nAs a parent, I know I have to do something, but what? The obvious, and most consistently successful move (at least in the short term) is to give in. Just shell out the money for the ring pop or the plastic drugstore princess, or let the kid stay up another 20 minutes with the iPad, eating from a salad bowl of candy. The long-term consequences of this approach are real, but those can feel very far off after a long day.\n\nAD\n\nBut often, I do the dreaded part of parenting and play the ambassador of reality. This means saying no to her. And based on my daughter\u2019s response, that sounds very different to her than it does to me.\n\nStalling is not an effective tool for a toddler. When I say, \u201cWe can go to the store in five minutes,\u201d my daughter seems to hear, \u201cWe can never go to the store ever. In fact, everything you like in the store will be destroyed \u2014 forever \u2014 as soon as we pass by it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nReasonable and practical appeals are equally ineffective. \u201cYou\u2019ve already had candy today, and more of it will make you feel ill,\u201d comes across as \u201cI not only fail to understand your body, but also your requirements for joy, and I will always do so, unless I am violently corrected.\u201d\n\nExplaining rarely works. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to go into the pharmacy to, as you put it, just look at toys. We are late to meet your grandparents,\u201d sounds like \u201cI am capriciously ignoring your extremely valid demands, as I will always do, and as the entire world will do, forever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNo wonder she gets so upset. A toddler is only intermittently a rational person. And while the occasional lesson will sink in before things get out of hand, once the kicking and screaming begins, you\u2019ve lost them.\n\nAD\n\nSo here\u2019s what I learned: Don\u2019t say no, at least not at first. Through error and trial, I\u2019ve found two ways to do this without giving in: with an interesting story, or with a tangible alternative. The first one goes a little like this:\n\n\u201cCan we go into the store to get a toy?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know what the toys are made out of?\u201d\n\n\u201cRainbow?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, plastic, actually. And do you know what plastic is made out of?\u201d\n\n\u201cToys?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, dinosaur bones. You see, a long time ago \u2026\u201d\n\nAnd just like that, you and the dinosaurs have filibustered your way past the toy aisle. This isn\u2019t going to work 100 percent of the time. But you can improve your success rate by keeping the narrative close to things the child likes, or things that are within their visual field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOffering an alternative is probably more effective, but it depends on the kid and the situation. And it will cost you something.\n\n\u201cCan we go into the gas station to see what kind of toys they have there?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you know that the supermarket has Popsicles that you\u2019re probably too little to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m too little for them?\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably. Why? Do you want to try one?\u201d\n\nThe point is that, with a toddler, it doesn\u2019t work to say no. Instead of saying \u201cnot this,\u201d or \u201cnot that,\u201d try proposing a vivid and desirable alternative, fictional or otherwise.\n\nThe time to win is later, when your child is calmer. Those little pockets of rational thought offer a good opportunity to revisit the most recent knock-down-drag-out brawl over a unicorn key chain or carnival balloon. You\u2019re a grown-up. You\u2019re responsible. You have good and valid reasons for denying your child when you say no. You can explain those reasons when the kid is calm, and lay the groundwork for the next time you have to say no. As they get older, children get better at understanding things in the heat of the moment. And then their disappointment won\u2019t be accompanied by a sense of panic that the world is a senseless place that holds little regard for their feelings and desires.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, one quiet afternoon about a year ago, my daughter and I had a chance to talk about one of our recent fights. It went something like this.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I said you couldn\u2019t have the iridescent bunny rabbit. And I\u2019m the boss,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cBut one day, will I be the boss?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cMaybe, probably. In a long time, if you act right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d she said, and paused, a new possibility opening in her mind.\n\nThe not-saying-no approach has recently become something I lean on less. My little girl is 4 now. She\u2019s harder to distract, and more open to logic and other forms of persuasion. She\u2019s gotten wiser to my tricks and picked up a few of her own. And so this little arms race goes on and on.\n\nAD\n\nThe most important thing I\u2019ve learned from arguing with her during her toddler-hood is this: In many ways what a toddler wants isn\u2019t that different from what an older child or even an adult wants. It\u2019s not airtight reasoning or criticism but vivid alternatives that most often triumph. In many ways, it seems, we\u2019re all like toddlers: Much less interested in winning the argument than in having somewhere interesting to go.\n\nAD\n\nColin Dodds is a writer who lives in New York City with his wife and daughter.
