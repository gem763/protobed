We\u2019re having a prayer vigil tonight ... we will handle this one day at a time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you say to the people who say they need more than prayer to prevent something like this from happening?\u201d Gibson pressed. Turner told him: \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be evil people. Evil people find ways to hurt people.\u201d\n\nGibson pointed out that an assault rifle was used in the El Paso mass shooting in early August that killed 22 people, and that one was used by the Odessa shooter. \u201cIsn\u2019t there something common in all of this?\u201d\n\nTurner answered: \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem of the heart, to be honest with you. We have some of the most violent video games that you can see.\u201d President Donald Trump blamed \u201cgruesome and grisly\u201d video games after the El Paso attack for helping to instigate mass shooters, echoing other Republicans\u2019 claims despite no credible evidence.\n\nTurner was asked about looser gun laws that went into effect in Texas Sunday. They will allow firearms in public places like schools and churches, as well as foster homes and rental properties. \u201cSome of these will allow schools to be protected even more,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBut as far as the total of the laws, I haven\u2019t seen those. I\u2019ve been a little busy.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said in a brief interview with the Washington Post the day of the shooting: \u201cThere are a lot of people hurt and a lot of people scared. In a situation like this, prayer is the most important thing.\u201d\n\nCheck out the interview in the video up top.
