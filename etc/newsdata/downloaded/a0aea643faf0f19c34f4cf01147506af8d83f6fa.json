Starting this year they became the largest living generation in the U.S.\n\nCompared with their dismal retirement finance prospects, those currently in or close to retirement would seem to be living on Easy Street.\n\nAt least that is the depressing conclusion I draw from recent research into the situation millennials will likely face when they begin to retire around 2050.\n\nThis research, which began circulating on the Social Science Research Network in early July, is entitled \u201cHow Will Retirement Saving Change by 2050? Prospects for the Millennial Generation.\u201d Its authors are William Gale, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution; Hilary Gelfond, a graduate student at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard; and Jason Fichtner, a senior lecturer at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe researchers first focus on the advantages millennials have as they save and invest for their retirement, relative to previous generations. They then enumerate their relative disadvantages, and it\u2019s no contest. The list of those disadvantages is far longer.\n\nWhen it comes to the advantages, the researchers could come up with just one: Millennials as a group are more educated than any previous generations, which should translate into significantly greater earning potential.\n\nThe researchers also point to a second potential advantage, but in the end it turns out to be a double-edged sword: Millennials as a group are healthier and thus should be able to work until a more advanced age than previous generations. That, in turn, should enable them to save and invest more for their retirement. The double-edged sword is that millennials are also likely to live longer than previous generations, and thus must fund a longer retirement. These two effects could very well cancel each other out.\n\nNow the disadvantages. Note carefully that these are \u201crelative\u201d disadvantages when compared with previous generations:\n\n\u2022 Millennials\u2019 \u201ccareers have gotten off to a rocky start because of the financial crisis\u2026 and the ensuing slow recovery over the subsequent few years.\u201d As a group, therefore, they are not exploiting the full potential of the theoretical advantage afforded them by their greater educational attainment.\n\n\u2022 To a greater extent than prior generations, millennials will be employed in \u201ccontingent jobs\u201d\u2014the gig economy\u2014that provide little or no automatic enrollment in, or contributions to, any retirement programs.\n\n\u2022 Partly because of these first two disadvantages, and also because they have more student debt than prior generations, millennials have lower net worths than previous generations. This is illustrated in the accompanying graph; the median net worth of the 25-35 cohort is today some 40% less (in constant 2016 dollars) than for the comparable cohort in 2001\u2014a huge decline.\n\n\u2022 Millennials are marrying, buying homes, and having children later in life than previous generations. These life decisions impact retirement savings in a couple of ways. One is behavioral: People often \u201cfeel the need to \u2018get settled\u2019 by purchasing a house and raising children before beginning to think about saving for retirement,\u201d as the researchers write. Another is that, by buying a house at a later age, there is less time before retirement for it to appreciate.\n\n\u2022Millennials will inevitably feel the financial burden of whatever the government does to make up funding shortfalls facing Social Security and Medicare. As has been widely discussed, for example, the Social Security trust fund is currently slated to run out of money in 2034, at which point it will be able to pay just 79 cents of every dollar that is otherwise obligated. That comes a decade or more prior to when the millennial generation enters retirement, of course. By definition, any solution to that shortfall will involve either higher taxes, lower benefits, or both.\n\n\u2022 Millennials face a future with lower rates return and economic growth than in the past. I have discussed this in prior columns, of course. But to the extent future equity returns are lower than in the past, millennials will find it that much more difficult to build up adequate retirement portfolios even if they didn\u2019t face all the other disadvantages enumerated above. And if interest rates are low when they retire and try to annuitize some of their assets, they will find that the annuity payouts are that much lower.\n\n\u2022 Greater inequality. This is a disadvantage because it means that, unless a millennial is among the generation\u2019s very wealthiest, chances are greater that he or she will be among the very worst off. This is where average numbers can paint a misleadingly sanguine picture. For example, the researchers report, the net worth of the bottom 25% of the age 25-35 cohort fell from minus $1,200 in 1989 to minus $5,000 in 2007 and to minus $20,000 in 2016 (all in constant 2016 dollars).\n\nA pretty sobering portrait, isn\u2019t it? As the researchers put it, in their highly refined academicese: \u201cThere is clearly cause for concern.\u201d\n\nIs there anything special that millennials can do to overcome these challenges? No. The retirement finance options available to them are no different than those available to previous generations. All that retirement planners can suggest is to pursue those options to the maximum extent possible.\n\nIt\u2019s like being told to go fight a new war with the weapons of the previous one.\n\nOf course, realizing that subsequent generations face overwhelming retirement finance challenges doesn\u2019t mean that those currently in or close to retirement suddenly become better off than before\u2014in any material sense. But perspective does play a crucial role in our outlooks.\n\nAnd as we contemplate what the millennial generation will face when they retire in 2050, we may very well choose to reframe what we otherwise consider to be a crisis into a situation for which we can be thankful.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.
