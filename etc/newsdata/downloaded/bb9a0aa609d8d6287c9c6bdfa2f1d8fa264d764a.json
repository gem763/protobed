And so it went, a few weeks back, when Franzen published a New Yorker essay wondering if we should give up hope of decisively averting the climate apocalypse. Something about the sheer Franzenness of Franzen makes it hard for his critics to focus on what he\u2019s actually saying: he was attacked as a nihilist and a fatalist, even though he urged action and investment to combat global warming; and the New Yorker was chastised for not assigning the piece to a climate scientist, even though the relative impotence of public pronouncements by climate scientists was central to his argument. It was difficult not to interpret the ferocity of the response as evidence that he\u2019d broached a subject many would rather avoid.\n\nLost in the commotion was what I\u2019d say was Franzen\u2019s most important reminder: that our capacity for concern is finite, and we ignore that finitude at our peril. Each of us has limited time, energy and other resources, and so, inevitably, if your sole priority is achieving victory in a planetary-scale existential battle, there\u2019ll be nothing left for anything else. \u201cKeep doing the right thing for the planet, yes,\u201d Franzen wrote, \u201cbut also keep trying to save what you love specifically \u2013 a community, an institution, a wild place, a species that\u2019s in trouble \u2013 and take heart in your small successes.\u201d They needn\u2019t be explicitly climate-related, either. There\u2019s something wrong with a moral code that says you shouldn\u2019t spend your spare time caring for a dying relative (say) because it\u2019s time you could have spent saving the environment.\n\nYou might object, of course, that real-life climate activists don\u2019t neglect their dying grandparents; they manage to attend to both demands. But then you\u2019ve already granted Franzen\u2019s point \u2013 that it\u2019s justifiable to withdraw some of your finite energy from what seems like the only global priority in order to reinvest it locally, and on what matters most to you.\n\nMembers of the Uptighterati hate lateness: are we wrong? | Oliver Burkeman Read more\n\nMore than justifiable, in fact: it may be the only way to avoid paralysis or despair in the face of the world\u2019s problems. In the smartphone age, as David Cain observed recently on his blog raptitude.com, our limited capacity for concern is distributed over so many urgent demands that it\u2019s like \u201creleasing a tiny drop of water on each square inch of a forest fire\u201d. Imagine, he wrote, if you could gather up all the public concern and distribute it differently, so that several thousand people would make one specific issue \u2013 or sub-issue, in the case of the climate \u2013 their primary moral concern for a decade. It\u2019s hard to imagine more progress wouldn\u2019t be made.\n\nWe can\u2019t engineer the world that way, obviously. But we could probably try harder, as individuals, to pick a handful of battles in which to invest our finite concern. The trickiest part would be ignoring all the others. \u201cNot my problem!\u201d we\u2019d have to think, when encountering a story about Syrian refugees, or fires in the Amazon. Not from callousness, but because we\u2019d nominated some different problems as \u201cours\u201d, and were already busy making a difference.\n\nListen to this\n\nThe veteran ecologist Joanna Macy explores environmental activism as a \u201cdance with despair\u201d on the podcast On Being.\n\noliver.burkeman@theguardian.com", "description": "If your sole priority is achieving victory in a planetary-scale existential struggle, there\u2019ll be nothing left for anything else", "authors": ["Oliver Burkeman"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1d581c64857e22d8a06b53970e5f442cbd3e48/20_36_926_556/master/926.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f642d39f77d5b6e582bc6226cc6bea26", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
