They required the assistance of an on-loan Manchester United player, but Dean Henderson\u2019s error allowed them to make it seven successive victories this Premier League season \u2013 a distinction shared with Chelsea\u2019s class of 2005-06 \u2013 and 16 in total.\n\nThey will be more exhilarating and more explosive but, in one respect, rarely more efficient. For 69 minutes, Liverpool had not mustered a shot on target. The first they did record was both tame and successful. Gini Wijnaldum\u2019s drive was directed at Henderson. It was not the most forceful shot the Dutchman will ever strike but it trickled through the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. Wijnaldum had not scored for his club since his brace against Barcelona and, if this will not be remembered for as long, it amounted to another significant contribution.\n\nIn the battle of the award winners \u2013 Jurgen Klopp was anointed Fifa\u2019s Coach of the Year this week while Chris Wilder won the League Managers Association\u2019s prize \u2013 it seemed as though the points would be shared, but the plaudits would go to Sheffield United.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Another brought them a hard-fought victory and while Henderson later made a terrific save from Mohamed Salah, the damage had been done.\n\nThis was not Liverpool at their most fluent. The chemistry was missing at times. Andy Robertson collided with Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip with Jordan Henderson. When Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Salah huddled over a free kick to hatch a plan, it only resulted in the right-back shooting way over the United goal.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Sadio Mane was guilty of a glaring miss, miscuing a half-volley wide after Virgil van Dijk released him with a chip over the United defence.\n\nThe Senegalese was annoyed Mohamed Salah did not pass to him at Burnley two weeks ago. This time Salah showed his selflessness even, if typically, Roberto Firmino linked the two. The Egyptian found the Brazilian. He picked out Mane, who tried to pick his spot but only hit the post.\n\nUnited could reflect that, for swathes of the game, they looked the likelier scorers. If they camped behind the ball, defending with organisation and concentration, their isolated attacks came laced with menace. Oli McBurnie\u2019s shot was too close to Adrian, Callum Robinson\u2019s past his far post, but they were a menace on the break.\n\nMcBurnie headed over the bar with Adrian in no-man\u2019s land. The goalkeeper fared better by parring Oliver Norwood\u2019s dipping drive. When John Fleck closed in on goal, Robertson made a superb last-ditch challenge. The substitute Leon Clarke squandered a golden chance to equalise and if fortune favoured Liverpool, they made the most of it.", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0continue to contrive to find ways to win, and if some of them qualify as winning ugly, they will not mind.
