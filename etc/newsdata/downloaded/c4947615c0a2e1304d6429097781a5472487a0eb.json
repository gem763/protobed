In addition to being bad business, Spanfeller's actions are morally reprehensible.\"\n\nOn Monday, an editorial director who reports directly to Spanfeller, sent a memo to writers demanding that they \"write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\" The editorial staff, led by Petchsky, defied the order by placing all of their non-traditional \"sports\" coverage front-and-center on its site Tuesday.\n\nSome of the prominently-featured articles included \"Three Good Dogs I Met,\" \"Woman Furiously Shits On Floor Of Tim Hortons, Throws It At Employees,\" \"What Did We Get Stuck In Our Rectums Last Year?\" and, perhaps most notably, \"The Adults In The Room,\" a piece by former Deadspin editor in chief Megan Greenwell that detailed the unfavorable shifts in the company's management since it changed hands.\n\nThe broader G/O staff also recently clashed over auto-play ads on the site and reader experience.\n\nBy Tuesday, Petchsky \u2014 the top editor at the blog \u2014 was fired \"for not sticking to sports.\"\n\nTheisen alleged that management tried to smooth things over with staff after Petchsky's was dismissed. She posted a photo of the meeting:\n\nReaders, sports enthusiasts, and fellow writers quickly took to Twitter to commend the former Deadspin employees for their integrity and courage.\n\n\u2014Otto Von Biz Markie (@Passionweiss) October 30, 2019\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast's Max Tani, a G/O spokesperson said, \"They resigned and we're sorry that they couldn't work within this incredibly broad coverage mandate. We're excited about Deadspin's future and we'll have some important updates in the coming days.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen what the future of the site holds, but Deadspin as we once knew it appears to be gone forever.", "description": "Deadspin \u2014 the beloved sports blog known for unapologetic reporting and straying from traditional sports coverage \u2014 may have seen its final day.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5dba0a02dee0196a1e48e229?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
