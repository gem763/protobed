Andrew McAuley, chief investment officer at Credit Suisse Private Bank, says these investments are relatively less volatile and may provide a \u201cbetter option than simply loading up on equities for income\u201d.\n\nHowever, advisers warn that the illiquid nature of these investments makes them suitable only for those with long-term horizons, and that their risk profile is not suited to conservative investors. To get the balance right, McAuley suggests operating a \u201crisk budget\u201d in the same way a household might put limits on frivolous spending.\n\nFor those willing to take on more risk for higher potential returns, Crowther-Pal says experience really pays at this end of the curve. \u201cNot all early-stage companies will succeed and it is sensible to select a fund manager with a track record of successfully choosing and investing in early and late-stage companies for capital growth over a 10-year period,\u201d she adds.\n\nOwen warns against \u201cretail venture capital funds\u201d with lower barriers to entry, saying they are often \u201criddled with layers of fees and conflicts\u201d.\n\nLower rates may also entice some investors into a strategy that has been unfashionable for some time \u2013 gearing. Jonathan Philpot, a partner at HLB Mann Judd, believes that for people with low debt, the lower cost of borrowing may make gearing into shares or property more feasible since \u201cthe required rate from an investment is not as high\u201d. He believes that borrowing to invest will become more common as investors navigate these uncharted monetary waters.\n\nMedium risk\n\nWhile illiquid alternatives paying a potential premium may attract some investors in the low rate world, the more likely temptation for many dissatisfied cash investors will be equities. Indeed, all the experts canvassed by Smart Investor acknowledged that this was an understandable knee-jerk reaction for anyone hunting for yield.\n\n\u201cFive years ago an investor could have achieved a target rate of return of 6 per cent per annum with an asset allocation of 60 per cent equities and 40 per cent in fixed interest investments,\u201d says Philpot. \u201cNow that would require an asset allocation of 80 per cent equities and 20 per cent fixed interest.\u201d There is obviously more risk with the higher allocation to equities.\n\nWhile many investors may believe it's simple to replace the 4 per cent they once earned on a term deposit with a 4 per cent dividend yield on an Australian sharemarket investment, Philpot says this thinking is flawed. \u201cShares are not term deposits,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes a long time to become comfortable with the volatility of the share market.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat risk is not necessarily mitigated by simply opting for high-dividend blue-chip stock such as the big four banks. Because of Australia's unusual system of franking credits, investors run the risk of being too focused on income return and not enough on the potential for earnings growth, Philpot says.\n\nFor the big four bank stocks, that earnings growth may well be under pressure, meaning even the traditionally safest of listed companies are now less safe. \u201cWith Australian households having a high level of debt, there is not much capacity to borrow further,\u201d says BDO partner Andrew White. \u201cLow credit growth makes banks sensitive to expenses.\u201d\n\nThe big four banks have pointed to squeezed profit margins as a chief reason for holding back some of the RBA\u2019s 25 basis point rate cut, and some analysts, including Morgan Stanley\u2019s banking sector team, are predicting dividend cuts or diminished payout ratios in the near term.\n\nBut for Crowther-Pal, a high dividend-paying stock can be part of a sound capital protection strategy that complements term deposits, as long as the risk is suited to the individual investor and their personal goals and circumstances. Similarly, she suggests that managed funds with an \u201cequity yield objective\u201d or equity-based exchange traded funds may also play a role.\n\nHybrid investment or derivatives combining debt and equity features could also become more tempting. While White makes it clear that hybrids are riskier than term deposits, he says they can form part of a strong, diversified portfolio in the current climate. \u201cHybrids have enjoyed strong returns recently, particularly after the federal election, which confirmed the continued availability of franking credit refunds.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to bank hybrids, Stanford Brown's Owen is not so sure. \u201cBank hybrids are more risky [and] face greater probability of total loss than ordinary bank shares but they pay lower income and have none of the upside of shares. We don\u2019t regard hybrids as a regular long-term asset class,\u201d he says, although he adds that they can be useful in some economic cycles for the purpose of \u201ccapitalising on collapsing credit spreads\u201d. Nonetheless, Pitcher Partners' Stanley says he is seeing strong demand from retail investors for top tier hybrids looking for higher yield.\n\nLow risk\n\nCredit Suisse\u2019s McAuley acknowledges the bind that many investors, especially pre-retirees and others with low-risk profiles, find themselves in. \u201cCash is an unattractive place to be,\u201d he says. \u201cAlso it just has to be accepted that the yield on bonds is low and, given RBA guidance, is likely to stay that way for what could be years.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean bonds should be ignored. \u201cThe often-quoted 10-year Australian government bond yield at 1 per cent is low, but that is only part of the story,\u201d McAuley says. \u201cIncluding state government and corporate bonds [in a portfolio] will enhance the yield on offer [and] investment grade bonds issued by non-cyclical companies have attractive qualities. Aussie dollar issues from government-supported agencies also provide some yield gain.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the outlook for unattractive returns, bonds can play an important safety role in a well-constructed portfolio, he says. \u201cDon\u2019t be turned off bonds by the low yield, you will be glad you have them in a sell-off.\u201d\n\nFor Owen, investment-grade corporate debt is \u201cthe oldest asset class in the world\u201d and one with relatively low risk. That does not extend to \u201cjunk bonds\u201d, however, which he says are below investment grade and should be purchased only by professional investment managers as part of a diversified fund.\n\nAs taking on more risk becomes increasingly tempting in a world of low-return cash, some suggest simply going back to personal finance fundamentals.\n\nFor retirees, that may mean keeping enough assets in cash, or fixed income products, to meet two or three years of expenses to avoid forced selling of long-term equity holdings for income when markets are down.\n\nPaul Moran, principal of Moran Partners Financial Planning, says record low interest means he would not have more than two years of funds in cash as most accounts pay less than inflation. The rest could be held in high-interest savings accounts that can be easily accessed and slightly higher fixed income products, such as low-risk corporate bonds.\n\nFor White, this is a time to take advantage of low rates to pay down debt. \u201cIf you have a variable home loan, the RBA rate cuts mean your mortgage repayments will reduce if your loan provider passes on the cut,\u201d he says. \u201cKeeping your repayments the same as before the cut would allow you to pay down your mortgage at a faster rate.\u201d\n\nAs research house RateCity explains, the average discounted variable rate for someone taking out a $1 million loan in October 2014 \u2013 five years ago \u2013 would have been 5.08 per cent, which works out to monthly principal and interest repayments of $5417. Today the rate is about 4.11 per cent, or monthly repayments of $4,838 \u2013 a difference of $579. These calculations are based on a 30-year loan.\n\nSomeone with the loan who had kept the same repayments since 2014 would cut the loan term by four and a half years (assuming no change in rates from today), says RateCity's Sally Tindall.\n\nStanley agrees that this is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a good time to hasten debt clearance and says increasing competition in the mortgage market means it pays to shop around for better rates.\n\nHe also says it\u2019s time to take a breath, keep calm and stick to the basics of long-term diversification. \u201cThe key is not to overextend, nor overreact to day-to-day gyrations.\u201d Not even one as momentous as a 0.75 per cent cash rate.\n\nAdditional reporting by Joanna Mather and Duncan Hughes.", "description": "RBA cuts and unconventional monetary policy are forcing investors up the yield curve.
