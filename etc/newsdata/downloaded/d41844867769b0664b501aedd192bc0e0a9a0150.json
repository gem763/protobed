Here are the functions that are currently affected. Read more\n\nFor those with very short memories, Windows 10's September update - designed to remedy a crippling bug in the previous update - ended up causing more problems than it fixed. Microsoft was forced to hastily release two security updates in a bid to fix the damage. It was a messy situation - and eerily reminiscent of the infamous 1809 Update debacle from 2018.\n\nNeedless to say, Microsoft is in sore need of a perfect, bug-free update right now. Assuming all goes according to plan, what can users expect?\n\nWhat's new in the Windows 10 October 2019 Update?\n\nAs reported by Windows Latest, the next big update for Windows 10 is expected to land in early October. Code named '19H2\u2032, it will be a substantially smaller update compared to last month's, with an emphasis on performance and reliability over cool new features.\n\nNotable tweaks and improvements include an expanded Start menu when you hover your mouse over it, an updated Lock screen with digital assistant integration, the ability to create Calendar events directly from the Taskbar, a more user-friendly Action Center, more control over notifications and a higher level of power efficiency for laptop batteries. Machines with newer Intel chips should also receive a slight boost to performance.\n\nWhen can I get the Windows 10 October 2019 Update?\n\nThe update has already been pushed out to select Windows Insiders members on the Release Preview Ring. According to Windows Latest, we may see a public rollout on October 3 to coincide with the launch of Microsoft's new Surface laptop range. Once made public, it will install automatically just like a regular patch.\n\nWill it be another clusterf*ck?\n\nFor Microsoft's sake, let's hope not. It's imperative that the next Windows 10 update is smooth and painless for users. Another string of OS-related snafus does not bear thinking about. So, uh, no pressure, guys.\n\nDownload These Windows 10 Updates To 'Un-Break' Your PC Microsoft is having a field day with Windows 10 and by field day, I mean a catastrophe. Subsequent cooked updates have broken and undone previous patches, but a new update is here to hopefully put us at peace once and for all.
