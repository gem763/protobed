REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe NBA is dealing with harsh reaction from its Chinese business partners to a since-deleted tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey related to protests in Hong Kong. The league subsequently apologized for the backlash to Morey\u2019s tweet but backed his ability to take a stand on the issue without speaking for the team.\n\nKerr and Popovich, both vocal critics of Trump\u2019s policies in the past, were asked in recent days for their response to the issue.\n\n\u201cHe was like a little boy, he was so scared. ... He was shaking,\u201d Trump said of Kerr\u2019s reply. \u201cHe was shaking, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know\u2019 ... he didn\u2019t know how to answer the question, and yet he\u2019ll talk about the United States very badly.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kerr had said he didn\u2019t have a reaction to the NBA-China situation, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a really bizarre international story, and a lot of us don\u2019t know what to make of it. So it\u2019s something I\u2019m reading about just like everybody is, but I\u2019m not going to comment further than that.\u201d\n\nPopovich had praised NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s response to the Morey tweet without specifically taking a stand on the issue.\n\nTrump commented Wednesday, \u201cI watched Popovich, sort of the same thing, but he didn\u2019t look quite as scared, actually. But they talk badly about the United States \u2014 but when (they) talk about China, they don\u2019t want to say anything bad.\u201d\n\nWarriors guard Stephen Curry, another longtime Trump critic, said Wednesday at the team\u2019s practice, \u201cI just heard about the Trump thing. I gotta welcome Steve to the club.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, after Curry had announced that he would be opposed to the then-NBA champion Warriors celebrating their title at the White House, Trump tweeted, \u201cGoing to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team. Stephen Curry is hesitating, therefore invitation is withdrawn!\u201d\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "President Donald Trump strode into the NBA's China morass on Wednesday, denouncing the reaction of Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich to the controversy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439050856&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9900M-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
