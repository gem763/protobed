Is that normal?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nAn Alabama fan cheers during the second half of Saturday's game against New Mexico State. (Vasha Hunt/AP)\n\nAt Alabama, where the football is only boring when the home team goes up by six touchdowns, students are being penalized if they leave a game early.\n\nA report Thursday by the New York Times found that the college football juggernaut uses location-tracking technology to support its student loyalty rewards program. The basics are simple, and a bit eerie: Students download the Tide Loyalty Points app, earn 100 points for attending a home game and then get an additional 250 if they\u2019re still in attendance by the fourth quarter.\n\nThe idea is that the incentive of more points will prevent students from leaving games early, something Tide Coach Nick Saban has spoken out against before and returned to this past weekend after Alabama\u2019s 62-10 win over New Mexico State, the second week of the app.\n\n\u201cIf I asked that whole student section, do you want to be No. 1?\u201d Saban wondered, \u201cNobody would hold their hand up and say I want to be No. 4. They would all say No. 1. But are they willing to do everything to be No. 1? That\u2019s another question. You can ask them that. I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\nHey @AlabamaFTBL student section, #NickSaban is calling you out yet again for not staying the entire game.\n\n\n\nDo you want to be #1? #Saban says you didn't act like it. \ud83d\ude02 Listen below. @WBRCnews #RollTide #Bama pic.twitter.com/HoCTnabVtH \u2014 ChristinaWBRC (@ChristinaWBRC) September 8, 2019\n\nAlabama\u2019s system represents an extreme example of a broadly used idea. On a more local level, Maryland employs a loyalty system for football and men\u2019s basketball. In recent years, there has not been much use for the program during football season. With the Terps hanging around the bottom of the Big Ten standings, most students who applied for a football ticket received one with no issues.\n\nBut now that the Terps are off to a 2-0 start and ranked No. 21 in the country, the school\u2019s ticketing system will play an increased role. Penn State is coming to College Park on Sept. 27 and, according to a school spokesman, the athletic department received about 14,500 requests for 10,000 seats as of Thursday evening. When demand exceeds capacity for any Maryland game, a lottery is triggered and a student\u2019s number of entries is determined by loyalty points.\n\nMaryland football has received 13,000 student ticket requests so far for its Friday night matchup vs. Penn State on Sept. 27. Student capacity is 10K.\n\n\n\nThis is the most requests received since they began lottery system in 2002. Only other lottery game was West Virginia in 2007. \u2014 Andy Kostka (@afkostka) September 10, 2019\n\nStudents that had attended both of Maryland\u2019s previous home games had four points, two for each game. Maryland\u2019s system does not incentivize length of stay at the game. Maryland students say that it\u2019s fairly common for friends and classmates to stop by a game, scan their ticket to get in and then quickly leave with their loyalty points intact.\n\n[2-0 Maryland was throttled by Temple last year, but the Terps say everything\u2019s changed]\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, senior Alex Murphy was checking his student ticket account to confirm that he had accrued four points. Murphy had applied to get a Penn State ticket but wasn\u2019t selected.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the school announced it would be adding overflow seating and letting students know by evening if they had been selected in this impromptu second round. Murphy had again heard nothing, a surprise that left him \u201cextremely angry\u201d and confused about how the system worked. He isn\u2019t alone.\n\n\u201cNo one actually really knows how it works,\u201d Maryland senior Marie Hatch said. \u201cWe all just try to make sure we have points and hope that everything goes fine. It\u2019s just a mysterious a system.\u201d\n\nMaryland isn\u2019t the only area school with such a system.\n\nIf you want to attend a football game at Virginia Tech, you enter a simple lottery with no point system attached. Just give your name during the sign-up period and cross your fingers.\n\nBut at Virginia, what are known as Sabre Points are used during men\u2019s basketball season. Demand to see the NCAA champion Cavaliers is high, and if the number of ticket requests exceeds capacity, a lottery is then triggered. The number of entries each student receives in the lottery is determined by their Sabre Points. These can be earned by attending other sporting events at the university.\n\nWhile all three schools lay out the student ticket policies on their athletic websites, the specifics are sometimes called into question, especially with a big game approaching.\n\n\u201cThe [students\u2019] understanding of the system is just what other people tell them,\u201d Maryland junior Aiden Jenkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just hearsay and people telling other people what they know and they tell their friends and so on.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaryland fans celebrate during the Terps' win over Syracuse. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nBy Thursday night, a few hours after he thought his last chance at a ticket had come and gone, Murphy received an email saying that he had received an overflow spot. He wasn\u2019t sure how he had been selected or why it had taken this long. But he\u2019s going to the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all good here,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Maryland or Penn State jumps out to a sizable lead and Murphy decides there are better things to do than watch a rout on a Friday night, no loyalty points will be lost. All that mattered was that he walked through the door. Outside of Tuscaloosa \u2014 at least for now \u2014 that means your loyalty is still intact.\n\nRead more:\n\nGeorgia fans organize last-minute \u2018pink-out\u2019 to honor Arkansas State coach\u2019s late wife\n\nVirginia football is surging, FSU is reeling entering ACC matchup turned upside-down\n\nCalifornia lawmakers voted to let NCAA athletes get paid.
