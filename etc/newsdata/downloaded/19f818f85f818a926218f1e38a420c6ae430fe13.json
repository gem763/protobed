The analyst consensus called for profit of 4 cents a share on sales of $82.2 million, according to FactSet.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 years of aggressively investing in our science and product innovation, this is the first quarter we have generated net income,\u201d Executive Chairman Seth Goldman said in a conference call Monday afternoon. \u201cIt is a wonderful validation from consumers who support our business strategy of building meat directly from plants.\u201d\n\nThe company also increased its annual revenue forecast for the second consecutive quarter, and now expects full-year sales of $265 million to $275 million. In July, the company raised its target to $240 million from $210 million.\n\nBeyond Meat BYND, +4.56% shares, which rampaged to more than $200 in July after an initial public offering in May that priced shares at $25 apiece, fell more than 5% in late trading immediately after the report hit. The stock has retreated since the last earnings report, when Beyond Meat announced a secondary stock offering that eventually sold insiders\u2019 shares for $160 apiece.\n\nEven more Beyond Meat shares could hit the market starting Tuesday, as the lockup period that precludes Beyond Meat employees and early investors from selling their shares ends. While many of those investors were able to sell in the secondary offering, they will now be able to sell more on the open market. Goldman noted the end of the lockup on the call Monday.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize short-term reactions to these milestones are often marked by heightened uncertainty, we believe that Beyond Meat is in a stronger position today than at any other time in its history,\u201d he said.\n\nShares have declined 55% in the past three months, but closed Monday with a 4.6% increase at $105.41, which gave the company a market capitalization of about $6.4 billion. In late trading, shares fell lower than $100 a share.\n\nSince the July report, Beyond Meat has announced new leadership including a chief operating officer who previously worked for Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.13% and a new chief marketing officer from Coca-Cola Co. KO, -0.33% . In summing up the results released Monday, Chief Executive Ethan Brown focused on the logistical and branding opportunities with which those executives will be tasked.\n\n\u201cWe remain focused on expanding our distribution footprint, both domestically and abroad, building our brand, introducing new innovative products into the marketplace, and bolstering our infrastructure and internal capabilities to fuel our future growth,\u201d Brown said in prepared remarks.\n\nIn a separate regulatory filing Monday afternoon, Beyond Meat disclosed that board member Gregory Bohlen resigned as a director last week. Bohlen, managing director for Union Grove Venture Partners, had a seat on Beyond Meat\u2019s board since 2013 and sold more than 72,000 shares in the secondary stock offering while holding on to roughly 725,000 shares.\n\nBrown said the departure had been planned when asked about it in the conference call, and the filing stated that it was not the result of a disagreement with the company nor how it is being run. The board will shrink from 10 members to nine, Goldman said on the conference call.", "description": "Beyond Meat Inc. shares fell in after-hours trading Monday despite an earnings report that showed the company\u2019s first quarterly profit in history.", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
