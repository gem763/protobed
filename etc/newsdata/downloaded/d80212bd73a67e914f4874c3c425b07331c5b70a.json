Of course, it wasn\u2019t hilarious but something has to break the tension.\u201d\n\nNotaro\u2019s diagnosis of cancer in both breasts came after a four-month period during which the comedian suffered a rare intestinal disorder, lose her mother unexpectedly and went through a breakup. A few days after she was told she had cancer, Notaro opened her comedy set at Largo in Los Angeles with: \u201cGood evening, hello, I have cancer. How are you?\u201d \u2014 a line that captivated the audience and cemented Notaro as a comedy great. Since that set, Notaro has channeled the highs and lows of topics like cancer and death into her comedy, offering transparency about her toughest challenges.\n\nComedian Tig Notaro speaks onstage during the TIME 100 Health Summit at Pier 17 in New York City on Oct. 17, 2019.

She later had a double mastectomy and, deciding not to have reconstructive surgery, featured her surgery scars in her 2015 comedy special Boyish Girl Interrupted, which aired on HBO.\n\n\u201cI thought that it was funny to go on stage and take my shirt off and tell jokes that have nothing to do with cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to struggle with [the scars] but then I realized they just represent my body healing and I started to feel empowered by it.\u201d\n\nIn a message directed to people who have not dealt with cancer or other serious health issues, Notaro cautioned against promoting constant positivity to those who suffer from illness. People undergoing treatment or dealing with a disease need to be able to share when they\u2019re in pain or are scared or feel helpless about what to do, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in these places of despair and pain, sometimes you need to be able to speak in that space \u2026 and for people to be able to sit in that moment with somebody and accept that and not try and suffocate them with \u2018You\u2019re going to be okay,'\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Notaro, known for disarming, deadpan-style of comedy, spoke about finding the humor in devastating moments during an interview at the TIME 100 Health Summit", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/time-100-health-summit-066.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
