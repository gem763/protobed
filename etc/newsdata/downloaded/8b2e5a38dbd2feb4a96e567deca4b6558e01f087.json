Chan School of Public Health, shared with Reuters by Dr. Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition, said, \u201cfrom a public health point of view, it is irresponsible and unethical to issue dietary guidelines that are tantamount to promoting meat consumption, even if there is still some uncertainty about the strength of the evidence.\u201d\n\nDr. David Katz, director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center at the Yale University School of Medicine, cited \u201cgrave concerns about the potential for damage to public understanding, and public health.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) both say red and processed meat may or can cause cancer.\n\nThe WCRF advises eating only \u201cmoderate amounts\u201d of red meat, such as beef, pork and lamb - with an upper limit of 500 grams (17.6 ounces) cooked weight per week - and \u201clittle, if any\u201d processed meat.\n\nA panel of experts writing in The Lancet in January outlined an \u201cideal diet\u201d for human health and the planet that said global average red meat consumption should be cut by 50% and consumption of nuts, fruits, vegetables and legumes should double.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A beef steak is cut at the Taberna del Gijon restaurant in Madrid, Spain, July 26, 2017. REUTERS/Paul Hanna\n\nFor the latest analysis, researchers from Canada, Spain and Poland conducted a series of reviews of both randomized controlled trials and observational studies looking at the possible health impact of eating red and processed meat.\n\nAmong the randomized trials they selected for analysis, which included around 54,000 people, they found no statistically significant link between eating meat and the risk of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.\n\nAmong the observational studies, which covered millions of people, they did find \u201ca very small reduction in risk\u201d in those who ate three fewer servings of red or processed meat a week, but said that this association \u201cwas very uncertain.\u201d\n\nBEST APPROACH\n\n\u201cOur bottom line recommendation ... is that for the majority of people, but not everyone, continuing their red and processed meat consumption is the best approach,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSome experts not directly involved with the reviews said the work was a comprehensive, well-conducted analysis of the available evidence on eating meat and human health.\n\n\u201cThis study will, I hope, help to eliminate the incorrect impression ... that some meat products are as carcinogenic as cigarette smoke, and to discourage dramatic media headlines claiming that \u2018bacon is killing us\u2019,\u201d said Ian Johnson, a nutrition expert at Britain\u2019s Quadram Institute of bioscience.\n\nChristine Laine, editor in chief of Annals of Internal Medicine, noted that nutrition studies are challenging as they are usually not randomized controlled trials and often depend on participants\u2019 memories.\n\n\u201cThere may be lots of reasons to decrease meat in your diet, but if you\u2019re decreasing it to improve your health, we don\u2019t have a lot of strong evidence to support that,\u201d Laine said. \u201cTo be honest with our patients and the public, we shouldn\u2019t be making recommendations that sound like they\u2019re based on solid evidence.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nQuadram\u2019s Johnson said people who choose to cut down their meat intake might still improve their health by doing so. \u201cThere are (also) strong environmental and ethical arguments for reducing meat consumption in the modern world.\u201d\n\nEating more plant-based foods can help to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, scientists say.", "description": "Cutting back on red and processed meat brings few if any health benefits, according to a review of studies involving millions of people, a finding that contradicts dietary advice of leading international agencies and raised immediate objections from many health experts.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435701673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1K1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
