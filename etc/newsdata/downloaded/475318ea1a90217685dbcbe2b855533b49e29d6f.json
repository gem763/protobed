In today's terms this would be considered genocide.\n\n'Our Indigenous Elders can find a more suitable name for Stirling Highway, one which embraces life, has some poetry and is connected to country.\n\nIn August this year Perth activist Emily Egerton-Warburton started a petition to change the name of Sterling Highway (pictured)\n\n'It's time to live in right relation with Indigenous people. Let's learn some of their language!\n\nShe then suggested how it should renamed, writing: 'The Waardungmaat (the crow) is a better name.'\n\nThe petition fell flat after only receiving 129 signatures.\n\nMoreton Island\n\nMoreton Island off Brisbane could soon be named Mulgumpin under a native title settlement.\n\nThe Quandamooka people, who inhabited the land before European colonisation, have been negotiating with the Queensland government for four years over their native title rights and interests over land and waters.\n\nMoreton Island (pictured) off Brisbane could soon be named Mulgumpin under a native title settlement\n\nEarlier this month the two parties agreed terms that would establish native title over 98 per cent of the island - and a federal court will make a determination in November.\n\nIn the settlement is a Land Use Agreements, which proposes to rename Moreton Island National Park as 'Gheebelum Coonungai National Park.\n\nCameron Costello, chief executive of the Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation, said he was 'absolutely ecstatic' about the agreement.\n\nYarra River\n\nThis month the Yarra River Business Association put forward the named Birrarung for the waterway.\n\nThe river, which runs for 11km through the heart of the Victorian capital, is known as the Birrarung in the Boon Wurrung and Woiwurrung languages.\n\nThe word means 'river of mists' and is a significant place of shared Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal history and cultural values.\n\nThe Yarra River runs for 11km along river edges and urban settings in the heart of Melbourne\n\nCity of Melbourne Council said it would look to consult Aboriginal groups about the suggested name change, which was one of several recommendations as part of a 'City River Strategy'.\n\n'We did this with Uluru, so why not the Yarra?' Melbourne Water's Kate Nagato said.\n\nTransport and city planning associate Mark Rowland said the council received several recommendations to change the name of the river.\n\nHe said the government established a the Birrarung statutory body in 2018, which already refers more to Birrarung than the Yarra River.\n\nOn Thursday, however, Acting Premier James Merlino said he did not support a name change.", "description": "The Yarra River Business Association put forward the Wurundjeri name to honour the river's indigenous history\u00a0before Acting Premier James Merlino rejected the idea.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/02/20264900-0-image-a-15_1572231269935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
