General Assembly | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Boris Johnson had \u2018no role\u2019 in allocation of public money to American model There was nothing \u2018untoward\u2019 about the award of a grant to Jennifer Arcuri, says minister.\n\nLONDON \u2014 Boris Johnson \u201chad absolutely no role\u201d in the government\u2019s decision to grant a \u00a3126,000 grant to Jennifer Arcuri, an American model turned technology entrepreneur, a government minister said.\n\nDigital minister Matt Warman told the House of Commons that the grant had been awarded \u201cby officials through the proper process.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Times reported on September 22 that Arcuri had been awarded \u00a3126,000 in public money and was given privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Johnson.\n\nAsking an urgent question in the Commons, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said: \u201cThe fact that we are back in the Commons today is because the prime minister has been shown to ride rough-shod over the laws of this land. It would indeed be disappointing if we were to find that the prime minister has form in bending the rules for personal or political gain.\u201d\n\nIn response, Warman said: \u201cThe prime minister and his staff have had absolutely no role in the award of this grant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have no reason to think there is anything untoward in this particular matter,\u201d he added.\n\nShadow culture secretary and Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said it was \u201cvery difficult\u201d to see how the company, registered in the U.S., fulfilled the criteria for the grants. He said the case posed questions about whether Johnson was suitable to occupy high office and disburse public funds.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that our Prime Minister does reckless things. He is a man whose character renders him unsuitable and unfit for the office he holds.\u201d", "description": "There was nothing \u2018untoward\u2019 about the award of a grant to Jennifer Arcuri, says minister.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176919809-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
