Their sole top-20 album, \u201cWaiting for Columbus\u201d (1978), was partly recorded at Lisner Auditorium in the District and later ranked 49th on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s list of the 50 greatest live albums.\n\nMr. Barrere, who sometimes spelled his last name Barr\u00e8re, was not an original member of the band. He originally auditioned as a bassist, while George was searching for someone to play the instrument, and joined as a guitarist in time for the band\u2019s breakthrough third album, \u201cDixie Chicken\u201d (1973). \u201cAs a bassist,\u201d he cracked, \u201cI make an excellent guitarist.\u201d\n\nAlthough he had initially focused on the blues, picking up the guitar after listening to guitarist and harmonicist Jimmy Reed as a 12-year-old, Mr. Barrere expanded into jazz, country and pop, sometimes playing slide guitar. He also wrote or co-wrote many of the group\u2019s songs, including \u201cWalkin\u2019 All Night,\u201d \u201cAll That You Dream,\u201d \u201cTime Loves a Hero,\u201d \u201cOld Folks Boogie\u201d and \u201cDown on the Farm.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to George, a cannonball of a singer who had previously performed with Frank Zappa in the Mothers of Invention, Little Feat\u2019s original lineup featured keyboardist Bill Payne, drummer Richie Hayward and bassist Roy Estrada, who had also played with Zappa and was succeeded by Kenny Gradney beginning with \u201cDixie Chicken.\u201d\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Elijah Cummings, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image John Witherspoon | Actor-comedian John Witherspoon, who memorably played Ice Cube\u2019s father in the \u201cFriday\u201d films, has died. He was 77. The actor had a prolific career, co-starring in three \u201cFriday\u201d films, appearing on \u201cThe Wayans Bros.\u201d television series and voicing the grandfather in \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d animated series. His film roles included \u201cVampire in Brooklyn\u201d and \u201cBoomerang,\u201d and he was a frequent guest on \u201cLate Show with David Letterman.\u201d Read the obituary (Charles Sykes/AP)\n\nThat album also marked the band\u2019s first record with percussionist and singer Sam Clayton, and was followed by \u201cFeats Don\u2019t Fail Me Now\u201d (1974), recorded near Baltimore at Blue Seas Recording Studio. The group completed three more records before disbanding in 1979, shortly before George\u2019s death at 34 amid escalating drug and alcohol use.\n\n\u201cIn my personal life, I was about this far behind Lowell, and if I didn\u2019t watch it, I was going to the same place he was,\u201d Mr. Barrere told The Washington Post in 1988. \u201cBut you couldn\u2019t have told me that at the time, because I was wild and crazy and ready to go.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Barrere performed with blues musician Catfish Hodge in the bands Chicken Legs and the Bluesbusters, and cut a pair of solo albums before Little Feat reunited with the 1988 album \u201cLet It Roll.\u201d He took on a more prominent role as a songwriting and singer that lasted through the group\u2019s latest studio album, \u201cRooster Rag\u201d (2012).\n\n\u201cWhen we do get together and we play these songs, it always brings the best out in you because you bring into it whatever you\u2019ve been doing in the meantime,\u201d Mr. Barrere told the website Best Classic Bands earlier this year, noting that Little Feat had acquired a reputation as a \u201cmusicians\u2019 band.\u201d \u201cThe opportunities are endless as far as soloing . . . I think it\u2019s a testament to the fact that all the cats can play.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of three sons, Paul Barrere was born in Burbank, Calif., on July 3, 1948, and attended Hollywood High School with George. His parents were film and television actors who performed under the names Paul and Claudia Bryar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn his first rock-and-roll tour, promoting \u201cDixie Chicken,\u201d Mr. Barrere was dismayed to find that Little Feat\u2019s album was not being stocked at record stores. \u201cIn Atlanta, we all had to put on busboy outfits and Lowell put on a chicken suit, and we went around to radio stations handing out boxes of chicken that said on them, \u2018Dixie Chicken \u2014 Finger Pickin\u2019 Good,\u2019 \u201d he recalled in the liner notes to the band\u2019s 1981 compilation album \u201cHoy-Hoy!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was strange, funny and degrading,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Barrere recorded or performed with artists including Carly Simon, Valerie Carter, Chico Hamilton, Phil Lesh and Bonnie Raitt, and in recent years toured with fellow Little Feat guitarist Fred Tackett as a duo.\n\nAD\n\nAn early marriage ended in divorce, and in 1988 he married Pam Ruhl. In addition to his wife, survivors include their three children, Gabriel, Genevieve and Gillian Barrere; and a brother.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been a band that plays the songs the same way twice,\u201d Mr. Barrere told the website JamBase in February. \u201cEvery song is a gem, we feel, and we leave ourselves spaces within the songs to improvise. To me, that means space to be a musician. So that\u2019s what we think is important, not play the same songs the same length every night and fire up the wind machine to blow your hair back \u2014 although my hair has left me.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He had an increasingly prominent role after the death of bandleader Lowell George.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/e87RvdbXnzHS_SGTSJ2mIo-9EJo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZYPIKWH3EEI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
