We are the workers\u2019 party.\u201d\n\nShadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Labour offer was worth more to workers, as it would come into effect as soon as the party took power.\n\n\u201cThis pathetic attempt at catch-up by the Conservatives will fool nobody,\u201d said Mr McDonnell.\n\n\u201cLabour will introduce \u00a310 as a minimum as soon as we take office and, rising with living costs, it will mean everybody over 16 years of age will be earning comfortably more than \u00a310.50 an hour by 2024.\u201d\n\nTreasury sources said the rise in National Living Wage would be phased in over the next five years, and the final rate would depend on increases in median wages over that period.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It makes a big difference to 4 million workers.\n\n\u201cIt is the right balance between addressing people\u2019s cost of living and maintaining a good business environment.\u201d\n\nTUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u201dThe Chancellor\u2019s pre-election promise should be taken with a huge bucket of salt. This pledge would be overwhelmed by a no-deal Brexit. If we leave the EU without a deal, jobs will be lost, wages will fall, and our public services will suffer.\u201d\n\nThe general secretary of the Unison union, Dave Prentis, said: \u201cMany people will be wary of the Chancellor\u2019s promises to splash the cash knowing an election is just around the corner.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so easy to conjure up this money now, it\u2019s hard to understand why the government has been running public spending into the ground for a decade. It seems the Tories have been nurturing magic money trees all along.\u201d", "description": "Four million low-paid workers are to gain an average \u00a34,000 a year from a hike in the National Living Wage announced by chancellor Sajid Javid, the Treasury has said.
