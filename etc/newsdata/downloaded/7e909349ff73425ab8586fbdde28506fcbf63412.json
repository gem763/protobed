Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhen Brad Parscale, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, started peddling a Trump-branded Sharpie pen on Friday morning, things for a moment seemed to be returning to what passes for normal now: The frenzied commander in chief was finally steering away from a desperately earnest fight against admitting he inaccurately warned of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s threat to Alabama and back toward a favorite pastime: trolling. Unfortunately, the message\u2014that this branded pen \u201chas the special ability to drive @CNN and the rest of the fake news crazy!\u201d\u2014came much too late. The key to trolling is jeering indifference: You win because you don\u2019t care. To a troll, caring is hilarious and (should you make the mistake of doing it) fatal.\n\nBy that metric alone, Trump cannot be said to have won the week. During this astonishing #Sharpiegate news cycle\u2014a throbbing tumor attached to the real news of a Bahamas devastated by the storm\u2014Trump, who typically lies with fluency and ease, cared so deeply about being fact-checked on this particular matter that his handlers warned the press he\u2019d keep it going as long as they did. Trouble was, Trump cared much more than the press did. Maybe pathologically. He spent the better part of a week doubling down like a hangry gambler on this single claim, sharing old maps of obsolete weather forecasts to find something that would make him right\u2014while Alabama went unaffected and the Bahamas mourned and the Carolinas battened down. He persisted until almost everyone ended up mystified and astounded, shaking their heads the way one does when someone has well and truly lost it.\n\nHere, in case you missed it, is the original claim Trump made on Sunday and continues to defend: \u201cIn addition to Florida\u2014South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d The Alabama part of this was untrue, and the Birmingham National Weather Service immediately corrected the record on Sunday, operating under the understandable assumption that Alabamians receiving accurate information about a looming natural disaster mattered more than the president\u2019s pride. Trump, unaccustomed to correction, disagreed. Since then, it didn\u2019t hit but it could have has become his mantra, as he tweeted about it for days before the Wednesday Sharpie incident that will live in infamy, when he presented an official NOAA map doctored with black ink to make the hurricane appear to be headed toward Alabama.\n\nGet Slate in Your Inbox Slate\u2019s daily newsletter, The Angle, rounds up the stories you need to read.

So clumsy and obvious was the Sharpie-drawn extension that it seemed like a test\u2014how much can I get away with? Authoritarians frequently gauge their subordinates\u2019 loyalties by ordering them to agree to things that are plainly untrue. This is the very first thing Trump did to then\u2013press secretary Sean Spicer, who was forced to publicly defend the president\u2019s claim about crowd sizes at his inauguration despite photographic evidence to the contrary. Spicer obliged, teaching Trump that he could use weak people to help him bend reality as president.\n\nHere\u2019s a theory about why Trump couldn\u2019t let it go this week: One of his staunchest allies didn\u2019t seem to have his back. It may have rattled him. Fox News, which he has recently started attacking for being insufficiently slavish\u2014has let him down. Pundits like Sean Hannity and Geraldo Rivera offered a barked and incoherent defense, but the network\u2019s reporters were going harder against the official Trump story than usual. Trump\u2019s ire at the network has been building\u2014\u201cThe New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet,\u201d he tweeted on Aug. 28\u2014and he seems to be testing the network\u2019s response to that attempted bullying. If that was his experiment, it\u2019s yielding uneven results. On Thursday, Trump invited Fox White House correspondent John Roberts into the Oval Office \u201cto hit back at Shepard Smith,\u201d according to a White House aide, but it didn\u2019t tilt Roberts\u2019 coverage in the way Trump may have hoped: \u201cBy the time the president tweeted about Alabama at 10:51 am on Sunday, the forecast track had moved well east,\u201d John Roberts emphasized later on a Thursday broadcast. \u201cThere are some \u2026 suggesting that by altering an official forecast map, the president broke a federal law.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why people\u2014even Fox News reporters\u2014are refusing to let #Sharpiegate go. Natural disasters are serious business. And there is nothing partisan about a hurricane map, or about the potential for false alarms and unnecessary panic and misdirected resources. On Sunday, when this debacle began, Alabama meteorologist James Spann quickly replied to Trump\u2019s tweet with \u201cAlabama will not be impacted by Dorian in any way.\u201d Asked whether he\u2019d intended to \u201cbash President Trump,\u201d he replied, \u201cI have zero interest in politics. Dorian will not affect Alabama in any way. That is not a political statement.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s correct. And if #Sharpiegate can be said to serve any non-embarrassing function, it\u2019s as a test of another kind, to see which institutions and people have rotted under the president\u2019s hysterical commands and which ones haven\u2019t. On Thursday, U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Peter Brown issued a statement taking responsibility for the president\u2019s out-of-date information. On Thursday, a source from the White House informed CNN that Trump had personally directed Brown to make this statement. The president was forcing a high-ranking military official to cover for him. On Friday evening, the NOAA released a peculiar, unsigned statement throwing the Alabama NWS under the bus for contradicting the president-who-shall-not-be-contradicted. (The NWS Employees Organization wasn\u2019t having it, and neither were many former NOAA officials, who professed themselves stunned.)\n\nWhat\u2019s noteworthy about all this is not that Trump is forcing the government to write him notes of excuse; that\u2019s old news by now. It\u2019s that his critics have not merely shrugged and gone away, and that even the fa\u00e7ade of his defense has shown cracks. It was a White House aide who revealed the John Roberts visit to the Oval Office, and, according to the Washington Post, it was a White House official who broke with the administration line to admit that the president of the United States had marked up an official NOAA map in order to avoid even a whiff of admitting fault.\n\n\u201cNo one else writes like that on a map with a black Sharpie,\u201d the source said. Trump can sell whatever he wants; he\u2019s seeing what happens when people don\u2019t buy it.", "description": "There may be a limit to bending reality.", "authors": ["Lili Loofbourow"], "top_image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/4fe737a0-b801-46af-a378-286301f8b58f.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1248x832&offset=0x0", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
