We really want to know,' a tearful Grimmer said to the media in 2016.\n\nThree years after his emotional plea, Grimmer fronted Nowra District Court on Thursday for his own crimes.\n\nThe court heard that Grimmer became friends with a 14-year-old girl and her family while staying at a caravan park several years ago.\n\nBut in the 2015 Christmas holidays, the girl noticed Grimmer's demeanour changed, and later told police he started acting 'stupid' with her.\n\nCourt documents revealed Grimmer said to the teenager: 'I wish I was your age,' the Illawarra Star reported.\n\nCheryl's killer has never been convicted of any crime related to her disappearance due to a legal technicality which saw his confession inadmissible in court\n\nGrimmer then assaulted the girl when she came back during the Easter and October holidays the following year.\n\nHe even told the girl not to tell anyone or he would 'get into a lot of trouble.'\n\nDuring one of several incidents, Grimmer took the girl out on his boat before claiming the boat had broken down.\n\nWhile waiting three hours for help out on the water, Grimmer tried to 'force himself' on her while she repeatedly asked him to stop.\n\nMonths later, in the September school holidays, Grimmer and the girl and her family were staying at the holiday park again.\n\nThis time Grimmer indecently assaulted her inside her family's caravan, where he kissed the girl on the lips and touched her breasts under her shirt.\n\nBut the girl revealed the assaults to one of her friends at the holiday park because she 'couldn't handle it anymore'.\n\nDetectives from the child abuse squad arrested Grimmer in 2017 after the assaults were reported to police.\n\nFollowing his eleventh-hour guilty pleas on Thursday, prosecutors applied for Grimmer to be kept behind bars until his sentencing next February.\n\nBut Judge Chris O'Brien refused the request, as Grimmer had not breached any of his bail conditions over the past three years.\n\n'The bail concern here is flight risk now that the presumption of innocence has been lost,' he said.\n\n'He's a person with limited criminal history, does not have any history of violence and has good history of compliance with bail conditions.'\n\nGrimmer will be sentenced next year.", "description": "The older brother of murdered toddler\u00a0Cheryl Grimmer molested a 14-year-old girl in a caravan park after befriending her family.", "authors": ["Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/10/19828294-0-image-a-6_1571303372737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
