But does aligning corporate policy with social issues alienate customers and spell disaster for companies?\n\n\u201cCompanies more and more are expected to express their values through their business decisions \u2014 this is something that customers want, this is something that employees want and I think that\u2019s what Walmart is aiming to do here,\u201d said Aaron Cramer, president and CEO of nonprofit BSR, in an interview with Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move. \u201cWalmart will please some of its customers and alienate some of its customers.\u201d\n\nGun safety in America is a particularly contentious issue and \u201cpolarizing\u201d as it\u2019s directly linked to the Constitution, said Cramer, a consultant who helps companies navigate social issues. The National Rifle Association also has a tremendous amount of power, long dominating the conversation about guns.\n\nBut Cramer notes that not only did Walmart stop selling ammunition used for handguns, military-style weapons, and handguns, it also discouraged people from carrying weapons in its stores and also called on Congress to do something about it. Shortly after Walmart\u2019s announcement, Kroger (KR) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) followed suit asking customers not to bring guns into its stores. And it doesn\u2019t look like it will stop there.\n\nMariachis play during a tribute to the victims of a mass shooting at a Walmart store, in the growing memorial in El Paso, Texas, U.S., August 18, 2019.

More than four in 10 Americans believe leaders should take a stand no matter the issue \u2013 even if it doesn\u2019t matter to their business.\n\nCramer said he thinks we\u2019re seeing a changing mindset in Corporate America and that more companies will make changes based on values. And while shareholders may get hung up on day-to-day stock fluctuations during initial changes, Cramer said looking at the daily value of a stock is short-sighted when determining the overall long-term impact of a shift in business strategy.\n\nWalmart \u201cis acting on the basis of its values that\u2019s something that should provide an abiding value to the company,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nYvette Killian is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nShaq on investing: 'I don\u2019t ever think about making money'\n\nWeWork 'has to give us a valuation that's reasonable': IPO expert\n\n5G will make devices more vulnerable to cyberattacks: Akamai CEO\n\nUS bankruptcy filings rose in July 2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nGold prices can go a 'good deal higher': strategist\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance onTwitter,Facebook,Instagram,Flipboard,SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Walmart and Kroger took bold steps to restrict guns and ammunition.", "authors": ["Yvette Killian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pvUh5I.gfqxIaxlEeMnMGQ--~B/aD0yODQ5O3c9MzYzMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/277677c0-b79b-11e9-bfa2-75be5aaf8f33", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
