Stephen Blais on Saturday.\n\nThe City of Ottawa wants to extend Brian Coburn Boulevard to Renaud Road, a project that would include bus lanes to Blair station, a cycling route across the Greenbelt and improvements to the east-west flow of car traffic.\n\nThe NCC, however, has said that while it supports the overall project, it objects to road alignments that run counter to the Greenbelt Master Plan \u2014 and that includes \"Option 7,\" the route preferred by councillors.\n\nBlais and Innes Coun. Laura Dudas shared their thoughts on the boulevard extension Saturday as they unveiled the new $8.5-million Chapel Hill Park and Ride.\n\nBuilt on the northeast corner of Navan Road and Brian Coburn Boulevard, the park and ride features 263 parking spaces, a cycling shelter and CCTV cameras.\n\nDudas said the park and ride fits with the plan to extend Brian Coburn and is key to linking Orl\u00e9ans residents with the rest of the city.\n\n\"[It's] absolutely an essential piece of our transportation infrastructure, particularly for the growing east end,\" said Dudas.\n\nInnes Coun. Laura Dudas says she wants to meet with new Orl\u00e9ans MP Marie-France Lalonde to talk about ways to convince the NCC to allow an extension of Brian Coburn Boulevard to go forward. (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nNCC seeks 'mutually acceptable solution'\n\nDudas said she wants to meet with newly elected Orl\u00e9ans MP Marie-France Lalonde to ask how the Liberal government can pressure the NCC to support Ottawa's plans for the boulevard.\n\nIn an email to CBC, the NCC said it looks forward to arriving at a \"mutually acceptable solution\" with the City of Ottawa.\n\n\"Through the 2013 Greenbelt master planning process, the NCC and the city agreed on an alignment for the Brian Coburn extension. This was formalized in a letter of understanding that we continue to honour,\" spokesperson Jean wrote Sunday.\n\nWolff said the city recently added other alignment options that could put the nearby Mer Bleue wetland, which is overseen by the commission, at risk.\n\n\"Mer Bleue is home to ecosystems, habitats and several species at risk that would be degraded and, in some cases, devastated by greater human encroachment,\" Wolff said.\n\nThe National Capital Commission says it can't support the preferred extension of Brian Coburn Boulevard, in part because it could compromise the ecologically sensitive Mer Bleue Bog, seen here in 2016. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nNeed to address 'growth': Dudas\n\nDespite the NCC's concerns about Mer Bleue, Dudas said she wants to push ahead with the project.\n\n\"We need to be respectful for the environment, but we also need to make sure we're addressing our growth and looking to the future of our transportation needs,\" she said.\n\nFor Blais, the new park and ride is a good first step but won't solve commuting problems \u2014 particularly for those who want to connect to Ottawa's light rail system.\n\n\"We're opening a brand new, beautiful park and ride this morning,\" he said. \"And every bus coming out of this park and ride is going to be stuck in gridlock traffic as it makes its way to the LRT station.\"", "description": "Now that the federal election is over, Orl\u00e9ans-area\u00a0councillors say it's time for local MPs to pressure the National Capital Commission to support their preferred plan for a local boulevard extension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5279084.1568212953!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/blair-station-ottawa-light-rail-lrt-confederation-line.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
