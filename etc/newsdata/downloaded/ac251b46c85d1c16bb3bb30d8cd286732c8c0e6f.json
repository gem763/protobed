That\u2019s how much he\u2019s enjoying it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been like a kid at Christmas.\u201d\n\nHaving Waugh in the backroom staff, much like Ricky Ponting taking on an assistant coaching role during the World Cup, was a priority for Langer after he faced many testing moments during his first year as coach.\n\n\u201cGuys like Punter (Ponting) and Steve Waugh, not only do they have a great presence in the group, but they are great psychologists,\u201d Langer added.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been in the cauldron before, they\u2019ve seen it all, so to have that those type of guys, we are talking about developing leadership in Australian cricket, to have our guys to learn from people of that calibre is very important short term.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s one-wicket defeat in the third test was a bitter pill to swallow but they would put it behind them, he said.\n\n\u201cI actually felt physically sick after it and then I went back to my room. I wasn\u2019t sure whether to cry my eyes out or smash my hotel room,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone in that change room, probably a lot of Australians felt it, felt completely sick.\n\n\u201cYou never like to let opportunities slip... that\u2019s OK, we\u2019ll make sure we learn from it.\u201d", "description": "Australia have brought back former captain Steve Waugh to help the squad prepare for the final stretch of the Ashes series against England as the tourists look to rebound from the painful third test defeat at Headingley.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425335865&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810NZ"}
