These will be announced in due course.\n\nLGBT charity Stonewall says the current sysyem is costly and inaccessible to many trans people (Picture: Reuters)\n\n\u2018It is vital that the next steps on any potential reform of the Gender Recognition Act are carefully planned, and have the right backing so they can have a positive impact on the trans community in the UK.\u2019\n\nLGBT campaigners have called for the current system to be replaced with a simpler statutory declaration and self-identification.\n\nThey say transgender people currently face a two-tier system.\n\nAccess to single-sex services such as hospital wards are covered under the Equality Act 2010, which says a transgender person\u2019s gender identity should be taken into account when using segregated services, rather than their sex on their birth certificate.\n\nThe current process is also said to cause problems with marriage and death certificates and does not allow for the legal recognition of non-binary people.\n\nExtinction Rebellion launch action plan to blockade London for two weeks\n\nLGBT charity Stonewall director of campaigns, policy and research Laura Russell said: \u2018Currently, trans people must go through a lengthy and demeaning process to have their gender legally recognised.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just distressing, it\u2019s complex, costly and inaccessible to many trans people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Replacing this process with a system of self-determination would be life-changing for many trans people and a crucial step towards ensuring the UK\u2019s gender recognition laws are in line with international best practice.\u2019\n\nDawn Butler, shadow secretary for women and equalities, criticised the Government for the delays in publishing the consultation, originally expected in mid-2019.\n\nBoris Johnson warns French PM Brexit cannot be delayed\n\nMs Butler said: \u2018Boris Johnson\u2019s government have failed to publish the consultation results and are deliberately creating a hostile environment for transgender people.\n\n\u2018We must put a stop to this irresponsible behaviour. Almost half of trans people in Britain have attempted suicide at least once and 84% have thought about it.\n\n\u2018A Labour government will help save lives not ruin them. We will champion rights for LGBT+ communities across the UK and reform the Gender Recognition Act.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
