But nobody in India accepted that as a legitimate approach.\" Armed with evidence that their methods work, she said, it was easier to convince policymakers.\n\nThe economists have also, for example, looked into areas such as class sizes and comparisons between experienced and inexperienced teachers. While the former have obvious benefits, the later compensated for their lack of experience with energy and enthusiasm, she said. The challenge of their work was to prove it.\n\nNot enough women\n\nProf Duflo said: \"If you want to really make a dent in fighting poverty and the problems that go with it you really have to approach it problem-by-problem. Try to put away your preconceptions, and instead try and bring in a scientific and vigorous mindset. The key is experiment.\"\n\nShe said that winning the award was incredibly humbling, and completely unexpected because \"usually a Noble prize goes to a male economist over the age of 60\".\n\nImage copyright AFP/Getty\n\nNot only is the professor just the second women to win the award since it began in 1969, at the age of 46 she is also the youngest winner - male or female.\n\nThe three academics will share prize money of nine million Swedish krona (\u00a3728,000).\n\n\"We will put it [the money] to good use and make the best of it in our work,\" she told the BBC. \"But this is way beyond the money. The influence that this prize will have will give us a megaphone. We will really try to make good use of that megaphone to amplify the work of everyone who works with us.\"\n\nShe also hopes the prize will send a message to other women economists.\n\n\"There just are not enough of us,\" she said. One reason for this is the culture - \"a little bit macho and aggressive,\" she said.\n\nAnother reason is that \"young women are not necessarily inspired by economics as something that could make a difference in the world. They think that if they want to be useful they should become doctors or maybe scientists - but not economists.\"\n\nShe hopes the award will show women that economics \"is not just about wearing ties and suits, and thinking about the macro economy and finance. It can be about changing the world - making the world a better place\".", "description": "The joint winner of the economics prize tells the BBC her work is not rocket science.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14959/production/_109231348_mediaitem109231347.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
