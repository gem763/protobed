But the charge brought on by the digital economy ministry resulted from an interpretation and an effort to link him to the hashtag,' Winyat said.\n\nKarn had joined an activist campaign calling for elections during a period of military rule that ended with a general election this year, Winyat said.\n\nThe arrest comes less than three months after Thailand's new minister of digital economy, Puttipong Punnakanta, vowed to 'purge' social media of royal insults shortly after taking office.\n\nPuttipong also declined to directly link the arrest to the #royalmotorcade hashtag when asked by Reuters on Tuesday, but he said that the suspect's actions were unacceptable.\n\n'We are taking this seriously and this arrest should serve as an example to others, that they should think carefully because it can have criminal consequences,' Puttipong told reporters.\n\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a 2014 military coup, was elected to office in June after his party won elections in a campaign emphasising traditional values including devotion to the monarchy and implying that opposition parties were disloyal.", "description": "Karn Pongpraphapan, 25, was arrested under Thai cybercrime laws Tuesday after he 'stirred hatred' over 'inappropriate hashtags' linked to a royal motorcade which held up Bangkok last week.", "authors": ["Chris Pleasance For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/09/19432278-0-image-a-7_1570522005045.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
