Every time new facts have come out, it has been worse than the last time,\" he said.\n\nThe Snowy 2.0 expansion seeks to stabilise the supply of renewable energy by adding 2000 megawatts of generating capacity and 350,000 megawatt hours, or 175 hours, of storage capacity to the electricity grid.\n\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator found in July that the mega-project could save $86 million a year in fuel costs, and $167 million during a drought, compared with a smaller project.\n\nMr Woodley said he acknowledged that the Snowy 2.0 would have some benefit in augmenting energy supply, but that there had been insufficient scrutiny of alternatives including projects outside Kosciuszko.\n\nSnowy Hydro has maintained that the Snowy 2.0 project is the \"least cost\" option, citing independent analysis in 2018 by consultants Marsden Jacob Associates.\n\nThe NPA has long opposed the pumped hydro project on environmental grounds, claiming its impact will extend beyond the official 1680-hectare \"disturbance footprint\" to 10,000 hectares of Kosciuszko National Park.", "description": "The project could cost five times what the government first promised, according to former EnergyAustralia managing director Ted Woodley.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.831%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_193%2C$y_216/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/718afba05761757393ab63ccac4fe299a6f70091", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
