The document is put out by the IC IG for intelligence workers who need to file urgent complaints that trigger special treatment under the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\nAccording to the GOP and an army of conservative commentators, the old version of the form prohibited workers from submitting urgent complaints based on secondhand information; only misconduct witnessed personally could be reported. That changed in early August, the false claim goes, when ICIG Michael Atkinson snuck through a hasty revision to the complaint form that reversed long-standing policy.\n\n\u201cWhistleblowers were required to provide direct, first-hand knowledge of allegations,\u201d reads a Saturday tweet by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. \u201cBut just days before the Ukraine whistleblower came forward, the IC secretly removed that requirement from the complaint form.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecords show that the intelligence community quietly revised the formal whistleblower complaint form in August 2019,\u201d Rudy Giuliani tweeted on Sunday. \u201cEliminating the requirement to have direct, first-hand knowledge of perceived wrongdoing. Coincidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was on the form literally until apparently very recently,\u201d said Trump\u2019s other lawyer, Jay Sukulow, in an appearance on Hannity. \u201cMonths ago: no first hand information, no report.\u201d\n\n\u201cWOW, they got caught,\u201d tweeted Trump. \u201cEnd the Witch Hunt now!\u201d\n\nThe Atkinson smear comes amid a broad GOP campaign seemingly calculated to discredit the whistleblower report as unreliable, partisan hearsay, despite it having already been corroborated by an IC IG review and confirmed by the White House\u2019s own transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. It began late Friday with a story from the conservative website The Federalist headlined \u201cIntel Community Secretly Gutted Requirement Of First-Hand Whistleblower Knowledge.\u201d The article claimed \u201cthe intelligence community secretly revised the formal whistleblower complaint form in August 2019 to eliminate the requirement of direct, first-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like they are jumping to a lot of conclusions based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the law, the regulatory framework, and the language on one form,\u201d said Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\n\nThe kernel of fact near the center of the conspiracy theory is that there is, indeed, a new version of Form 401 dated August 2019.\n\nA question on the form explicitly anticipates tips based on secondhand information, and asks the whistleblower to check a box: \u201cI have direct and personal knowledge,\u201d or, \u201cI heard about it from others.\u201d The Federalist used a screenshot of that field to illustrate its story.\n\nWhat the article didn\u2019t mention or screenshot is a nearly identical field gracing Form 401 since at least May 2018, making it impossible that it was added as an easement for Trump\u2019s whistleblower. The major difference in the fields is that the old form includes three options instead of two, subdividing secondhand sources into outside source and \u201cother employees.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the form has allowed secondhand reports all along. The requirement for firsthand whistleblowing only is completely made up.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a requirement that a whistleblower have firsthand knowledge of what they\u2019re reporting,\u201d said Irvin McCullough, an investigator at the nonprofit Government Accountability Project (and the son of a former IC IG). \u201cThey need to have a reasonable belief. The firsthand information is usually gathered by the inspector general, as I believe did occur here.\u201d\n\nWhen the IC IG receives an urgent report, it has 14 days to conduct a preliminary review under the law. If that investigation produces enough direct evidence, the IC IG can rule it \u201ccredible,\u201d which triggers the legal requirement to forward the report to the director of central intelligence (DCI), and from there to Congress.\n\nThe Federalist and supporters of the Atkinson smear also point to a two-page information sheet distributed as part of the May 2018 version of the form but not the August 2019 version. It\u2019s unclear when it was dropped, but a paragraph in that now-excised preamble was headed, \u201cFirst-Hand Information Required,\u201d seemingly contradicting the form itself. \u201cIn order to find an \u2018urgent\u2019 concern credible, the IC IG must be in possession of reliable, first-hand information,\u201d the text read in part. \u201cThe IC IG cannot transmit information via the ICWPA based on an employee\u2019s second-hand knowledge of wrongdoing.\u201d\n\nThough the text is confusingly drafted\u2014which may be why the entire preamble was dustbinned\u2014a careful reading shows it\u2019s not erecting a new hurdle for filing a whistleblower complaint, but rather describing the type of evidence the IC IG has to gather to judge the complaint \u201ccredible\u201d at the end of its 14-day investigation.\n\n\"It\u2019s an explanation of the IG\u2019s standard for assessing credibility,\u201d said Sanchez in an interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cThe IG isn\u2019t going to forward it to the DNI if it can\u2019t corroborate secondhand or indirect information. The whistleblower\u2019s job is not to investigate. That is the job of the IG.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Trump\u2019s whistleblower didn\u2019t go through some shady deep state backdoor. He or she followed the process, and government investigators found the firsthand evidence themselves.\n\n\u201cComplainant was not a direct witness to President\u2019s telephone call with the Ukrainian President on July 25, 2019,\u201d the IC IG wrote on August 26. \u201cOther information obtained during the preliminary review, however, supports the Complainant\u2019s allegation that, among other things, during the call the President \u2018sought to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take actions to help the President\u2019s 2020 reelection bid.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Trump has joined an army of conservative commentators in pushing a false story involving an obscure government form, a Trump official, and the whistleblower.", "authors": ["Kevin Poulsen", "Sr. National Security Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569813071/190929-poulsen-whistleblower-tease_qkugoi", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
