Or at least settings that appear otherworldly, thanks to the magic of Photoshop.\n\nThe 22-year-old photographer has gained 100,000 Instagram followers through his dramatic fashion and portrait photography. But he continues to share the raw, unedited beginnings of his art to inspire others to create.\n\nHere are 10 before-and-after photos that show what Hernandez's Instagram photos look like in real life.\n\nHernandez has a talent for taking extraordinary portraits in very ordinary settings.\n\nHe started by taking pictures on his phone in middle school, then bought his first camera in 2014.\n\nHe shares behind-the-scenes photos that show the humble beginnings of his finished work.\n\nThe artsy perfection of Instagram isn't always what it seems.\n\n\"I'm very inspired by fantasy and whimsical images,\" he told Insider.\n\nHe named the \"Harry Potter\" series and the photographer Bella Kotak as influences.\n\nHernandez uses the magic of Lightroom and Photoshop to transform raw photos into vibrant works of art.\n\nHe is a self-taught photographer who honed his skills by watching YouTube videos.\n\n\"Most of how I learned was trial and error,\" he said. \"I basically learned by doing everything wrong and then correcting it.\"\n\nOne of Hernandez's most unconventional settings was a puddle on the street in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nHe was walking down the street with a friend on a rainy day when they came across a large puddle. Hernandez saw a photo opportunity in the splashing water.\n\n\"It created this really cool effect where it looked like the water droplets were frozen around her,\" he said.\n\nIn reality, it was just an ordinary puddle on the side of a busy street.\n\n\"We just used what was around,\" he said.\n\nHe said he feels it's important to show the \"before\" part of his process to prove that you don't need fancy settings or expensive equipment to take good photos.\n\n\"I like showing behind the scenes because people think whenever they see a cool photo that interests them that they must have an extravagant setup, multiple lights, really expensive gear,\" he said. \"But if you see my behind-the-scenes, it's basically just myself with the model in natural light.\"\n\n\"Instagram is very highly edited,\" he said. \"I think it's more relatable to see the behind-the-scenes and realise it's really basic.\"\n\nMore and more influencers are sharing their Instagram outtakes to show that seemingly perfect photos don't reflect reality.\n\nHe hopes to inspire other up-and-coming photographers and creators to express themselves through their art, regardless of budget or level of experience.\n\nHernandez uses his photography projects to express himself.\n\n\"Whatever I'm feeling, if I'm feeling happy or sad, I express that in my photographs,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't have to have all this fancy equipment to start photography,\" he said. \"Just start it.\"", "description": "The photographer Chris Hernandez has a talent for taking extraordinary portraits in very ordinary settings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9332/07969b8cff124cac8275a9db562432b2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
