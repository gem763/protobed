aftermath of the active shooter incident on Las Vegas Boulevard EPA\n\nThe settlement amount announced by lawyers falls in line with a regulatory filing from MGM Resorts, in which it noted that it could face payouts for the same amount.\n\nMGM had initially responded with a robust legal defence to the claims that began to pour in claiming negligence, and sought to block all of the victims from receiving money from the company by arguing that a little-known federal law enacted in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks shielded the company from liability.\n\nThe company then argued that the shooting qualified as an \u201cact of terrorism\u201d under the definitions in that law, and therefore \u2014 because of that, and also because a security firm that had been hired for the event possessed a special designation from the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 the company should not be held liable for damages.\n\nReliance on that law meant that MGM needed to funnel cases into federal court, which ultimately stirred anger when the company began to counter sue victims.\n\nThe shooting on 1 October 2017, left the country reeling from the latest in a string of deadly attacks that have yet to stop. The shooting, as always happens, sparked calls for stricter gun controls in the US, but no major policy changes were enacted.\n\nFiring took place over a span of 10-15 minutes, and the shooter was later found dead on the 32nd floor of the hotel. Alongside him were numerous firearms, and rounds of ammunition.\n\nMGM said in May that a settlement was \u201creasonably possible\u201d, when presented with a deal that is similar to what has now been agreed to.", "description": "Lawyers for the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting say they have reached a deal to settle the lawsuit with MGM Resorts, with an expected payout of up to $800m\u00a0(\u00a3647m).
