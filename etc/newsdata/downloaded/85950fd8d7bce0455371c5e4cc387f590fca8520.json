(Somebody apparently had a lot of free time on their hands.) So how do you suppose the various states did? There was one clear winner in the losers\u2019 column and that was\u2026 (drumroll please) \u2026 California.\n\nYes, the Golden State has the most miserable cities on the list, including ten of the top fifty most miserable. As my mother always said, do your best to excel at something. I suppose this counts. (CBS Sacramento)\n\nCalifornia has the most \u201cmiserable cities\u201d in the country, according to data compiled by Business Insider, and landed 10 cities in the list of 50 most miserable cities in the United States. This region didn\u2019t have any cities ranked in the top 100, and only Yuba City (159st) came in the top 200. Rocklin is considered one of the least miserable cities in the country, coming in at 910 on the list of 1,000. Recently, Money Magazine named Rocklin one of the Top 100 Places to Live.\n\nYou can see the entire list of 1,000 here in spreadsheet form to see where your city ranks.\n\nThey came up with this index by comparing a variety of factors including population shifts, employment rates, median income and average commuting time. In other words, there\u2019s probably some magic mixed in with the science but surely this list has some value anyway. So what can it tell us? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nWhile California nabbed ten of the top fifty spots for being miserable, New Jersey came in a close second with nine of them. (It was basically a tie because another New Jersey city came in at number 51, but if we\u2019re sticking to the rules we shouldn\u2019t count it.) With that sort of a start you might be tempted to think that the blue states are all the most miserable, but not really. There are red and purple states near the top as well. Here are the rest of the states that made the top fifty and how many cities each had.\n\n\u2013 Texas and Florida have five\n\n\u2013 Ohio has four\n\n\u2013 Michigan and Indiana have three\n\n\u2013 Georgia has two\n\n\u2013 Arkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Illinois have one\n\nPart of it is a factor of population, at least to a point. California has the greatest number of miserable cities because California has the most cities. Texas and Florida are big also. But do you notice one state that doesn\u2019t have a single city in the top fifty but has a massive population? New York. I know, right?\n\nIn other words, I\u2019m kind of throwing up my hands here. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any definitive rhyme or reason. It\u2019s mostly just a fun chance to dunk on California, I suppose. Look over the list and see if you can make heads or tails of it.", "description": "I bet you already know", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Jeopardy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
