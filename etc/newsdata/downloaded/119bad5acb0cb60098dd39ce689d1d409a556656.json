The agency said the 30-year-old told deputies he was armed and made motions like he was drawing a weapon when he was shot outside his father\u2019s home in Hope Ranch, a suburb of luxury homes outside Santa Barbara.\n\nThree of the deputies who fired on Cameron Ely have more than 12 years of experience apiece; the other deputy has two years of law enforcement experience.\n\nThe younger Ely is suspected of stabbing his mother, Valerie Lundeen Ely, multiple times and killing her. No motive for the slaying has been released.\n\nRon Ely, 81, played the title character on the NBC series \u201cTarzan,\u201d which ran from 1966 to 1968.\n\nHe was host of the Miss America pageant in 1980 and 1981 and later married Valerie, a former Miss Florida.
