I regret that,\" Tytti Tuppurainen, Finland's EU affairs minister, said at the end of a ministerial meeting in Luxembourg, adding that the issue will now be discussed at a meeting of EU leaders this week.\n\n\u201cThe huge majority\" of member states supported \"opening the access negotiations for both countries,\u201d Tuppurainen said, adding that she is confident EU leaders would make a positive decision.\n\nThe EU's enlargement commissioner, Johannes Hahn, said he doesn't want to blame anybody for the failure but stressed several times that it \u201cwas not a moment of glory for Europe,\u201d adding that any further postponement could damage EU credibility in the Balkans. Hahn also said a positive decision at the EU leaders' summit would simply mean a green light to opening accession negotiations, which take years.\n\nThe Commission has twice recommended opening talks with the two Balkan countries. For supporters of enlargement, it's a process that could provide stability in the region while keeping at bay the influence of Russia, China and Turkey.\n\nYet although the majority of EU countries \u2014 including Germany and Italy \u2014 are in favor of enlargement, there are deep divisions. France opposes opening talks with the two countries until the entire accession process is reformed, while a group of countries led by the Netherlands is only in favor of talks with North Macedonia. \u201cFrance was the only country opposing ... North Macedonia,\u201d a diplomat said. Another diplomat accused Paris of \u201cacting already as if we were in a post-Brexit world where they think they can call all the shots.\u201d\n\nAfter trying to reach a deal, the Finnish presidency of the Council of the EU presented a document in the meeting, seen by POLITICO, saying ministers will \u201crevert to the issue after the European Council.\u201d\n\nYet according to two diplomats, Paris rejected this text, which will now be forwarded to Council President Donald Tusk. According to some diplomats, France will only budge when it's clear what it can get in exchange on other dossiers.\n\n\u201cWe are very disappointed that apparently we won't be able to deliver on what we have promised several times already, which is the start of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania,\u201d German EU Minister Michael Roth told reporters on his way in to the meeting.\n\nOne attempt to compromise brokered by the Finns, a proposal to \"de-couple\" the two Balkan states from each other in the process, failed to find what diplomats call \"a landing zone.\"\n\nTensions have been rising since Friday when, at a meeting of EU ambassadors, France made clear its intentions.\n\nAn Elys\u00e9e official said they don't want to send \"a bad signal to the region\u201d but \u201cwe need to have more reforms by these two countries.\u201d\n\nWhat Paris wants is to review \u201cthe [enlargement] process itself ... before opening it up, because the negotiation process is very legal and bureaucratic, we open and close chapters one by one, without real visibility,\u201d the official added.\n\nOthers take a different view. North Macedonia and Albania \u201chave provided evidence during the migration crisis and other issues [that] they are part of this family and again they have fulfilled all conditions. This is why we should give the green light today,\u201d Austrian EU Minister Alexander Schallenberg told reporters.\n\nSchallenberg told his fellow ministers that the EU shouldn't take an \u201caccounting\u201d approach to enlargement as otherwise many EU countries would have never managed to join the bloc. On the opposite side of the argument, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said the fight against corruption in Albania must be stepped up, two diplomats said.\n\nMany EU diplomats are angry that the Balkan countries aren't being rewarded for their hard work of late. North Macedonia for example, was instrumental in stemming the flow of asylum seekers crossing the Balkans during the 2015 migration crisis and it managed to reach a deal with Greece on changing its name.\n\nRym Momtaz contributed reporting.", "description": "France opposes opening of talks until the entire accession process is revamped.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Paul Dallison", "Krithika Varagur"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1174730124-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
