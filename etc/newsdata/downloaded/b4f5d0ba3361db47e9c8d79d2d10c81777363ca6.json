The 49ers\u2019 pass rush is also formidable. As a team, the 49ers are averaging 13 total pressures (sacks, hits and hurries) per game. Nick Bosa, the NFC Defensive Player of the Week, has been credited with 26 total pressures through four games, giving him the sixth-highest pressure rate (18 percent) among defensive lineman this season, per Sports Info Solutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat defense helps explain why we are picking the 49ers to cover this week as 3-point underdogs against the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nUnusual and perhaps unfair: The 49ers line Nick Bosa and Dee Ford up on the same side. That allows Bosa to work against a guard, whom he tramples, creating a traffic jam that allows Ford to sprint right by. That's one cohesive pass rush. pic.twitter.com/3lRCgPDbeb \u2014 David Lombardi (@LombardiHimself) October 9, 2019\n\nHere is how we expect the Week 6 games to shake out, starting with two prime picks against the consensus point spreads (as of Thursday morning) from multiple sports books in Las Vegas.\n\nDallas Cowboys (-7) at New York Jets\n\nPick: Dallas Cowboys -7\n\nThe Jets are scoring a mere 0.5 points per drive this season, the lowest rate of any team through five weeks since 2002, when the league expanded to 32 teams. New York has also been forced to go three-and-out half the time.\n\nDallas, meanwhile, is scoring 2.5 points per drive (third most) and its quarterback, Dak Prescott, is the most-valuable passer of 2019 per ESPN\u2019s Total Quarterback Rating. Ignore the Cowboys\u2019 loss to the Packers, and count on them this week.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers at Los Angeles Rams (-3)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPick: San Francisco 49ers +3\n\nThe 49ers also have the league\u2019s best red-zone defense this season (20 percent) and are the only team to not allow a rushing touchdown in 2019. As noted above, Pro Football Focus rates their pass rush as the fourth best this year and their pass coverage unit as the second best, which has helped them hold opposing quarterbacks to a 62.8 passer rating-against. The league average is 92.6.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s going to be hard for Rams quarterback Jared Goff, a below-average performer this season (83.0 passer rating, 23rd highest QBR), to get his offense going.\n\n***\n\nThe two games above represent our best plays of the week because our analysis shows the point spreads are the most divergent from what we expect to happen once the teams take the field. Below are picks for the other games on this week\u2019s schedule. However, trying to pick every single NFL game is something of a fool\u2019s errand. The house wins so often partly because bettors try to make too many plays when the odds aren\u2019t in their favor. Keep that in mind when evaluating the remaining games from the Week 6 slate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew York Giants at New England Patriots (-17)\n\nPick: New England Patriots -17\n\nCarolina Panthers (-2\u00bd) at Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nPick: Carolina Panthers -2\u00bd\n\nSeattle Seahawks (-1\u00bd) at Cleveland Browns\n\nPick: Seattle Seahawks -1\u00bd\n\nNew Orleans Saints at Jacksonville Jaguars (-1)\n\nPick: Jacksonville Jaguars -1\n\nHouston Texans at Kansas City Chiefs (-4\u00bd)\n\nPick: Kansas City Chiefs -4\u00bd\n\nWashington Redskins (-3\u00bd) at Miami Dolphins\n\nPick: Washington Redskins -3\u00bd\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles at Minnesota Vikings (-3)\n\nPick: Philadelphia Eagles +3\n\nCincinnati Bengals at Baltimore Ravens (-11\u00bd)\n\nPick: Cincinnati Bengals +11\u00bd\n\nAtlanta Falcons (-2\u00bd) at Arizona Cardinals\n\nPick: Atlanta Falcons -2\u00bd\n\nTennessee Titans at Denver Broncos (-2\u00bd)\n\nAD\n\nPick: Denver Broncos -2\u00bd\n\nPittsburgh Steelers at Los Angeles Chargers (-7)\n\nPick: Los Angeles Chargers -7\n\nDetroit Lions at Green Bay Packers (-4)\n\nAD\n\nPick: Detroit Lions +4\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "San Francisco's Nick Bosa, the NFC Defensive Player of the Week, has been a force on the field this season, and should help the Niners cover.", "authors": ["Neil Greenberg", "Reporter Analyzing Advanced Sports Statistics For The Washington Post"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VMRZbzcO2wrN1beA1GXnk6bM0hQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4SLUS6XJPQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
