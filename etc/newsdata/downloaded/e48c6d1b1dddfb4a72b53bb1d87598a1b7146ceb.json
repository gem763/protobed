The victims had been standing in an apartment building courtyard in the Columbia Heights neighborhood when they were shot, Metropolitan Police commander Stuart Emerman said.\n\nTwo suspects were seen in a Nissan sedan and used an \u201cAK style rifle,\u201d police said in statement.\n\n\u201cDetectives are interviewing witnesses and looking for camera footage,\u201d Emerman said.\n\nAbout half an hour after the first incident, three people were shot in the northeastern part of the city, leaving one dead, according to NBC\u2019s Washington affiliate. There was no initial indication the two shootings were linked, NBC reported, citing police.\n\nDC Police on Twitter confirmed the second shooting in the 1400 block of Rhode Island Avenue just south of the Brookland neighborhood but gave no other details.\n\nABC affiliate WJLA-TV showed ambulances carrying victims from the scene of the first shooting.\n\nGun violence has been a regular feature of American life, but a spate of recent mass shootings in Texas, Ohio and other states have renewed debate over the nation\u2019s gun laws and spurred calls for action.\n\nMany Republicans and the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, oppose further restrictions on gun ownership. Republican Vice President Mike Pence has decried the gun-control stance and accused the Democrats as having a \u201cradical agenda.\u201d\n\nRepublican President Donald Trump, in an interview with Fox News that aired on Thursday, said he was looking for compromise steps that both Democrats and Republicans could support on gun control, but has given no details on what action he may push.\n\nHouse Democrats have passed several gun initiatives, including expanded background checks, but the Republican-led Senate has not taken up the legislation.\n\nRescue vehicles are seen following a shooting in Washington, D.C., U.S. September 19, 2019, in this picture obtained from social media.
