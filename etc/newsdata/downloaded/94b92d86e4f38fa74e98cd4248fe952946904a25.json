Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nResearch has accused social media \u2014 and Instagram and Facebook, in particular \u2014 of distorting how young people see themselves. A 2018 report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that social media platforms are fueling a rise in mental health disorders and body dysmorphic disorder, which has led to some users seeking out plastic surgery procedures to meet unrealistic beauty standards. A review of 20 studies on social media and self esteem also associated social media use with body image issues and eating disorders. And Instagram in particular has been named the worst social media platform for the mental health of young people.\n\n\u201cThe Good Place\u201d star Jamil, who founded the i_weigh body positive platform, wrote on her own Instagram page on Wednesday \u201cThis is an extraordinary win that makes a big difference. Influencers have to be more responsible.\u201d\n\nShe also told Elle UK that society has \u201chyper-normalized flogging nonsense to young impressionable people. These people are selling hair growth gummies but wearing extensions, or photoshopping themselves to look slimmer and selling a weight loss shake.\u201d\n\nShe added that, \u201cFor huge corporations \u2014 who are the main access points for these companies to sell their products to young people over the internet \u2014 to say they don\u2019t condone this sends out a huge ripple across the Earth. It says that if giant corporations are willing to take a stand against this, then it must be really serious.\u201d\n\nJamil has a history of calling out celebrities and influencers who promote diet products, such as when she said Kim Kardashian is \u201ca terrible and toxic influence on young girls\u201d last year, after Kardashian hawked Flat Tummy Co\u2019s appetite-suppressing lollipops on her Instagram. (Kardashian later took down the post.)\n\nIt\u2019s the latest hit against influencers, who can earn big bucks by pushing all manner of branded products to their thousands of followers. Indeed, Kylie Jenner can command $1.27 million per sponsored post, according to HopperHq.com\u2019s Instagram Rich List. Ariana Grande can score $966,000 per post. Sister Kim Kardashian can collect $910,000.\n\nRelated: Kylie Jenner can make more money in one Instagram post than many people earn in a lifetime\n\nInstagram has been test-driving removing the \u201clikes\u201d feature in some markets in seven countries, including Australia, Canada and Japan, and hiding the number of \u201clikes\u201d that followers can see on a post (the original poster will see be able to see them, however) to rein in the keeping-up-with-the-Joneses (or, Kardashians) mentality that many users crave to get as much online vindication as possible. So rather than focusing on how many \u201clikes\u201d they get, users can simply \u2026 look at the pictures. And that wrecks the business model for influencers who measure their influence by the number of \u201clikes\u201d and followers that they get.\n\nInstagram has also been removing \u201cflipped accounts,\u201d or those that have been bought and sold, which has hit the pockets of people like this 23-year-old who makes flipping Insta pages his full-time career.\n\nRelated: This 23-year-old has made $120,000 buying and selling Instagram accounts", "description": "Users under 18 are being blocked from seeing some diet and cosmetic surgery posts.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR641_teenso_ZG_20190919120124.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
