Good luck if you try that!\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby have made much of their campaign to rid the game of high hits and the fact that the match officials did not penalise Hodge even after reference to the TV pictures will be an embarrassment for them.\n\nWithout specifically mentioning the Hodge incident but perhaps to clear the ground for it, World Rugby issued a statement on Tuesday admitting the officiating over the opening weekend had not been up to scratch.\n\nThere might be more embarrasment on the way for World Rugby after Samoans Rey Lee-lo and Motu Matu\u2019u were cited for dangerous high tackles on Wednesday after only being shown yellow cards in their match against Russia.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a benchmark that I think they\u2019ll look back and regret when the biggest talking point out of this World Cup is refereeing decisions and sanctions,\u201d former Wallabies winger Drew Mitchell said of World Rugby on Fox Sports TV.\n\nHodge can appeal the decision within 48 hours. Rugby Australia have yet to comment on the punishment.\n\nReuters\n\nRead more\n\nHodge out of World Cup pool stage after ban for high tackle\n\nWhat more can World Rugby do if officials fail to apply the rules?\n\nHodge tackle throws World Rugby \u2018crackdown\u2019 back into spotlight", "description": "Australia\u2019s media has reacted with fury to the decision to ban Wallabies winger Reece Hodge for three World Cup matches for a dangerous tackle with Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph describing it as \u201cfarcical\u201d.Hodge caught Fijian flanker Peceli Yato in the head with a tackle in the 26th minute of the Pool D opener", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gjxf8wyZ6kGeHdRSvFty_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEwNTI7aD03OTA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rDNvYu6qnRvRVCt2WdP6dg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/490ddd0dffa5146ecbe204d521924c6a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
