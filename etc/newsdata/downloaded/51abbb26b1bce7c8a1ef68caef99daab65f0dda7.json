A lower court judge earlier this month rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s claim, which has not previously been tested in the courts.\n\nCarey Dunne, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s general counsel, cited the president\u2019s famous claim that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing political support.\n\nMr. Dunne asked what would happen in that extreme scenario? \u201cWould we have to wait for an impeachment proceeding to be initiated?\u201d he said.\n\nLater, Judge Denny Chin posed the Fifth Avenue hypothetical to William S. Consovoy, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, and asked for his view.\n\n\u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate? They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d Judge Chin asked, adding: \u201cNothing could be done? That\u2019s your position?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is correct. That is correct,\u201d Mr. Consovoy said.\n\nThe panel did not immediately indicate when it would issue a ruling, but Judge Robert A. Katzmann, the appeals court\u2019s chief judge, signaled that he and the other judges understood both the gravity of the matter and that they were unlikely to have the final word.\n\n\u201cThis case seems bound for the Supreme Court,\u201d Judge Katzmann said early in the arguments, adding later, as the hearing wrapped up, \u201cWe have the feeling you may be seeing each other again in Washington.\u201d\n\nA deal struck with the district attorney\u2019s office will allow the president time to seek a speedy review of the appellate ruling in the Supreme Court on the condition that he ask that the court hear the case in its current term, which ends in June.\n\nThe district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat, has agreed not to seek enforcement of the subpoena until the Supreme Court either refuses to hear Mr. Trump\u2019s case or issues an opinion, whichever comes first. Mr. Vance was present in the spectator section of the courtroom as the arguments took place.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan typically decides cases through three-judge panels. The panel members who heard the subpoena dispute were Judge Katzmann, Judge Chin and Judge Christopher F. Droney.\n\nJudge Katzmann was appointed to the appeals court by President Bill Clinton. Judges Chin and Droney were appointed by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe appeal by Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers came after a lower court judge ruled on Oct. 7 that the president\u2019s argument that he could not be investigated by a local prosecutor was \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d\n\nMr. Vance\u2019s office in late August subpoenaed Mr. Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his personal and corporate tax returns dating to 2011.\n\nThe district attorney had been investigating whether any New York State laws were broken when Mr. Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, reimbursed Michael D. Cohen, the president\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, for payments he made to the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who had said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nMr. Trump went into federal court last month, trying to block the district attorney\u2019s subpoena. The president argued that the Constitution prevented a sitting president from being \u201cinvestigated, indicted or otherwise subjected to criminal process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe subpoena is a bad faith effort to harass the president by obtaining and exposing his confidential financial information, not a legitimate attempt to enforce New York law,\u201d the president\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nDownload the Microsoft News app to get breaking news, updates and analysis on your Android or iPhone device.\n\nAfter Judge Victor Marrero of United States District Court in Manhattan, in a 75-page ruling, rejected Mr. Trump\u2019s broad argument, the president\u2019s lawyers appealed to the Second Circuit.\n\n\n\nThey contended that Mr. Trump\u2019s claim of absolute immunity was meritorious; they said the framers of the Constitution, recognizing the need for a strong chief executive, created a process \u2014 impeachment \u2014 for investigating and removing a president in a manner that would \u201cembody the will of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lone county prosecutor cannot circumvent this arrangement,\u201d they said.\n\nThe Justice Department also weighed in, telling the appeals panel that the case raised \u201csignificant constitutional issues.\u201d\n\nThe government is not a party to the case, but has the right to provide its views.\n\nThe Justice Department, led by William P. Barr, asked that the court stop the release of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax returns and reiterated its longstanding position that a sitting president may not be charged or prosecuted.\n\nBut the department appeared to leave open the door for Mr. Trump to be investigated by Mr. Vance\u2019s office.\n\nThe department argued that a local prosecutor had to meet a high legal bar before investigating a sitting president, and that Mr. Vance should not be able to obtain the president\u2019s personal records \u201cunless and until \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 the district attorney is able to make the required showing of particularized need.\u201d\n\nThe department said the district attorney would have to show that the records it was seeking from Mr. Trump were central to the grand jury investigation, were not available elsewhere and were needed immediately, as opposed to after Mr. Trump leaves office.\n\nMr. Vance\u2019s office, citing Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments in the case, told the appeals court in a brief that Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201ccore position on every one of these matters is that the United States presidency places him beyond the reach of the law.\u201d", "description": "Trump Lawyer Says Even if He Shot Someone on Fifth Ave., He Can\u2019t be Prosecuted", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAJe3L2.img?h=169&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=841&y=234", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
