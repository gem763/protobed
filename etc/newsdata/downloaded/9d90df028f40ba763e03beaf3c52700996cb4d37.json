And now that their respective teams have had ample time to build rosters around them, these unicorns could define the 2019-20 season.\n\nThe unicorns:\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo\n\nAnthony Davis\n\nNikola Jokic\n\nJoel Embiid\n\nKristaps Porzingis\n\nKarl Anthony-Towns\n\nBen Simmons\n\nBy the numbers: In 2015-16, there were zero players 6-feet-10-inches or taller who were used as the ball handler in the pick-and-roll at least 200 times. By 2017-18, there were 3 (Antetokounmpo, Simmons, Kevin Durant).\n\nHeck, Blake Griffin was used in 300 such possessions last year \u2014 proof that this paradigm shift extends beyond even the unicorns, themselves (or perhaps Griffin should also be considered one now that he's transformed his game).\n\nJokic has recorded triple-doubles at a faster rate than any center in history, and after averaging 7.3 assists per game last season, he's closing in on Wilt Chamberlain's record for highest per-game average by a center (8.6).\n\nTowns has been used as a primary ball handler and playmaker in summer workouts, per The Athletic, and is poised to become more Jokic-like now that Tom Thibodeau and his archaic philosophies are long gone.\n\nThe big picture: The rise of the unicorn is about far more than the talents of those individuals. Their versatility has changed the rules of the game, allowing teams to play \"small-ball\" with a slew of big men.\n\nJudging by size, we'll see lineups this season that look like they belong in the 1990s, when basketball was dominated by physical, low-post play.\n\nBut judging by skill, the comparison falls flat. These 7-footers can shoot. They can dribble. They're gazelles. Heck, they're Monstars.\n\nPrime examples: The Sixers will have 3 players 6-feet-10-inches or taller in their starting lineup (Simmons, Embiid, Al Horford), while the Lakers have discussed a \"jumbo lineup\" featuring LeBron James at the 2, Davis at the 3, JaVale McGee at the 4 and Dwight Howard at the 5.\n\nThe bottom line: The \"Unicorn Era\" has been defined by the players listed above, but it's ultimately a reimagining of what's possible for all players (and not just in the NBA) \u2014 a renewed sense of creativity in a sport that suddenly feels boundless.", "description": "They're transforming the sport with their unique blend of size, skill and athleticism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/X7MURhpjcbBfeQCmGOgNgPeT8vA=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571747793258.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
