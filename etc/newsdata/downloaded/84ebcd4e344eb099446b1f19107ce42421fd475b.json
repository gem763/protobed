Previously, the Manchester United manager had met each lifeless performance and disappointing result on this run of form with an unreasonably optimistic outlook.\n\nHe declared himself \u201cpleased\u201d with the goalless draw in Den Haag last Thursday, in which United failed to register a shot on target. There were \u201clessons to learn\u201d from the stalemate with third-tier Rochdale at Old Trafford. He was \u201cvery positive\u201d despite the defeat at West Ham. In public, at least.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd yet on Sunday, even he could find little to smile about. After losing 1-0 at second-bottom Newcastle United, thereby failing to win an 11th straight away game and extending the club\u2019s worst start to a season in 30 years, he could not pretend there was any silver lining.\n\n\u201c[The defeat is] very symptomatic of where we are at the moment,\u201d Solskjaer said, despite for weeks speaking of improvements the rest of us must have missed. To be fair, he then hit the nail on the head. \u201cWe don't create enough chances to deserve to win a game of football. That's the short version.\u201d\n\nThere was more. \u201cFirst half, I couldn't see that one coming before the game. It was such a disappointing performance first half,\u201d Solskjaer added. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t control it, it was like a hot potato, bouncing off our feet. The second half was better, but you could still see a couple of counter-attacks coming before the goal.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, when there is a decision to be made they don't do it instinctively. That affects everyone.\u201d This was a much more contrite version of Solskjaer than we have witnessed recently. He even apologised to fans and suggested a top-six finish would be difficult to achieve.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe United manager has rarely been so critical of his players\u2019 performances and so downcast on the team\u2019s prospects. This is not pessimism, though. It is a healthy dose of realism, as well as a long-awaited recognition that results simply have not been good enough.\n\nThe only comparable press conference Solskjaer has given during his time at United came back in April, after a woeful 4-0 reverse at Goodison Park, when he sent a warning to some of those who had turned out for United that day. \u201cI am going to be successful here,\u201d he promised. \u201cThere are players there who won\u2019t be part of that successful team.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he made a reference to that day in the wake of the Newcastle defeat. \u201cThis is not a similar situation to when I was sat here after Everton last year, when I felt people had given up and they don\u2019t give what they have for the shirt,\u201d he insisted. \u201cThese boys give everything they\u2019ve got for the shirt.\u201d\n\nBut only three members of that 18-man squad at Goodison Park \u2013 Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Chris Smalling \u2013 have left the club, and only Lukaku has left permanently. Ten of the 18 were still in Solskjaer\u2019s match day squad on Sunday. The remaining five are still at the club, and most of them would have featured at St James\u2019 Park if not for injury.\n\nPerhaps Lukaku, Sanchez and Smalling were the only ones Solskjaer had an issue with back in April. Coming into the new campaign, perhaps he felt that the problems experienced at the tail end of last season were in the past. Perhaps, but it seems more likely that few players Solskjaer targeted that day are still at the club.\n\nUnited look just as bad now as they did back in April, if not worse. The job is arguably the most challenging in elite world football. Better-qualified managers would struggle and fail. Some already have. Admitting you have a problem is the first step, at least, and Solskjaer finally did that on Sunday. Whether he has the ability to fix it is another question entirely.\n\nRead more\n\nSolskjaer apologises to United supporters after latest abysmal display\n\nLongstaff's debut winner leaves Man United unravelling\n\nDe Gea: United in \u2018worst\u2019 place after \u2018unacceptable\u2019 Newcastle loss", "description": "The good news is that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer now accepts there is a problem.
