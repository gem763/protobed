In little more than a month, virtually every other foreign policy initiative the Trump administration has pursued has imploded \u2014 thanks mostly to the president\u2019s increasingly unhinged behavior.\n\nThe unraveling started on Sept. 7, when Trump abruptly announced that he had canceled a previously undisclosed summit with the Afghan Taliban due to be held the next day at Camp David, and shelved a draft peace deal that a State Department special envoy had spent a year negotiating. The immediate result was a spike in violence in Afghanistan \u2014 and at least the temporary shelving of Trump\u2019s ambition to pull U.S. troops out of the country before the 2020 election.\n\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\nA week later, Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran came undone. Following an Iranian-sponsored attack on a Saudi oil complex, Trump ruled out a military response; instead, he told French President Emmanuel Macron that he was open to a plan to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the United Nations and lift sanctions on his government in return for negotiations. The gambit failed: Rouhani left Trump waiting on a phone line. But Saudi Arabia got the message: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has asked Iraq and Pakistan to broker a de-escalation with Tehran.\n\nJust two weeks after the Iran debacle, Trump saw his nuclear negotiations with North Korea crumble \u2014 again. At a meeting in Stockholm, Kim Jong Un\u2019s delegation rejected a U.S. proposal for an incremental deal \u2014 a far cry from the total disarmament Trump once sought \u2014 and walked away, refusing to agree to a date for future talks. Trump\u2019s hopes for a Nobel Prize-securing breakthrough in 2020 now look vanishingly small.\n\nAll that led up to Trump\u2019s Oct. 6 phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in which he blindsided the Pentagon by facilitating a Turkish invasion of northern Syria. The most likely result, in addition to the betrayal of the Kurdish allies who fought with American troops for the past four years, will be the revival of the Islamic State, whose destruction was Trump\u2019s most tangible foreign policy accomplishment.\n\nIs there anything left to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda? Not really. The attempt to oust the socialist government of Venezuela flopped back in April. The plan for the \u201cultimate deal\u201d between Israelis and Palestinians has never been released, and Trump\u2019s point man on that project, Jason Greenblatt, announced his departure last month.\n\nTrue, Trump is still pressing his trade war with China and announced a partial deal on Friday. But most tariffs remain in place and the easy victory over Beijing he once promised is nowhere in sight.\n\nThis is the place in the column where I am supposed to identify the common thread that explains all these disasters. Only there isn\u2019t one, other than Trump\u2019s mounting erraticism. His explanation for pulling the plug on the U.S. mission in Syria \u2014 where just 1,000 U.S. troops were ensuring that Islamic State stayed down, while thwarting Russian and Iranian ambitions \u2014 is that he was determined to stop \u201cendless wars.\u201d But the deal he nixed in Afghanistan would have brought far more American soldiers home \u2014 5,000 right away, and up to 15,000 by Election Day. The only explanation Trump offered for squelching it was that the insurgents had staged an attack that killed an American soldier \u2014 a strange reason for not ending an 18-year-old war.\n\nTrump\u2019s reversal on Iran was even more startling. For two years he had ramped up pressure on Tehran: While his top aides talked about regime change, Trump threatened \u201cthe official end of Iran\u201d if it mounted a military challenge. Yet when the Iranians started striking targets in the Persian Gulf, the only casualty of Trump\u2019s response was his hawkish national security adviser, John Bolton, who had pushed him toward war. Now he appears desperate in his eagerness to open negotiations.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s reason for relief about some of Trump\u2019s broken policies. The confrontation with Iran was unnecessary, and war in the Persian Gulf would be a catastrophe. The Taliban deal would have betrayed an Afghan government in which the United States has invested two decades and hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nBut the carnage of Trump\u2019s foreign policy likely isn\u2019t over yet. Kim Jong Un has set a year-end deadline for getting what he wants from Trump \u2014 an end to sanctions \u2014 after which North Korea could return to testing nuclear warheads or intercontinental missiles. Iran may carry out further strikes in the Persian Gulf to try to force Trump to lift sanctions. And the Islamic State will probably regain its footing in eastern Syria. All that may not be as threatening to Trump as an impeachment vote. But it could do a lot of damage to U.S. national interests.\n\nRead more from Jackson Diehl\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s Syria decision reflects his stunning ignorance of the situation\n\nDavid Ignatius: Trump has a chance to reset the table in Afghanistan\n\nJackson Diehl: How the diplomatic pros lost Ukraine to Trump\n\nHenry Olsen: Trump\u2019s decision to cancel peace talks with the Taliban could be a huge blunder\n\nFahrettin Altun: The world must support Turkey\u2019s plan for northeastern Syria", "description": "However, there\u2019s cause for relief about some of the president\u2019s many broken policies and promises.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAIJ9V9.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1963&y=1206", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
