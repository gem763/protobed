Dr. Stephen Campbell, Chief Technology Officer at Nano One Materials Corp., is pleased to announce the issuance of US Patent No. 10,446,835 which augments the intellectual property estate of the Nano OneTM proprietary process, cathode materials and improved batteries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis patent complements those recently issued across the globe and protects those physical attributes Nano One's proprietary cathode materials most closely associated with battery performance,\u201d said Dr. Campbell. \u201cThe surface properties of single crystal cathode materials contribute to critical battery properties such as shorter charge time, longer battery life, and increased battery capacity. Nano One's innovative control of these surface properties is important for our strategic partners.\u201d\n\nNano One's technology produces discrete single crystal particles rather than larger clusters and this resists cracking and degradation from repeated charging. This improves the durability of cathode materials and could enable electric vehicle manufacturers to significantly increase the lifespan and driving range of their batteries. Nano One is making these patented materials using innovative manufacturing technologies with fewer steps, simpler feedstocks and integrated coatings. These technologies are protected by patents in the US, Canada, Taiwan, China, Japan and Korea.\n\nThese innovations and advantages are explained in an informative 90 second animation provided at http://nanoone.ca/nmcinnovationsanimated/\n\n\u201cNano One's patent estate is multifaceted,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Guy, Nano One Director and Patent Agent, \u201cwith patents covering the proprietary process, as well as the improved nano crystalline cathode materials made using the process. Of particular importance to our strategic partners are patents focused on batteries having improved properties achieved through the use of these proprietary materials.\u201d\n\nNano One Materials Corp.\n\nDan Blondal, CEO\n\nFor information with respect to Nano One or the contents of this news release, please contact John Lando (President) at (604) 420-2041 or visit the website at www.nanoone.ca .\n\nAbout Nano One\n\nNano One Materials Corp has developed patented technology for the low-cost production of high performance lithium ion battery cathode materials used in electric vehicles, energy storage and consumer electronics. The processing technology enables lower cost feedstocks, simplifies production and advances performance for a wide range of cathode materials. Nano One has built a demonstration pilot plant and is partnering with global leaders in the lithium ion battery supply chain, including Pulead, Volkswagen and Saint-Gobain to advance its lithium iron phosphate battery (LFP), lithium nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) and lithium manganese nickel (LMN) cathode technologies for large growth opportunities in e-mobility and renewable energy storage applications.\n\nNano One\u2019s pilot and partnership activities are being funded with the assistance and support of the Government of Canada through Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) and the Automotive Supplier Innovation Program (ASIP) a program of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada ISED). Nano One also receives financial support from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP). Nano One\u2019s mission is to establish its patented technology as a leading platform for the global production of a new generation of battery materials. www.nanoone.ca\n\nCertain information contained herein may constitute \u201cforward-looking information\u201d under Canadian securities legislation.
