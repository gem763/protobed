Sinking their money into these funds are some of the country\u2019s richest families.\n\nAs well as Regal, the funds include Rich Lister Alex Waislitz\u2019s Thorney Investments, another investor in Credible and also an early investor in buy now, pay later juggernaut Afterpay where the surging share price has propelled chief executive Nick Molnar into 66th spot on the 2019 Young Rich List.\n\nTDM Growth Partners is a Sydney-based player that\u2019s backed terminals provider Tyro Payments, tipped to float this year worth more than $1 billion, as well as retailer Baby Bunting, employee feedback system Culture Amp and others.\n\nAnd just down the road in Sydney\u2019s prestigious Macquarie Street is Alium Capital Management, which has invested in 45 businesses, including Koala Mattress, Nitro and Spriggy.\n\nThese funds call themselves private growth capital, or sometimes \u201ccrossover funds\u201d, and are staking out a sweet spot. They focus on companies that have proved they can generate meaningful revenue, and that need more capital to get to a public float.\n\nThanks to his Koala Mattress investment, Australian cricketer Steve Smith is in 95th place on the Young Rich List. Getty\n\nAs a result, they\u2019re playing on a different field from both traditional venture capital, which invests smaller licks of money at an earlier stage, as well as private equity, which looks for more established businesses and swallows them whole.\n\nOutsiders call it souped-up venture capital. But really, this new patch of finance is so hot that the boundaries as to who does what are already getting blurry.\n\nLow yields and interest rates are turbo-charging the space. Right now, this is the segment of the market where the action is and where the fast money is playing. Often, the funds get on board at the last stop, pre-IPO round, where funds buy into companies with a planned exit in 12 months or so, usually via a sharemarket float.\n\nThe key skills? Sifting through dozens and dozens of founder-led private businesses, sorting the wheat from the chaff; avoiding the dogs and looking for the founders who really have what it takes to scale up and make it big.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese funds are the ones \u2013 to borrow the words of Rajeev Gupta, the co-founder of Alium Capital \u2013 that want founders to dream more, take on a little bit more risk. And hopefully, they\u2019ll all get richer along the way.\n\nThe irony of the Financial Review Young Rich List \u2013 and rankling irritation for many who find themselves on it \u2013 is that very often, these business builders aren\u2019t really rich at all. These are people who have created fast-growing, successful companies, often at great personal cost. But their wealth is tied up in the valuation of a business that is tricky to sell.\n\nFounders don\u2019t like to sell shares in their baby, especially when it\u2019s growing hyper-quickly and the best days are yet to come. For one, they don\u2019t want to be diluted and left with less of the equity should the day for hitting paydirt eventually arrive. For another, potential outside investors become uneasy when founders start taking any real money off the table. And until they\u2019ve sold, a paper valuation is just that: paper.\n\nKoala Mattress co-founder Mitch Taylor started the company with Byron Bay childhood buddy Dany Milham in 2015, self-funded and, a bit later, with a $100,000 investment from cricketer Steve Smith. Now, the business is worth $150 million, and it has propelled Smith\u2019s wealth to $31 million. Taylor, aged 31 and in the 63rd spot on the Young Rich List, says being a founder is exhilarating, but also lonely, particularly in the so-called \u201cbootstrapping\u201d phase. And few people understand it.\n\n\u201cThe first couple of years at Koala I was riding a bike, I couldn\u2019t afford a decent car because every cent was needed in the business to continue growing it. It was funny, I was on the Young Rich List but couldn\u2019t even own a car,\u201d he says, adding it didn\u2019t help that many of his school friends expected him to always pick up the drinks tab as well.\n\nBootstrappers rely usually on personal income and savings, sweat equity, lowest possible operating costs, fast inventory turnaround, and a cash-only approach to selling.\n\nHalf of the entrants to the Financial Review\u2019s Young Rich List have never taken external funding, apart from bank debt. That could reflect the number of sports stars and perhaps also the strong showing of the tech sector, which often requires less investment.\n\nEqually, it might raise questions about some of the unrealistic valuations at which the founders would like to sell a stake in their business.\n\n\u201cThey used to say in the old days, revenue is for vanity, profit is for sanity ... ultimately that is right,\u201d Thorney Investments\u2019 Waislitz says. \u201cBut on the way through you can create tremendous value, as we\u2019ve seen.\u201d Right now, the market is very aware of this adage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUber was possibly the hottest company in the world, until it listed. Both it and fellow ride-share business Lyft are both trading well below their float prices. In September, VC monster SoftBank pulled the upcoming float of WeWork, slashing its valuation and pushing out its pot-smoking founder, Adam Neumann.\n\nSuddenly a lot of people are raising tough questions about the lofty valuations for companies in the private market. This new scepticism underscores even more the need to partner with a savvy financial backer. It\u2019s a two-way hunt: funds are looking for the real thing; and so are the business builders.\n\nAlium\u2019s Gupta says some founders are so focused on building up the business for an IPO they don\u2019t consider seeking earlier funding. Until it began to formalise, this pool of private growth capital wasn\u2019t widely known about, or easy to find, unless it came knocking. When Dash and McCallum were having beers in Bondi, there weren\u2019t many local funds backing companies at its stage in the lifecycle, and many were heading straight to the United States.\n\nHamish Corlett, TDM Growth Partners: \"It's the toughness that makes founders outstanding.\" Louie Douvis\n\nIndeed Koala, before taking investment from Alium, nearly closed a deal with a US private equity firm, before Taylor and Milham got last-minute cold feet about the equity stake they were giving up.\n\nThey abandoned the deal, and were later introduced to Alium by a venture debt fund (also a newish pool of capital) which structured a deal that enabled the founders to retain control in a relatively straightforward preference-share transaction.\n\nTyro, tipped to be one of the year\u2019s biggest tech floats, didn\u2019t even consider local funding in Australia. It had been planning to raise growth capital in the US when Hamish Corlett of TDM got wind of the raise, and swooped. The fund had been eyeing the company for some months, and moved quickly to make a better offer.\n\nAtlassian, of course, is the one that got away, having tapped private markets in the US ahead of its eventual listing on the NASDAQ. Credible\u2019s Stephen Dash, who\u2019s now based in the US, says the Australian funding market is still minuscule compared with money washing around the private growth capital sector in the States, but it\u2019s growing quickly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Silicon Valley, but there\u2019s now a decent early-stage funding market in Australia,\u201d Dash says. Not that capital is the only thing founders are looking for. They need market nous, and sometimes emotional support as well.\n\nThese days, it\u2019s rare an investor meets a founder who hasn\u2019t already met other growth funds. And more are considering taking private money to grow. Yet unearthing a company to invest in is only half the challenge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, the real edge often lies in convincing the founder that your input will be far more valuable than cash alone. So what happens if you haven\u2019t met each other as investment banking grads?\n\nThese days, more and more companies are being pitched directly to these new funds \u2013 and their offshore counterparts as well.\n\nTDM\u2019s Corlett says the fund is seeing five to 10 times the number it saw in the 18 months before; while Alium\u2019s Gupta says it\u2019s rare to find a local target another fund hasn\u2019t met. Four years ago, the odds were one in two. Clearly, that makes it harder to find the right investment.\n\nAustralia\u2019s private growth capital funds have slightly different criteria for the types of companies they are looking for. But they overlap: they\u2019re all on the hunt for high-growth (20 per cent is bottom of the heap), scalable business models, and an impressive founder and management team. Increasingly, what differentiates one offer of equity from another is the people behind it. And those relationships can be years in the making.\n\nFOMO in the private market is on steroids ... there\u2019s a huge weight of money. \u2014 Hamish Corlett, TDM Growth Partners\n\nIn the case of Alium and Koala, it\u2019s another deal that almost wasn\u2019t. Alium, which has invested in 45 companies and says it has returned 80 per cent to date since inception in 2014, says one in one hundred founders is worth backing.\n\n\u201cWe said \u2018we\u2019re not interested, who wants mattresses?\u2019,\u201d Gupta says. \u201cBut we were blown away when we met them, by their understanding of the market they were disrupting with an asset-light model.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s just the first step. Each fund says there\u2019s no way you can go ahead with an investment unless you back the founder. That\u2019s not always easy to call, and can be easy to get wrong. \u201cBeing an entrepreneur is a bit of a crazy thing to do, so you have to be a bit crazy,\u201d Regal\u2019s McCallum says. But when it works, it really works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having financial uncles,\u201d says Taylor of the Alium Capital team. Gupta and Taylor say they text daily, meet regularly, talk about everything \u2013 from business to family \u2013 and even share leadership coaches.\n\nTDM\u2019s Hamish Corlett agrees that relationships are everything. He has at least a handful of companies he wants to meet quarterly, to offer suggestions and get to know the founders, despite not yet being invested. The key trait he\u2019s looking for in a founder is grit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the toughness that makes them outstanding,\u201d he says, noting that any business will need time in the trenches.\n\n\u201cNo matter how good an Atlassian or Canva or Culture Amp are, these businesses are growing incredibly quickly. Behind that Excel spreadsheet, you go through existential ups and downs. It comes down to that toughness, the ability to pick yourself up \u2026 and ensure underlying it is a passion for the mission.\u201d\n\nCorlett regularly met Didier Elzinga at Culture Amp, talking everything from business to family and more. This long courtship is not only about getting to know one another, it\u2019s about demonstrating that both parties can listen and work together as well. It\u2019s why Thorney\u2019s Waislitz often gives office space to fledgling businesses such as Mesoblast.\n\nMcCallum says his fund has recently narrowed its focus to investments that will list within 12 months, though there is always potential for the timetable to slip. That\u2019s because Regal\u2019s edge is in listed markets, he says. The mantra at Regal is to back a company pre-IPO, and take it all the way to the large cap fund. At least, that\u2019s the ambition.\n\nGetting in early is about more than the return, McCallum says. There\u2019s no insider information restrictions in private markets, and the Regal team soaks up as much information as it can, including getting to really know the founders, before the company goes into blackout pre-IPO. It means private investors can benefit by understanding the business better than counterparts who only invest in listed companies.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason, McCallum says, the fund was confident Credible was the right bet: even while shares traded below the IPO issue price. Indeed Regal was so sure the market had it wrong, it bought more.\n\nFor every Credible, there are many more that go nowhere. The path to profitability or growth can be longer than expected, the team less robust than anticipated or the business model not quite what was hoped for.\n\nIt\u2019s easier to hide in private markets. A smaller-than-expected raising can be dressed up; a founder sell-down explained as a liquidity event; venture debt can be introduced if equity isn\u2019t available. All of that is why down rounds \u2013 when the next round of capital is raised at a lower valuation than the previous rounds \u2013 are rare.\n\nA public listing is a sure-fire step on the path to delivering the real money \u2013 for a founder to actually get hard cash into their hands. But as the market gets increasingly jumpy, isn\u2019t that a risky way to deliver value? Can the floats really keep coming?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI smell it ... there\u2019s going to be a tonne more listings,\u201d Gupta declares, confident the ecosystem is serving up public market-ready companies and investor demand is real. After all, just 7 per cent of the index is tech, compared with 54 per cent in the US.\n\nBut an IPO is also an acid test. \u201cThe public [share]market is the true test of the value of a company over the long term,\u201d says Corlett. \u201cThere\u2019s power in the accountability of being a public company and we think it can bring out the best in companies and management teams.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s liquid: the valuation applied to the company is tradeable, and measurable. He\u2019s enthused about how many companies are now reaching a point where they turn to growth capital domestically, rather than head offshore.\n\nBut there\u2019s also an overriding sense of caution. \u201cThe momentum trading and the fear of missing out [FOMO] dynamic is as prevalent if not more prevalent in the private market, as it is in the public market,\u201d Corlett says, speaking slowly to add emphasis.\n\n\u201cFOMO in the private market is on steroids ... there\u2019s a huge weight of money. With the prevalence of structured instruments and incentives to deploy money, there are certainly ingredients that can lead to some wacky situations.\u201d\n\nAustralia hasn\u2019t seen many of those yet, he adds. It helps that the structures many local growth funds use are different to those in the US, but you can\u2019t entirely structure away greed.\n\nMeanwhile due diligence times are shrinking, and the deal flow is growing. Backing a founder and company takes as much skill as building one. If a clean-out comes, they\u2019ll all be under scrutiny.\n\nThe author has investments with TDM.\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
