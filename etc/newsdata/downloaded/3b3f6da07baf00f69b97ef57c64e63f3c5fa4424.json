I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn\u2019t come close,\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cI SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise. Guys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is - but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\n\u201d \u2018Anchor\u2019 @LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it\u2026And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d he continued.\n\nIn the \u201cDateline\u201d special aired Friday, Mr. Holt gave credit to Mr. Trump by featuring a scene of the president signing the Criminal Justice Reform bill.\n\nMs. Teigen quickly took to Twitter to hit back at the president, calling the president expletives for not tagging her in the tweet directly.\n\n\u201clol what a p\u2013- a\u2014 b\u2013-. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
