As we speak, the police is surrounding the entire neighbourhood looking for me!\" he wrote.\n\n\"They have beaten some of them, arrested & dragged them onto police pick-up cars and driven them to unknown destinations for no offence whatsoever.\"\n\nAmsterdam called the raid \"a clear and brazen act of targeted political repression by the Uganda authorities aimed at violating Bobi Wine's human rights\" and said the concert was \"fully and legally permitted, and the other participating musicians were not targeted.\"\n\nPerformances banned\n\nKyagulanyi is among the most prominent critics of Uganda's longtime President Yoweri Museveni and authorities have repeatedly blocked him from performing publically.\n\n\n\nLast month, a concert was allowed to go ahead only after Kyagulanyi agreed with the police that it would be a non-political event.\n\nMany of Kyagulanyi's songs address issues of social justice and he has called for Museveni, who has been in power for 32 years, to retire.\n\nKyagulanyi was charged with treason in August, along with more than 30 opposition politicians, over the alleged stoning of Museveni's convoy after a campaign rally in the north-western town of Arua.\n\nDuring the campaign, Kyagulanyi's driver was shot dead when soldiers from the elite presidential guard raided the hotel in which he was staying.\n\nThe singer has also accused the security forces of torturing and beating him while in custody and later received medical treatment in the US for the injuries he said he received. The authorities have denied the allegations.\n\nUgandan police have not released a statement on the event, and could not be reached for comment.\n\n* Sign up to News24's top Africa news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO THE HELLO AFRICA NEWSLETTER\n\nFOLLOW News24 Africa on Twitter and Facebook.", "description": "Ugandan popstar turned opposition lawmaker Bobi Wine is in hiding after police raided a hotel he was staying in ahead of a concert, his lawyer has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7965/bd8ddee4039e440e99118cb8cfb96607.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-16"}
