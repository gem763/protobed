Vinny Castilla hit a career-high 46 in 1998 to cap a three-year run of 40 or more.\n\nArenado joins Castilla, Eddie Matthews and Mike Schmidt as the only players to have three 40-homer seasons while playing predominantly third base.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool. They have longevity in this game, they were able to compete for so long and I have the utmost respect for them,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cTo be with them in that category is cool but I\u2019ve got a long ways to go to get to that level.\u201d\n\nArenado has hit 18 homers since Aug. 1, most in the majors, and extended his on-base streak to 18 games during which he is hitting .419.\n\nAfter a July slump the All-Star has found his groove late in the season.\n\n\u201cI train to be able to compete in October,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had my second wind in August and I feel great. My energy\u2019s up.\u201d\n\nJeff Hoffman (2-6) got his first victory since May 29 against Arizona, allowing four runs on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two of his six batters in the first inning but began to settle down after the second inning.\n\n\u201cI told him after the game his last 40 pitches were better than his first 50,\u201d Rockies manager Bud Black said. \u201cHe battled, I loved how he competed. We picked him up but he kept battling. Good for him.\u201d\n\nHoffman got plenty of help from his defense. Arenado caught a scorching liner from Eric Hosmer and doubled up Greg Garcia to end the first and Garrett Hampson made a leaping catch at the wall in center to rob Garcia of extra bases in the third.\n\n\u201cHos crushes the ball to third, turns into a double play. Kind of let (Hoffman) off the hook there,\u201d San Diego manager Andy Green said. \u201cIf that shoots by Arenado, it\u2019s a different feeling baseball game.\u201d\n\nStory and Hampson hit back-to-back shots in a five-run fourth to make it 8-2, but the Padres sent 11 batters to the plate in the sixth to get within one.\n\nStory hit a solo homer in the sixth, his 32nd, to make it 9-7. San Diego scored in the seventh and the Rockies added a run in the eighth.\n\nJairo Diaz got the final three outs to pick up his fourth save of the season and his third in the last four games.\n\nAustin Hedges hit a two-run homer, his 11th, in the second for the Padres.\n\nSan Diego starter Joey Lucchesi (10-8) was roughed up for eight runs on nine hits through 3 2/3 innings. He left in the fourth after Story and Hampson homered.\n\n\u201cI came in here with confidence. I feel super comfortable here,\u201d Lucchesi said. \u201cI thought it was going to go my way, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPadres: OF Hunter Renfroe remained out with a right ankle injury that has limited him to one appearance and no starts since Sept. 4. Green said Renfroe had hoped to play in this series. \u201cBeen a slow process, he\u2019s frustrated not being able to play here,\u201d Green said.\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (left groin strain) is scheduled to throw his third bullpen since going on the 10-day injured list on Aug. 22. Trainer Keith Dugger said Freeland would throw two simulated innings.\n\nDAHL DONE\n\nColorado outfielder David Dahl was putting together a solid season when a high right ankle sprain on Aug. 2 landed him on the IL. Black confirmed Friday that Dahl won\u2019t be back this season.\n\nThe 25-year-old Dahl has dealt with injuries throughout his career, including one to his rib that cost him all of 2017. He finished 2019 hitting .302 with 15 home runs in a career-high 100 games and was named to his first All-Star Game.\n\n\u201cThe numbers speak for themselves. I wish it could\u2019ve been through the end of the year and it really could\u2019ve been something,\u201d Black said. \u201cBut that\u2019s a lot to build on. That was a very solid year.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres LHP Eric Lauer (8-8, 4.41 ERA) will face RHP Peter Lambert (2-6, 6.86) on Saturday night. Lauer has a 19.73 ERA in three career starts at Coors Field, and Lambert is looking for his first win in his last 16 starts.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Nolan Arenado continued his torrid hitting and blasted his way into the record books to lead the Colorado Rockies to another close victory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Kelly"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/padres_rockies_baseball_34464_c0-222-4082-2602_s1770x1032.jpg?57025f0961c2f7d2b0d22f315da90a7308963c6c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
