(Taylor Glascock/For The Washington Post)\n\nDanielle Rizzo\u2019s son is screaming. He is planted in the middle of the lobby of his elementary school, clinging to rainbow-colored blocks as she gently explains that she is here \u2014 off schedule, in the middle of the day \u2014 to take him to a doctor\u2019s appointment. But the first-grader is not listening.\n\n\u201cHappy Meal,\u201d he repeats over and over again. \u201cHappy Meal!\u201d\n\nHis little brother, who is also going to the appointment, is nearby, not moving. Rizzo is relieved that the two of them are not melting down at the same time, which happens all too often, and firmly guides them out the door.\n\nRizzo\u2019s children, ages 7 and 6, were at the center of one of the most ethically complex legal cases in the modern-day fertility industry. Three years ago, while researching treatment options for her sons, Rizzo says she made an extraordinary discovery: The boys are part of an autism cluster involving at least a dozen children scattered across the United States, Canada and Europe, all conceived with sperm from the same donor. Many of the children have secondary diagnoses of ADHD, dyslexia, mood disorders, epilepsy and other developmental and learning disabilities.\n\nThe phenomenon is believed to be unprecedented and has attracted the attention of some of the world\u2019s foremost experts in the genetics of autism, who have been gathering blood and spit samples from the families.\n\nAutism, which affects an estimated 1 of 59 children in the United States, is a \u201cspectrum disorder\u201d characterized by difficulties navigating social situations and restricted or repetitive behavior. Some people who have it never speak and need daily care, while others, like actress Daryl Hannah and Pok\u00e9mon creator Satoshi Tajiri, are highly successful in their fields. In recent years a growing movement has been challenging the notion that autism is a disorder at all. Rather, advocates argue, it\u2019s a difference that should be celebrated as adding diversity to human communities.\n\nRizzo hopes her children will cope better as they grow older, but for now, she knows they are suffering.\n\nWhen she first found out about their many half-siblings, she consulted a genetic counselor, who she says told her the odds of so many blood-related children with autism occurring spontaneously was akin to all the mothers \u201copening up a dictionary and pointing to the same letter of the same word on the same page at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the donor,\u201d Rizzo remembered thinking. \u201cIt had to be.\u201d\n\nA quick online search for the donor\u2019s profile showed that sperm from a man matching his description was still being sold by at least four companies. She called them all, asking for information about his medical history \u2014 and to inform them of the autism cluster \u2014 but she says the representatives she reached told her she didn\u2019t have any \u201cevidence\u201d that his sperm was responsible for the autism cases.\n\nShe turned to health-care regulators in New York and California, where the sperm banks were based. The response, Rizzo said, was that cases like hers are not part of their responsibility. (A spokeswoman for New York State said her department had no record of Rizzo\u2019s complaint but urged her \u201cto reach out.\u201d A California spokesperson said the state would consider investigating her case as an \u201cadverse event\u201d related to a sperm bank.)\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration told her its oversight of the sperm-donor industry is limited to screening for sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nSo, after a year of fruitless phone calls and letters, she sued.\n\n\n\nRizzo watches her sons look for their lost frog in their backyard. (Taylor Glascock/For The Washington Post)\n\nMotherhood\n\nRizzo turned to a sperm bank when she was 27 years old and a business banker at a JPMorgan Chase branch. She and her partner, who asked that her name not be used to protect her privacy, had been together for eight years. They met while Rizzo was attending community college on a softball scholarship. Rizzo was the team\u2019s pitcher; her partner was an assistant coach. In June 2011, when Illinois began issuing civil union licenses to same-sex couples, they were the first in line at the Kane County courthouse.\n\nRizzo says they were eager to start their family and decided that Rizzo, younger by two years, would carry the baby. For months, the couple scoured online profiles to find just the right sperm donor.\n\nDonor H898 from Idant Laboratories looked like a winner.\n\nHe was blond and blue-eyed, 6-foot-1, 240 pounds, and appeared to be smart and accomplished. His profile said he had a master\u2019s degree and was working as a medical photographer. His hobbies included long-distance running, reading and art.\n\nAnd most important, Rizzo says, he had a clean bill of health, according to his profile \u2014 having scribbled \u201cNA\u201d and a strikethrough line on all but one of the more than 100 medical questions, including mental health ones, posed by sperm banks. (His paternal grandfather had had prostate cancer at age 85.)\n\nOver the next few months, Rizzo purchased several vials of sperm. The bill came to about $500.\n\nRizzo\u2019s first son, conceived via in vitro fertilization, was born in September 2011, and the first year of his life was bliss. He hit all his milestones on time \u2014 sitting up, rolling over, crawling and waving, saying \u201chi\u201d and \u201cbye.\u201d Rizzo was \u201cmama,\u201d and her partner \u201cmommy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the happiest baby,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWe knew we wanted one more kid.\u201d\n\nDoctors transferred another embryo, and their second boy was born about 14 months after the first.\n\nIt was around that time that Rizzo says they started noticing unusual behaviors in their first son. He had stopped looking his mothers in the eye. He no longer responded to his name. He wouldn\u2019t interact with other children, and when he played with toys he would line things up or turn cars upside down and just spin the wheels, over and over again. She was devastated when her second child, at around age 2, began to exhibit the same behaviors.\n\nRizzo sought help from the state\u2019s early-intervention services and a developmental pediatrician, and both boys were diagnosed with autism. She soon found herself thrown into the frenzied world of special-needs parenting.\n\nShe and her partner took turns running the boys to therapies. But the more months that passed, the more help the boys seemed to need. Instead of one day off, she started taking two, then three.\n\n\u201cThe screaming, the hitting, the yelling, the pinching, the punching, the pulling my hair when I\u2019m driving,\u201d she said, describing her days. After three nannies quit, Rizzo left her job, and her relationship collapsed.\n\nRizzo received primary custody, and with two preschoolers with severe needs, she says she was financially strapped. Her ex had been fulfilling her obligation to pay child support, but Rizzo says it wasn\u2019t enough to cover the mortgage. The house went into foreclosure. Rizzo went on Medicaid, and in July 2018 she and the two boys moved into her parents\u2019 basement.\n\n\n\nRizzo\u2019s sons walk in their backyard. (Taylor Glascock/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe lawsuit\n\nSperm donors tend to be taller, better looking and better educated than the general population. But they have the same chance of carrying a gene for an inherited condition as anyone else.\n\nAnd because of their unusual role in modern reproduction, the effect of those mutations can be amplified. Popular donors can father 10, 20, 100 or even more progeny \u2014 each potentially carrying the same genetic risk factors.\n\nRizzo has never had contact with the donor, who is now in his early 40s and from the New York area. But two other mothers who have met him said in interviews that he is clean-cut and polite. One described him as \u201chot.\u201d Another said her first impression of the donor, who showed up wearing khakis and a nice shirt, was that he is \u201cbrave\u201d and \u201cgenerous.\u201d The parents had happily connected on Facebook and Yahoo groups for \u201cdonor siblings\u201d \u2014 and then were shocked to discover that many of their children seemed to have the same types of developmental challenges and diagnoses.\n\nDonor H898\u2019s sperm was offered through multiple sources. According to the mothers, court documents and genetic testing through 23andMe and Ancestry.com, he sold anonymously to at least four sperm banks (which typically pay about $100 per visit), donated to a high-end agency that matches parents with donors they can meet face-to-face, and offered his sperm for a low fee or even free on sites such as KnownDonorRegistry.com or privately.\n\nHis profile stood out in many ways, women who used his sperm said, citing the thoughtful answers in his essays and audio interview. \u201cI dislike dishonest and wasteful people,\u201d he wrote in one statement. \u201cI have my own garden and go to the Met when I can.\u201d\n\nRizzo filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in July 2017. In her complaint, she alleged that his online profile was a lie and that he was not an \u201cappropriate candidate for sperm donation.\u201d She sued Idant and Daxor, Idant\u2019s former parent company, under the state\u2019s consumer fraud and deceptive practices act.\n\nShe says in the complaint that research, based on public documents and calls to his relatives, showed that the donor had no college degrees, had been diagnosed with ADHD, and \u201cwent to a school for children with learning and emotional disabilities.\u201d (Idant, and other sperm banks, generally do not verify their donors\u2019 medical and educational backgrounds.) Moreover, her attorneys wrote in the filing, \u201cDonor H898 is a prolific sperm donor who has fathered at least 12 children through sperm donation, and that each of those children has either been diagnosed with Autism, or suffers from signs and symptoms associated with Autism.\u201d In court documents, other mothers corroborated the story.\n\nGuidelines from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which represents fertility clinics in the United States, call for mandatory genetic testing for only one disease: cystic fibrosis. But most clinics say they test for several hundred. There is no test for autism.\n\nIdant was one of the nation\u2019s oldest sperm banks until it shut down around 2015 . In 2009, it was sued by a woman whose child had Fragile X Syndrome, a developmental disorder that is among the conditions typically detected in genetic tests. The suit was dismissed because the plaintiffs could not define a \u201clegally-cognizable injury.\u201d In 2004, state inspectors found that Idant had ignored the requirement that sperm donors be tested for genetic and sexually transmitted diseases. It was temporarily closed by New York state regulators in 1995 for failing to pass along information about \u201chigh-risk social and sexual behavior. And in the 1990s, Idant settled a lawsuit from a white mother who said it gave her the wrong sperm, from a black donor.\n\nOfficials from Daxor, Idant\u2019s former parent company, said in a statement that Rizzo\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cmeritless.\u201d In court filings, Idant attorneys called the accusations by Rizzo \u201cinflammatory, specious and dangerous,\u201d and said her claims did not establish that the company \u201cknew any of the alleged representations to be false.\u201d\n\nCiting privacy concerns, the sperm banks declined to contact the donor regarding a request for an interview, and he did not respond to messages left on an online profile.\n\nRochester Cryobank, which also sold sperm from the same donor, has gone out of business. Manhattan Cryobank, now part of California Cryobank, said that the donor had over a dozen successful births with zero reports of any children affected by autism. It confirmed that it had refunded the payment made by a woman who had purchased the donor\u2019s sperm but had not yet used it; she heard about Rizzo\u2019s lawsuit and asked for her money back. But the company said the donor\u2019s sperm was not removed from its inventory because it did not have enough information to further investigate the autism link.\n\nAs of August, Repro Lab was still selling vials, priced at $450-$525, from the donor. A Repro Lab official said they received a report from an anonymous caller regarding an increased risk of autism, but the report was \u201cunsubstantiated,\u201d as the donor \u201cdid not report any history of autism in his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would deny participation to a donor in our program if he or any first-degree relative had a history of autism,\u201d the company said.\n\n\n\nDanielle Rizzo holds hands with her younger son. Rizzo\u2019s boys are part of an autism cluster involving at least a dozen children conceived with sperm from the same donor. (Taylor Glascock/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe scientist\n\nDesperate for help, Rizzo Googled \u201cworld renowned geneticist\u201d and \u201cautism\u201d and came up with the University of Toronto\u2019s Stephen Scherer\u2019s name on several research papers and a YouTube video.\n\n\u201cI have two boys ages 3 & 4 that have been diagnosed and live with autism,\u201d she emailed. \u201cI have connected with other moms from the same sperm donor. We have found that 7 or 8 children have been diagnosed with autism. . . . This was a shock and devastation to say the least.\u201d\n\nScherer was so intrigued that he replied at 4:36 a.m. He had never heard of such a large cluster in one generation of a biological family. \u201cIt was the perfect kind of genetic experiment,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Scherer\u2019s lab, based at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, has been collecting, cataloguing and trying to find patterns in the DNA of families affected by autism. It has more than 20,000 samples. A similar project, called SPARK and funded by the Simons Foundation in New York, has amassed 85,000.\n\nScientists know of more than 100 genes that appear to be associated with autism. Some are inherited, while others occur as new mutations. (Other factors have been linked to autism, including an older father or complications during pregnancy. A proposed link to vaccines was based on fraudulent research and has been disproved.)\n\nMost mutations associated with autism do not definitively cause the condition; they only increase someone\u2019s risk. But, Scherer says, an intriguing subset of \u201chigh impact\u201d genes \u2014 estimated to be involved in 5 to 20 percent of all autism cases \u2014 appears to directly result in autism.\n\n\u201cWe call autism one thing, but it\u2019s different in every person. In some it\u2019s all about the genes. Some it\u2019s a combination of genes and the environment. Some people, it\u2019s unknown,\u201d said Wendy Chung, a professor of pediatric medicine at Columbia University and principal investigator of SPARK.\n\nWhen researchers tested Rizzo\u2019s older son\u2019s blood, Rizzo says they found two gene mutations linked to autism \u2014 MBD1 and SHANK1. Her younger son has the MBD1 variant. Rizzo said all seven of the half-siblings whose parents had them tested have at least one of these mutations.\n\nNeither was inherited from Rizzo, according to the tests, she said. While the research is still preliminary and the donor could have numerous other biological children who are not on the autism spectrum, Scherer says, \u201cour hypothesis is that it\u2019s something in his DNA.\u201d\n\n\n\nRizzo\u2019s sons cover their ears as a loud vehicle drives by. Noise sensitivity is a common challenge for people with autism spectrum disorders. (Taylor Glascock/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe children\n\nDoctors diagnose autism based on behaviors \u2014 rigidity, repetitive habits, difficulty with seeing things from someone else\u2019s perspective.\n\nRizzo\u2019s sons can speak, and the older is starting to read and write. Doctors have told her they are somewhere in the middle of the autism spectrum.\n\nBoth are still in diapers, throw their hands over their ears when there is a loud sound, and have not made friends at school. The elder\u2019s huge blue eyes light up when he\u2019s spinning and flapping his arms. The younger gets very upset if someone stands close to him, and has trouble engaging in conversations about anything other than Super Mario Bros. The boys, who attend an intensive autism therapy program at school, have daily meltdowns.\n\nAs for the other children Rizzo discovered, one half brother around their age who lives on the East Coast is mainstreamed in school and a gentle and happy child, his mother said in an interview. But he is several years behind in school. Another half brother is very high functioning, his mother says, but is in full-time special education because of difficulties with speech and dyslexia.\n\nRizzo loves her children, and said she believes God gave them to her for a reason. She finds a lot of joy in simple moments such as taking them to water parks, sharing slushies and piling into one bed reading \u201cCaptain Underpants\u201d and \u201cDog Man.\u201d But she wishes things could be easier for them, and she worries for their future.\n\n\u201cIf I knew then what I know now, I don\u2019t know if I would have ever used a sperm bank,\u201d she said.\n\nOn March 14, she agreed to end the lawsuit by accepting an offer of $250,000 from the company.\n\nAfter the lawyers took their share, her ex \u2014 who takes care of the children one day a week and every other weekend \u2014 was awarded half of the rest. Rizzo said she desperately needed the money to pay for behavioral and social-skills therapies not covered by public assistance, to create a trust for the boys\u2019 long-term care, and so that the family could get their own apartment.\n\nShe hopes her case will push government regulators to impose greater oversight of the sperm bank industry. \u201cI did not sue because my children are autistic. I was suing to right a wrong.\u201d\n\nIn late June, Rizzo heard of another mom with a boy \u2014 1 \u00bd years old \u2014 who had used the same sperm donor. After agonizing, Rizzo contacted the woman and told her she had some \u201cheavy information\u201d about the donor and his offspring. The woman declined to hear it.\n\n\n\nRizzo\u2019s sons were part of a legal case that has been settled.
