After initially rejecting millions in foreign aid, Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro recently banned the use of fires to clear land, including those in the rainforest, for a very conservative 60 days.\n\nIf you want to better understand the scope of the devastation, this week, Buzzfeed News put together a map of all the fires that burned in the Amazon during August, using available data from NASA. Using the map, you can drag the slider to any date to witness the scale and number of fires that day.\n\nAs the Washington Post points out, it\u2019s important to note several things that aren\u2019t immediately obvious with satellite maps like these.\n\nFor one, despite public perception that the heart of the Amazon was burning, many of the fires took place alongside the fringes of the rainforest, not at its centre. (You\u2019ll notice the fires remain mostly along the southern part of the Amazon\u2019s basin, roughly where the bottom-half of Peru meets the Maranh\u00e3o state in northeast Brazil.)\n\nAlso, these recent fires are mostly set in areas that have already been deforested in previous years; as the Post writes, these lands were mostly cleared for agricultural use. For this reason, you can\u2019t necessarily assume a fire correlates to recent deforestation \u2014 that process could have already happened in the area prior to the blaze.\n\nAs of Thursday, the rainforest is still burning. And in the 48 hours following Bolsonaro\u2019s ban on fires to clear lands last week, the Independent reports that roughly 4,000 new forest fires began in Brazil, with nearly half of them in the Amazon.\n\nIf you want to help preserve the rainforest or communities of indigenous people that live in its basin, take a look at our guide to finding and donating to credible organisations.", "description": "In August, roughly 66,000 fires ravaged the Amazon rainforest, much of it the result of man-made deforestation.
