Only 12 schools in this final category took part in the survey.\n\n\u201cThese findings indicate that pupils in schools with a higher proportion of free school meals are less likely to experience the range of positive benefits a school library can provide,\u201d the report said.\n\nResearch has shown the benefits include improving reading and writing skills, more enjoyment of reading and improving general academic achievement, the study added.\n\nThe vast majority of secondaries (96%) said they had a school library, compared with 85% of primaries.\n\nMore than half (59%) of school libraries were reported to be used as a classroom for non-library lessons, and a similar proportion (51%) were used for meetings.\n\nA third of schools said pupils continued to have access to the library space while it was being used for an alternative purpose.\n\nThe survey was commissioned by the Great School Libraries campaign, a three-year project which aims to ensure all children have access to a decent school library\n\nNick Poole, chief executive of CILIP, a library and information association, said: \u201cWe welcome this landmark report as the first comprehensive picture of the state of play in our school libraries.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it is a testament to the head teachers, teachers, governors and librarians that value and promote the importance of school libraries for learners and their school.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, the research paints a picture of inequality of access and opportunity and insecure employment that we cannot accept.\n\n\u201cThe findings highlight the urgency of securing national school library strategies and investment in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, drawing on the example of Scotland.\u201d\n\nShadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: \u201cThese figures show the consequences of cuts the Tories have imposed on our schools. Even worse, it is clear that the highest price is being paid by those who most need the extra help.\u201d\n\nA Department for Education spokeswoman said: \u201cWe want all children to have the opportunity to read widely \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve strengthened the national curriculum to focus on developing reading skills, and increased the focus on phonics to help children acquire the basic building blocks of reading.\u201d\n\nShe added that the extra education funding recently announced will allow schools to invest more in teachers and resources, including libraries.", "description": "A new study says there is `inequality in access\u00b4 to school libraries.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/00/wire-19812370-1571267053-745_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
