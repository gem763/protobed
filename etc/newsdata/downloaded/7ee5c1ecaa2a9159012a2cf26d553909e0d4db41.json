In an interview with Merrill president Andy Sieg, he told BI wealth reporter Rebecca Ungarino that the firm plans to hire more than 1,500 financial adviser trainees this year, while scaling back on experienced hires.\n\nWhy is this such a big deal?\n\nThe firm is aiming to stay competitive as the war for financial adviser talent ratchets up in a tight US labor market \u2014 and around a third of advisers across the industry are expected to retire in the next decade.\n\nWells Fargo's adviser arm also told us it's launched a new pitch to draw new talent.\n\nIt's been tough for the wealth industry to convince new college grads to join their ranks. Young people working in wealth tell Business Insider that the allure of lucrative fields like tech, the daunting challenge of drumming up business as a newbie, and lingering unease with the industry for those who came of age during the financial crisis help explain why the jobs may have seemed less appealing.\n\nYet the future of the industry to find the next generation of top advisors is crucial. The average adviser's age is around 52, according to Cerulli Associates data, and many are seen retiring over the next decade. Only around 9% are under 35.\n\nSeparately, we've also been writing a lot about the race to zero-fee commissions among the online brokers in the last few days. Interactive Brokers, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and E-Trade all moved to eliminate fees for US-listed trades in late September and early October, in turn wiping out huge chunks of the companies' market caps.\n\nThere are a number of important factors influencing the choice to dump fees, Rebecca reports. Legacy brokers and big banks alike are rushing to compete with digital entrants for younger users. Meanwhile, US interest rates are falling at a faster clip than analysts had earlier expected.\n\nBut while the e-brokers' stock prices are feeling pain, Brett Redfearn, the SEC's trading and markets head, praised their decision to slash fees during an investor conference in Washington this week.\n\n\"It is always good to see competition bringing down prices for investors,\" Redfearn said.\n\nStay tuned for more from BI as we continue to follow this trend and let us know what else we should be watching in the wealth space.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\nOlivia", "description": "Wall Street Insider is a behind-the-scenes look at the stories dominating banking, business, and big deals.", "authors": ["Olivia Oran"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d5d9d9ead2b4703aa7d3626?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
