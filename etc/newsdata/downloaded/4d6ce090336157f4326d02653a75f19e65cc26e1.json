It does not have the power to arrest people or enforce law, but it can notify its members when a member country is seeking the arrest and extradition of an alleged criminal.\n\nThe agency uses a color-coded \u201cnotice\u201d system to communicate among members. The most urgent of these is the Red Notice, which urges countries to \u201cseek the location and arrest of wanted persons wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence.\u201d Other notices identify individuals who are not criminals but may have information related to a crime or are \u201cimminent threats.\u201d\n\nAt its most recent General Assembly last week, Interpol announced that Turkey will host the next iteration. Turkey\u2019s national police directorate thanked the 108 nations who voted to give Ankara hosting rights and disparaged \u201cGreek Cypriots,\u201d whose island is partially occupied by Turkish forces, for discouraging support for the Islamist Turkish government.\n\nOffering Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the honor of hosting Interpol\u2019s annual conference is the latest in a series of mounting warning signs that Interpol, intended to weaken criminal forces around the world, has been hijacked by rogue regimes using it to impose their authoritarian will on the world. Turkey\u2019s prominence in the organization is particularly alarming given that Interpol agreed to resolutions at its General Assembly last week encouraging private entities to cooperate with its demands for information, ostensibly to help nations fight crime more efficiently.\n\nAccording to a report published this month by Voice of America, rogue states have increasingly abused the Red Notice system to force other countries to arrest and extradite political dissidents \u2013 or even some merely suspected of dissidence but not outspoken against their governments. Any Interpol member nation can file for a Red Notice against any individual and, while Interpol has the right to reject the request, it often takes the application at face value.\n\nCountries now use an online system to file for Red Notices, which requires minimal effort or due diligence on the part of the requesting state. Interpol reportedly issued over 13,000 Red Notices against individuals last year.\n\nVoice of America listed Turkey as the \u201cmost prolific abuser\u201d of the system, followed by Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nTurkey\u2019s abuse of the system peaked in 2016, following the failed attempt to overthrow Erdogan on July 15. The individuals responsible for the coup identified themselves as secularist military leaders, but Erdogan insisted they were members of a cult led by Fethullah G\u00fclen, an Islamic cleric based in Pennsylvania. Formerly an Erdogan ally, G\u00fclen founded an Islamic movement known as \u201cHizmet,\u201d or \u201cservice,\u201d with an emphasis on the construction of schools and charity work. Erdogan\u2019s government calls Hizmet the \u201cFethullahist Terrorist Organization\u201d (FETO) and has detained over 100,000 people alleged to have ties to the regime.\n\nMany of those arrested for ties to G\u00fclen faced no legitimate evidence against them. Many were soldiers, teachers, professors, doctors, and other professionals, and many remain in prison for their \u201ccrimes\u201d at press time without due process.\n\nAmerican Pastor Andrew Brunson, who preached in Turkey for 23 years, was arrested in 2016 for, among a host of other unsubstantiated accusations, being a Gulenist. He had never knowingly met a Gulenist before being arrested, he wrote in his recently released autobiography, which is the only known English-language first-hand account of the conditions \u201cGulenists\u201d are currently imprisoned in.\n\nThe Turkish judicial system is extremely \u201cpolitical\u201d and unreliable, Brunson told Breitbart News in an interview this week. \u201cThey accused me of different things at different times. They were trying to find something that would fit, so they would change their minds a lot and then they would drop the previous accusations,\u201d he noted.\n\nOf the \u201cGulenists\u201d imprisoned with him, Brunson said, \u201cnot a single one of them was involved with anything to do with the coup \u2026 most of them were fathers whose children are growing up without having their father at home, and that\u2019s just a terrible injustice.\u201d\n\nTurkey reportedly flooded Interpol with 60,000 Red Notice requests against \u201cGulenists\u201d in the aftermath of the coup. News reports indicated that Interpol was forced to lock the Turkish government out of its system, a claim Interpol later denied. Among those persecuted through Interpol Red Notices is NBA star Enes Kanter, who was nearly arrested on two occasions traveling for NBA games and has since refused to leave the United States for fear of extradition into the prison cells Brunson endured.\n\nInterpol has in the past rejected Red Notice requests from authoritarian regimes. The most prominent recent case was that of Dolkun Isa, the head of the World Uyghur Congress \u2013 a human rights advocate China has branded as a \u201cterrorist\u201d for defying the communist regime. Interpol removed a Red Notice against Isa, requested by China, in February 2018. Eight months later, China abducted and disappeared the president of Interpol, Meng Hongwei, in a trip to visit his family in the country. Chinese authorities accused Meng of bribery in a murky legal proceeding and have not offered proof of life since June.\n\nMeng\u2019s wife Grace has filed for political asylum in France, where Interpol headquarters are located, and sued Interpol for failing to protect him from the regime.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency announced Tuesday that the country will host the 2021 Interpol General Assembly.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/GettyImages-652409948.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
