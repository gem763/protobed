He can\u2019t even get along with the Democrats, and he goes around signing all these executive orders. It\u2019s a basic disaster. You can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBut Trump appears to have learned what his predecessors discovered as well: It\u2019s easier and often more satisfying to get things done through administrative action than to get Congress to go along, said Andrew Rudalevige, a professor at Bowdoin College who studies the history and effectiveness of presidential executive actions.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
