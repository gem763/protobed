Mr Strzok was removed from the Mueller inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election after it emerged he had sent messages critical of Mr Trump to Ms Page, with whom he was having an affair.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I have no idea why we are going here.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Everyone Trump has fired or forced out Show all 13 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

This is exactly why President Trump is upset and why his supporters are upset at the news media.\u201d\n\nAs he appears to return to Mr Strzok and Ms Page, saying \u201cNow here\u2019s the deal\u201d, Mr Todd attempts unsuccessfully to steer him back to the question at hand, eventually shouting: \u201cSenator Johnson! Senator Johnson, please! Can we please answer the question that I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticising him.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has reacted angrily to any criticism from Republicans. As Meet the Press was going to air he tweeted abusive messages about Mitt Romney, the Utah senator and former Republican presidential candidate, who has admitted disquiet over Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour.\n\nThe argument between Mr Todd and Mr Johnson came after a political science expert claimed that Republicans in Congress \u201call have beef\u201d with the president but are too afraid of him to speak out. \u201cThey stick with him to get the judicial appointments, the tax cuts. If he weakens, that fear will subside,\u201d said Cal Jillson, a professor at Southern Methodist University.\n\nThe heated exchange on Meet the Press continued with Mr Todd trying to pin down Mr Johnson on whether he trusted the CIA and FBI, both of which have been regular targets for Mr Trump.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Asked if he trusts the intelligence agencies now, almost three years after Barack Obama left office, he refuses to give a straight answer, eventually asking: \u201cWho do you mean?\u201d and listing individuals who have been criticised by Mr Trump.\n\nHe then repeatedly says that he \u201cjust wants the truth\u201d, accuses the show of \u201csetting this thing up, totally biased\u201d and says: \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to go through all the things I can talk about \u2026. I would never be able to get the truth out.\u201d\n\nMr Todd then shakes his head and says: \u201cSenator, I don\u2019t know why you just came on here to personally attack the press and avoid answering questions about what happened here. Senator, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re only dealing with the facts that we have, not the facts that you wish them to be.\u201d\n\nMr Trump is accused of abusing his office by trying to persuade foreign leaders to dig up or even fabricate dirt on his political rivals. He insists he has done nothing wrong and instead is accusing Joe Biden, his potential rival in the 2020 election, of being corrupt, but without so far producing any evidence.", "description": "The host of one of America\u2019s leading political shows angrily interrupted\u00a0a Republican senator who ignored his questions and instead embarked on a rant about conspiracy theories known to be close to Donald Trump\u2019s heart.", "authors": ["Phil Thomas"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/17/chuck-todd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
