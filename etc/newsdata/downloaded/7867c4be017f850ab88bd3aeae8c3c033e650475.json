The US economy saw employment rise by in August, with private payrolls posting a soft 96,000 gain, as 25,000 temporary government workers were hired for the 2020 Census count.\n\nThe employment report pretty much cements only a 25-basis point at the September 18th meeting. The global growth outlook remains soft and it is unlikely we get a landmark moment in the trade war this month that will ease businesses\u2019 concerns that is making them hesitate with capex and investments.\n\nWith aggregate weekly payrolls continuing a strong trend and better than expected , stagflation concerns may make the Fed a little hesitant in following through with as many rate cuts the market is pricing in over the next six months. The took a hit across the board and US stocks extended pre-market gains as the punchbowl seems set to overflow with future actions from both the Fed and PBOC.\n\nChina\u2019s RRR cut was widely expected after the State Council on Wednesday signalled a cut was coming soon on Wednesday. The PBOC\u2019s reserve requirement ratio cut of 50 basis points will take effect on September 16th, with additional cuts taking place for some commercial banks occurring in two steps on October 15th and November 15th.\n\nChinese futures popped higher but we didn\u2019t see a broader rally as the move was telegraphed and we didn\u2019t see a deeper cut. This round of easing provides modest stimulus to the economy as China will wait to see what happens with the next round of trade talks. The PBOC will unleash a significant wave of stimulus if we see trade talks fall apart again in the coming weeks.\n\nToday\u2019s RRR cut is just the beginning and regardless how the trade war unfolds, we will see the further efforts from the PBOC.\n\nCAD\n\nThe rose after the release of the August jobs report. The Canadian economy added , beating the expectations of a 23,800 gain. Full time and part time employment saw gains, but it was the part time sector where most of the gains came from.\n\nThe is headed towards the 1.32 price level after the NFP underperformed with a 130,000 job gains in the United States in August. The forecast called for a range above 150,000. Employment continues to be solid, but the US dollar is sensitive to data misses as the Fed is getting ready to cut rates this month. This does not help their case of patience and the market will focus on next week\u2019s inflation and retail sales data.\n\nOil\n\nOil\u2019s price action is still focused on global demand concerns and was little fazed to the labour market report. The topline numbers were disappointing, but with wages rising fast this year, the mixed report shows signs the US consumer is still strong and demand for crude in America will remain intact.\n\nAnother key story for oil is the continued progress Iran is having with the EU in possibly salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal. If we start to see Iran get some relief and tensions ease in the Persian Gulf, we could see that be an unexpected headwind for higher oil prices.\n\nGold rallied after job growth struggled in August, but the overall report was not as negative to completely support the doves.\n\nGold\u2019s bullish rally is still facing some exhaustion and this employment report is doing little to fully reinvigorate longer-term bullish bets just yet. Strong support remains at the $1,470 to $1,500 range, but it seems gold will settle comfortably above $1,500 for the week. Until we get to the ECB , we may see gold trade rangebound.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by MarketPulse (Ed Moya) covering: USD/CAD, XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures.
