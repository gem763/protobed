Now, Aaron has found unlikely support in early-aughts singer Melissa Schuman, who accused Nick of rape in 2017.\n\nOn Tuesday, the younger Carter responded to the news of the restraining order on Twitter, writing, \u201cSo my brother just got a restraining order against me. And I was just served lol.\u201d In two separate tweets, he added, \u201cTake care. @nickcarter we\u2019re done for life\u201d and \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in four years. And I don\u2019t intend.\u201d\n\nNick, on the other hand, chose to release a lengthy Notes-apps-by-way-of-Twitter statement citing his brother\u2019s violent and erratic behavior as the reason behind his decision. \u201cAfter careful consideration, my sister Angel and I regret that we were required to seek a restraining order against our brother Aaron today,\u201d the Backstreet Boys singer wrote. \u201cIn light of Aaron\u2019s increasingly alarming behavior and his recent confession that he harbors thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child, we were left with no choice but to take every measure possible to protect ourselves and our family.\u201d Carter shared the note with the hashtags \u201c#mentalhealth,\u201d \u201c#GunControlNow,\u201d and \u201c#GunControl.\u201d\n\nIn apparent response to the statement, Aaron tweeted, \u201cI am astounded at the accusations being made against me and I do not wish to harm anyone, especially my family.\u201d Then, taking a more threatening tone, he wrote, \u201cAll I ask is for my family to leave me alone. This is blood. Not love. I will never be around you and I don\u2019t want to be around you. I am the one who said I\u2019m done then you send me this!? Ok. Stop trying to get me 5150\u2019d before I file a harassment suit myself nick I have the $.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, the restraining order filing states that in an alarming FaceTime with his twin sister Angel last month, the \u201cI Want Candy\u201d singer allegedly told Angel that he had violent thoughts about \u201ckilling babies\u201d and he \u201cthink[s] about killing Lauren Kitt,\u201d Nick\u2019s pregnant wife. The TMZ report says that the police supposedly conducted a welfare check the day after the concerning FaceTime conversation. It also notes that in the court documents, Nick alleges that Aaron owns six firearms that are \u201creadily available.\u201d\n\nThough the messy feud between the Carter brothers has been going on for years, it reached a new level in the wake of the restraining order announcement when Aaron began to tweet about his brother\u2019s alleged history of violence against women, siding with his accusers. Early Wednesday morning, Aaron suggested that the restraining order was actually an act of retaliation \u201cbecause I live streamed with one of his accusers.\u201d In other tweets, he accused his brother of sexually assaulting multiple women and underage girls. His tweetstorm eventually caught the attention of Melissa Schuman, former member of the teen girl band Dream, after he began tagging both her and #MeToo activist Rose McGowan.\n\nSchuman first publicly accused Nick Carter of sexual assault in 2017, emboldened by the #MeToo movement. She wrote an essay claiming that Carter assaulted her in 2002 when she was 18 and he was 22. In the essay, Schuman accuses him of inviting her to hang out with a group of friends at his house in Santa Monica, where he allegedly forced oral sex on her and raped her. At the time, she explains in the essay, she felt she didn\u2019t have the resources to \u201cstand up against my abuser\u2019s legal counsel,\u201d so she chose to stay silent.\n\nOn Wednesday, Schuman voiced her support for her alleged attacker\u2019s brother, calling Aaron\u2019s tweets \u201cbrave.\u201d \u201cOf course I believe and stand with Aaron because I have been in active communication with other Nick Carter survivors!\u201d she tweeted. \u201cHolding their stories, continuing to advocate despite not being supported or believed.\u201d In a tweet seemingly addressed to the media, Schuman wrote, \u201cyou are villainizing the wrong Carter.\u201d\n\nAaron\u2019s online accusations against his brother from the past 24 hours include \u201cstatutory rape\u201d and intimidating girls into silence. In a vague, unpunctuated tweet, he wrote, \u201cRestraining order says stay 100 feet away It\u2019s been thousands of miles for years Using the court system to shake me down Worked on some girls but won\u2019t work on me.\u201d He even goes so far as to call on true crime television host Aphrodite Jones to \u201cdo a r Kelly type documentary\u201d about his brother.\n\nNick Carter has never been charged in connection to sexual assault accusations and denies Schuman\u2019s allegations. The LAPD declined to press charges against him when Schuman reported the alleged assault to the police in 2018, as the statute of limitations had expired. Neither Aaron Carter nor Nick Carter responded to requests for comment.\n\nAaron\u2019s Twitter tirade comes after he opened up on Friday\u2019s episode of The Doctors about his battle with drug addiction and recent diagnoses of multiple personality disorder, schizophrenia, and acute anxiety. He claimed on the show that he hasn\u2019t used opiates since 2017, in spite of testing positive. Next month, Carter will appear alongside fellow child star Corey Feldman on the reality show Marriage Bootcamp: Reality Stars Family Edition.", "description": "The younger Carter claims his Backstreet Boy brother Nick\u2019s restraining order against him is \u201cretaliation\u201d for voicing support for the women who have accused him of rape.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568860474/190917-julian-carter-tease_gdy8eg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
