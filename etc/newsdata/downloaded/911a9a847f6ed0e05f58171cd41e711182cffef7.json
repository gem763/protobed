That\u2019s the equivalent of 53,000 trees, or the annual destruction of Sherwood Forest.\n\nAbout half of receipts are printed on thermal paper which is not recyclable because the ink used contains bisphenol A, a chemical considered toxic to humans.\n\nNot \u00adforgetting the related associated wastage of energy and water used to make them.\n\nCalifornia is considering a \u2018Skip the Slip\u2019 law to make digital receipts the default option from 2022.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just receipts causing a problem.\n\nUsing the most recent statistics from the Civil Aviation Authority, the Office of Rail and Road for rail passenger journeys and the Department of Transport for bus travel, Omio, a travel booking app, \u00adcalculated the environmental impact of paper tickets.\n\nIt found an extra 640,322 trees could be saved each year if travellers on buses, planes and trains were to adopt paperless ticketing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sobering to consider the volume of trees that could be saved annually if all journeys by train, bus and flight were paperless.\n\n\"That\u2019s enough trees to help offset 160,000 tonnes of CO2e(5),\u201d said Chris Hall, director of Omio.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to be cynical about such campaigns, not least when the Beat The Receipt campaign is headed up by the co-founders of Flux, a digital receipts and rewards platform seeking to capitalise on any switch away from paper.\n\nBut there is a benefit to the \u00adenvironment, albeit small, by helping to change behaviour and making consumers and businesses aware\n\nof their footprint.\n\nRetailers for years resisted a plastic bag levy, yet usage has fallen 80% since it was introduced.\n\nEliminating paper receipts would be another step in the right direction.", "description": "Around half of receipts are printed on thermal paper which is not recyclable \u2014 and paperless tickets may be part of the solution", "authors": ["Nada Farhoud", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20571534.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GP32688063.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
