(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer)\n\nMike Leach didn\u2019t have too many kind things to say after his team\u2019s 38-13 loss at Utah late Saturday night.\n\nThe loss was Washington\u2019s second straight. And the Cougars have been outscored 88-27 since they had a 49-17 third quarter lead against UCLA a week ago. Leach said Saturday night that his team wasn\u2019t tough like last season\u2019s team.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say how tough Utah is because they had token resistance on both sides of the ball for us,\u201d Leach said after the game. \u201cAnd we\u2019re a very soft team. We get a lot of good press. We like to read it a lot. We pat ourselves on the back. And if we get any resistance, we fold. And what\u2019s amazing about this is that most of these guys were on the same team last year that was a tough team. Last year\u2019s team was a tough team for us. And we got nearly the same guys. All of the sudden they\u2019re not tough. They\u2019re fat, dumb and happy and entitled.\u201d\n\nThat was just Leach\u2019s opening statement too.\n\nIt can be very tricky when a millionaire coach criticizes the toughness of his players who aren\u2019t making millions of dollars. And Leach did cursorily mention the failures of the coaching staff to allow Washington State to become a team that he believes is soft.\n\n\u201cCoaching-wise, we failed to get through to them,\u201d Leach said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see too much pouting among coaches but collectively starting with me we failed to get through to them. We let them evolve into a soft team. And they are soft.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nBut it\u2019s ultimately Leach and his coaching staff\u2019s responsibility to figure out how to fix the supposed issues of toughness. That\u2019s what they\u2019re paid a lot of good money to do. If Washington State continues to be, in Leach\u2019s words, soft, happy and entitled over the rest of the season, it\u2019s more of a reflection on Leach and the job his coaching staff is doing in 2019 than it is on the players his staff recruited to Pullman.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Leach's team has been outscored 88-27 since leading UCLA 49-17 in the third quarter in Week 4.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aF089eMe9TYuAaskpuiRtQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KvUfYtWje8ApuhMEJKAMOw--~B/aD0zNTk5O3c9NTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8db2b8e0-e2bc-11e9-bbbf-10fca0bee45b", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
