That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday\u2019s third-quarter GDP data.\n\nThe protests, which started over an extradition bill that has now been withdrawn, have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades and pose the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.", "description": "Thousands of Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters, many of whom still wear now-banned face-masks, plan to combine with fancy-dress clubbers on Thursday in the party district of Lan Kwai Fong on a potentially dangerous and rowdy Halloween.", "authors": ["Farah Master", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446466890&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0J2", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
