Schwarzman shares how he built his private equity empire The Blackstone Group (BX) and became one of the most sought-after CEOs for advice from world leaders in his new memoir, \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence\" released on Tuesday.\n\nIn 34 years, Blackstone has evolved from an upstart advisory shop to a global behemoth with $545 billion in assets under management. It's lines of business range from real estate to private equity to hedge funds and credit. Schwarzman, 72, is listed as the 100th richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $18.4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nIn an interview with Yahoo Finance, he acknowledges that he was born at a time where attaining his level of success was easier.\n\n\"I was born in a time where, you know, it was easier than it is today,\" Schwarzman said. \"It was the second year of the post-World War II baby boom. So there weren't many people ahead of you. So, I think I probably could have figured out a route in today's world, but it was definitely easier when I was going to junior high school and high school and college and getting my first job.\"\n\n[See also: Steve Schwarzman sees a 'wake-up call' for investors]\n\nGrowing up in a middle-class family in a Philadelphia suburb, Schwarzman folded handkerchiefs for ten cents an hour at Schwarzman's Curtains and Linens, a dry goods retailer his father inherited from Schwarzman's grandfather. At an early age, he looked for opportunities and suggested that his father expand the business into a nation-wide chain, which his father rejected.\n\nSchwarzman always had big ambitions for his life, but he wasn't sure exactly what he wanted to be. In a job interview, he once described his ideal role as a \"telephone switchboard,\" where he would take information, digest it, and create outputs.\n\nA track star and president of his high school's student council, Schwarzman found leadership roles to be \"always natural.\" That mindset continued for him in college, the Army, business school, and Wall Street.\n\nStephen A.

I sort of always wanted things to work well,\" he said.\n\nAfter being waitlisted at Harvard, Schwarzman went to Yale where he discovered that he was underprepared academically. On campus, his goal was to join the exclusive club Skull and Bones. He garnered the attention of the society's members by making the social scene more lively for the then all-male campus. He brought in ballet performances and successfully lobbied to change the parietal rules that banned women from staying overnight in a dorm room.\n\n$10,500\n\nAfter graduation, he was offered a job in 1969 at the firm Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette paying $10,000 per year. Schwarzman countered with Bill Donaldson demanding $10,500 because he heard that there was another person from Yale making $10,000 and he wanted to be the high-paid person his class. He eventually won.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, he signed up for the Army Reserves and embarked for active-duty training six months after starting at DLJ. At the training, his company underperformed because they were underfed compared to the others. Schwarzman challenged the hierarchy to point out the problem to the colonel. After leaving camp, he went to Harvard Business School, where he became bored and wanted to drop out. There, he also made a point to try to improve the school.\n\nHe joined Lehman Brothers after finishing business school, and that's where his career took flight. In 1978, he advised Tropicana on its sale to Beatrice Foods for $488 million, his first-ever foray into M&A with no experience in the area and a deal he did solo. In just six years, he became the youngest managing director and was leading mergers and acquisitions.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Billionaire Stephen A.
