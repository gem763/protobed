Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nDuring a Tuesday morning interview with WAMC-FM radio\u2019s Alan Chartock, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo took a strange detour from the topic being discussed. \u201cApropos of nothing,\u201d Cuomo said \u2014 neglecting to specify whether he was referring to his own tangent or the New York Times quote he was about to share \u2014 \u201d[Many Americans] used an expression that southern Italians \u2026 were called quote-unquote, and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting the Times, \u2018N\u2014- wops.\u2019 N-word wops, as a derogatory comment.\u201d\n\nCuomo was responding to Chartock\u2019s earlier question about whether he would keep hiding budget shortfalls by delaying Medicaid payments \u201cto push them into the next budget year,\u201d as the Times had reported he was doing. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I don\u2019t even, I don\u2019t understand that fully,\u201d Cuomo said. When Chartock responded, with mild sarcasm, that \u201cif the Times said it\u2019s so it must be so,\u201d Cuomo cited an unrelated Times op-ed published on Saturday titled \u201cHow Italians Became \u2018White.\u2019\u201d The article, written by Brent Staples, charts how Italians in the U.S. went from being a reviled minority to eventual members of the white majority \u2014 a fascinating story, none of which is at all relevant to Cuomo\u2019s budgeting or Medicaid in New York.\n\nCuomo tried to use it as a cudgel against the paper anyway. Here\u2019s the governor\u2019s full quote:\n\nThey used an expression that southern Italians were called, I believe they were saying southern Italians, Sicilians \u2014 I\u2019m half Sicilian \u2014 were called, quote-unquote and pardon my language, but I\u2019m just quoting the Times, \u201cn\u2014- wops.\u201d N-word wops, as a derogatory comment. When I said that wop was a derogatory comment, that when the Times Union told me, no, you should look in Wikipedia, wop really meant dandy. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they were saying to me back in Queens! \u201cYou\u2019re a dandy,\u201d when they looked at me with scorn and they gave me a hand gesture and called me a wop. So that\u2019s the New York Times.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how \u201cthat\u2019s the New York Times\u201d \u2014 implying that the publication has a habit of getting these things wrong \u2014 when the paper Cuomo seems to be accusing of mischaracterizing the word \u201cwop\u201d is actually the Times Union, an entirely different publication. Nor is it clear how Staples\u2019s op-ed has any bearing on Medicaid budget allocations in New York, or why Cuomo\u2019s point couldn\u2019t be illustrated without using several racial slurs. Minutes earlier, he and Chartock had discussed negative stereotypes of Italian Americans and the importance of apologizing for offensive remarks. But that subject had passed well before the governor brought up the Times piece.\n\nOne reading of the exchange is that Cuomo was practicing the timeworn tradition, common among many white Americans, of vivifying accounts of his own hardship by equating it with the historical suffering of black Americans. He has firsthand experience with anti-Italian prejudice, which he endured as a young man in Queens, but the term \u201cn\u2014 wop\u201d was unfamiliar to him. His decision to invoke it here suggests he\u2019s found a newer and striking way to describe the discrimination he\u2019s experienced \u2014 discrimination so bad that it\u2019s comparable to that faced by black people. Recent examples abound of similarly dubious comparisons: Cuomo\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, has described being referred to as \u201cFredo\u201d as \u201clike the \u2018N-word\u2019 for us Italian Americans.\u201d (It isn\u2019t.) Former Maine Governor Paul LePage said being called a racist is \u201clike calling a black man the \u2018N-word.\u2019\u201d (It\u2019s not, and LePage is a racist.)\n\nBut the comparison mostly doesn\u2019t work because the Times op-ed Cuomo is referencing draws the opposite conclusion: Italian Americans may have faced horrific and violent prejudice at one point, but were eventually embraced as essential to the American fabric in ways that black people weren\u2019t. The threat of war with Italy made the continued persecution of its emigrants to the U.S. untenable through the late 19th century, Staples writes. President Benjamin Harrison kept conflict at bay by calling on Congress to pass legislation protecting foreign nationals \u2014 though not black Americans \u2014 from mob violence, like lynchings, and by establishing what later became Columbus Day, which was celebrated this week.\n\nBlack people were afforded no such protections. And the whitening of Italians was made possible by opportunistic contrasts created to separate the two. So perhaps the more likely explanation for Cuomo\u2019s remarks \u2014 given their incongruity with what was being discussed and irrelevance to the subject at hand \u2014 is that he simply wanted an excuse to use a taboo slur. Maybe we\u2019ll never know. Maybe we\u2019re worse off for even bothering to ask. The only certainty is that Governor Cuomo said \u201cn\u2014\u201d on the radio this morning, and nobody seems clear as to why.", "description": "Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, used a racial slur on a radio show while describing a New York Times op-ed about Italians and black people that had nothing to do with what he was discussing.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/06/24/24-andrew-cuomo.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
