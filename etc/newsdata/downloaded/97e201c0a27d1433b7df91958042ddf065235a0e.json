He doesn't actually have a cybersecurity-related degree or certification. He's a firm believer that cyber specialists shouldn't just be technical folk or those with computer science degrees.\n\n\"One of the things at CommBank -- I look after the cyber intel team, who are very focused on making sure that we collect information on what the bad guys on the internet are doing and we share it with our peer institutions, and the rest of the industry, so that everyone can make it as safe as possible,\" he explained.\n\n\"That doesn't require a huge depth of technical skills, it requires skills like social science, critical theory, all those kinds of things ... we're starting to see a need for people all the way along that spectrum and other specialities to overlap with cybersecurity.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The GM of the yellow bank's cybersecurity centre wants the nation to take advantage of its current position, and export cyber talent and innovation to the rest of the world.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/25/e016d370-e69b-4995-b2e2-d4c46794fdc6/thumbnail/770x578/517e1e046d719e40ff3ad7e486be2447/data-protection-and-cyber-security.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
