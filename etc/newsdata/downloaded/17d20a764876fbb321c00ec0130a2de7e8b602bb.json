Of those walking off their jobs in Seattle, most are office workers she said, but they also have some fulfillment center workers joining them as well.\n\nOn Thursday, the day before the planned protest, Bezos announced Amazon's sweeping new commitment to tackle climate change -- committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, announcing the purchase of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles and pledging a $100 million investment in international reforestation projects.\n\nShortly after the Bezos' Climate Pledge was announced Thursday, the group spearheading the protest, Amazon Employees For Climate Justice, put out a statement lauding Bezos' efforts but added that \"we know it's not enough.\"\n\n\"As long as Amazon uses its power to help oil and gas companies discover and extract more fossil fuel, donates to climate-denying politicians and think tanks, and enables the oppression of climate refugees, employees will keep raising our voices,\" the group said in a statement.\n\nThe group said that 1,500 Amazon workers as well as 700 Google workers have pledged to walk out in support of the Global Climate Strike.\n\nLisa Werner/Moment Editorial/Getty Images\n\nA keystone of Bezos' and Amazon's \"Climate Pledge\" is meeting the tenets lined out in the international Paris Agreement ten years ahead of schedule.\n\n\u201cAs one of the country\u2019s that's very highly-polluting, we need to do even more than what the Paris Agreement is asking for, and that\u2019s why today we\u2019re still walking out,\u201d Naidu said, adding that they hope to see zero emissions \u201cnot net-zero\u201d and want Amazon to \u201cstop funding the fossil fuel companies.\u201d\n\nIn their statement, Amazon Employees For Climate Justice workers are reiterating the company \"still has work to do.\"\n\n\"The Paris Agreement was a political agreement, not a scientific one,\" the statement said, calling \"historically high-polluting countries to look beyond the Paris Agreement, because meeting its targets, even 10 years ahead of schedule, does not, by itself, put us on a pathway to a livable planet.\"\n\nLet\u2019s continue to follow the leadership and moral clarity of young people like @GretaThunberg. We can\u2019t put it better than she does: \u201cActivism works.
