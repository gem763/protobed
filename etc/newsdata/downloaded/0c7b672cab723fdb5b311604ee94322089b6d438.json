They pointed to his saying that the U.S. knew of al-Baghdadi\u2019s whereabouts via technology, and also knew of the underground tunnels at his compound, which suggests the U.S. has infrared abilities to locate caves and tunnels\u2026\n\nOther information Trump discussed provided America\u2019s enemies with tactical details on how the military carries out a raid like the one on al-Baghdadi, officials said, including the robot, the helicopter flight patterns and how U.S. forces entered the compound.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbc News", "Nbcnews.Com News World"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
