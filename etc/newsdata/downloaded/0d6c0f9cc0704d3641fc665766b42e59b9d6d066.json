Tsang was among seven people charged Thursday with rioting, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison. He also faces two additional counts of attacking two police officers, punishable by up to six months in prison.\n\nThe protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing's interference in Hong Kong's autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. More than 1750 people have been detained so far.\n\nPolice associations and some pro-Beijing groups have called for tougher measures.\n\nThe Junior Police Officers Association, representing front-line officers, said the force has been stretched thin. It has urged the government to impose a curfew and other emergency measures to maintain public order.\n\nA pro-government group, including lawmakers and lawyers, said Thursday that authorities should use the example of a Canadian law that imposes a jail sentence of up to 10 years on anyone wearing a mask during a riot or unlawful assembly.\n\nLawmaker Elizabeth Quat said the ban would specifically target rioters and wouldn't curb citizens' freedom of assembly. While it wouldn't bring protests to a halt, she said it would help reduce the violence that has wracked the territory.\n\nBut Ip Kin-yuen, a legislator representing the education sector, warned it would be akin to \"adding oil to the fire\" and could further weaken the government in dealing with the crisis.\n\nLegislator Tien said protesters could challenge a mask ban and any curfew order, just as tens of thousands of people have defied police bans on rallies and taken to the streets in the past months.\n\nBut he said it could work if the government also responds to at least the key demand of the protesters, which is to hold an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.\n\n\"They need to use carrot and stick at the same time,\" Tien said.\n\nAAP", "description": "Police say they have been stretched too thin as protests continue and believe a mask ban could deter rioters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2269%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3b4baa6022821be88cea96f8948446733f62e863", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
