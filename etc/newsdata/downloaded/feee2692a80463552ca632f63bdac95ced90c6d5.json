Leaving Syria puts multiple US interests at risk. He\u2019s not putting an end to \u201cendless wars,\u201d he\u2019s planting the seeds for future ones.\n\nFor starters, Trump made the abrupt call to abandon US-allied Kurdish fighters and give Turkey the responsibility for captured ISIS fighters after a weekend call with Turkish tyrant Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who\u2019s about as unreliable an \u201cally\u201d as it gets.\n\nsee also President Trump shakes off GOP criticism of Syria pullout President Trump on Monday defended his decision to bring back...\n\nErdogan is responsible for letting many of those ISIS fighters enter Syria in the first place: An Islamist himself, he has long played both sides of nearly every conflict in the region. His only loyalty is to his own power.\n\nTrump says he\u2019ll use US economic power to hold Erdogan responsible for not letting thousands of now-captive ISIS killers escape, but that\u2019s far from a guarantee that Turkish forces can prevent it. This invasion thus risks the revival of one of the most savage terrorist groups the world has ever known.\n\nRenewed war \u2014 and the prospect of a long-term Turkish occupation of Syrian territory \u2014 is also likely to further destabilize the region.\n\nBut most importantly, we have betrayed the Kurds.\n\nThe Kurds have served as our allies in Iraq and Syria, and did much of the dirty work of putting ISIS down. Yet Erdogan views the Kurds as terrorists, and fears the Kurdish dream of an independent state. Erdogan\u2019s troops will slaughter as many as they can.\n\nThe next group that Washington approaches to provide \u201cboots on the ground\u201d in some similar campaign \u2014 in the Middle East or anywhere else \u2014 will take note of how we treat our friends.\n\nThe president is right that it\u2019s not America\u2019s job to solve all the problems of the Middle East, but giving a green light to Erdogan\u2019s invasion is all too likely to mean trouble down the road for the United States.", "description": "For starters, Trump made the abrupt call to abandon US-allied Kurdish fighters and give Turkey the responsibility for captured ISIS fighters after a weekend call with Turkish tyrant Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who\u2019s about as unreliable an \u201cally\u201d as it gets.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/afp_1l76nc.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
