That all changed this week.\n\nOn Monday, the Solomon Islands -- one of the biggest economies in the region -- recognized China and ended formal relations with Taiwan that began in 1983. Kiribati followed suit in news that broke on Friday. Before the defections, Taiwan hadn\u2019t lost a friend in the region since 2004.\n\nTaiwan now has just 15 diplomatic partners worldwide, including four in the Pacific. At least two of those relationships are also looking shaky, as China\u2019s spending spree of $1.6 billion in aid and loans to the region since 2011 -- more than four times the amount Taiwan has been able to contribute -- has outmatched the democratically-run island.\n\n\u201cThe defections show that Taiwan has hit the ceiling on how much it\u2019s willing to pay to keep its allies in the Pacific,\u201d said Jonathan Pryke, who researches the Pacific Islands at Sydney-based think tank the Lowy Institute. \u201cUltimately for these countries, it\u2019s an economic decision, not a foreign policy one. But for China the main game here is the marginalization of Taiwan, and it also solidifies its presence in the region.\u201d\n\nChina Claims Diplomatic Coup Over Taiwan With Solomon Switch\n\nThat footprint is a growing concern for the U.S. and its close ally Australia. Diplomats in Washington and Canberra fear that China\u2019s end-game in the Pacific Islands may be to establish a naval base that would greatly enhance its military reach toward the Americas.\n\nChina said it \u201chighly\u201d appreciated and supported Kiribati\u2019s decision, and that the move would bring \u201cunprecedented opportunities\u201d to the country.\n\n\u201cIn the past few days the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, both Pacific island countries, have decided to recognize the \u2018one-China\u2019 principle, sever ties with Taiwan and resume or establish relations with China. It is further testament that the \u2018one-China\u2019 principle is the overriding trend recognized by all,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\n\n\u201cRelations between China and Pacific island countries are enjoying rapid development,\u201d he said.\n\nLuring Allies\n\nWhile Beijing and U.S.-backed Taipei have competed for diplomatic recognition since 1949, the battle has intensified in recent years. Since Tsai was elected in January 2016, China has lured away a third of her 22 allies.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s main goal is to squeeze Taiwan\u2019s space in the international arena,\u201d Taiwan Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu told a briefing on Friday. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to wipe out Taiwan\u2019s sovereignty all together.\u201d\n\nEl Salvador cut ties with Taipei last August, months after Burkina Faso and the Dominican Republic switched recognition to Beijing. This week\u2019s defection of the Solomon Islands is perhaps the most important flip, as it means China has reduced Taiwan\u2019s formal diplomatic footprint by almost half in terms of population and economic output since Tsai came to power.\n\nChina has gained an advantage in the region by funding and building much-desired transport and utility infrastructure, compared with the focus by U.S. and Australia on bolstering governance, health and education services. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to discuss Beijing\u2019s growing sway in the South Pacific during face-to-face talks with President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday.\n\nChina\u2019s Pacific Ambitions Loom Over Trump Talks With Aussie PM\n\nThe U.S. recently established a Directorate of Pacific Affairs within the White House National Security Council, which provides a hub for coordinating U.S. policy in the region with other like-minded countries, including Australia. Australia unveiled a A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) infrastructure fund for the region last last year, while the U.S. joined a group that includes Japan, the European Union and the Asian Development Bank to fund projects.\n\n\u201cThese changes are designed to focus inter-agency and international policy on the challenges posed by China\u2019s growing strategic footprint and influence in the South Pacific,\u201d said Ashley Townshend, director of the foreign policy and defense program at the University of Sydney\u2019s United States Studies Centre. \u201cAustralia and the U.S. have, until recently, been asleep at the wheel when it comes to what\u2019s been happening in the region.\u201d", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- For Taiwan, the Pacific Islands had been relatively stable as China siphoned off diplomatic partners elsewhere after independence-leaning President Tsai Ing-wen took power in 2016.
