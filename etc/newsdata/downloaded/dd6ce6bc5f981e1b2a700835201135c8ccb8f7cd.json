Within our system, we\u2019re talking about billions of data points \u2014 clean, analytics-ready data points,\u201d RS Energy Group co-CEO Manuj Nikhanj told the Financial Post.\n\nNikhanj and co-CEO James Jarrell have built a company focused on data acquisition, analytics, software offerings and research in Calgary, where it has bucked the recessionary pressures in the city and grown massively from a 42-person operation in 2015 to a 350-person research and technology company today.\n\n\u201cTwo thirds of our team is focused on data and technology,\u201d Nikhanj said, adding that in a city best known for drilling engineers and geologists, he has no problem hiring computer programmers and software engineers. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised at how deep the bench is here and we\u2019ll continue to hire and we\u2019ll continue to build out here because the skillsets are pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, while the company initially viewed Calgary as a difficult place to grow a high-tech team, the two CEOs now believes it\u2019s an advantage. \u201cOur attrition rate \u2013 I don\u2019t want to jinx it \u2014 has been very low and that\u2019s not the case in places like Austin, Texas or Silicon Valley,\u201d Jarrell said.\n\nTrue to form as a technology company, RS Energy Group\u2019s headquarters is an open office adorned with ping pong tables, snack bars and high-end couches rather than rows upon rows of cubicles, which is more typical in the heart of Calgary\u2019s oilpatch.\n\nOriginally founded in 1998 by two Peters & Co. investment bankers, the firm spent the first 16 years of its corporate life delivering oil-and-gas focused research reports to major institutional investors such as BlackRock Inc. and OppenheimerFunds.\n\nThe company still publishes research reports but in December 2015 New York-based private equity giant Warburg Pincus bought the firm with the aim of creating an energy research platform built on the latest technologies.\n\nIn the years that followed, the team developed tools to collect data on oil and gas production in various North American plays and a software platform to easily visualize and analyze that data. More recently, the company has added artificial intelligence and predictive software to its offerings, allowing producers to use those tools to analyze its data.\n\nJarrell said the company realized engineers and geologists at oil and gas producing companies were spending an inordinate amount of time collecting and cleaning data. Now, with RS Energy\u2019s Prism software platform, the data collection and cleaning is done for them, freeing up those same engineers and geologists to spend more time analyzing the numbers.\n\nBut, when asked how quickly oil and gas producers are adopting the software, Jarrell, Nikhanj and David Howard, the firm\u2019s executive director and co-head of research and advisory, pause.\n\n\u201cThe trend is accelerating,\u201d Howard said, though he notes that oil and gas companies have historically been slow to adopt new software and new technology.\n\nThat could be beginning to change, however, as a recent survey from accounting giant Ernst & Young Global Ltd. found that 89 per cent of the world\u2019s oil and gas companies plan to spend more on technology in the coming year.\n\n\u201cWe have been a little slower in the Canadian context to deploy new technologies,\u201d EY oil and gas leader Lance Mortlock said, making Canadian oil and gas producers particularly slow adopters in a slow-adopting industry. He noted, however, that there are pressures on Canadian oil producers to adopt technology more quickly to reduce costs.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important now because of the challenges that we\u2019re under with market access issues, regulatory issues, cost issues, differentials \u2014 all of these things. There\u2019s just a far greater emphasis in the last five years since the downturn started in managing efficiencies,\u201d Mortlock said.\n\nThe energy companies have learned they\u2019re not software companies James Jarrell, RS Energy co-CEO\n\nSimilarly, Jarrell said his energy clients in Calgary and Houston have been focused on trimming costs wherever possible and don\u2019t have excess cash to spend on building software programs of their own. \u201cThe energy companies have learned they\u2019re not software companies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is also adding more and more oil and gas producers as clients. In 2015, Jarrell said, 90 per cent of RS Energy Group\u2019s clients were institutional investors looking for better research on the energy sector. Today, 60 per cent of the company\u2019s clients are oil and gas companies and he said the proportion is continuing to grow with its technology.\n\n\u201cWe have some clients that have 500 users (of RS Energy\u2019s platform) across their organization,\u201d Nikhanj said, adding that younger employees at major oil producers are driving wider adoption of new technology. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see a changing of the guard a little bit. They\u2019re really hungry to start leveraging technology.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "Nikhanj and co-CEO James Jarrell have built a company that has bucked the recessionary pressures in the city", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/rsenergy1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
