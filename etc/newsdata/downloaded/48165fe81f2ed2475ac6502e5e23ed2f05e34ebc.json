The actress, who plays the \u201cmoral compass\u201d in the upcoming Jojo Rabbit film, has previously worked with Allen in Match Point, Scoop, and Vicky Cristina Barcelona and revealed that she\u2019d love to be in another of his films. \u201cHow do I feel about Woody Allen?\u201d she asked. \u201cI love Woody. I believe him, and I would work with him anytime.\u201d It\u2019s an unpopular opinion, as other Allen collaborators, like Greta Gerwig, continue to distance themselves from the director. In the past, Johansson has demurred when asked about the controversy surrounding the director, telling The Guardian in 2014 that she was \u201cunaware that there\u2019s been a backlash.\u201d But this time, she pulled no punches. \u201cI see Woody whenever I can, and I have had a lot of conversations with him about it,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have been very direct with him, and he\u2019s very direct with me. He maintains his innocence, and I believe him.\u201d\n\nThroughout the #MeToo movement, Woody Allen has face renewed scrutiny, as sexual-molestation accusations made against him by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow reemerged. Actors distanced themselves from him and Amazon returned the rights to his latest film, A Rainy Day in New York. The film\u2019s stars Selena Gomez, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries. (The film was picked up by Italian distributor Lucky Red and will be shown in theaters across Europe.) As the culture shifts to believing victims, Johansson finds her situation difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because it\u2019s a time where people are very fired up, and understandably,\u201d she said. \u201cThings needed to be stirred up, and so people have a lot of passion and a lot of strong feelings and are angry, and rightfully so. It\u2019s an intense time.\u201d", "description": "Scarlett Johansson spoke to \u201cThe Hollywood Reporter\u201d about her relationship with controversial director Woody Allen.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/04/04-scarlet-johannsen.w1200.h630.jpg"}
