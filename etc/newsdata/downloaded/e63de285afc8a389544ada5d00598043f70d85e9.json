And value stocks have been on an incredible run over the last month. They\u2019ve outperformed growth stocks by 9%, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ).\n\nThis isn\u2019t normal. Value stocks haven\u2019t outpaced growth stocks by this wide of a margin since 2010. And this is probably just the start.\n\nOnce they break ahead like this, value stocks usually outperform growth stocks for another nine months. This pattern has held up around 75% of the time since 1986.\n\nThose are pretty good odds, making now the perfect time to load up on value stocks. Three in particular:\n\nValue Stocks Set to Surge\n\nWhen investors talk about \u201cvalue stocks,\u201d they mean stocks with strong fundamentals that are relatively cheap. A lot of these stocks also pay high dividends.\n\nValue stocks have shot up 236% since the lows of the financial crisis in February 2009. At the same time, growth stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google\u2019s parent company), and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) have soared 387%.\n\nGrowth Vs. Value Stocks\n\nGrowth stocks have had an amazing run. But they\u2019re also very expensive right now.\n\nOne way to measure how expensive they are compared to value stocks is to divide the Russell 1000 Growth Index by the Russell 1000 Value Index.\n\nAccording to this widely used measure, growth stocks haven\u2019t been this expensive since the height of the dot-com bubble in 2001:\n\nGrowth:Value Ratio\n\nIn case you forgot what happened next, the growth-stock-heavy fell 78% when the dot-com bubble burst:\n\nNasdaq Composite\n\nI don\u2019t expect a dot-com-style crash any time soon. But I do expect growth stocks to pull back over the next 12 months. Value stocks, however, should continue to rise, making now a good time to load up on them.\n\nRecord-Low Interest Rates Are Key\n\nAll told, US stocks have risen nearly 200% over the past decade. This is the longest bull market in US history, as I\u2019ve mentioned before.\n\nWhen a bull market gets long in the tooth, investors start selling their growth stocks and buying value stocks.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Hugo Rogers, who manages a $5 billion fund at Deltec International Group, is doing. He sees the recent shift to value as a long-term reversal that will last for many years.\n\nIt all comes back to interest rates. Many analysts think central banks can\u2019t lower interest rates much further. And for good reason.\n\nThe world\u2019s five largest central banks all lowered rates at their last policy meetings.\n\nCentral Bank Rates\n\nRates in Europe and Japan are already at historic lows. And the Fed has been coy about whether it will continue to cut rates over the long term.\n\nLow interest rates fuel stock prices, particularly for growth stocks that depend on easy money. If the cheap money dries up, many investors will dump growth stocks and pour money into safe and reliable value stocks.\n\nThree Value Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRemember: Value stocks should continue to outperform growth stocks for the next nine months or so.\n\nThis shift should boost defensive stocks in particular, according to investment bank UBS. Think consumer staples, telecom, and utilities.\n\nMy top consumer staples company is Procter & Gamble (PG). You probably have some of its products in your house right now. Maybe Crest toothpaste, Dawn dish soap, or Bounty paper towels.\n\nConsumer staples are boring. But boring is good. These companies keep making money, day in and day out.\n\nP&G is also a Dividend Aristocrat, meaning it\u2019s raised its dividend at least 25 years in a row. So its 2.4% dividend yield is very safe.\n\nI\u2019m also a big fan of telecom giant AT&T (T). The company is the second-largest wireless carrier in the US. One in three Americans use AT&T. So there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re using its data network to read this article.\n\nThe Dividend Aristocrat pays a safe 5.5% dividend yield. It\u2019s also the first US provider to offer 5G capability.\n\nFinally, you should consider buying shares of retail giant Walmart (WMT). It\u2019s the largest physical retailer in the US. And it\u2019s nipping at Amazon\u2019s heels in the e-commerce space.\n\nWalmart is another Dividend Aristocrat. It pays a safe and reliable 1.8% dividend yield.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Robert Ross covering: Bank of America Corp, Alphabet Inc Class A, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc.
