We had a long discussion about it but finally, I think it is a good decision that KTM made,\" said KTM team manager Mike Leitner.\n\n\"In Pol, we have a very strong rider who has made good results for us and we've seen in the other categories what Brad is capable of with our bikes.\n\n\"He is one of the young kids that has come through the ranks. It will be a big challenge for him but I think he will have a great future in MotoGP.\"\n\nLecuona, 19, had already signed a deal for 2020 to ride for the Ajo Motorsport-run KTM Moto2 factory squad, although KTM then announced it was ceasing its intermediate-class programme.\n\nA Moto2 regular since mid-2016, Lecuona scored his maiden podium in last year's Valencia finale and is 11th in the current championship standings.\n\nLecuona is the second-highest placed KTM rider in the category behind Binder.\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "KTM has named Brad Binder as Johann Zarco's replacement in its factory MotoGP team in 2020 and will line-up alongside existing rider Pol Espargaro", "authors": ["Valentin Khorounzhiy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gbvEbUwqmFIg0xVdbJaE8g--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/1eeebbfe04b74470a6a14243b67cbcd1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
