Both parties could struggle to form a majority coalition with smaller allies, though, forcing them into a potential unity government.\n\nIt's the second election this year, after Netanyahu failed to build a coalition following April's vote and dissolved parliament.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7 a.m. Tuesday with exit polls expected at the end of the voting day at 10 p.m. Official results are projected to come in overnight.", "description": "JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Israelis have begun voting in an unprecedented repeat election that will decide whether longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power.", "authors": ["Aron Heller", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
