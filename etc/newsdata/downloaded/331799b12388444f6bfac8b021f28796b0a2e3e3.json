It\u2019s what dragged Ricky Hatton back from a destructive vortex of drink, drugs and the unshakeable urge to kill himself.\n\nIt\u2019s what will offer a window into his recovery when he lights up a hall in Dundee next month with the stories, laughter and often brutal honesty that now exist, once again, most of the time, in its place.\n\nTalking helps people. It is the message Hatton sends out regularly in his role as a mental health ambassador and a reason why he feels compelled to reach out to Josh Taylor and offer the benefit of his experience in and out of the ring. If Taylor wants it, that is.\n\nTalking is what dragged Ricky Hatton back from a destructive vortex of drink and drugs\n\nThe former two-weight world champion sees strong parallels between his rise to the top of the hurt business and the 28-year-old Scot\u2019s current ascent through the ranks.\n\nLike Taylor, his first world title came in the form of the IBF super-lightweight belt and he took the WBA version on his very next outing \u2014 as Taylor will attempt to do in his unification match with American Regis Prograis in London on October 26.\n\nLike Taylor, he always intended to rule more than one division. Hatton reigned at welterweight for a time with the Glasgow 2014 gold medallist\u2019s post-Prograis plan based around taking out WBC and WBO rival Jose Ramirez before moving up to 147lbs, where big names Manny Pacquiao, Errol Spence Jr and Terence Crawford currently hold the titles.\n\nHatton boxed five times in the States at his peak, packing out the MGM Grand in Las Vegas for superfights in both weight categories with Floyd Mayweather Jr and Pacquiao.\n\nHatton feels compelled to reach out to Josh Taylor and offer the benefit of his experience\n\nHe believes victory over Prograis will also crack open the top end of the American market for Taylor \u2014 and would be delighted to help the southpaw from the East Lothian town of Prestonpans take full advantage.\n\n\u2018Josh is in a very similar position to the one I was in,\u2019 reasoned Hatton. \u2018I went straight into a unification match with WBA champ Carlos Maussa after winning the IBF title from Kostya Tszyu.\n\n\u2018This is a dangerous fight for Josh, but Prograis is a little bit unknown to most, isn\u2019t he? Josh will want to be in with big names, but those opportunities will open up if he wins.\n\n\u2018Not many fighters have won unification bouts with a Ring Magazine belt also on the line, so beating Prograis will definitely take Josh into an elite group. What is exciting for him is what comes next.\n\n\u2018From the moment I became a world champion in front of big home crowds in Manchester, my dream became seeing my name in lights on The Strip in Vegas.\n\n\u2018Sure, you want paydays to secure your family\u2019s future, but Josh is now at a level where I am sure that not seeing his name up in lights at Madison Square Garden or Vegas would be a disappointment given the talent he\u2019s got. If and when he does go fighting in the States, my phone will always be open for him for any advice.\u2019\n\nRicky Hatton during a public workout at Old Spitalfields Market in July earlier this year\n\nA call will certainly put Taylor in esteemed company. Hatton served as a cornerman when Tyson Fury was thwarted by a controversial draw in his world heavyweight clash with Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles last December and helped design Fury\u2019s schedule for his Las Vegas bouts with Tom Schwarz and Otto Wallin this year.\n\nTaylor has, of course, fought in Vegas \u2014 winning his eighth pro-contest against Alfonso Olvera on the undercard of Carl Frampton\u2019s WBA super-feather loss to Leo Santa Cruz in 2017 \u2014 and boxed in El Paso and Brooklyn even earlier in his short yet eventful 15-bout career.\n\nHatton\u2019s initial pointers for lighting up those big nights in Sin City revolve around practicalities such as refusing to stay in the casino staging the fight because the air-conditioning will block your nose and arriving early to deal with the altitude.\n\nHatton learned all this the hard way when turning up ten days before his world title contest with Colombian Juan Urango in 2007 and, despite taking a points decision, feeling bushed after five rounds.\n\n\u2018All sorts of things make the difference between winning and losing,\u2019 he recalled.\n\nYet, it is in coming to terms with losing at the highest level \u2014 or, rather, failing to come to terms with it \u2014 where this frank, engaging 41-year-old can offer Taylor perhaps the most revealing of insights.\n\nHatton was overcome by depression after losing his 43-fight unbeaten record to an 11th round TKO at the hands of Mayweather in their 2007 fight for the WBC welterweight title. He felt he\u2019d let people down, struggled to leave the house and used alcohol as a crutch.\n\nWhen Pacquiao knocked him out in two rounds back in the MGM Grand 18 months later, though, the darkness consumed him completely.\n\nRicky Hatton, whilst the trainer of Nathan Gorman, looks on as Gorman fights Sean Turner\n\nWild living spiralled. Hatton regularly contemplated suicide, holding a knife to his wrists. It was only when being exposed for using cocaine that he checked into rehab.\n\nTalking about the mental health issues behind his behaviour was the first step back. Learning to put his defeats \u2014 to two of boxing\u2019s modern greats, remember \u2014 into perspective has been another.\n\n\u2018I used to look back on those fights with such disappointment and they drove me insane for a short while, which has been well documented,\u2019 confessed Hatton.\n\n\u2018But, now, I look back upon them with massive pride and it would be nice for Josh to be involved in contests of that nature \u2014 if only to sit as an old man on the settee with his grandkids round him and reflect. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\n\n\u2018At the time, I was embarrassed at being destroyed by Pacquiao and didn\u2019t want to show my face, but time is a great healer. Until my comeback fight in 2012, two of the greatest in history were the only two to beat me.\n\n\u2018My youngest daughter is eight and only just starting to realise what I did. She\u2019ll see my belts in my games room and little videos on YouTube and say: \u201cOh, my gosh, was that you, daddy?\u201d That\u2019s like winning a world title, in itself.\n\n\u2018Around 40,000 people went to the Mayweather fight. I don\u2019t think that will ever happen again. \u2018In hindsight, I put that down as one of my greatest achievements. When I go to Vegas now, the American public still know me.\n\nHatton (left) was part of Fury's background staff when the British boxer fought Deontay Wilder\n\n\u2018If they like your style \u2014 and they can\u2019t help but like Josh\u2019s style \u2014 your name is cemented there forever.\u2019\n\nLearning not to get carried away with your own legend, however, should be considered another essential survival technique when surrounded by such adulation.\n\nAmid the madness and money of big-time boxing, Hatton became estranged from his parents Carol and Ray, also his former manager, after a row and fell out with trainer Billy Graham.\n\nThose relationships appear to have been healing recently, but Hatton concedes life within the whirlwind of the superfight culture can be impossible to control.\n\n\u2018It is very hard keeping your feet on the floor and not believing the hype,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018The interest in these big, big fights is on a different plane.\n\n\u2018For the Mayweather fight, I did the 24/7 behind-the-scenes documentary leading up to it. I think I took the bait a bit with the cameras around all the time.\n\n\u2018I probably got too wound-up in the promotional thing, in the press conferences when Floyd was getting in your face to sell the fight.\n\n\u2018I got a bit annoyed at times and you have to make sure that whatever is going on \u2014 whether financial things or media \u2014 you don\u2019t take your eyes off the boxing.\n\nHe has been open about struggles with mental health following defeat by Floyd Mayweather\n\n\u2018That\u2019s what got you there in the first place. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\n\nAll this and more will keep a room entranced when Hatton brings his after-dinner roadshow to Tayside. In addition to training fighters at his gym in Hyde, near Manchester, you sense remaining connected to the public serves as another form of therapy for this undoubted man of the people.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always considered myself an entertainer,\u2019 said Hatton. \u2018There was nothing I liked more after winning fights than looking at the crowd and seeing how happy I made people.\n\n\u2018Now, at these sportsman\u2019s dinners, I see people rolling about p*****g themselves after I\u2019ve cracked a joke and it gives me that little buzz.\n\n\u2018As well as having a drink and a laugh, I tell people about the dark side of my life and how I came out the other end.\n\n\u2018I like to think it can maybe help others.\u2019\n\nA sportsman's dinner with Ricky Hatton will take place at City Quay in Dundee on November 1.
