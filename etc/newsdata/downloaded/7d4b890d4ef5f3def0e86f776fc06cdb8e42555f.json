Since the revolution \u2014 which forced Ben Ali to flee the country \u2014 Tunisians have been suffering from a litany of economic woes, from rising food prices to high unemployment to lack of opportunities for a burgeoning youth population. Security concerns have grown as well, with both the Islamic State and al-Qaeda building footholds in the nation.\n\nDisillusionment drove Tunisians to abandon established politicians in last month\u2019s presidential elections. The top two vote-getters \u2014 Nabil Karoui, a media mogul who has campaigned from jail, and Kais Saied, a once-obscure law professor \u2014 will compete in this Sunday\u2019s runoff elections.\n\nBut whoever prevails, Tunisia could be in for more uncertainty. Preliminary results show that Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party, gained the most seats in parliamentary elections last Sunday, setting the stage for the kind of coalition politics that have yet to deliver for Tunisia.\n\nIf Saied wins the presidential race, he will be hard-pressed to gain lawmakers\u2019 support since he is not affiliated with any political party. If Karoui wins, it\u2019s questionable whether he can even take office. In August, he was imprisoned on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, accusations his campaign says are politically motivated. An appeals court ordered his release on Wednesday, but the charges have not been dropped.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat threatens to extend the political inertia and drive more Tunisians from all walks of life to view their country through the prism of Ben Ali.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse economically,\u201d said Ziad Selma, 33, seated in a cafe on Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the epicenter of the 2011 revolts. \u201cA lot of people regret Ben Ali\u2019s departure. We can\u2019t benefit from democracy if we don\u2019t have a good economy.\u201d\n\nOther Arab countries have also seen nostalgia for past autocrats. In neighboring war-riven Libya, large segments of the population wish Moammar Gaddafi had never been ousted. In Egypt, there is nostalgia for Hosni Mubarak because the policies of the current president, Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, have deepened poverty and increased oppression. And in Yemen, the late Ali Abdullah Saleh had millions of followers even after he was forced out of power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut Tunisia emerged from the Arab Spring with a unique standing. In a region where elections are often rigged and civil strife is common, Tunisia has held credible, peaceful and fair elections four times since 2011 \u2014 twice each for the presidency and the parliament.\n\nLast month\u2019s presidential elections came less than two months after the death of 92-year-old President Beji Caid Essebsi, who was elected in 2014. More than two dozen candidates competed to succeed him.\n\nEven as political transparency, free elections and freedom of the press have taken root, vestiges of the former regime remain. Many politicians in government positions, including Essebsi, held significant posts during Ben Ali\u2019s rule. The police, notoriously used by Ben Ali to monitor the population, are still a powerful security apparatus with little oversight, analysts say. A group of wealthy loyalist families, widely seen as corrupt, controlled the economy under Ben Ali and continues to do so today.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome repressive laws from the Ben Ali era have remained in the books, including the infamous \u201cLaw 52\u201d that sentences anyone consuming any quantity of narcotics \u2014 including one marijuana joint \u2014 to a mandatory year in prison.\n\nTunisia\u2019s Truth and Dignity Commission, a body that has documented vast human rights violations and corruption under Ben Ali, has been obstructed by ex-regime figures in the government, police and business community, activists and human rights groups say. That has allowed alleged perpetrators to go unpunished.\n\n\u201cIf we take an expansive perspective of democracy that includes individual rights and freedoms and economic equality,\u201d said Amri, \u201cthe endurance of the repressive state apparatus, of economic inequalities and corruption are creating bigger gaps in Tunisian society today.\u201d\n\nMost Tunisians have not forgotten the Ben Ali regime\u2019s human rights abuses, corruption and marginalization of Tunisians outside of the coastal elite.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmong many Tunisians, the nostalgia for Ben Ali\u2019s regime \u201cis counterbalanced by a greater sense that Ben Ali was a corrupt leader who oversaw the torture and imprisonment of his people and got away easy by living out his life in exile in Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Sarah Yerkes, a Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nBut for many others, it is the disappointed expectations of the revolution that figure most prominently.\n\nUnemployment stands at 15 percent; it\u2019s 36 percent for Tunisians under 24 years of age. Living standards have fallen amid cuts in government spending ordered by the International Monetary Fund. Across the country, protests have erupted over the anemic economy and lack of opportunities.\n\nAD\n\nUnder Ben Ali, Islamist groups were banned. After the revolution, new freedoms flourished, allowing both moderate and radical Islamists to gain influence. Since 2015, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks in Tunisia.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a lot of things that we didn\u2019t face before the revolution,\u201d said Leila Benbelga, the 20-something owner of translation services company. \u201cSo when that happens you say, \u2018Okay, we didn\u2019t like Ben Ali back then. And we wanted a revolution. But we didn\u2019t expect any of this.\u2019 We needed to see a better outcome.\u201d\n\nSassi, the photo shop employee, agreed. Under Ben Ali, he said he received a government pension of 350 Tunisian dinars, or roughly $122 a month. Today, he gets 250 dinars, or $87.50.\n\n\u201cBen Ali never touched the middle class,\u201d said Sassi.\u201d We were doing well under him. Now, even within families we are divided.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "With the economy in crisis, there is nostalgia among some Tunisians for Ben Ali\u2019s regime.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-bbq2hqVu1iEISBGyWm5rRrmfW8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M4DSWUXLRUI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
