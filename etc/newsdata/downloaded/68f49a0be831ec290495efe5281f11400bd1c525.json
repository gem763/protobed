The assault continued in the second half, with the only suspense being if the Terrapins would break the school record for points in game - 80 against Washington College in 1927.\n\nMaryland\u2019s third-stringers had a first and goal at the 4 in the closing minutes but couldn\u2019t push the ball in.\n\nLocksley didn\u2019t care. After taking advantage of Howard\u2019s porous pass defense in the first half, he had his two backup quarterbacks throw only three passes over the final 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision at halftime that we were going to run the ball, even though they outnumbered us,\u201d said Locksley, who took over at Maryland after serving as Alabama offensive coordinator.\n\nIf there was any question about piling it on, Howard first-year coach Ron Prince exonerated Locksley during their brief postgame chat.\n\n\u201cHe understood that we weren\u2019t trying to run the score up. We have respect for how the game should be played,\u201d Locksley said.\n\nOn this day, the Terrapins played it extremely well. They finished with a 623-68 advantage in total yardage, limiting Howard to 1 yard on the ground and four first downs.\n\nMost of the highlights on offense were provided by Jackson, who came to Maryland after an injury-shortened sophomore season at Virginia Tech. He was uncertain how the layoff would affect him, although he needn\u2019t have worried - Jackson went 15 for 24 for 245 yards with TD throws of 26, 4, 6 and 24 yards.\n\nThe last Maryland quarterback to throw four touchdown passes in his first start was Mark Manges, against Villanova in 1975.\n\n\u201cIt was nice. I kind of just got right back into the groove of things,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe touchdowns are cool and everything, but I was just glad we could go out and get a victory in the first game and now we did it. Seventy-nine points is pretty awesome for coach Locks and our team.\u201d\n\nBackup Tyrrell Pigrome threw a 62-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter and ran for a 22-yard score to make it 63-0.\n\nMaryland kept on coming with its backups, but Prince understood.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s my job to stop Maryland. Not Maryland\u2019s job,\u201d Prince said. \u201cI thought coach Locksley was very sporting about the entire thing.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins\u2019 defense also shined, limiting Howard to one first down before halftime while bottling up quarterback Caylin Newton, little brother of NFL star Cam Newton.\n\nNewton went 3 for 11 for 23 yards, was sacked five times and did not play in the second half.\n\nPunting was also a problem. Isaiah Moore had kicks of 14 and 3 yards, dropped the snap once and had a kick blocked for a safety.\n\nThis certainly wasn\u2019t what Prince was looking for in his first game as Howard\u2019s coach. He can console himself in knowing that competing against teams in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference can\u2019t possibly be as difficult as taking on a Big Ten school on its home turf.\n\n\u201cWe knew Maryland was going to be a challenge. They have a fantastic roster,\u201d Prince said. \u201cThey\u2019re a big, strong team and they\u2019re going to be better.\u201d\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nHoward: It\u2019s not a stretch to say Prince has a heck of a lot of work to do if Howard is to be competitive in the MEAC. Offense, defense and special teams were all sub-par. At least the Bison will take away a nice check for driving down the road to play against a neighboring giant.\n\nMaryland: Well, it\u2019s tough to top this performance in terms of getting off to a strong start under a new coach, though it would be foolish to measure Maryland\u2019s strength or improvement based on this awful mismatch.\n\nSTARTING STRONG\n\nMaryland has won 10 consecutive season openers, averaging 36.1 points per game during a streak that includes a pair of upset wins over Texas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nHoward: The Bison face Youngstown State next Saturday, the second of four straight road games at the outset of the season.\n\nMaryland: A true test for the Terrapins looms next Saturday when No. 22 Syracuse arrives in College Park.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The game started with coach Michael Locksley and quarterback Josh Jackson unsure what to expect in their Maryland debut.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Ginsburg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/howard_maryland_football_77427_c0-152-3633-2270_s1770x1032.jpg?df045a2cd2666e960e93ce4dd70230139b09014e"}
