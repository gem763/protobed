While market analysts appeared skeptical the latest measure would be enough to prevent further capital flight, in Buenos Aires there was little sign of unease among ordinary savers. \u201cArgentina\u2019s financial system is solid,\u201d Central Bank president Guido Sandleris said in a press conference on Monday evening.\n\nA day earlier the bank had ordered exporters to repatriate foreign currency from the sale of their goods within five days, among other measures. Corporations now require the authorization of the bank to buy dollars in the foreign-exchange market, except in cases of international trade. Individual Argentines, meanwhile, are limited to dollar purchases of no more than $10,000 a month.\n\nThe move represents a bitter irony for the pro-market president, who set about dismantling capital controls as soon as he took office in 2015. Amid rising public panic and the looming specter of default, Macri is trying to stanch the hemorrhaging of dollars from the country by ripping up his orthodox economic playbook, reintroducing the kind of interventionist policies he once excoriated.\n\nWith presidential elections eight weeks away, Macri trails former cabinet chief Alberto Fernandez by a seemingly insurmountable distance. While the latest measures are unlikely to turn the tide, they may help Macri become the first non-Peronist president to finish his constitutional term in recent Argentine history. The knee-jerk reaction by investors was to dump more of the nation\u2019s assets, as seen in a plunge in euro-denominated bonds due 2022.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a phenomenal crisis of confidence in the economy, and the government is trying to patch up the effects of this crisis with the controls,\u201d Fausto Spotorno, economist and director of the Orlando Ferreres & Asociados consultancy in Buenos Aires, said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know if these patches will work.\u201d\n\nIn a note published later on Sunday, the International Monetary Fund described the move as \u201ccapital flow management\u201d and stated that it would \u201ccontinue to stand with Argentina during these challenging times.\u201d Last week the Macri administration announced plans to renegotiate payments on $44 billion it has borrowed from the IMF.\n\nSpeaking on local TV late on Sunday evening, Economy Minister Hernan Lacunza said that though the measures might be uncomfortable they would avoid worse outcomes. \u201cArgentina is like a boat stuck in circles, always returning to the same port. This isn\u2019t the port we dreamed of,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the challenge is to dock the boat on the pier on the 10 December.\u201d That date is when Macri\u2019s mandate ends.\n\nMacri\u2019s vice-presidential candidate Miguel Angel Pichetto also told local media that the government had taken the decision to ensure that volatility and short-term lack of liquidity did not impact Argentines. \u201cWhen the dollar rises, supermarket prices go up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe campaign has taken a backseat role as the government focuses on reassuring Argentines, according to an official from the presidency who declined to speak on record. While it\u2019s worse to campaign with currency controls in place, it\u2019s even worse with the exchange rate spiraling out of control, the person added.\n\nDeepening Crisis\n\nSunday\u2019s move shows how the crisis has moved beyond international bond investors to affect ordinary Argentines, who may choose to save in dollar bank accounts.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Aug. 11 primary elections that showed Fernandez on course for victory in October, Argentine depositors withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars from their accounts -- cash the central bank counts as part of its gross foreign reserves. These withdrawals, coupled with policy makers\u2019 sale of dollars to shore up the peso, has led to a dramatic fall in the country\u2019s stock of reserves.\n\nAround $3 billion drained out of the foreign-currency reserves on Thursday and Friday alone after the government changed the terms for its short-term debt. The country risks exhausting its net reserves, which stand at under $15 billion, within weeks if it keeps losing money at this pace.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Argentines and investors alike are cautiously assessing the impact of President Mauricio Macri\u2019s decision to impose capital controls on Sunday -- a blunt policy reversal aimed at containing the country\u2019s escalating financial crisis.Argentina\u2019s Eurobonds fell, while the peso strengthened", "authors": ["Jorgelina Do Rosario", "Philip Sanders"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nnSQ0s6J3sI08AnxL2zy3A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/8f07063e24bfa4b744488e7835624872"}
