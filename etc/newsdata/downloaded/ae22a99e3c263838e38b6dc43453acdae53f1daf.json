If the clubs cannot agree, then the committee will choose.\n\nThe Spanish league wanted the match to be moved from Barcelona to Madrid because of security concerns, with the return match automatically switched from Madrid to Barcelona. But the competitions committee rejected that idea, saying that it was against its rules to invert the order of the games.\n\nThe federation, in consultation with government officials, said Thursday it wasn't safe to play on the same day as the rally.\n\nThe Spanish league runs the top two soccer divisions in the country, while the federation controls regulations and matches for professional and amateur games.\n\nThe northeastern Catalonia region has seen violent protests for the last few days with police clashing with protesters angered by a Supreme Court decision to sentence nine separatist leaders to prison. Separatist groups have called for supporters to rally in Barcelona on Oct. 26, the original date of the match.\n\nBarcelona's Lionel Messi, right, vies for the ball with Sevilla's Daniel Carrico during Spanish La Liga soccer match between Barcelona and Sevilla at the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.
