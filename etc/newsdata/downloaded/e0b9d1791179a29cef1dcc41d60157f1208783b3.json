At least not yet.\n\nI\u2019ve loved long distance running since I was 15-years-old. In the 32 years since, I\u2019ve logged well over 60,000 miles, including 77 marathons and ultramarathons. To me, running is more than exercise. It\u2019s a gift from God.\n\nIn recent years, I\u2019ve limited my workouts to early mornings and just one race per year \u2013 Colorado's Pikes Peak Marathon.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS WOMAN MISTAKENLY SIGNS UP FOR HALF-MARATHON IN BRITISH CITY WITH SAME NAME AS US CITY\n\nMore an endurance event than a traditional footrace, runners begin in the small town of Manitou Springs (elevation 6,300 feet) and ascend to the famed mountain\u2019s summit (14,115 feet), then turn around and run the 13 miles back down Barr Trail.\n\nI completed my 20th consecutive Pikes Peak in August 2018. In May this year, I began increasing my mileage for the annual August race. I soon found myself injured and was diagnosed with a condition called piriformis syndrome, the tightening of a thick muscle in the rear-end, right where the hamstrings connect to the pelvis and where the sciatic nerve passes down into the leg.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTreatments had little effect. But runners run and no pain, no gain, so I continued to push through. I ordered new orthotics for my shoes, thinking that might be the culprit. I began an aggressive stretching regimen \u2013 and foolishly overstretched to the point of straining my hamstrings.\n\nI was undeterred. I was determined to keep my marathon streak alive.\n\nI became convinced I had Ischial Bursitis \u2013 inflammation in the \u201csits-bone\u201d area of my rear end. My family physician gave me a cortisone shot. The pain persisted.\n\nIn late July, I began seeing a new physical therapist, a wonderful family friend who spent 20 years in the Air Force keeping America's pilots pain-free in the air despite grueling 30 hours flights in cramped cockpits. Scott diagnosed me with a litany of muscular-skeletal issues \u2013 the consequences of decades of uneven stretching and a lack of core-strengthening exercises.\n\nThe marathon grew closer but the pain remained. Scott urged patience. Three days before the race, he introduced me to two men in the rehabilitation center. They thought they could get me ready to run by using something called \u201cAccelerated Recovery Performance (ARP) Wave neurological therapy.\u201d\n\nARP therapy is an unconventional electronic stimulation rehab system that forces muscles to contract rapidly, leading your brain and nervous system to alter and correct the movements that caused the trouble in the first place. It\u2019s controversial. The Soviets used it on their athletes before it was perfected, and it burned skin. I didn\u2019t quite understand it all, but in desperation agreed to give it a try.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to explain to how painful the treatment was but just imagine trying to work out injured on a treadmill while someone is shocking you with what seems like high voltage electricity. It buckled my legs and curled my toes.\n\nThe treatment left me soaked in sweat and as sore as if I had run a marathon. I\u2019m told injured NFL players and other high-performance athletes use it to great effect, but it didn\u2019t work for me. I was grateful to Scott and the team for trying. To paraphrase the popular breakup line, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t them \u2013 it was me.\u201d\n\nI wound up withdrawing from the race on Saturday night and spent time on Sunday pondering the streak\u2019s end, wondering why it had meant so much to me, enough that I was willing to undergo painful treatment that felt akin to being electrocuted.\n\nThe ordeal reminded me that nothing lasts forever and good things can become ultimate things, obsessions that lead you down desperate roads. Where an alcoholic may hit the bottle, I lace up my shoes and hit the road. A healthier habit, but too much of anything is too much.\n\nI was also confronted with the fact that I\u2019ve allowed running to become too much a part of my identity. I liked the fact that not many people have run the Pikes Peak Marathon 20 times in a row. But injuries can humble you \u2013 and now instead of wanting to complete a marathon, I only wish I could run someday run a single mile without stabbing pain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMy path forward remains uncertain. An MRI revealed a collapsed disc, among other spinal abnormalities. My therapists are still optimistic \u2013 and so am I.\n\nThere are plenty of people with far more physical troubles than me. But setbacks often give us time to think and reevaluate \u2013 I only wish it didn\u2019t take getting shocked to set me straight.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM PAUL BATURA", "description": "Setbacks often give us time to think and reevaluate \u2013 I only wish it didn\u2019t take getting shocked to set me straight.", "authors": ["Paul Batura", "Paul J.
