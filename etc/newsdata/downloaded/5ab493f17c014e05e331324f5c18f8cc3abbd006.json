The President \u201cbelieves we shouldn\u2019t be doing that to each other,\u201d one former Trump administration official told CNN.\n\nIn addition to his fear such foreign intelligence sources will damage his relationship with foreign leaders, Trump has expressed doubts about the credibility of the information they provide. Another former senior intelligence official told CNN that Trump \u201cbelieves they\u2019re people who are selling out their country.\u201d\n\nEven in public, Trump has looked down on these foreign assets, as they are known in the intelligence community. Responding to reports that the CIA recruited Kim Jong Un\u2019s brother as a spy, Trump said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t let that happen under my auspices.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": ""}
