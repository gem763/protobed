I love a fry-up: fish and chips; Sunday dinners and ice cream. I love caramel Ben and Jerry's - good stuff that!\n\nA few weeks ago I was at a wedding and people were having a drink outside. I never thought a pint could look so appetising!\n\nI started camp for the Lee Selby and Carl Frampton fights around 10st 7lb but once I started training this time, after about a week or so I was back down to around 10st so there was just a bit of puppy fat sitting on there!\n\nI'm always excited to begin camp because after two or three weeks out of the gym you've had a bit of time to recharge mentally as well as physically. Even after going toe to toe with Carl Frampton over 12 rounds I felt good after five days.\n\nThe Leeds Warrior poses with a signed glove at the beginning of his gruelling 12-week camp\n\nIt's more mental because you know that once you start camp that's it until the fight. You have to give 100 per cent every day, you have to prepare for those sacrifices and you know you are going to be putting your body through a gruelling regime every day.\n\nThe first four weeks are about getting my fitness, strength and conditioning records to a high level. Then we are working on gameplans and repetition for the next two weeks. Then the last six weeks are more or less focused on sparring. Normally in a camp we'll cover 120 rounds.\n\nAs the training weeks go by your weight starts to drop and the last couple of weeks are when you want to be coming into form.\n\nTWO WEEKS TO THE FIGHT\n\nWeight: 9st 12lb (12lb to lose)\n\nI'm getting tired now. We're doing two sparring sessions a week to make the equivalent of two full fights, the endurance circuits have stepped up and the runs are faster and more intense I'm starting to look drawn in the face, my waist has started to slim down, my legs feel skinny. I can certainly see more muscles.\n\nMy abs look absolutely ripped but on certain days you can see the veins in my body because the fat is coming to a minimum.\n\nWith two weeks to go, my diet is a lot tighter. I'm not going into the cupboards to nibble at a little bit of chocolate. I'm having four meals a day, but around this time you start craving, for the feeling of being full more than anything.\n\nThis is when you start driving past takeaways and the grottiest one looks really appealing. I'm very lucky that my wife is my personal chef so she always spices it up when she can.\n\nWith two weeks until the fight, Warrington keeps to a strict diet as he continues to burn fat\n\nOnce I get into camp, all the sweet stuff gets knocked on the head. I am banned from going to the supermarket because it's just torture. When you walk past the dessert aisle all of a sudden it looks like the most appetising thing in the world.\n\nI've had my first weigh-in and I am around 9st 12lb, which seems heavy, but because my daughters have been poorly I wanted to stay heavier so I'm not as susceptible to colds, coughs, flu, viruses.\n\nWhen you're losing weight your immune system weakens.\n\nIn the last few weeks of camp the weight starts to drop so we're not doing as many training sessions because you haven't got as much energy. You can have sports massages, days off, cryotherapy, but the body has been training for weeks, just tearing away at itself. You have to force yourself to get up, get in the gym and give it 100 per cent. This is where your mentality really comes into it.\n\nONE WEEK TO THE FIGHT\n\nWeight: 9st 8lb (8lb to lose)\n\nTraining is at a minimum and you're only really eating to get by. I'm not starving myself and not skipping meals; that's a massive no-no. Your body will go into shock and stop burning because it thinks it's not getting food.\n\nFamily or friends think I might be offended if they're eating a Sunday roast or a McDonald's but it really doesn't bother me.\n\nYou just miss being satisfied, the feeling of 'that hit the spot'.\n\nI have a final check weigh-in. I'm not allowed to be more than 9st 3lb so I'll lose 2lb today, 2lb tomorrow and maybe a walk on Wednesday and I'll have made the limit.\n\nI've always managed my weight well. But in 2015 I woke up on the day of the weigh-in for my fight with Dennis Tubieron and I was around 9st 6lb. I went for a walk with a sweatsuit on and only lost 1lb. A little run in sweatsuit took off another pound. Some fighters go into saunas with sweatsuits, but I sat in a red-hot bath up to my neck for around an hour-and-a-half. That's the hardest I've had to work to make weight.\n\nThe 28-year-old fighter works on his core in the build up to his third title defence in Leeds\n\nThe pressure of the fight is coming, tiredness is kicking in and you're losing weight quickly.\n\nI'm normally laid back but if someone cuts me up when I'm driving, I'm snappy! You look at other people, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, and take inspiration from them. He's well into his 30s and he keeps on shining because he's an athlete who lives the life.\n\nAll the training we do is for that one night. Weeks of graft, hours in the gym, thousands of punches, miles of running all come down to 36 minutes.\n\nOver the years I've had hard times when I'd finish work, have to go to the gym and I was just so hungry. But I have to do things properly, realise it's not going to last for ever and think about the fish and chips, kebabs and fry-ups I'll eat after!\n\nFRIDAY\n\nWeight: 9st 3lbs (3lbs to lose)\n\nThe final few hours are the toughest as the pressure of the fight is creeping up. The night before the weigh-in, I'll go to bed around 9st 5lb, wake up around 9st 3lb and by the time I've gone to the toilet, I'm around 9st 2.5lb. Then 20 minutes in a red-hot bath normally does the trick. It's simply about cutting out water.\n\nYou feel weak but I try to picture myself in the bath and my opponent in the room. I wouldn't want him to see me struggling so I snap out of any moaning.\n\nI always come in under 9st just in case the scales aren't as accurate as mine. Then once I've made weight, rehydration is a steady process. Once, years ago, I ate too much and ended up being sick.\n\nWarrington (left) and Takoucht (right) face off after both making the required weight on Friday\n\nNow I don't put too much in, too quickly. Having excess food wobbling about in your stomach when you're taking body shots is not a good feeling.\n\nI've made myself ill by eating a load of crap instantly after the fight, too.\n\nNormally I'll put on around 10lb after the weigh-in. Around 9st 9/10lb is where I'm at my optimum and that's where I'll likely be for the first bell.\n\nJosh Warrington was talking to Sportsmail's Daniel Matthews\n\nTV: Live tonight on BT Sport 1 from 7.30pm.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The 28-year-old 'Leeds Warrior' had to slim down to below 9st and he invited Sportsmail inside his gruelling 12-week camp as he battled to shed weight\u2026", "authors": ["Daniel Matthews For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/18/19600360-0-image-a-17_1570814253424.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
