These include those who took up arms for Islamic State.\n\nSenator Reynolds would not be drawn on whether Canberra had been given advanced notice of Mr Trump's surprise announcement that US forces would withdraw from Syria's border region with Turkey.\n\nThe withdrawal effectively abandons Kurdish militias who had been western allies in the fight against Islamic State to the threat of a Turkish offensive. However, facing a rare backlash from his own Republican Party, Mr Trump warned Ankara it would face economic sanctions if it moved against the Kurds.\n\nAustralia has a complex relationship with the Kurdish people. While the air force in 2014 helped transport arms to Peshmerga fighters in northern Iraq's Kurdistan during early fighting against Islamic State, Canberra has proscribed the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist group since 2005 for its violent campaign for autonomy against Turkey.", "description": "More than 60 Australian women and children are trapped in the camps, set up by Kurdish forces to house foreign fighters and their families.
