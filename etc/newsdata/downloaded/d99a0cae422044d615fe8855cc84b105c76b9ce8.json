But the \u2018noble\u2019 goal of helping the rioters praised in the Western media brought unintended consequences.\n\n\"The app displays police locations and we have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimize residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAlso on rt.com Why is Apple 'guiding Hong Kong thugs'? US corporations face choice between virtue-signaling and business\n\nThe move to remove the app also came after a rebuke from Beijing. On Wednesday, the Chinese People\u2019s Daily published an op-ed titled \u201cIs Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\u201d It warned that the map app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior\u201d and that Apple is hurting its reputation among Chinese consumers by \u201cmixing business with politics and commercial activity with illegal activities.\u201d\n\nApple manufactures most of its products in China, which is the second-largest market for Apple products.\n\nInitially the company rejected the app \u2013 which displays not only police movements, but also whether tear gas has been used in particular areas, among other protester-specific features \u2013 but decided to reconsider the move after an appeal. The demonstrations that started over a now-shelved extradition bill in March have turned into weekly riots with radical groups of protesters vandalizing property, beating people for supporting Beijing, and attacking police.\n\nAlso on rt.com WATCH Hong Kong protesters beat & set fire to \u2018off-duty cop\u2019\n\nWhile rejecting the government\u2019s invitation for negotiations, the protesters became darlings of the Western media, which describes them as \u2018pro-democracy\u2019. They have enjoyed the open support of US and European politicians and celebrities despite repeated calls from Beijing not to interfere in its internal affairs. American companies soon followed suit.\n\nBoth American shoe company Vans and the NBA have also become embroiled in Hong Kong\u2019s unrest, with Vans drawing the ire of protesters after scrapping a shoe design favorable to the demonstrations. Some in the city are now calling for a boycott of the company. As for the NBA, its trouble began with a single tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who voiced support for the protesters. The tweet has since blown up into a conflict between the basketball league and Beijing, which has stopped airing games on its largest state broadcaster.\n\nCompanies like Apple are no stranger to political controversy, especially in the Trump era, when seemingly every corporation must signal their virtue on a range of touchy issues, from transgender-friendly pronouns, to any protests that erupt anywhere on Earth. However, even with Beijing half a world away from Cupertino, California, Apple may find that alienating a customer base of 1.4 billion people is not a good idea.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
