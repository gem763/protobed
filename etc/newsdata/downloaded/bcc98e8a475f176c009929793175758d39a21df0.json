I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk,\u201d James said in a news release. \u201cWe will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook\u2019s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\u201d\n\nBREAKING: I\u2019m launching an investigation into Facebook to determine whether their actions endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers\u2019 choices, or increased the price of advertising.\n\n\n\nThe largest social media platform in the world must follow the law. \u2014 NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) September 6, 2019\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that more than half the nation\u2019s attorneys general are readying an investigation of Google, but it was unclear whether other tech giants such as Amazon would find themselves in the coalition\u2019s crosshairs (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Post). The coalition of state attorneys general will formally announce the multistate investigative effort Monday in Washington.\n\nFacebook denied it has violated antitrust laws and said it welcomed the states\u2019 probe.\n\n\u201cPeople have multiple choices for every one of the services we provide,\u201d Will Castleberry, Facebook\u2019s vice president of state and local policy, said in a statement. \u201cWe understand that if we stop innovating, people can easily leave our platform. This underscores the competition we face, not only in the US but around the globe.\u201d\n\nCastleberry pledged to \u201cwork constructively with the attorneys general and we welcome a conversation with policymakers about the competitive environment in which we operate.\u201d\n\nRegulators around the country in recent months have signaled growing concern about the breadth of Silicon Valley\u2019s power, questioning the industry\u2019s access to vast amounts of users\u2019 personal data and expressing concern that the huge profits that Facebook and Google generate allow those companies to buy up potential rivals and maintain their dominance \u2014 to the detriment of consumers.\n\n[Does Elizabeth Warren\u2019s breakup plan for the tech giants mark the end of a political romance?]\n\nTwo federal antitrust agencies have opened probes targeting the industry broadly, while lawmakers in Congress have grilled executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google about their business practices. But it remains to be seen whether the investigations will stick to some of the world\u2019s most powerful companies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a broad movement to break up companies solely because they are large will fail without a change to existing antitrust laws,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note to investors Friday. \u201cThe \u2018too big, must be broken up\u2019 argument is a more difficult one to make in our opinion as current antitrust law does not provide for a forced breakup solely due to the size of the business; if it did, Walmart would have been broken up decades ago.\u201d\n\nIn July, Facebook paid $5 billion and agreed to submit to significant federal oversight of its business practices to settle Federal Trade Commission allegations that the company had repeatedly deceived its users about how and who was accessing their personal data. The fine was the largest in history for a privacy violation, but only a fraction of the $55.8 billion in revenue Facebook took in 2018.\n\nFor Google, the states\u2019 heightened interest comes about six years after the U.S. government formally studied the tech giant\u2019s search-and-advertising business but opted against slapping it with significant penalties. The inaction in the United States stands in stark contrast with the European Union, which has issued a series of multibillion-dollar fines for the way Google displays search results and manages its Android smartphone operating system.", "description": "Regulators across the country have signaled growing concerns about the breadth of Silicon Valley\u2019s power and the tech industry\u2019s access to vast amounts of proprietary data.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News", "Tony Romm", "Senior Tech Policy Reporter", "September At Pm", "Taylor Telford Is A Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News.", "Tony Romm Is A Technology Policy Reporter At The Washington Post.
