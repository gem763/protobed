The union provided a copy of the letter to Reuters.\n\n\u201cThese negotiations have taken a turn for the worse,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe, in this union, could not be more disappointed with General Motors,\u201d Dittes said. \u201cThe company has shown an unwillingness to fairly compensate ... the UAW.\u201d\n\nDittes said the UAW made an offer on Saturday to GM that covered wages, signing bonuses, job security, profit sharing and other issues. He said GM responded on Sunday morning with its counteroffer, which \u201cdid nothing to advance a whole host of issues.\u201d\n\nGM said in a statement that it was committed to negotiating \u201caround the clock\u201d to reach a deal.\n\n\u201cWe continue to negotiate in good faith with very good proposals that benefit employees today and build a stronger future for all of us,\u201d the company said in the statement.\n\nThe GM strike began on Sept. 16 with its 48,000 UAW members seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the automaker\u2019s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. The sides have been meeting daily.\n\nOne key issue is around assembly of future vehicles. The UAW wants GM to make commitments on future products it would build in various plants beyond what has currently been offered, said a person familiar with the talks who asked not to be identified.\n\nGM officials previously said the Detroit company\u2019s labour rates are the highest in the industry and it needs the ability to build some vehicles in other markets to keep costs down.\n\nJust before the strike began, GM, the largest U.S. automaker by vehicle sales, said that its offer to the UAW included plans to invest more than $7 billion in its U.S. plants over the life of the deal.\n\nGM also said then it had \u201csolutions\u201d for the Lordstown, Ohio, and Detroit assembly plants that it had previously said would cease making vehicles. Sources said at the time those plans included a battery plant in Ohio and building an electric truck in Detroit.\n\nThe UAW has previously said it wants GM to shift vehicle assembly work back from other countries like Mexico and China. The source said that remains an issue in the talks.\n\nFILE PHOTO: General Motors assembly workers picket outside the General Motors Bowling Green plant during the United Auto Workers (UAW) national strike in Bowling Green, Kentucky, U.S., September 17, 2019.

U.S. President Donald Trump and many Democrats have urged GM to shift production to unused or underused U.S. plants.\n\nOther issues remaining in the talks include wages and pensions, the source previously said.\n\nAnalysts estimate the strike has cost GM over $1 billion, while LMC Automotive estimated on Thursday that GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2.", "description": "Talks for a new four-year labour contract between General Motors Co and its striking workers took a \"turn for the worse\" on Sunday after the United Auto Workers rejected the largest U.S. automaker's latest offer but the two sides were still talking.", "authors": ["Ben Klayman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437776871&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950GB", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
