Let's have a new one, a new acronym of course, because Brexit has been nothing if not a journey through collections of syllables that once might have seemed unfamiliar to even political aficionados, but now trip off the tongue.\n\nDUP? Easy one, the Tories' Northern Irish allies.\n\nERG, obvious too, the European Research Group - the Brexiteers' club.\n\nThen there is NCP, what was once upon a time Theresa May's plan for customs, the IP, the implementation period, the departure lounge after Brexit, and so on, and so on, and so, until we all lose the will to live.\n\nIf you are still with me then let's introduce 'DBP', because on a very odd day in Westminster, it's the phrase I have heard almost more than any other - difficult but possible.\n\nRead Laura's full blog here.\n\nRegardless of what happens in Brussels, a showdown is anticipated in an emergency sitting of Parliament on Saturday - the first in 37 years, if it goes ahead.\n\nMPs will be able to back or reject any deal presented to them and there will be discussions on what to do next.\n\nHowever, Mr Rees-Mogg did not confirm the sitting would happen, saying it would depend on events in Brussels.\n\nBBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the widely-held view among the EU was that the UK was unlikely to be leaving on 31 October, and the question was whether an extension could be short in order to iron out some small issues, or had to be much longer to deal with bigger problems.\n\nTimeline: What's happening ahead of Brexit deadline?\n\nThursday 17 October - Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline.\n\nSaturday 19 October - Special sitting of Parliament expected - and the date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by MPs and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal.\n\nThursday 31 October - Date by which the UK is currently due to leave the EU.", "description": "Brexit negotiations enter a key 24 hours, as EU leaders prepare to meet at a summit in Brussels.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A20C/production/_109248414_brexitflags-epa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
