Volatility in international financial markets will increase.\n\nChina has been able to keep capital outflows under control over the past year despite an escalating trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home.\n\nReserves have rebounded from an October 2018 low thanks to capital controls and rising foreign investments in Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nIn September, the yuan rose 0.14% against the dollar after posting its biggest monthly drop in 25 years in August.\n\nThe yuan has now depreciated about 11% against the dollar since the two sides began exchanging tit-for-tat tariffs in April last year.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.47% in September against a basket of other major currencies ( ).\n\nECONOMIC RISKS\n\nChina burned through $1 trillion of reserves supporting the yuan in the last economic downturn in 2015, which also saw it devalue the currency in a surprise move.\n\nChina's economic growth risks slipping below the lower-end of Beijing 2019 target of 6% in the third quarter or over the next year, analysts warn, as the trade war with the United States persists.\n\nFactory activity surveys in China pointed to slight improvement in September as domestic demand picked up, but analysts believe the gains will be short-lived as the property market cools and Sino-U.S. trade tensions remain elevated.\n\nTop-level trade negotiators from China and the United States are expected to meet in Washington on Oct.10-11 to determine if they can agree on a truce in the trade war, but most analysts doubt a durable agreement can be reached.\n\nHigher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are due to take effect in mid-October and mid-December, and sources told Reuters the Trump administration is considering radical new pressure tactics on Beijing, including the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nTo shore up the Chinese economy, the central bank in early September cut banks' reserve requirements for the third time this year, releasing 900 billion yuan ($126.35 billion) in liquidity. China also trimmed its new benchmark lending rate in September for the second month in a row.\n\nStill, with higher U.S. tariffs looming, analysts say more forceful measures will be needed soon to avoid a sharper slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nChina has also been ramping up its gold reserves this year.\n\nIt held 62.64 million fine troy ounces of gold at end-September, up 5.2% from 59.560 million ounces at the end of 2018.\n\nThe value of its gold reserves fell to $93.045 billion at end-September from $95.45 billion at the end of August.", "description": "China's September forex reserves fall to $3.092 trillion", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF950BD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
