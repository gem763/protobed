'The road team has just played better baseball in the first six games. I don't know what to tell you about that.'\n\n'We're waiting until the last game to have it on our side,' Astros Manager A.J. Hinch joked of home-field advantage. 'We worked really hard to get home-field, and we're happy to play at home. We have no problem playing at home. This place will be rocking. We've won a ton of games in this ballpark. This series has been very weird.'\n\nA key factor in the Nationals' 7-1 loss in Game 5 at Nationals Park could play to their advantage in the series finale.\n\nWashington ace right-hander Max Scherzer (3-0, 2.16 ERA this postseason), a late scratch Sunday due to spasms in his neck and trapezius, declared himself fit to start Game 7 after throwing in the outfield on Tuesday. Scherzer, the Game 1 winner after allowing two runs in five innings, had a cortisone shot in his neck last weekend, and his condition improved dramatically during the travel day Monday.\n\nWith the Nationals clinging to a one-run lead in the latter stages of Game 6, Scherzer went to the bullpen to warm up, seemingly to enter the contest in a high-leverage situation. Nationals third baseman Anthony Rendon spared Nats manager Dave Martinez of having to make a decision regarding Scherzer, hitting a two-run homer in the seventh inning, pushing the lead to 5-2.\n\n'He said he felt good,' Martinez said of Scherzer. 'And he didn't ... warm up to get in the game, he was just throwing to get loose. And after the game, he's ready to go.'\n\nHouston Astros players Jose Altuve , Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman hug before Game 7\n\nThe Astros will counter in Game 7 with right-hander Zack Greinke (0-2, 5.30 ERA). Greinke has delivered uneven results for Houston this postseason, even in Houston victories. He combined to log just nine innings in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees and Game 3 of the World Series, allowing two runs on 10 hits and seven walks with 11 strikeouts.\n\nGreinke has made one start at Minute Maid Park this postseason, and it qualified as his best outing even though he took the loss. He allowed three runs on seven hits with six strikeouts over six innings in Game 1 of the ALCS.\n\nA heralded acquisition at the trade deadline, Greinke has yet to deliver a signature pitching performance for the Astros. Game 7 would serve as a timely reminder of his stellar resume and validate what Houston surrendered (four minor-leaguers) to secure his services from the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\n'A little excited about it at the moment, but we'll see,' Greinke said of his pending start before cracking a smile while adding, 'I wish it was in a National League park.'\n\nThe Astros won a club-record 60 games at home this season and endured a losing skid of more than two games at Minute Maid Park only once (Sept 10-12 against the Oakland Athletics) prior to the World Series.\n\nWhile the pitching matchup appears to favor the Nationals, the odds of Houston dropping four consecutive games at home for the first time all season would seem slim given past results. But given the odd nature of this World Series, confidently predicting what comes next is folly.\n\n'We don't know, but we're going to continue to try to ride this wave as long as possible,' said Rendon, who drove in five runs Tuesday. 'Maybe they enjoy our park and maybe we enjoy their park. We're not going to ask questions, we're just going to try to go out there and just have some fun.'\n\nJose Altuve flips his glove during batting practice before Game 7", "description": "After seeing the road team win the first six games, the Houston Astros are hosting the Washington Nationals in the seventh and deciding game of the 2019 World Series at Minute Maid Park.", "authors": ["Alex Raskin Sports News Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/22/20400508-0-image-a-2_1572475959686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
