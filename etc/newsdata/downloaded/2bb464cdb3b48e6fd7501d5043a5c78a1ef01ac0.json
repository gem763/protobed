Almost 200 people \u2013 many civilians \u2013 have been killed in the fighting. Some 130,000 refugees have been created, the UN has said, mostly those fleeing the bombarded towns of Ras al-Ain and Tel Abyad.\n\nAnkara accuses the Kurds of being terrorists and says it wants to drive them out of a planned so-called \u201csafe zone\u201d reaching 30km into Syria.\n\nIt launched its invasion on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump withdrew American troops from the region \u2013 an unexpected move widely condemned by both domestic supporters and international allies alike.\n\nEven the Turkish Republic in Northern Cyprus \u2013 a de facto state that is traditionally Turkey\u2019s strongest supporter \u2013 called for peace and dialogue.\n\nConcerns centre around the betrayal of the Kurds, one of West\u2019s staunchest historical allies in the region, and the fact that the area is home to prisons containing thousands of Isis fighters.\n\nAround 100 Isis-affiliated women and children escaped from a camp on Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces has said it cannot continue guarding these detainees if it also has to fight the Turkish army \u2013 meaning the release of countless terrorists into the already devastated region.\n\n\"Guarding Isis prisons is no longer a priority,\u201d SDF spokesperson Redur Xelil said in a televised statement on Saturday evening. \u201cWhoever cares about the secure detention of the prisoners, they are welcome to come and find a solution.\"\n\nTo add to the confusion, Isis declared on Saturday that it has already started regrouping and will launch a fresh campaign in Syria to avenge those members detained. It claimed responsibility for two deadly car bombs in the cities of Qamishli and Hassakeh which occurred on Friday.\n\nIn other developments, it has emerged Kurdish politician Hervin Khalaf was among nine civilians killed on a road in northern Syria by Turkish-backed forces. The secretary general of the Future Syria Party was ordered out of her car and executed, reports suggest.\n\nA spokesman for the Turkish-backed rebel group the Syrian National Army denied carrying out the killings, saying it had not advanced that far, Reuters reported.\n\nSeparately on Saturday, thousands of people marched in a number of European cities, including Paris and Berlin, in protest against the Turkish assault.\n\nRead more\n\nHow Turkey hopes to kill Kurdish self-rule with a short, cheap war\n\nUS warns Turkey it has right to self-defence in Syria\n\nIsis militants break out of prison in Syria after bombing by Turkey\n\nTens of thousands flee Turkish bombing in Syria\n\nThe vacuum left by the US in Syria clears a breeding ground for Isis\n\nIsis fighters break out of north Syria jail amid fighting", "description": "The UK has called on Turkey to end its offensive in Syria as France and Germany have halted arms sales to Ankara amid growing international outrage over the invasion.The weapons suspension came as Boris Johnson also called on Ankara to end the offensive in a phone call with President Recep Erdogan, while", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fNximRkJjYHcS4tq1N923A--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/2ef690d9cf38dfb572e36b7578627582", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
