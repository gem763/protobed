ByteDance, the Beijing-based company that owns TikTok, says the moderation guidelines were replaced in May.\n\nAs well as the general moderation guidelines, described as the \u201cloose version\u201d to moderators, TikTok ran at least two other sets.\n\nOne, the \u201cstrict\u201d guidelines, were used in countries with conservative moral codes, and contained a significantly more restrictive set of rules concerning nudity and vulgarity, which ban, for instance, \u201cpartially naked buttocks\u201d, exposed cleavage with \u201ca length of more than 1/3 of the whole cleavage length\u201d, and lengthy depictions of sanitary pads.\n\nThe other was a set of guidelines for individual countries, which introduced new rules to deal with specific local controversies \u2013 but also further restricted what can be shown. For instance, the Guardian has seen Turkey-specific guidelines in which TikTok explicitly banned a swathe of content related to Kurdish separatism, and adds the country\u2019s founding father, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to the list of political leaders who cannot be criticised, defamed or spoofed on the platform.\n\nBut the local guidelines also barred a host of behaviours which are both legal and accepted in Turkey. Depictions of alcohol consumption were barred, for instance, even though 17% of Turks drink. So too were any depictions of statues of \u201cnon-Islamic gods\u201d, with examples given of \u201cJesus, Maria, angels\u201d.\n\nQ&A What is TikTok? Show Hide TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with an estimated 500 million users worldwide. Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017. The merger meant TikTok ended up on the smartphones of more than 60 million users overnight. Bytedance has a valuation of $75bn (\u00a360bn), based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-second clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to a record-breaking run at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, Bytedance was fined a record $5.7m in the US for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13, and has been under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network. Alex Hern, UK technology editor\n\nAnd an entire section of the rules was devoted to censoring depictions of homosexuality. \u201cIntimate activities (holding hands, touching, kissing) between homosexual lovers\u201d were censored, as were \u201creports of homosexual groups, including news, characters, music, tv show, pictures\u201d. Similarly blocked was content about \u201cprotecting rights of homosexuals (parade, slogan, etc.)\u201d and \u201cpromotion of homosexuality\u201d. In all those guidelines, TikTok went substantially further than required by law.\n\nThe country-specific guidelines took on a new relevance following the Guardian\u2019s initial reporting on TikTok\u2019s censorship, in which ByteDance said that the guidelines had been retired in May in favour of \u201clocalised approaches, including local moderators, local content and moderation policies, local refinement of global policies\u201d.\n\nThe Turkey and Strict versions of the moderation guidelines suggest those localised approaches may not be less censorious than the previous centralised approach.\n\nIn a statement, TikTok said it was \u201ca platform for creativity, and committed to equality and diversity\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur platform has experienced rapid growth in Turkey and other markets, and as we grow we are constantly learning and refining our approach to moderation. The referenced guidelines regarding LGBTQ content in Turkey are no longer in use, and we have since made significant progress in establishing a more robust localised approach. However, we recognise the need to do more and we are actively working with local third parties and independent advisers to ensure our processes are appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian also reported that TikTok took the unusual approach of erring on the side of risk when it came to sexualised content featuring children: videos of them wearing \u201csexy outfits\u201d or \u201cdancing seductively\u201d.\n\nThe platform\u2019s guidelines advised moderators to treat subjects as though they were over 18 if their age was unclear, while other platforms instead recommend their moderators take the side of caution, particularly if the content has been reported as underage.\n\nAndy Burrows, the NSPCC\u2019s head of child safety online policy, criticised the approach, and said: \u201cThese guidelines demonstrate that TikTok has woefully failed to grasp the seriousness of child abuse imagery.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, TikTok is taking a cavalier approach by telling moderators that if they aren\u2019t sure whether someone is a child or not, to assume they are an adult.\n\n\u201cUltimately, TikTok needs to fundamentally reassess its attitude to handling inappropriate images of children on its site. The fact that they use wholly unsuitable language like \u2018underage pornography\u2019 and \u2018sexy outfits\u2019 to describe this horrific content speaks volumes.\u201d\n\nTikTok says it has since reversed the policy, and now requires moderators to treat people as under 18 if there was any doubt.", "description": "Chinese-owned social media app bans such content even in countries where homosexuality has never been illegal", "authors": ["Alex Hern"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97625fd9214925b700dceb4a81836b8ee5e34072/1840_1096_2481_1488/master/2481.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33e217d158b4bd6d1934863ad344e97e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
