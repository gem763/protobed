However, it\u2019s the first outing and I\u2019m pretty OK with it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to competing tomorrow, hopefully clean up some of the mistakes I made today and just keep going for it.\u201d\n\nChen, 20, hasn\u2019t lost a Grand Prix event since his silver medal at the Grand Prix Final in 2016, and it seems unlikely he\u2019ll be caught in Vegas, which is hosting the event for the first time.\n\nIt was an emotional night for Messing, who was competing less than a month after his younger brother, Paxon, was killed when an SUV collided with his motorcycle.\n\nThe 27-year-old Canadian said just making the trip to Vegas was difficult.\n\n\u201cAll the elements seemed pretty solid today,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just really happy to be able to come here and skate.\n\n\u201cComing here this week was a huge decision for me with everything that\u2019s happened.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Peng Cheng and Jin Yang, who were fourth at the World Championships in Japan in March, grabbed a narrow lead in the pairs short programme their 72.73 points putting them just 1.48 ahead of Russian Daria Pavliuchenko and Denis Khodykin.\n\nUS champions Ashley Cain-Gribble and Timothy LeDuc were third on 68.20.\n\nIn the women\u2019s short programme, former US champion Bradie Tennell leads a pair of Japanese skaters with 75.10 points.\n\nTennell, who has had trouble cracking the top five in the series of late, has a slight lead over Kaori Sakamoto and Wakaba Higuchi.
