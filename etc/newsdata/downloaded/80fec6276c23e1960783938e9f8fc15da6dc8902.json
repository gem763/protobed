Tom Craddick who said Ator had previously failed a background check, according to the Midland Reporter-Telegram.\n\nNo details were given as to what caused him to fail.\n\nAtor first opened fire at state troopers who pulled him over in his gold Toyota pick-up truck for a minor signaling infraction along a stretch of I-20 near Midland, Texas, on Saturday.\n\nHe then peeled off, firing indiscriminately out of the truck as he floored it towards Odessa, authorities said.\n\nAlong the way, he killed a USPS worker and hijacked her mail truck, continuing the spree, officials said.\n\nHe made his last stand in the parking lot of an Odessa movie theater, where he was killed in a shootout with cops.\n\nThis story originally appeared at NYPost.com", "description": "The Texas madman who went on a mobile shooting spree had been fired from his job just hours before his rampage \u2014 and had previously failed a background...", "authors": ["Lee Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ534_westte_ZG_20190902092214.jpg"}
