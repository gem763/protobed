It\u2019s history.\u201d Lenny Henry is explaining why he has decided to write an autobiography (Who Am I, Again?) about his childhood in Dudley and the beginning of his 45-year comedy career. For Henry, this isn\u2019t just a bit of navel-gazing and the odd anecdote featuring Chris Tarrant (although there is some of that). It is about bearing witness. \u201cI grew up in a period where, just down the road in Smethwick, a Tory politician got in with the slogan \u2018If you want a nigger for a neighbour vote Labour\u2019,\u201d he says, referring to Peter Griffiths\u2019 notorious 1964 election win for the Conservatives. \u201cI\u2019m living just down the road from Wolverhampton, where the Rivers of Blood speech was made. So I\u2019m in a place where there are toxic elements that you think would be an obstacle to my progress in life. But, actually, I think those things are part of what makes us stronger.\u201d\n\nHenry tells me this as we sit in the corner of a lounge bar that looks out over the old BBC Television Centre in west London. The place is decked out in mid-century modern decor, with plush stools and mood lighting. If we were meeting in the evening, you would expect him to order an old fashioned, but it is not even 10am and all he wants is a bit of toast. Henry \u2013 who is half incognito in a flat cap, glasses and a polka dot scarf \u2013 seems to be on first-name terms with all the staff and politely asks one of them to turn the muzak down a bit. This is very much his domain. \u201cAll that used to be offices,\u201d he says, gesturing toward a section of the building that has been turned into luxury flats. \u201cYou\u2019d go in there and get your ideas ripped apart.\u201d\n\nNow 61, Henry started his comedy career in 1975, and he has become arguably the UK\u2019s most recognisable comic. But there is a lot the British public don\u2019t know about Henry. In the book, the extent of the racist abuse he received as a young man, not to mention the physical violence at home, is revealed in painful detail. To write it, he looked back into his past, opened up a \u201cpandora\u2019s box\u201d of memories and then began, as he puts it, \u201cto vomit out the chapters\u201d.\n\nThe book ranges from his infancy to until he was a few years into his nascent career. It ends before his marriage to fellow comedian Dawn French in 1984; after 25 years together, they divorced in 2010. The pair have a daughter, Billie, who is in her late 20s. Henry is now in a relationship with the theatre producer and casting director Lisa Makin. When we meet, he has just landed from New York and needs to send her what he calls a \u201cyaaaaaay message\u201d to mark the occasion.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The light entertainer: Lenny Henry on New Faces in 1975\n\nThese days, Henry isn\u2019t considered a child star, but that is exactly what he was. Aged 16 when he made his TV debut, he arrived on our screens dressed in a wide-lapelled suit with an oversized bow tie and was introduced by Derek Hobson \u2013 the host of New Faces \u2013 as \u201ca Dudley lad\u201d. His impressions of Stevie Wonder, Muhammad Ali and Frank Spencer were good enough for him to win the talent competition and thrust him into the world of mid-70s light entertainment. Watching the footage now, it is striking how lanky and awkward and yet incredibly confident he was, suggesting years of practice, which in some ways was true.\n\nThroughout Who Am I, Again?, we see Henry using his comedy to ward off bellicose bullies or honing his short impressions sets in sometimes hostile working men\u2019s clubs. He turned the violence he received at the hands of his mother into a live performance that would eventually help him to buy her a home. But his honesty in revealing this in the autobiography caused friction. \u201cMy family were very sensitive about it,\u201d admits Henry, who had to work especially hard to convince his four older siblings (he is one of seven) of the merits of publishing a book about their difficult home life. \u201cThey all got their manuscripts and they were allowed to express what they felt about it and some of them were a bit weird about chatting about our business in public,\u201d he says. \u201cSome of them said: \u2018Go on, say it.\u2019 So I was encouraged by that.\u201d\n\nBut despite the positive spin, there is a dark frankness to the book, not just when Henry recalls the racism he faced in his youth but, more so, when discussing his mother, Winifred. He puts the violent beatings she gave him down to her own upbringing. \u201cIt\u2019s an inherited violence,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd, you know, everybody hit their kids back then. Teachers backhanded you in the classroom in front of other kids. You got the stick, the cane, the slipper. Your mum beat you at home with a stick or a shoe. And if something happens enough, it becomes routine. I wasn\u2019t the only one.\n\n\u201cCharlie Chaplin used to say that comedy is tragedy plus time,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s true. Because when you\u2019re an eight-year-old kid and a grownup is beating you, all you\u2019re thinking is: \u2018When is this going to stop?\u2019\u201d\n\nYet Henry clearly revered his mother, who died in 1998. She came to Britain in the second wave of Caribbean immigration in 1957 and settled in the Midlands before having an affair, of which Henry was the result. When Henry was 10, his mother told him he had to go and do chores for his \u201cuncle\u201d Bertie in exchange for pocket money. He helped him every Friday for 18 months until he was told that Bertie was his real father, not Winston, the man he had grown up with. Henry says he was ashamed of the truth for years, but wants to \u201cown\u201d it now. \u201cMy story is an immigrant story,\u201d he says. \u201cMy story is of people moving from one country thousands of miles away to another and forming new links, new family and new relationships. And that\u2019s just what it is. It\u2019s not illicit, it\u2019s not salacious in any way. It\u2019s a life thing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Henry, aged 16, with his mother in January 1975, just after his TV debut.

This is the woman who, up to five minutes ago, would backhand me or beat me or whatever, and now she\u2019s calling me Lenny instead of Len.\u201d\n\nSome of this anger may stem from the situations that Henry was put in. He wasn\u2019t just on New Faces, Tiswas, the Saturday-morning children\u2019s television programme, and The Fosters, the UK\u2019s first all-black sitcom; he was also on The Black and White Minstrel Show, a decision that was taken by his family and management. Henry didn\u2019t perform in blackface, as some black comedians \u2013 such as Bert Williams in the early 1900s \u2013 had done, but he was on the same show as acts that would be repulsive to today\u2019s audiences. What does he think of the people who put him in that position? \u201cOf course I have an opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t share it with you. But I do know this: if it\u2019s me, and I\u2019m that person\u2019s parent or guardian, I\u2019m not going to let them be in a minstrel show.\u201d\n\nHenry describes Dudley in the 60s and 70s as a \u201csemi-racist\u201d environment, which seems generous considering the stories recorded in his book. What would be known now as \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d were the best Henry could expect from some of his school friends, who were more likely to beat him up while calling him a \u201ccoon\u201d or a \u201cwog\u201d than to touch his hair without asking. Looking back, Henry wishes that he had been more like the Jamaican boys who met racist epithets and violence with fists and bricks of their own. \u201cI wish my dad or somebody had taught me how to fight and defend myself,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause you\u2019re very vulnerable if you can\u2019t stick up for yourself. I wish I\u2019d fought back and I think that\u2019s now where all the activism comes from. It\u2019s this thing of speaking your mind and not being scared \u2013 and we need to be, because we\u2019re all being embarrassed by a 16-year-old girl from Sweden at the moment.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dressed as Theophilus P Wildebeeste in a sketch from the 1988 Lenny Henry Christmas Show. Photograph: Radio Times/Getty Images\n\nBut being brave and speaking out wasn\u2019t simple in 1975 for a teenage black British comic. Henry was told by managers and peers that the place for \u201cpolitics is in your private life \u2013 you don\u2019t do politics on stage\u201d. It was advice he heeded until he began to call for the entertainment industry to address the systemic racism that he had seen throughout his career. In 2008, Henry made a hard-hitting speech to the Royal Television Society, slamming broadcasters for not doing more to encourage ethnic diversity. In an interview with the Guardian shortly afterwards, he said: \u201cI do not think the media is racist. I do think that, as an industry, we are stuck in terms of providing a support system for black, Asian and ethnic minorities who don\u2019t have a natural way into the industry. It\u2019s bullshit, it needs to change.\u201d It didn\u2019t. So, in 2014, he was louder still, calling out the industry\u2019s terrible record on diversity in a Bafta lecture. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t just hitting the glass ceiling: they are standing on a glass precipice,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently, Henry was one of the prominent Britons of colour who wrote to the BBC to complain about the treatment of Naga Munchetty. The corporation had disciplined her, but not her co-host, Dan Walker, after a discussion about Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cgo home\u201d comments aimed at black and Muslim US senators. Unsurprisingly, there is a weariness to Henry\u2019s voice at having to be discussing these issues again, after years of activism. \u201cIt was so benign, though,\u201d he says of Munchetty\u2019s comments. \u201cI know there are guidelines and you are told to adhere to them. But the thing is, she was on TV with her TV husband having a chat about things. And he asked her how she felt about a certain thing, and she replied, in a benign but truthful way. That was all right. She didn\u2019t kill anybody.\u201d\n\nA decade on from his Royal Television Society speech, Henry seems at a loss as to what can be done to improve equality in the British media and worries about what it might take for change to happen, \u201cnot because we\u2019re forced to by another Grenfell or by another Stephen Lawrence or by another Naga Munchetty. Let\u2019s just say we\u2019re going to do something good because we want to do it, not because we were forced to by some terrible event.\n\n\u201cI had 35 years where I\u2019d never have any meetings like this,\u201d he says, pointing at me \u2013 a black journalist asking him questions. \u201cNever interviewed by somebody like you. Never in a creative meeting with somebody that looked like you.\u201d There was one moment when he thought things were turning; when he walked into makeup on the set of the mid-70s sitcom The Fosters. \u201cThere was a mixed-race head of makeup. And I thought: \u2018Oh, OK, things are changing.\u2019 That never happened again. That was an anomaly. I never met a makeup artist of colour for the next 35 years.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Red nose day: Henry co-founded Comic Relief in 1985. Photograph: Mark Richards/Daily Mail/Rex\n\nHenry is doing his bit to offset some of that imbalance with a new series for Gold \u2013 Lenny Henry\u2019s Race Through Comedy \u2013 in which he tells the mostly forgotten story of black British comedians such as Charlie Williams, the Doncaster standup and former professional football he used to impersonate. He has also been an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s treatment of the Windrush generation, and earlier this year starred in and executive produced Soon Gone, a BBC drama that was, in part, inspired by the scandal, of which he \u201cfelt the sting of injustice\u201d.\n\nOne place that Henry has been able to make a significant impact is with Comic Relief, the charity he co-founded with Richard Curtis in 1985 in response to famine in Ethiopia. Last year, Comic Relief had its effectiveness called into question. In response to pictures posted on Instagram by the documentary maker Stacey Dooley, Tottenham MP David Lammy wrote: \u201cThe world does not need any more white saviours. As I\u2019ve said before, this just perpetuates tired and unhelpful stereotypes.\u201d Lammy added that Comic Relief had \u201cfallen short\u201d of what he called its \u201cpublic duty\u201d to promote racial equality and serve minority communities.\n\nSurely it must have hurt to have something he has been working on for more than 30 years painted as not only outdated but actually counterproductive? Not so, says Henry. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t saying anything that we disagree with. We could have done without it on the day of Comic Relief, but we\u2019ve always been aware of the lack of diversity behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHenry says he has pushed for more black directors and the use of local film crews when shooting takes place in Africa. But he doesn\u2019t accept that Lammy was criticising Comic Relief alone. \u201cDavid was commenting about all the broadcast media,\u201d he says. \u201cHe just happened to pick on us because Comic Relief was out and the optics \u2013 sometimes \u2013 aren\u2019t good.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd we are changing.\u201d Even if the change is not coming quickly enough for some, it is hard to doubt Henry\u2019s sincerity. \u201cWhen, in 100 years\u2019 time, we look back at the way things change, we\u2019ll go: \u2018Wow, that was a snap of a finger.\u2019 But when you\u2019re in the middle of it, change is long. And I think that\u2019s the problem. Things aren\u2019t happening fast enough.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lenny Henry\u2019s autobiography, Who Am I, Again?, is published by Faber (\u00a320).
