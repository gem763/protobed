We believed China wanted to participate in global markets and ultimately become freer and more open.\n\nWe believed all of this because it was our strategy for avoiding potential future conflicts with the massive, ancient and reemerging power. Simply put, if the Chinese leadership evolved away from being an oppressive communist totalitarian dictatorship \u2013 and played by the same rules on the world stage \u2013 we could all get along and mutually benefit.\n\nCHINESE MILITARY OFFICIAL SLAMS US'S FOREIGN POLICY, SAYS \u2018NO ONE AND NO FORCE\u2019 WILL GET IN BEIJING'S WAY\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party, which has had complete control over China since 1949, has allowed us to believe these things because it has been a part of its strategy for consuming, overwhelming and defeating any entity that threatens the ultimate power and control of the party.\n\nAs China\u2019s market opened to the world, many of our businesses (and those of other nations) invested heavily in its enormous economy. And our supply chains became increasingly dependent on cheap Chinese manufacturing and labor.\n\nAt the same time, China\u2019s communist leaders leveraged their markets to incentivize more American investment, subsidized their state-owned industries to create more economic dependence on China, and systematically began stealing foreign knowledge and intellectual property to gain further advantage over industries vital to the modern world economy.\n\nWe now face a serious competitor that does not want to share the world stage \u2013 it wants to dominate and control it.\n\nAs a result, many of our investments have been pilfered, our own traditional industries have been starved out of business by unfair competition, some of our best ideas have been stolen, and virtually every product that is critical to the modern world is made (at least in part) in China.\n\nStill, many in government, the media and academia don\u2019t realize \u2013 or refuse to accept \u2013 that the fantasy is over. We now face a serious competitor that does not want to share the world stage \u2013 it wants to dominate and control it.\n\nLuckily, for the first time in decades, we have a president of the United States who understands the gravity of this competition \u2013 and is working to level the playing field. This is why I wrote \u201cTrump vs. China: Facing America\u2019s Greatest Threat,\u201d which was released Tuesday.\n\nAs I wrote in my book, it is important to understand that I am not describing a competition between Americans and the Chinese people. This is not a fight between cultures or ethnicities. This is a struggle between two competing systems.\n\nThere\u2019s no evidence that the Chinese people as a whole want to undermine our way of life and dominate the world. However, in my new book, I cite a great deal of evidence that the Chinese Communist Party (a totalitarian dictatorship) wants to do exactly that \u2013 and is actively working toward the goal of returning China to its historic place as the Middle Kingdom at the center of global affairs.\n\nThis book is based on facts, not fear.\n\nIt is well-documented that the Chinese Communist Party is instituting a system of censorship, surveillance and control within its own borders.\n\nIt is a fact that right now, more than 1 million Uighur Muslims and other non-Han Chinese ethnic minorities are being held in \u201cre-education camps\u201d in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\nIt is a fact that the Chinese Communist Party is seeking to undermine and eliminate freedoms in Hong Kong, which by law has a right to democratic elections and autonomy from Beijing.\n\nOn Wednesday we saw the Chinese Communist Party-controlled government in Hong Kong attempt to minimize sympathy for pro-democracy protesters by re-announcing it had formally withdrawn the proposed law that sparked months of protests. It had already done this in September.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe are also seeing the Chinese Communist Party begin to test its ability to exercise control in other countries.\n\nFor years, China has ignored international agreements and norms by occupying and militarizing the South China Sea \u2013 to the detriment of all its Southeast Asian neighbors.\n\nWe are also seeing the Chinese Communist Party absorbing property and gaining regional control over poorer countries ensnared in its Belt and Road global infrastructure initiative.\n\nEven in America, consider the recent Beijing-NBA clash when a U.S. team manager expressed support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nBefore that, think about China\u2019s economic attack on Western airlines that had referred to Taiwan and Hong Kong as independent countries.\n\nThese may seem like small things, but they are part of a much larger, long-term plan to overcome and supplant America as the world\u2019s leading superpower.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs I wrote in my book: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s concept of Making America Great Again (and now Keeping America Great) is simply incompatible with General Secretary Xi\u2019s China Dream. One or the other will ultimately define the future of the human race.\u201d\n\nThis is a serious competition. If we lose, America as we know it could be submerged by a totalitarian dictatorship.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY NEWT GINGRICH", "description": "America as we know it could be submerged by a totalitarian dictatorship.", "authors": ["Newt Gingrich", "Former Speaker Of The U.S. House Of Representatives Newt Gingrich Is The Host Of The"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/06_AP19268359157754.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
