The Reason Is Iran", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- This week\u2019s bulletin from the Saudi government congratulated the new Japanese emperor, condemned a truck bombing in Afghanistan and noted discussions with Brazil over intellectual property rights.\n\nConspicuous by its absence was a country where Saudi Arabia has wielded influence for decades and where protests against the political establishment have turned into the stirrings of another Middle East revolution.\n\nThe official silence in the Arab world over the unrest that\u2019s rocked Lebanon for more than a week could have come from Napoleon\u2019s playbook of not interfering when your enemy is in the process of destroying itself. Demonstrators in Beirut and other Lebanese regions have united against a regime dominated by Hezbollah, a proxy of Iran that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries label as terrorist and have long tried to undermine.\n\nOne Gulf official, who declined to be identified by name when talking about sensitive foreign policy, said tight lips are deliberate even as Saudi and other Gulf commentators and television channels salute the protesters. What\u2019s more, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri is being refused financial help to avoid money going to Hezbollah via the government, according to the official and two more people familiar with the matter.\n\nAnger over economic hardship and allegations of corruption have been a hallmark of Lebanon for years. This time, though, politicians of all religions and stripes have been engulfed, including Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who was considered an untouchable icon.\n\nQuicktakeLebanon\u2019s Unrest Unexplained\n\nChants of \u201call of them means all of them\u201d calling for a blanket dismissal of the country\u2019s power brokers have risen from Sunni Muslim hotbeds Tripoli and Akkar in the north, Hezbollah-controlled cities of Baalbek in the east and Nabatiyyeh in the south and mainly Christian areas in central Beirut.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a gift from heaven for Saudi Arabia and other countries in their proxy war with Iran,\u201d said Sami Nader, head of the Levant Institute in Beirut. Keeping out of it, though, is key, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Hezbollah is the first loser here so any sign there\u2019s a regional power trying to hijack the movement will polarize the protest and divide it along sectarian lines.\u201d\n\nLike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have also refrained from issuing official statements or the usual pleas for calm, limiting their actions to evacuating their citizens from Lebanon.\n\nThe three monarchies have until recently been key in providing bailouts and financial help when Lebanon\u2019s economy teetered on the brink of collapse. Lebanon is one of the most indebted countries in the world, and its attempts before the protests began to get fresh sources of funding have floundered.\n\nPrime Minister Hariri visited Abu Dhabi a few weeks ago and got no support, the Gulf official said. By contrast, when unrest broke out in Sudan and its leader was toppled, the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia pledged $3 billion to head off any chaos.\n\nThe Gulf allies largely stood on the sidelines over Lebanon for two key reasons, the people familiar with their strategy said. Hariri has not carried out any of the reforms demanded by donors to begin releasing money pledged at a conference in 2018 and Hezbollah\u2019s entrenched influence, they said.\n\n\u201cIn a way, you bail out Lebanon, you bail out Hezbollah,\u201d said Shafeeq Ghabra, a political science professor at Kuwait University.\n\nThe militant group is Iran\u2019s biggest success at exporting the 1979 Islamic Revolution. It has mobilized thousands of men to fight Israel and, more recently, mainly Sunni rebels in Syria.\n\nAt home in Lebanon, it\u2019s more powerful than the U.S.-equipped army. The organization also has a network of charities providing social aid and affordable health care that its Shiite supporters benefit from. It won its first legislative seat in Sunni-dominated Beirut in 2018 as Hariri, the pro-Saudi Sunni premier, failed to curb its influence. He was brought to Riyadh to face Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman later that year.\n\nNasrallah urged protesters on Oct. 19 to express their opinions politely, adding with a smile, \u201cCurse me, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d In a veiled threat to Hariri and his allies, Nasrallah said those who try to flee their responsibilities after years in power should be put on trial.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- This week\u2019s bulletin from the Saudi government congratulated the new Japanese emperor, condemned a truck bombing in Afghanistan and noted discussions with Brazil over intellectual property rights.Conspicuous by its absence was a country where Saudi Arabia has wielded influence for decades", "authors": ["Donna Abu-Nasr", "Fiona Macdonald", "Alaa Shahine"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fjqxID7ZlqKRlUWpx0nuNQ--~B/aD05ODY7dz0xNDgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f40cfc81e43c0fc78b34dfe09006609b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
