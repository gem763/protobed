It is the rough transcript of the Ukraine conversation that the White House initially parked in a classified computer system but released after the call was exposed by a whistleblower. A common-sense reading of that text reveals a president of the United States involved in a politically motivated shakedown of a foreign leader.\n\nThis is a quid pro quo. It is a corrupt quid pro quo. It is a proven quid pro quo.
