Bishop had 50.8% of the vote to McCready\u2019s 48.8% as of late Tuesday evening, with 99% of precincts reporting.\n\nBishop is perhaps best known for co-sponsoring the state\u2019s \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, which forced transgender people to use restrooms that matched the gender listed on their birth certificates in state-owned buildings. The law was repealed after it prompted a national outcry and boycotts.\n\nThe contest in a usually reliably Republican seat had attracted national attention, including several campaign visits by Trump himself, and had increasingly been seen by Republicans and Democrats alike as a proxy battle for next year\u2019s race for the White House. Republicans had dumped at least $20m into the ninth district race in a bid to save the seat from going blue.\n\nThe election caps a months-long political scandal, in which allegations of ballot tampering in the 2018 midterms forced state officials to void the results and order a fresh election.\n\nAbsentee-ballot fraud scandal speaks to wider issue of racism in North Carolina Read more\n\nAt the time McCready lost the congressional district by just 905 votes to the then-Republican candidate, Mark Harris. However within days it emerged \u201cballot harvesters\u201d had been hired by a political operative, to pick up absentee ballots in Bladen county. Some of those ballots never turned up.\n\nThe operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless, was arrested and charged in February after grand jury indictments alleged the illegal possession of absentee ballots and obstruction of justice\n\nThe race was seen as a sign of Trump\u2019s popularity \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 in key districts he easily carried in 2016. The president won the ninth district by 11 points back in 2016\u2019s general election and its loss will be seen as a portent that Republicans are losing support in previously reliable heartland districts. Republicans have held the seat since John F Kennedy was president in 1963.\n\nThe race also gained notoriety in July when Trump staged a rally for Bishop in Greenville. Trump said four Democratic women of color should \u201cgo back\u201d to their home countries, though all but one was born in the US. The crowd began chanting \u201csend her back\u201d, and Trump did not try to stop them, triggering an anguished national debate over racism.\n\nTrump held another rally in North Carolina on Monday and threw his weight behind Bishop in a tweet on Thursday.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) NORTH CAROLINA, VOTE FOR DAN BISHOP TODAY. WE NEED HIM BADLY IN WASHINGTON!\n\nSpecial elections generally attract such low turnout that their results aren\u2019t predictive of general elections, especially in presidential years. Even so, Tuesday\u2019s vote was scrutinized for signals about GOP erosion, particularly among women and college-educated people who have abandoned Trump in droves over his conservative social policies and vitriolic rhetoric on immigration and race.\n\nTrump will need to stem his erosion in suburbs to ensure that his solid support from his rural and conservative, diehard loyalists is sufficient for him to carry swing states in the Midwest and elsewhere like Arizona and North Carolina. He won North Carolina by less than four percentage points in 2016.\n\nThe election between McCready and Bishop was not the only House race in the state on Tuesday. In the third congressional district, where a seat was left open after congressman Walter B Jones Jr died in February, the Republican Greg Murphy, a physician, decisively defeated his Democratic opponent Allen Thomas.\n\nMaanvi Singh and agencies contributed reporting", "description": "Contest in a usually reliably Republican seat had been seen as a proxy battle for next year\u2019s race for the White House", "authors": ["Joan E Greve"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdb2bc971e38b22edb6bc62a16033c96a2205072/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4fd125cec73051458f8e30f5813b95a8", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
