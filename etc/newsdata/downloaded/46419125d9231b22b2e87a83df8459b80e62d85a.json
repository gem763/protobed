Elaine G. Luria had quietly supported her party\u2019s priorities on gun control, advocated for veterans\u2019 rights and kept focused on her conservative Norfolk, Virginia, district rather than seeking the national spotlight \u2014 and then she jumped onto the impeachment train.\n\nAll eyes turned to the former Navy commander last week when she and six other freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds came out in support of an official impeachment inquiry targeting President Trump.\n\nMs. Luria and other moderates helped \u201ctip the scales\u201d on impeachment, said Jennifer N. Victor, a politics professor at George Mason University.\n\n\u201cThese were not like the liberal stalwarts. They were freshmen. They weren\u2019t just following party leadership or party lines,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of them come from moderate districts. And so the fact that that group was coming out very publicly and saying \u2018Nope. We\u2019ve changed our minds. This is really serious now\u2019 really began to turn the tide.\u201d\n\nIt also put them in Republican crosshairs.\n\nMs. Luria and other moderate Democrats backing impeachment are feeling the heat from conservative groups back home, complicating their reelection bids and giving Republicans hope for winning back seats lost in 2018 and retaking the House majority in 2020.\n\n\u201cLuria is now pushing a radical scheme to impeach President Trump, dividing the country, tearing us apart \u2014 because she doesn\u2019t like the president,\u201d said an ad from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to winning a Republican House majority.\n\nThe group released similar ads targeting Democratic Reps. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania. The ads tied the three moderate lawmakers to well-known liberal Democrats such as Sen. Bernard Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\n\nThe super PAC accused Rep. Abigail Davis Spanberger, Virginia Democrat, of backtracking. It cited an article in which she explained that her party needed to walk a fine line between investigating and rushing toward impeachment.\n\n\u201cDemocrats in Congress have made it clear that the left\u2019s crazed drive to remove Trump from office is far more important to them than improving the lives of their constituents,\u201d Congressional Leadership Fund President Dan Conston said in a statement.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry stems from a whistleblower complaint that Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate corruption involving 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nDemocrats accuse Mr. Trump of using Oval Office power for his personal benefit. The White House says the request was for a legitimate investigation.\n\nHouse Democrats, particularly those in vulnerable districts, should expect Republicans to keep hammering them on the issue.\n\n\u201cImpeachment shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s thrown around as a political chip like the Democrats are doing,\u201d Chris Pack, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told The Washington Times. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to cost them their majority in 2020.\u201d\n\nThe Republican campaign attacks not only zero in on Democrats\u2019 \u201cobsession\u201d with impeachment but also on how it holds up their legislative agenda, he said.\n\nMr. Pack expects the impeachment message to be effective in the 55 districts where the NRCC has put its focus, 31 of which Mr. Trump won in 2016.\n\nRepublicans have started digital campaigns in 16 competitive districts targeting lawmakers such as Ms. Slotkin, Mr. Cartwright, Ms. Spanberger and Ms. Luria.\n\n\u201cA lot of these freshman Democrats, especially in the Trump districts that Trump won, they ran almost as moderate Republicans,\u201d Mr. Pack said. \u201cNow we\u2019re seeing that was a bunch of empty rhetoric.\n\n\u201cNow you\u2019re seeing this hatred of President Trump \u2026 applies to a large majority of their conference,\u201d he added.\n\nRepublican political consultant Karl Rove said the impeachment rush came with big risks for Democrats.\n\n\u201cIn the short run, they are going to be on a sugar high and they are going to feel good about themselves,\u201d he said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cHannity\u201d program. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that of the 19 Democrats who won seats in 2018 in districts that Donald Trump carried by 4 points or more, 10 of them have not yet endorsed the inquiry.\n\n\u201cIf they lose 17 or 18 seats, they could lose control of the House by the time of the 2020 election,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the competitive race ahead of her, Ms. Luria said she has no regrets about her decision.\n\n\u201cThe voters in my district sent me here to do what is right. \u2026 I think I\u2019m paid to be a member of Congress and make hard decisions,\u201d she told reporters last week. \u201cIf it has consequences in the future, so be it.\u201d\n\nMs. Luria announced she would hold a town hall Thursday evening and extended an invitation on Twitter to Scott Taylor, the Republican whose seat she now holds, after he said she owes her constituents an explanation.\n\nMs. Slotkin said the party needs to have a clear, cohesive communication plan in order to sway public opinion.\n\n\u201cI think if we have a good strategic plan, then the folks who are focused on impeachment will move out and the folks who are supposed to be focused on everything else \u2014 a transportation bill, prescription drug legislation \u2014 they will work just as hard at that legislation and pushing that forward as the folks who are focused on impeachment,\u201d she told reporters last week.\n\n\u201cIt is our job to do the best we possibly can on both oversight and affirmative legislation,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
