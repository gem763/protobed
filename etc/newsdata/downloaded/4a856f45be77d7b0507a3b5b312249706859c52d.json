(I can't legally hire a team and own more than 10% of a company on a tier 2 visa). I now must raise \u00a3200k by the end of August,' she added. 'Otherwise I am forced to go back to California.'\n\nRecords appear to show Ms Arcuri, an American citizen, stayed in the UK for five months after she wrote the email.\n\nMs Arcuri, now 34, is pictured with Boris Johnson during his Back Boris London Mayor campaign of 2012\n\nIt was during that time, The Sunday Times claims, she was given \u00a310,000 by London & Partners, the Mayor of London agency dedicated to promoting the capital.\n\nMr Johnson and Ms Arcuri became friends in 2012 after they met on his campaign trail for London Mayor in 2012.\n\nIt has been claimed they had a relationship, but Ms Arcuri told the Mail this weekend she was 'Boris's Anne Boleyn' because Henry VIII was driven 'crazy' when she would not 'give him her virtue'. Mr Johnson also denies they were romantically involved.\n\nShe is believed to have stopped working for Title X soon after acquiring her tier teo employment visa.\n\nThe company, owned by former UBS and Citibank banker Tom Hayes, later jailed for his involved in the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal, went out of business mid 2013.\n\nBy then Ms Arcuri had already started her own business, the Innotech Network, which is set to have benefited from \u00a310,000 London Mayor funding at the heart of the recent scandal.\n\nThe pair are pictured together in London in 2014. Both deny they had a relationship\n\nMs Arcuri told the Sunday Times she did not want to comment, while Mr Johnson continues to deny any impropreity.\n\nMs Arcuri, who now lives in her native California, told the Mail she did not have a relationship with the now-Prime Minister as she knew she would be 'cast out' as a result.\n\nShe said: 'I was categorically clear that the moment I gave Boris my virtue, I would be cast out. That's why I made him my buddy. I would say things like: 'You don't want me, I'm high maintenance and very demanding.'\n\n'He used to laugh and say: 'I don't believe that at all.'\n\nShe went on to claim Mr Johnson described her as 'every man's Everest'.\n\nShe said: 'He would say: 'Jennifer, you're the Mount Everest every man wants to climb.'\n\n'But the last thing I wanted to be was the girl that showed up, sh***ed him and left.'", "description": "Jennifer Arcuri entered the UK on a student visa in 2011 to do a one-year MBA in London.
