REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\nIf Johnson loses, he may be compelled to recall parliament earlier than scheduled, giving additional time for legislators to scrutinize and oppose his plans to lead Britain out of the European Union, with or without a divorce deal, on Oct. 31.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling could come late on Thursday at the earliest, but is more likely to be delivered in the following days. The 11 justices have given no indication of how long they would take.\n\nBefore the suspension, Johnson suffered one defeat after another in parliament, where he has no majority. Most members of the House of Commons are opposed to a so-called \u201cno-deal Brexit\u201d scenario, predicting that it would cause economic damage and severe disruption, including to food and medicine supply chains.\n\nThe hearing in the Supreme Court stems from Johnson\u2019s decision to ask Queen Elizabeth to prorogue, or suspend, parliament from Sept. 10 to Oct. 14, on the grounds that he needed the time to prepare a new legislative agenda.\n\nJohnson\u2019s opponents contend that the real reason why he sought the suspension was to prevent parliament from interfering with his Brexit strategy, and therefore that he unlawfully misled the sovereign with his advice.\n\nUnder Britain\u2019s complex, uncodified constitution, parliament is sovereign, although the exact scope of that sovereignty has been subject to legal debate during the Supreme Court hearing.\n\nLawyers representing the prime minister told the court during the two previous days of hearings that the dispute over the suspension was a political issue, not a matter for judges, and that Johnson\u2019s purpose was not improper.\n\nThey also signaled that if he lost the case, he could ask the queen to recall parliament. However, they gave little clarity as to exactly how or when that would happen and what else the prime minister might do.\n\nOn Thursday, the court will hear arguments from lawyers representing various people and bodies who are not parties to the legal dispute but whose views are considered relevant and important. They include the semi-autonomous governments of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\n\nThere will also be an intervention on behalf of John Major, a former prime minister whose years in office between 1990 and 1997 were marked by bitter divisions and conflict within his own Conservative Party over Britain\u2019s relations with the EU.\n\nJohnson is also a Conservative prime minister, and the party is more divided than ever over the EU issue.\n\nMajor, who famously described some of his own anti-EU cabinet members as \u201cbastards\u201d, has argued vigorously that Britain should remain in the EU and has warned that a no-deal Brexit would be disastrous for the nation.
