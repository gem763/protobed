An accomplished crossover artist, she represented Sweden at the 2009 Eurovision Song Contest, singing \"La voix.\"\n\nEventually, her daughter's activism convinced Ernman to curb her performances abroad due concerns of the climate effects of aviation.\n\nBelow, two of Erman's performances: First, Nerone's aria, \"Come nube che fugge dal vento,\" from Act 3 of Handel's Agrippina. Then, Dido's Lament from Purcell's Dido and Aeneas.", "description": "Watch the Swedish mezzo-soprano sing arias by Handel and Purcell.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5298296.1569514978!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/malena-ernman-mezzo-soprano.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
