But it was far from a success as the Vikings regressed from a 13-3 division winner without him to an 8-7-1 team watching the playoffs from home last season.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s inept offensive outing in a 16-6 loss to the Chicago Bears to fall to 2-2, it\u2019s fair to question if signing Cousins was a critical misstep. In doing so, the answer becomes clear.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSigning Kirk Cousins was a mistake\n\nWhen looking at one of the NFL\u2019s best defenses alongside high-level skill talent in running back Dalvin Cook and wide receivers Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs, one doesn\u2019t have to look hard to find the weak link on the field in Minnesota.\n\nCousins isn\u2019t the answer.\n\nJust ask Thielen, who didn\u2019t hold back in calling out his quarterback after Sunday\u2019s loss.\n\nAdam Thielen didn't hold back in criticizing Kirk Cousins. (Reuters)\n\nThielen\u2019s harsh words for Cousins\n\n\u201cAt some point, you're not going to be able to run the ball for 180 yards, even with the best running back in the NFL,\u201d Thielen told reporters, per The Athletic. \u201cThat's when you have to be able to throw the ball. ... You have to be able to hit the deep balls.\u201d\n\nThose are not the words of a man who has faith in his quarterback. They\u2019re the words of a man who\u2019s long been frustrated with the man running his offense.\n\nAt first glance, Cousins\u2019 day against the Bears \u2014 in typical Cousins form \u2014 didn\u2019t look terrible on the stat sheet. He completed 75 percent of his passes for 233 yards without an interception.\n\nCousins repeatedly wilts in pressure of big play\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was just impotent. And a deeper look at the box score reveals the flaws. He failed to find the end zone. He took six sacks. He fumbled twice, losing one in the red zone. He averaged 6.5 yards per attempt.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nHe couldn\u2019t hit the big play, despite being surrounded by big-play talent.\n\nHe missed a big third-down throw in the first half to Thielen from midfield that could have gone for a touchdown.\n\nCousins with plenty of time..overthrows an open thielen for a td..feels like we\u2019ve had a lot of these this season #Vikings https://t.co/3IapxfHL39 \u2014 SKskolReport (@SKOLreportSK) September 30, 2019\n\n\u201cHe made a great read of finding me open, and just didn't complete the pass,\u201d Thielen said. \u201cIt's as simple as that.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, Cousins owned the mistake.\n\n\u201cYeah, it's a throw I want back,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYeah, you want to hit that one for sure.\u201d\n\nBut Cousins\u2019 job isn\u2019t to admit mistakes. It\u2019s to avoid these kinds of missed opportunities in the first place.\n\nThe defense is there. The skill players are there. The problem in Minnesota clearly resides under center. (Getty)\n\nCousins\u2019 critical mistake vs. Packers\n\nIt\u2019s not the first big missed opportunity against a division rival for Cousins this season.\n\nWith a chance to take a late lead against the Packers in Week 2, he threw an inexcusable end-zone interception that sealed a victory for Green Bay.\n\nFacing pressure on first-and-goal late in the fourth quarter, he floated a pass off his back foot up for grabs to the back of the end zone.\n\nPackers cornerback Kevin King came down with it. It was the worst-case scenario on a first-down play that should have ended with a throw out of the back of the end zone to give his offense three more chances. Instead, the Packers held on for the 21-16 victory. Cousins finished the day completing 14 of 32 pass attempts for 230 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nCousins doesn\u2019t fare well against good teams\n\nThat result, like Sunday\u2019s against the Bears, was typical of Cousins, who regularly fades in big moments. With Sunday\u2019s loss, Cousins falls to 4-27 in the NFL against teams with winning records. For every \u201cYou like that!\u201d moment, there are half a dozen working against Cousins\u2019 favor.\n\nGranted, wins and loss don\u2019t fall completely on quarterbacks, and Cousins wasn\u2019t surrounded by the highest level of talent in six seasons as the quarterback of the Washington Redskins.\n\nBut the Vikings \u2014 in full-fledged win-now mode \u2014 paid him like a difference maker in signing him to his record fully guaranteed $84 million deal.\n\nHe\u2019s not a difference maker. He wasn\u2019t in Washington, where the Redskins never eclipsed nine wins during his tenure.\n\nAnd he\u2019s the antithesis of one in Minnesota, where he is surrounded by top talent that fared better without him.\n\nAdam Thielen is fed up with Kirk Cousins. (Getty)\n\nWhat do the Vikings do?\n\nIf Cousins\u2019 first season with the Vikings \u2014 where he completed 70 percent of his passes for 4,298 yards with 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions for a team that missed the playoffs \u2014 was disappointing, Year 2 is shaping up to be ugly.\n\nPrior to Sunday\u2019s ineffective game, Cousins connected on 58.7 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and two interceptions for 502 yards.\n\nOver the long run of the season, Cousins is likely to see an uptick in those numbers as he levels out to the good-but-not great stats that convinced the Vikings to hang their Super Bowl hopes on his right arm. Also, he won\u2019t be playing the Bears and Packers defenses every week.\n\nCan they bench Cousins?\n\nEven that prospect begs the question: Should there be a long run this season for Cousins?\n\nWith lifetime backup Sean Mannion and his career 66.4 quarterback rating, the answer \u2014 unfortunately for Thielen and Vikings fans \u2014 is yes. Barring some outside-the-box personnel thinking, there isn\u2019t a viable option for Minnesota not named Cousins.\n\nThat leaves the Vikings hoping that Cousins will find the big-play touch that has largely alluded him during seven-plus seasons as an NFL quarterback. It\u2019s unlikely.\n\nAlready trailing the Packers and Bears in the standings, and in head-to-head matchups, the Vikings face an uphill battle to make the playoffs. If they don\u2019t make the postseason for a second straight year, it will most certainly be time to park the final year of that $84 million on the bench in search of a quarterback who can harness the short window of success the talent in Minnesota presents.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The defense is there.
