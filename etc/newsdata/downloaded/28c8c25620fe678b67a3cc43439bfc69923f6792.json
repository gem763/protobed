But we were comfortable because we knew it would take a while. Mind you, I didn\u2019t think it would take quite a year. But these deals are just complex, with a lot of things to work through, structure, valuation and then you get the lawyers in the room.\u201d\n\nGiven the complexities ahead, it is a fair bet that Gallagher and his M &A crew will be spending a fair bit more time yet with those lawyers.\n\nPart of the supporting narrative of the DLNG deal is that it liberates two joint ventures to better align the ownership of the legacy infrastructure business and that of the next big gas development that will feed it. The corollary of that objective is that there are a few more trades to happen yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext trick: the sell-down\n\nAt completion of the ConocoPhillips deal, Santos will temporarily own 68.4 per cent of the legacy projects and 62.5 per cent of the Barossa-Caldita gas resource that is the subject of plans for a $US4.7 billion development whose final investment decision is expected next year.\n\nHaving leapt from second or third-tier owner in each project, Santos will become operator of old and new. The plan is to retain that shaping position but to trim the ownership of DLNG and Barossa-Caldita to something nearer 40 per cent.\n\nSantos arrived at this deal with the DLNG-side of that pruning already organised with a letter of intent signed with SK of Korea that will see it take 25 per cent of the LNG facility and Bayu-Undan.\n\nUntil Monday SK was the second-biggest owner of the Barossa-Caldita project with 37.5 per cent. Given Gallagher\u2019s pitch on alignment, it would seem to be a fair bet that SK too will move to trim its place in the now Santos-operated expansion project.\n\nAccording to Gallagher, Santos continues in productive conversation about ownership alignment with the other investors in DLNG. There are four other owners, three Japanese companies and one Italian. They are Inpex (11.4 per cent), ENI (11 per cent), JERA (6.1 per cent) and the half-owner of the world\u2019s biggest LNG buyer, Tokyo Gas (3.1 per cent).\n\nSantos expects that the SK deal, along with the ownership tinkering that will follow, should allow it to very promptly reduce gearing from the 35 per cent it will reach on deal close to something nearing its through-the-cycle target of 25-30 per cent.\n\nJust on debt, Gallagher expressed three reasons why shareholders should be confident and comfortable with another debt-funded deal that takes the total transaction toll over the past 14 months to $US3.5 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReasons for trust\n\nFirst, Santos continues to generate strong cash flow through a period of relatively soft oil and gas prices. Second, the Quadrant deal stands a proof-point of the capacity of the company\u2019s balance sheet and management ability to digest a major transaction. And finally, the level of debt required to complete the ConocoPhillips deal will be nothing like the headline numbers in the transaction.\n\nThat is because of the SK transaction and because the cash flows generated since January will be allocated on the new ownership structure.\n\nSo, in the end, the funding requirement is expected to range between $US775 million and $US825 million. As a result Santos, which has $US1.2 billion in cash on hand, has secured itself a $US750, two-year acquisition facility.\n\nAs you might imagine, Gallagher insisted that the prudence learnt through the collision of the ramp-up of the company\u2019s Gladstone LNG project with the 2015 oil price crisis still guides investment hands at Santos. His business will not excessively stretch its balance sheet, he promised.\n\nThe really fascinating product of Gallagher\u2019s push on DLNG is how it leaves Santos as the gatekeeper of so much latent and future opportunity in Australian gas.\n\nAs things stand, DLNG is a one-train project with capacity of 3.7 million tonnes and a bank of contracted customers, a lot of whom will likely want to extend their connections by signing up to take Barossa-Caldita gas.\n\nBut, as Gallagher noted several times on Monday, the project carries approvals for three trains and he believes there is gas enough to the north, west and south of Darwin to create a 10mtpa export hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo the north and west, Santos lists the relatively proximate Petrel-Tern-Frigate fields that total 2.6 trillion cubic feet of gas (about half the size of the Barossa-Caldita accumulation. Santos also owns a lead share of 2.8TCF of gas in the Browse Basin, a package of four fields that includes the Crown and Lasseter finds. And there is the more distant 2.1TCF Poseidon resource.\n\nNot just offshore\n\nEven more intriguing is the potential offered by the deep onshore shales of the Northern Territory\u2019s MacArthur Basin. Santos is set to start drilling in the MacArthur and just last week Origin Energy re-opened its shale exploration campaign in the adjacent Beetaloo Basin.\n\nSantos\u2019 share of the NT shales is expected to generate dry gas while there is informed hope that Origin\u2019s play will produce liquids as well. But, either way, the most likely exit-point for shale discoveries of any scale has always been Darwin.\n\nAnother of the points that Gallagher made over and again through the opening phase of his deal marketing was that the ownership of any future Darwin LNG trains could be quite different to that of the foundation project.\n\nTo my mind this observation demonstrates the level of optionality that Santos has acquired in assuming ConocoPhillips' standing as the operator of DLNG.\n\nThere is reason to imagine, for example, that if the potential of the MacArthur-Beetaloo plays out as hoped, then Santos and Origin, along with some big gas customers, might share ownership of an expansion train at DLNG.\n\nJust while we are enjoying a bit of harmless speculation, another NT exploration project that will be worth keeping a weather eye on over the longer term is the Santos-operated Dukas wildcat in the Southern Amadeus Basin.\n\nDukas was drilled through July and August of this year and generated encouragement and frustration in almost equal measure. Drilling produced indications of hydrocarbons but ultimately the work had to be suspended because the formation pressures were assessed to be too high for the rig deployed to do the drilling.\n\nIt seems likely that Santos will not return to Dukas until 2021. But if the play works to its currently assessed potential, then it could well justify being connected to the east coast network through Moomba. And that, folks, makes it a possible game changer for the east coast markets.", "description": "The $2.2 billion Darwin deal with ConocoPhillips stamps Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher as arguably the boldest operator in the Australian gas industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_139/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9d86bb8a74fa2502c8cd3e689687292df9257bf1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
