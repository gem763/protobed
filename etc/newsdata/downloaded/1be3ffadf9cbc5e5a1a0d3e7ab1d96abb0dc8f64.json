If there\u2019s one football manager synonymous with ranting on the sidelines at players and officials, it\u2019s the fiery Scotsman. This picture of Fergie was shot during a first division match against Luton in October 1987, less than a year after he joined Manchester United. At that point in time, he had every reason to chastise his players: old, unfit and too keen on booze, many of them were soon shipped out of the club and, over time, replaced with young academy prospects, precipitating the greatest period of domestic dominance in the Premier League era. Ferguson claimed 38 trophies at United \u2013 including 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two Champions Leagues. By the time of his retirement in 2013, everyone from David Beckham to Cristiano Ronaldo could attest to the fury of Fergie\u2019s so-called \u2018hairdryer treatment\u2019.\n\nPhotograph: Mark Leech/Offside\n\nWords: Jonny Weeks\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a355 including delivery\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are 30x40cm and presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.
