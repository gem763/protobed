I mean, that\u2019s not \u2014 that\u2019s probably a plant that has thousands of workers. You know, this is not like a strike or, you know, the kind of historic strikes that we\u2019ve known or used to be accustomed to.\u201d\n\nThe Lordstown plant shown in the video is actually an unallocated plant, which ceased production in March. According to local news station WKBN, the UAW strikers would be taking six-hour shifts to protest outside each entrance of the plant beginning at midnight Sunday due to an agreement by union members to strike outside all GM facilities.\n\nPayne went on to say that, with \u201cGM losing $100 million a day and striking workers making 200 bucks a day, who can hold out the longest? This is, I think, really a tough one for the UAW leadership to continue to get its workers riled up about.\u201d\n\nThough the strike is estimated to be costing GM $100 million a day in lost operating income, workers are receiving $250 a week (not $200 a day) in strike pay, which is close to the poverty threshold.\n\nGM and auto workers nationwide are striking indefinitely over pay, job security and health benefits, and more than 50 facilities across the country have ceased operation as a result.\n\nThe union has a strike fund of more than $700 million, which is being used to provide workers with strike pay and health coverage.\n\nFox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "There are almost 50,000 United Auto Workers on strike, making it the largest auto strike in a decade.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d818a1a3b00002b88d6b00d.png?cache=dzjwtid0sg&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
