Turley\n\nWhat do a 19th-century Catholic convert and 20th-century college student have in common?\n\nA lot, if their names are Newman and Scholl \u2014 for Sophie Scholl, the young German woman who 76 years ago lost her life resisting the Nazis, was influenced by the writings and witness of soon-to-be St. John Henry Newman.\n\n\u201cSophie Scholl was deeply moved by Newman\u2019s Parochial and Plain Sermons,\u201d explained Father Dermot Fenlon, whose groundbreaking essay on the connection between Newman and the White Rose movement appeared in the German journal Newman Studien (2010).\n\nThe White Rose was a nonviolent, intellectual resistance group. It comprised mainly students at the University of Munich, who, from June 27, 1942, onwards organized an anonymous leaflet and graffiti campaign calling for active opposition to the Nazi regime. The Gestapo arrested the leaders of the White Rose group on Feb. 18, 1943; show trials followed, as well as prison and execution for those implicated.\n\nSophie Scholl and her brother, Hans, were the leaders in this student resistance. In organizing acts of subversion against the Third Reich, they were motivated in part by the experience of a war being fought without hope of victory and in part by a reaction to the suppression of conscience and thought by the Nazis.\n\nFather Fenlon\u2019s interest in the connection between Newman and the Scholls had been sparked by the pioneering work of Jakob Knab, the historian of the White Rose movement. Speaking to the Register, Father Fenlon said: \u201cI am of the opinion that [in regard to the White Rose movement] the essential influence of Newman is found in the person of Sophie Scholl and that his influence did not extend to the subsequent attempt of the White Rose movement to spark a student revolt issuing in a disastrous termination.\u201d\n\nNewman and the White Rose\n\nSpeaking to the Register, Ryan Marr, director of the National Institute for Newman Studies and associate editor of the Newman Studies Journal, said that Newman\u2019s influence on Scholl is clear: \u201cI think that Newman\u2019s writings played a significant role in the development of Sophie Scholl\u2019s thoughts on resistance to totalitarianism.\u201d\n\nThis is a view also shared by scholar Paul Shrimpton, who has researched and published on Newman\u2019s life and thought. His latest book is Conscience Before Conformity: Hans and Sophie Scholl and the White Rose Resistance in Nazi Germany (2018). Speaking of Scholl and her fellow resisters, Shrimpton told the Register: \u201cThere is no doubt that Newman was one of the \u2018Christian sages\u2019 who [through his writings] was able to respond to the students\u2019 need to make sense of the moral chaos around them.\u201d He added: \u201cNewman\u2019s words provided much-needed relief for their spiritual and intellectual hunger.\u201d Before discovering Newman, they had read the works of St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Pascal and the leading writers of the French journal Renouveau Catholique, such as Georges Bernanos, L\u00e9on Bloy and Paul Claudel, but Shrimpton maintains \u201cthat they were [most] strongly influenced by Newman.\u201d\n\nThe future White Rose members were intellectually formed under the direction of Theodor Haecker, a philosopher who had become a Catholic after translating Newman\u2019s Grammar of Assent in 1921. It was through Haecker that the Scholls were first introduced to Newman\u2019s works.\n\nFollowing the rise of Hitler, Haecker was banned from speaking in public or writing under his own name. Thereafter, his resistance to the Nazi regime was undertaken through cultural resistance, and in particular by translating the works of Newman into German.\n\nShrimpton sees Haecker as the mentor for Sophie and Hans. The most dramatic experience of the influence of Haecker, and of Newman, came on Dec. 13, 1942. Haecker read to the Scholls from his draft translation of Newman\u2019s four Advent sermons on \u201cThe Patristical Idea of Antichrist.\u201d This was the pivotal text for Haecker\u2019s thesis on understanding Christianity in the Third Reich. \u201cTo judge from diary entries and letters of those present, [that reading] was a life-changing occasion for them,\u201d Shrimpton says. \u201cThe fourth White Rose leaflet was written the day after the students had attended another secret meeting with dissident academics and intellectuals at which Haecker was the main speaker; and the leaflet echoes his voice and, in places, Newman\u2019s too.\u201d\n\nIn 1942 Sophie Scholl gave two volumes of Newman\u2019s sermons as a parting gift to her boyfriend, Fritz Hartnagel, when he was sent to the Eastern Front. Marr told the Register: \u201cAmidst the chaos of the Eastern Front, Fritz wrote to Scholl, describing Newman\u2019s writings as being like \u2018drops of precious wine.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanctity of Conscience\n\nIn particular, it seems Hartnagel, and indeed others in the White Rose, were drawn to Newman\u2019s thoughts on conscience. In his \u201cLetter to the Duke of Norfolk\u201d (1875), Newman described conscience as \u201cthe aboriginal vicar of Christ,\u201d meaning that it was the first way in which we hear the voice of God speaking to us. Although the idea is sometimes misunderstood today, Newman also believed in the primacy of conscience. \u201cIn Fritz [Hartnagel\u2019s] letters, and in the activities of the White Rose movement more generally, you see how there was an intentionality about being attentive to conscience as a way of evaluating the merits of what the governing authorities were asking of the German citizenry,\u201d Marr explained, going on to say that Newman is clear that Christians are never compelled to follow a command that runs contrary to the objective moral law: \u201cNewman\u2019s nuanced treatment of the role of conscience in the moral life provided the members of the White Rose resistance with the tools necessary to articulate reasons why their refusal to obey Hitler was not only a legitimate option, but morally obligatory.\u201d\n\nThe resistance of Sophie and Hans led to their deaths. Both were executed by guillotine on Feb. 22, 1943; Hans was 24 years old, and Sophie was only 21. It is not widely known that, one hour before their executions, both Scholls asked to be received into the Catholic Church. The Lutheran prison chaplain dissuaded them from doing so, however, out of sensitivity to their grieving and profoundly devout Lutheran parents. Sophie was guillotined first. As Hans was led next to his death, he cried out: \u201cLong live freedom!\u201d When Sophie\u2019s boyfriend Hartnagel returned from the front he visited Sophie\u2019s parents to extend his condolences. On leaving he gave them a collection of Newman sermons translated by Haecker.\n\nNewman Today\n\nJust as for Sophie Scholl and the White Rose, Shrimpton sees a profound relevance in Newman\u2019s thought and writings for today\u2019s youth. It challenges, he explains, prevailing orthodoxies: \u201cTo read Newman complacently, in order to find only what confirms our existing way of thinking and feeling, is to miss the profoundly interpersonal challenge which he intends,\u201d Shrimpton says. Today, too, he suggests, the challenge of Newman\u2019s influence will \u201csurprise or even upset us. Because Newman inhabits the same modernity as ourselves, he speaks to our own time in ways that can inform and transform us. This influence unites intellectual, moral and spiritual considerations in ways which are inseparable from the call to conversion.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Father Fenlon sees Newman, with his explicit call to conversion to Christ, coming to the aid of society caught up today in the effects and ideology of another revolution: \u201cToday, in the aftermath of the sexual revolution, Newman\u2019s teaching on chastity and celibacy in religious and lay life, his own fidelity to the vocation of purity and holy virginity, constitutes the ground of his significance for the Church and the world at large.\u201d\n\nMarr, too, argues that Newman\u2019s work is an antidote to some of the most serious errors of our own day \u2014 most notably, perhaps, our culture\u2019s drift into relativism. \u201cWhereas in our time many assume that morality \u2014 how one lives one\u2019s life \u2014 is a matter of personal opinion, Newman was a vociferous critic of private judgment. He not only preached against it, but also provided an exemplary model of seeking the truth regardless of the costs.\u201d\n\nIn Newman\u2019s case, Marr says, once he embraced Catholicism, \u201che left behind a stable and respectable career and was willing to suffer great public derision in order to enter her fold. How many of us would be willing to sacrifice friendships, respectability and job prospects for what we believed to be true?\u201d\n\nFor Marr, Newman\u2019s intellectual studies and his spiritual quest all \u201cconfessed that he felt like he had no choice [but to be received into the Church], because he believed his eternal destiny was at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis sense of the priority of eternal concerns over any temporal goods seemed to pervade every facet of Newman\u2019s life,\u201d Marr reflected, before adding: \u201cNear the end of his Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, he presses his readers to take seriously the question of where the true Church is, reminding them, \u2018Time is short; eternity is long.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegister correspondent K.V.
