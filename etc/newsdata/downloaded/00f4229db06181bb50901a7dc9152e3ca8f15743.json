Iranian authorities put out a red notice about her to Interpol, resulting in her being held in Ninoy Aquino international airport in Manila when she tried to enter the country on 17 October.\n\nIranian students barred from US: lost money, broken dreams, no answers Read more\n\nShe now fears Iran may seek to extradite her to Tehran then have her killed or jailed. She has shown support for activists opposing Iran\u2019s government in the past, notably at last year\u2019s Miss Intercontinental beauty pageant in Manila, at which she competed. At the event she waved a poster of Reza Pahlavi, an Iranian former crown prince who has criticised the Iranian regime.\n\n\u201cI used his photo in a beauty pageant and they are angry with me,\u201d she told Arab News. \u201cIf they deport me, they will give me at least 25 years in jail, if they do not kill me.\u201d\n\nBahari said she had studied studied dentistry in the Philippines since 2014, and had travelled in and out of the country before being stopped at the airport last week. \u201cThe Iran regime tried its best to deport me nine months ago, but I was successful,\u201d she told the Philippine Star. \u201cNow, they make a fake case in Iran.\u201d\n\nPhil Robertson at Human Rights Watch said: \u201cWhile waiting for the details to become clear, there should be no action under Iran\u2019s Interpol red notice, especially since under Interpol rules a red notice is null and void if the person named in the notice is found to be a refugee fleeing from the state that issued it.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Philippines\u2019 justice department said Bahari\u2019s asylum application would be processed in \u201cdue time\u201d.", "description": "Bahareh Zare Bahari says she is being sought for praising critic of Tehran regime", "authors": ["Jamie Fullerton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f39bd218f73eafec53745651c4364e987c4149/0_5_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a011bcb48b97af1a3861d4c468904fed", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
