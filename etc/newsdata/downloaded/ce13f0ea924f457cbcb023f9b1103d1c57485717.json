The Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, have been a key U.S. ally in the war on the Islamic State group and currently control much of the area close to the border with Turkey.\n\nThe SDF, which are led by the Kurdish YPG militia, has long angered the Turkish government and Erdogan. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is considered a terrorist group by the U.S.\n\nAs Kurdish fighters braced themselves for a Turkish invasion, the SDF reported Wednesday that ISIS sleeper cells had launched three attacks on its security bases in the city of Raqqa. NBC News could not independently confirm the attacks.\n\nReports of the attacks came after fighters assigned to guard thousands of captured extremists rushed to the border ahead of the expected attack by Turkish forces,a top Kurdish general told NBC News on Monday.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the SDF called on the international community and all countries in the international coalition against ISIS to \"carry out their responsibilities and avoid a possible impending humanitarian disaster.\"\n\n\"This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded,\" it said.\n\nAccording to multiple current and former U.S. officials, the White House's announcement blindsided not just America's Kurdish partners but almost everyone \u2014 senior officials at the Pentagon, the State Department and the White House, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, and U.S. allies in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nOn Monday, Trump warned in a tweetthat if Turkey \u2014 a longtime American ally with NATO's second-largest standing army \u2014 did anything that he considered to be \"off limits,\" he would \"totally destroy and obliterate\" its economy.\n\nThe White House said in a statement on Sunday that Turkey would now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.", "description": "The U.S. military began pulling back its forces from the Turkish border after the White House said it would not stand in the way of Ankara's operation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4219982/1000x563_nbc-191008-turkey-syria-mc-751_cce94691ab049e7dda830eee858ff76f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
