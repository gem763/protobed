(Photo: Yuri Gripas/Reuters) More\n\n\u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan,\u201d read a White House statement attributed to Trump. \u201cTurkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\u201d\n\nThe humanitarian crisis, involving atrocities by militias allied with Turkey and the displacement of tens or hundreds of thousands of Kurds who had been living in the region under U.S. protection, was predicted by many as soon as Trump announced a week ago that he would pull out a token force of American troops that had been stationed near the border, serving as a tripwire against an assault by Turkey.\n\nErdogan, whose government regards some Kurdish militias as terrorists intent on seizing part of Turkey for an independent Kurdish state, had been threatening to attack the Kurds for years. Trump\u2019s decision to redeploy the American forces away from the area came after a phone call between the two leaders.\n\nTurkish soldiers in the town of Tukhar, Syria, on Monday.

The White House statement seemed to indicate most would be withdrawn from Syria to other bases in the region to \u201cmonitor the situation\u201d with ISIS. A \u201csmall footprint\u201d would remain in southern Syria.\n\nIn a series of five tweets, Trump explained his rationale for abandoning Kurdish troops who had fought alongside the United States against ISIS.\n\nThe tweets came after Trump ordered all remaining U.S. troops out of northern Syria. Defense Secretary Mark Esper admitted Sunday that the situation on the ground is deteriorating rapidly and \u201cgets worse by the hour.\u201d\n\nThey also came after Syrian President Bashar Assad struck a deal with the abandoned Kurdish fighters in the conflict, with Syrian troops moving into the region for the first time in years.\n\nIn one, the president even cited the French statesman and military leader Napoleon Bonaparte, who has been dead for nearly 200 years.\n\nAfter defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\n....and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away! \u2014 Donald J.
