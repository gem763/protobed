While his companies were removed from sanctions, he personally remains listed. He has a long history of confrontation with American authorities. In the past decade, he was denied a business visa to the United States and was named a person of interest in the federal investigation into Russian meddling in U.S. elections.\n\nDespite all that, in January, the Office of Foreign Assets Control decided to lift sanctions on two of his companies, aluminum giant Rusal and its parent company, En+ Group.\n\nThere was bipartisan shock within the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Several Republican senators, including Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Susan Collins of Maine expressed their displeasure with the decision.\n\nSince the sanctions were lifted, Deripaska\u2019s lackeys have wasted no time in seeking to expand business into the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s been reported that Rusal will invest in a $1.7 billion aluminum mill in Kentucky. It would have been unthinkable that during the Cold War a Soviet aluminum company would have been allowed to invest in the U.S. So how has that been able to happen today?\n\nThere are two main reasons.\n\nFirst, it was a team of lawyers and lobbyists employed by Rusal and En+ Group that successfully persuaded the Office of Foreign Assets Control that Deripaska had relinquished control over those companies so they could be delisted.\n\nHeather Conley, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration dealing with European issues, perhaps described the situation the best.\n\n\u201cThey use our laws, our rules, our banks, our lawyers, our lobbyists\u2014it\u2019s a strategy from within,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd it was successful. At the time the sanctions were lifted, Cottonremarked: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Deripaska will be denied operational control of these companies, and I therefore believe they should remain subject to sanctions.\u201d\n\nSecond, Deripaska has been able to create an image of his Russian companies actually being respectable British entities. He hired former British minister and ex-Tory parliamentarian Greg Barker to serve as the chairman of En+ Group.\n\nBefore entering politics, Barker had a questionable history going back to the 1990s, working for Russian oligarchs, including Roman Abramovich.\n\nWhen En+ Group was listed, amid controversy, on the London Stock Exchange in November 2017, Barker\u2019s name gave a patina of respectability to investors.\n\nLast April, Barker sent letters to eight state governors making the case as to how their states could benefit from Rusal\u2019s investment. But nowhere does the letter even say that Rusal is Russian.\n\nRussia continues to prop up Syrian strongman Bashar Assad and occupy huge chunks of Ukraine and Georgia. It has meddled in U.S. elections and surely plans to do so again in the future.\n\nThe idea that a major Russian aluminum company should be allowed to invest in America\u2019s heartland is very concerning.\n\nLast year, London\u2019s Daily Telegraph reported that at least three suspected former Russian spies occupy key positions in Deripaska\u2019s businesses, including En+ Group. Barker\u2019s letters to state governors and Deripaska\u2019s legal gymnastics that resulted in his companies getting delisted from U.S. sanctions should be major eye-openers for U.S. policymakers.\n\nAt the end of the day, as massive Russian companies with global interests, Rusal\u2019s and En+ Group\u2019s investments in the United States should come under intense scrutiny. After all, in the case of Rusal, the aluminum it produces has helped build the Russian war machine we are seeing in action in places like Ukraine and Syria.\n\nU.S. governors need to enter into any deal with companies like Rusal with their eyes wide open, knowing who they are really dealing with\u2014not some British lord, but a Russian oligarch intimately linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.", "description": "Under the misleading guise of being a British company, a firm connected to a Russian oligarch is seeking to expand its investments and business dealings across the United States.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOnly a few months after Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska\u2019s companies were scandalously removed from U.S. sanctions, they have wasted no time trying to enter the U.S. market.\u00a0\n\nNo matter how enticing the foreign investment might be for some states, they should be extremely cautious when dealing with Russian companies\u2014especially those connected to the Kremlin.", "authors": ["Luke Coffey", "Director", "Douglas", "Sarah Allison Center For Foreign Policy", "Luke Coffey Oversees Research On Nations Stretching South America To The Middle East."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-172750694.jpg?itok=VkJ-IoPv"}
