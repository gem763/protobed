REUTERS/Lucas Landau/File Photo\n\nThe Brazilian Amazon is facing its worst spate of forest fires since 2010, with news of the destruction of the world\u2019s largest rainforest last month prompting global outcry and worries that it could hurt demand for the country\u2019s exports.\n\nBrazil\u2019s leading meat export industry group and other agribusiness associations on Friday joined with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to call for an end to deforestation on public lands, demanding government action amid the fires.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any contracts being canceled in any sectors. Exports continue, but the red light is flashing,\u201d Marcello Brito, president of the Brazilian Agribusiness Association, told reporters at a briefing.\n\n\u201cIf action isn\u2019t taken, if the discourse doesn\u2019t change, if the rhetoric doesn\u2019t change, then things can get worse.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists blame the strong rhetoric of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro in favor of developing the Amazon for emboldening deforesters and those setting fires.\n\nBolsonaro has complained that the country does not have the resources to police an area as large as the Amazon. The country is facing a steep budget shortfall as its economy recovers slower than expected from a deep recession.\n\nBrazil\u2019s Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the government did not have enough funds to hire more permanent environmental enforcement agents, who are used to combat deforestation and fires.\n\nInstead, the federal government plans to hire state environmental police on their days off to assist in enforcement, he said.\n\n\u201cYou have to be creative,\u201d Salles said.\n\nThe Group of Seven wealthy nations offered $20 million in aid last week to help fight the fires, but Bolsonaro said he would only accept it if French President Emmanuel Macron withdrew \u201cinsults\u201d against him.\n\nBolsonaro and Macron have been embroiled in a deeply personal and public war of words, with Bolsonaro mocking Macron\u2019s wife and accusing the French leader of disrespecting Brazil\u2019s sovereignty. Macron has called Bolsonaro a liar and said Brazilian women are \u201cprobably ashamed\u201d of him.\n\nIt remains unclear if Brazil will accept the offer, although the country will take 10 million pounds in aid from the United Kingdom, according to the British embassy in Brasilia.\n\nDEFORESTATION RISING\n\nIn the eight months through August, Amazon deforestation rose 92% to 6,404.8 square kilometers (2,472.91 square miles), an area larger than the U.S. state of Delaware, according to preliminary data from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE).\n\nIn August alone, deforestation more than tripled to 1,700.8 square kilometers (657 square miles).\n\nDeforestation is often followed by burning to clear land for ranching or farming, so the destruction in August could signal more fires to come in the Amazon, according Ana Paula Aguiar, an INPE land use researcher now on leave at Stockholm University.\n\n\u201cThey cut trees and then later they start fires, so possibly (the spike in fires) will continue,\u201d Aguiar said. \u201cIf they have already deforested in the previous month, we\u2019ll see fire this month.\u201d\n\nIn the first five days of September, INPE registered 2,799 fires in the Amazon, a decrease of 60% compared to the same period of 2018.\n\nIf the hotspots continue to be registered at the same rate, September could be a better month for fires, falling below the same month a year ago and the average for the last 20 years, Aguiar said. But with only a few days of data, it is too soon to tell, she said.\n\nEnvironment Minister Salles attributed the fall in the number of fires to the government\u2019s measures to combat the fires, which included sending in the military.\n\nRain could bring relief to the western part of the Brazilian Amazon, although to the east broad swathes of the rainforest will remain extremely dry, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nCALL TO ACTION\n\nMeat group Abiec and NGOs Imazon and IPAM are among the 11 Brazilian groups that signed on to a campaign on Friday calling for a Justice Ministry task force to resolve conflicts over public land, representatives of the groups told reporters.\n\nThe protection of the Amazon, which absorbs vast amounts of greenhouse gas that causes global warming, is seen as vital to the fight against climate change. Roughly 60% of the Amazon lies in Brazil.\n\nThe campaign also calls for another task force to examine forests on public land that have not been assigned any reserve or other status.\n\nAbout 40% of deforestation in 2018 occurred on public lands, according to IPAM.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nAll forests should receive designations based on what they are best suited for, IPAM Executive Director Andre Guimaraes said. For example, if it contains sensitive species, a forest could be protected as a reserve or national park, he said.\n\nOthers could be designated as national forests or as concession areas for sustainable logging, Guimaraes said.\n\nRoughly 650,000 square km (250,966 square miles) of forest in Brazil - an area nearly twice the size of Germany - have no designation, according to IPAM.", "description": "Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest rose for the fourth straight month in August from a year earlier, according to preliminary government data released on Friday, adding to concerns over fires already ravaging the region.", "authors": ["Jake Spring", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427107562&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8601V", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
