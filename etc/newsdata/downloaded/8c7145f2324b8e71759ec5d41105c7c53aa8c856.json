In mid-August, InvestorPlace\u2019s Luke Lango suggested three catalysts existed that would move Intel stock to $60 within a few quarters. Since Luke made this call, INTC is up 12% and definitely on the move.\n\nA few days before Lango\u2019s Intel buy recommendation, IP\u2019s James Brumley was positive about the company despite the fact it was well behind Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) when it comes to launching a 7-nanometer processor.\n\nIn early June, I argued that Intel\u2019s free cash flow yield of 6.7% suggested that it was getting closer to value territory. Up almost 20% in the three-and-a-half months since, its free cash flow yield has dropped to 5.4%, a good, if not great FCF yield.\n\nAll things considered, Intel stock remains a safer play than some of its more volatile competitors.\n\nA Hidden Reason to Buy INTC Stock\n\nFree cash flow and a sound balance sheet are smart reasons to own Intel. However, there\u2019s another reason why some investors might consider buying its stock: Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR), the leading enterprise data cloud provider.\n\nThe California-based company has had a crazy year on the markets. Down 17% year to date through Sept. 12, it has gained back 82% of those losses in the past 90 days, a chunk of it coming in the past week as a result of better-than-expected Q2 earnings.\n\nIn June, after reporting disappointing Q1 2019 results, CEO Tom Reilly announced his resignation effective July 31. The company has struggled with its $5.2 billion merger with HortonWorks, a combination that gives it more than $700 million in sales and 2,500 customers.\n\nWhat\u2019s this got to do with Intel?\n\nIntel owns 26.1 million shares of Cloudera, making it one of the company\u2019s largest shareholders with 9.3% of its stock. Intel originally invested $742 million in Cloudera in May 2014. With the HortonWorks merger, Intel\u2019s ownership stake was diluted down to less than 10%.\n\nIn the three months ended July 31, Cloudera lost $87 million on $196.7 million in revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, it lost $7.4 million from operations in the quarter, $90 million less than a year earlier on a 16% increase in annualized recurring revenue.\n\nIn 2020, it expects to lose between 24 cents and 28 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis with as much as $775 million in revenue.\n\nWhile Cloudera has great potential, the fact that it\u2019s struggling to make money has made it a difficult stock for analysts to get behind, with just six making it a buy out of 20 covering it.\n\nCarl Icahn Likes Intel Stock and Cloudera\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s troubles have caught the attention of Carl Icahn, who owns more than 18% of its stock. Although Cloudera is losing business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Icahn believes that Cloudera stock is undervalued.\n\nCurrently, Intel\u2019s ownership stake is worth much less than Cloudera\u2019s $15 IPO price.\n\nIf you like Cloudera but are nervous about making a bet on it while it\u2019s still searching for a permanent CEO, buying Intel stock is a smart way to protect your potential downside.\n\nAt the time of this writing Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe post The Hidden Reason to Buy Intel Stock appeared first on InvestorPlace.", "description": "As tech stocks go, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) provides investors with potential upside while also providing a reasonable amount of downside protection should the global economy slow.
