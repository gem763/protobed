Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said in a statement. \"President Trump should rethink this decision immediately.\"\n\nWhile Democrats also roundly criticized Trump\u2019s decision, the outpouring of opposition from the president\u2019s party stood out.\n\nTrump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry, is relying on support from Republican senators to remain in office. Trump has publicly lamented the lack of unity among Republicans during the impeachment process.\n\nMost Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump\u2019s calls for Ukraine and China to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a political opponent \u2014 acts that Democrats have seized on in their impeachment investigation.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s move to draw down troops in Syria, announced Sunday night in a White House statement, opened him up to direct criticism from some of the lawmakers who have tried to defend him in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has called impeachment attempts \u201cridiculous,\u201d blasted Trump\u2019s Syria decision Monday.\n\n\u201cSo sad. So dangerous,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cPresident Trump may be tired of fighting radical Islam. They are NOT tired of fighting us.\u201d\n\nIn tweets Monday morning, Trump defended his decision and said that the United States was being played for a \u201csucker\u201d by continuing to serve as \u201ca policing operation\u201d for people in Middle East countries \u201cwho don\u2019t even like the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u201d\n\nHe also appeared to warn the Turkish government ahead of its offensive.\n\n\u201cIf Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nRepublicans quickly began looking at options to counter Trump, including teaming with Democrats in a rare bipartisan rebuke of the president.\n\nGraham said he spoke with Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and would introduce new sanctions targeting Turkey if Turkish forces invaded Syria.\n\n\u201cHope and expect sanctions against Turkey \u2014 if necessary \u2014 would be veto-proof,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nIn a joint statement with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Monday that he would seek to hold congressional hearings \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on Trump\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cBarring a reversal of this decision, the Administration must come before Congress and explain how betraying an ally and ceding influence to terrorists and adversaries is not disastrous for our national security interests,\u201d the two senators said.", "description": "Several senators said that the president\u2019s move in northern Syria would abandon U.S.-allied Kurdish fighters ahead of a long-threatened Turkish offensive.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Nuvehio6g00m0DjofN77Dsy_I2w=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TU5UDCWJX4I6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
