He ran out of the press conference in Moscow last week. It is in his nature. Trust me I am coming for him.\n\n\"Where is he now in this country? I fly in, he flies out. Typical.\n\n\"I am going to go through the entire roster like a chainsaw through butter.\"", "description": "The pair met at last year's World Cup staged in Russia but did not get to share a drink together for security reasons", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Stanislav Krasilnikov Tass", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743471.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FBL-WC-2018-MATCH64-FRA-CRO.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
