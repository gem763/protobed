HOW TO MAKE LONG SPRINKLES\n\nTo make your own long sprinkles, fill a piping bag fitted with small plain nozzle with coloured royal icing and pipe long strips of royal icing onto a piece of baking paper and allow to dry overnight or in a low oven (60 degrees). Once dry, cut the long strips into short pieces and mix the colours together. Store in an airtight jar.\n\n2.
