The connection is part of efforts to bolster physical and digital connections between the two cities and support businesses looking to expand into Western China.\n\nCurrently available to organisations across all seven industrial parks in Chongqing, the internet data channel (IDC) aimed to improve digital connections between Southeast Asia -- via Singapore -- and Western China, through Chongqing. The industrial parks included Liangjiang Digital Economy Industrial Park, China Zhigu (CQ) Science Park, and Blockchain Innovation Industrial Base.\n\nSingapore to feel impact of China-US trade dispute if prolonged Tensions between the two economic powerhouses will lead to fragmented technology markets and, if prolonged, drag down Singapore's economy, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who urges both countries to find ways to establish mutual trust.

In addition, it would provide opportunities for Singapore telcos to carry data traffic between Southeast Asia and Western China, and support Singapore businesses looking to expand into Chongqing or Western China.\n\nIMDA also pointed to long-term plans to attract organisations from that part of China to reach Singapore via the IDC, tapping Chongqing as a hub. It pitched the data link service to sectors that required quality bandwidth and connectivity, such as content streaming and online learning, and companies involved in joint development projects.\n\nThe Singapore industry regulator said 12 partnership agreements were inked at the launch, bringing together telcos and IDC users that included China's three largest telcos -- China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile -- and Singapore's Singtel and StarHub, as well as local organisations such as Tencent Technology, Chongqing Haifu Medical Technology, Yidu Cloud Technology, and National Cancer Centre Singapore.\n\nIn its statement on the launch, Singtel said it would work with the three Chinese telcos to provide \"secure, high-speed connectivity\" across the seven industrial parks and signed an agreement that would see seven Chongqing-based businesses from the manufacturing, research, data-hosting, and blockchain sectors tapping Singtel's network for their connectivity needs when they entered or expanded into the Singapore market.\n\nSingtel's managing director of global enterprise business Lim Seng Kong said: \"With enhanced data connectivity, businesses are better-placed to deploy artificial intelligence, IoT (Internet of Things), data analytics, and other emerging technologies to power growth and drive their transformation.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nSingapore to feel impact of China-US trade dispute if prolonged\n\nTensions between the two economic powerhouses will lead to fragmented technology markets and, if prolonged, drag down Singapore's economy, says Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who urges both countries to find ways to establish mutual trust.\n\nSingapore, China to collaborate on fintech initiatives\n\nCentral banks from both countries have inked an agreement to jointly work on fintech innovation projects, research, and regulations, whilst two companies from both countries will collaborate on cross-border services.\n\nSingaporean and Sichuan firms ink partnerships in medtech and logistics\n\nSingaporean medtech businesses are linking up with industry peers in Sichuan to enhance diagnostics and patient care, while local companies from other sectors look for opportunities in the Chinese province's transport and logistics sectors.\n\nSingapore inks Asean partnerships to drive technology patents\n\nA two-year agreement has been signed to prioritise patent applications in emerging technologies such as fintech, cybersecurity, and robotics, which aims to fast-track the turnaround time for initial action to six months.\n\nSingtel inks IoT partnership deals with China Mobile, Microsoft\n\nSingapore telco teams up with China Mobile Internet to drive the adoption of both carriers' IoT services and launches an \"artificial intelligence-powered\" IoT network on Microsoft Azure.", "description": "Available to companies across seven industrial parks in the southwestern city of China, the dedicated data link has a total capacity of 260Gbps and is part of efforts to support connectivity between businesses in the region.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/08/18/0dadb5fa-26c0-11e4-8c7f-00505685119a/thumbnail/770x578/afc7eb287a348ae87d6605b48bdebe9e/vocus-sets-sights-on-top-three-fibre-ranking-in-australia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
