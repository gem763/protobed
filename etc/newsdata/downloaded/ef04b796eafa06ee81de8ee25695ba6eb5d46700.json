I hope you can see me like I see myself now. Thank you.\"\n\nThe singer went on to say: \"I am at no stage just yet to eloquently speak at length about what it means to be non binary but I can't wait for the day that I am. So for now I just want to be VISIBLE and open.\"\n\nAt last week's GQ Men of the Year Awards, Smith walked the red carpet wearing high heels, posting: \"I'd never ever ever be able to be myself like this in front of the industry or anyone.\"\n\nToryn Glavin, trans engagement manager at LGBT charity Stonewall, said: \"We're delighted that Sam Smith feels able to speak openly about their gender identity, and their visibility will have a huge impact on many non-binary people.\n\n\"Sadly we know that it is still far too hard for people to be open and accepted for who they are, and we will keep campaigning until every LGBT person is accepted without exception.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
