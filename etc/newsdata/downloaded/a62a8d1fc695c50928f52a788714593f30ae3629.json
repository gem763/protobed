Swimming is an activity that nearly every kid enjoys in summer, but you need to know how to keep them safe before they even consider entering the water. Here's how you can start.\n\nTeaching them to swim\n\nLet\u2019s start off with the basics \u2014 actually teaching them to swim, which hopefully, eventually is the ultimate swimming safety hack. With a baby, you can start by simply getting them comfortable in the water and even going under the surface. To do that, use the old blow-in-their-face trick:\n\nThat\u2019s obviously just a start and is not actual swimming but it does help them get used to being in a pool.\n\nSo when should you start actual swim lessons? Well, earlier than we used to think. Swimming lessons can start to become beneficial around the child\u2019s first birthday.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a low-cost swim lesson option, research your local council pool, or smaller swim schools in your local area.\n\nDrowning prevention\n\nHowever, however, do not let these lessons lull you into a false sense of security. Learning to swim will help young kids begin to learn the basics of going underwater, floating and just generally moving around in the water. That doesn\u2019t mean you can now take your eyes off them.\n\nAnd oddly enough, spotting someone who is drowning is harder than you might think. There\u2019s not all that thrashing and gasping and yelling depicted in TV and movies. No, in real life, it\u2019s much quieter and harder to spot.\n\nIn case regular drowning isn\u2019t awful or scary enough, you\u2019ve probably also heard about \u201cdry drowning\u201d or \u201csecondary drowning.\u201d Dry drowning is when a person has aspirated water into the trachea and down into the lungs and dies hours or days later. While it\u2019s important to understand the signs and symptoms of dry drowning, it doesn\u2019t mean your child is in danger every time they swallow a little pool water.\n\nOut on the open water\n\nGreat, so they\u2019ve had their lessons, you know how to watch for signs of drowning, and your kids are like fish in the pool. Maybe now they\u2019re 9 or 10 years old and have been swimming with proficiency for years. You can finally relax on that holiday trip to the beach, right?\n\nNope, nope, nope. Swimming in open water is a totally different beast with drop-offs, strong currents and limited visibility.\n\nBe extra vigilant around open water and teach your kids that it\u2019s different than swimming in a pool.\n\nYou can relax on this rule, though\n\nThere is one thing we give you permission to be less vigilant about: Eating and swimming. There is no actual health reason to make kids wait 10 minutes, 30 minutes or a whole freaking hour after eating before they can go back in the pool.\n\nPull \u2018em out, feed \u2018em a sandwich, and send \u2018em right back in.", "description": "Summer is just around the corner, and it's important to prepare in more ways than one.
