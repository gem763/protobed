Japan is highest at 84.2 years.\n\nApart from overdoses, suicides and the rising death toll caused by Alzheimer\u2019s disease were also responsible for the erosion of life expectancy, which was much more marked in men than in women.\n\nGindi compared the period to 1992-93, the height of the HIV epidemic.\n\n\u201cThat drop in life expectancy that we started to see was a real clarion call to say that this was an issue that needed attention and that was, in a very similar way, killing people who are in these younger age groups,\u201d she said.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Drug overdoses have driven the first significant reduction in US life expectancy since the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/93be63_heroin-addict-in-philadelphia-in-2017-drug-overdoses-driving-us-life-expectancy-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
