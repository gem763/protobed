(Image: HBO)\n\nThe story taking place in Watchmen\u2019s present is informed by that world\u2019s past\u2014one similar to ours where groups of white supremacists have terrorised black people across the world for centuries. At times, the show assumes you know this fact to be true but in others, like the opening moments of this week\u2019s episode, Watchmen slows down to provide everyone with an important history lesson to refresh our memories.\n\nThough the German Nazi Party had no qualms about discriminating against and forcibly sterilizing black people living in Germany, the Nazi were also known to occasionally attempt to convince black American soldiers to surrender during World War II by dropping leaflets into their laps from aeroplanes which pointed out America\u2019s own legacy of anti-black racism. The appeals were often filled with blatant lies about German racism and sharply contrasted with the way the Nazi regime vilified black people in its media aimed at white Germans.\n\nThe leaflets\u2019 promises of happy lives in Germany for black soldiers who surrendered were calculated, obvious attempts at sowing discord and mistrust within the Americans\u2019 ranks. But there were aspects of the propaganda that touched on the truth about how black soldiers were fighting for a country that did not truly love them or believe in their right to exist as equal citizens. The man we first met while he was trying to save his family during the Tulsa Riots in Watchmen\u2019s premiere episode might not have joined the losing team during the war, but he brought the message carried in one of those pamphlets back home with him to Oklahoma where his young son would eventually discover them.\n\n\u201cMartial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship\u201d uses all of that as the pretext for Watchmen\u2019s next chapter, which has quickly become a murder mystery as the Tulsa PD attempt to learn who discovered its beloved police chief Judd Crawford. The episode also establishes how each instalment of the series will blend together seamlessly and the show picks right up from the premiere\u2019s final moments when Sister Knight pulls up to discover Judd\u2019s body hanging from a tree above Will, a mysterious man in a wheelchair.\n\nHorrific as the murder scene is, Sister Knight is still able to think clearly enough about what she\u2019s seeing to know that the old man\u2019s story about killing Judd himself has to be a lie because, as the man explains, he\u2019s over 100 years old. Angela\u2019s none too amused by the man\u2019s cryptic suggestions that he might have psychic powers or be Doctor Manhattan in disguise, but she also doesn\u2019t really know what to do in the situation because of how strange it is. Between her immediate grief, rage, and confusion, Angela\u2019s barely present to appreciate what Will\u2019s trying to tell her after she makes the snap decision to pile him into her car and take him back to her secret base of operations. But when Will plainly states that Judd kept dangerous secrets from the people who trusted him that needed to be exposed, Angela can\u2019t help but suit up and get ready to begin looking into things more deeply for herself.\n\nWill telling Angela that she curses too much. (Image: HBO)\n\nScenes like the Tulsa PD coming together at the site of Judd\u2019s murder showcase Watchmen\u2019s ability to gently nod to the source material in small, clever ways that work surprisingly well despite how campy they sound on paper. Looking Glass pushing up his reflective mask to munch on fistfuls of nuts echoes panels of Rorschach loudly slurping up beans while waiting in Nite Owl\u2019s apartment. Looking Glass is similarly aloof in the way that he interacts with his colleagues, but the dynamic between this Watchmen\u2019s masked cops is distinct, if only because the police all seem to be working with the same idea about who their collective foe is. But at the same time, all of the surviving cops are still somewhat suspicious about what\u2019s happened to Judd because the crime scene\u2019s details don\u2019t exactly add up.\n\n\u201cMartial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship\u201d makes a hard left back into dark territory with yet another flashback, but this time to Angela\u2019s past on the evening of the White Night\u2014the night the Seventh Kavalry launched a coordinated attack on Tulsa that left multiple cops brutally murdered. After nearly dying, Angela awakes in a hospital room to find Judd, who explains that they are two of the only officers to survive the White Night.\n\nThe scene\u2019s meant to make us understand the love and affection Angela and Judd felt for one another that was borne out of their shared trauma and their commitment to justice. And in the present, the cops mobilize in a way that speaks to how Judd\u2019s death has devastated them, but Sister Night\u2019s heart isn\u2019t fully in it as the police descend on a white shantytown\u2014\u201cNixonville\u201d\u2014in an attempt to flush out the 7K members they think might have killed their colleague.\n\nThe way this episode repeatedly pivots back and forth between grim darkness and moments of occasional levity mirrors the conflicting emotions Angela\u2019s grappling with as she keeps up appearances in her civilian life and continues to do her police work in disguise. In one moment, Angela\u2019s wailing on a suspected-racist with terrifying fury, and the next she\u2019s in her police car sobbing because she knows how out of control she\u2019s becoming. But because so much of Angela\u2019s life is built around hiding herself from the outside world, she\u2019s only but so able to express all of these emotions openly.\n\nPersonal truths aren\u2019t something that Angela can safely afford to trade in with most other people, but she is about to make a kind of cathartic trip to Tulsa\u2019s Greenwood Centre for Cultural Heritage, a technologically-advanced museum celebrating the legacy of Tulsa\u2019s historic black population that was devastated by bombings. She\u2019s there to test a surreptitiously secured sample from Will that can be processed free of charge at the Greenwood Centre, and if he\u2019s got any roots in Tulsa, the system will tell her. But you can also see that Angela\u2019s there, partially, because she\u2019s unsure of her own identity in an existential sense, and the Centre\u2019s system (portrayed by Henry Louis Gates) tells her that it can\u2019t explain those kinds of truths to her.\n\nLooking Glass watching American Hero Story. (Image: HBO)\n\nThe episode makes yet another of its hard left turns into the surreal with a curious detour into American Hero Story, an in-universe show chronicling Watchmen\u2019s early 20th-century history. It\u2019s not clear if American Hero Story is purposefully aping, but it definitely seems like it is given the way the show\u2019s hyper-violent, sexually explicit, and controversial subject matter is so extreme that the FCC considers the show \u201cemotionally harmful\u201d for young viewers to watch.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just young people that are watching the show, we see that nearly everyone in Tulsa, from Angela\u2019s son to a group of Seventh Kavalry racists tune in regularly as if it\u2019s must-see TV, which is an interesting way of commenting on what pop culture is like in this reality. While most everyone else is raptly watching Hooded Justice\u2019s American Hero Story origins, Angela busies herself by paying respects at Judd\u2019s wake where his wife Jane introduces her to Senator Joe Keene, a rising political star. Within moments of arriving, Angela full-on faints, seemingly out of distress, but after Jane leaves her to rest, Angela whips out a pair of future-tech goggles that allow her to see things hidden behind walls in Judd\u2019s bedroom, and it isn\u2019t long before she sees something dreadful.\n\n\u201cMartial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship\u201d treats the idea of police offers being active within white supremacist organisations as some sort of wild twist that\u2019s supposed to shock audiences, when the reality is that there are reports of just that happening all over the country in 2019. Angela\u2019s dismayed to find a mannequin bust cloaked in a Klan hood tucked away within Judd\u2019s closet, but the moment lacks the emotional oomph the show seems to be going for because, again, this is all firmly grounded in reality. Thankfully, the episode seems to understand that lingering on the hood reveal would quickly grow a bit weary, and it\u2019s safe to assume that Angela will follow up on her discovery as the season progresses.\n\nWhat\u2019s rather astonishing about \u201cMartial Feats of Comanche Horsemanship\u201d is how much you realise is packed into the episode and how much development it provides almost all of its characters with\u2014even the weird, cryptic ones like Jeremy Irons\u2019 Ozymandias, whose madness we see in a completely new light as the episode comes to a close. It was always clear that something was amiss on the palatial estate where Adrian\u2019s being kept and tended to by his two slightly-off servants. But we\u2019re clued in on just how messed up the man is in the form of a twisted one-act stage play Ozymandias forces his servants to perform.\n\nIn his exile, Ozymandias has taken to periodically making his servants basically act out Doctor Manhattan\u2019s creation by way of a freak accident. Every time, Ozymandias forces Mr. Phillips (Tom Milson) to step into what appears to be an incinerator, which Ms. Crookshanks (Sara Vickers) then locks as she explains that the machine\u2019s safety mechanism makes it impossible for her to open it. Of course, this is all a farce for Ozymandias\u2019 enjoyment, and after Mr. Phillips is burned alive, a nude man painted in blue descends from the rafters wearing a fencing mask made to look like Doctor Manhattan\u2019s face.\n\nThe entire performance is made that much more difficult to watch because you can see how much Ozymandias enjoys every detail of it and how he\u2019s still clearly obsessed with Manhattan, who probably knows exactly what his old foe does in his spare time, and thinks it\u2019s fucking weird. It\u2019s not until the ersatz Manhattan pulls off his mask to reveal he\u2019s identical to the now-deceased Mr. Phillips that you realise all of Ozymandias\u2019 servants are apparently clones of one another destined to meet terrible fates for their master\u2019s entertainment.\n\nThe second episode of Watchmen closes out with a flurry of not-entirely-unexpected, but nonetheless gripping, revelations as Angela returns to her hideout to confront Will about what she found in Judd\u2019s closet. The man refuses to answer her questions directly, but he lets her know that he\u2019s come into her life because he has plans for her. Before she can interrogate him further though, an automated call from the Greenwood Centre informing Angela that Will\u2019s her biological grandfather almost completely knocks the cop off balance.\n\nEvery time it seems as if Angela\u2019s getting closer to the truths we all need to know, Watchmen pulls the rug out from under her or, in this episode\u2019s case, snatches her car\u2014with Will inside it\u2014right up into the sky before she can even think of how to react.", "description": "The story taking place in Watchmen\u2019s present is informed by that world\u2019s past\u2014one similar to ours where groups of white supremacists have terrorised black people across the world for centuries.
