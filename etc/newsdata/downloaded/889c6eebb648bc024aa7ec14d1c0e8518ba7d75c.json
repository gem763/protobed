She also needs counseling now, the suit claims.\n\nPerrini contends that gravediggers who backfilled a grave adjacent to Cullen\u2019s parents\u2019 left an underground void that caused Cullen to sink into the netherworld.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that this should happen to anybody,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cWe want to make sure the cemetery and employees learn from this. We want to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else.\u201d\n\nCullen is suing St. John\u2019s Cemetery Corp. \u2014 an arm of the Catholic Church\u2019s Brooklyn Diocese \u2014 which manages St. Charles Resurrection.
