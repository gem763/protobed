At the time, the country was just emerging from a recession and many young people cited their family\u2019s inability to afford the high cost of driving as a reason why they did not obtain their license sooner.\n\nThe new AAA (auto club) Foundation study surveyed young adults ages 18-24 to determine when they obtained their license and found that nationally, 40.8% got their license at or before age 16 and 60.3% got their license before the age of 18.\n\n\u201cThe trend for teens to acquire their driver\u2019s license has changed over the past 10 years,\u201d Dr. David Yang, executive director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, said in a prepared statement. \u201cMany are getting licensed before the age of 18, which means more of Generation Z is learning to drive under the protection of state graduated driver licensing programs and parental supervision.\u201d\n\nWe urge young drivers to put the phone down.\n\nTexting and driving kills.\n\nDrivers have been warned about it. Laws have been passed to prevent it.\n\nEveryone has heard about all the serious injuries and deaths caused by distracted driving but our roadways are still full of people texting and driving.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s \u201chands-free\u201d law took effect July 1 last year.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear to have even made a dent in the number of people texting and driving.\n\nAnd people are dying on our roadways at an alarming rate.\n\nThe law prohibits drivers from having a phone or stand-alone electronic device in their hands or touching any part of their body while operating a motor vehicle on Georgia roadways.\n\nA Bluetooth speakerphone, earpiece, electronic watch or wireless headset is allowed so long as it is not being operated by the driver\u2019s hand. The use of GPS and navigational devices are allowed but drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or supported by any part of their body.\n\nThe law is designed to prevent cellphones from interfering with a driver\u2019s ability to operate a vehicle and keep attention on the road.\n\nDistracted driving is a danger to everyone on the roadways.\n\nThe law allows drivers to use \u201chands-free\u201d technology to make or receive phone calls and use GPS devices, but drivers cannot at any time use their phones to write, read or send text messages, e-mails, social media and internet data. The use of voice-to-text technology is allowed, officials explained.\n\nThe hands-free law also prohibits drivers from watching videos as well as recording videos, though GPS navigational videos and continuously running dash cams are permitted.\n\nDrivers can listen to music through streaming apps on their phone, but they cannot activate their apps or change music through their phone while driving. Music streaming apps programmed and controlled through the vehicle\u2019s radio system are allowed.\n\nMusic streaming apps that also have video are not allowed since the law specifically prohibits drivers from watching videos.\n\nFor anyone still confused about what they are allowed to do when driving, you cannot have a phone in your hands or on any part of your body if you want to make or receive a phone call or use GPS.\n\nYou cannot legally text, e-mail or surf the internet on your phone at all when you are driving.\n\nDistracted driving is illegal and deadly.\n\nOnline: https://www.valdostadailytimes.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 19\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle on lack of supermarkets or healthy food options in parts of Georgia:\n\nYou might have lived here your entire lives without realizing Augusta\u2019s landscape includes dangerous deserts and swamps right in the middle of town.\n\nThe Augusta Commission might not have known, either, until resident Von Pouncey gave its members a geography lesson of sorts earlier this month.\n\nThe places Pouncey referred to are actually food deserts and food swamps. A food desert is a neighborhood with little access to affordable, healthy food. There aren\u2019t many - if any - grocery stores, farmers\u2019 markets or other stores where neighborhood residents can buy something nutritious to eat. You\u2019d have to have a reliable car or a desire to walk several miles.\n\nA food swamp, on the other hand, has food - but like a real swamp has water: It\u2019s there, but there are few benefits from consuming it. Food swamps are neighborhoods that have fast-food places, convenience stores and liquor stores, and abundant junk food outstrips healthy-food options.\n\nIn nature, a place that\u2019s a desert and a swamp at the same time would be a topographical oddity. In Augusta, it\u2019s the Laney-Walker neighborhood.\n\nTo get a feeling for what it\u2019s like to live in a neighborhood with such bad access to good food, Pouncey told commissioners she shopped for food only in the Laney-Walker area for three weeks. In that time she didn\u2019t visit a single supermarket because there aren\u2019t any supermarkets.\n\nShe had to visit dollar stores and convenience stores instead, where it\u2019s not unusual for food to be either expired or outrageously overpriced. For what you would pay for a gallon of milk, Pouncey paid for just a quart.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy to resist an urge to get in my car to go to another state or go to another district,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy for anybody.\n\nIf you want an exact number, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 23 million people live in food deserts that are at least one mile away from a supermarket. That 23 million includes about 6 million children.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to make you sick. We hope you didn\u2019t eat before reading this. But if you did, you probably didn\u2019t have a problem getting that food.\n\nIn Laney-Walker, you used to be able to walk a mile or two to the 15th Street Kroger supermarket - until it closed two years ago. Currently it\u2019s about a two- or three-mile walk to Paul\u2019s IGA on East Boundary Street. We wouldn\u2019t advise buying frozen food before hiking back in the Georgia heat.\n\nAnd the local problem isn\u2019t exclusive to Laney-Walker. In 2013, Augusta Chronicle staff writers Sandy Hodson and Tom Corwin performed a detailed analysis of Richmond County\u2019s healthy food options and found five areas that could be classified as food deserts\n\nThe five were the Turpin Hill and Bethlehem neighborhoods, bordering Laney-Walker; downtown Augusta; the lower east side of south Augusta; and an area east of Washington Road to the Savannah River bordered by Interstate 20 and the Columbia County line There were plenty of fast-food places. There were high percentages of people in poverty, except for that border area.\n\nYou could rattle off a lot of reasons for why Laney-Walker isn\u2019t vibrant and thriving. Poverty has taken root in places such as Laney-Walker because of the lack of jobs and stable two-parent households - factors that contribute to an area\u2019s food insecurity, because retailers don\u2019t want to build groceries in such neighborhoods.\n\nSo folks who have low incomes to begin with are forced to shop where food prices are too high. The food they get isn\u2019t the best to maintain good health.\n\nAnd - as we\u2019ve said before - how alert and focused will a student be in school if the child is not properly fed at home? Or what if the child is fed, but fed the wrong food - contributing to America\u2019s childhood obesity problem?\n\nEven Golden Harvest Food Bank\u2019s superb work in providing sustenance to the area\u2019s hungry isn\u2019t quite enough to feed the enormous need.\n\nYou can\u2019t develop a recipe for success with a shortage of ingredients.\n\nThere are, however, encouraging plans for Laney-Walker. Investors are exploring the potential of that long-struggling section of the city, and there are new residential and commercial projects on the drawing board and nearly ready to go.\n\nBut there still isn\u2019t a grocery store. And there were very few, if any, easy ways to get nutritious food.\n\nThankfully, that could change, and it\u2019s about time.\n\nTim McFalls, the Augusta Economic Development Authority\u2019s retail and commercial manager, is in lease negotiations with the Good Food Markets chain on possibly bringing one of its stores to Laney-Walker - not soon, but it\u2019s not years away, either.\n\nA Good Food Markets store is not like a typical supermarket. The space figure being discussed in local negotiations is about 1,000 square feet. It\u2019s more like how neighborhood markets were before supermarkets sprang up. The stores\u2019 goal is to give a supermarket\u2019s selection in a small space, and they rely on local food producers and distributors to accomplish that.\n\nMore importantly, the Good Food business model targets food deserts.\n\nGood Food has requirements it must meet before locating in a community, much like any supermarket chain. But while other groceries operate with a profit motive, Good Food is the flagship project of the nonprofit Oasis Community Partners. With support from both public and nonprofit partners, Good Food goes where retailers won\u2019t.\n\nThat partnership of stakeholders could start momentum toward true revitalization. With steady access to nutritious food, a neighborhood\u2019s health improves, which improves its morale and spirit, which could encourage a neighborhood to improve overall. Over time, that could even attract more retailers, which would continue the cycle of growth and prosperity.\n\nDeserts and swamps usually aren\u2019t ideal places to build. But laying down a strong enough foundation could help transform the landscape into something remarkable.\n\nOnline: https://www.augustachronicle.com\n\n___\n\nOct. 19\n\nThe Savannah Morning News on proposed Georgia Power rate hikes:\n\nThe line for those eager to pay more for electricity, or anything for that matter, is about as long as the one to swim with malnourished alligators.\n\nGeorgia Power\u2019s proposed rate hike has customers mimicking a swamp full of crabby reptiles. Approximately 75 local ratepayers joined two state regulators for a town hall on the subject last week at the Coastal Georgia Center.\n\nSeventeen Savannahians spoke at the event, and the majority weren\u2019t the environmental activists who frequently criticize the public utility. Most of the comments came from citizens concerned with what a bigger power bill will mean to their wallets.\n\nAttendees raised many salient points, particularly in terms of Georgia Power\u2019s proposed billing method. The utility plans a significant hike \u2014 79.5% \u2014 to the monthly base fee and a more nominal increase in the consumption rate.\n\nThis approach eases Georgia Power\u2019s ability to predict revenues, especially during extremely hot summers or exceptionally cold winters, but the attendees said it diminishes the economic incentive for ratepayers to conserve energy. Instead of a \u201cuse more, pay more\u201d model based on charging per kilowatt hour, the premium is on the service connection.\n\nMany of the customers who use the least amount of electricity are seniors and low-income families \u2014 those who can least absorb a major bill increase. Georgia Power has pledged breaks for those customers but has yet to unveil those plans.\n\nThis has created a PR dilemma for Georgia Power, one critics are seizing on. That the utility also cites coal ash cleanup among its justifications for the increase is another point of contention. Then there\u2019s the continued angst over the cost overruns at Plant Vogtle, though Vogtle is not a part of this rate plan.\n\nPublic outcry is understandable. But before you start picketing your neighborhood substation, it\u2019s important to consider the full context of Georgia Power\u2019s proposal.\n\n- Building a budget\n\nEvery three years, Georgia Power must present a rate plan to the Georgia Public Service Commission, the elected board that regulates the state\u2019s utilities.\n\nThe process forces Georgia Power to project its costs. A utility is a capital-intensive business \u2014 from building, operating and maintaining power generation facilities to investing in all the equipment, such as poles and power lines that keep the grid hot.\n\nGeorgia Power must also plan for the unexpected, specifically storm recovery expenses. The company has already depleted its storm recovery reserves and spent an additional $450 million to address the effects of extreme weather throughout the state.\n\nAll the while, Georgia Power is required, per agreement with the PSC, to provide a minimum shareholder return of 10%, which is factored into the plan as well.\n\nSome will argue Georgia Power\u2019s floor is too high, although it falls within the national range. PSC staff, in a recent filing, has suggested an adjustment to Georgia Power\u2019s profit margin band, which also includes a ceiling whereby excess profits must be returned to customers.\n\nThe margin will certainly be part of the PSC-Georgia Power discussion later this year.\n\nTherein lies another misnomer: that Georgia Power\u2019s rate proposal is an all-or-nothing prospect. The plan was filed in June for stakeholder and PSC scrutiny. The PSC has held one public hearing and will host two more in November.\n\nThe proposal will be finalized in December. If history is a guide, the actual rate increase will fall below the initially requested amount.\n\nThe last time Georgia Power requested a rate increase, 2013, the utility asked for $1.4 billion and received $870 million. Three years earlier, in 2010, Georgia Power requested $2.4 billion; the PSC approved a bump worth $1.55 billion.\n\nJust two days ago, the PSC staff recommended Georgia Power be granted a $1 billion rate increase as opposed to the $2.2 billion request.\n\nThe takeaway for ratepayers is this: Express concerns about the proposed rate hike, but dial back the outrage. That two PSC members traveled to Savannah last week to listen to citizen feedback is encouraging.\n\nLet\u2019s keep the conversation going.\n\nOnline: https://www.savannahnow.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Recent editorials from Georgia newspapers:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
