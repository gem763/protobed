He is free on his own recognizance.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors have said they intend to have up to a dozen other women not associated with the criminal charges testify that Gooding behaved like that with them in similar settings - bars, hotels and restaurants - as far back as 2001.\n\nThe judge, Curtis Farber, said he\u2019ll rule in December on whether any of those women can take the witness stand.\n\nHeller has argued the case against Gooding is an example of the #MeToo movement run amok and that overzealous prosecutors are looking to turn \u201ccommonplace gestures\u201d into crimes.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr. faces a new accuser and new charges in his New York City sexual misconduct case, his lawyer said Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael R.
