Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the President\u2019s personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine.'\n\nBut he added that the team had a choice when it came to getting Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky a White House meeting: 'We could abandon the goal of a White House meeting for President Zelensky, which we all believed was crucial to strengthening U.S.-Ukrainian ties and furthering long-held U.S. foreign policy goals in the region; or we could do as President Trump directed and talk to Mr. Giuliani to address the President\u2019s concerns.'\n\nAnd he testified he did not understand at the time that Giuliani wanted the Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rival Joe Biden.\n\n'I did not understand, until much later, that Mr. Giuliani\u2019s agenda might have also included an effort to prompt the Ukrainians to investigate Vice President Biden or his son or to involve Ukrainians, directly or indirectly, in the President\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign,' he said.\n\n'I do not recall that Mr. Giuliani discussed Former Vice President Biden or his son Hunter Biden with me,' he said.\n\nHe also claimed he didn't know Hunter Biden was on the board of the Ukrainian gas company.\n\n'I did not know until more recent press reports that Hunter Biden was on the board of Burisma. Again, I recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens,' he said.\n\nEU Ambassador Gordon Sundland will criticize President Trump for involving Rudy Giuliani in Ukraine policy\n\nSondland testified he involved Rudy Giuliani in Ukrainian matters because President Trump asked him to\n\n'Let me state clearly: Inviting a foreign government to undertake investigations for the purpose of influencing an upcoming U.S. election would be wrong. Withholding foreign aid in order to pressure a foreign government to take such steps would be wrong,' he said.\n\nHe also said he was not on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. He claimed he did not know the Bidens came up until he read the transcript.\n\n'I was not on that July 25, 2019 call and I did not see a transcript of that call until September 25, 2019, when the White House publicly released it. None of the brief and general call summaries I received contained any mention of Burisma or former Vice President Biden, nor even suggested that President Trump had made any kind of request of President Zelensky. I had heard afterwards that the July 25, 2019 call went well,' he said.\n\nIn his testimony he also addressed a successful effort by Giuliani to oust Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who objected to his work. Yovanovitch testified before lawmakers earlier this week.\n\n'I worked with Ambassador Yovanovitch personally during my first official visit to Ukraine in February 2019, and I found her to be an excellent diplomat with a deep command of Ukrainian internal dynamics, the U.S.-Ukraine relationship, and associated regional issues. She was a delight to work with during our visit to Odessa, Ukraine. I was never a part of any campaign to disparage or dislodge her, and I regretted her departure,' Sondland said.\n\nSondland arrived to testify on Capitol Hill Thursday as it was revealed he held a meeting at the White House where he specifically mentioned a Ukrainian gas company that had Hunter Biden on its board as part of negotiations in getting the Ukrainian president a meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nThat meeting happened steps from the White House Situation Room and followed a larger meeting in the West Wing when then-National Security Adviser John Bolton was non-committal on a sit down between the two leaders, NBC News reported.\n\nSondland contradicted Bolton and told Ukrainian officials Trump would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky on the condition he open a corruption investigation involving the Bidens.\n\nBolton abruptly ended the meeting, NBC reported.\n\nThat's when Sondland invited the Ukrainians to a private meeting where he mentioned Bursima Holdings, which had Hunter Biden on its board.\n\nPresident Trump's Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland arrived on Capitol Hill Thursday to testify before lawmakers in a closed-door session\n\nAmbassador Sondland was part of conversations about U.S. policy in the Ukraine\n\nIt was a Sondland meeting at the White House with Ukrainian officials that prompted then-National Security Adviser John Bolton to have White House lawyers notified\n\nSondland was part of discussions about arranging a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelensky - the two leaders are seen together in New York in September during UN week\n\nIt was Sondland's condition that prompted Bolton to direct National Security Council aide Fiona Hill to report the situation to White House lawyers, as she testified this week on Capitol Hill.\n\nSondland addressed the White House meeting in his opening statement but did not mention the report he brought up Burisma to the Ukrainians.\n\n'If Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, or others harbored any misgivings about the propriety of what we were doing, they never shared those misgivings with me, then or later,' he said of their effort to arrange a meeting between Trump and Zelensky.\n\n'We had regular communications with the NSC about Ukraine, both before and after the July meeting; and neither Ambassador Bolton, Dr. Hill, nor anyone else on the NSC staff ever expressed any concerns to me about our efforts, any complaints about coordination between State and the NSC, or, most importantly, any concerns that we were acting improperly,' he said.\n\nThe details of the meeting would undercut a text Sondland sent diplomats discussing the sit down between the two leaders, where the EU ambassador wrote 'The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.'\n\nSondland addressed several of the text messages written between diplomats as they worked to arrange the Trump-Zelensky sit down.\n\nHe argued it was appropriate for the Ukraine to release a public statement about fighting corruption as part of the condition for Zelensky meeting with President Trump.\n\n'I knew that a public embrace of anti-corruption reforms by Ukraine was one of the pre-conditions for securing a White House meeting with President Zelensky. My view was, and has always been, that such Western reforms are consistent with U.S. support for rule of law in Ukraine going back decades, under both Republican and Democrat administrations. Nothing about that request raised any red flags for me, Ambassador Volker, or Ambassador Taylor,' he said in his opening statement.\n\n'Consequently, I supported the efforts of Ambassador Volker to encourage the Ukrainian government to adopt a public statement setting out its reform priorities. My recollection is that the statement was written primarily by the Ukrainians with Ambassador Volker\u2019s guidance, and I offered my assistance when asked. This was the \u201cdeliverable\u201d referenced in some of my messages \u2013 a deliverable/public statement that President Trump wanted to see or hear before a White House meeting could occur. The fact that we were working on this public statement was not a secret,' he said.\n\nHe also addressed a text message he sent to Bill Taylor, the highest ranking U.S. official in the Ukraine, that said 'call me' when Taylor questioned whether American aid to the Ukraine was conditional on an investigation by the Ukraines.\n\n'Any implication that I was trying to avoid making a record of our conversation is completely false. In my view, diplomacy is best handled through back-and-forth conversation. The complexity of international relations cannot be adequately expressed in cryptic text messages. I simply prefer to talk rather than to text. I do this all the time with family, friends, and former business associates. That is how I most effectively get things done,' Sondland said.\n\n'I do not recall any discussions with the White House on withholding U.S. security assistance from Ukraine in return for assistance with the President\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. I recall that, in late July 2019, Ambassadors Volker and Taylor and I exchanged emails in which we all agreed that President Zelensky should have no involvement in 2020 U.S. Presidential election politics,' he said.\n\nHe also said he called President Trump after Taylor texted his concerns to ask if there was a quid pro quo in the works.\n\n'I asked the President: \u201cWhat do you want from Ukraine?\u201d The President responded, \u201cNothing. There is no quid pro quo.\u201d The President repeated: \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d multiple times. This was a very short call. And I recall the President was in a bad mood,' he said.\n\nTrump blocked Sondland's scheduled appearance last week and Democrats subpoenaed the ambassador, the latest in a series of witnesses to testify behind closed doors on Capitol Hill as the impeachment inquiry heats up.\n\nSondland is the latest in a series of witnesses to testify on Capitol Hill; NSC aide Fiona Hill, above, testified about Sondland's White House meeting on Monday\n\nSondland will be asked about allegations Trump threatened to with hold U.S. aid unless Ukraine investigated Joe and Hunter Biden\n\nThe text messages - offered by Ukrainian special envoy Kurt Volker as part of his testimony to Congress - show the diplomats discussing an arrangement in which Zelensky would be offered a White House visit in exchange for a public statement that committed the Ukraine to investigate the 2016 presidential election and Burisma Holdings.\n\nBill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine, told Sondland in the texts it was 'crazy' to with hold the aid in exchange for 'help with a political campaign.'\n\n'Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u2019 Taylor said in a September 1 text message.\n\n\u2018Call me,\u2019 replied Sondland \u2013 taking the discussion offline.\n\nIn more online pushback, Taylor tells Sondland days later on September 9: \u2018As I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u2019\n\nThat prompted a formal and lengthy response from Sondland: \u2018Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign I suggest we stop the back and forth by text If you still have concerns I recommend you give Lisa Kenna or S a call to discuss them directly. Thanks.\u2019\n\nSondland is expected to tell lawmakers that Trump told him by phone before he sent the text that there was no quid pro quo and that he was simply repeating that to Taylor.\n\nHe is also expected to testify that Trump gave his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani authority to approve a presidential meeting with Zelensky.\n\nThe central role Trump provided for Giuliani is the latest disclosure about a shadow Trump administration policy on Ukraine outside of the normal chain of command.\n\nGordon Sondland, the United States Ambassador to the European Union, will testify that President Trump told him it was up to Rudy Giuliani to approve a meeting between Trump and the president of Ukraine\n\nSondland, who was a key figure in communications about handling Ukraine policy, also will testify he met in the Oval Office with Trump, U.S. Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry after he attended Zelensky's inauguration, NBC News reported.\n\nA Trump-Zelensky meeting, which Zelensky is described as keen to have occur to shore up his own position, would need to get a green light from Giuliani to occur, Sondland will say.\n\nDemocrats expect him to provide crucial information about pressure for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens at a time when the Trump administration was holding back $391 million in U.S. security aid to Ukraine.\n\nNational security official Fiona Hill testified Monday that former National Security Director John Bolton called Giuliani 'hand grenade who's going to blow everyone up.'\n\nAs Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani has spent months seeking to dig up dirt on Joe Biden's son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine. Hunter Biden took a lucrative post on a board of a Ukrainian energy company, but told ABC News Tuesday he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nPresident Trump had his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani working as a key emissary for Ukraine policy\n\nTwo Giuliani associates were indicted last week on campaing finance charges. The former New York mayor says he got $500,000 for consulting work he did for them\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said while sitting next to Trump at a press conference that Trump didn't put any pressure on him to investigate the Bidens\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted two Giuliani associates last week on campaign finance violations.\n\nGiuliani told Reuters this week he was paid $500,000 to work for Fraud Guarantee, the company co-founded by Ukraine-born Lev Parnas, who authorities accuse of steering hundreds of thousands of dollars from another source to a pro-Trump super PAC.\n\nLawmakers consider Sondland a key witness due to his proximity to Trump \u2013 the former real estate executive gave $1 million to Trump's inauguration \u2013 and his interaction with other officials on Ukraine at a time when a whistle-blower says the White House was pushing Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nHe is the latest witness as Democrats press forward in their impeachment investigation.\n\nA career diplomat, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs George Kent, testified on Capitol Hill Tuesday. He previously served as deputy chief of mission in Kiev from 2015 to 2018.\n\nMichael McKinley, a senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who resigned his post last week amid the reverberations of the Ukraine scandal, testified Wednesday.\n\nCounselor of the United States Department of State Ulrich Brechbuhl, a close advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, testifies on Thursday.\n\nLaura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia and Ukraine is set to testify to three congressional committees on Friday.\n\nNext week lawmakers will hear from: Bill Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine; Philip Reeker, acting assistant secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs; Alexander Vindman, director of European affairs at the National Security Council; Suriya Jayanti, Foreign Service officer in Kiev, and Tim Morrison, senior director for Russia at the National Security Council.", "description": "U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland will testify on Capitol Hill Thursday as it was revealed he mentioned a Ukrainian gas company with ties to Hunter Biden in meeting with Ukrainians.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19840868-0-image-a-35_1571321200936.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
