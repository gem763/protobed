His post went viral, attracting thousands of comments and becoming one of the most searched items on Weibo last week.\n\nThe trader, who declined to give his name, said such price swings were not unusual in the speculative world of cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.\n\n\"But it's clear sneaker speculators were pulling money out of the market\" after the Chinese government and netizens responded angrily to the comment by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, he said.\n\nMorey quickly deleted his tweet, but the damage was done.\n\nChinese state media started to attack him, the Houston Rockets and the National Basketball Association (NBA), accusing them of endorsing violence and peddling a \"secessionist pipe dream.\"\n\nSince the incident, quotes for tokens backed by the Air Jordan 1 Retro High Satin Black Toe shoes - the latest variant of the iconic 1980s model - have fallen 34%, according to Reuters calculations based on data from 55.com, a major global exchange for asset-backed tokens.\n\nIn China, the trading of tokens and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is banned, but Chinese investors are active on overseas exchanges. On 55.com, traders can exchange yuan for cryptocurrencies such as Tether via Alipay or WeChat to acquire tokens.\n\nIt is also possible on 55.com to trade tokens backed by other designer merchandise such as hoodies by Supreme, a U.S. clothing brand under the Carlyle Group.\n\nHong Kong-based George Gao, a sneaker brand influencer in China with more than 38,000 followers on his YouTube channel, said the NBA backlash among mainland basketball fans was \"unprecedented.\"\n\nGlobal brands can suffer when they offend their client base in China, where millions of online citizens rapidly respond to perceived cultural slights or insults to the country. For NBA, the China market is estimated to be worth more than $4 billion.\n\nLast week, Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike stores in major Chinese cities.\n\nPoizon and DoNew, two Chinese mobile shopping apps popular among fans of designer sneakers, also took NBA-logo shoes off their platforms, traders said.\n\nXu Xiaotian, an avid sneaker collector in the southern city of Guangzhou, said he would boycott \"anti-China\" brands and take political concerns into consideration during his next purchase.\n\nBut he also said individual NBA players were not directly involved in the controversy.\n\nIn June, Xu bought online a pair of Nike Air Jordan 1 Retro High \"Pass The Torch\" sneakers inspired by the Los Angeles Clippers' Kawhi Leonard. Xu paid 13,000 yuan ($1,837.85) and sold them for 33,000 yuan that month.\n\nXu said he would invest in NBA shoes again despite his feelings about the NBA.\n\nLeBron James - a star player for the Los Angeles Lakers and widely considered to be the face of the NBA - weighed in on the controversy on Monday, saying Morey \"wasn't educated\" when he sent a tweet in support of protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nOn mobile app Sneaker Sale Calendar, a popular tool for sneaker price comparison among Chinese collectors, the price of Nike's LeBron 16 \"MPLS\" shoes rose 142% to 1,944 yuan on Wednesday from a day earlier.\n\nOther brands associated with the NBA, such as Nike and Adidas, have been largely unscathed.\n\nGao said the price of a new pair of limited-edition Nike shoes in collaboration with U.S. rapper Travis Scott, which made their debut in China on Friday, surged more than fivefold to almost 8,000 yuan from 1,399 yuan in online resale markets.\n\n\"Political factors do affect my choice,\" said Chen Luwei, a Chinese sneaker fan studying in Australia.\n\n\"If there is any insulting speech by Nike or Adidas, it may affect my decision to buy their shoes,\" Chen said. \"But I can't just throw away my previous ones, right?\"\n\n($1 = 7.0735 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Yawen Chen, Ryan Woo; Additional Reporting by Beijing Newsroom and Se Young Lee; Editing by Gerry Doyle)", "description": "By Yawen Chen and Ryan WooBEIJING, Oct 16 (Reuters) - On Oct. 4, a Chinese trader noticed a sharp drop in the price of crypto tokens backed by Nike's Air...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
