What's going to happen in the interval and will there be elections in Great Britain?\"\n\nFrance's minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said Paris was open to a Brexit delay \"of a few days ... to allow the British parliament to finish its procedure.\"\n\nAmbassadors from EU member states were to meet later Wednesday in Brussels to begin the decision-making procedure, but no response is expected before Friday.\n\nDelay everything\n\n\"My impression is the meeting will serve to have a first picture where individual member states stand,\" an EU diplomat told AFP.\n\n\"The position of Tusk is known but some others want a short-term extension,\" he said.\n\nTusk wants the EU leaders to approve the January 31 extension \"by written procedure\", but -- officials said -- if the members' positions are far apart, an emergency summit could be held on Monday next week.\n\nAs it stands, without their unanimous agreement, Britain is due to crash out of the EU in eight days' time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson told MPs that if parliament decided to \"delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\n\"We will have to go forward to a general election. I will argue at that election: let's get Brexit done.\"\n\nA three-month delay would give time to hold a general election before the New Year - though calling the vote would require the support of two-thirds of MPs.\n\nThe Labour main opposition has spurned two previous chances to call an election.\n\nThe Britain Elects poll aggregator puts the Conservatives on 35%, Labour on 25%, the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats on 18%, the Brexit Party on 11% and the Greens on four percent.\n\nPolling expert John Curtice told BBC radio that the polls are moving in favour of Johnson's Conservatives putting him on course for a small but relatively comfortable 20 seat majority.\n\n46 years of integration\n\nBusinesses and markets on both sides of the Channel fear a no-deal scenario, where Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no new plans in place after 46 years of integration.\n\nIn the June 2016 EU referendum, 52% of voters in the UK backed leaving the bloc, but MPs three times rejected a divorce deal struck by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May.\n\nJohnson, who took office in July, defied expectations in striking a revised deal last Thursday - and seemed relieved that MPs voted positively for it to be considered further.\n\nIt covers EU citizens' rights, Britain's financial settlements, a post-Brexit transition period until at least the end of 2020 and new trade arrangements for Northern Ireland", "description": "European leaders are deciding whether to postpone Brexit and for how long, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson's eyes have turned towards a snap general election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9450/3a3fecda44c84b0b994a7420741351c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
