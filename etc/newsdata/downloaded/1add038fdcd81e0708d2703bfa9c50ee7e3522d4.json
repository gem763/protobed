(AP) \u2014 The Latest on the Florida Senate's debate over ouster of Broward County Sheriff (all times local):\n\n10 p.m.\n\nA divided legislative panel has sided with Florida's Republican governor in removing a county sheriff accused of mishandling the response to a school shooting that killed 17 people.\n\nThe mostly party line vote by Florida's Senate Rules Committee sends the matter to the full chamber, which is expected to consider it Wednesday.\n\nThe highly charged session was a victory for Gov. Ron DeSantis, who suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel just days after taking office in January. DeSantis faulted Israel's handling of the Feb. 14, 2018, shootings that took the lives of 15 students and two staffers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.\n\nThe committee rejected the recommendation of an official the Senate had appointed to investigate the suspension. That investigator, former state Rep. Dudley Goodlette, concluded that DeSantis was wrong to remove the sheriff from his job.\n\n___\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe tragedy of the Parkland school massacre framed a developing political drama Monday in Florida's capital, as the state Senate began considering whether to reinstate a county sheriff over the objections of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nJust days after taking office in January, DeSantis suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, faulting the lawman's handling of the Feb. 14, 2018, shootings that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nIf the Republican majority Senate sides with DeSantis it would be rejecting the recommendation of an official it appointed to investigate the suspension. That investigator, former state Rep. Dudley Goodlette, concluded that DeSantis was wrong to remove the sheriff from his job.\n\n4:46 p.m.\n\nThe Florida Senate began a special session Monday to decide whether it will reinstate a county sheriff suspended by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over the handling of last year's Parkland school shootings that killed 17 people.\n\nFor the Republican majority Senate, siding with DeSantis will mean going against the recommendation of an official appointed to investigate the suspension of Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel. It's an awkward position, especially since the governor will have control of bills and budget items the lawmakers will eventually send his way during the 2020 legislative session.\n\nFormer State Rep. Dudley Goodlette was appointed by the Senate to make a recommendation on whether Israel should be permanently removed from his elected office.\n\n10 a.m.\n\nThe Florida Senate began a special session Monday to decide whether it will reinstate a county sheriff suspended by Gov. Ron DeSantis over the handling of last year's Parkland school shootings that killed 17 people.\n\nThe Senate met briefly to open the session as relatives of Parkland victims watched from the public gallery. The Rules Committee was to meet later Monday in what was expected to be a marathon session. The meeting is scheduled to run from 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. before members vote to make a recommendation to the full Senate on whether to reinstate Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\n\nDeSantis suspended Israel in January as one of his first acts after taking office, accusing the sheriff of neglect of duty and incompetence in his handling of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February 2018. An official appointed by the Senate to investigate the suspension recommended that Israel be reinstated. That puts the Republican majority Senate in the awkward position of deciding whether or not to buck the governor's wishes.\n\n9 a.m.\n\nThe Florida Senate is reconvening in a special session to begin debating whether it will reinstate a county sheriff dismissed by Gov. Ron DeSantis over the handling of last year's Parkland school shootings that killed 17 people.\n\nDeSantis is standing by his decision to boot former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel despite a recommendation by a special master to reinstate former Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.\n\nThe special session presents an awkward situation for Senate Republicans who appointed the special master to look into Israel's firing but must also weigh whether they will go buck the wishes of the governor, a fellow Republican.\n\nDeSantis has expressed displeasure over Israel's handling of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n\nIsrael contends his dismissal was politically motivated.", "description": "A divided legislative panel has sided with Florida's Republican governor in removing a county sheriff accused of mishandling the response to a school shooting that killed 17 people.
