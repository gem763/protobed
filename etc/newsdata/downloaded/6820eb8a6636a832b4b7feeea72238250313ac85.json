No more avoiding the chopping block because somebody re-injured his football foot. It was time for America and Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and \u2014 well, look who\u2019s here, it\u2019s a lippy Leah Remini! \u2014 to send someone home.\n\nIt\u2019s curtain time!\n\nView photos DANCING WITH THE STARS - More\n\nLamar Odom and Peta Murgatroyd: The baller garnered major respect and empathy for his struggles on the dance floor, but his Viennese waltz \u2014 however tender and sweet \u2014 was not enough to keep him out of last place. \u201cI\u2019m getting emotional, Lamar, because I don\u2019t know if everybody knows how hard you work and how hard this is for you,\u201d said Remini, who had zero patience for the pair of 4s given by Goodman and Tonioli. Totes agree, girl. Score: 20 out of 40\n\nSean Spicer and Lindsay Arnold: Fighting his tendency to look robotic, the former press secretary fist-pumped his way through a Pasodoble that lacked emotion but earned attaboys for its meticulousness. And he got to go first for the night! \u201cYou attacked the dance,\u201d said Goodman. \u201cYou weren\u2019t scared to get out there.\u201d \u201cSean is not a dancer, that\u2019s very clear,\u201d said Remini. \u201cBut what I love about you is that you are committed, you try your best.\u201d Score: 21 out of 40\n\nKate Flannery and Pasha Pashkov: She deserved a perfect score just for admitting \u201cI can\u2019t believe at 55 I get to dance with a hot Russian\u201d during the rehearsal package. Unfortunately, her Argentine tango wasn\u2019t quite as blistering. \u201cFrom the beginning, your energy is amazing and you represent a lot of us,\u201d said Remini. \u201cWe are not dancers. We are comedic actors.\u201d \u201cYou definitely went for it,\u201d added Tonioli. \u201cYou lost balance quite a few times. You lost the smoothness of the Argentine tango.\u201d Score: 26 out of 40\n\nKaramo Brown and Jenna Johnson: The Queer Eye host\u2019s tango earned him the enviable last performance on the show and some serious support from Remini. \u201cYou really turned on that kind of leading man attitude,\u201d said Tonioli. \u201cThere were no mistakes tonight.\u201d \u201cThat was my favorite dance of yours thus far,\u201d added Inaba, who wasn\u2019t keen on the way he lifted Jenna at the start of the number. Remini wasn\u2019t having any of it and \u2014 quelle surprise \u2014 got up in Inaba\u2019s grill. They bickered and mocked each other. Goodman looked annoyed. In other words, someone needs to invite back Remini. But I digress. Score: 28 out of 40\n\nJames Van Der Beek and Emma Slater: God bless the Beek \u2014 and not just because he has a huge brood at home and another on the way. The actor\u2019s quickstep featured a super solo spin and a nifty cart-wheel! Bummer the judges weren\u2019t as impressed as this googly-eyed recapper. \u201cSometimes my scores don\u2019t reflect my feelings. You are a terrific dancer,\u201d Goodman. \u201cI would have liked a little more hold. But it was full of clever choreography.\u201d Added Inaba, \u201cNo doubt about it, that was a great routine \u2026 you are dancing like two soloists.\u201d Score: 28 out of 40\n\nView photos Eric McCandless/ABC More", "description": "Dancing With the Stars recap: Season 28, episode 4", "authors": ["Lynette Rice"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AVlExyHR9UP97dzQpy_Xxg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/entertainment_weekly_785/87d7bede6218c9247b1912870040bda7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
