Kristensen and Korda estimate India maintains three or four nuclear strike squadrons of Cold War-vintage, French-made Mirage 2000H and Jaguar IS/IB aircraft targeted at Pakistan and China.\n\n\u201cDespite the upgrades, the original nuclear bombers are getting old and India is probably searching for a modern fighter-bomber that could potentially take over the air-based nuclear strike role in the future,\u201d the report notes. India is buying thirty-six French Rafale fighters that carry nuclear weapons in French service, and presumably could do for India.\n\nIndia\u2019s nuclear missile force is only fifteen years old, but it already has four types of land-based ballistic missiles: the short-range Prithvi-II and Agni-I, the medium-range Agni-II and the intermediate-range Agni-III. \u201cAt least two other longer-range Agni missiles are under development: the Agni-IV and Agni-V,\u201d says the report. \u201cIt remains to be seen how many of these missile types India plans to fully develop and keep in its arsenal. Some may serve as technology development programs toward longer-range missiles.\u201d\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A large arsenal in a dangerous part of the world.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HdhNYqPOKF99QFjDIITKdw--~B/aD05NTk7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/c94ecf50577add41d24e880b9948007f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
