Manager Phil Neville had called their last two lacklustre friendlies, a loss and a draw to Norway and Belgium, the result of not being over their World Cup semi-final exit in July. But their loss to Brazil yesterday at the Riverside Stadium suggests the Lionesses seem to still be in the dizzying depths of a morning-after-the-night- before.\n\nTwo second-half goals from Brazil's Debinha delivered a bitter-tasting loss to Neville's side, their fourth in their last five matches. Beth England's 80th-minute goal, her first for the senior team, only slightly helped soften the blow, as the team were disorganised in defence for the majority of the second period.\n\nThe last time England failed to win in five games, back in 2013 at the European Championships, coach Hope Powell was sacked. Despite playing down the result, Neville acknowledged the result as a \"wake up call\" to his side to be more clinical as they head into another friendly against Portugal at the Stadio do Bonfim on Tuesday.\n\n\"You can\u2019t be blinkered.
