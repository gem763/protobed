The letters did not elaborate on the content on the complaints, aside from noting that the \"health and safety\" of multiple students was put at risk.\n\nThe eight fraternities that were not reported will be presented with steps to be taken off suspension once the other five are identified, although what those steps will consist of is not yet clear.\n\nNo fraternities will be allowed to participate in OU's Homecoming celebrations next week, nor can any fraternities hold meetings, host activities, or communicate as a group for the time being.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOhio University Athens More\n\nOhio University issued a blanket suspension for all 15 fraternities on campus after a tidal wave of hazing allegations.\n\nDuring the last week of September, both of OU's Greek Life councils held events for National Hazing Prevention Week to explain what hazing was, how one knows if they're being hazed, and how to report hazing. The next week, seven hazing allegations were submitted against seven different fraternities within three days.\n\nAs a result, every member of the university's Interfraternity Council was suspended, the ACACIA and Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternities were issued cease-and-desist letters, and the rest of the fraternities are waiting for the next five accused of hazing to be named. The next round of letters is expected to be sent within days.\n\nThe cease-and-desist letters did not specify what kind of hazing occurred, just noted that the \"health and safety\" of multiple students had been put at risk. Only fraternities were affected. Under the suspension, fraternities cannot hold meetings, host activities, or communicate as a group. No fraternities will take part in OU's Homecoming celebrations next week, but sororities will still participate as planned.\n\nIn a statement, OU's Dean of Students wrote, \"It is deeply troubling that seven of our Interfraternity Council (IFC) chapters have been or will be under investigation this semester for possible violations of the University's Student Code of Conduct.\"\n\nA Hazing Prevention Task Force had been formed the week before the suspensions, which were preceded by an alleged hazing death\n\nohio university More\n\nFlicker/Hope Moore/C.C. by 3.0\n\nImmediately after the suspensions were announced, false reports that fraternity houses were being raided and that members were being arrested or forced to leave fraternity houses spread online. No direct action was taken against any student or fraternity besides the cease-and-desist letters, but no one was required to leave fraternity housing.\n\nA Hazing Prevention Task Force consisting of faculty and Greek Life students was formed by the Office of Student Affairs the week prior to the hazing allegation submissions. The group has met since but is waiting for the other five fraternity cease-and-desist letters to be sent before forming an action plan.", "description": "After OU sororities and fraternities held National Hazing Prevention Week events, 7 allegations against separate fraternities were brought forward.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VlrgsoB3Vt_iSKUvmt3Apw--~B/aD0xNjg2O3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/a946546e5ccdc9f3cbb0cef5bb77eb7d", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
