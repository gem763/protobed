Yes.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut maybe not quite the type being sought by the Hendrick Motorsports star, who recently spoke of once being \u201cfeared\u201d on the track.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case with Hamlin, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, if he thought I was a threat, he wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Johnson said with a laugh about Hamlin\u2019s move. \u201cSo there is respect there. And I do feel there is respect off the track, but out there on the track, there is just another level of respect you have to earn through racing hard. And I guess because I didn\u2019t seem like a threat, he let that slide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it! I\u2019m very appreciative. I don\u2019t want to have it come across the wrong way, but if we\u2019d been leading all day long, I don\u2019t think he would have cut us that break.\u201d\n\nJohnson still made the most of it over the final half of the race. Restarting in 20th, he drove into the top five over the next 100 laps (capitalizing on a two-tire stop with 20 laps remaining.\n\nHe faded to a 10th-place finish over the last three restarts \u2013 but it still was a major improvement after running outside the top 15 for most of the first two stages.\n\n\u201cWe just finally got the car tightened up,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe were so loose, I just couldn\u2019t run the amount of throttle needed.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cOnce we got the car closer, I drove up to (the top five) and passed a ton of cars. That was cool. On the end with two tires, a lot of guys were on four, so that hurt us a little bit. We didn\u2019t need those last few cautions. I think we were sitting in a great spot, and then the cautions started, and that caught us off.\u201d\n\nStill, the big break came from Hamlin. Though Johnson would have gotten back on the lead lap via the free pass, staying on the lead lap allowed him to avoid starting behind lapped cars on the ensuing restart.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very thankful that he was so considerate,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where that came from, but I\u2019m very, very appreciative of it. He harassed me in a tweet a while back and mentioned something along the lines of the utmost respect, so there is a lot of respect there. I appreciate that.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t got to see what all was aired but pretty certain I actually said 7x champ somewhere in there. Ahh the things we say on the battle field \u2014 Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) July 17, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was during the July 13 race at Kentucky Speedway when Hamlin complained about being held up by Johnson on track.\n\nBut as he has mentioned often this season (and often since his spin of Chase Elliott racing for the lead at Martinsville Speedway might have cost him a chance for the championship), the Joe Gibbs Racing driver has been rather chivalrous at times with his No. 11 Toyota.\n\n\u201cJust trying to be a nice guy,\u201d Hamlin said of declining to keep Johnson a lap down. \u201cNever can have too many friends out there, especially this point of the season. You go a lap down, it changes your race. Obviously he was up there racing in the top five there towards the end.\n\n\u201cJust putting another coin in the deposit box.\u201d", "description": "The seven-time Cup champion was appreciative that the race winner helped put him in position to drive through the field.", "authors": ["Nate Ryan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JGoakJPkEYqwpMJyYoRJ3w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/R02Y_Lhy9pBp3CGsUByL9A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/08c65a12b6302c2d505088413cabb093", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
