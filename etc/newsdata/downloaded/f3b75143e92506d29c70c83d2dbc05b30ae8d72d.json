It\u2019s no good if a client or a regulator says, 'why did you buy that stock?' You can\u2019t say, 'the computer said so.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to fly, so there needs to be some transparency to the process and I\u2019ve spent my career explaining how we do not build black boxes. Open up the lid and I can tell you how it works.\"\n\n'Make yourself redundant'\n\nMr Smith\u2019s working life to date has been based at the intersection of technology and markets.\n\n\u201cThe day I joined the company I was told: 'Your job is to make yourself redundant. Automate away what you are doing and get the computer to do that and we will find you something more interesting to do.' We have never been short of ever-more interesting things to do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile technology is improving all the time, that development doesn\u2019t obviate the need for professional fund managers, he believes. \u201cModels don\u2019t have complete information,\u201d Mr Smith said. Brexit and \"those kinds of events\" justify the continued existence of investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot all markets have welcomed technological advances, but Australia is among those that have, Mr Smith said.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, we have found that people are more open to those ideas. It\u2019s tied up with a drive to lower fees and efficiencies associated with that. There is a comfort level with quantitative. It\u2019s a more technical market on the whole, so people are more open to the idea of using quantitative.\n\n\u201cWe see something similar in the Nordic markets. It\u2019s less of the case in the UK,\u201d the London-based investment manager said. \u201cWe still have traditional boards. They want to look their managers in the whites of their eyes and expect the managers to look at their investee companies in the whites of their eyes.\u201d\n\nCrowded trades?\n\nA common criticism lobbed at computer-driven trading and investing is that it can lead to crowded trades, where investors head for the same corners of the market at the same time.\n\nBut Mr Smith believes crowded trades are more of an issue for the passive end of the spectrum than \u201csmart-beta\u201d, which falls somewhere in between the passive end and the active part of the market.\n\n\u201cI think that the impact of quantitative is less than the impact of passive. I still think there is this weight of assets, there has been a shift to smart beta, but it\u2019s in infancy.\n\n\u201cI think that creates a certain type of inefficiency in the market that does create risks. I rely on other active managers out there moving prices around so that it creates efficiencies and opportunities,\u201d he said, emphasising that investors shouldn\u2019t conflate passive investing and automation.", "description": "Asset prices are high, interest rates are low and investors wonder how long markets will stay calm.
