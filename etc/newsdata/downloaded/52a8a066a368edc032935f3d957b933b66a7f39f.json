REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nFrench Open champion Barty, who had been beaten twice by Kvitova in Australia earlier this year, fired nine aces and converted three of six break points to win the encounter.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the highest quality matches I played all year,\u201d Barty told reporters. \u201cPetra always has a way of bringing out the best in me, she really does.\n\n\u201cFrom both of us, I think the level was incredible. Regardless of winning or losing, I think I\u2019d be sitting here with the exact same perspective, kind of the same feeling of the match afterwards.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kvitova, a two-times Wimbledon champion, fired 36 winners to Barty\u2019s 31, her unforced error count of 28 proved to be her downfall.\n\nThe Czech saved three match points when Barty served for the match at 5-3 in the decider but the Australian fought back to deuce and then fired a crosscourt forehand winner to move into the tournament\u2019s semis for the first time in her career.\n\nBarty will face eighth seed Kiki Bertens, who upset third seed Elina Svitolina 7-6(6) 6-2.\n\nIn another battle of Grand Slam champions, Japan\u2019s Naomi Osaka beat U.S. Open holder Bianca Andreescu 5-7 6-3 6-4 in a thrilling encounter, ending the Canadian\u2019s 17-match winning streak to book her place in the semi-finals.\n\n\u201cI forgot how it felt and honestly it sucks, I didn\u2019t miss it,\u201d Andreescu said after her first loss since the Miami Open in March and her first loss against a top 10 opponent. \u201cHopefully that was fun.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to have many matches like this. Our game styles are pretty different, but they level up pretty equally.\u201d\n\nOsaka fired 10 aces, 31 winners and won 78% of her first service points in a see-saw encounter that had a total of 11 breaks of serve. She will play defending champion Caroline Wozniacki, who beat Russia\u2019s Daria Kasatkina 6-3 7-6(5).\n\nOsaka became the fifth player to qualify for the season-ending WTA Finals in Shenzhen after Barty, Karolina Pliskova, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep and Andreescu.", "description": "World number one Ash Barty battled back from a set down to beat Czech Republic's seventh seed Petra Kvitova 4-6 6-4 6-3 to advance to the semi-finals of the China Open in Beijing on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437097409&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF931AU-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
