Then came the fateful word that would launch thousands of irate social media posts, draw headlines across the country and force school administrators to place a teacher under investigation: \u201cIdiot.\u201d\n\nUnderneath the question, the quiz listed four options: Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Few online had difficulty identifying what was meant to be the correct answer.\n\nAfter a parent contacted Watson B. Duncan Middle School in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., to complain about the question, principal Phillip D\u2019Amico took swift action: he \u201creassigned\u201d the teacher who gave the quiz and launched an investigation into the matter, according to an email D\u2019Amico sent to parents.\n\n\u201cThe question was inappropriate, and demonstrated an unacceptable lack of good judgement on the part of the teacher,\u201d D\u2019Amico wrote in the email, which he provided to The Washington Post. \u201cI apologize for the incident, and for the offensive verbiage used in the question.\u201d\n\n[Trump-supporting cheerleaders were going to take the field. Then security issues arose.]\n\nD\u2019Amico declined to comment beyond the email, though he confirmed the investigation is ongoing. The teacher who gave the quiz was not named in his email and has not been publicly identified.\n\nThe kerfuffle in Florida comes as school testing across the country is increasingly making the news \u2014 for all the wrong reasons, according to education experts. A few months ago, Boston officials dropped a standardized test question after many derided it as racist; earlier this month, a middle school teacher in Long Island was placed under investigation after asking students to \u201cwrite something funny\u201d under pictures of enslaved people.\n\nIn part, teachers may be making these kinds of missteps because the American political environment is increasingly tumultuous and divisive, experts said.\n\nJoshua Starr, the chief executive of PDK International, a membership association for educators, said he\u2019s seen more teacher errors like the Florida question in the past few years than ever before in his 26 years working in education. Starr, though he cautioned that \u201cracist\u201d questions like the Long Island item are different \u2014 and more egregious \u2014 than quiz queries revealing personal political beliefs, said neither has a place in the classroom.\n\nBut he has a theory about why they\u2019re sneaking in, anyway.\n\n\u201cWe know people are more polarized now than ever before, and it may be causing teachers to act stupid,\" Starr said. \u201cOne thing we do know for sure is that social media has heightened awareness of it: people have the ability, now, to distribute so widely on Facebook, Twitter, whatever.\u201d\n\n[SAT question on reality TV stirs controversy]\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how things played out at Watson B. Duncan Middle School. The angry parent didn\u2019t just complain to administrators \u2014 he also took to Twitter to vent his frustration.\n\nPalm Beach Gardens father Cam Cary found out about the quiz question earlier this week from his daughter, a student at Duncan, according to his social media posts. The same day she took the quiz, Cary tweeted out a picture of the offending question and vowed he would \u201craise some hell with the principle.\"\n\n\u201cThis was an actual question on my daughters middle school test today. Furious,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIndoctrination will not continue ... Not having it!\u201d\n\nCary could not be reached for comment. His Twitter account says he is a \u201cConservative\u201d father of three and includes the hashtags, \u201c#NRA\", \u201c#Americafirst\u201d and \u201c#MAGA2020.\u201d\n\nAfter sending the initial tweet \u2014 which has since garnered more than 7,800 likes and 5,800 retweets \u2014 Cary began \u201ccollecting facts, documenting and contacting the right people prior to contacting the school board,\u201d according to his Twitter posts.\n\nAt some point, he appears to have contacted administrators, who took steps to remedy the situation \u2014 including facilitating a \u201clong talk\u201d between the principal and Cary, according to Cary\u2019s posts.\n\nSoon after that, D\u2019Amico sent the email announcing the investigation and the teacher\u2019s reassignment.\n\n\u201cI let the school know that teachers personal opinions do not belong in the classroom no matter what you believe,\u201d Cary tweeted. \u201cThat kids need to be free thinkers and not told how to think.\"\n\n[Trump signs executive order on free speech on college campuses]\n\nStarr agreed, noting that \u201cpersonal politics, teachers shouldn\u2019t bring that in,\" regardless of what\u2019s going on in the American political landscape. The Florida teacher clearly erred, he said, and added he believes the middle school reacted appropriately in disciplining the educator.\n\nAlthough Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, also believes the teacher made a mistake, she was less certain about the validity of the punishment.\n\n\u201cNone of us are perfect, but we have to be culturally sensitive and culturally appropriate,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cThough it\u2019s tough to call out the teacher when at the exact same time, every single day in the president\u2019s Twitter feed, he\u2019s being completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nThe temptation for frustrated teachers to vent their political feelings and views to students is probably not going away any time soon, Starr said.\n\nHe offered a few suggestions for teachers and school administrators across America. First, \u201cknow the rules\u201d about free speech \u2014 that every student should be able to voice their opinion, no matter what it is \u2014 and make those rules clear to everyone in your school, Starr said.\n\nSecond, \u201cengage educators in discussions about this stuff\u201d to make sure everyone is aware that it\u2019s unacceptable for teachers to express personal political views, Starr said. These discussions should also allow teachers to air their \u201cconcerns, fears and hopes,\" and for the entire staff to develop a \u201cunified approach\u201d to handling controversial political issues in the classroom, according to Starr.\n\nHe gave a final tip for teachers \u2014 whether Trump supporters or opponents \u2014 feeling especially enraged by political goings-on.\n\n\u201cDo 10 push ups and don\u2019t use social media,\u201d Starr said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to stay off social media.\u201d", "description": "\u201c45th Pres; 2017; Republican; Real Estate businessman;\u201d the quiz question read.
