Now, the North Pole has become the blank canvas for the artist\u2019s own imagined mythology \u2014 what she calls \u201can old-school, Ovidian story of metamorphosis,\u201d which has earned her a Frieze Artist Award. At the London fair in early October, she will show \u201cWe Are Opposite Like That II\u201d (2019), a fantastical film that offers a feminist answer to masculine explorer narratives and colonial unease, and which meditates on ice as an archive of stories that risk being lost to glacial melt. (The film will also be broadcast on the U.K.\u2019s Channel 4 this fall.) Singh Soin herself plays an equatorial, tropical creature who transforms into ice: a figment of the Victorian imagination, perhaps, but also an agent who animates and awakens the permafrost to become a \u201cvibrant, living, breathing\u201d entity.\n\nThe artist, 32, grew up in Delhi and attended university in the United States and London, but her relationship with the Arctic extends back to her childhood. Her father is an explorer, and not long after she was born, he traveled to the Arctic to study the erosion of the ozone layer. Her parents founded a travel company together, and Singh Soin makes annual expeditions with her family to \u201cthe edges of the mainstream map,\u201d as she puts it, where she collects folklore, sand, seeds and imagery.\n\nIn one way or another, Singh Soin says, all of her work is \u201cabout creating speculations or alternate cosmologies.\u201d She\u2019s drawn to fantastical writers like Italo Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, and folk stories like the Buddhist Jataka tales from India. While aboard the Arctic-bound ship, she quickly became absorbed by the \u201chistory of conjecture\u201d that has taken root in the North Pole, the theories that have settled there. \u201cI was reading about the history of the Arctic, and I immediately loved the idea that the Arctic and Antarctic may have been tropical paradises in the past, that they were teeming with mosquitoes and dinosaurs.\u201d In response, she began to invoke what she describes as her own \u201calienness\u201d in the Arctic, by bringing symbols of her home up onto the deck \u2014 an orchid, or a pineapple.", "description": "Inspired by her own journey to the Arctic Circle, Himali Singh Soin upends traditional stories of exploration in her new commission for Frieze.", "authors": ["Tess Thackara"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/t-magazine/art/27tmag-himali-slide-XR4Q/27tmag-himali-slide-XR4Q-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
