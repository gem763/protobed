I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d\n\nBarcelona were without a game at the weekend following the postponement of El Clasico for security reasons, while Valverde handed 16-year-old Ansu Fati his second league start.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an excessive match, but I think we played well,\u201d added Valverde, whose side play at Levante on Saturday before next Tuesday\u2019s home Champions League tie against Slavia Prague.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a week of three matches and it was important to start it well.\n\n\u201cWe have a big squad and all the players are fighting to play. There are players who deserve to play but can\u2019t always do so. We will be managing the group.\u201d\n\nValladolid had been unbeaten in their previous five matches and manager Sergio Gonzalez urged his players to keep their heads high.\n\n\u201cWe did the most difficult thing, which was to match that initial goal and at the time we were changing the structure of the team,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\n\u201cThen Messi\u2019s free-kick is a masterpiece. Barcelona wanted to rebel. They had not played for a long time and everything went straight.\n\n\u201cThe result is bulky, but we have to assimilate it, raise our heads and relativise it.\u201d", "description": "Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde said he had \u201crun out of words\u201d to describe Lionel Messi after his stellar display in a 5-1 win against Real Valladolid.
