But now it\u2019s been shelved,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe pound rallied to close to $1.30 from $1.22\u2026 We can say it is holding firm, which shows hopes (for avoiding no-deal Brexit) have not been dashed.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Substantial progress\u2019 \u2013\n\nRodrigo Catril, a senior forex strategist at National Australia Bank said the market was not in \u201cwait-and-see mode\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe saw the pound lose a little bit of ground, but from the perspective of what it\u2019s gained over the past week, that\u2019s really minimal,\u201d he told AFP.\n\nCatril said it appeared a deal would be done before October 31 but a great deal of uncertainty remained, including the possibility of a \u201cconfirmatory vote\u201d, or second Brexit referendum.\n\nAsian equity markets were a mixed bag after China\u2019s top trade negotiator Liu He said at the weekend that Beijing and Washington had made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d towards wrapping up a partial trade deal announced earlier this month.\n\nThe deal offered China a temporary reprieve from tariffs planned for mid-October, while Beijing said it would hike purchases of US agricultural goods.\n\nBut it did not roll back any of the duties already imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars in exports to the US, nor address another round of levies due in December.\n\nStill, the upbeat comments provided a boost to the yuan, which rose 0.2 percent against the dollar.\n\nAnd Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services, told Bloomberg TV: \u201cIt would be significant if they can get a phase one deal signed before Thanksgiving \u2014 the probability of that is probably a little bit over 60 percent right now.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important issue, and I think it could remove a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nIn early trade, Hong Kong was up 0.2 percent and Tokyo went into the break 0.3 percent higher with Singapore, Seoul and Wellington also up.\n\nBut Shanghai dipped 0.4 percent and Sydney shed 0.1 percent, while Taipei and Manila were also in the red.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 0230 GMT \u2013\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2911 from $1.2989 at 2100 GMT on Friday\n\nEuro/pound: UP at 86.41 pence from 86.20 pence\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1156 from $1.1174\n\nDollar/yen: UP at 108.47 yen from 108.35 yen\n\nTokyo \u2013 Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 22,555.34 (break)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Hang Seng: UP 0.2 percent at 26,764.86\n\nShanghai \u2013 Composite: DOWN 0.4 percent at 2,927.76\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: DOWN 17 cents at $53.61 per barrel\n\nBrent North Sea crude: DOWN 26 cents at $59.16 per barrel\n\nNew York \u2013 Dow: DOWN 1.0 percent at 26,770.20 (close)\n\nLondon \u2013 FTSE 100: DOWN 0.4 percent at 7,150.57 (close)", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Sterling fell on Monday after MPs voted to delay passing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, though losses", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/bd4076_prime-minister-boris-johnson-try-push-his-new-brexit-deal-parliament-week-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
