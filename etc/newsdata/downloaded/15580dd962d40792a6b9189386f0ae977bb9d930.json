Canadian authorities said in September a youth had been hospitalized, but so far no other countries have reported anything similar.\n\nPublic and political opinion appears to be hardening, however, with the administration of US President Donald Trump announcing in September it would ban in the coming months flavored e-cigarette products which are particularly attractive to young people.\n\nIndia has issued an outright ban on all e-cigarette products, as has the US state of Massachusetts.", "description": "Eighteen people have died from illnesses associated with e-cigarette use since March, US health authorities said Thursday, while more than a thousand others have suffered probable lung injuries linked to vaping.
