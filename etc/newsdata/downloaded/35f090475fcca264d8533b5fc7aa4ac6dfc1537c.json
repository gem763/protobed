That pullback creates an \u201cattractive entry point\u201d according to Mahaney, who raised his price target to $155 from $107. The new target implies 28% upside from current levels, taking into account Roku\u2019s 3.5% rise in Friday morning trading.\n\nOpinion: Netflix stock has fallen 30% in 3 months but its valuation is still irrational\n\nMahaney said Roku scores well in his \u201ccrucial combo\u201d of revenue growth plus earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) margin, which he deems a useful way to evaluate small-capitalization internet companies. Though the company\u2019s Ebitda margin is projected to be slightly negative for the third quarter, Mahaney expects 46% revenue growth for the period, which would amount to a strong \u201ccrucial combo\u201d score relative to peers.\n\nMahaney is also drawn to the company\u2019s positioning in the attractive streaming landscape, with a big opportunity to eat into TV ad dollars and benefit from the launches of new streaming services. As the market for streaming offerings becomes more fragmented, Roku should be able to lessen its reliance on YouTube, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN, +0.68% Prime Video, and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.87% He also sees potential for the company as it expands internationally and grows its Roku Channel, a curated hub for ad-supported content.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Why Roku thinks Apple and Disney will give the streaming platform a big boost\n\nRBC\u2019s move to the bull camp isn\u2019t particularly unusual. Of the 17 analysts tracked by FactSet who cover Roku\u2019s stock, 12 have buy ratings, three have hold ratings, and two rate the stock at sell. The average price target on FactSet is $134.94, dragged down by bearish targets as low as $60.\n\nRoku shares have fallen 19% over the past month, as the S&P 500 SPX, +1.09% has dropped 0.6%.", "description": "Roku Inc.\u2019s stock has surged 300% so far this year, but RBC Capital Markets now argues that the shares have more room to run.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HB120_Roku_ZG_20190102094209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
