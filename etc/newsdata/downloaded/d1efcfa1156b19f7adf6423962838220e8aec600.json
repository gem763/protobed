Netanyahu's failure to clinch victory in a ballot in April led to last week's election.\n\nRivlin, in his remarks, pointedly noted that he is under no obligation to grant his prime minister-designate that two-week extension to establish a governing coalition.\n\nNor did he commit to turning to Gantz if Netanyahu failed to break the current deadlock. Under law, Rivlin can assign the coalition-building task to any member of parliament he deems likely to succeed, or he can ask the legislature to pick someone.\n\nWith final results announced on Wednesday, Likud has the pledged support of 55 legislators in the 120-member parliament, against 54 for Blue and White. The two parties failed to reach a coalition deal in talks launched on Tuesday.\n\nFormer Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, a possible kingmaker, has been keeping his far-right Yisrael Beitenu party on the fence since the Sept. 17 ballot, citing differences with Likud's ultra-Orthodox religious partners and Blue and White's left-wing allies.\n\n\"It became clear that neither Netanyahu nor Gantz had the 61 seats necessary to form a government,\" Rivlin said at the ceremony.\n\n\"Netanyahu's ability to assemble an administration is higher at the moment,\" the president said, noting that 10 Arab legislators in Gantz's support bloc of 54, who recommended he nominate the ex-general, did not commit to joining a government.\n\nRivlin had until next Wednesday to announce his choice, but the Likud-Blue and White unity talks showed no sign of progress.\n\nA deal in which Netanyahu and Gantz would take turns as prime minister was widely mooted.\n\nBut in his campaign, Gantz pledged not serve in a government with Netanyahu, citing the Israeli leader's legal troubles. And Gantz's deputies in Blue and White also voiced their strong opposition while the unity talks were under way.\n\nNext month, Israel\u2019s attorney-general will hold a pre-trial hearing on his announced intention to indict the Israeli leader on fraud and bribery charges in three corruption cases. Netanyahu, who says he is a victim of a political witch-hunt, can argue at the session against being charged.\n\nAs prime minister, Netanyahu would be under no legal obligation to resign if formal charges were filed. But any other cabinet post might not offer him that protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Alex Richardson)", "description": "Israel's president tasked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday with assembling a new government after power-sharing talks with his strongest rival, Benny Gantz, failed following an inconclusive election.
