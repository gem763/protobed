(NOAA Climate Prediction Center)\n\nFollowing one of the hottest summers on record, the fall looks to be exceptionally toasty, as well. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s fall outlook calls for above-average temperatures across the entire Lower 48 and Alaska.\n\nThe areas with the highest likelihood of warmer-than-average conditions this fall include the North Slope of Alaska, the Four Corners region and New England. Ordinarily, sea ice would chill Alaska\u2019s North Slope. But not this year.\n\n\u201cThe overall retreat in the Beaufort Sea is about as extreme as our analyses have shown in the last 20 years,\u201d wrote the National Weather Service in Anchorage. Utqia\u0121vik \u2014 Alaska\u2019s northernmost town \u2014 spent an astonishing 85 days above freezing, from June 25 to Thursday.\n\n\u201cPrior to the 1990s it wasn\u2019t uncommon for the longest above freezing streak to be [less than] 10 days,\u201d tweeted Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the International Arctic Research Center. Satellite-derived Arctic sea ice extent this season reached its second lowest on record, behind only 2012.\n\nThis fall should prove no different.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that this red-plastered map comes on the heels of an exceptionally warm summer, during which not a single state ranked below average.\n\nJuly was the planet\u2019s warmest month on record, while the summer overall ranked as the hottest on record for the Northern Hemisphere. The past five years have marked the warmest period on record, as well.\n\nDespite this, much of the United States hasn\u2019t been as toasty as it might be, thanks to a stubborn dip in the jet stream over the Plains and northern tier.\n\nSummer in the contiguous United States was the coolest in five years, but cool is relative \u2014 it was still anomalously hot, compared with long-term baselines, and summer ranked in the top third of such seasons historically, NOAA found. The Central United States cool-down prevented us from ending up higher on the leader board. But a number of other locations logged mind-boggling heat.\n\nTake Alaska, for instance. Anchorage recorded eight 80-degree days this year. The previous record is four times in a season. The overnight low failed to drop below 60 degrees nine times. That\u2019s as many times in three months as occurred between 1950 and 1990. This summer was 12 percent more humid in Alaska\u2019s largest city than during any other summer on record.\n\nHawaii is in the same boat because of anomalously high sea-surface temperatures surrounding the islands. Honolulu saw its warmest summer on record. So did Kahului and Lihue, two of Hawaii\u2019s other three long-running climate stations. The only Aloha State station to miss the mark was in Hilo, where 2019 came in second place behind 2015. Four of the five warmest summers on record there have occurred in the past five years.\n\n2019 has been a ridiculous year for record heat in in Hawaii. Honolulu's (129-year period of record) set 45 daily record highs this year so far and Lihue (114-year period of record) has set records in 27 of the last 32 days including a streak of 20 straight! pic.twitter.com/o8FjhGB9Io \u2014 Maxar | Weather Desk (@Maxar_Weather) September 20, 2019\n\nLihue, on the island of Kauai, broke or tied its record-high temperature 20 days in a row! Bob Henson, a meteorologist at Weather Underground, described the remarkable feat as \u201clikely unprecedented.\u201d Twenty-seven of the past 32 days have featured record-tying or -breaking temperatures for the station, at which records date back to 1905. That means if you were to select a random day during the past two months, there\u2019s a roughly 2 in 3 chance of it being a record-setter.\n\nLihue also has seen 41 record-high minimum temperatures since the beginning of July. For comparison, Lihue has measured exactly zero record lows during 2019.\n\nHawaii\u2019s not the only tropical paradise baking. Miami is feeling the heat, too. Temperatures didn\u2019t drop below 80 degrees for nine days in a row, ending Sept. 11. The city also saw a four-day stretch of temperatures topping 95 degrees back in June. Miami has hit 90 or greater every day this month except Thursday. Brian McNoldy, Capital Weather Gang\u2019s tropical weather expert, pointed out that it\u2019s been the warmest front half of September on record in Miami.\n\nJust about everybody\u2019s been hot outside that trough that chilled the nation\u2019s heartland. Even New England saw an exceptionally hot summer. July was the warmest month on record in Boston, Portland, Hartford and Manchester. Sure, there\u2019s been cold in some spots. But there\u2019s been a heck of a lot more warmth.\n\n[July was the warmest month on record in Boston, Portland, Hartford and Manchester]\n\nAnd it looks as if that trend is set to continue. The majority of weather models depict a warmer-than-average pattern as we head into winter. A chunk of average or slightly below average temperatures may become briefly nestled over New England, but otherwise, warmth is favored virtually everywhere.\n\nFor those complaining about the toasty fall, be careful what you say.
