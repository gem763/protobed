The move comes in the aftermath of a 55-8 loss in Vancouver against the B.C. Lions on Saturday.\n\nArgos president Bill Manning enlisted Clemons' help last month in an advisory role as the losses piled up for the club.\n\nClemons inherits a team that doesn't have one of its top three quarterbacks under contract for next season \u2014 McLeod Bethel-Thompson, James Franklin and Zach Collaros. The Argos hired Corey Chamblin as head coach on a multi-year contract prior to this season.\n\nPopp was hired in 2017 and the Argos won the Grey Cup that year with veteran quarterback Ricky Ray.\n\nThe Toronto Argonauts fired general manager Jim Popp on Tuesday. Despite guiding the Argos to the Grey Cup title in 2017 the team finished 4-14 last year and is a CFL-worst 2-12 this year. (THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nBut since Ray went down with a career-ending injury in the season opener the following season, the team hasn't found any consistency at the quarterback position.\n\nClemons became interim coach of the Argos in the middle of the 2000 season as his playing career ended.\n\nThe 54-year-old native of Dunedin, Fla., stayed as coach in 2001 before moving up to team president.\n\nBut when the team fired Gary Etcheverry in 2002, Clemons returned to his head coaching role. He guided the team to a Grey Cup title in 2004 and finished no worse than second in the East Division from 2002 to 2007 before stepping down to become chief executive officer.\n\nThe five-foot-six native of Dunedin, Fla., was a star running back/returner with the Argos from 1989 to 2000. He was named the CFL's most outstanding player in 1990 and helped the Argos win back-to-back Grey Cups in 1996 and '97.\n\nJohn Murphy, the Argos' director of player personnel, will stay with the club and now has the title of vice president of player personnel. He figures to be Clemons' right-hand man in the front office.\n\nAlong with being the worst team in the standings, Toronto also is last in the CFL in attendance, including a crowd of under 10,000 for a game last month at BMO Field.\n\nThe move to BMO Field from the Rogers Centre in 2016 has done nothing to stop a downward slide in attendance.\n\nNeither has an ownership change to Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which has been in control of the club the past two years. MLSE also owns the Maple Leafs, Raptors, Toronto FC and other sports and entertainment properties.", "description": "The Toronto Argonauts have fired general manager Jim Popp and replaced him with Mike (Pinball) Clemons, a former star player, head coach and executive with the club.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313213.1570546312!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/clemons-pinball-062216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
