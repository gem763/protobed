The party he had attended took place seven years ago but the picture only came to light last year when a picture of the president appeared on Facebook. The photo was then swiftly deleted, the source claimed.\n\nThey added that the label president had since been shunned by some music industry colleagues, including rapper Stormzy who banned him from standing near the stage during his Glastonbury performance.\n\nMr Cook was at Atlantic for 12 years, first working at the label\u2019s sister company Asylum Records, where he discovered Sheeran and, along with colleague Ed Howard, gave him his first record deal. Mr Cook became Atlantic\u2019s UK president in 2014.\n\nRun-DMC were Jammaster Jay (Jason Mizell), Run (Joseph Simons) and DMC (Darryl McDaniels)\n\nOver the years he has also worked closely with music stars including Clean Bandit, Rudimental and Anne-Marie.\n\nMr Cook also helped to bring Stormzy to the label last year as part of a joint venture with the rapper\u2019s own Merky Records outfit. In a statement Cook said he was previously reprimanded by the label for dressing as a member of the American hip-hop group, but that new allegations about his appearance prompted his departure.\n\n\u2018It is with great sadness that today I announce I am stepping down as president of Atlantic Records UK\u2019, he said.\n\n\u2018Seven years ago, at a birthday party where guests were asked to come dressed as their favourite musical icon, I came as a member of Run-DMC. Late last year rumours began to circulate about my appearance at that event, many of which are simply untrue.\n\nMr Cook was at Atlantic for 12 years, first working at the label\u2019s sister company Asylum Records, where he discovered Ed Sheeran\n\n\u2018While my intention was to honour a musical hero, I recognise my appearance was offensive and I made a terrible mistake.\u2019\n\nMr Cook also helped to bring Stormzy (pictured at TRNSMT) to the label last year as part of a joint venture with the rapper\u2019s own Merky Records outfit\n\nMr Cook went on to explain that he \u2018readily agreed\u2019 to disciplinary actions from Atlantic Records, but that allegations about the party had continued. \u2018I am devastated that this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, values which I have championed throughout my career\u2019, he said.\n\n\u2018I unreservedly apologise to anyone who has been hurt.\u2019\n\nA statement from Warner Music, the parent company of Atlantic, said: \u2018Ben Cook is leaving Atlantic UK and this will be his last week in the office.\u2019\n\nThe controversy comes weeks after Canadian premier Justin Trudeau was heavily criticised for wearing black face paint at several parties as a younger man.\n\nMr Cook was defended by grime MC Wiley, who worked with him on the 2008 hit Wearing My Rolex and tweeted: 'Ben Cook is not racist. Give that man back his job.'", "description": "Atlantic Records UK president Ben Cook said the fancy dress idea was a 'terrible mistake'.
