They say that a reduced police presence inside the casino is allowing suspected criminals to launder money with impunity. 'You can\u2019t do you job properly. They prefer you to go out and do liquor inspections which take next to nothing than do a proper decent investigation because it\u2019s too time consuming', one whistleblower said. The footage was leaked to independent MP Andrew Wilkie who has been calling for a royal commission into the casino industry", "description": "CCTV from Melbourne's Crown casino shows men casually handing over shopping bags filled with wads of cash", "authors": ["Source", "Youtube Andrew Wilkie"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cc0d346f047b141e97749f9d8eae915ea4966d/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d7ecc1344265e9162e8e9db1975e1427", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
