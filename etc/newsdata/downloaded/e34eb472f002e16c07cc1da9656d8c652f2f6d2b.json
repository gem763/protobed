To that end, investors hear a lot about the minimum number of mutual funds and ETFs they need to get that diversification.\n\nBut is there a maximum amount of funds an investor should hold?\n\nYes, according to financial experts. At some point, adding funds becomes counterproductive. For some advisers, the number is as low as 10; for others, it\u2019s closer to 20.\n\n\u201cOnce you get into the 20s, you\u2019re getting marginal benefits from a diversification standpoint,\u201d says Josh Charlson, a director of manager selection at research firm Morningstar in Chicago.\n\nIndeed, you can become so diversified that you simply mimic a big index, while paying lofty fees. It is also more difficult to track and rebalance a portfolio with many funds. And if you have a lot of mutual funds in a nonretirement account, you may face substantial taxes.\n\nIn building a portfolio, investors should first think about how to allocate their assets rather than how many funds to own, experts say. \u201cIf you start with that question, it\u2019s easier to get to the right number of funds,\u201d Mr. Charlson says.\n\nFor instance, some investors may own six U.S.-stock funds, with a focus on large-cap growth, large-cap value, midcap growth, midcap value, small-cap growth and small-cap value. But if they own more than those six, there is a good chance they will come close to replicating one of the major market indexes. They may also have funds with overlapping holdings. Instead, they could just buy a passive mutual fund or ETF based on the index.\n\nIf investors build a portfolio with actively managed funds, they will pay more in fees than if they use passive funds. If they\u2019re using ETFs and trade actively, their trading commissions also may start to add up. The average expense ratio for active U.S. open-end mutual funds is 1.11% a year, and it\u2019s 0.51% for passive ETFs, according to Morningstar.\n\n\u201cYou should try to cover much of the market, but try to do it efficiently, without duplication,\u201d says Tom Fredrickson, a financial adviser in New York who\u2019s part of the Garrett Planning Network. \u201cI would think longer about adding a fund than subtracting one,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to make sure it\u2019s really adding diversification.\u201d\n\nHard to follow\n\nThe more funds investors own, the more they have to follow, which can be a burden, especially with actively managed funds. Of course, investors will want to monitor their funds\u2019 performance. They will also want to know if the managers of a fund change or if its strategy changes. And they will want to regularly look at their funds\u2019 holdings.\n\n\u201c[All] that\u2019s hard to track,\u201d says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. In addition, investors will likely receive a good deal of written material from their funds. \u201cYou could be inundated with a lot of pieces of mail or email,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless you\u2019re looking for kindling to start a wood stove, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nAn excess of funds makes it difficult to analyze what is owned and to make sure the asset-allocation weightings are correct. Figuring out how the sale of a fund would affect a portfolio becomes tricky. A bloated fund roster also adds complexity to periodic rebalancing of a portfolio to keep weightings in line.\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re rebalancing just once a year, that\u2019s a lot of work,\u201d Mr. Charlson says. \u201cYou probably won\u2019t be inclined to do it as often, and your allocation gets out of whack.\u201d\n\nTax costs also are harder to track in a nonretirement portfolio stuffed with funds. Investors don\u2019t have to pay taxes on income in a retirement fund. But rebalancing a portfolio in a nonretirement account can generate a capital-gains tax liability for the funds that you sell.\n\nExperts say all of these complications necessitate the use of a computerized tracking tool to aggregate and analyze a portfolio that\u2019s stuffed to the gills.\n\nBurden for your spouse\n\nMultiple-fund portfolios generate another issue for older investors.\n\n\u201cIf you die, your spouse is left with a huge welter of funds to deal with,\u201d Mr. Fredrickson says. And that may be beyond the spouse\u2019s comfort level, leading either to mistakes in their management of the funds or to high costs from hiring an adviser to manage the portfolio.\n\nInvestors will want more funds if they predominantly have actively managed funds, because there is a much greater chance that one of them will blow up than there is of a passive fund blowing up, Mr. Fredrickson says. He generally focuses on passive funds in client portfolios, with a maximum of 12, but says when a client prefers actively managed funds, a case can be made for up to 20 in a portfolio.\n\nSometimes investors\u2019 fund count can rise unintentionally as they randomly purchase funds that look appealing over time. It even happens to professional investors. Mr. Ablin, for example, manages money for his 22- and 26-year-old daughters. As their savings came into the accounts, \u201cI would buy interesting funds,\u201d he says. That included a Mexican stock fund and currency funds.\n\nThe buying brought him up to 16 funds per daughter. Several weeks ago, he sold all the accounts\u2019 losers to offset capital gains. He\u2019s now down to eight funds for each daughter and sees that as an approximate maximum. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to buy shiny new funds,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that may undermine your mission.\u201d\n\nTo avoid adding extraneous funds, Mr. Charlson says, the question to ask when considering a new one is, \u201cWhat are the allocations I need, and does the manager fit this well?\u201d\n\nMr. Weil is a writer in West Palm Beach, Fla.
