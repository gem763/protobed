That's more than the federal minimum wage of $7.25.\n\nThe program was initially supposed to last only six months, but Mayor Frank Scott Jr. said last month he would push to extend it through the end of September 2020.\n\nThe City of Little Rock spent $80,000 on the program's first six months, 12 News Now reports. The program has been run by Canvas Community Church.\n\n\"We\u2019re super excited about what has gone on, and we hope to be able to keep the momentum going,\u201d pastor Paul Atkins said, according to 12 News Now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who participate in the program also receive mental and physical health services, help with job interviews and temporary housing. The goal isn\u2019t necessarily spotless streets; it\u2019s an opportunity for people to turn their fortunes around.\n\n\u201cWe want to work with them on their next step,\" Atkins told the city's board of directors last month. \"There are a lot of barriers that our people experience to go from homelessness and panhandling to full-time work.
