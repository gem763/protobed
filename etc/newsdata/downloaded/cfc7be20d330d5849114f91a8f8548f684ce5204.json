The final UK paper opens discussions on its scope.\n\nExplaining to the EU27 the failure to provide copies of the papers to the member states\u2019 representatives, the commission\u2019s Brexit taskforce wrote in an email: \u201cThe UK labelled the documents as HMG property and requested us not to do any onward disclosure \u2026 We intend to discuss working methods with the UK in terms of transparency and sharing information.\u201d\n\nThe foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has previously claimed that the government has been loth to share written proposals with the EU in case they are leaked and trashed in public.\n\nEU diplomats complain that it will be impossible for the negotiations to progress if the member states are unable to thoroughly analyse British plans for replacing the Irish backstop.\n\nDowning Street is refusing to commit to tabling any concrete solutions for replacing the backstop before a two-week deadline suggested by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Finland, Antti Rinne, to allow time for negotiations to bear fruit before a crunch summit on 17 October.\n\nA Downing Street spokesman described the deadline as \u201cartificial\u201d. \u201cWe will table formal written solutions when we are ready,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said the gap between the two negotiating positions was wide.\n\nHe said: \u201cAsking to remove a very significant section from the withdrawal agreement that solves many of the Irish issues without any serious proposals on how you solve these problems is not going to be the basis of an agreement.\u201d\n\nThe Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is visiting Brussels on Friday. His trip coincides with the end of the 30-day \u201cblistering timetable\u201d to break the Brexit deadlock declared by Johnson when he met the German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. Merkel had said the two sides could \u201cmaybe find [a Brexit solution] in the next 30 days\u201d, although she later clarified she had not set a formal deadline, but was pointing to the urgency of the situation.\n\nBrussels insiders have always said there was never a 30-day deadline. \u201cThere\u2019s only one real deadline and that\u2019s 31 October,\u201d one EU diplomat told the Guardian. \u201cMore worrying is that the last 30 days haven\u2019t been put to any good use, [and neither] were the last couple of months. It doesn\u2019t bode well about the intentions of this government for the last 30-odd days [of remaining talks]. Is the UK really happy to leave Europe without a deal?\u201d", "description": "Downing Street tells Brussels negotiators documents must not be shared with 27 states", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a724211f10053303bab9a747ddc595e00c238cce/351_100_1371_822/master/1371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=259012653433ec291f88172f7a5c75f9", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
