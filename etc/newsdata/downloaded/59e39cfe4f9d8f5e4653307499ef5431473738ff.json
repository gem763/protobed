(Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nWe hate to be the bearers of bad news, but it turns out that cheating is fairly common among couples.\n\nA recent study has revealed that more than half of women and men have cheated on their significant other. Not only that, but many of them apparently feel happier in their relationships after having cheated.\n\nDon\u2019t go digging for clues of cheating just yet \u2013 the findings were released by Illicit Encounters, an extra-martial site, meaning that most of the people polled are likely already having an affair or looking to do so.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s no secret that cheating happens. So, to find out more about why people are unfaithful, we asked six women and men to share their tales with us \u2013 here\u2019s what they said.\n\nRuby, 49\n\n\u2018I had an affair with a married work colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When you wear a uniform and work nights dealing with traumatic incidents, you tend to get closer to colleagues than you might normally do.\n\n\u2018We started dating (because it wasn\u2019t just a sex thing) and within a month or two it developed from walks and beautiful sunsets into nights away and adventurous sex.\n\n\u2018He moved in with me, but because of his two young children he went back to his wife after a month or so. I was totally heartbroken.\n\n\u2018I also once met his wife, who told me that he would come back to me because he loved me, not her \u2013 but he didn\u2019t. Their marriage lasted a few more years and then he left her for someone else.\n\n\u2018About 15 years later, we met up again on a sex site and rekindled that sexual flame, it was great fun. He was still married.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s now been a year since we had sex and I honestly don\u2019t think I would go back again. My husband had an affair with a colleague, so I see that as a little bit of rough justice and karma biting me on the bum!\u2019\n\nLaura*, 37\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been having an issue with a guy who lied to me about his marriage having ended. \u2018We initially got together after a few drinks at an industry event and after that chatted via messaging apps every day. He told me that he wanted to take me on dates and such, but it never transpired. \u2018We got together again at another industry event and a day or so after I got an anonymous message telling me to check his wife\u2019s Facebook, as she has a photo of them together on it. On holiday. The holiday he went on with his \u2018mum\u2019 while we were chatting. \u2018It\u2019s taken me months to finally let it all out to him with regards to his lies, but I finally told him this week (due to fear about work-related stuff, our community is very close and chatty) that I was fed up with his lies as it was causing me mental damage. No apology from him yet. And I doubt there will be one. \u2018He should be glad I\u2019m not the type who would approach his wife.\u2019\n\nJules, 37\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t love my husband, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s true.\n\n\u2018I married him because he is a good father and provider, I never felt real love for him. We start off with the best intentions, but marriage isn\u2019t what you expect. I don\u2019t like the word affair, it\u2019s a Victorian term, it\u2019s more friendship than affair.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had it all, a three-year romance and one-night-stands.\u2019\n\nEdward*, 29\n\n\u2018This girl started working at my office and I thought she was super hot.\n\n\u2018One night, I asked her to hang out and we ended up at a club where her boyfriend works.\n\n\u2018We got trashed on free drinks that her boyfriend (the barman) gave us and afterwards, we got a cab back to hers \u2013 he stayed at work \u2013 and I smoothly vomited all over her carpet.\n\n\u2018After that ordeal, I still ended up handcuffed to her bed post. She returned into the room after \u2018getting ready\u2019, sporting a latex nurse outfit and a whip.\n\n\u2018I felt bad for her boyfriend, but I was very young at the time and not as bothered as I would have been now. I\u2019m not sure if she ever told him about it.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t have sex again, but she did suck me off once.\u2019\n\nPatty*, 25\n\n\u2018Two years ago, I met up with my French exchange in Paris.\n\n\u2018We used to have a romantic relationship when we were teenagers.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s married now, and spent the whole time talking about how he loves to cheat on his wife. He said he married her so she could stay in the country (I think she\u2019s Russian).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was shocked by his openness but spent the entire evening flirting with him. I had zero intention to do anything with him, but there was so much sexual chemistry.\n\n\u2018After plenty of red wine, I suggested we head off. As he walked me to the train station, he grabbed my hands and we kissed \u2013 it was pretty f***ing hot, but it felt very wrong in my gut.\n\n\u2018I spent the next day crying about it and he kept messaging, telling me we should meet at his place during his lunch break.\n\n\u2018We met up for lunch instead, and I told him how unhappy I was with what we did. He got defensive and said \u201cif you wanna call my wife, go for it\u201d and put his phone next to me. He then told me how much he loves lying, how he doesn\u2019t dream, and how he likes to f*** his wife\u2019s friends.\n\n\u2018After lunch we said our goodbyes and messaged a bit but I have now totally cut him from my life.\u2019\n\nSamantha, 47 \u2018I\u2019m having an affair because my marriage lacks intimacy \u2013 we are more like best friends. \u2018I\u2019m currently dating a man outside of my marriage that I met on a cheating site. It\u2019s very casual and he is also married. \u2018I\u2019ve loved every second of having sex outside of my marriage, I don\u2019t know how to say no to temptation; and I don\u2019t feel guilty. I recommend having an affair. It gives you so much confidence. \u2018But if I went back in time, I would still marry my husband.\u2019\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: What is \u2018sex brain\u2019?\n\nMORE: How to have feminist sex\n\nMORE: There\u2019s now a special spongy tool to soak up semen after sex\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "From sleeping with people who have a partner to finding out your significant other is married, this is what having an affair is really like.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/midweek-orgy-c592_1570448256.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
