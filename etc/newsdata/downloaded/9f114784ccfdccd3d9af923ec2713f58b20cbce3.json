Any reports to the contrary are 100% fiction.\u201d\n\nWHY RENEE ZELLWEGER DIDN'T MEET JUSY GARLANDS'S CHILDREN TO RESEARCH ROLE IN UPCOMING BIOPIC\n\nZellweger, 50, recently spoke to Fox News about how she was able to embody the troubled actress and singer.\n\n\"I approached it really humbly with curiosity and lifelong admiration \u2013 awe, really,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I just wanted to learn as much as I could and read between the lines because I think that a lot of what we sort of address in the film has gone unaddressed or not.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cJerry McGuire\u201d actress continued: \u201cIt's just what isn't in the [contemporary] article that was written about her. What'd they leave out? What are the extenuating circumstances that nobody wants to talk about? What's happening in the private moments?\n\n\"And so I just \u2013 I sat with all of the facts and all of the sort of linear history of this period in her life, and I tried to understand from my own personal experiences and everything else that I read and what was missing in the telling of this part of the story of this part of her life.\n\n\u201cBut again, just I wanted to be careful because I, like generations of people, I have loved her a lifetime. And so it's just a special experience it was thought to be able to live in that exploration for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite Minnelli\u2019s condemnation of the project, Goold hopes the actress will still go out and see the film.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a friend, he\u2019s a dancer and backing singer who had worked with Liza, and he said, \u2018The thing about Liza is she\u2019s incredibly passionate and emotional but also will really change her view,'\u201d Goold told ET. \u201cNot that Liza has been hostile to the movie, particularly, but I have every faith that she\u2019ll see it and find it celebratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d is set to open in movie theaters on Friday, Sept. 27.", "description": "Rupert Goold said he understands why Liza Minnelli is so critical of his upcoming biopic about her mother, Judy Garland.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/People-Liza-Minnelli_Admi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
