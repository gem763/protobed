Adam Schiff, Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler as the witches and President Donald Trump as the hero.\n\n\u201cCongressional Democrats continue their bogus Witch Hunt of President Trump because they still can\u2019t accept the results of the 2016 election,\u201d said Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News. \u201cThe President will continue delivering for the American people as he promised them in 2016, and there is no stopping him. The American people stand with their President and we will Keep America Great!\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign launched its Halloween themed attack as House Democrats continue to pursue their case to impeach the president.\n\nPelosi moved forward on the impeachment process but has so far refused to hold a House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry for fear of political risk for centrist House Democrats.\n\nNadler, despite describing the impeachment effort against former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s as a lynch mob, has pushed for impeaching the president since winning the House majority in the 2018 midterms.\n\nSchiff has conducted his impeachment hearing entirely in a secret room in the basement of Capitol Hill, leaking select details bolstering the case for impeachment to the establishment media.\n\nThe president on Monday described Schiff as the \u201cbiggest leaker in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Adam Schiff is the biggest leaker in Washington,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou know that. I know that. We all know that. I\u2019ve watched Adam Schiff leak. He\u2019s a corrupt politician. He\u2019s a leaker like nobody has ever seen before.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump's presidential campaign launched new merchandise mocking the Democrat \"witch hunt\" on Monday.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/image001.jpg@01D58D7A.089A3CB0-640x335.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
