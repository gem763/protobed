The incidents were reportedly sparked by McCain taking exception to heckles from a 13-year-old Bills fan, and resulted in McCain threatening to spit in the boy\u2019s face, then actually spitting in another fan\u2019s face after the game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI talked to Bobby about this this morning and he and I had a pretty open dialogue,\u201d Flores said. \u201cHeard his side of the story. It\u2019s unfortunate, I feel he needed to handle that situation better. We\u2019re going to discipline Bobby for that. We\u2019ll handle that discipline internally.\u201d\n\nA fifth-round pick in the 2015 NFL draft, McCain signed a four-year, $27 million contract with the team before the 2018 offseason. He has previously gotten into hot water, punching future teammate Danny Amendola during a game in 2017.\n\nBobby McCain did not react well to heckles from a 13-year-old.

The 26-year-old McCain reportedly responded by turning around and threatening to spit in the boy\u2019s face, according to a fan named Dylan Wentland.\n\nStory continues\n\nWentland reportedly confronted McCain over the behavior, which resulted in him getting a surprise after the game.\n\nFrom the Buffalo News:\n\n\"He's the nicest kid in the world. He's sat behind us for years with his dad. He was just having a good time,\" said Wentland, a 15-year season ticket holder. \"I go, 'Dude, what\u2019s wrong with you? What kind of role model are you for the kid?'\" Wentland said he didn't interact with McCain anymore during the game, but when the game ended and players left the field, McCain sought him out. \"I haven\u2019t even said a word to him. He runs right up to me and spits in my face and then runs down the tunnel,\" Wentland said. \"I mean literally wound up, hocked and just spit right in my face while I\u2019m standing there.\"\n\nSheriff\u2019s deputies reportedly responded to the first incident by trying to escort Wentland away, but other fans backed him up. The boy\u2019s father, Scott Hammond, backed Wentland\u2019s account of the incident to the News:\n\n\"McCain walked over and, like, faked spitting on him five or six times,\" Hammond said, referring to McCain's actions toward his son before the game. \"He made the noise but nothing came out.\u201d Hammond said McCain threatened to spit on the boy again while headed back through the tunnel after warmups, but another player kept McCain moving.\n\nMultiple fans reportedly gave statements about the incident to deputies, resulting in undersheriff Mark Wipperman telling the News the allegation is \u201cserious\u201d and \u201cgross.\u201d\n\nObviously, that\u2019s a new, particularly odd low for the Dolphins this year. The team is unapologetically tanking this season for a shot at the No. 1 overall pick in the quarterback-rich 2020 NFL draft, but that end result doesn\u2019t mean much for the players left on the roster who aren\u2019t valuable enough to leave via trade.\n\nThe team is last in the NFL in points for and points allowed. It\u2019s in the league\u2019s bottom three in passing offense, rushing offense and rushing defense. It ranks 22nd in passing defense, and last in turnover margin. But hey, at least the team is No. 1 in spit attempts this season.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Dolphins' starting safety reportedly threatened to spit on the boy after he called the team \"irrelevant.\"", "authors": ["Jack Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Iv8W72jpzDsgKPmFqRtJMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LQsJUWdX1_epO5UjpBGFiw--~B/aD0zOTg0O3c9NTk3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/50265470-f449-11e9-bdeb-c67007153452", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
