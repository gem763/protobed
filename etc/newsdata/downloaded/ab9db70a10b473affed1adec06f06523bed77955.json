Titled Life Labyrinth, it also offered a place to sit, or wander.\n\n'Life Labyrinth' by Patternity outside Westminster Cathedral. @studiostagg\n\nAt the new Coal Drop Yards retail complex in Kings Cross, Italian designer Martino Gamper installed Disco Carbonara \u2013 a giant patchwork facade that conceals a tiny chipboard dance floor; fronted by a man behind a velvet rope. (Crowds were queuing to get in.)\n\nNear Hyde Park, a 13-metre-high tower called Paddington Pyramid was composed of vibrant panels of fabric that fluttered in the wind. The work of provocative designer Adam Nathaniel Furman, festival organisers called it \u201ca moment of fun and fanfare in the everyday fabric of our city\u201d.\n\nMartino Gamper's 'Disco Carbonara' was a patchwork facade leading to a tiny dance floor in Kings Cross.\n\nDespite the ambient noise of an imminent Brexit, the British capital was being fearlessly upbeat.\n\nThe director of the London Design Festival, Ben Evans compares Brexit to \u201cthe creative sacking of Rome\u201d. But the city\u2019s creative sector, he insists, \u201cis like a supertanker. The scale and momentum means that it will keep moving forward\u201d.\n\nInterior motives\n\nNow in its 17th year, the London Design Festival is the umbrella organisation of 11 districts scattered across the metropolis. And while showcasing the city\u2019s creative industries is clearly a priority, the endgame is to sell new product \u2013 of which there was plenty. Here\u2019s our pick of the best:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Pawson for WonderGlass\n\n\n\nJohn Pawson's 'Sleeve' pendants for WonderGlass.\n\nPawson is Britain\u2019s arch-minimalist architect, a man committed to rigour of vision and purity of line. For him, \u201ceverything is traceable back to a consistent set of preoccupations with mass, volume, surface, proportion, junction, geometry, repetition, light and ritual\u201d. His new designs for WonderGlass show the Venetian glass manufacturer at its most tempered. And yet, despite the severity of their lines, there\u2019s a quiet exuberance to Pawson\u2019s three new \u2018Sleeve\u2019 pendants. It\u2019s in the way one straight-sided, hand-blown transparent cylinder nestles neatly within another that is flared to create a gentle lip, the space between them allowing the light to emanate a gentle aura. Directional lighting is focused below.\n\nMax Lamb for Gallery FUMI\n\n\n\nMax Lamb used an ancient Japanese lacquering technique to finish the 'Urushi' chair. Courtesy Gallery FUMI\n\nLamb is the ultimate DIY guy, happiest when hewing into unwieldy boulders or trees. A few years back he became fascinated by the ancient Japanese technique of urushi lacquering, which uses the sap of the Toxicodendron vernicifluum, commonly known as the Chinese or Japanese lacquer tree. Once it dries, the lacquer is insoluble, making it perfect for tableware. Where the traditional-furniture making technique tends to sublimate the wood grain beneath layer upon layer of lacquer, Lamb convinced local craftsmen to cleave logs along the grain by axe and paling knife to respect their natural structure.\n\nJet black and deliciously textured, the resulting off-form stools, tables, shelving and chairs are the perfect marriage of modernity and craft.\n\nOn show at Gallery FUMI, 2 Hay Hill, Mayfair, until October 26\n\nLee Broom, Kaleidoscopia\n\nKaleidoscopia was an installation of multiple 'Orion' lights by Lee Broom.\n\nNo visit to London would be complete without popping into the East End gallery of Lee Broom. The maestro of contemporary lighting design, his headquarters brightens up the gritty streets of Hackney. For this edition of the London Design Fair, Broom created a light sculpture using multiples of his best-selling Orion pendant lights arrayed to create the effect of a carousel. Brilliant. Lee Broom\u2019s lighting is available from Space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLegacy by American Hardwood at the Victoria & Albert Museum\n\n\n\nTristram Hunt, director of the V&A commissioned Jasper Morrison to design unique furniture for his reception area, using American red oak supplied by AHEC. Ed Reeve\n\nThe chairman of the London Design Festival, Sir John Sorrell, invited leaders of select London institutions to commission 10 designers to create a piece expressly suited to their needs using American red oak supplied by the American Hardwood Export Council. As far as branding exercises go, it was nuanced in conception and painstaking in execution, with all the work carried out in the Berkshire workshops of British furniture manufacturer Benchmark, co-founded by Sir Terence Conran.\n\nThe industrial designer Terence Woodgate was paired with the chief executive of the Royal Opera House, Alex Beard, who commissioned him to create twinned sofas for the parlour where he meets incoming conductors and musicians. The artistic director of the English National Ballet, Tamara Rojo, got to order her dream bookcase from Martino Gamper.\n\nSerpentine Galleries artistic director Hans Ulrich Obrist asked Studiomama to devise new-look postboxes into which gallery visitors could slip their postcards. The resulting fluted ovoid columns are pale and inviting to the touch, designed to develop a patina over time and contact with at least some of the 1.2 million visitors to the Serpentine each year.\n\nDesigner lodgings\n\nCitizenM is a chain of design hotels established in The Netherlands just over a decade ago and now in New York, Taipei, Zurich, Paris and London. With a pledge to total consistency of style, each hotel is assembled on-site using prefabricated metal modules shipped in from Holland.\n\nThe ground-floor atrium of the citizenM in Shoreditch.\n\nThe rooms are compact but highly functional, each with a king-size bed taking up a third of the space beneath a picture window (Since all rooms, on all floors in every city are identical at least you know no one else is getting a better deal.)\n\nThe operators have an exclusive contract with Swiss design giant Vitra, so guests can rest assured that their Jacobsen, Eames, Prouv\u00e9 and Panton chairs are originals.\n\nThe Shoreditch hotel, one of three in London, has the luxury of a ground-floor atrium from which a timber staircase spirals up to the first floor, a gaggle of George Nelson Bubble lamps suspended overhead to set the mood. With new parquet floors and a lot of black fittings offset with touches of fire-engine red, the expansive \u201cLiving Room\u201d (canteen, bar and work zone) can feel a tad like a furniture showroom. But then, that\u2019s a setting I personally feel very comfortable with.\n\nPegged as affordable luxury accommodation, rooms are from $420 a night.\n\nThe writer stayed as a guest of citizenM.", "description": "From vibrant street furniture to functional sculpture and architectural follies, the city thumbed its nose at Brexit for one spectacular week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0605%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_215/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1bc162e3b1815f050c702abaa8cd319bb22f5d41", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
