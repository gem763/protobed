Niraj Antani, an Indian American Republican. \u201cWe are the most highly educated, highest-earning ethnic group in the country so when we are talking about pro growth-policies, Republican policies work for them.\u201d\n\nStill, more than 80 percent of Indian Americans voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016, according to polling by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n\nSome Indian Americans, whose families came to the United States legally to study or work, don\u2019t mind Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration since it\u2019s primarily about illegal immigration but others are turned off.\n\nTrump\u2019s job approval with Indian Americans was only 28 percent in 2018, according to the Asian American Voter Survey, a poll of registered Asian-American voters. About 66 percent of disapproved.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans believe Donald Trump's appearance with Prime Minister Modi will move our community towards the president, they're sadly mistaken,\u201d said North Carolina State Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, an Indian Ameican Democrat. \u201cIn 2020, I believe the Indian-American community will overwhelming reject Donald Trump because his anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies run completely counter to our community's story in America.\u201d\n\nTrump delighted \u2014 and surprised \u2014 Indian Americans when the White House announced that he would join Modi at Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams Bright Features at NRG Stadium, home of the National Football League's Houston Texans.\n\nTrump may have agreed to attend to appease Modi after a tense few months between the two leaders, according to some observers of U.S.-India relations.\n\nTrump kicked India out of a trade preference program for developing countries in March and then infuriated Indians again in July by insisting Modi asked him to mediate in the long-standing dispute between India and Pakistan over the region of Kashmir. But the two leaders are now expected to finalize a limited trade deal later this week when they meet for a second time in New York.\n\nTrump may also be fascinated by the popularity of Modi, who \u2014 like Trump \u2014 rode to office on a wave of populist fury and launched a \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign years. Trump previously commented on the number of Modi\u2019s Twitter followers and insinuated last week the Houston rally\u2019s attendees grew because of him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a big crowd coming and I guess the crowd just got a lot bigger because...he asked, would I go, and I will go,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nHouston\u2019s Indian-American community, consisting of roughly 150,000 people, lobbied Modi to visit after he announced he would visit the United States. All 50,000 tickets for the event were claimed in three weeks \u2014 before Trump announced he would attend, according to event organizers. Another 5,000 remain on a waiting list.\n\nA special gesture by @POTUS, signifying the special friendship between India and USA!\n\n\n\nDelighted that President @realDonaldTrump will join the community programme in Houston on the 22nd.\n\n\n\nLooking forward to joining the Indian origin community in welcoming him at the programme. \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 16, 2019\n\nIt will take place in a state that long served as a Republican stronghold but where Democrats are making a play after their party saw significant gains in the 2018 midterms and a series of GOP congressional retirements.\n\nThe rally \u2014 which will be broadcast on U.S. and Indian TV \u2014 will include a cultural program and speeches by Trump and Modi. Thousands of watch parties have been organized across the U.S.\n\nThe first time he ran for office Trump promised to work with Indian Americans. He spoke to 10,000 Hindus waving signs that read \u201cTrump for Hindu Americans at a Bollywood themed event in Edison, N.J., home to a thriving Indian community. \u201cI am a big fan of Hindu, and I am a big fan of India,\u201d Trump said awkwardly.\n\nDuring that campaign, Illinois businessman Shalabh Kumar donated nearly $1 million to the joint fundraising campaign comprised of Trump\u2019s campaign and the Republican National Committee\n\nIn 2016, about 1.2 million Indian-American were registered to vote with Indian-Americans, according to Asian American and Pacific Islanders Data .
