The strike by US military forces on an ISIS convey yesterday did indeed reduce Abu Hassan al-Muhajir to room temperature, leaving ISIS without both its founder and its heir apparent. Donald Trump tweeted out the confirmation earlier this morning:\n\nJust confirmed that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s number one replacement has been terminated by American troops. Most likely would have taken the top spot \u2013 Now he is also Dead! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nThe New York Times also reported confirmation of Muhajir\u2019s \u201cdemise,\u201d as an SDF spokesperson put it:\n\nSyrian Democratic Forces (SDF) General Commander Mazloum Abdi said it was \u201ca continuation of the previous operation\u201d in which Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed over the weekend. Mazloum described the jihadist spokesman as Baghdadi\u2019s right-hand man. Muhajir was killed in the Syrian town of Jarablus in Aleppo province, said the U.S. official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity. The operation which led to \u201cthe demise of his (Baghdadi) No. 2, or one of his No. 2s,\u201d was also carried out by U.S. forces, the official said, adding that the SDF had a big role in it.\n\nThe caveat is worth noting here. The end of Baghdadi and now Muhajir are a huge blow to ISIS, but it\u2019s not the end of their leadership caste either. These groups survive by distributing some authority around in order to protect other cells and columns if one gets compromised. They have other commanders who can take charge, although that process is fraught as well. If Baghdadi had a clear succession plan in place, it might not lead to a civil war within the organization, but usually terror leaders need to play subordinates off each other as a survival strategy. The sudden deaths of the two most well-known emirs will touch off a leadership fight that will also be complicated by suspicions of betrayal after two accurate and timely US/SDF missions decapitated ISIS.\n\nTheir big question might be this \u2014 Who stole Baghdadi\u2019s panties? No, I am not kidding:\n\nIslamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s underpants were obtained by an undercover source and DNA tested to prove his identity before an operation by U.S. forces to kill him, an advisor to the Syrian Democratic Forces said on Monday. Polat Can, a senior advisor to the Kurdish-led SDF, gave details on Twitter about how SDF intelligence work had helped locate Baghdadi, whose death was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday. \u201cOur own source, who had been able to reach al-Baghdadi, brought al-Baghdadi\u2019s underwear to conduct a DNA test and make sure (100%) that the person in question was al-Baghdadi himself,\u201d Can said.\n\nCan we say that a panty raid brought down Baghdadi? Probably not, but we\u2019d sure loooove to say it. Imagine, however, being the man (woman?) tasked with smuggling out the ISIS chief\u2019s skivvies. Talk about drawing the short end of the stick for heroic-operation assignments.\n\nMore seriously, that shows just how close the US and SDF were able to get to Baghdadi without tipping him off. That kind of targeted operation will fuel more paranoia among the remaining ISIS leaders, or at least having then count their boxers before going to bed at night. Those targeted operations are still continuing, too:\n\nThe US is believed to have carried out fresh raids on suspected senior Islamic State members in Syria overnight, as officials assessed a treasure trove of intelligence gathered from Isil leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s final hideout. Helicopters reported to be from the US-led coalition flew late on Monday night into al-Shuyukh village south of Jarablus, around three miles from a raid the previous day that killed Isil\u2019s spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir. \u2026 A spokesman for the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is believed to have jointly conducted the mission, said there had been a \u201csuccessful raid targeting and arresting senior Isil members\u201d on Monday night without elaborating.\n\nThat might have captured some high-value intelligence targets:\n\n\u201cAn Iraqi family had moved there in recent times,\u201d Aghiad al-Kheder, co-founder of anti-Isil activist group Sound and Picture, told the Telegraph. \u201cWe think two men were taken away by the helicopters.\u201d The men\u2019s identity, or relationship to Baghdadi, was not immediately known.\n\nI bet they\u2019re known to other ISIS commanders, though. The sudden success of these raids will not just stoke paranoia about who\u2019s talking to the US, it will force the remaining leaders and assets to look for safer ground and to burn their current comms channels. At best (for ISIS), that risks months of collapse and stagnation, and at worst it will drive everyone out into the open, at least while they make their moves.\n\nThis is why the commentary about Baghdadi\u2019s death and its long-term meaning is both accurate and missed the point. It\u2019s true that the organization won\u2019t collapse just from his demise, or even that of Muhajir too. It does mean that the US and SDF have gotten very good operation intel of late and appear to be rounding up a hell of a lot more as these raids succeed, however, and that might allow the US to roll up significant parts of ISIS in short order. This isn\u2019t the end of these operations by a long shot.", "description": "Did a panty raid bring down Baghdadi?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/trump-schiff.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
