It will play a key role in steering overall strategy and investment in the integrated circuit sector, which includes processors and storage chips used in smartphones and datacenters.\n\nBeijing\u2019s effort to reduce its reliance on American chips is taking on greater urgency as the Trump administration adds more Chinese names to its export blacklist, cutting off the flow of chips to targeted companies from Huawei Technologies Co. to SenseTime Group Ltd.\n\nThe fund\u2019s registered capital comes mainly from state organizations, according to company registration information, which was posted online on Oct. 22.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Finance injected 22.5 billion yuan while an investment arm of China Development Bank poured in 22 billion yuan. It also attracted investment from local governments and state-owned enterprises including China Tobacco, the registration information shows.\n\nChina created its first state-led integrated circuit fund in 2014 to provide backing to major chip manufacturing initiatives, including Tsinghua Unigroup\u2019s multibillion dollar memory chip plant in the central city of Wuhan.\n\nBeijing is trying to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on semiconductor imports worth about $200 billion annually. It fears such dependence undermines national security and hampers the development of a thriving technology sector. The country envisions spending hundreds of billions of dollars to achieve a prominent position in the semiconductor industry -- something U.S. tech executives and government officials have warned could harm American interests.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "China to Funnel $29 Billion Towards its Chip Ambitions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picea014a3ea8b36cca0f211f8cca20ce92.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
