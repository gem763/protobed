(Photo: Phillip Faraone / Getty Images)\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos dropped along with his company\u2019s stock price, losing his title as the richest person in the world to Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates, according to Forbes.\n\nThe e-commerce giant\u2019s stock fell 7%, trading at $1,695 in Friday\u2019s pre-market, after releasing its third-quarter earnings report Thursday, dragging Bezos\u2019s net worth to $102.8 billion. With a net worth of $107 billion, Gates climbed back to the spot he lost in October 2017, Bloomberg says.\n\nThe Seattle-based company reported that it had increased in sales but made less profits than expected. The profit tumble is due to Amazon\u2019s $800 million investment in same-day delivery, announced in April, Bezos said Thursday.\n\nAmazon plunge: One-day shipping attracts more shoppers but puts a dent in profits\n\nThe Amazon CEO\u2019s divorce from MacKenzie Bezos also has a lot do with the defeat. After splitting in January, she received a quarter of the couple's Amazon\u2019s holdings in July.\n\nBack in July, Gates dropped to No. 3 on the world's richest list. A main reason for his downward shift: charitable donations. Gates, who in 2014 stepped down as Microsoft chairman but became a technology advisor for the tech giant, has given away the majority of his Microsoft stake over time.\n\nBernard Arnault, who owns Louis Vitton and Fendi, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet, and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg hold the third, fourth and fifth positions as the world\u2019s richest, respectively, according to Bloomberg.\n\n6-year, 0% loan for a mattress?: Intense competition continues to grip mattress industry\n\nAmazon financials: Online retailer'one-day shipping is attracting more shoppers but putting a dent in profits\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/10/25/amazon-stock-drop-costs-ceo-jeff-bezos-spot-worlds-richest-person/2453507001/", "description": "Amazon's stock price drop has cost CEO Jeff Bezos his spot atop the list of the world's richest people.
