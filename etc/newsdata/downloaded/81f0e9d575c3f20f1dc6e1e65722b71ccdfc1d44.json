(AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Democratic impeachment inquiry may do at least one thing for President Donald Trump: It could give him more incentive to resolve his trade war with China.\n\nAs the political heat rises in Washington, a deal with Beijing would allow Trump to claim a much-needed victory and divert some attention from an explosive congressional investigation into his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nAnalysts say Trump's conflict with Beijing, which has shaken financial markets and further darkened the global economic outlook, could be headed for some tentative resolution in the coming months. Talks between the two countries are set to resume in October.\n\n\"The political mess may now encourage President Trump to accept an imperfect deal with China,\" Hussein Sayed of the foreign exchange brokerage FXTM wrote in a report. \"After all, he needs to prove that he's the master of deal-making, and now is the right time to raise his approval rating higher.\"\n\nAt the same time, however, the impeachment inquiry may have dimmed the prospects for other items on Trump's trade agenda, including his push for congressional approval of a revamped North American trade agreement. That would require backing from the Democratic-led House, and relations between the two parties may now be more inflamed than ever.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings will likely dominate Washington for months, siphoning time and energy from the normal business of government \u2014 debating, compromising, legislating, policymaking. The likelihood of meaningful legislative gains was already slight. Now, it appears even more remote.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham went so far as to assert that the House Democrats' investigation \"destroyed any chances of legislative progress for the people of this country.\"\n\nBy contrast, a tentative resolution in Trump's China trade war wouldn't need congressional approval, one reason for some renewed optimism.\n\nThe world's two biggest economies are engaged in the biggest trade war since the 1930s. The Trump administration alleges that Beijing deploys predatory tactics \u2014 including stealing technology and forcing foreign companies to hand over trade secrets \u2014 in its drive to surpass America's technological supremacy.\n\nTrump has imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese imports and is set to raise the taxes on most of them next month. He plans to tax an additional $160 billion in Chinese goods Dec. 15 \u2014 thereby extending his tariffs to just about everything China ships to the United States. Beijing has retaliated by taxing $120 billion in U.S. imports.\n\nThe U.S. business community is eager for an end to the exchange of tariffs, which has raised costs and created uncertainty about where to situate factories, hire suppliers and sell products.\n\nEven before members of Congress began pursuing an impeachment investigation, Chinese leaders were speculating Trump might want a deal to bolster his political standing, said Willy Lam, a politics specialist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\n\n\"Even though the likelihood of impeachment going through is low, the Chinese will think they hold some kind of advantage over the U.S., and Trump might tend to be more conciliatory given his domestic troubles,\" said Lam. \"He needs a triumph overseas to burnish his position.\"\n\nPresident Xi Jinping also might want at least a temporary agreement to strengthen his own political position as China's ruling Communist Party's Central Committee heads into a key meeting in October.\n\n\"Xi Jinping is anxious to have something to show the Central Committee members on the Sino-U.S. front,\" Lam said.\n\nIt isn't clear what Beijing might be willing to offer as a compromise. Lam said one possibility might be improved protection of foreign patents and copyrights, although Beijing in the past has resisted U.S. demands to write such commitments into law.\n\nThis week, Trump himself suggested that some sort of trade pact with China \"could happen sooner than you think,\" repeating his oft-stated assertion that Chinese leaders \"want to make a deal very badly.\"\n\nCongress is meantime considering whether to ratify one of the Trump administration's signature achievements: a pact reached last year with Canada and Mexico to replace the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.", "description": "The Democratic impeachment inquiry may do at least one thing for President Donald Trump: It could give him more incentive to resolve his trade war with China.
