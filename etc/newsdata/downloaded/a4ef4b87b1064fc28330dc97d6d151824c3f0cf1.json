The partnership will last until January 30, 2020.\n\n\"Through this new partnership we hope to not only champion a more circular future but encourage consumers to consider all the options available to them when they're looking to refresh their wardrobes,\" said Pam Batty, vice president of corporate responsibility at Burberry.\n\nThe announcement is the latest sign of high fashion starting to play nicely with the booming resale clothing market in the United States. Luxury brands have been slow to embrace resale companies because they directly compete with each other for customers, but retailers can no longer ignore the younger, environmentally aware and aspirational luxury shoppers who are turning to the used clothing market.\n\nThe secondhand clothing market has grown 21 times faster than the retail apparel market over the past three years, according to a GlobalData Retail research report featured on reseller ThredUp's website. The resale clothing industry is expected to nearly double from $28 billion today to $51 billion by 2023, the report forecast.\n\nRead More", "description": "Burberry is partnering with luxury reseller The RealReal in the name of the circular economy.", "authors": ["Millie Dent", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191007120410-burberry-trench-coat-file-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
