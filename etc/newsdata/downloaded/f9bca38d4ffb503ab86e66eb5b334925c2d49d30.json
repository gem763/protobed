The immediate question is whether the U.K. and European Union can make the agreement stick, given that Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party is not on board.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s refusal to back the former prime minister Theresa May\u2019s deal ensured it was rejected three times in U.K. parliamentary votes and brought about her downfall. Her successor Boris Johnson seems to be betting that either the hard heads of the DUP will change their minds, or that their support is no longer essential. The first is unlikely, but the second is just about plausible.\n\nThe past 24 hours have been a wild ride. When reports emerged on Wednesday that a deal had been agreed, the DUP leader Arlene Foster was quick to tweet: \u201c\u2018EU\u2019 sources are talking nonsense!\u201d It was a deflating moment for anyone hoping that this was the moment of breakthrough.\n\nAnd yet by Thursday Johnson took the bold step of ignoring Foster and announcing a deal anyhow with EU leaders; as is their wont, the DUP gave it an immediate thumbs down. Getting the famously unyielding unionists to move now would be like trying to rearrange the basalt columns of Giant\u2019s Causeway. Back in 2017, a DUP official said: \u201cThis is a battle of who blinks first, and we\u2019ve cut off our eyelids.\u201d\n\nThis may all seem to be taking tail-wags-dog to a whole other level. The DUP represents a little over one-third of Northern Irish voters. But after the Conservatives lost their electoral majority in 2017, the 10 DUP lawmakers propped up May\u2019s government and have been key to getting any Brexit deal through the House of Commons.\n\nThey\u2019ve been viewed as critical to Johnson winning approval for his deal because a group of hardline Tory MPs who have a deep, ideological commitment to both leaving the European Union and preserving the U.K. one, have been loath to vote for any deal the DUP doesn\u2019t approve. Yet this time the DUP may have overplayed its hand.\n\nThe Brexit ultras in Johnson\u2019s party, known as the Spartans, may be unionists, but their interests and those of the DUP have never been fully aligned. The Spartans want the hardest Brexit possible, and that\u2019s their ultimate priority, rather than the exact form of customs arrangements between the mainland U.K. and Northern Ireland and how exactly consent is given for that by the DUP.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t look like it crosses any of the Spartans\u2019 red lines. They haven\u2019t said so far whether they\u2019ll back him, but some of the noises ahead of the deal\u2019s announcement were positive. They realize if a deal doesn\u2019t pass now, there\u2019s a chance Brexit may never happen. Secure their support, and it\u2019s possible Johnson could win enough votes to pass his deal, as Bloomberg\u2019s Rob Hutton outlined on Wednesday.\n\nMuch depends too on whether Brexit-supporting Labour MPs back a deal.\n\nIt may seem hard to imagine what the DUP gains from its opposition, other than burnishing its own Braveheart reputation by holding out. But the DUP plays a long game. They\u2019re asking themselves whether the new arrangements, which include customs and regulatory checks on the Irish Sea border, will over time make it easier for Northern Ireland to drift toward unification with Ireland. They\u2019re thinking about how unionist voters will regard their support for a deal that doesn\u2019t give them an effective veto over the new arrangements, as Johnson\u2019s original proposal did.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear too that the DUP themselves have been divided over how to handle Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nGetting the EU, Ireland and the DUP to agree was the hat-trick Johnson wanted but for now two out of three will have to suffice. If his deal fails a probable vote in Parliament on Saturday, he\u2019ll have to request a Brexit extension from the EU. This would give the DUP more time to extract concessions.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, will get points for reaching a deal everyone thought was impossible. Even if he loses the parliamentary vote, he\u2019ll be able to tell Britain\u2019s voters he did absolutely everything to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31 or close to it. If he has to go into an election on those terms, he\u2019ll fancy his chances.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- There will be time to study the details of the new Brexit deal and draw conclusions about what side gave in the most, and how it will work in practice.
