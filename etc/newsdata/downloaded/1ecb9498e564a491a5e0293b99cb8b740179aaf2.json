And that simultaneity does not feel like just a coincidence, just correlation without entanglement \u2014 especially when you include other indicators, collapsing birthrates and declining marriage rates and decaying social trust, that all suggest a society suffering a meaning deficit, a loss of purpose and optimism and direction, a gently dehumanizing drift.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Sunday The-Age-Of-American-Despair.Html"], "top_image": ""}
