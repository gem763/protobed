After nearly three hours of sparring between the 10 candidates who qualified, here\u2019s who won, who lost, and what it means moving forward.\n\n[Highlights from the Democratic debate]\n\nWinners\n\nThe Democratic Party: Given this was the first time the cream of the Democratic crop was all on the same debate stage, it took on added significance. And the field was better than it has been. The absence of bomb-throwers who were at 1 percent in the polls helped keep things focused. But even beyond that, the candidates including former vice president Joe Biden (though he still had his poor moments) and Kamala D. Harris (who somewhat fell apart in her closing statement) were generally sharper than they have been. I named President Trump a winner after a previous debate, given how so-so the Democrats were. Party leaders should be more encouraged by what they saw Thursday.\n\nElizabeth Warren: She was not dominant, she had the best performance and, more importantly, the fewest tough moments. Warren seems to come into these debates with a clear game-plan, lots of ideas and \u2014 somewhat inexplicably \u2014 seems almost impossible for her opponents to attack. If that continues to be the case, she reaps the rewards from Biden and Bernie Sanders taking hits. She\u2019s also the only candidate with sustained upward momentum in this race. It\u2019s difficult to see how that doesn\u2019t continue after this.\n\nPete Buttigieg: Buttigieg has been solid and even impressive at basically every debate, and while he may not have wowed anyone or knocked down his opponents Thursday, he was good again. He had perhaps the best argument against getting rid of private insurance for Medicare-for-all, saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re right as progressives that the public alternative is better, then the American people will figure that out for themselves.\u201d He said of Trump\u2019s China trade war: \u201cWhen I first got into this race, I remember President Trump scoffed and said he\u2019d like to see me making a deal with Xi Jinping; I\u2019d like to see him making a deal with Xi Jinping.\u201d And the crowd loved it when he said that on public education, he\u2019d \u201cappoint a secretary of education who actually believes in public education.\u201d They might have been prepared lines, but they didn\u2019t come off as such. Buttigieg is routinely and unfailingly prepared. And his closing answer on coming out as gay came off as genuine and had a real point behind it.\n\nBarack Obama: The last Democratic president has found himself something of an unlikely villain at the first two debates, as Democrats anxious to go further left than his administration distanced themselves from his immigration record, his deals with Republicans and even argued Obamacare is insufficient. But Thursday night, at the first debate at a historically black college since 2007, Obama got more than his share of love.\n\nWe knew that would come from Biden, who launched a campaign ad shortly before the debate hailing his achievements with Obama. But the other candidates also repeatedly hugged the Obama legacy.\n\n\u201cThe senator [Warren] she\u2019s says for Bernie. Well I\u2019m for Barack,\u201d Biden said near the beginning. Warren parried that by saying, \u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama [on Obamacare]. \u2026 Now the question is how best can we improve on it.\u201d Amy Klobuchar said of her more middle-ground approach on health care: \u201cI want to do what Barack Obama wanted to do from the very beginning, which is a public option.\u201d Juli\u00e1n Castro even invoked Obama to attack Biden, when he said Biden\u2019s health care proposal would leave 10 million people uninsured. \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s vision was not to leave 10 million people uncovered,\u201d Castro said. Harris also attacked Biden\u2019s moderation by invoking Obama\u2019s campaign slogan: \u201cInstead of saying no we can\u2019t, let\u2019s say yes we can.\u201d (The audience, though, didn\u2019t seem to pick up on it.)\n\nLosers\n\nCastro\u2019s big attack on Biden: The former Housing and Urban Development secretary clearly came ready to go at this debate, and he went hard at Biden. But his biggest optical win didn\u2019t have substance to back it up. He accused Biden of saying his plan would not automatically enroll people in his public health care option. When Biden denied it, Castro was apoplectic. \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d he said repeatedly, perhaps not subtly spotlighting Biden\u2019s age.\n\nWell, we checked the tape, and Castro was wrong. Biden had said that \u201canyone who can\u2019t afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have, et cetera.\u201d\n\nProsecutors: Both Harris and Klobuchar, as former prosecutors, faced brutal questions about their records \u2014 particularly when it comes to racial justice. Harris responded to reservations about her tough-on-crime record by saying, \u201cI made a decision that if I was going to have the ability to reform the system, I was going to have to do it from the inside\u201d but admitted she hadn\u2019t done enough. Klobuchar was asked about an ACLU official who said she showed no interest in racial justice as Hennepin County, Minn., prosecutor. She did okay with the question, pointing to black kids whose killers she prosecuted. But it was anecdotal, and it wasn\u2019t great. We knew this was a hurdle, especially for Harris; that was certainly the case Thursday.\n\nThe \u2018guys stop arguing\u2019 line: One of the cheapest attempted applause lines at these debates is when candidates complain about their opponents arguing too much. Yes, certain types of attacks can go too far. But on Thursday, a couple candidates tried to pull this out when there were real, substantive debates about big ideas. When Medicare-for-all was at-issue, Harris said, \u201cFrankly, I think this discussion is giving the American public a headache.\u201d At one point, Andrew Yang tried to make a similar point, when Castro cut in and said, \u201cThat\u2019s called a debate.\u201d He was right. You\u2019re supposed to disagree, especially about things as big as potentially spending $30 trillion in government funds and completely revamping American health care. Embrace the debate.\n\nHarris\u2019s zingers: Harris seemed to enjoy her \u201cyes we can\u201d line a lot more than the crowd, laughing pretty heartily. But it wasn\u2019t the only time she did that. At one point, she compared Trump to the Wizard of Oz. (Warning: spoiler ahead) \u201cWhen you pull back the curtain, it\u2019s a really small dude,\u201d Harris said. ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos responded, \u201cI\u2019m not even going to take the bait.\u201d Harris responded, again laughing, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about you!\u201d (Stephanopoulos seemed to be referring something besides his own small stature.) Not exactly disqualifying, sure, but the risk in this stuff is that it won\u2019t exactly land.\n\nYang\u2019s gimmick: Yang previewed before the debate that he would be doing something unprecedented. It turns out that was giving his universal basic income ($1,000 per month) to 10 lucky people who went to his website. But that may run afoul of campaign finance laws. It also seemed to draw some patronizing laughter from his opponents. Yang is a serious candidate; he doesn\u2019t really need to do that kind of thing.", "description": "Who did well, who didn't do so well, and what it means moving forward.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/W2vB3_PzTVRXXxED1K0UACsN__E=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-13-2019/t_0dc6976cdb494a75a6c48cef56083194_name_thumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
