According to Deadline, the producer is making good on his big Warner Bros. TV contract with two new shows, both of which will be goth-sexy. The Shelly Society was co-created by the Riverdale showrunner with writers Tessa Leigh Williams and James DeWille, and it\u2019s described as \u201ca mash-up of gothic horror and teen romance featuring young Mary Shelley.\u201d In other words, you have your sexy Dickinson, Apple TV+, but there are more young literary legends who deserve their own hip reimaginings! In the spirit of that other new teen noir with attractive 20-somethings, Nancy Drew, in The Shelley Society, \u201cYoung author Mary Shelley leads a band of Romantic outlaws\u2014 among them, her lovers Percy and Lord Byron \u2014 against all manner of supernatural threats and monsters.\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa is slated to serve as showrunner.\n\nThe second new series is The Brides, and Deadline describes it as \u201ca vampire soap about empowered, immortal women and the things they do to maintain wealth, prestige, legacy \u2014 and their non-traditional family.\u201d Because the Who-Fucks Industrial Complex, as one Vulture writer described it, demands that the darkness and sexiness of any property be dialed up, The Brides reportedly \u201cleans stronger into horror and sexuality as it reimagines the classic vampire characters.\u201d Horror! Sex! High-priced soap dramas! Without commercial restrictions in place, we can only imagine that Aguirre-Sacasa will let his imagination run truly wild \u2014 like beyond cults and talking to your dead brother\u2019s preserved corpse wild \u2014 for HBO Max.", "description": "Riverdale showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa has been tapped to develop two gothic horror shows for HBO Max in the form of The Shelley Society and The Brides.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/21-Roberto-Aguirre-Sacasa.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
