Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), but she seems to have simpatico in the president.\u2019\n\nThat is Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican who once served as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, sharing his thoughts in an editorial for The Hill.\n\nObviously, with tweets like this \u2014 and there are many \u2014 Trump has made it clear that he\u2019s not a big fan of Warren:\n\nThey do stories so big on Elizabeth \u201cPocahontas\u201d Warren\u2019s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2019\n\nBut Gregg says the two have common ground when it comes to philosophy.\n\n\u201cThe president seems to have a definite tinge of socialism in his chaotic policy closet,\u201d he explained, laying out all Trump actions that \u201ccan best be described as being almost, occasionally, pretty close to socialist.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cme-first, me-only policy\u201d when it comes to global trade, for instance, is \u201cantithetical to the philosophy that has underpinned Republican policy in these areas for years,\u201d Gregg wrote. \u201cInstead, they\u2019re consistent with the policies have given rise to populist politics of the left.\u201d\n\nTrump telling American companies to stop doing business in China is the \u201ctype of edict that might come from the leadership of the old Soviet Union, Cuba or even today\u2019s communist China,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the ultimate in government interference with the free market.\u201d\n\nHis belief that he has the right to direct American commerce \u201cis a startling blunt exercise in socialism,\u201d Gregg added. The tariffs, seen as a massive new tax on the U.S. consumer, are also right out of the socialist playbook, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that U.S. companies need to compete in an international market requires them to be international is lost on this president and his people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey set up a clear list of businesses they deem enemies of the state, and they do not hesitate to use the powers they have to berate them.\u201d\n\nOther socialist-leaning ideologies espoused by the president that Gregg lists in his piece include the desire for a weaker dollar DXY, +0.39% as well as the push for running up debts and deficits.\n\nUltimately, however, Trump can\u2019t really be put in a box.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any core policies, just those ideas that he happens to stumble onto while watching some late night talk show,\u201d Gregg wrote. \u201cSo it is not possible to hang a title on him that claims he is this or that.\u201d", "description": "Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale last week tweeted out \u201cSocialism SUCKS\u201d \u2014 two words capturing a theme that has to be familiar to anybody who tunes in to...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR393_trump_MG_20190916150107.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
