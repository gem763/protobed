During periods of political activism that landed her in actual war zones \u2014 Vietnam or Sarajevo \u2014 she did feel right up against herself and could make common cause with all around her who felt the same. However, nothing could induce her \u2014 neither war nor new love nor her 30 years\u2019 battle with cancer \u2014 to frame a piece through the use of her own immediate experience. Although it was ever the abstract rather than the concrete that sparked her writing imagination \u2014 the political theorist Herbert Marcuse once said disparagingly, \u201cShe can make a theory out of a potato peel\u201d \u2014 it was this very passion for experience in the abstract that gave her the subjects out of which she made glorious a form that had long been neglected.\n\nBut the generative power of the intellectual essay deserted Sontag in midlife and then, desperate to rejuvenate her work, she took (in the opinion of this reviewer) a decidedly wrong turn. In her youth she had written two abstract novels, and then let novel-writing go. Now, in the 1990s, she determined on returning to fiction, and produced two historical novels \u2014 \u201cThe Volcano Lover\u201d and \u201cIn America.\u201d The writing in each of these books is elegant and original, at times even glittering, but at the last it fails to put felt life on the page. The one thing she longed all the years to do \u2014 make art \u2014 lay beyond her powers.\n\nBenjamin Moser\u2019s biography is a skilled, lively, prodigiously researched book that, in the main, neither whitewashes nor rebukes its subject: It works hard to make the reader see Sontag as the severely complex person she was. But Moser doesn\u2019t love her, and this absence of emotional connection poses a serious problem for his book. A strong, vibrant, even mysterious flow of sympathy must exist between the writer and the subject \u2014 however unlovable that subject might be \u2014 in order that a remarkable biography be written. And this, I\u2019m afraid, \u201cSontag\u201d is not.\n\nDuring the course of its 800-plus pages, Moser (who has also written a biography of Clarice Lispector) describes in detail every love affair of Sontag\u2019s, every intellectual position she took, every famous acquaintance she made, every prize and award she received. He praises her for what is praiseworthy and, more or less, holds her accountable for what is not. But it strikes me that because he doesn\u2019t trust his own feelings, he often fails to probe as far as we\u2019d like him to. There are times when this timidity twists his paragraphs into distinctly odd shapes. For instance, in her famous essay on pornography Sontag weaves theoretical constructions for so long that they often seem to fall far from anything that resembles verifiable experience. Here\u2019s how Moser deals with this difficulty:\n\nIn a single paragraph, he tells us that Sontag writes, \u201cWhat pornography is really about, ultimately, isn\u2019t sex but death.\u201d Moser then writes, \u201cThis seems questionable: Pornography, at least for most people, really is about sex.\u201d But come to think of it, he says, \u201cetymology relates pornography to the broader themes in Sontag\u2019s work. In Greek, pornografia means a \u2018depiction of prostitutes.\u2019 And it is not prostitutes but the depiction of them that relates pornography to death. Depictions \u2014 images \u2014 show lives bound toward their undoing.\u201d Huh?\n\nIf I have any other complaint about the book, it is that it is somewhat psychologically reductive. Repeatedly, it returns to the negative influence of the alcoholic mother \u2014 as though growing up the child of an alcoholic could explain a Susan Sontag \u2014 and repeatedly, it dwells on the fame that assaulted rather than gratified her, certainly never put her demons to rest. Somehow, neither of these explorations allows Moser to dive deep. On the other hand, he writes vividly of a woman of parts determined to leave a mark on her time; and makes us feel viscerally how large those parts were \u2014 the arrogance, the anxiety, the reach!
