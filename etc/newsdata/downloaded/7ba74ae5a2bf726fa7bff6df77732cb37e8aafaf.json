James Burnham was a significant mid-20th century figure, a public intellectual and political philosopher who started out on the left\u2014as a young follower he carried on an extensive personal correspondence with Leon Trotsky \u2014and became in time an eloquent foe of totalitarianism in whatever its manifestation. While at National Review, which he helped found, he gave his colleagues 10 maxims or laws about the realities of life. No. 5 is the wholly true, \u201cWherever there is prohibition there\u2019s a bootlegger.\u201d No. 10 has become well known: \u201cIf there\u2019s no alternative, there\u2019s no problem.\u201d\n\nBut most arresting, and richest in inference, is No. 1, which I always pare down to EVERYONE KNOWS.\n\nThe big secret is that it isn\u2019t a secret.\n\nIn its personal application Burnham\u2019s No. 1 Law suggests you can\u2019t successfully or forever conceal anything bad about yourself and your nature, it will all come out and probably has. People see more than you know. Don\u2019t focus on concealment but creation. In political terms it suggests: everyone knows your essential position and future necessities; your close-hold campaign strategies are actually obvious.\n\nFor instance:\n\nEveryone knows Donald Trump can be taken in 2020, but everyone doubts the ability of the current Democratic field to do it. Everyone knows Elizabeth Warren has successfully created and inhabited a persona\u2014the determined, high-energy fighter full of plans\u2014and is killing it. She knows she has gone too far left for the general electorate and will introduce nuance and an air of greater moderation once she gets the nomination. Everyone knows this.\n\nEveryone knows the Democratic moderates are going nowhere and cluttering up every stage, but no one minds their being there because they make the party look sane.\n\nJoe Biden may have about 30% in the polls, but that means all the candidates to his left have about 70%. Mr. Biden\u2019s front-runner status as a perceived moderate (changes in his stands leave him to the left of Hillary Clinton ) doesn\u2019t demonstrate that the party\u2019s primary-goers tilt moderate. It shows they\u2019re mostly progressive, and the perceived moderate is getting that part of the base. The Democratic Party really HAS gone sharply left, and everyone knows.\n\nShall we be rude? Oh, let\u2019s. Everyone knows Donald Trump is a mental case, including I believe Donald Trump. Why else does he keep insisting he is an \u201cextremely stable genius\u201d? It\u2019s as if he knows a lot of people are certain he\u2019s neither.\n\nIt would be nice here to say, \u201cI don\u2019t mean mental case. I mean his mind is a raucous TV funhouse; that he is immature, unserious, and at the mercy of poor impulse control; that he doesn\u2019t exercise power intelligently but emotionally, and with an eye, always to personal needs.\u201d But mental case will do.\n\nHe just fired his third national security adviser, by Twitter , under contested circumstances. They had apparently argued: the president was going to invite the Taliban, that band of gangsters, mooks and morons who housed the terrorists who killed 3,000 of us 18 years ago this week, to Camp David. Camp David! The august retreat where presidents host great nations and great allies. Where FDR met with Churchill and Reagan walked with Thatcher.\n\nNo one who knows what history IS would do this. No one who knows the American people would do it. No one who felt 9/11 in his bones would do it. But a guy going for a cheap handshake and a triumphant photo would. It\u2019s the kind of idea a mental case might readily entertain.\n\nBy my observation something is going on with Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters. They now concede much more about him in private than they did in the past. They use words like \u201cunpredictable\u201d or \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201ca little chaotic.\u201d They say, \u201cWell, he may be crazy but maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s needed to keep his enemies hopping.\u201d He may not be a good man, they concede, but the swamp has defeated good men.\n\nWhat is interesting is that they no longer say what they used to\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ve got it wrong, he\u2019s stable, a successful businessman, a realist.\u201d And they no longer compare him to Reagan.\n\nHis most frequent public defenders now believe he\u2019s a screwball, which is why they no longer devote their time to lauding him but to attacking his critics.\n\nThey\u2019re uncomfortable. He is wearing his own people down.\n\nTo Thursday night\u2019s debate:\n\nThe great question isn\u2019t who got the most time or who got in a good shot, those things are rarely as important as they seem at the moment. The real question is: Did the candidates in the row of podiums show any sign that they are aware they\u2019re going too far left? That they have come across in previous debates as extreme and outside the mainstream?\n\nMaybe a little. There seemed to be some recalibrating. No one bravely declared they\u2019ll outlaw all private health insurance. Ms. Warren in fact repeatedly and rather brazenly ducked the question. It must be showing up in her polls that telling more than 100 million people you\u2019ll take away their health insurance isn\u2019t a \u201cpopular idea.\u201d No one called for open borders, or federal funding for abortions for transgender women. There was a lot of identity politics and autobiography.\n\nMy first impression was that so many of the contenders are such accomplished TV performers with such rounded, practiced sentences that are so dramatically delivered. It is hard to remember but JFK and Nixon were a little shy to be on TV in their 1960 debate, and a little formal. Jimmy Carter, too, 20 years later, with Reagan\u2014they had a certain muted tone. Up until 2000 or so, national TV was a place where you would appropriately feel nervous. Now candidates are so smooth, so TV-ready. Performers in their natural habitat.\n\nThis isn\u2019t new, of course. But each cycle it seems a little more so, and a little more unsettling.\n\nMs. Warren was relatively quiet, almost recessive during the first half, and emerged unscathed as Bernie Sanders and Mr. Biden went at each other. Mr. Biden was fine. As Mr. Sanders spoke and gesticulated in his wide and ranty way I remembered that sometimes the thing that works against you is also what works for you. He comes across like your angry Menshevik uncle in the attic, but like that uncle he means what he says, is sincere and convinced, and that has its own power.\n\n***\n\nI close with a last thing everyone knows, if they only think a minute. When we talk about politics we all obsess on alt-right and progressive left, those peas in a sick pod, and no one speaks of the center, which is vast and has something neither way-left nor way-right has, and that is a motivating love for America itself, and not for abstractions and ideologies and theories of the case. As a group they are virtually ignored, and yet they are the center of everything. They include those of the left who are no longer comfortable in a new progressive party. And rightists not comfortable with Mr. Trump, or with the decisions and approaches of the Bush era. It includes those experiencing ongoing EID\u2014extreme ideological discomfort.\n\nIn this cycle they continue to be the great ignored.
