As is so often the case, instead of a meaningful policy, Trump offers a gesture.\n\nDevising a real alternative would require this admission: in the Middle East, the military power of the United States has played a large part in exacerbating problems rather than contributing to their solution. With few exceptions, members of the establishment, Bret Stephens among them, lack the gumption to make such an admission.\n\nThe beginning of wisdom lies in acknowledging that the overriding U.S. interest in the Middle East is to restore stability. Period. It is not to pick winners. Stability requires not more war but less, nudging rivals such as Iran and Saudi Arabia\u2014neither qualifying as \u201cfriends\u201d of the United States\u2014to realize that they too will benefit from reducing the level of violence. No doubt this qualifies as an enormous challenge, requiring patience and diplomatic sophistication. But to quote an old adage, perhaps it\u2019s time to give peace a chance. And should Tehran and Riyadh disregard such peacemaking efforts and opt for war, well, it is not incumbent upon the United States to underwrite their folly.", "description": "", "authors": ["Andrew Bacevich", "Theamericanconservative.Com Articles Yes-Trump-Please-End-The-American-Era-In-The-Middle-East"], "top_image": ""}
