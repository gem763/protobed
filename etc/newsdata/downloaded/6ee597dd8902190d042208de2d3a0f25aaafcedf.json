The UK used to be a major global power and a fast-growing economy, but GDP growth has been consistently below 5% annually since the late 1980s.\n\nThe chart below shows the performance of ETFs representing the United Kingdom (blue) Germany (green) France (teal) and the world (red). The UK, Germany, and France are the largest economies in Europe, and just for good measure we threw in an ETF representing the world as well. While all of these funds have gone up in value since the start of the year, the UK has underperformed.\n\n(Source: TradingView; iShares MSCI FTSE ETF, iShares MSCI DAX ETF, iShares MSCI CAC 40 ETF, iShares MSCI World ETF. Data as of September 11th, 2019.)\n\nNear the beginning of that period, January 31st, 2019, the index that I work on, VIEQX, had a weighting of 4.95% in the United Kingdom - whereas a cap-weighted index gave them a weighting of 10.03%.\n\nWe gave them a relatively low weighting for several reasons: One, their policy trend score was far below the average, ranking 31st out of 39 countries. They had particularly bad scores for the 1-year change in cost of starting a business and effective trade tariffs.\n\n(Source: Bowyer Research)\n\nThe UK lacks the resiliency that you might expect from a country with their history, being only slightly better than the average of our 39 countries. Their fiscal fitness score is also far below average, ranking just above the bottom at #38.\n\n(Source: Bowyer Research)\n\nBecause cap-weighting tends to be past-weighting, an approach based on principles will tend to underweight countries such as the UK relative to a cap-weighting approach.\n\nIt\u2019s been years since the United Kingdom\u2019s economy grew at an annual rate over 5%, and they\u2019re only ranked #14 out of 39 countries for resiliency. Events such as Brexit happen; every nation at some point goes through periods of economic turmoil that disrupt markets, but being highly resilient helps you withstand those shocks, and growing rapidly helps you bounce back. At the start of this year, the United Kingdom didn\u2019t fit into either of those categories.", "description": "A prime example of the difference between a cap-weighted and .09/12/2019 19:44:31PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Bowyer", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/16/09c13019-67e1-4e66-8be9-51be0fc02227.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
