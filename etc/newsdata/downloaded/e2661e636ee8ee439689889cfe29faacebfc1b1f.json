(Courtesy of Jessica McNutt)\n\nFor a couple of D.C. newlyweds, a Mystics win over the Connecticut Sun in the deciding Game 5 of the WNBA Finals on Thursday would be the ultimate, if slightly belated, wedding present.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jessica McNutt and Scott Suchyta were decked out in Mystics gear at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., where Washington erased a 16-point deficit in the third quarter of Game 4 before losing, 90-86. A few hours earlier, the couple was signing paperwork at the town hall in nearby Montville, where Mayor Ronald K. McDaniel put his Sun fandom aside and legally pronounced them husband and wife. McNutt wore a red Elena Delle Donne jersey during the marriage ceremony. Suchyta wore Kristi Toliver\u2019s No. 20.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fairly nontraditional people,\u201d McNutt, who grew up in Tennessee and idolized legendary Volunteers coach Pat Summitt, said in a phone interview on Wednesday, shortly before she and Suchyta were scheduled to fly home to D.C.\n\nToday, my husband and I celebrated by getting married. IN CT. IN our Mystics jerseys. When the judge asked about the significance of this day, we said \"today is the day the Mystics become WNBA champions!\" We are so proud of this team! #RunItBack #WNBAFinals pic.twitter.com/bXrNyuPbFg \u2014 Jessica McNutt (@TheMysticsFan) October 8, 2019\n\nMcNutt and Suchyta met at work three years ago and became close through their shared love of sports, especially the WNBA. They\u2019ve had Mystics season tickets together since 2017, when they traveled to New York City to see Washington\u2019s win over the Liberty in the second round of the playoffs. After getting engaged over dinner at Minibar this summer, they celebrated with a trip to Minneapolis to see a Minnesota Lynx game, before heading to Chicago to see the Mystics take on the Sky. Their goal is to see a WNBA game in every arena.\n\nGetting married in Connecticut was never part of the couple\u2019s plan, but when their close friend who had agreed to serve as the officiant at a small gathering of friends and family in D.C. later this month told them on Monday he could no longer attend, they improvised.\n\n\u201cWe were like, 'Well, we\u2019re here, and these games are at a casino,\u201d said Suchyta, who flew to Connecticut with McNutt on Sunday, ahead of the Mystics\u2019 94-81 win in Game 3.\n\nAlas, the Mohegan Sun doesn\u2019t have a walk-in wedding chapel, which is why, after some quick research, Suchyta and McNutt ended up filling out an application for a marriage license with the town clerk of Montville. When asked about the significance of the day, they replied that the Mystics would clinch their first title that night.\n\n\u201cThe mayor was available to be the officiant, so he performed the wedding ceremony, and it all worked out great,\u201d said Suchyta, who got into women\u2019s basketball as a student at Ohio State.\n\n\u201cThere was some banter about sports and the game,\u201d McNutt said of the mayor\u2019s reaction upon seeing their Mystics jerseys. \u201cIt was pretty cool.\"\n\nWhile McNutt and Suchyta have no intentions of renewing their vows with a second marriage ceremony in D.C. this month, the celebratory gathering they planned at Oyamel will go on as scheduled.\n\n\u201cThe first reaction from friends and family [when they found out we got married] was congratulations,\u201d McNutt said. \u201cTheir second reaction was, \u2018We\u2019re still having dinner, right?\u2019\u201d\n\nWith her nervous energy running high before Game 4, McNutt said she joked with Suchyta that he might have to remind her they were married afterward. While the Mystics\u2019 comeback bid ultimately came up short, McNutt said the day, like Washington\u2019s record-breaking season, was a success.\n\n\u201cI got a flood of text messages from friends that were watching the game,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the start of the season, they wouldn\u2019t have been watching the WNBA. I got messages from season-ticket holders that we\u2019ve come to be friends with over the past couple of years. It\u2019s hard to be so disappointed in the grand scheme of things. It\u2019s just so much fun and so exciting, and just the best sports experience you could ever ask for.\u201d\n\n\u201cReflecting on the day and the experience as a whole, it was awesome,\u201d Suchyta said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to forget getting married and coming up to Connecticut for these games. Regardless of the outcome of Game 5, we\u2019ll have gotten to see all of these games in person. \u201d\n\nThe couple has yet to plan a honeymoon, but France is on their shortlist of potential destinations. Suchtya is fluent in French, while McNutt has connected with a few Mystics and Emma Meesseman fans from Belgium on social media. For now, all of their focus is on Thursday\u2019s Game 5 in D.C.\n\n\u201cI just want the city to rally around the team,\u201d Suchyta said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty special case to have a winner-take-all scenario for the championship in your hometown. I hope everyone shows up loud and proud and really makes it an unforgettable atmosphere to drive the team and give them the energy that they need. Just let the team know that they\u2019re supported for their hard work.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Courtesy of Jessica McNutt)\n\nRead more on the Mystics:\n\nThe Mystics will try to block out the noise and close out the WNBA Finals at home\n\nIn Game 4, the Mystics came all the way back \u2014 and nearly won \u2014 thanks to their bench\n\nElena Delle Donne says herniated disk feels like 'having a pole up my back\u2019\n\nDJ Heat, once a Mystics ballgirl, now spins the soundtrack for a playoff run\n\nThe inaugural Mystics almost never won.
