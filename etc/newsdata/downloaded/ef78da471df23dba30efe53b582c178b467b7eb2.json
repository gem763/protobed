Her only problem is that she is really impulsive and has a bad temper.\n\nLast weekend, my boyfriend of seven months, \"Dan,\" went to dinner with a friend from law school who just so happens to be a woman. I didn't go because I knew they'd have more fun just the two of them, and his friend only had the one night before she had to fly out.\n\nKathy was in the same restaurant on a date and she saw Dan laughing and talking with a strange woman. Unfortunately, she didn't bother talking to him, just called him a cheating scumbag and dumped his water on his food. When she got home she texted me a picture of them together, and I immediately explained the situation to her and called Dan.\n\nHe wouldn't let me come over. He said the incident shook up his friend and ruined their night.\n\nDan now doesn't want anything to do with Kathy, but said he knows how close we are so he won't ask me to cut her off. He said he needs some time to think things over.\n\nI haven't seen him since the incident. I'm devastated. I'm in love with Dan, which is why I think Kathy went off like she did. She texted him an apology. He won't accept it, but he also keeps telling me I have nothing to apologize for. How can I fix this so he doesn't break up with me?\n\n\u2014 My Problem Now\n\nMy Problem Now: You don\u2019t \u201cfix this\u201d to protect yourself from a breakup \u2014 that\u2019s just looking out for your own interests.\n\nYou fix this because someone behaved wretchedly on your behalf at others\u2019 expense, and those people need to be made whole.\n\nTechnically Dan is right that you have nothing to apologize for, and right to stay out of your relationship with Kathy. Not his business. (Whom he associates with is his business, though, so he\u2019s entitled to opt out of all things Kathy.) And, of course, there\u2019s no way you can give Dan and his friend their evening back.\n\nHowever, none of this means you\u2019re out of options \u2014 or off the hook.\n\nAs Kathy\u2019s friend, you have standing to say, \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nThe impulsive behavior, the temper, the lack of boundaries, none of these is just an annoying quirk for her friends to brush off \u2014 and the \u201ctexted him an apology\u201d? That\u2019s inexcusably weak.\n\nYet with your focus on what to say to Dan, you\u2019ve essentially excused Kathy with a tacit \u201cthat\u2019s just how she is.\u201d\n\nYour friend needs help. Embarrassing herself, putting innocent people through an ugly scene and jeopardizing a relationship that\u2019s precious to one of her closest friends? That\u2019s the kind of screw-up trifecta that can wake a person up to this fact. Apparently it wasn\u2019t for Kathy.\n\nSo please recognize this as your responsibility in \u201cfixing\u201d this, your way to try to make Dan and his friend whole. He\u2019ll get over this or he won\u2019t, but either way you can square up and not give Kathy a pass. Not anymore. \u201cWhat you did is not okay; it\u2019s time to get help for your temper.\u201d\n\nAssuming she lets you, you can be at her side as she does.", "description": "An embarrassing scene at a restaurant has to be a turning point.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "September At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
