REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nWith Trump leading his own defence in a series of increasingly hyperbolic tweets, his allies are clamouring for the type of messaging they can use to battle the impeachment probe during appearances on cable television news shows, a key source of information for many Americans about the unfolding drama.\n\nOne ally said attempts to get information from the White House to use on television to defend Trump had not yet produced what was needed.\n\n\u201cJust tell me what it is and I\u2019ll promote it for you,\u201d said the ally, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey\u2019re not responding.\u201d\n\nSaid another: \u201cThere is no cohesive outside messaging. You have to wait to see the tweets.\u201d\n\nWhite House advisers, aware that Trump himself is impatient that more people defend him on television, are discussing how best to deal with the challenge that will consume Trump for months, a senior administration official said.\n\nThe official, who requested anonymity given the confidential nature of the discussions, told Reuters that officials had not gone into hyperdrive over the issue only because the Democratic-led House of Representatives has yet to vote to formally launch an impeachment probe.\n\nOne option they are discussing to confront the challenge includes bringing in a lawyer to serve as the main official dealing with impeachment, in the same way attorney Emmett Flood led the White House effort during U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump colluded with Russia during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, a source close to the White House said.\n\nThere has been some talk among officials about possibly bringing Flood back to the White House, the source said.\n\nFlood could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAnother source close to the administration was hopeful that the White House would create an operation that included political communications and coordination with Capitol Hill, where Republican lawmakers are battling impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that there are many people inside and outside the White House that want to see the Republican pushback be a serious and thorough operation \u2014 call it whatever you want, a war room or a political operation,\u201d the source said. \u201cThere needs to be a sense of urgency that we don\u2019t see from the outside.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. Democrat, last week announced plans for an impeachment inquiry following the disclosure of a July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which the U.S. president asked for help in looking into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden\u2019s ties to Ukraine.\n\nTrump has said he considers the inquiry unfair and that his conversation with Zelenskiy was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that they\u2019re prepared for what\u2019s about to occur,\u201d said one source familiar with the president\u2019s thinking.\n\nThe struggle to defend Trump on television has already become evident.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s high-profile defenders in Congress, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, said in an interview on CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired on Sunday that \u201cthe president did nothing in this phone call that\u2019s impeachable.\u201d\n\nBut McCarthy would not specifically address whether it was appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Biden. Nor would he discuss a Republican strategy for defending Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not something that you have to defend here,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nAnother prominent House Republican, veteran U.S. Representative Greg Walden, was asked by a reporter on Friday whether there was a need for investigating a federal whistleblower\u2019s complaint related to the Trump-Zelenskiy phone call. Walden responded, \u201cThey\u2019re (Democrats) going to do what they\u2019re going to do\u201d and then abruptly ended his conversation with reporters.\n\nEarlier in the week, Walden issued a statement saying the phone call \u201cwasn\u2019t President Trump\u2019s finest moment.\u201d He added that the call fell short of meeting the threshold for impeachement proceedings, however.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far it certainly does not rise to \u2018high crimes and misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d Walden said.", "description": "Some allies of U.S. President Donald Trump say they are eager to defend him against impeachment allegations but have been confounded by the White House's inability to settle on a clear strategy for confronting the charges.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1436014279&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903FO"}
