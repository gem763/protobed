On one side was a community of outsiders frustrated by corporate control. Their outpost was something like a worker\u2019s paradise \u2014 they were well fed and mostly happy, surviving by relying on each other. I admired their leader, Adelaide, for the passion that she had for her people. On the other side was the corporate-owned town they left, led by Reed Tobson, an idiot that didn\u2019t seem to realise that asking his workers to only eat canned fish (for protein!) led to the population being ravaged by plagues.\n\nDespite how much I hated Tobson, he was right that the people working for him suffered because of the workers that had abandoned the town to form their own community.\n\nI still don\u2019t know if I did the right thing.\n\nThe choice I would make would destroy one of these two communities permanently. I managed to find an in-between option, which disbanded the outpost of deserters but also allowed for deep reforms in the town. I was satisfied with this for a short while, but when I got back to my ship, I saw that I\u2019d received a bit of memorabilia from my adventure: a town sign. As I sidled up to examine it, its description told me that I had taught the deserters something important about their dream of a life without corporations: to never dream.\n\nThe universe that The Outer Worlds takes place in is bleak. Halcyon is a corporate-owned colony consisting of two planets of workers, a mining outpost on an asteroid, a ship called the Groundbreaker that acts as a waystation for groups of workers going to and fro, and a prison planet. Things are in dire straits, as the workers suffer low wages and long hours while the wealthy live in a gilded city, unconcerned with their plight.\n\nSeveral questions drive the game: How do you create the ideal society? And who is at fault for bringing this one to its knees? What adequate punishment exists for those responsible, if there is one at all? The Outer Worlds acts as a mirror this way; you answer these questions via the myriad choices you can make in the game, your moral standing met with visible consequences. You can also avoid all these questions in favour of just shooting everyone you see and taking everything in sight, though as time goes on, you will see how your selfishness affects the people around you.\n\nYou play a variable that the corporations hadn\u2019t accounted for in their quest for total economic and social control. The scientist (and outlaw) Phineas Welles has unfrozen you from 70 years of cryogenic sleep. You were a passenger on the colony ship The Hope, which houses some of the greatest scientists, artists, and philosophers Earth had to offer but never made it to its destination after being knocked out of its planned route.\n\nWith their help, Welles thinks that Halcyon can recover, but he needs you to find the chemicals he needs to wake up the rest of the colonists, who have been frozen for so long that they would otherwise experience what Welles calls \u201cexplosive cell death\u201d upon being thawed. Your perspective as someone outside of the colony is one that will eventually shape its future.\n\nThe Outer Worlds BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE What happens to a dream deferred? TYPE OF GAME Class struggle simulator LIKED Extremely thoughtful writing paired with gunplay that's just as sharp. DISLIKED Because the game sets the bar high, the places where the writing doesn't go far enough are glaring. DEVELOPER Obsidian PLATFORMS PlayStation 4 (played), Xbox One, PC, Switch (eventually) RELEASE DATE October 25, 2019 TIME PLAYED Around 40 hours\n\nBeing frozen for 70 years has some advantages: You gain \u201ctactical time dilation,\u201d which allows you to slow down time for combat. By slowing down time, you can target specific body parts that will temporarily give your enemies debuffs. Shooting an enemy in the eyes will blind them, making their shots less accurate. It\u2019ll also allow you to reposition yourself, to peek out of cover with just enough time to take down an enemy and run to waist-high wall.\n\nThe weapons themselves are fun enough to use that even though I tried to talk myself out of violence as much as I could, I never dreaded violence when it occurred. You can find and buy different modifications for your weapons and armour that change how they work, making almost every weapon and armour set work for every playstyle. If you like the hunting rifles but need something that takes out the automechanicals (robots that often have guns), you can add a mod that changes their damage type to shock rather than physical. If you like a certain set of heavy armour but need to sneak by a couple enemies, you can modify that set of armour so that the sounds of your footsteps are quieter.\n\nThe Outer Worlds serves the player\u2019s needs mechanically at every turn. As you level up, you can unlock perks for even more abilities, like the capacity to carry more items, recharge your tactical time dilation faster, or get a little health with each kill. You can also take on flaws, which will allow you to unlock another perk while giving a permanent debuff to your character. Flaws unlock based on your own weaknesses as a player. If you get sprayed by acid too many times, you can take on a flaw that makes acid that much harsher. I ended up not taking on any flaws, wanting not to continue to suffer for the ways I am deficient as a player, though I can see how this system will drive other players to change up their strategies in order to grab that one perk they were hoping for.\n\nThese gun fights are fun and sometimes satisfyingly tricky, but it\u2019s hard to get around the elephant in the room when it comes to Obsidian games. Yes, The Outer Worlds mechanically resembles the Fallout series. It was made by the same team that worked on the first two Fallout games as well as Fallout: New Vegas. It\u2019s built on the skeleton of Dungeons and Dragons, with the player assigning points in perception and intelligence in character creation and as you level up.\n\nYou will have to pass checks on those stats to unlock dialogue options that allow you to finish quests in different ways. This is not dissimilar to what Fallout has become under the ownership of Bethesda, though I will say that I have not felt as motivated to finish Fallout 3 or 4 as I felt to finish The Outer Worlds. The writing is centred, focused on getting the player to confront its class struggle, the universe built with that goal in mind. As a bonus, it\u2019s also quite funny. Early on in the game, I laughed as a corporate guard told me that they were busy dealing with marauders, and worse: parking violators.\n\nIf you see fit, you can even side against the scientist who unfroze you, Welles. The Outer Worlds will challenge you to make hard choices in your quest to find a better way of life, offering viewpoints that run directly counter to your own in a way that always felt fair and compelling. By the end of the game, I felt like I understood my own politics better.\n\nThe key to making this feel naturalistic is by challenging the player to really commit to their ideals. When I first encountered the Iconoclasts, a faction of sorta socialists that are dedicated to their cause with a cult-like fervor, their community starved under a leader who spent far more time on empty rhetoric than on praxis. (In a turn that made me laugh, he\u2019s also a former journalist.)\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the leader of the Iconoclasts is a pretty bad person, but on the other hand, under the control of the corporations, workers don\u2019t have bathroom breaks or weekends. If you play your cards right, you\u2019re probably going to find a way to stay true to yourself without leaving people in power that aren\u2019t serving their communities. But in order to get that far, you\u2019ll have to actively care, and the game provides enough deep character writing to give you avenues to care about what happens to the people of Halcyon.\n\nYou companions act as guideposts to the many different walks of life that make up Halcyon. Their personal quest lines reveal as much about these characters as the world itself. Parvati is so used to not belonging that when she meets someone that she\u2019s interested in romantically, she doesn\u2019t know how to handle it. Her quest is both an examination of what it is like to be a square peg unable to fit in a round hole as much as it is a touching queer love story.\n\nVicar Max, like other followers of his faith, is looking for peace in some kind of grand design, to make an uncertain world make sense. He is also, as the kids would say, daddy. One of my favourites, Felix, is an orphan who is fleeing Groundbreaker after starting a fight with his foreman over sports. He isn\u2019t well-read, but his convictions are strong \u2014 he doesn\u2019t need to study theory to know that workers are being exploited. Your companions will have strong reactions to the main story quests and the decisions you make in them. In fact, it was Parvati\u2019s reactions in that first quest that led me to the choices I ended up making.\n\nNo matter your politics, you\u2019re not going to finish The Outer Worlds without addressing issues of labour head-on. I\u2019m a union rep for Kotaku, and at times playing this game reminded me of the things we talk about in our meetings: How do we meet the needs of the workers, how do we placate the bosses?\n\nAs someone not contracted by a corporation, you\u2019re referred to as a \u201cfreelancer\u201d by quest givers, which amused me. One quest even had me negotiating between striking workers and their boss. Labour is at the centre of everything in Halcyon. The issues that are destroying the colony are directly related to the division of wealth between bosses and workers. Halcyon feels full and complete \u2014 at the edges of your understanding of its history lies the implication that nearly a century of life has unfolded in this colony.\n\nHalcyon being called a colony certainly made me bristle at times, though conveniently, there are no sentient races that the colonisers have displaced. In The Outer Worlds, all social problems are filtered through class. Sexism and racism don\u2019t meaningfully exist even though race does; many of the people you meet across classes are black and brown.\n\nRace and gender go essentially unacknowledged from the game\u2019s core narrative to its tongue-in-cheek riffs on PR buzzwords, which was frustrating in a game so deeply embroiled in power dynamics. In our world, class and race are inexorably tied, and a world in which questions of class are more eternal than questions of race strikes me as dishonest. I trust in Obsidian to broach those issues with the same grace as they do issues of class, so I wish they had gone there.\n\nThe Outer Worlds is so impactful that it made me question and ultimately settle more thoughtfully into my beliefs. My game ended with what felt like a utopian, worker-led vision for Halcyon, and the game gives you the room to enact whatever your personal vision may be. It pushed me without feeling preachy and gave me some fun shootouts between the politicking. In the end, The Outer Worlds aligns itself with Hughes. The dream of paradise that Halcyon has deferred exploded. How you pick up those pieces is up to you, for better or worse.", "description": "The very first quest in The Outer Worlds, Obsidian\u2019s highly anticipated first-person RPG out October 25, asked me to make what felt like an impossible choice.
