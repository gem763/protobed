But also a bad sign for the country. https://t.co/RTNVwhzufo \u2014 Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) March 6, 2019\n\nA predictable swarm pounced.\n\nMathew Dowd of ABC News is a good stand-in for one objection:\n\nWhy would dnc agree to having Fox News do this after what they have become? \u2014 Matthew Dowd (@matthewjdowd) March 6, 2019\n\nAndrew Kirell, a senior editor at the Daily Beast, is a good stand-in for another.\n\nA few responses.\n\nFirst, I completely understand why many progressives dislike Fox. And while there\u2019s much I can\u2019t defend on the opinion side of Fox, it\u2019s easy for me to defend the work of people like Bret Baier and Chris Wallace and the Fox News division. If you go back and look at any of the debates hosted by Fox \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 you will be hard pressed to find any evidence that they were anything other than professional.\n\nSecond, this isn\u2019t about defending Fox. Fox is the most watched cable-news network. And if you think there are zero voters out there that Democrats need to reach out to, then this isn\u2019t a big deal. But that\u2019s simply not the case. I was merely making an analytical point. In a world where millions of people voted for both Obama and Trump, the idea that the Democrats don\u2019t need to speak to audiences outside of their base is just dumb, even if Democrats feel they don\u2019t get a fair shake from Fox.\n\nThird, there\u2019s Kirell\u2019s \u201ctoo easy\u201d tweet and its imitators. He\u2019s right: It is too easy. I\u2019ll start with another analytical point. The GOP in 2016 did have legitimate reason to be annoyed with MSNBC. But shunning MSNBC was not the same thing as shunning all of the liberal or MSM media. The GOP worked with CNN, CNBC, CBS, and ABC in 2016. The simple fact is there is an asymmetry here. Fox is the only mainstream right-of-center news network (which is one of the reasons it\u2019s number one in the ratings). When the Democrats shun Fox, they are shunning an audience they might not be able to find elsewhere. Shunning MSNBC for CNBC or CNN or ABC doesn\u2019t present the same problem.\n\nThen there\u2019s a personal response: I\u2019ve changed my mind. I don\u2019t know what Joe Scarborough said specifically to elicit that response from me. But whatever it was, I\u2019m in a different place now. I\u2019ve been fighting against the polarization and tribalism afflicting both the right and the left quite a lot over the last few years since then \u2014 and I have the scars to prove it. I even wrote a book on the topic. The reason I changed by mind is not that I think Scarborough\u2019s reasoning at the time was wrong, but because I think the cycle of people refusing to hear from \u2014 or talk to \u2014 people they don\u2019t like is getting unhealthier by the day. I think Democrats should go on Fox News more and Republicans should go on the other networks more. Everyone is talking to their own bases at the bottom of their own vertical silos, making them ever more comfortable into turning their political opponents into abstract and evil cartoons. This decision is just one more small example of that dynamic. Whether you think Fox deserves this or not is irrelevant because deserve ain\u2019t got nothing to do with it.\n\nSo yeah, it\u2019s too easy. It\u2019s too easy because I changed my mind because the facts changed.
