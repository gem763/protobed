After spending the summer growing, Pete the maidenhair fern, has begun taking its own selfies at an \u201castonishing\u201d rate, according to the team.\n\nHe is currently taking a photo every 20 seconds.\n\nWe're glad to see our animals aren't the only ones who've taken an interest in Pete, our maidenhair fern who's become the worlds first plant to take a selfie. https://t.co/gzzKvs6DPn https://t.co/fgeQRXMDLI pic.twitter.com/tg0hhKEwYX \u2014 ZSL London Zoo (@zsllondonzoo) October 16, 2019\n\nZSL\u2019s conservation technology specialist Al Davies said he has been \u2018working so well we\u2019ve even accidentally photo-bombed him a few times\u2019.\n\n\u2018Seeing Pete\u2019s first selfie was an incredible moment for the ZSL team who have spent months monitoring and supporting his growth at ZSL London Zoo\u2019s Rainforest Life exhibit.\n\n\u2018Plants naturally deposit biomatter as they grow, which in turn feeds the natural bacteria present in the soil, creating energy that can be harnessed by fuel cells and used to power a wide range of vital conservation tools remotely, including sensors, monitoring platforms and camera traps.\u2019\n\nPete could be the trailblazer for remote rainforest photography (PA)\n\n\u2018Most power sources have limits \u2013 batteries must be replaced while solar panels rely on a source of sunlight \u2013 but plants can survive in the shade, naturally moving into position to maximise the potential of absorbing sunlight \u2013 meaning the potential for plant-powered energy is pretty much limitless.\u2019\n\nThe ZSL team is planning to continue to refine the technology before setting up a second trial in the wild.", "description": "Photo-synthesis?", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Pete-the-fern-311b_1571238471.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
