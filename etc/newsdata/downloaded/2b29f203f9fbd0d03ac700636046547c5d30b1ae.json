Group M, a media investment adviser, recently estimated that the 2020 election would generate $10 billion in political advertising, up 59% since 2016, when the number was a mere $6.3 billion \u2014 and far outpacing 2002, when the total was $2.1 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s a quirky business, though. Kantar, an ad analysis group, predicts that 43% of all that political advertising in 2020 will be seen in battlefield states.\n\nOn a historical note, a learned source has pinpointed the dawn of negative political advertising \u2014 and it is a lot earlier than we thought.\n\n\u201cThe origins of negative campaigning probably concur with the emergence of political competition and electoral campaigns. Sources go back to 64 BC, when Quintus Tullius Cicero, probably among the first spin-doctors in the world, drafted a letter of advice to his brother, Marcus Tullius Cicero, then running for the consulate. He insisted on including \u2018negative campaigning\u2019 in the campaign, to remind the people \u2018of what scoundrels your opponents are and to smear these men at every opportunity with the crimes, sexual scandals, and corruption they have brought on themselves,\u2019\u201d notes a new analysis from French Politics, an academic journal which also citing the 1800 presidential race between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson as an example of an aggressive historical campaign.\n\nBut let\u2019s get back to that $10 billion \u2014 which also looks like this: $10,000,000,000. It is a lot to spend on political advertising. Inquiring minds want to know if the expense is worth it for those doling out the money.\n\nIt could be for some, says Dan Granger, CEO of Oxford Road, a Los Angeles-based ad agency that also analyzes the effectiveness of advertising spending for the Super Bowl.\n\nThe real $10 billion question is this: Are political ads a waste of time and money?\n\n\u201cOnly for the candidates who have no chance. Otherwise, it\u2019s the most important investment the candidates can make. What other platform do they have to reach their constituents with 100% control of their message?\u201d Mr. Granger tells Inside the Beltway.\n\nGETTING JITTERY\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s campaign continues to raise a record-breaking amounts of money; the grand total of incoming funds has now hit $141 million. Rivals are jittery.\n\n\u201cI just heard some disturbing news: The Republican National Committee raised $23.5 million for Trump and his Republican enablers last month. Let me put those fundraising numbers into context. The RNC now has as much cash on hand as it did in September 2016 \u2014 right before Trump got elected. Republicans are funneling money from their huge (and rapidly growing) war chest into critical battleground states,\u201d notes Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez in a new outreach to his flock.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to fall behind this early in the race. The stakes are too high and the consequences too grave for four more years of the Trump administration,\u201d he continues. \u201cI\u2019ve told you before that we don\u2019t have to match Donald Trump and his enablers\u2019 fundraising hauls dollar for dollar \u2014 but there may come a point that the RNC\u2019s money machine becomes too powerful for Democrats to stand a chance. We can\u2019t risk that happening,\u201d Mr. Perez concludes.\n\nTHE GREAT DIVIDE\n\nGallup finds that President Trump has a 43% approval rating, which is not too shabby. The partisan divide on this finding, however, is unprecedented. The pollster reveals that 91% of Republicans and 5% of Democrats approve of the president.\n\n\u201cThe 86-point gap in Republican and Democratic ratings of the president ties the highest Gallup has measured in a single survey,\u201d reports analyst Jeffrey M. Jones.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that President Obama also generated an astonishing partisan gap in 2012, when 6% of Republicans and 92% of Democrats approved of him.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush is the only other president who has had a gap of 80 or more percentage points in approval rating by party. Most of those measurements came during the fall of 2004, as he was seeking reelection, with a high of 83 points in Sept. 13-15 (95% Republican, 12% Democrat) and Oct. 1-3 (94% Republican, 11% Democrat) polls,\u201d writes Mr. Jones.\n\n\u201cPrior to Bush, only Ronald Reagan had registered a party gap in approval rating of at least 70 percentage points in any single poll, doing so in two separate polls during the fall of his reelection year of 1984,\u201d he continues.\n\nBut buckle up.\n\n\u201cThe historical pattern of greater party polarization in job approval during incumbent presidential election years suggests there could be new standards set next year when Trump tries to win a second term,\u201d Mr. Jones advises.\n\nA NOTABLE ARRIVAL\n\nRepublic Book Publishers is about to arrive to the media marketplace, to be launched next week at a swell gathering in the nation\u2019s capital. The event is hosted by Al Regnery, the point man behind Regnery Books \u2014 home to such authors as Laura Ingraham, Michelle Malkin, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Mark Levin. The co-host is Eric Kampmann, also a titan of the publishing world.\n\nRepublic Books has a clear mission statement that explains all:\n\n\u201cWith the advent of national conservatism, a new debate has arisen, a debate that needs to be defined by new conservative writers and thinkers in books \u2014 books that will help establish the direction of the movement and assist its efforts to have a lasting impact,\u201d the pair say. \u201cThe books Republic publishes will be right-of-center titles, written by experienced writers as well as emerging writers well versed in the subject matter of their writing.\u201d\n\nPOLL DU JOUR\n\n\u2022 22% of U.S. adults are unsure what nation is America\u2019s \u201cgreatest foe\u201d; 11% of Republicans, 30% of independents and 19% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 22% overall think Russia is the greatest foe; 11% of Republicans, 17% of independents and 36% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 17% overall cite China; 27% of Republicans, 17% of independents and 8% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 16% overall cite the Taliban; 21% of Republicans, 14% of independents and 15% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 12% overall cite Iran; 19% of Republicans, 12% of independents and 6% of Democrats agree.\n\n\u2022 11% overall cite North Korea; 10% of Republicans, 9% of independents and 16% of Democrats agree.\n\nSource: An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 U.S. adults conducted Sept. 14-17.\n\n\u2022 Helpful information to [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
