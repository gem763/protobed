Lawyer and author David Stewart explains. Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The U.S. diplomat who called President Donald Trump\u2019s demand for Ukraine to investigate a political rival in exchange for military aid \u201ccrazy\u201d takes center stage Tuesday, as the House impeachment inquiry enters its fifth week.\n\nOther witnesses scheduled for closed-door depositions with the three committees \u2013 Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight and Reform \u2013 include budget and defense officials. Democrats leading the inquiry have said they want to learn more about how Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid while asking Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nHouse Republicans expect to vote Monday on a resolution censuring the leader of the inquiry, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif. A Republican leader also proposed to change House rules so that any lawmaker could attend the sessions. Republicans have complained about limited access to the sessions.\n\nMonday: GOP calls for Schiff censure\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Friday there would be a vote Monday on a resolution to censure Schiff. The resolution is unlikely to be approved because Democrats hold a majority in the 435-member chamber, but it is co-sponsored by 165 Republicans.\n\nMcCarthy said Schiff has lied repeatedly during the investigation of Trump. McCarthy argued that Schiff should be held to a higher standard as chairman of the Intelligence Committee because he is privy to information that rank-and-file members don\u2019t receive.\n\n\u201cHe has tried to hide so many of the facts, and then when he was put in position to give the facts, he lied about them,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe should be held accountable just like every other member.\u201d\n\nDespite GOP complaints, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has repeatedly supported Schiff's leadership in the inquiry.\n\n\"I'm very proud of the work that Adam Schiff is doing,\" Pelosi told reporters Thursday. \"And this isn't about politics or partisanship. It's about patriotism for our country, and I value the way he is conducting this with equal time on all sides for the questioning that are there.\"\n\nThe censure vote comes after Republicans who aren't on the three key committees tried repeatedly last week to attend the closed-door sessions. But lawmakers were blocked at the door, under a ruling from Schiff and the House parliamentarian.\n\nThe second-ranking Republican in the House, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., introduced a resolution Friday with Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., to allow all lawmakers to attend all impeachment proceedings including closed-door depositions and transcribed interviews.\n\n\u201cThe American people's elected representatives have been denied access to relevant documents and the opportunity to attend depositions and transcribed interviews,\u201d Scalise said in a statement. \u201cChairman Schiff wants to impeach President Trump behind closed doors and clearly has no intention of conducting a fair and open process.\u201d\n\nSchiff has said the closed sessions are necessary to prevent witnesses from hearing each other's testimony, as happens in a criminal investigation. But Schiff said he anticipates transcripts of the closed sessions will be released and public hearings will be held.\n\nSchiff also said Republicans on the committees and their staffers have been given unlimited time to ask questions of the witnesses. The parties typically alternate an hour or 45 minutes at a time for each side, during sessions that have lasted as long as 10 hours.\n\n\"All of the members of these three committees have been invited to attend and participate and ask questions,\" Schiff said Tuesday. \"They have been very professionally done.\"\n\nTuesday: \u2018Crazy\u2019 Ukraine policy\n\nWilliam Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, questioned Trump\u2019s Ukraine policy in texts revealed as part of the inquiry. Taylor is scheduled to testify privately Tuesday before the House inquiry.\n\nOn Sept. 1, Taylor asked Kurt Volker, the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, whether security assistance and a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky depended upon an investigation.\n\nSondland told Taylor to call him. But Sept. 9, Taylor repeated his concern in another text.\n\n\"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nSondland later said that he called Trump before responding that the assertion was \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland said in a text message, which he said relied on the president\u2019s assurance.\n\nSondland testified Thursday that he was disappointed that Trump delegated Ukraine policy to his private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Sondland also said he wasn\u2019t aware that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden or that military aid was withheld.\n\nBut acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that military aid was withheld for a Ukraine investigation of interference in the 2016 election. Trump urged Zelensky to investigate the Bidens during a July 25 call.\n\nTrump has insisted he was absolutely justified in asking Ukraine to fight corruption.\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, center, arrives for a joint interview with the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Capitol Hill in Washington, Oct. 17, 2019.

But the Defense Department and the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have defied House subpoenas for documents about the funding.\n\nPat Cipollone, the White House counsel, notified the House on Oct. 8 that the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the investigation because the House hadn\u2019t voted to authorize it. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said no vote is needed after she declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24. Schiff has warned that the House could consider defying subpoenas could be considered obstruction of justice in any articles of impeachment.\n\nDespite the administration\u2019s defiance, several officials such as Sondland have testified. The House inquiry scheduled closed-door meetings:\n\nWednesday with Philip Reeker, the acting assistant secretary of State for the European and Eurasian Affairs, and Michael Duffey, the associate director for national security programs at OMB.\n\nThursday with Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of Defense, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nRuss Vought, the acting director of OMB, tweeted Monday that Duffey wouldn't be cooperating with the inquiry, as explained by the White House letter.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee, tweeted Saturday that scheduling two witnesses per day was part of an \u201cunfair & partisan impeachment\u201d because lawmakers couldn\u2019t attend both depositions at once.\n\nSchiff has said staff lawyers tend to ask most of the questions, but that lawmakers are invited to the sessions and allowed to ask questions.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-diplomat-questioned-ukraine-policy-crazy/4025110002/", "description": "What's up in the House impeachment inquiry in Week 5?
