Scott Marr was found lying unresponsive at his Nebraska home.\n\nMarr was rushed to nearby Methodist Hospital, where doctors said he had likely suffered a stroke, reported World-Herald.\n\nHowever, Marr\u2019s condition quickly worsened with severe swelling on his brain. He had to be placed on life support, the news outlet stated.\n\nWOMAN'S CHEST PAIN DIAGNOSED AS 'SPIRALING ESOPHAGUS': WHAT'S THAT?\n\nThe next day, doctors looked over the former basketball announcer\u2019s condition, but it didn\u2019t look good. Doctors didn\u2019t expect him to survive.\n\nThat\u2019s when Marr\u2019s four children had to make a difficult decision.\n\nAfter meeting in his hospital room to say goodbye, the family decided to take the 61-year-old off life support, according to the World-Herald.\n\nThe family planned to prepare for a funeral the next day.\n\nTEEN ALIVE AND WELL AFTER CAR LANDED ON TOP OF HIM IN MEDICAL MIRACLE\n\nHowever, something miraculous happened. Rather than fading away as expected, Marr began responding. Slowly, he was able to smile and move his hands and toes, said the report.\n\nAccording to Inside Edition, his daughter Preston had to rub her eyes to make sure it was real.\n\nLater, imaging revealed that Marr actually had posterior reverse encephalopathy syndrome (PRES).\n\nAccording to a report published in the American Journal of Neuroradiology, the condition often shows symptoms such as a severe headache, changes in vision or nausea.\n\nPRES symptoms can vary widely among patients, but experts have observed that many have high blood pressure in conjunction with the condition.\n\nHowever, MRI scans show marked similarities in PRES patients, making the condition easier to diagnose with imaging.\n\nDoctors stated that severe swelling wasn\u2019t one of the common symptoms, reports Inside Edition. That likely led to the doctors\u2019 initial misdiagnosis.\n\nThankfully, PRES includes a good prognosis and ability to manage, as was the outcome in this case.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFollowing Marr\u2019s miraculous survival, he was able to go through speech and physical therapy and was then released from the hospital, reported World-Herald.\n\nMarr\u2019s family now calls him the \"miracle man.\"", "description": "T.
