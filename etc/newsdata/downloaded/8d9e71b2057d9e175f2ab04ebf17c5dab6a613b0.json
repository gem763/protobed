While the left claims the measure doesn't impact taxpayer migration or hurt state tax revenue, a new study conducted at Stanford University finds the opposite.\n\nThe report reveals a 2012 income tax increase drove away many high earners. As a result, the state only netted about half the revenue gains it expected. The increase in 2012 jumped from 10.3 percent to 13.3 percent and the measured departure rate for high-income earners rose from 1.5 percent to 2.125 percent.\n\nTOMI LAHREN: GOV. NEWSOM 'ABSOLUTELY DELUSIONAL' TO CLAIM CA HOMELESS CRISIS IS BEING SOLVED\n\nAppearing on \"Fox & Friends\" with hosts Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt and Brian Kilmeade, the \"Making Money\" host said the results of the finding seemed obvious.\n\n\"I think the most important thing here is when they cobble these things together, and they say 'Hey, this is what's going to happen; this is how much we're going to make from it.'

You talk about an unmitigated disaster...,\" said Payne.\n\n\"What about Rush Limbaugh leaving New York?\" Kilmeade joked. \"We still haven't recovered.\"", "description": "California's tax plan is \"so egregious\" that\u00a0people of every socioeconomic background are leaving the state, host of \"Making Money\" Charles Payne said Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Charles-Payne-1-SF-FOX-iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
