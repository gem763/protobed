He'd sort out Brexit in a jiffy!", "language": "en", "text": "My heart sinks every time a newscaster says: \u2018And now, we go to the town of Market Snodbury to find out what people think of the latest on Brexit.\u2019\n\nFor the next five minutes, I know I\u2019m going to have listen to bores I\u2019d take pains to avoid if I spotted them coming my way in a pub or on a high street. Where do they find them?\n\nBy now, the citizens of the quaint old market town of High Dudgeon have grown accustomed to being quizzed about their views on Brexit by reporters from all the main TV and radio channels. I decided to pop along myself to find out what they make of all this attention.\n\nMy heart sinks every time a newscaster says: \u2018And now, we go to the town of Market Snodbury to find out what people think of the latest on Brexit,\u2019 writes CRAIG BROWN (stock image)\n\n\u2018We had that Gary Gibbon from Channel 4 here yesterday,\u2019 said Scott Chegg, 62, sitting in the bar of the Bowls\u2019 Club. \u2018I told him I can\u2019t help you \u2014 I\u2019m already booked to appear with Kirsty Wark of Newsnight, and then I\u2019ve promised to deliver an update on my opinions to a young man from LBC.\u2019\n\nIn the old town pub, The War Horse, most of the tables are taken up with groups of four being pressed for their opinions on the latest news from Westminster.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve had to open up the garden to accommodate a further six interviewers,\u2019 says the landlord. \u2018Mind you, can\u2019t complain. If they weren\u2019t giving their opinions to the interviewers, they\u2019d be forcing me to listen to them.\u2019\n\nI took the opportunity to eavesdrop on one of the sessions. Two men and two women were being asked about Brexit. One was for remaining in the EU at all costs, one was for leaving with no deal, one was for leaving with a deal, and the last was backing a second referendum.\n\n\u2018We offer ourselves as a package deal,\u2019 one told me. \u2018We\u2019re popular with producers because a) we always stick to cliches and b) we\u2019re a complete cross-section.\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s right,\u2019 agreed Arthur Daley, an executive in the motor trade. \u2018They love us because we promise to say \u201cSeventeen point four million\u201d, \u201cNo one ever voted for No Deal\u201d, \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, \u201cThose of us who live in the real world\u201d, \u201cTime we moved on\u201d and \u201cAbsolute disgrace\u201d.\n\n\u2018Once we\u2019ve ticked all those boxes, they can pack up and move on.\u2019\n\nOver the past few years, television producers have worked out that sending a camera crew to the Dudgeons to film disgruntled townsfolk is so much easier than trying to find experts, or \u2018so-called experts\u2019, as they are now known.\n\nArthur Daley, an executive in the motor trade, said: \u2018They love us because we promise to say \u201cSeventeen point four million\u201d, \u201cNo one ever voted for No Deal\u201d, \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d, \u201cThose of us who live in the real world\u201d, \u201cTime we moved on\u201d and \u201cAbsolute disgrace\u201d,' writes CRAIG BROWN. Pictured: Character Arthur Daley (left) in an episode of Minder\n\nBut crisis hit the town of Low Dudgeon last week, when the supply of sick and tired locals ran dry.\n\n\u2018Over the past few years, we\u2019d filmed every single citizen of Low Dudgeon seven times over, sounding off about everything from the Conservative leadership contest to the Norway Option,\u2019 complains TV current affairs producer Greg Slick. \u2018The trouble is, they were forced to trot out their opinions so often that even they were sick to death of them.\n\n\u2018Some had even switched from Remain to Brexit and back again, just to keep themselves fresh. So we were obliged to employ an agency to supply us with professional actors who specialised in trotting out tired old opinions.\u2019\n\nAccordingly, they sent a message to the neighbouring town of Peevish, twinned with Pique, where there is such high demand for round-table panel discussions that a local entrepreneur has formed Brexit Or Remain Enterprises (BORE), which puts worldwide media organisations in touch with disgruntled ordinary folk who enjoy sounding off.\n\nChief executive Geoff Slippery says: \u2018We make it clear that experts, or people who know anything about the subject, need not apply. Nor do we want anyone with an original opinion because then they\u2019re not respresentative, are they?\n\n\u2018In fact, we only need people who are happy to nurse a grievance and can be trusted to say any or all of the following ten cliches:\n\n1: \u2018Take back control\u2019\n\n2: \u2018Only in it for themselves\u2019\n\n3: \u2018I\u2019m European and proud of it\u2019\n\n4: \u2018They just don\u2019t get it, do they?\u2019\n\n5: \u2018No one voted for No Deal\u2019\n\n6: \u2018Metropolitan elite\u2019\n\n7: \u2018Three and a half years!\u2019\n\n8: \u2018Sick and tired\u2019\n\n9: \u2018Project Fear\u2019\n\n10: \u2018Well, this is it, isn\u2019t it?\u2019", "description": "CRAIG BROWN: My heart sinks every time a newscaster says: 'And now, we go to the town of Market Snodbury to find out what people think of the latest on Brexit.'", "authors": ["Craig Brown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/01/19814802-0-image-a-109_1571271612459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
