He was 62. The company confirmed Hurd's death to CNBC but declined to provide a statement. In an email obtained by CNBC, Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison informed employees that Hurd had died early in the morning. \"Oracle has lost a brilliant and beloved leader who personally touched the lives of so many of us during his decade at Oracle,\" Ellison wrote. \"All of us will miss Mark's keen mind and rare ability to analyze, simplify, and solve problems quickly. Some of us will miss his friendship and mentorship. I will miss his kindness and sense of humor.\" Hurd announced a leave of absence from Oracle in September due to unspecified health reasons. \"Though we all worked hard together to close the first quarter, I've decided that I need to spend time focused on my health, Hurd said in the announcement. \"I love Oracle and wish you all success during my absence.\" He and Safra Catz were appointed as CEOs of Oracle in September 2014. Oracle stock had gone up about 37% since then.\n\nSafra Catz and Mark Hurd when they were named CEOs of Oracle in 2010.

First, a scandal broke out in 2006 over attempts to determine who at HP leaked information to the media. Outside investigators, pretending to be the people they were researching, presented the last four digits of the Social Security numbers of board members and news reporters to telephone operators to obtain details on their phone calls. \"While many of the right processes were in place, they unfortunately broke down and no one in the management chain, including me, caught it,\" Hurd said on a conference call with reporters at the time. Board members left, federal agencies began investigations, and Hurd testified before a congressional committee. HP agreed to pay $14.5 million in a settlement with the California attorney general. Then in 2010, HP share prices tumbled 8% after the tech company announced his resignation amid a sexual-harassment claim against him. HP concluded that although Hurd had not violated the company's policy on sexual harassment, he did fail to comply with its standards. In a letter to Hurd, lawyer Gloria Allred described his meetings with Oracle contractor Jodie Fisher in various cities and said he had made undesired advances to her client. Hurd's lawyer, Amy Wintersheimer, later said the letter was filled with inaccuracies and the allegations were never proven. Hurd's expense reports included meals with his security guard, Denis Lynch, but the meals were with Fisher, and over time most of HP's board members came to feel they had lost trust in him, The Wall Street Journal reported. Hurd settled with Fisher, who had once modeled for Playboy magazine, for undisclosed terms.\n\nMark Hurd, then HP CEO, speaks at a news conference at company headquarters on Sept. 22, 2006.
