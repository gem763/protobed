As Iran counterattacked into Iraqi territory, Baghdad\u2014supplied and armed by the Soviet Union, France, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia\u2014began blasting Iranian oil tankers with missiles, often with assistance from U.S. surveillance assets.\n\nIran retaliated by targeting Kuwaiti tankers with imported Chinese Silkworm missiles. Though terrifying, both side\u2019s anti-ship missiles inflicted relatively little damage as the tankers were simply too bulky to be easily sunk. The same was not true for the frigate USS Stark, struck accidentally by an Iraqi Exocet missile in May 1987 that killed thirty-seven crew.\n\nBut Washington had an axe to grind with Tehran, not Baghdad\u2014and decided to respond to pleas for military escort from Kuwait. This led to the controversial policy of reflagging Kuwaiti tankers so they could be escorted by U.S. warships in Operation Earnest Will.\n\nThe supertanker Bridgeton\u2014formerly the Kuwaiti tanker al-Rekkah\u2014was the first ship to receive a U.S. escort. Upon entering the narrow Straits of Hormuz, a flight of four Iranian Phantom jets swooped towards the Bridgeton convoy, but turned away at the last minute. On July 23, Tehran rumbled that tanker was carrying \u201cprohibited goods\u201d but made no obvious moves\n\nU.S. intelligence had learned of Iranian plans to attack the convoy with motorboats operated by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy. Indeed, the head of the IRGC had lobbied for such an attack but was vetoed by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini. He had a subtler approach in mind.\n\nAs the Bridgeton cruised eighteen miles west of Iran\u2019s Farsi Island on the morning of July 24, she abruptly struck what resembled a spiked-ball chained to the sea floor\u2014a variant of an old Soviet M-08 mine built by North Korea and exported to Iran. An explosion ripped a large hole the tanker\u2019s port cargo tank, flooding five of her thirty-one compartments but not injuring any crew.\n\nThe night before, IRGCN motorboats had lain three chains totaling sixty mines spaced a half-kilometer part along the convoy\u2019s well-known path.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "But at a price.", "authors": ["Sebastien Roblin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/03fp5r5w_4zP7PLkJ2gaTA--~B/aD0xMDI1O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a07a99e17c3c3491e99e1f7867fc4933", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
