One friend makes their prediction of who will win in November 2020, and the other nods in agreement. But then the voices become hushed as the second person asks, \"But do you really think the other side will accept the results?\"\n\nWe've experienced the peaceful transfer of power for 230 years, including the constitutionally messy outcomes in 1876, 1888, 2000 and, well, 2016 for that matter. No tanks rolled through the streets and no shadow governments operated from underground bunkers even when the guy with the most votes didn't end up in the White House.\n\nSo why in 2019 do so many Americans -- across party lines -- believe that if their candidate loses next year it can only be because the election was rigged?\n\nHere's one place we can look: For the third time in his presidency, Donald Trump has an 86-point gap between what Republicans and Democrats think about him, according to the latest Gallup approval poll . Ninety-one percent of Republicans approve of his job performance to date, while only 5% of Democrats feel the same.\n\nWe are still 16 months away from Election Day. But Americans on both sides appear primed and ready to vote.\n\nJust four years ago , only 32% of voters said they were \"extremely interested\" in the 2016 election. But this week, that same poll shows 59% are extremely interested this time around. And if you only include self-identified partisans, the number jumps into the 60s.\n\nAnd with stakes this high, Democratic voters appear to be grappling with their own dilemma: vote for a candidate who best exemplifies their visceral loathing for Donald Trump or vote for the candidate who is most likely to beat him?\n\nCurrent polling shows the race for the Democratic nomination is tightening between Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren. But that doesn't mean voters are picking between them.\n\nThe polls are pretty clear that Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters would prefer to vote for Elizabeth Warren. They think she's won every debate so far. And as the 20,000 people who showed up to her New York City rally this week can attest, she leads Biden in voter enthusiasm by double digits.\n\nBut nearly half of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters believe that Biden is best positioned to beat Trump. Barely 1 in 10 think that of Warren.\n\nIf history is any indication, there's every reason to suspect the partisan divide heading into 2020 will get worse. After all, that 86% gap just means we have 14% more to go.\n\nAll of this is a big problem for Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAs David Leonhardt noted in the New York Times this week, Warren has struggled to win blue collar workers (you remember: the ones that gave Trump his narrow wins in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania?) in her own state of Massachusetts since 2012. She underperformed even her fellow down ballot Democrats in the last election. Voters on both sides of the aisle in these swing states are tuned in and eager to vote, but Biden out performs her in a head to head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin by 9 points , for instance.\n\nOf course, Joe Biden has his own lurking shadows. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, who has developed her following based on her progressive appeal and solid debate performances, Biden's standing with the Democratic electorate seems largely driven by fear\u2014fear of losing again to Donald Trump. If she can assuage that fear\u2014or if another candidate can prove more viable\u2014Joe Biden could be looking at a swift and total collapse.\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion's new newsletter.
