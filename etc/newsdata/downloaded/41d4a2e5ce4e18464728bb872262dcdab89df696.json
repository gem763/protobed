REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nIn one of the most striking flourishes of the three-year Brexit drama, Johnson confounded his opponents on Thursday by clinching a new deal with the EU that had promised it would never reopen a treaty it agreed last year.\n\nYet Johnson, the face of the Brexit campaign in the 2016 referendum, must now ratify the deal in the British parliament where he has no majority and opponents are plotting maximum political damage ahead of an imminent election.\n\nThe numbers are too close to call: Johnson must garner 318 votes in the 650-seat parliament to get a deal approved. Yet his Northern Irish allies are opposed to a deal and the three main opposition parties have pledged to vote it down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday,\u201d Johnson said ahead of the first Saturday sitting of parliament since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nIf he wins the vote, Johnson will go down in history as the leader who delivered Brexit - for good or bad. If he fails, Johnson will face the humiliation of Brexit unfurling after repeatedly promising that he would get it done.\n\nJohnson won the top job by staking his career on getting Brexit done by the latest deadline of Oct. 31 after his predecessor, Theresa May, was forced to delay Britain\u2019s departure date after parliament thrice defeated her deal by a margin of 58 to 230 votes.\n\nDowning Street is casting the Saturday vote as a last chance to get Brexit done with lawmakers facing the option of either approving the deal or propelling the United Kingdom to a disorderly no-deal exit that could divide the West, hurt global growth and trigger violence in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cPRETTY CLOSE\u201d\n\nYet the future of Brexit remains uncertain as Johnson\u2019s opponents have passed a law demanding he delay Brexit unless he gets a deal approved.\n\nThe government has said it will both comply with this law and that Britain will leave the EU on Oct. 31 whatever happens. Johnson has not explained how he plans to take these two apparently contradictory steps.\n\nAs lawmakers mull one of the United Kingdom\u2019s most significant geopolitical moves since World War Two, hundreds of thousands are due to march towards parliament demanding another referendum on EU membership.\n\nParliament will sit from 0830 GMT on Saturday. Johnson will make a statement to lawmakers, followed by a 90-minute debate and then there will be a vote.\n\nThe Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it would oppose the deal and lobby a faction of around 28 hard line Brexit supporters in Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party to do the same.\n\n\u201cWe will be encouraging (other lawmakers to vote against) because we believe it does have an impact on the unity of the United Kingdom, will spark further nationalist sentiment in Scotland and will be detrimental to the economy of Northern Ireland,\u201d the DUP\u2019s Sammy Wilson said.\n\n\u201cVoting this down tomorrow is not the end of the game, in fact it probably opens up possibilities for the government which are not available at present after a general election.\u201d\n\nWithout the DUP\u2019s 10 votes, Johnson will need Brexit-supporting Labour Party rebels to support his deal.\n\nAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, October 17, 2019.

NO ARCHIVES\n\nSaturday\u2019s vote will be \u201cpretty close\u201d but likely just fall short, John McDonnell, the second most powerful man in the opposition Labour Party said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it will pass, I think it will be defeated but... the numbers are going to be pretty close,\u201d McDonnell told Sky News.\n\nIf the vote is a tie, then the speaker of parliament, John Bercow, would hold the deciding vote. According to vague convention, the speaker would seek to keep the issue open for further discussion.", "description": "Britain's exit from the European Union hung on a knife-edge on Friday as Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrambled to convince doubters to rally behind his last-minute European Union divorce deal in an extraordinary vote in parliament.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442208568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0LH", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
