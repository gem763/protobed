The character formed an upside-down \"OK\" symbol with his fingers, recognized by some as a hate symbol, on the girl's shoulder, according to a photo and video reviewed by USA TODAY.\n\nA Universal Orlando Resort spokesman said Tuesday in response to USA TODAY inquiries about the episode that the actor had been fired. The spokesman, Tom Schroder, initially declined to further comment but then issued a statement:\n\n\"We never want our guests to experience what this family did. This is not acceptable and we are sorry \u2013 and we are taking steps to make sure nothing like this happens again. We can\u2019t discuss specifics about this incident, but we can confirm that the actor no longer works here. We remain in contact with the family and will work with them privately to make this right.\"\n\nTiffiney Zinger, who is black, and her husband, Richard Zinger, who is white, traveled with their daughter, who is now 7, and her younger brother from Colorado to Orlando, where they own a home.\n\nThe Zingers were at Universal Orlando for the day to attend the character breakfast at the Loews Royal Pacific Resort, a Universal hotel, at 11 a.m. on March 23. The hotel hosts the event every Saturday.\n\n\"We just wanted to take them to see the minions,\" Tiffiney Zinger said. \"Do something special for our family and this person ruined that special warm feeling.\"\n\nHate symbols: 'OK' hand gesture added to growing list of hate symbols for white supremacy\n\nThe Zingers say they did not initially notice what happened with the actor. But while going through vacation photos in mid-August, they noticed the controversial symbol.\n\nThe couple began digging deeper into their smartphone photos and videos to find more evidence of what they were seeing. Finally, they landed on a video taken at the same time of the picture that confirmed their worst fears.\n\nIn the 29-second clip, Zinger's daughter is being directed to stand by the Gru character. As she excitedly walks toward him, he gestures for her to stand to his side. The Gru character first places his hand behind her shoulder. Then, the character moves his right hand on top of her shoulder and curls his thumb and index finger into a clearly visible \"OK\" symbol. The gesture has become a symbol of concern because it has been used by white supremacists and other far-right extremists.\n\nZinger's 2-year-old son also posed in the shot next to a minion.\n\nUSA TODAY is not naming the Zingers' children to protect their privacy and has blurred their faces in content published with this story.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than the \u2018OK\u2019 sign,\u201d Richard Zinger said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand what that sign means.\u201d\n\nThe incident happened a week after the New Zealand shooter, who killed 51 people in two Christchurch mosques in March, flashed the \"OK\" symbol during his court appearance.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League added the hand gesture to their online database \"Hate On Display\" last week, which is a longstanding list that provides explanation for symbols memes and slogans that are frequently used by white supremacists and other hate groups.\n\nWhite supremacy in America: Can parents stop online radicalization?\n\nHowever, the hand symbol has had many meanings before it evolved into an expression of hate. Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at Southern Poverty Law Center, said the symbol began showing up about four years ago as an online trolling tactic used by white supremacists.\n\nBeirich says they like to \"photobomb\" images with hate symbols and then share them online as an inside joke or prank.", "description": "A family is shaken and looking for answers after they say a Universal Orlando actor displayed a hateful gesture in a vacation photo and video.", "authors": ["Adrianna Rodriguez", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MJ2rhe5JAREu99Q8dd2U4Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/6b3d3a83-3466-49ef-acf6-b497280d5e42/909f0629-3ab3-588f-8109-3469297198e2/data_3_0.jpg?s=face91c567d6c58a04e28bb38bb2139c&c=dd55b65a5964c698a704eaa956ae56b8&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0"}
