To make it, the vegetables are slicked with plenty of olive oil, then roasted until tender and browned, their juices mingling and condensing. Toward the end of the cooking time, goat cheese and olives are sprinkled on top. The cheese melts and becomes creamy, while the olives heat up and turn plump and tangy. Serve this as a meatless main dish, with crusty bread and more goat cheese, or as a hearty side dish to a simple roast chicken or fish.\n\nFeatured in: Ratatouille, Simplified And Just As Satisfying.", "description": "Cooking ratatouille on a sheet pan in the oven isn\u2019t just easier than cooking it in a pot on the stove, it\u2019s also better: richer and more deeply caramelized in flavor To make it, the vegetables are slicked with plenty of olive oil, then roasted until tender and browned, their juices mingling and condensing Toward the end of the cooking time, goat cheese and olives are sprinkled on top", "authors": ["Melissa Clark", "Elaine Louie", "Jerrelle Guy", "Mark Bittman", "Kay Chun", "Alison Roman", "Margaux Laskey", "The New York Times", "Nigella Lawson", "Clare De Boer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/dining/30apperex/30apperex-articleLarge.jpg"}
