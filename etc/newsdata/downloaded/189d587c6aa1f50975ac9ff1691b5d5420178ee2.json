His last four months under Trump were the \u2018antithesis\u2019 of that.", "language": "en", "text": "But in the summer of 2019, he and his colleagues were sending a very different message to Ukraine.\n\nInstead of encouraging government officials to follow the letter of the law, U.S. diplomats were pressuring Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit President Trump politically in the 2020 election, Taylor told House investigators Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was the antithesis of a big part of his career. And my guess is that really bothered him,\u201d said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who has known Taylor for 25 years.\n\nThat experience of policy whiplash is what many of Taylor\u2019s current and former colleagues said led to his transformation from a typically low-key diplomat to the man who delivered an unsparing critique of the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policy.\n\nThe texts, emails and phone conversations Taylor recalled to lawmakers have provided the most detailed account to date of an alleged quid pro quo between Trump and the Ukrainian government and exposed contradictions in the testimonies of other U.S. officials who have denied knowing that the president was pushing Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Taylor\u2019s testimony, the White House derided the \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats\u201d taking part in a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign\u201d against the president, invective that probably will make Taylor\u2019s job more difficult as foreign officials question his standing within the administration. The top diplomat to Ukraine returned to his job in Kyiv on Wednesday, said a person familiar with his movements, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity as Taylor continues in his job.\n\nAD\n\nIn a tweet Wednesday, Trump called Taylor a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d and expressed frustration that he was hired in the first place. \u201cIt would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats. Nothing good will ever come from them!\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe State Department has not issued a statement in defense of Taylor and did not respond to a request for comment about whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would keep him in that job despite the president\u2019s criticisms. Taylor was hired for a six-month assignment and has about two months left.\n\nAD\n\nFor the half-dozen current and former colleagues of Taylor\u2019s who spoke to The Washington Post, the diplomat\u2019s explosive testimony stood in stark contrast to his understated professional demeanor. His former colleagues were particularly amused by the White House\u2019s attempt to categorize him as a \u201cradical.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing exciting about Bill,\u201d said George Ingram, a former senior official for the U.S. Agency for International Development who worked with Taylor in Moscow in the late 1990s. \u201cThat speaks to the type of person he is. He\u2019s a straightforward, by-the-book, stand-up guy who is going to follow the rules and regulations.\u201d\n\nTaylor had retired from the Foreign Service but accepted his current job in Kyiv four months ago at the request of Pompeo following the unceremonious ouster of the former U.S. ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch.\n\nAD\n\nIn his testimony, Taylor said his wife urged him in \u201cno uncertain terms\u201d to turn down the job, but he accepted it anyway after consulting one of his mentors.\n\n\u201cIf your country asks you to do something, you do it \u2014 if you can be effective,\u201d the person said, according to Taylor\u2019s 15-page opening statement.\n\nAD\n\nIn previous administrations, Washington has linked U.S. aid to Ukraine\u2019s pursuit of anti-corruption efforts. But in the scenario methodically laid out by Taylor, almost $400 million in security aid was withheld to encourage the Ukrainian president to appear on CNN to announce an investigation into Biden\u2019s son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened,\u201d Taylor told lawmakers, reflecting on the moment in a July conference call when a White House official said a hold was being put on security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nThe efforts by diplomats working at Trump\u2019s direction were \u201crunning contrary to the goals of long-standing U.S. policy,\u201d he testified.\n\nPifer said the attempted arrangement must have exasperated Taylor. \u201cHe had been telling the Ukrainians dating back to the 1990s about what they had to do to build a modern, robust economy, and a big part of that was fighting corruption,\u201d Pifer said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohn Herbst, another former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who has known Taylor for years, said Taylor\u2019s opening statement probably was strategic. \u201cHis testimony knocked my socks off because of the detail,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only surmise that he included so much because he wanted to make sure the policy stayed in the right direction.\u201d\n\nTaylor, a svelte 72-year-old, began developing his expertise in Ukraine in 1992 when he served as the coordinator for U.S. assistance to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In 2006 he was appointed by President George W. Bush to be ambassador to Ukraine, a country he described in his testimony as \u201cimportant to the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s penchant for staying active but below the radar even translated to his love of tennis. While serving as ambassador during the Bush administration, he played a private match against Viktor Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president ousted in the 2014 revolution. Taylor won, according to two people familiar with the competition, but he told close friends not to tell anyone so as not to embarrass the Ukrainian politician.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA former colleague said the incident perfectly captured his essence: This was \u201cso Bill,\u201d she said.\n\nUntil this week, Taylor wasn\u2019t known for taking a scorched-earth approach to bureaucratic politics, but he wasn\u2019t a passive bystander either.\n\nWhen he worked as the coordinator for aid to the Soviet space in the 1990s, Taylor\u2019s colleagues said he was masterful at figuring out ways to keep programs going after they had been targeted for budget cuts.\n\nChris Crowley, who went to Ukraine in 1999 as head of the USAID mission for the former Soviet states, said Taylor would listen to their defense of the program and make the case it should continue. When possible, Crowley said, Taylor looked for other places to make cuts.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe had widespread respect, not only among the USAID people with whom he worked but within the State Department,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cHe was always there, always thoughtful and reasonable in terms of issues and support.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThough former co-workers described Taylor as unflappable and competent, few recalled what he typically did in his free time.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say he\u2019s a workaholic,\u201d said a former senior Foreign Service officer at USAID. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very hard worker. He was at his desk at 6 a.m. and worked till it shut down. In his down time, he was usually on his cell talking to people who could make change happen in the world.\u201d", "description": "Instead of encouraging officials to follow the letter of the law, U.S. diplomats were pressing Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit President Trump politically, diplomat says.", "authors": ["John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department", "Carol Morello", "National Reporter Focusing On Foreign Policy", "State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/hXcAHpJUemJkh5nPbaCBzXrAtd4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EAGMIPHVEQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
