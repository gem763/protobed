said he had asked officers to find a way for those who wanted to protest to be able to do so legally and peacefully.\n\nHe said he had \u201creceived assurances that Extinction Rebellion are not banned from protesting in our city\u201d, adding: \u201cNeither I nor the deputy mayor for policing and crime was informed before the Metropolitan Police took the operational decision to impose a Section 14 order on Extinction Rebellion Autumn Uprising last night. I\u2019ve met with senior officers today to seek further information on why they deemed this necessary.\u201d\n\nActivists nonetheless continued protests in the capital in defiance of the order, targeting the Department for Transport. Gail Bradbrook, the group\u2019s founder, climbed the entrance while other demonstrators glued themselves to the building.\n\nOthers were also arrested after blocking the road outside MI5\u2019s headquarters, while others locked themselves to a caravan parked outside Millbank tower.\n\nPolice officers spent two hours trying to release their arms and eventually did so by using a magnetic drill.\n\nParliament Square was also briefly closed after one protester scaled a pillar on the fence that surrounds the houses of parliament. They were later removed and detained.\n\nIlya Fisher, a fine art photographer from Cornwall, said she was taking part despite never having been arrested before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want other people to say, \u2018Why is such a boring ordinary person doing this?\u2019 and they will look into the climate science,\u201d she said. \u201cThe government isn\u2019t protecting us. If we wait until 2050 for the carbon emissions to be reduced it\u2019s way too late.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion has attracted the support of thousands of young people across the world.\n\nBut opposite Buckingham Palace, a group of grandparents and older activists gathered and launched into song.\n\n\u201cThis nanna is revolting,\u201d one demonstrator\u2019s sign read.\n\nDefending the order, Laurence Taylor, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s deputy assistant commissioner, said: \u201cThis was an operational policing decision to help us get London moving again. After nine days of disruption, we felt it is entirely proportionate and reasonable to impose this condition because of the cumulative impact of these protests.\n\n\u201cA significant policing operation continues and we will take robust action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion.\u201d\n\nThe force said 1,489 people had so far been arrested in connection with the wave of activism.\n\nNinety-two people have been charged with a range of offences, including failing to comply with the Section 14 order, criminal damage and obstruction of a highway.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Thousands of\u00a0Extinction Rebellion activists gathered across London in defiance of a police order banning the group\u2019s climate protests in the capital.
