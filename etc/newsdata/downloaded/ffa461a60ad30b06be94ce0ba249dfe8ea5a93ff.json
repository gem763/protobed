Like this thread he wrote about a major error in the whistleblower memo:\n\nAt least one major part of the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d memo is false AND this also proves one of their White House moles was misinformed or lying too \u201cThe call [with Ukraine] did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective\u201d THREAD \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nA \u201cWhite House official\u201d is quoted by the whistleblower (WB) as objecting to the storage of the MEMCON transcript of @realDonaldTrump call with Zelenskyy in a secure storage system in the NSC. This was wrong (a cover up) because it contained \u201cnothing remotely sensitive\u201d. Nothing! pic.twitter.com/z38G4xkwkq \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nYa\u2019 don\u2019t say?\n\nBut \u2026\n\nThat\u2019s categorically, 100% false. The President\u2019s call with Zelenskyy contained references to both POTUS\u2019s and the Ukrainian President\u2019s opinions on multiple European countries and leaders, especially Germany/France and Merkel/Macron, as well as sanctions policy towards Russia pic.twitter.com/p57jssTRa3 \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nNot just false but categorically, 100% false.\n\nThat\u2019s why when originally classified the transcript was set at the SECRET, Original Classification Authority (ORCON), No Foreign Distribution (NOFORN) level pic.twitter.com/w4QVsQ5owe \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nThat classification was set because the diplomatic view of the United States (and POTUS) towards other countries and leaders can \u201ccause serious damage to national security\u201d if disclosed in an unauthorized way. In this case it could also damage the national security of Ukraine too pic.twitter.com/hnP9hUKDu4 \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nTo prove the point, @Comey was referred to the IG and DOJ for potential prosecution because just *one* of his memos contained a *tiny* amount of similar information: POTUS\u2019s views on the relative importance of two countries (one of which was Russia) and when to return their calls pic.twitter.com/flYTWYc4K7 \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nComey\u2019s content was far milder & only 6 words, but even it was classified at the CONFIDENTIAL level, I.e would cause \u201cdamage to national security\u201d Trump\u2019s transcript was SECRET because it had far more info AND far stronger views about a *key US foreign policy*: Russia sanctions \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nWow.\n\nThe fact Trump has since been forced into disclosing the transcript is irrelevant At the time, a SECRET classification was clearly warranted and the call DID contain sensitive national security information \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nWhich means it was an error or they LIED.\n\nThe WB and their White House official mole were wrong, or lying when they said the transcript \u201cdid not contain anything remotely sensitive\u201d Now, what else is wrong about their complaint and what else are they & their sources lying or misinformed about? /ENDS \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\nWe imagine there\u2019s a whole lot more \u2018wrong\u2019 with this memo.\n\nOh, and almost like a PS \u2026\n\nN.B. the wording of the complaint also suggests the whistleblower was a senior member of or very close colleague of the National Security Council in the White House. But that will be revealed soon enough\u2026 \u2014 Undercover Huber (@JohnWHuber) September 26, 2019\n\n*popcorn*\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2018Your leakers flat-out LIED to you\u2019: Hannity LEVELS Vanity Fair writer who wrote hit-piece claiming Fox News in chaos\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t BEG, it\u2019s a bad look\u2019: Jill Filipovic pleads with Tweeps NOT to cancel their NYT subscription in hilariously pathetic thread\n\nWait a MINUTE: Tweet Adam \u2018Schiffty\u2019 Schiff sent out a MONTH ago looks very, very familiar (hint, whistleblower)", "description": "Man, this whistleblower mess looks worse and worse for the Left.", "authors": ["Sam Janney", "Posted At Am On September", "Sam J."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/epic-fail_new.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
