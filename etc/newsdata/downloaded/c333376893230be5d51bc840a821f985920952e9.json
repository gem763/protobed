The U.S. has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports, driving up costs for businesses, and the two countries recently established a framework for a \"phase one\" deal.\n\nUnder the new regulations, which take effect on Jan. 1, China will \"ensure better protection for trade secrets and never allow forced technology transfer,\" Ning said. \"Further, China will strengthen and speed up improvements made to standards for patents, trademarks, copyright infringement, counterfeiting judgments, inspection and identification.\"\n\nThe law minimizes the direct allocation of government resources to the market and direct government intervention in market activities, and establishes a punitive damages system for intellectual property infringement. China will also deepen trademark registration and patent application reform, among other things.\n\nNing called on the U.S. to do its part. \"The other side should also improve the business environment and provide convenience for Chinese-funded enterprises,\" he said.\n\n\"China\u2019s intellectual property theft is real, damaging, and ending thanks to President Trump\u2019s strong trade actions and his OSTP Director\u2019s focus on ending abuses in our open society\u2019s education and research system,\" an administration official told FOX Business.\n\nThe tentative U.S.-China deal, which has not yet been signed, is said to include China making concessions on intellectual property, financial services and agriculture. In return, the U.S. agreed not to implement new tariffs on Chinese goods on Oct. 15. It is not yet clear if the U.S. will go through with its next round of tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15.\n\nThe two sides are working to complete a written draft for Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping to sign when they are in Chile next month for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\n\nTrump has said a comprehensive trade deal will have two or three phases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nFOX Business' R.N.
