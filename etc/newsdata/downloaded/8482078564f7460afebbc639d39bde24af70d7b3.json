It\u2019s a lot,\u201d the 43-year-old Woods said of his 82nd official Tour victory. His first came 23 years ago this month in Las Vegas when he was just 20.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week, five days at the top of the board is a long time. It was definitely stressful.\u201d\n\nWoods led from gun to tape in the inaugural US PGA Tour event in Japan, which saw Friday\u2019s play washed out by the fringes of a typhoon that dumped almost 10 inches of rain on the course 50 miles (80km) from Tokyo, forcing play into an extra day.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy finished birdie-birdie for a 67 and a share of third place on 13-under par with South Korea\u2019s PGA Tour Rookie of the Year Im Sung-jae who carded a fine five-under 65.\n\nWoods resumed his final round, suspended due to darkness on Sunday, at 7.30 am on the long par-12th at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club but saw his overnight three-shot cushion over Matsuyama immediately cut to two.\n\nThe 15-time major winner missed the green with his approach and fell back to 17-under par as he failed to get up and down.\n\nWoods\u2019s early-morning putter was cold, and on the short 13th he failed to take advantage from six feet for a birdie.\n\nUp ahead on the 14th green, Matsuyama inexplicably spurned an easy opportunity to reduce the deficit to one as he missed a four-foot birdie putt.\n\nWoods was then faced with a similar line of putt as Matsuyama on 14, but from 20 feet further away. He did not miss, and restored his three-shot advantage with four holes remaining.\n\nWoods missed another birdie chance, from 10 feet, at the 15th and was watching from the 16th tee 181 yards away as Matsuyama walked in a 20-footer for his first birdie of the day to get to 16-under.\n\nMatsuyama crushed a drive down the middle of the 491-yard 17th and found the putting surface with his approach.\n\nMatsuyama\u2019s fine attempt to hole the putt slid by on the left and he found sand twice on the par-five 18th as he went in search of an eagle.\n\nMatsuyama\u2019s greenside bunker shot flew the flag and when he missed the long putt back his brave challenge ended at 16-under for the tournament after a final-round 67.\n\n\u201cThis was big,\u201d said a smiling Woods.\n\n\u201cHideki made it tight. It was a lot closer than what people probably thought. Hideki put heat on me.\u201d", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods said it was \u201ccrazy\u201d after he made golfing history Monday by holding off the challenge of home", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/131b2c_tiger-woods-on-his-way-crazy-82nd-pga-tour-win-in-japan-it-crazy-tiger-woods-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
