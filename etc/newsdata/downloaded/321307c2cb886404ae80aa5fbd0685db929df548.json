The report was compiled before Hurricane Dorian struck the Bahamas - the numbers affected by that storm are still unclear.\n\nIDMC estimates that the number of new displacements associated with weather events will reach 22m by the end of the year, more than tripling the current number, and making 2019 one of the worst years for climate displacement since records began.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Only then will we be able to reduce the upheaval, trauma and impoverishment that many millions of people suffer each year, and reverse the trends laid out in this report.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \"Huge damage\" as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

They hope countries will \u201clearn from the past\u201d and begin to implement pre-emptive evacuations and other lifesaving precautions.\n\n\u201cMany of those displaced suffered losses, but they survived and were able to return to their homes once the storm had passed. Cyclone Idai, by contrast, was responsible for more than 416 fatalities in Mozambique and is likely to lead to longer-lasting displacement and other impacts to people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d the report states, referring to a storm that also displaced 617,000 people.\n\n\u201cThis underscores the importance of governments having the information, knowledge and capacity they need to take early action to protect communities and make them more resilient to disasters.\u201d\n\nLast year in the United States, Hurricane Florence was named as the largest factor in displacing people from their homes. Hurricane Michael, and the Woosley and Camp Fires in California also distinctly ranked. All are still being dealt with in their affected areas.", "description": "A record seven million people were displaced by disasters in the first half of 2019, suggesting that mass displacement due to extreme weather events is \u201cbecoming the norm,\u201d according to a new\u00a0report.", "authors": ["Lily Puckett"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/12/19/gettyimages-1167207697.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
