It should have been the other way around; those lucky enough to witness this gripping game owed all the ferociously committed players involved a collective vote of thanks.\n\nRespect is certainly due to the All Blacks for the first-half attacking excellence that, crucially, delivered 14 points inside four minutes just before the half-hour after South Africa had given the defending champions a serious early pounding. Those two converted scores for George Bridge and Scott Barrett were not the only reasons the defending champions ultimately prevailed \u2013 a stunning cover tackle by Richie Mo\u2019unga on the brilliant Cheslin Kolbe was also crucial \u2013 but they undoubtedly tipped the scales.\n\nIt maintained New Zealand\u2019s proud record of never having lost a Rugby World Cup pool game and throws down the gauntlet to every other hopeful team in the tournament. The abiding lesson of Super Saturday \u2013 and what a splendid triple bill of rugby it was \u2013 is that it will take something extra special from a third party to prevent both these nations from returning to this same stadium for the final on 2 November.\n\nNew Zealand 23-13 South Africa: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 live reaction! Read more\n\nThe result, among other things, increases the probability of England facing the All Blacks in the semi-finals should they finish top of Pool C, while the Boks and Ireland could clash in the quarter-finals if Joe Schmidt\u2019s men prevail in Pool A. Every side in the competition, either way, will have noted New Zealand\u2019s problem-solving ability, their remarkable discipline \u2013 they conceded two penalties to South Africa\u2019s 11 \u2013 and their lethal ability to capitalise on loose kicks which fall anywhere within range of Beauden Barrett or his wings.\n\nIf the quicksilver Kolbe would surely have been man of the match had he finished what would have been one of the great solo World Cup tries, it was ultimately Barrett\u2019s pace, positioning and running lines from full-back which helped the All Blacks sidestep onrushing trouble. The debate over the 28-year-old\u2019s best position is a red herring which becomes wholly irrelevant when he fizzes like this. Ardie Savea was also a serious ball of energy while Kieran Read\u2019s calm captaincy was another influential positive.\n\nPlay Video 0:33 Rugby World Cup: Key moments as New Zealand, France and Australia win \u2013 video highlights\n\nThe defending champions, chasing a third world crown title in succession, had to weather some prolonged periods of pressure, not least in the first quarter when South Africa\u2019s rush defence caused real problems. Had Handre Pollard not crashed a straightforward penalty against a post the Boks would have led 6-0 with a kick-off reception to come but, instead, it was the catalyst for the game\u2019s decisive period. Mo\u2019unga\u2019s deft cross-kick in his own 22 freed up the lively Seru Reece to make good ground and launch a flowing upfield move which ended with Beauden Barrett offloading out of a tackle by Eben Etzebeth to the supporting George Bridge. Inside four minutes New Zealand had a second long-range try on the board, Dane Coles putting Anton Lienert-Brown through a hole before the untouched Scott Barrett strode 25 metres to the line.\n\nNew Zealanders vent anger at being unable to watch Rugby World Cup Read more\n\nThe last time New Zealand lost a game when leading by seven points or more at half-time, remarkably, was against France in the quarter-final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. They have never been reeled in when presented with a lead of more than 12 points, which left South Africa facing a Mount Fuji-sized challenge.\n\nThey gave it a proper crack. Kolbe\u2019s magical run down the right touchline was stopped at the last by Mo\u2019unga \u2013 \u201cIt was a match-winner or close to it,\u201d confirmed his grateful head coach, Steve Hansen \u2013 before Pieter-Steph du Toit spotted a gap at the side of a ruck and dived over for a converted score to reduce the margin to 17-10. Duane Vermeulen, playing his 50th Test, and Faf De Klerk then combined to create a thrilling charge straight through the heart of the All Black defence, with South Africa denied another score only by a crucial close-range turnover.\n\nA coolly-taken Pollard drop goal cut the gap to 17-13 just before the hour, ensuring a taut final quarter. South Africa might conceivably have sneaked it but, then again, New Zealand also came close to a third converted score. \u201cMost of their tries came from turnovers and bad kicks but New Zealand deserved to win,\u201d acknowledged the Springbok coach, Rassie Erasmus, suggesting the All Blacks were still clear tournament favourites. \u201cThey\u2019re a team who know how to ramp up the pressure the minute they\u2019re ahead on the scoreboard.\u201d The margins remain slim but outwitting the All Blacks mentally and tactically for 80 minutes is as tough as ever.", "description": "After spending the opening 20 minutes under the cosh and despite a second-half South Africa come back, New Zealand won 23-13 with tries from George Bridge and Scott Barrett", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b39310d3e812bea611c1b4501363f4c99d4591/146_100_4056_2433/master/4056.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=adaf570db47c19128ba1042a3743887c", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
