She passed a breath test. She was held overnight at our police station in Palma and will be handed over to the judiciary for a court quiz later today.\u201c\n\nThe issue of how fast she was going is something that is still being looked at and will be the subject of expert tests.\u201c\n\nShe was interviewed last night but was not in a fit state to be questioned at length so the question of why she ended up on the pavement is something that the investigating judge will be looking at.\u201d", "description": "The Brit is fighting for his life and a German woman died in the crash on the Paseo Maritimo in Palma on Friday afternoon", "authors": ["Rita Sobot", "Milo Boyd", "Gerard Couzens"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20651365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Mallorca_17510JPGed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
