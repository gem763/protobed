(AP) - Parents who say their son was improperly restrained at a children\u2019s hospital and school have taken their case to the South Dakota Supreme Court.\n\nNeil and Deb Graff are suing Children\u2019s Care Hospital and School on behalf of their autistic son over its use of the prone restraint at the institution in 2010. The restraint involves bringing a person to the floor face-down and holding that person\u2019s arms and legs. The Graff\u2019s 2013 lawsuit says the restraint was used on Ben more than 130 times while he was a resident. The Argus Leader says it\u2019s now prohibited under administrative rules.\n\nThe Graff\u2019s attorney Michael Luce says a judge improperly excluded state Department of Health surveys which would have showed deficiencies in Ben\u2019s care. There\u2019s no timeline on when the Supreme Court will decide the case.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Argus Leader, http://www.argusleader.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Parents who say their son was improperly restrained at a children's hospital and school have taken their case to the South Dakota Supreme Court.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
