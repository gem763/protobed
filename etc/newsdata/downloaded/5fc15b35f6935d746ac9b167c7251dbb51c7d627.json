At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBay\u2019s managed payments experience for our customers.\u201d", "description": "Five payments companies led by eBay, Mastercard  and Visa have abruptly dropped out of Facebook's project to create a new digital currency, Libra, dealing a major blow to the social network's plan.", "authors": ["Laurence Dodds", "Us Technology Reporter", "Ben Marlow", "Mason Boycott-Owen", "Tom Hoggins"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/08/Libra1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgCXocDQF5kP7s3jSjli3eHnk4Br5GiVFovEsrgivlFU.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
