In the past, it has been a reliable indicator of depressed economic conditions. Many Fed officials think it remains a good signal.\n\nSee also: 5 things investors need to know about an inverted yield curve\n\nIn a speech at The Leo J. Meehan School of Business at Stonehill College, Rosengren said he was giving less credence to the inverted yield curve this year because it was the long end of the curve that was moving lower. Long-term rates are controlled by the market, he said.\n\nIn years past, it has been short-term end of the curve, where rates are controlled by the Fed, that has inverted, as rates get pushed higher by the central bank worried about inflation in a strong economy.\n\nThe Boston Fed president said he thought it was \u201cplausible\u201d that the depressed 10-year Treasury rate this year is due more to weakness among U.S. trading partners than fears about the domestic U.S. economy.\n\nHe also noted that stocks remain robust despite the rocky summer.\n\n\u201cRecession concerns do not seem to be reflected in the current pricing of stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nMarkets were also reacting to significant risks from trade tensions, he said.\n\nRosengren didn\u2019t address the ISM August manufacturing survey, which showed a contraction in activity for the first time in three years.\n\nRead: ISM manufacturing index falls below 50, signals contraction\n\nThe Boston Fed president said he still expected 2% growth over the rest of the year, but was watching things closely.\n\n\u201cIn my view, one should not be overconfidence that the economy will be just fine or that an economic downturn is inevitable,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\nThe Boston Fed president suggested he would not support another rate cut in September unless it was clear the economy was softening.\n\n\u201cIf the data continue to indicate a U.S. economy growing slightly above the level considered to be the potential growth rate with continued gradual increases in wages and prices, then in my view, no immediate policy action would be required,\u201d he said.\n\nFinancial markets were volatile on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.08% falling 285 points or 1% to 26,118.\n\nThe Fed is split into two camps on interest-rate policy. Many want to see more easing.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a leading dove, told Reuters on Tuesday he wants to see a half point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17-18 policy meeting.", "description": "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren says \u201cheadline grabbing\u201d market moves this summer obscure the fact that U.S. economic conditions remain \u201crelatively benign.\u201d", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ591_roseng_ZG_20190903150238.jpg"}
