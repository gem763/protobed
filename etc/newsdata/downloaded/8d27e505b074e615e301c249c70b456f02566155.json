It is not clear whether delays to Brexit and doubt over when any election would take place expedited his decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLord Mann told the Yorkshire Press however that the current political turmoil had \u2018paralysed\u2019 parliament.\n\nHe added: \u2018The power of the Prime Minister, Speaker and the whips will all need to be reconsidered if our democracy is to properly function. I am not holding my breath at such maturity.\u2019\n\nVoters in the Bassetlaw sided nearly two to one in favour of leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum. If a bye-election is called it would provide a considerable litmus test for Boris Johnson\u2019s government and Brexit strategy.\n\nLord Mann, who has previously called for the House of Lords to be abolished, was nominated in Theresa May\u2019s resignation honour\u2019s list.\n\nHe was one of 19 Labour MPs who voted for Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit bill at second reading in parliament last week.\n\nLord Mann\u2019s office has been contacted for comment.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
