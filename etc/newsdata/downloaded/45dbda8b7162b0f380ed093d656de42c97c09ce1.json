Big names pledge $17 million toward new videogame network", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 A new venture backed by many of videogaming\u2019s biggest publishers is unveiling a network that hopes to be to esports what ESPN has been to traditional sports.\n\nVENN is set to launch in 2020 and aims to give the fragmented esports scene a home base for content with higher production value than gamers are used to with online streaming. The network was co-founded by four-time Emmy-winning producer Ariel Horn and entrepreneur Ben Kusin and has raised $17 million from investors including co-founders from Twitch, Riot Games and Blizzard Entertainment.\n\nVENN, short for Video Game Entertainment and News Network, will debut with live studios in New York and Los Angeles. There is expected to be 55 hours of original programming per week, including gamer streams, talk shows, documentaries and live esport events. It already has deals in place to broadcast on Microsoft\u2019s MSFT, +0.78% Twitch and YouTube, a unit of Alphabet\u2019s GOOGL, -0.14% GOOG, -0.17% Google, and expects to be available on mediums like Roku ROKU, +0.66% or Dish Network\u2019s DISH, -2.16% Sling.\n\nEsports revenues are expected to top $1 billion this year, and global viewership numbers are rivaling those of traditional sports \u2014 nearly 100 million viewers watched last year\u2019s League of Legends world championship, roughly on par with TV viewership for the Super Bowl.\n\nYet the industry remains disjointed. Just like not all football fans also watch hockey, \u201cFortnite\u201d players aren\u2019t necessarily keeping tabs on \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d or \u201cOverwatch.\u201d Creating a common space for all those gamers has proven difficult. Perhaps the closest thing is the online streaming platform Twitch, but gamers there tend to find streams specific to their interest, creating little overlap with other gaming domains.\n\nVENN hopes to solve that with content built around the culture of gaming.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re more of a hybridized ESPN and what MTV TRL (Total Request Live) was when it launched decades ago,\u201d Kusin said. \u201cThat crossover that it brought music in that generation in the culture.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lofty pitch, but one that\u2019s proven credible to many of gaming\u2019s most influential names. The group\u2019s initial investors include Riot Games co-founder Marc Merrill, Blizzard Entertainment co-founder Mike Morhaime, Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin and aXiomatic Gaming, an investment group behind Team Liquid and Epic Games. That gives VENN financial connections to esports\u2019 biggest titles \u2014 Tencent\u2019s 700, -0.87% Riot owns \u201cLeague of Legends,\u201d Activision Blizzard ATVI, -0.77% is behind \u201cOverwatch\u201d and \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d and Epic publishes \u201cFortnite\u201d \u2014 as well as some of its biggest teams.\n\n\u201cWe could go to these luminaries in the industry and say, \u2018Hey, we want to come together, be swift, work with a bunch of different titles, a bunch of different publishers and move the industry forward in terms of its recognition and prominence, will you help us?\u2019\u201d Kusin said. \u201cThe answer was a resounding yes.\u201d\n\nHorn\u2019s presence is a big part of that. Formerly a sports producer at NBC, he has become a pioneering figure in esports. His achievements included a sports Emmy in 2017 for his role in landing an augmented reality dragon inside a stadium during the 2017 \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d World Championships opening ceremony and a successful New Year\u2019s Eve stream by Ninja from Times Square last year.\n\n\u201cTaking what\u2019s already there on a platform that (gamers) understand, and taking that into a network environment, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do,\u201d Horn said.", "description": "A new venture backed by many of videogaming\u2019s biggest publishers is unveiling a network that hopes to be to esports what ESPN has been to traditional sports.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR484_esport_ZG_20190917175217.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
