The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry say some benefits are: Staying connected to friends\n\nMeeting new friends with shared interests\n\nFinding community and support for specific activities\n\nSharing art work or music\n\nExploring and expressing themselves\n\nFarshad Shadloo, a spokesperson for YouTube, doubled down on the company's terms of use.\n\n'YouTube is not a site for people under 13.'\n\nIt's unsurprising that young Americans are also consumed by smart phones, but the age at which they're getting their first phone is shocking.\n\nAbout one in five kids received their first handset at age eight.\n\nBy age 11, 53 percent of children have a phone and more than two-thirds have a device by age 12.\n\nRobb said: 'That's eye-opening. That's a lot of responsibility for a little kid.'\n\nThe responsibility also falls on the parents.\n\n'It puts a lot of pressure on a parent to figure out what they can reasonably filter,' Robb said.\n\nOnly 23 percent of children say tweens say they watch YouTube Kids, a streaming service dedicated to users under 13, despite the regular YouTube app having an age restriction\n\nSarah Domoff, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Central Michigan University studies technology's impact on families and children.\n\nShe thinks parents are overwhelmed.\n\n'It's really hard to block out certain things unless you're really standing over your child,' she said.\n\nThis is especially true in an era where many devices are handheld and portable.\n\nDomoff said some parents could do more in terms of tracking screen time, but service filters on platforms like YouTube also aren't sufficient.\n\nCritics are wary of how much YouTube will actually do to curb children's app usage when the site flourishes on users going down 'rabbit holes' of content.\n\nRobb said: 'If your model is built on maintaining attention, it's really hard to do something.'\n\nHe suggests families combat screen time in a variety of ways.\n\n'Protect homework time, family time, dinner time and bed time. Have device-free times or zones.'\n\nDomoff said: 'There needs to be a game plan.", "description": "Common Sense Media conducted a survey that found that young American  have doubled the amount of time they spend watching online videos and that YouTube is the platform of choice", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/18/20340658-0-image-a-42_1572372544913.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
