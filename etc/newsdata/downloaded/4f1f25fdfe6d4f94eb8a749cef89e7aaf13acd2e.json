But I'm careful to make the distinction of when I'm at school and when I'm here,\" she told CBS News, remarking that \"this is what I do in my spare time.\"\n\nAsked what she perceived as her brother's biggest challenge, Biden Owens swiped back at some of the debate stage attacks on her brother.\n\n\"Joe wants to win this primary and win the presidency on the basis of his vision, and moving forward, and what his plans are,\" Biden Owens explained. \"I don't think there are a lot of people who want to go back and re-litigate section 453 of some bill. His biggest challenge is not to be pulled back in by that. Not to be pulled in by somebody who wants a t-shirt opportunity.\"\n\nBefore headlining an office opening in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Biden Owens stopped Monday morning at Nevada non-profit SafeNest, where she toured one of the charity's facilities for victims of domestic violence.\n\n\"I know we Bidens are accused of talking a lot and I've already done that,\" she joked at a roundtable with community advocates, discussing then-Sen. Biden's landmark Violence Against Women Act.\n\n\"But we're good listeners too. Tell us what you need. My brother will be here himself in two weeks, but I'm a good messenger,\" she added.\n\nBiden has deployed a handful of surrogates to Nevada in recent weeks, including an Olympic figure skater and a former Obama labor secretary, as more campaigns have begun to ramp up their own presence in the state.\n\nMinutes away from Biden's new office, Pete Buttigieg's campaign manager Mike Schmuhl also Monday was inaugurating their third location in the state. Schmuhl pledged \"to get Pete here more and more\" as the South Bend mayor looks to catch up to Nevada's heavyweights: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden.\n\n\"To go from five volunteers in January to the strength that we have now, we're over 400 staff across the early states and we're only going to get stronger,\" said Schmuhl.", "description": "\"I don't think you'd call for impeachment proceedings because of a story in The New York Times,\" Valerie Biden Owens, a campaign co-chair, said", "authors": ["Alexander Tin"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/28/f2ee0295-c2a6-4a0b-8ef8-30929d2fa68d/thumbnail/1200x630/14d1092db8e470011cb00b65103dea55/8-kavanaugh-gettyimages-1047770162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
