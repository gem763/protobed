We have been here before. Why are we back?\n\n\u201cThis is what climate change looks like\u201d tweeted liberal Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez sharing images of a burning state and showing support for her Green New Deal, the vegan-mandating, airplane-eliminating, hundred trillion dollar regressive proposal.\n\nClimate change is the cause, and legislation, putting government in charge of everything, is the answer.\n\nTOM DEL BECCARO: CALIFORNIA, PG&E, WE CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS. HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND\n\nFor a liberal government is always the answer.\n\nClimate change is the perfect villain. It is nameless, faceless, and most of all, it is everywhere.\n\nAt first the evils of climate change were relegated to the climate meaning blistering heat. But then, so too is the polar vortex blamed on climate change. As is too much snow or a lack of snow.\n\nOne radical green group The National Resources Defense Council has attributed both droughts and floods to climate change which conveniently covers all bases.\n\nOver time every phenomena in nature from hurricanes to tornados to typhoons to earthquakes were caused or exacerbated by climate change. This was intentional: show how climate change was the problem and thus grow support for the government solution.\n\nBut why stop at nature? What if we can show that climate change is the \u201creal\u201d cause of illegal immigration and also the need for greater government-run health care? What if climate change contributes to racism, and misogyny?\n\nWant more?\n\nClimate change, according to President Obama, was our greatest national security threat and was responsible for much of America\u2019s crumbling infrastructure. The publications \u201cScientific American\u201d presumably \u201cscholarly\u201d and \u201cacademic\u201d, has articles saying it will hurt both rural areas and urban areas the most which you would think violates Aristotle\u2019s foundational law of non-contradiction, but who needs foundational laws when there\u2019s so much politics to do\u2026\n\nAdd to that ever-growing list California\u2019s fires. Because this is certain: climate change is the cause, and government is the solution. And that is very, very convenient for elected officials.\n\nIt matters little that the governor is \u201ccommitted to addressing climate change\u201d when he\u2019s not committed to preventing forest fires.\n\nIf a mayor or a governor, or even the president, can blame everything on the ethereal and yet omnipotent \u201cclimate change\u201d he can quite literally wash his hands of responsibility and justify both lethargy and incompetence. Sure, an administrator could take steps to mitigate California\u2019s fires, but climate change is different. In the months where California was fire-free (roughly mid-December 2018 and mid-May 2019) what did the state do to prevent fires? Nothing. Why? Climate change.\n\nThere are a few man-made reasons why California seems to be constantly burning.\n\nFirst off: it is dry. Not from climate change but from poor water management. Earlier this year the Sierra Nevada snowpack was 202 percent above the average (probably caused by climate change) with ski slopes operating into July. Where did the melt go? It is diverted, and California\u2019s waterways do not run naturally. So much so that a proposal was introduced in 2010 to allow at least 60 percent of the rivers to flow unencumbered. Last year that was reduced to 40 percent, and the policy has still not been implemented. California doesn\u2019t lack water; it lacks flowing water.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s forest are ignored, a claim President Trump made with which even Californians agree on. Decades of \u201cgreen\u201d policies protecting trees and wildlife, good intentions aside, created a tinder box of dead wood and overgrown brush. n some areas, locals are hoping the timber industry can prevent further fires. The private sector to the rescue, yet again.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nPrevention goes a long way, and California does have resources. It\u2019s cap-and-trade program, albeit bad economics, annually generates $11 billion with an entire bureaucracy appropriating it to \u201cgreen\u201d investments. The program has spent over $1 billion in grants for electric cars. Since 2001 it has given over $100 billion in green technology subsidies. Nothing for fire preventing or mitigation strategies.\n\nIn a recent press conference, California\u2019s Governor Newsom said \u201cCalifornians are bearing the brunt of these wildfires\u201d and he\u2019s absolutely right. Neither southern Oregon nor Western Nevada seem to suffer the same pinpointed effects of global climate change as California, which further demonstrates its wounds are largely self-inflicted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCould climate change be the reason for excessive winds and dry weather? Of course. But when does a governor start governing? When does a leader start leading? It matters little that the governor is \u201ccommitted to addressing climate change\u201d when he\u2019s not committed to preventing forest fires.\n\n\u201cThis is what climate change looks like\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted with the hashtag \u201c#GreenNewDeal\u201d. But she is wrong on both counts. What\u2019s happening in California is what government incompetence and dereliction of duty looks like. And big government is not the solution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DANIEL TURNER", "description": "Once again California is burning.\u00a0We have been here before.
