REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser/Files\n\nSpot gold fell 0.2% to $1,514.44 per ounce at 0546 GMT, but lingered near the over one-week high of $1,516.81 hit on Friday.\n\nU.S. gold futures were up 0.5% to $1,521.90 per ounce.\n\n\u201cGold is currently in a mixed zone.\u201d said Howie Lee, economist at OCBC Bank.\n\n\u201cThe pickup in geopolitical risk from Saudi Arabia and President Trump rejecting the possibility of a partial trade deal with China certainly adds that little more shine to gold.\u201d\n\nA U.S.-China trade breakthrough seemed unlikely after President Donald Trump told reporters on Friday he was \u201cnot looking\u201d for a partial deal, and Chinese officials cancelled goodwill visits to U.S. farmers.\n\nBut both sides later published positive statements, with the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office describing the last week\u2019s talks as \u201cproductive\u201d and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry calling them \u201cconstructive.\u201d October\u2019s high-level talks remain on track.\n\nMeanwhile in the Middle East, tensions remained elevated with the Pentagon ordering additional troops to be deployed in the Gulf region to strengthen Saudi Arabia\u2019s air and missile defences, following an attack on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities. U.S. has slapped more sanctions on Iran, penalising the Iranian Central Bank.\n\nSaudi Arabia will also seek to make a case at a global gathering in New York this week for concerted action to punish and deter Iran after the strikes.\n\n\u201cThe safe heaven status is still supporting gold. But the prices are stuck between $1,480 and $1,580,\u201d said OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley.\n\nThe dollar was nearly flat against a basket of currencies, while most Asian share markets slipped on Monday.\n\nIndicative of investor interest in gold, holdings at SPDR Gold Trust, the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 1.19% to 894.15 tonnes on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, COMEX gold speculators raise net long position by 14,150 contracts to 261,878 in week to Sept. 17, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nSpot palladium rose about 1% to $1,656.77 per ounce, after hitting a record high at $1,659.27 earlier in the session.\n\nSilver rose 1.6 % to $18.26 per ounce and platinum rose nearly 1% to $953.70 per ounce.", "description": "Gold prices inched lower on Monday as investors sought more clarity on U.S.-China trade talks, while escalating tensions in the Middle East provided some support.", "authors": ["Diptendu Lahiri", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432849096&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0C2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
