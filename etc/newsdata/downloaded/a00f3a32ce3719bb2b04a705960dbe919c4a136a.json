The New York Times first revealed the existence of this \u201cloose network\u201d of conservatives who were combing through the Twitter feeds of journalists from prominent outlets (including the Times). On Monday, Axios reported that its backers were aiming to raise $2 million for the project, whose mission would be to \u201c[target] the people producing the news\u201d and presumably discredit the organizations that employ them.\n\nTheir efforts have received quite a bit of attention\u2014with a number of people gravely tweeting that this was yet another sign of the president\u2019s authoritarianism. Given the president\u2019s own rhetoric about the media being the \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d it\u2019s not hard to imagine how \u201ctargeting the people producing the news\u201d could put journalists in danger. But what\u2019s more likely to happen is that these Republican operatives will simply collect a couple million dollars from donors while promising to do real reporting and then turn their project into yet another hacky right-wing clickbait farm, something that has happened again and again over the past decade. Along the way, the project may expose the occasional bad tweet. But what it\u2019s more likely to expose is the paltriness of right-wing journalism.\n\n\n\nThe project\u2019s maiden foray into policing the press has not sufficiently proven that it\u2019s earned all of this attention. Earlier this month, the nascent cabal made a stink over a couple of anti-Semitic tweets written by a New York Times political editor when he was in college; that editor has since deleted them and apologized. Steve Bannon ally Arthur Schwartz, one of the leaders of the project, has pointed out that other members of the media have written ugly and stupid things online before, which is understandable given that members of the media are human beings and thus prone to doing ugly and stupid things from time to time.\n\n\n\nPeople with knowledge of the operation told The New York Times \u201cit has compiled dossiers of potentially embarrassing social media posts and other public statements by hundreds of people who work at some of the country\u2019s most prominent news organizations.\u201d If true, it\u2019s puzzling that they kicked things off by targeting a Times editor of little renown, instead of staking their claim with a big-name takedown.\n\n", "description": "A new effort to \"target\" journalists has earned its conservative founders $2 million in seed money, which is probably why it exists in the first place.", "authors": ["Alex Shephard"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/58146287dc131f5e5778e61cac06250b2572a4bd.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
