During my 20\u2019s I did not enjoy myself, I was not a happy person and with who I was.\n\n\"I felt I have missed out on a lot of opportunities after having to leave theatre school and I wrote myself off and didn\u2019t have the self-belief.\"\n\n(Image: Credit: Lia Toby/WENN)\n\nJess has taken her life by the scruff of the neck and as she embraces her 30's, she has a new outlook.\n\nShe continued: \"Now I have got older, I have realised that you cannot expect others to believe in you if you cannot believe in yourself.\"\n\nThe Seven premieres on Friday, October 25 and Jess stars alongside Gary Webster, Dean Cain and Amar Adatia.\n\nThere are also cameo appearances by Sinitta and YouTube star Amber 'Doig' Thorne.\n\nThe movie has been released in time for Halloween and will be available on Sky Store, Amazon and iTunes.\n\nIt will also be available on Netflix later next year.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
