The seeds and eggs are kept in a 'lunar mini biosphere'\n\nResearchers hope the potato and arabidopsis seeds will grow to blossom on the moon in 100 days, with the process captured on camera and transmitted to Earth, according to a previous report from Huanqiu.com citing Xinhua News Agency.\n\nThe silkworm eggs are also expected to hatch into larvae before growing into silkworm moths.\n\nThe 6.6lb (three kg) tin is made from a specially developed aluminium alloy. It is seven inches (18 cm) tall, with a diameter of six inches (16 cm) and a net volume of 1.4 pints (0.8 litres).\n\nAs well as seeds, it contains water, a nutrient solution, air and equipment including a small camera and data transmission system.\n\nThe 0.8L cylindrical tin was designed by experts from south-west China's Chongqing University. It is equipped with insulating layers and a mini air-conditioning system\n\nOuyang Ziyuan (pictured), a chief space scientist, said last month the 'lunar mini biosphere' was an experiment to satisfy humans' curiosity of space and its results would be hard to tell\n\nAstronauts have previously cultivated plants on the International Space Station. Rice and arabidopsis were also grown on China's Tiangong-2 space lab.\n\nBoth of these experiments were conducted in low Earth orbit and under very different conditions.\n\nSpeaking to Xinhua last year, the chief designer of the 'lunar mini biosphere' Xie Gengxin called the experiment 'significant'. Xie said it could herald a breakthrough for them to understand how humans might be able to survive on an alien planet.\n\nZhang Yuanxun, a director from China's Deep-space Exploration Associated Research Centre, said the difficulties of the experiment was to control the temperatures and ensure energy supply for the 'lunar mini biosphere' in the 'complicated' environment on the moon.\n\nA Chinese rover is making its tracks on the soft surface of the 'dark' side of the moon after touching down on our nearest celestial neighbour. The Yutu-2 - or Jade Rabbit 2 - rover drove off its lander's ramp and onto the snow-like exterior of the moon at 10:22pm local time\n\nA never-before-seen 'close range' image taken by the Chinese spacecraft Chang'e-4 of the surface of the far side of the moon. It appears to take on a reddish hue in some of the images released by China, an effect of the lights used by the probe\n\nThe lunar day and night each lasts for 14 days, half of its orbit around Earth. The temperatures on its surface could range from the peak of 127\u00b0C (261\u00b0F) to lows of -173\u00b0C (-279\u00b0F).\n\nTo control the temperatures, scientists put insulating layers around the tin and built a mini air-conditioning system inside hoping it could provide a pleasant environment for the plants to grow.\n\nTo obtain energy, the tin will be powered by the solar panels on Chang'e 4 during the day and its internal batteries during the night.\n\nResearchers from 28 Chinese universities are behind the project, led by southwest China's Chongqing University.\n\nThe Lunar explorer touched down at 10.26am local time (2.26am GMT). While stationed on the moon, Chang'e-4 will attempt to recce the Von in the Aitken basin, the largest impact crater in the entire solar system at eight miles (13km) deep and 1,600 miles (2,500km) in diameter\n\nThis picture of Yutu-2 was taken from the lander as the rover was being released. It shows a close-up of one of Yutu-2's wheels\n\nPhotographs taken from the Chang'e-4 probe during its landing process, as it became the first rover to ever reach the surface of the dark side of the moon\n\nOuyang Ziyuan, a chief scientist of China's lunar-exploration programmes, remains humble. He told Chinese news outlet The Cover last month the 'lunar mini biosphere' was an experiment to satisfy humans' curiosity of space and its results would be hard to tell.\n\nBut the leading cosmochemist, dubbed 'the father of Chang'e', also said that the launch of Chang'e 4 was only the start of China's ambitious space missions.\n\nAt a talk in May, Ouyang said China planned to send Chang'e 5 onto the moon in 2019 to dig into the surface and bring geological samples back to Earth.\n\nHe also confirmed China's plan to land on Mars in 2020, build a lunar base called 'Lunar Palace' on the moon and send astronauts onto our nearest celestial neighbour.\n\nWHY IS THE FAR SIDE OF THE MOON KNOWN AS THE 'DARK SIDE'? The far side of the moon - colloquially known as the dark side - actually gets as much light as the near side but always faces away from Earth. Less than a fifth of the opposite half of the moon is ever visible and it wasn't until 1959 until we received images of what it looked like when the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft returned snapped the mysterious region. In 1968, astronauts aboard the Apollo 8 spacecraft were the first humans to set eyes on the far side in person as they orbited the moon. Since then, several missions by NASA and other space agencies have imaged the lunar far side. That includes NASA\u2019s Deep Impact spacecraft, which imaged the far side from a distance of 31 million miles (49m km) in 2008. This relatively unexplored region is mountainous and rugged, making a successful landing much harder to achieve. Professor of astrophysics at the University of Nottingham, Christopher Conselice, said the far side is much more rugged and has less volcanic activity than the side we see from Earth.\n\nChang'e-4 has been described as 'hugely ambitious' and heralded as a sign of China's growing intentions to rival the space exploration prowess of the US, Russia and the EU.\n\nIt touched down in the Aitken basin's Von Karman crater on the far side or dark side of the moon at 10.26am local time (2.26am GMT) yesterday. It transmitted back to Earth a never-before-seen image of the unexplored surface.\n\nThis is the first time on human history that a spacecraft has landed on the other side of the moon.\n\nA moon rover, the Yutu-2 - or Jade Rabbit 2 - drove off the ramp of Chang'e 4 onto the snow-like exterior of the moon's far side at 10:22pm local time (2:22pm GMT).\n\nA photo posted online by China's space agency showed tracks the rover left as it headed away from the spacecraft.\n\nJade Rabbit 2, which weighs 308lbs (139kg) has six individually powered wheels so it can continue to operate even if one wheel fails.\n\nIt can climb a 20-degree hill or an obstacle up to eight inches (20cm) tall and its maximum speed is 220 yards (200 metres) per hour.\n\nIt is 1.5 metres (five feet) long and about one metre (3.3 feet) wide and tall, with two foldable solar panels and six wheels.\n\nThe rover and its accompanying lander will carry out mineral, biological and radiation tests ahead of a future base that China hopes to build on the moon.\n\nThe results of these experiments could lead to new understandings of the challenges faced by settlers who may one day colonise our natural satellite.", "description": "China's Chang'e 4 spacecraft has brought vegetable seeds and silkworm eggs in a small tin to the moon.
