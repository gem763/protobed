Frances, author of the fittingly titled \u201cTwilight of American Sanity,\u201d would later clarify by tweeting that he was talking about the \u201c[t]errible damage Trump is doing to world climate at this global warming tipping point may be irreversable/could kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s quite the bold statement, considering the hefty death toll the Big Three extracted. But, really, it isn\u2019t that shocking to hear. Frances\u2019 pseudohistoric twaddle comports well with the pseudoscientific twaddle that\u2019s been normalized in political discourse. Every year Democrats ratchet up the doomsday scenarios, so we should expect related political rhetoric to become correspondingly unhinged.\n\nAll of this is a manifestation of 50 years of scaremongering on climate change. Paul Ehrlich famously promised that \u201chundreds of millions of people\u201d would \u201cstarve to death,\u201d while in the real world we saw hunger precipitously drop, and the world become increasingly cleaner. Yet, neo-Malthusians keep coming back with fresh iterations of the same hysteria, ignoring mankind\u2019s ability to adapt.\n\nAt a 2005 London conference of \u201cconcerned climate scientists and politicians\u201d that helped launch contemporary climate rhetoric, attendees warned that the world had as little as 10 years before the Earth reached \u201cthe point of no return on global warming.\u201d Humans, they claimed, would soon be grappling with \u201cwidespread agricultural failure,\u201d \u201cmajor droughts,\u201d \u201cincreased disease,\u201d \u201cthe death of forests,\u201d and the \u201cswitching-off of the North Atlantic Gulf Stream,\u201d among many other calamities.\n\nSince then, the Earth has gotten greener. This year, for the first time since we began logging data in 2000, there were no \u201cextreme\u201d or \u201cexceptional\u201d droughts across the contiguous United States\u2014although we\u2019ve come close to zero on numerous occasions over the past decade. Every time there\u2019s a drought anywhere in the world, climate change will be blamed. But world crop yields continue to ensure that fewer people are hungry than ever. I\u2019m not a scientist, but I assume the North Atlantic Gulf Stream is still with us.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. Four years after the last point of no return was reached, the noted naturalist David Attenborough warned the world at a United Nations climate change summit that \u201ccollapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.\u201d\n\nClimate change is always an extinction-level event. When the Democratic National Committee rejected counterproductive single-issue debates this week (climate change being the most notable), a member complained, \u201cIf an asteroid was coming to Earth, there would be no question about having a debate about it, but with this existential crisis facing the world, we all sit and wring our hands.\u201d This is how a lot of Democrats speak. They are never challenged.\n\nAnd if you truly believe a slight variation in climate is comparable to an asteroid barreling towards the Earth\u2014and if we trust their rhetoric, every Democrat presidential candidate does\u2014why wouldn\u2019t you support the authoritarian policy proposals of the Green New Deal?\n\nAnd why wouldn\u2019t you accuse those who oppose more solar panel subsidies and tax hikes of being mass murderers? Why wouldn\u2019t you celebrate the death of philanthropists like David Koch? These people are literally \u201cspinning us all toward environmental doom.\u201d\n\nOn climate change, you can say virtually anything, and no one will challenge your zealotry.\n\nRecently I noticed that CNN, where Frances accused the president of being the worst mass murderer in history without any pushback, refers to \u201cclimate change\u201d as the \u201cclimate crisis\u201d in news stories\u2014which is editorializing, not reporting.\n\nIf journalists did their jobs, they would contest some of the assumptions and exaggerations that have now congealed as \u201ccrisis\u201d in their newsrooms. Not necessarily the science, but the predictive abilities of scientists or the hyperbolic statements of politicians. But how can any reporter be skeptical of anyone when news organizations have already conceded that what they\u2019re covering is a \u201ccrisis?\u201d It would be an apostasy. Chuck Todd won\u2019t give any airtime to \u201cdeniers,\u201d but he\u2019ll open his show any Chicken Little who can get elected.\n\nNot long ago, candidates and mainstream media outlets like CNN were acting as if floods in the Midwest were an unprecedented environmental disaster. In reality, deaths from extreme weather have dropped somewhere around 99.9 percent since the 1920s. Tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and extreme temperatures can still be killers, but thanks to increasingly affordable fossil-fueled heating and air-conditioning systems, safer buildings, and better warning systems\u2014among other technological advances\u2014the vast majority of Americans will never have to fear weather in any genuine way.\n\nPut it this way: Since 1980, death caused by all natural disasters and heat and cold is well under 0.5 percent of the total.\n\nYet, never, to my recollection, has a mainstream reporter asked an environmental activist why, if the world is headed towards Armageddon, humans are better off now than they were 50 years ago, or 20 years ago or 10 years ago? Climate change is supposedly in full swing, yet fewer people are hungry, fewer people are displaced, and we have to fight fewer wars over resources. Extreme poverty has steeply dropped over the past 30 years. There is no evidence that this trajectory is about to change.\n\nWorse, instead of conveying this good news, the media keeps cherrypicking problems without any context. They\u2019ve convinced large swaths of young Americans that everything is getting worse, when the opposite is true.\n\nNearly every day, I read some new chilling climate change story. \u201cClimate Change Is Driving An Increase In A Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria And Spreading It To New Areas,\u201d says BuzzFeed. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the number of reported cases of the \u201cVibrio\u201d illness has more than tripled since 1997, from 386 to 1,256 in 201. The same day I read about the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria, I read, in far less dramatic terms, about a new pill that researchers believe might be able to prevent a third of all heart attacks and strokes, potentially saving millions of lives.\n\nOr take The Washington Post, which recently offered a beautifully packaged article written by a long-time environmental activist turned \u201creporter.\u201d It cobbled together stories of suffering under climate change. What it failed to point out is that the vast majority of Americans rely on cheap energy and will never have to alter our lifestyles because of the climate\u2014other than perhaps using air conditioning a few extra days.\n\nWe\u2019re going to have to learn to deal with Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria, because the billions of people who once lived (and live) in disease-ridden areas in the developing world will want heart pills and cars and air conditioners. No sane nation is going to run its economy on expensive and unproductive energy sources.\n\nSome people will argue that the failure of previous scares to materialize doesn\u2019t mean this one isn\u2019t real. Some people will argue human adaptation doesn\u2019t mean that climate change isn\u2019t happening. Of course not. But adaptation is the point.\n\nThe story of humankind is one of acclimatization. We use technological advances and efficiencies to deal with change. We will adapt to organic and anthropogenic changes, as we always do, because it\u2019s a lot cheaper than dismantling modernity. That\u2019s the reality, no matter how hysterical activists get on TV.", "description": "If outlets did their jobs, reporters would challenge some of the assumptions and exaggerations about climate change.
