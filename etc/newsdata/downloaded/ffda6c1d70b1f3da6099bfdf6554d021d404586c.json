As stalwart frontline troops of the NHS. Or as the poor bloody infantry fighting a rearguard action against overwhelming odds.\n\nAs family doctors know only too well, both descriptions are true.\n\nAnd overwork, stress and exhaustion are driving them out of medicine and into \u00adretirement in droves.\n\nThat only makes the problem of too few doctors for too many patients even worse.\n\nWe\u2019ve already lost 1,600 GPs and another 7,000 are predicted to go before 2024.\n\nThis not only means patients suffering the agony of their illnesses not being caught early enough but extra costs to an already cash-strapped health service treating disease in its advanced stages.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nYet diagnosis and remedy are only part of the job. GPs are also there to comfort and reassure, to be a family\u2019s friend.\n\nPatients are now waiting an average of 15 days for an appointment \u2013 often longer.\n\nWhat we need is 30 million extra slots to cut down waits \u2013 and the way to get them is with 5,000 more GPs.\n\nBut this cannot happen overnight. It takes 10 years to train for general practice. That\u2019s why we\u2019re campaigning for action now.\n\nThe sooner the Government starts on this the better.\n\nHardly a credit\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough having to claim Universal Credit in the first place.\n\nBut it is even worse to discover claimants are being slagged off behind their backs by those hired to help them navigate the confusing system.\n\nYet that is exactly what is happening at one call centre \u2013 and a horrified whistleblower gave us the tape to prove it.\n\nThis goes beyond mere workplace banter. These were foul slurs on vulnerable people.\n\nTo hold them in such contempt is contemptible. The principle behind UC is sound.\n\nBut in practice, its roll-out has been a \u00adshambles. And that\u2019s because the Tories are unable to grasp how to make it work.\n\nThe Government needs to get a grip urgently. And if it cannot, then it must do what one of those noxious call centre managers viciously advocated for claimants.\n\nPut a grenade under it.\n\nGet it sorted\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nLiquorice Allsorts are not as popular as they used to be, with sales down 10 per cent in the past year alone.\n\nThe sweets also fall foul of new recommendations, which say they should contain less than 50 per cent sugar.\n\nWe hope that the makers find a way of meeting this target without causing any change in the taste.\n\nThat way our, Allsorts would be all sorted.", "description": "Overwork, stress and exhaustion are forcing doctors in to retirement in their droves - and the government must act now", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20051010.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Doctor-calling-a-patient-in-waiting-room.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
