Michelle Lujan Grisham unveiled a plan Wednesday to make public college tuition free for all state residents.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201can absolute game-changer\u201d for the state, according to Grisham, a Democrat. Experts say it may well provide an example of good practice for state and local officials across the country who are crafting their own free college programs.\n\nIf state lawmakers approve the proposal, the New Mexico Opportunity Scholarship program will pay for all state-college tuition and fees that aren\u2019t already covered by federal grants and a state lottery. That\u2019s an unpaid gap ranging from 25% to 40% of a student\u2019s tuition bill. The program doesn\u2019t cover students\u2019 living expenses.\n\nNo age requirements combined with no income limits will make a powerful one-two punch.\n\nThe program could underwrite tuition for the estimated 55,000 students at the state\u2019s 29 public universities and community colleges as soon as fall 2020. The program will cost between $25 and $35 million a year. The state will pay for the program through its general fund, a Grisham spokeswoman told MarketWatch. She noted oil and gas revenue have been boosting the fund in recent years.\n\nNew Mexico isn\u2019t the first state to offer free college, but it\u2019s one to watch for other states considering similar initiatives, experts say. \u201cIt feels like a good step forward,\u201d added Julie Margetta Morgan, a fellow studying higher education at the Roosevelt Institute.\n\nFree public college is an emerging response to rising school costs and to the $1.5 trillion Americans already owe in student loans. At least 20 states have free college programs in some fashion, in addition to another 150 cities, counties and school districts.\n\nBut they all come with a hodge-podge of conditions, which range from age restrictions to the type of school and income requirements. For example, New York\u2019s Excelsior program will pay for public-college tuition for eligible students from families earning up to $125,000.\n\nMichelle Miller-Adams, a senior researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich., notes there\u2019s still a lot of unexplained details surrounding the new free college plan. \u201cWhat I like about the sound of the New Mexico program is how simple they are keeping it,\u201d she said.\n\nHere\u2019s three ways New Mexico stands apart from other states:\n\nThere\u2019s no income requirement\n\nIf students can pick between two- and four-year options, that gives them \u201ca lot more choice,\u201d Miller-Adams said. And having a choice matters, she added. \u201cThe two- and four-year option allows students to do a better job finding a better fit, which really helps with outcomes.\u201d\n\nMorgan said across-the-board rules on schools and income were critical. \u201cIf we want to achieve more equitable access to education,\u201d it has to include the entire college system.\n\nThere\u2019s no age requirement\n\nNew Mexico is not alone here. Washington State doesn\u2019t have age requirements in its forthcoming free college plan set to go live next year, Miller-Adams said. But no age requirements combined with no income limits will make a powerful one-two punch, she said. Many adults who took some college courses but never got there degree, she said. But \u201cit\u2019s really the credentialing and that degree that help you in the labor force.\u201d\n\nAround 37% of 19.9 million students at college this fall are 25 and above, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. \u201cIf we want a free college plan that match the reality of who college students are these days, we can\u2019t have age restrictions,\u201d Morgan added.\n\nIt appears to be a very simple program\n\nMiller-Adams said the rules \u2014 at least, as they appear now \u2014 are easy to follow. That matters, and not just for people looking to avoid a maze of paperwork and confusing regulations. \u201cThe more fine print, the worse you are, because it makes the messaging harder,\u201d she said.\n\nComplicated rules can depress participation in free-college programs, she said. It\u2019s also important to keep the message simple so the next generation can also hear it loud and clear, she said. If kids go to school understanding there\u2019s a free-college program waiting for them, \u201cthat could be a pretty powerful tool for creating a more college-going culture,\u201d Miller-Adams said.\n\nMorgan at the Roosevelt Institute agreed simplicity has its benefits. But it really matters how officials carry out the program, she said.\n\nMorgan pointed to the federal public service loan forgiveness program as something that sounds simple, but really isn\u2019t. After 10 years of payments, teachers and other public sector and non-profit workers are technically allowed to wipe away their student loan debts. But the Education Department has rejected 99% of the forgiveness applications.\n\n\u201cSimplicity has to be both in the message and the design of the program,\u201d Morgan said.", "description": "At least 20 states have free college programs in some fashion, in addition to another 150 cities, counties and school districts.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR577_free_c_ZG_20190918160521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
