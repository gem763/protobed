Brown lived across the hall from Jean and testified at the trial of former police officer Amber Guyger that he never heard her tell anyone to put their hands up as she claimed during the trial. So when Brown was shot and killed days after testifying there was immediate suspicion that his death might be connected to the trial.\n\nLee Merritt, who was an attorney for Jean\u2019s family and for Brown\u2019s family called his death \u201csuspicious.\u201d He also suggested the Dallas PD should let someone else investigate the case. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund called his death, \u201cdeeply alarming and highly suspicious.\u201d Shaun King announced a reward of $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of those who killed Brown. King also asked Dallas PD to let someone else investigate.\n\nWhile these high-profile voices wouldn\u2019t quite voice the exact suspicion they had, the suggestion was being made in some corners of the internet that the death probably was connected to the Guyer case and might involve the Dallas PD.\n\nIf you don't want people to speculate then you need to ARREST the perpetrators.\n\nThere were CAMERAS. It was a GATED community. It's NOT that hard to solve\u2026unless the people who are supposed to be solving it are NOT TRYING to solve it.\n\nAnd that is NOT \"speculation.\"\n\nIt's MATH https://t.co/LGuXPzlqo2 \u2014 Black Authority (@TheBlackChannel) October 7, 2019\n\nToday, the Dallas Police announced they had identified three suspects in the shooting. Their conclusion: This was a drug deal gone wrong.\n\nThe suspects \u2014 Jacquerious Mitchell, 20; Michael Mitchell, 32; and Thaddeous Green, 22 \u2014 are from Alexandria, Louisiana, and investigators believe they were in Dallas to buy drugs from Joshua Brown , Assistant Chief Avery Moore said at a news conference. Moore said Jacquerious Mitchell told police that Brown shot him in the chest after Green and Brown began fighting during the drug deal, and that Green then shot Brown twice. Jacquerious Mitchell is in a Dallas hospital in \u201ccritical condition,\u201d police said. Neither Michael Mitchell, who is Jacquerious\u2019 uncle, nor Thaddeous Green are in custody. Green left with Brown\u2019s backpack and gun, police said. Authorities confiscated 12 pounds (5.4 kilograms) of marijuana, 149 grams of THC cartridges and more than $4,000 in cash during a search of Brown\u2019s home.\n\nSo this settles it, right? Well, not for everyone:\n\nJoshua Brown\u2019s family deserves closure, but this doesn\u2019t seem right. https://t.co/2ImKaGAjv0 \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) October 8, 2019\n\nA week after testifying in the highest national profile trial Dallas has had since Jack Ruby's, and one that got the local cops all inflamed, this guy decides to get into bulk weed sales and people come all the way from Louisiana to buy from him and end up shooting him?\n\nPK? https://t.co/DJ3ZcG7Szc \u2014 Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) October 8, 2019\n\nIf anything ever happens to me, just know I have never ever ever in my entire life \u2014 nor would I ever \u2014 drive 4 hours for a few pounds of weed. In Texas, no less. Ain\u2019t no Texas weed that\u2019s that good. Sorry to Texans but I know y\u2019all ain\u2019t got it like that. #DallasOnSomeBullshit \u2014 Alicia Garza (@aliciagarza) October 8, 2019\n\nWho is investigating the Dallas Police Department? \u2014 saira rao (@sairasameerarao) October 8, 2019\n\nFor days @MeritLaw all but begged the @DallasPD to not lead this investigation \u2013 knowing that the community would never believe them. They ignored his advice and today came out with perhaps the most outrageous story I\u2019ve heard in my entire life. https://t.co/MhdJleXY9u \u2014 Shaun King (@shaunking) October 8, 2019\n\nKing has spent the past hour RTing people calling the police story into question, like this one (note the hashtag):\n\nDallas PD wants us to believe that 3 guys drove 4.5 hours from Louisiana to Dallas to buy weed, killed the guy who was going to sell it to them and then 1 of them snitched on his whole crew before being charged with capital murder? #JoshuaBrownWasLynched https://t.co/sjMyvzIk9R \u2014 Bruce Coleridge-Taylor Wright (@bctw) October 8, 2019\n\nLots of people on Twitter are just outright saying that the suspects are being framed for a murder committed by the police. I\u2019m not going to post any of those tweets because most of the people making them only have a few hundred followers. But the idea is definitely still circulating out there.\n\nHere\u2019s the full police press conference:", "description": "Mystery solved.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Joshua-Brown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
