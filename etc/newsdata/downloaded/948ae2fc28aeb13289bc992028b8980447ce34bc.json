And what it\u2019s about, ladies and gentlemen is hijacking the environmental movement, hijacking the issue of health and safety, and camouflaging it on behalf of socialism/Marxism. Now, think about the climate change movement: What is it all about? An enormous power grab by the federal government, politicians, and bureaucrats.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s evening\u2019s debate lent credence to Mr. Levin\u2019s claims as Sen. Bernard Sanders, one of the Democratic candidates, defended his $16 trillion climate change proposal.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for the survival of the planet Earth, our only planet,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cHow is this not a major priority? It must be a major priority. \u2026 We are the most powerful nation on earth. We should be leading the world to a global energy transition.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren blasted \u201cthe fossil fuel industry\u201d and vowed to end the use of nuclear fuels in the U.S. by 2035.\n\n\u201c[President Trump] says the Green New Deal is a dream? I\u2019m just saying where he is right now is a nightmare,\u201d Ms. Warren said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we really do have to start this conversation. Don\u2019t sit around and tell me what\u2019s not possible. Sit around and look what happens if we don\u2019t make change. You know, we\u2019ve got what, eleven years, maybe, to reach a point where we\u2019ve cut our emissions in half? \u2026 You bet that this is a moment where we better dream big and fight hard.\u201d\n\nMr. Levin warned that if Democrats succeed in forwarding the Green New Deal, it would exponentially increase the federal government\u2019s control over every facet of American life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no end to this,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cImagine, in addition to nationalizing health care, nationalizing education, nationalizing debt of all sorts. Imagine that, plus the federal government politicians having the power to act and do pretty much whatever they want under this rubric of climate change. And the media are not merely reporting on this; the media are advancing this. The media are prodding this. \u2026 Your lives will change forever.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Green New Deal is all about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a Red New Deal. Everything in your home, your home itself, your automobile, the clothing you wear, the job you have, all of it will be affected. All of it will be monitored. All of it will be regulated. To make you poorer, to make you less independent, to make you less free.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
