Harris, of the Bendari Foundation, which helped establish the UCLA Bedari Kindness Insitute.\n\nSTUDENT BARRED FROM HANDING OUT 'JESUS LOVES YOU' VALENTINES WINS CASE AGAINST WISCONSIN COLLEGE\n\n\u201cUniversities should always be places where we teach students to reach across lines of difference and treat one another with empathy and respect \u2014 even when we deeply disagree,\u201d UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement. \u201cThe UCLA Bedari Kindness Institute will bring the best thinking to this vital issue and, I think, will allow us to have a real social impact on future generations.\u201d\n\nThe institute, housed in the division of social sciences, will support research on understanding kindness through evolutionary, biological, psychological, economic, cultural and sociological perspectives. The goal is to use kindness as an \"antidote\" to \"current world politics, violence, and strife,\" according to Darnell Hunt, dean of the UCLA division of social sciences.\n\nLIBERAL SEMINARY STUDENTS WORSHIP POTTED PLANTS AS 'THE BEINGS WHO SUSTAIN US'\n\nThe private family foundation funding the new initiative aims \"to enable significant cultural shifts in the fields of health and wellness, community displacement and environmental conservation.\"\n\nMatthew Harris, the foundation\u2019s co-founder and a 1984 UCLA graduate, said, \u201cMuch research is needed to understand why kindness can be so scarce in the modern world. As we seek...to bridge the divide between science and spirituality...we hope to educate and empower more and more people in the practice of kindness.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe new institute \"will provide seed funding for research projects that examine the social and physical mechanics of kindness and how kindness might be harnessed to create more humane societies.
