This exhibit at the New-York Historical Society, with photographs by six female Life photographers, is about to close this Sunday (October 6), and it\u2019s my favorite arty thing in a long time. The photos are so enthralling that I wish the whole show were three times as big. If you\u2019re thinking, Female photographers? Aren\u2019t they so much better than the boy ones? It seems unfair to give them all this attention, the men might feel bad, oh well, too bad!\n\nThe photographers \u2014 Margaret Bourke-White, Hansel Mieth, Marie Hansen, Martha Holmes, Nina Leen, and Lisa Larsen \u2014 each get a section of wall, showcasing one of their photo essays in the magazine from the 1930s to the 1970s, beginning with Bourke-White\u2019s \u201cFranklin Roosevelt\u2019s Wild West,\u201d about laborers partying hard while building a dam in Montana. Here are some highlights from the exhibit.\n\nPhoto: Nina Leen, \u00a9 LIFE Picture Collection, Meredith Corporation\n\nThe \u201cAmerican Woman\u2019s Dilemma\u201d is a stinging 1947 photo essay by Nina Leen that shows women juggling the demands of work and motherhood. I\u2019ll be thinking about this image of a single working woman eating a sandwich while reading a book for a long time.\n\nPhoto: George Cardoza, \u00a9 LIFE Picture Collection, Meredith Corporation\n\nThe most compelling photos in the room are the portraits of the photographers themselves. There\u2019s Margaret Bourke-White bundled up in thick snow gear, literally going to war, covering World War II. And Martha Holmes wearing billowy culottes as she props herself on rocky debris, preparing for a shot. The culottes!\n\nPhoto: Martha Holmes, \u00a9 LIFE Picture Collection, Meredith Corporation\n\nHolmes took this electric photo of the jazz singer Billy Eckstine hugging a white woman in 1950, which at the time spurred a load of racist hate mail to Eckstine and the magazine. At the exhibit, you can see the other shots from that roll of film as the scene plays out in Holmes\u2019s lens. For a moment, you\u2019re there too.\n\nPhoto: Nina Leen, \u00a9 LIFE Picture Collection, Meredith Corporation\n\nThis is another one from the \u201cDilemma\u201d story. In the magazine spread, there\u2019s a timeline to the right with housewife Marjorie McWeeney\u2019s daily schedule. At 8:00 a.m.: HUSBAND JOHN TO WORK. WASH DISHES. CLEAN DOWNSTAIRS. CALL GROCER\u2019S. This photo shows Marjorie in a Bloomingdale\u2019s, posing with a week\u2019s worth of chores: \u201c35 beds to make, 750 items of glass and china [to wash], 400 silverware to wash, 175 pounds of food to prepare, 250 pieces of laundry to handle.\u201d Marjorie, bless her, grins.\n\nPhoto: Marie Hansen, \u00a9 LIFE Picture Collection, Meredith Corporation\n\nMarie Hansen\u2019s 1942 photos of \u201cThe WAACs\u201d (The Women\u2019s Army Corps) teach a history lesson I\u2019m embarrassed that I\u2019ve only just learned. During World War II, over 150,000 women enlisted to take on the duties that men deployed in combat left behind. Hansen\u2019s photos range from cute \u2014 the recruits getting their hair cut \u2014 to more disturbing: a crowd of WAACs wearing gas masks.\n\nI\u2019m really pushing hard for everyone I know and love to see this exhibit, so I will add that on the same floor of the museum, there\u2019s an ongoing exhibit of Tiffany lamps. It surprised me how much I loved that too \u2014 it\u2019s interactive, interesting, and lampy. Afterward, walk through Central Park, take a nap on a patch of grass, and then get a Martini at Bemelmans when the piano guy shows up at 5:30 p.m. Boom. You did it. The perfect New York afternoon.\n\n\u201cLIFE: Six Women Photographers\u201d is at the New-York Historical Society until Sunday, October 6.
