The House Appropriations and Budget Committees requested a tranche of documents from the Office of Management and Budget in hopes of establishing how and why that aid\u2014granted to Ukraine without incident since 2015\u2014stalled over the course of the last several months before being released earlier in September. The whistleblower\u2019s complaint only glances at the issue of the held-up aid, which is at the heart of whether Trump attempted to establish a quid-pro-quo with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the committees will also subpoena witnesses of Trump\u2019s communications with Ukrainian officials or if they will call on Giuliani for questioning. Asked Monday if he would cooperate and agree to an interview on Capitol Hill, the Trump attorney said, \u201cNo, not [with] the corrupt ones like Schiff and Nadler.\u201d Giuliani also cited attorney-client privilege between him and the president.\n\nFriday\u2019s salvo represents the first serious move by House Democrats to learn more about the substance of an explosive complaint from an anonymous whistleblower, which has become the basis of their newly-minted impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint, made public on Thursday, laid out efforts by Trump, Giuliani, and other U.S. officials to pressure Ukrainian officials\u2014including the president, Volodomyr Zelensky\u2014into investigating the business dealings of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, in the country. It also documents the unusual steps White House officials took to conceal not only a conversation between Trump and Zelensky but other conversations between the president and different foreign leaders, too.\n\nIn addition to the subpoenas, the committees also teed up depositions, scheduled to take place over the next two weeks, of five State Department officials key to the Ukraine probe. They include Gordon Sondland and Kurt Volker\u2014the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine, respectively\u2014whom the whistleblower alleges were tasked with helping Ukrainian officials navigate Trump\u2019s expectations.\n\nThe first person scheduled to be deposed is Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled in May under circumstances the whistleblower described as politically motivated. Trump called Yovanovitch \u201cbad news\u201d in his July call with Zelensky.\n\nMembers of the House Intelligence Committee\u2014which is taking a lead role in the Ukraine-focused impeachment probe\u2014will remain in Washington for at least a portion of the upcoming two-week recess to continue building evidence.\n\nIn a Friday letter to colleagues, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) said the chairs \u201c will be actively working on these matters throughout the recess.\u201d He also revealed that the committee will hold a closed briefing with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\u2014the official who first explained to lawmakers why the whistleblower\u2019s complaint was being held up by administration officials\u2014on October 4.\n\n\u201cMore subpoenas and investigatory steps will occur next week, as the investigation accelerates,\u201d Schiff continued, \u201cand we will update you as those steps become public.\n\nThe Daily Beast first reported in June that Democrats on Capitol Hill were preparing to open an investigation into Giuliani\u2019s work in Ukraine as it related to Biden and whether it worked against U.S. foreign policy interests. That investigation has expanded since then to include Trump\u2019s communications with Zelensky as well as the State Department\u2019s overtures to Giuliani and other Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe investigating congressional committees requested documents related to their probe from Pompeo more than two weeks ago.", "description": "The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and Oversight committees are demanding documents on Trump and Rudy Giuliani\u2019s efforts to dig up damaging information on rival Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Sam Brodey", "National Security Reporter", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3375,w_6000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569615254/GettyImages-1167242151_zasiia", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
