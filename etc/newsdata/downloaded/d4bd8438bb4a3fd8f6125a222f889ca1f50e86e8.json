But it feels right to have it back,\" Zoe said after finding the book, which she re-purchased for 50p.\n\n\"I wonder how many other kids read it over the years? I couldn't believe it when I opened it up.\"\n\n\"I think when things work their way back to you, they were never meant to leave you in the first place.\"\n\nImage copyright Museum of English Rural Life Image caption The Museum of English Rural Life found Zoe's copy of The Secret Garden in a charity shop\n\nDanielle Eade, who works at the museum, commented: \"Zoe almost didn't tell us the story behind it. When she did, I couldn't let her leave without finding out more and asking her for a photo. It was such a lovely and heart-warming tale.\"\n\nOthers have shared their own stories of precious objects lost and found.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @melepolykolo We had a second hand bookshop. My father in law unpacked a box of books one day and found a hard cover Biggles given to him by auntie Eva- 60 years before, 11th birthday in a totally different part of the country. Awesome round trip. His most treasured book now \u2014 Mele (@melepolykolo) October 18, 2019 Report\n\n\"A few years ago my girlfriend and I strolled into an antiques store while our husbands took a walk.\n\n\"Imagine my amazement when I spotted a wedding photo of my parents on the wall! It had belonged to my grandparents and my uncle disposed of \"unwanted\" family photos when Grandma died,\" wrote Twitter user Narelle Hahn-Smith.\n\nZoe Laura King also commented on Twitter: \"I had a favourite board game as a child where you went to tube stations. My friend owned it. We decided it wasn't hard enough so we wrote new game cards.\n\n\"Home from university, off to babysit, I bought the game from a charity shop. I discovered cards in my 10 year old writing.\"", "description": "Zoe identified her childhood copy of The Secret Garden by the hieroglyphics she wrote on the cover.", "authors": ["Bbc Trending", "What'S Popular"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F62D/production/_109312036_secretgarden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
