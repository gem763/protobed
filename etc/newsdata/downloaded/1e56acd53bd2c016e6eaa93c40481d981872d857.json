He acquired the vase for HK$24 million in 2000.\n\nEnameled glass vessels in the Qianlong period, painted in Western styles with vibrant colors, were by far the most complex and demanding of all works of art commissioned at the Beijing Palace Workshops. The one from Tsao\u2019s collection is the most successful of all surviving examples, Sotheby\u2019s said.\n\nThe 18.2-centimeter tall vase is in the shape of a pouch, which in Chinese is a homophone of \u201ca package of luck and fortune.\u201d The vase features a pink sash at the neck; a pair of phoenix soaring amid clouds and peonies, one bud with the blue-enamel mark; and a four-character seal mark reading \"Qianlong Nianzhi\u201d (which means \u201cmade in the Qianlong period\u201d).\n\nThe exceptionally rare blue-and-white \"dragon\" stem bowl from Xuande period sells for HK$75 million at Sotheby's. Courtesy of Sotheby's\n\nAnother highlight at Sotheby\u2019s sale of Chinese works of art on Oct. 8 is the blue-and-white \u201cDragon\u201d stem bowl offered from the collection of Alan Chuang, chairman of Hong Kong-based investment firm Chuang\u2019s Consortium.\n\nThe bowl, from the Ming Dynasty Xuande period (1426-1435), is painted in rich cobalt-blue tones with a pair of scaly five-clawed dragons soaring sinuously, one with its head turned back, the other with its head looking forward.\n\nThe bowl achieved HK$75 million, against a presale estimate of HK$60 million.", "description": "The rare vessel was offered from the collection of Taiwanese tycoon Robert Tsao", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114943/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
