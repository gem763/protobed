The cultural center opened in 1997 and is equipped with multiple systems designed to protect it from fire, including more fire-resistant weeds on the grounds surrounding the center.\n\nThe fast-moving brush fire had started at around 1:30 a.m., prompting authorities to issue mandatory evacuations to 3,000 homes and shut down parts of the 405 freeway, a main commuter artery that stretches from north of Los Angeles into Orange County. It comprises the northern section of the San Diego Freeway. Some of the city\u2019s most exclusive and wealthy neighborhoods are in the fire zone.\n\nBy Monday night, the 405 freeway from the 101 freeway to Sunset Blvd. was reopened and a small section of the evacuation order had been lifted but Garcetti said most residents need to be prepared for at least two nights out of their homes.\n\n\u201cFor the great majority of folks, we are not repopulating tonight,\u201d he said.\n\nA total of 10,000 structures were within the mandatory evacuation zone with eight having been destroyed and six damaged, the L.A. Fire Department said.\n\nAround 1,100 firefighters were fighting the blaze and were \u201cmaking good progress,\u201d L.A. Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas said, and he expects them to make even better progress Tuesday until the evening when the winds were forecast to pick up again.\n\nHe said crews conducted 18 rescued missions since the fire began.\n\n\u201cAll of these individuals were elderly and all of them are doing well,\u201d he said.\n\nMonday morning, Garcetti urged homeowners to not fight the fire with garden hoses and to leave immediately.\n\n\u201cThe only thing you cannot replace is you and your family,\u201d Garcetti told reporters, saying some residents had just 15 minutes to flee.\n\n\u201cMany have asked about the art \u2014 it is protected by state-of-the-art technology,\u201d the Getty Center said, adding that the museum is to the south and east of the blaze. \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d\n\nThe Getty Fire is one of several burning across the state.\n\nThe Kincade Fire in Sonoma County has burned 74,324 acres so far and is still burning as narrow roads and steep terrain make access to the fire difficult, Cal Fire said. Sonoma County is famous California wine country located just north of San Francisco. The Soda Rock and Field Stone wineries were totally destroyed by fire.\n\nThe flames have destroyed 123 structures and put over 90,000 others, including 80,000 residences, at risk. The blaze was just 15 percent contained Monday evening, which was a 10 percent increase from Sunday night, giving fire officials some hope.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the cusp of cautious optimism,\u201d Cal Fire Division Chief Jonathan Cox said in an evening press conference in Santa Rosa. \u201cWe\u2019re still contending with that ping-pong effect of the wind. As containment goes up, our confidence grows, but we are not out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nThe fire has led authorities to issue new evacuate orders in Lake County on top of the 180,000 residents already told to leave their homes though some evacuation orders were lifted earlier in the day.\n\nMore than 4,370 firefighters were working to contain the blaze with the use of 468 engines and 10 helicopters, Cal Fire said.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it is planning more blackouts Tuesday and Wednesday, over what it called \u201csevere wind events.\u201d The scheduled blackouts follow others that have affected millions of California residents so far this month. The strategy is aimed at mitigating the risk of equipment failure and wildfire.\n\n\u201cPacific Gas and Electric Company\u2019s emergency operations center, operations and meteorology teams, have been monitoring a new potentially widespread, strong and dry wind event Tuesday morning through midday Wednesday,\u201d the utility said in a statement Sunday.\n\n\u201c[The blackouts are] expected to impact portions of 32 counties in the Northern and Southern Sierra, North Bay, Bay Area and Santa Cruz mountains, North Coast and Kern County.\u201d\n\nPG&E said it has given a half-million customers a 48-hour notice of the impending blackouts.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency over the weekend as a number of wildfires burned across the state.\n\nNewsom toured the command center in Santa Rosa Monday evening and commended the firefighters on their efforts.\n\n\u201cI recognize and everybody recognizes this cannot be the new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot absorb this year after year.\u201d\n\nPG&E said the next round of blackouts \u2014 part of what it calls a Public Safety Power Shutoff \u2014 could occur as early as Tuesday morning. The counties affected are Alameda, Alpine, Amador, Butte, Calaveras, Colusa, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Glenn, Humboldt, Kern, Lake, Marin, Mariposa, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Tehama, Trinity, Tuolumne, Yolo and Yuba.\n\nThe utility said Sunday more than 1 million customers have been affected by both planned and unplanned blackouts in recent days.\n\n\u201cThe sole purpose of [the plan] is to significantly reduce catastrophic wildfire risk,\u201d said Michael Lewis, PG&E senior vice resident of electric operations.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 Over a thousand firefighters were working to contain a fast-moving wildfire that threatens thousands of homes in California as well", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
