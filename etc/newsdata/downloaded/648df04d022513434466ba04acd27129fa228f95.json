Building play is like climbing a ladder. If you can't get onto the first rung and play through midfield, then you can't get to the goal.\n\nOur front three is as good as anyone's in world football but we couldn't create the supply for them until the hour mark, when at last we changed back to a single deep-lying midfielder.\n\nWith Mount and Henderson flanking Rice, we immediately looked far more comfortable and fluid, and began to create more chances.", "description": "MARTIN KEOWN - INSIGHT: Gareth Southgate will have learned a lot about his players on Friday in what would have been a very disappointing night for him.", "authors": ["Martin Keown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19609018-0-image-a-6_1570829701340.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
