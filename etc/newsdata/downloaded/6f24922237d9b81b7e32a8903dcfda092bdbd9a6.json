NSANY 2.18% \u2019s board will discuss on Monday a plan to replace Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, and if directors approve the plan it would set in motion a formal search for candidates, according to people familiar with the board\u2019s plans.\n\nMr. Saikawa said Monday ahead of the meeting that he wants the directors to move forward with a succession plan \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nOne of the people familiar with the board\u2019s plans said the 65-year-old Mr. Saikawa might offer his resignation at the meeting, and Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper reported that Mr. Saikawa had expressed to confidants his intention to step down. Asked about that, Mr. Saikawa said he has long intended to hand the reins to the next generation, and he declined to elaborate.\n\nNissan\u2019s direction has been in flux since the arrest last November of then-Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who had led the company for nearly two decades. Mr. Ghosn was stripped of his Nissan posts and faces trial next year in Tokyo on charges of financial crimes, including underreporting his compensation. He has said he is innocent of all the charges.\n\nThe head of the Nissan board\u2019s new nomination committee, former government official Masakazu Toyoda, said in July that he wanted to develop a succession plan as soon as possible. The car maker created the committee after the company\u2019s shareholder meeting in June.\n\nThe committee presented its succession plan to the full board at Monday\u2019s meeting, said the people familiar with the board\u2019s plans. If approved, the committee would begin the process of looking for candidates, both inside and outside the company, to succeed Mr. Saikawa.\n\nThe committee already has drawn up a list of 10 potential candidates, but the board has thus far indicated that it would prefer the next CEO to come from within Nissan, said one of the people. The internal candidates include the current head of the company\u2019s China business, Makoto Uchida, and the executive in charge of turnaround efforts, Jun Seki, said another one of the people.\n\nThe search for a new Nissan CEO has taken on increasing urgency in recent months, as Mr. Saikawa has come under scrutiny for Nissan\u2019s dismal business performance. The company is slashing jobs around the world as it faces falling sales and profit.\n\n\u201cIt looks like there will be a storm on Monday,\u201d one of the people said. \u201cThe pressure on Saikawa is enormous now.\u201d\n\nThe board also plans to question Mr. Saikawa about the manipulation of his stock-based performance compensation, which resulted in Mr. Saikawa receiving over $400,000 in excess pay. Mr. Saikawa acknowledged last week that there was an error in his pay and said he would return the excess amount but said he hadn\u2019t been aware of the error and didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nA Nissan spokesman said the board meeting would discuss Nissan\u2019s 10-month probe into Mr. Ghosn\u2019s activities as well as the issue of stock-based performance pay. He declined to give further details.\n\nMr. Saikawa has said he hoped that the board would come up with a plan to replace him quickly but has also said he feels the responsibility to turn Nissan\u2019s business around before handing over the reins.\n\nPeople involved in the talks have said it might be difficult to replace Mr. Saikawa right away, in part because of a feeling that no clear successor has emerged yet.\n\nWhile there are senior executives who could take the Nissan CEO role as a caretaker, the board prefers that the next CEO come from a pool of younger executives, one of the people said.\n\nAnother challenge in picking a successor is Nissan\u2019s uncertain relationship with Renault SA, which owns 43.4% of the Japanese auto maker. The two companies have been discussing an overhaul of their two-decade-old partnership, which could result in Renault lowering its stake in Nissan. Reducing the stake has proved difficult because of resistance from Renault and the French government, Renault\u2019s largest shareholder.\n\nThe alliance discussions could get held up if a new person takes the helm at Nissan.\n\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com and Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com", "description": "Nissan Motor\u2019s board will discuss on Monday a plan to replace Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa, and if directors approve the plan it would set in motion a formal search for candidates.", "authors": ["Sean Mclain In Tokyo", "Nick Kostov In Paris", "Sean Mclain", "Nick Kostov", "Sean.Mclain Wsj.Com", "Nick.Kostov Dowjones.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105085/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
