The power and the beauty came from his authenticity, his conviction, the sincerity with which he held his beliefs,\u201d tweeted former South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy (R).\n\nCummings and Gowdy were the chief combatants in a Republican drive to drag down Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with a two-year investigation of her handling of the deadly 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, which occurred on her watch as secretary of state. The episode was one of countless in which Cummings delivered his sonorous admonition: \u201cWe are better than this.\u201d\n\nIt was just a few months back that President Trump attacked Cummings as a \u201cbrutal bully,\u201d whose congressional district was \u201ca disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live.\u201d Trump sneered when Cummings\u2019s house was robbed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut even Trump briefly interrupted his raging about the House impeachment inquiry to sound an uncharacteristically graceful note on his Twitter feed about the tenacious character of a man who would have been a key figure in that investigation: \u201cI got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!\u201d\n\nUndergirding that strength and passion and wisdom was a faith in human potential, which came from Cummings\u2019s own life story. The son of onetime sharecroppers, he had been told by an elementary school counselor that he was too slow and inarticulate to ever live his dream of being a lawyer. Others, however, saw his potential and encouraged the drive that propelled Cummings from the pecial-education classes of his early years to Howard University, where he was Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nAs ranking member and then chairman of the oversight committee, Cummings was known for leaving rancor behind in the hearing room. When he and his aides prepared for hearings, Cummings would say he wanted to open with an \u201cI believe\u201d statement, something that would remind everyone that there were principles on which they agreed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was known for unfailing consideration and sensitivity, not just for other members but also for their staffs, regardless of political party. When Kurt Bardella, chief spokesman for then-chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), was fired in 2011 for mishandling emails from reporters, Cummings sought out and comforted the humiliated young aide who had been working against him on nearly every issue.\n\n\u201cThere was such a respect, no matter where you sat on the aisle, for Cummings, because he was a fundamentally decent guy, and a fair guy,\u201d Bardella told me.\n\nDuring a hearing early this year, Cummings calmed tempers when Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) accused fellow committee member Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) of stationing an African American Trump administration official to stand behind him as \u201ca prop.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCummings asked Tlaib to clarify whether she was calling Meadows a racist \u2014 she said she wasn\u2019t \u2014 and told Meadows, one of the House\u2019s most conservative members, \u201cYou are one of my best friends . . . and I can see and I feel your pain . . . and I don\u2019t think Ms. Tlaib intended to cause you that kind of pain.\u201d Later, Meadows sought out Tlaib, thanked her for being gracious, and the two shared a hug.\n\nAD\n\nSure, moments like that are fleeting, and growing rarer.\n\nJust minutes after Trump\u2019s tweet offering condolences to Cummings\u2019s family and friends, the president began firing off a new series ranting about a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) held a news conference in which she struggled with her emotion as she recalled her fellow Baltimore native who had \u201clived the American Dream and he wanted it for everyone else.\u201d But the topic quickly turned to impeachment and Trump\u2019s \u201cmeltdown\u201d during a White House meeting with congressional leaders the day before.\n\nAD\n\nAll of which suggested that Cummings didn\u2019t really have it right. We aren\u2019t better than this.\n\nBut if we hold close the example he set, there is always the possibility that we could be.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "Undergirding Cummings\u2019s strength, passion and wisdom was a faith in human potential.", "authors": ["Karen Tumulty", "Columnist Covering National Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DiBe4R280rs-C7HKKZbb2yCN8JE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HOD4JTRZ5EI6TIWNGB5QNUBFPM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
