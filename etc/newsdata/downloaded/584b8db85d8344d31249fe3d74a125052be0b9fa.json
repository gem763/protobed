This includes email, collaboration, file storage, messaging, and video calling, and will be used by over 3 million military personnel.\n\nOn Thursday, the US General Services Administration and the Department of Defense announced that DEOS had been awarded to CSRA LLC, which is owned General Dynamics Information Technology, and its contractor teaming partners Dell Marketing LP and Minburn Technology Group LLC. These companies plan to build a solution using Microsoft's products.\n\n\"DEOS will streamline our use of cloud email and collaborative tools while enhancing cybersecurity and information sharing based on standardized needs and market offerings,\" Department of Defense Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy said in a statement.\n\nOf note is that this is separate from the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract \u2014 the contentious cloud deal that's under review after President Donald Trump himself expressed concerns with the award process. Microsoft and Amazon are both bidding directly for JEDI, with Amazon the favorite to win.\n\nThat's a key distinction from this DEOS contract: This deal was bid on by resellers, who will actually do the work of designing and implementing how the Department of Defense will use Microsoft Office 365. This means that Microsoft will get a sizable cut of the contract's proceeds, but much of it will go to those partners.\n\nPreviously, analysts predicted that DEOS was all but guaranteed as a win for Microsoft \u2014 while competitors like Google have their own cloud productivity suites, Microsoft Office 365 was widely considered to be the only one that could meet the stringent security requirements mandated by the deal. The only mystery, then, was which resellers would win the deal.\n\nRead more: As Amazon fights for a $10 billion Pentagon cloud deal, Microsoft is a 'lock-in' for an $8 billion government contract that nobody else can really win\n\nIn March, Microsoft announced new software designed for government use and with higher government security certifications.\n\nMicrosoft, GDIT, and Dell declined comment.
