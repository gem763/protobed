Sputnik/Alexei Druzhinin/Kremlin via REUTERS\n\nRussia\u2019s warning came a day after it struck an accord with Turkey calling for the complete pullout of the YPG fighters, which were once U.S. allies but which Ankara calls terrorists.\n\nThe police arrival in Kobani marked the start of a period when Russian and Syrian security forces will oversee the removal of YPG fighters at least 30 km (19 miles) into Syria, under the deal struck by presidents Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nA complete pullout of the YPG would mark a victory for Erdogan, who launched a cross-border offensive on Oct. 9 to drive the Syrian Kurdish militia from the border and create a \u201csafe zone\u201d for the return of Syrian refugees.\n\nRussia\u2019s Defence Ministry, quoted by TASS news agency, said the police would help facilitate the YPG withdrawal from Kobani, a border city to the west of Turkey\u2019s military operations. It was vacated by U.S. troops after President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision this month to pull out.\n\nKobani is of special significance to the Kurdish fighters, who fought off Islamic State militants trying to seize the city in 2014-15 in one of the fiercest battles of Syria\u2019s conflict. Russia said Turkish forces would not deploy in Kobani.\n\nTuesday\u2019s accord, which expands on a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal last week, underlines Putin\u2019s dominant influence in Syria and seals the return of his ally President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces to the northeastern border for the first time in years.\n\nUnder the deal, Syrian border guards were to deploy there from noon (0900 GMT) on Wednesday.\n\nSix days later, Russian and Turkish forces will jointly start to patrol a 10 km strip of land in northeast Syria where U.S. troops had long been deployed along with their former Kurdish allies.\n\nThose changes reflect the dizzying pace of changes in Syria since Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal on Oct. 6, shaking up the military balance across a quarter of the country after more than eight years of conflict.\n\nKurdish militia commanders have yet to respond to the deal reached in Russia\u2019s Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was not immediately clear how their withdrawal could be enforced.\n\nRUSSIAN WARNING\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said if Kurdish forces did not retreat, Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to fall back. \u201cAnd remaining Kurdish formations would then fall under the weight of the Turkish army,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a swipe at Washington, which has called into question how the deal will be guaranteed, Peskov said: \u201cNow they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry also dismissed a German proposal for a security zone under international control, an idea which the United States and NATO had cautiously welcomed.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF were Washington\u2019s main allies in the fight to dismantle Islamic State\u2019s self-declared caliphate in Syria. Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out was criticized by U.S. lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, as a betrayal.\n\nTrump said the ceasefire agreed between Ankara and Washington last week had held, hailing what he called a big success. \u201cKurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us,\u201d Trump tweeted, adding he would say more later on Wednesday.\n\nIn a further sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, the head of Russia\u2019s defense sales agency was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defense systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has already been frozen out of a program to buy and help produce F-35 jets and faces possible U.S. sanctions for buying the S-400 systems, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO\u2019s defenses and threaten the F-35 if operated near the stealth fighter.\n\nOvernight, Turkey\u2019s defense ministry said the United States had told Ankara the YPG had completed its withdrawal from the area of Turkey\u2019s military offensive.\n\nThere was no need to initiate another operation outside the current area of operation at this stage, the ministry said, effectively ending an offensive that began two weeks ago and drew global criticism.\n\nKay Bailey Hutchison, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, called on Wednesday for an inquiry into whether war crimes were committed during the offensive.\n\nFurther criticism of Turkey\u2019s offensive came from European Parliament members who called in a draft resolution for \u201cappropriate and targeted economic measures\u201d against Ankara.\n\nTURKEY REVIEWS MILITARY PLANS\n\nWhile Tuesday\u2019s deal addresses Turkey\u2019s call for the YPG to be pushed back from the border, it also means Ankara will have to deepen its security coordination with Damascus after years of hostility between Erdogan and Assad.\n\nTurkey may also have to moderate its own military ambitions in the region. Turkish security sources said Ankara was re-evaluating a plan to set up 12 observation posts in northeastern Syria in the wake of the deal. Russia\u2019s Defence Ministry later said the Syrian government would set up 15 posts on the border.\n\nTurkish soldiers on an infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) drive near the Turkish-Syrian border in Ceylanpinar, Turkey, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Huseyin Aldemir\n\nAssad and Putin have both said Turkish forces cannot remain in Syria in the long term.\n\n\u201cThe most significant part of the Russian-Turkish agreement is the arrival of the Syrian border guard to the northeast, something both Damascus and Russia sought for a long time,\u201d said Yury Barmin, a Middle East specialist at Moscow Policy Group.\n\n\u201cThis also means de facto recognition of Assad by Erdogan.\u201d", "description": "Russian military police arrived in the strategic Syrian city of Kobani on Wednesday as Moscow warned Kurdish YPG forces that they face further armed conflict with Turkey if they fail to withdraw from Syria's entire northeastern border.", "authors": ["Andrew Osborn", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444047182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0M1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
