Why not release the video after signing the extension, as opposed to a day after the season opener? Toronto won 5-3, with the primary focus on John Tavares being unveiled as captain.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s a cynical reading, but Marner\u2019s message would certainly ring more authentic if he wasn\u2019t reading directly off a piece of paper. All is forgiven, nonetheless, Mitch. Welcome back to Leafs Nation, we\u2019re glad you\u2019re here for the next little while, too.\n\nMore NHL coverage from Yahoo Sports", "description": "The timing is certainly curious, but Mitch Marner seems like he's relieved to be with the Maple Leafs for the next little while.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oj4arMICehSSuVXG0_PxKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD02OTkuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XwiTqbAd00CHHetAFywweg--~B/aD03Njg7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/26a48eb0-e633-11e9-a557-a39098e58032", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
