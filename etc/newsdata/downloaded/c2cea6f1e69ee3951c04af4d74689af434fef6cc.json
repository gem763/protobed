Dems are investigating allegations that Trump and Giuliani waged a shadow diplomacy campaign to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that could improve Trump\u2019s reelection chances in 2020.\n\nREAD: Democrats vow to keep GOP from turning impeachment into a 'goat rodeo'\n\nBolton has not yet been subpoenaed to appear, although his legal team has reportedly been in touch with lawyers for the House committees running the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAnderson, who served as an aide to Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, also described an episode in which the White House blocked efforts to criticize a Russian attack on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cOn November 25, 2018, Russia escalated the conflict further when its forces openly attacked and seized Ukrainian military vessels heading to a Ukrainian port in the Sea of Azov,\u201d Anderson plans to say, according to his prepared remarks. \u201cWhile my colleagues at the State Department quickly prepared a statement condemning Russia for its escalation, senior officials in the White House blocked it from being issued.\u201d\n\nCover: In this Aug. 1, 2018 file photo, Rudy Giuliani, attorney for President Donald Trump, addresses a gathering during a campaign event in Portsmouth, N.H.
