REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nThe three other defendants in the landmark ruling, which stemmed from the holding of a referendum that had been banned and a short-lived independence declaration, were found guilty only of disobedience and not sentenced to prison.\n\nAll defendants were acquitted of the gravest charge, rebellion, but other leading separatists were quick to call the ruling an \u201catrocity\u201d and an \u201cattack on democracy\u201d.\n\nMuch is at stake, both for Spain and for its wealthiest region, whose independence drive attracted worldwide attention, triggered Spain\u2019s biggest political crisis in decades and unnerved financial markets.\n\nThe main questions are how separatists will react to the verdicts, whether the promise that protests will be peaceful holds, and how the standing of both Spain and the separatist movement are affected.\n\n\u201cWhat happened on October 1 was not just a demonstration or a massive act of citizen protest. If that had been the case, there would have been no criminal sentencing. It was a tumultuous uprising encouraged by the accused, among many others,\u201d the Madrid court said in its ruling, delivered in writing rather than in an open session.\n\nThe former head of Catalonia\u2019s regional government, Carles Puigdemont, said the prison sentences for the separatist leaders were an \u201catrocity\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday we are all condemned, not just 12 people. This sentence is an attack on democracy and the rights of all citizens,\u201d said the head of Catalonia\u2019s regional parliament, Roger Torrent.The longest prison term - 13 years - went to the former deputy leader of the Catalan regional government, Oriol Junqueras.\n\nThe court convicted Junqueras and eight other leaders on charges of sedition and four of them of misuse of public funds, the court ruling showed.\n\nSeparatist protests have been largely peaceful but police sources have said authorities are prepared for any violence.\n\nAfter the ruling was published, the CDR grassroots movement tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s time to rise up against the authoritarian fascism of the Spanish state and its accomplices. It is time for the #RevoltaPopular (popular revolt).\u201d\n\nOutside the Lledoners prison in the Catalan town of Sant Joan de Villatorrada where the leaders were being held, men embraced after learning the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict.\n\nRelated Coverage Key dates in Catalonia's independence bid\n\nThe government has said it is ready to take direct control of Catalonia as it did in 2017 if secessionist leaders break the law.\n\nThe ruling is likely to colour a national election on Nov. 10, Spain\u2019s fourth in four years, and influence the direction taken by the separatist movement.\n\nAn opinion poll in July showed 48.3% of Catalans against secession and 44% in favour.", "description": "Spain's Supreme Court on Monday sentenced nine separatist leaders from Catalonia to between nine and 13 years in prison for sedition over their role in a failed bid for independence in October 2017.", "authors": ["Isla Binnie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440653061&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0N8", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
