Jennifer Arcuri is still not saying if she had an affair with Boris Johnson. Not exactly.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t want you to think, not for one minute, that she wasn\u2019t someone special in his life. Mistress, girlfriend, lover, courtesan? Pray do tell, Jennifer, what was the exact nature of your role? We are all dying to know.\n\n\u2018I was Boris\u2019s Anne Boleyn,\u2019 says Arcuri in her first print interview since the scandal broke. You were? \u2018I sure was,\u2019 she insists.\n\n\u2018Anne Boleyn made Henry VIII literally crazy for six years because she wouldn\u2019t give him her virtue. She never gave away too much of herself because she knew that if she did, what happened to her sister would happen to her.\u2019\n\n'I was Boris\u2019s Anne Boleyn,' says Arcuri (pictured) in her first print interview since the scandal broke. You were? 'I sure was,' she insists\n\nMary Boleyn had an adulterous relationship with the king and was later banished from court.\n\nYet surely Anne\u2019s fate was worse? She seduced Henry VIII, lured him away from his loyal wife and child, only to be cruelly cast aside and her reputation ripped apart, before her life ended on a scaffold at the Tower of London.\n\nThankfully, Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s head is still on her shoulders.\n\nJust as Anne Boleyn once enjoyed the benefits of keeping a powerful man in her thrall, it is clear Jennifer did exactly the same in her relationship with the Prime Minister, back when he was the Mayor of London.\n\n\u2018I was categorically clear that the moment I gave Boris my virtue, I would be cast out. That\u2019s why I made him my buddy. I would say things like: \u201cYou don\u2019t want me, I\u2019m high maintenance and very demanding.\u201d He used to laugh and say: \u2018I don\u2019t believe that at all.\u2019\n\n\u2018I was categorically clear that the moment I gave Boris (Johnson my virtue, I would be cast out. That\u2019s why I made him my buddy. I would say things like: \u201cYou don\u2019t want me, I\u2019m high maintenance and very demanding.\u201d He used to laugh and say: \u2018I don\u2019t believe that at all.\u2019\n\nHe did? \u2018He did. He would say: \u201cJennifer, you\u2019re the Mount Everest every man wants to climb.\u201d But the last thing I wanted to be was the girl that showed up, sh***ed him and left.\u2019\n\nWho does? \u2018Right. And it was far more rewarding for me to have a friendship with Boris because he was charismatic and fun and a stimulating person.\u2019\n\nSitting across from me in the living room of her Los Angeles home, there is indeed a faint touch of the dimpled Tudor wench about her. But with her blonde hair, California tan and curvy figure she is a very modern femme fatale.\n\nAccording to her version of events, Boris never got his crampons on and made a dash for the Jen-summit. While it seems unlikely for a man with his libidinous reputation, Jennifer seems keen not to put her old friend under any more pressure, and isn\u2019t going to elaborate.\n\nWhat she will say is that they were friends from 2011 until they last spoke in 2016. A five-year \u2018thing\u2019, whatever the \u2018thing\u2019 was.\n\nHow did they spend their time together in the capital? Once they went to a restaurant called Fish! in Borough Market. On another occasion they met in an Italian restaurant, but she felt uncomfortable because people were staring at them as they sat at a corner table.\n\nShe knew of his womaniser reputation, but it did not bother her. \u2018The affair with Petronella had happened years ago. (Boris famously dated the daughter of Labour grandee Lord Wyatt for four years while he was editor of The Spectator \u2014 and while married to long-suffering wife Marina Wheeler \u2014 and got her pregnant at least once). I wasn\u2019t sitting there, questioning him about his marriage. I didn\u2019t care,\u2019 she says.\n\nThe ambitious American, a former model and DJ, agrees that it was a boost to her fledging career in technology to have one of Britain\u2019s most compelling politicians in her corner\n\nBoris, however, was extremely interested in her love life. \u2018He\u2019d say: \u201cAre you driving men crazy? Are the men filling the streets with weeping tears? I saw a man sobbing earlier \u2014 please tell me you didn\u2019t break his heart.\u201d He\u2019d ask me who I was dating and I\u2019d say: \u201cEveryone.\u201d And he was like: \u201cOh! Did you give them your virtue?\u201d \u2019\n\nSome of their dates were classic Boris, and not in the ancient Greek sense. Once he arranged to meet her at a pub near Tavistock Square in Central London, but he fell asleep at home and forgot.\n\n\u2018Then he called and said: \u201cJennifer, where are you?\u201d And I said I was going home and who the hell did he think he was. I wait for no man, Boris, not even you.\u201d\n\n\u2018He said: \u201cStay there, I\u2019m coming.\u201d So I waited in the pub and finally he arrived, all sweaty and out of breath with his bike helmet still on. He went to the bar but came back because he didn\u2019t have any money and said: \u201cJennifer, can I borrow \u00a33.10?\u201d I went: \u201cOh My God\u201d and bought him a beer.\u2019\n\nShe also prides herself on the fact that they could be frank with each other. \u2018He asked me one day: \u201cHow do I look?\u201d And I said: \u201cPale and fat \u2014 and no one likes a chubby leader!\u201d I told him to lay off the gluten and eat more vegetables and he thought that was sensible. I could talk to him like that because I was his muse.\u2019 Muse, Anne Boleyn, virtue keeper, Himalayan mountain, personal dietitian and, of course, tech support expert who could explain the intricacies of \u2018Google hangout\u2019 to the great Boris brain \u2014 this woman\u2019s role in his life is getting complicated.\n\nAnd, to be honest, it seems like an awful lot of effort for a 55-year-old, twice-married man with haystack hair who is hardly the catch of the century.\n\nJennifer looks a bit hurt at this. \u2018I just thought he was the most charismatic and engaging human. I was very much in awe of his presence. It was a complicated friendship that could have gone somewhere in another life, but it didn\u2019t.\u2019 Certainly, whatever the friendship parameters were between these two high-octane blond(e)s, it seemed to work for them both.\n\nThe ambitious American, a former model and DJ, agrees that it was a boost to her fledging career in technology to have one of Britain\u2019s most compelling politicians in her corner.\n\nJennifer persuaded then-mayor Boris to deliver the keynote speech at a networking tech event in London that she helped organise in 2012, giving her instant credibility in her adopted country.\n\nThe 34-year-old went on to set up a series of companies that were awarded \u00a3126,000 in public money and went on three overseas trade trips led by Boris after officials initially turned her down for two of them.\n\nThis has proved problematic. The PM is now facing conflict of interest allegations and is under investigation by the London Assembly over his links to Arcuri during his period of office.\n\nHe has refused to deny that he had an affair with the feisty American but insists that \u2018everything was done with complete propriety\u2019 when quizzed on the matter. And unsurprisingly, she agrees.\n\n\u2018All the grants my company received were totally above board and, as a businesswoman, I had every right to be on those trade delegations,\u2019 she tells me.\n\n\u2018My achievements are my achievements and it\u2019s not because of Boris Johnson that I\u2019ve been able to do all the things I did in England like give a TED [Technology, Entertainment, Design] talk and build successful businesses.\u2019\n\nActually, it was because of two independently organised talks in Manchester and Liverpool about her views on cyber skills and cyber security \u2014 but well done, Jennifer.\n\nSince the news broke last month, she has refused to go into detail about the extent of her relationship with the leader currently battling for Brexit.\n\nShe has teased and hinted \u2014 not admitting anything but not denying it either. On ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this week, Piers Morgan asked six times if she had been intimate with Boris and six times she refused to answer. Back home in California, she is playing the same game with me.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to say there was no affair and I don\u2019t want to say there was an affair,\u2019 she says solemnly. \u2018I just want people to see there was a unique connection between me and Boris. We definitely got on.\u2019\n\nIndeed, in contemporaneous photographs of the pair it is obvious that there was explosive chemistry surging between them.\n\nPeople noticed how struck she and Boris were with each other when they appeared at public events \u2014 and rumours of an affair have been circulating for years.\n\n\u2018There were times, at crowded events, where he\u2019d seek me out,\u2019 she acknowledges. \u2018I know this sounds crazy but when I enter a room I have a certain kind of presence, one that made him happy to see me. We did attract attention, yes.\u2019\n\nOn a trade trip to Malaysia where both were present, she addressed the rumours issue with Boris\u2019s PR chief Will Walden. \u2018I walked right over to Will and said: \u201cLook \u2014 no story. It\u2019s complete smoke and mirrors.\u201d \u2019 And what did Mr Walden say? \u2018He said: \u201cLet\u2019s just keep it that way, Jennifer.\u201d \u2019\n\nYou can see why Boris \u2014 or any red-blooded man \u2014 would find Jennifer attractive.\n\nWith her low, throaty voice and mane of golden hair she oozes sex appeal and is good fun.\n\nShe does a clever Boris impression (\u2018Jennifer, do I look fat in this suit?\u2019 she growls, in a honking posh voice) is unapologetically loud and clearly the life and soul of any party \u2014 so long as it\u2019s a party that doesn\u2019t go on for too long.\n\nAt one point she goes upstairs and reappears wearing the Back Boris T-shirt she wore during his mayoral campaign. \u2018Of course I kept it,\u2019 she says, and does a little dance.\n\nWe meet at her spacious, four-bedroomed rented home in Huntington Beach, a city south-east of Los Angeles, which she shares with husband Matthew Hickey and their delightful two-year-old daughter Madeleine.\n\nThe couple met in 2016, quickly married and are co-directors of their business which trains cyber security professionals.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been honest with my husband about Boris. He didn\u2019t want to know any details, but it\u2019s an outrage that my husband\u2019s reputation is being dragged through the mud because of all this. He\u2019s an absolute genius and works incredibly hard,\u2019 she says loyally. She complains that the couple\u2019s business \u2018is a tiny start-up that is just trying to survive but it is being dissected like a multi-million-pound corporation\u2019.\n\nThere is a slight air of chaos around her home, with unwashed dishes in the sink and piles of baby toys and clothes strewn around the room. She says she has been under siege since the rumours about her relationship with Boris exploded and that she has let the housework go hang.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t helped that the intrigue has been ratcheted up by photos of her looking buxom in a maid\u2019s outfit and her and Boris standing closely by his mayoral campaign bus.\n\nNot to mention the general hilarity about the fact that she had a dancing pole installed in her top-floor flat in Shoreditch, East London.\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that Boris visited her there on a number of occasions and we hate to be British about this, Jennifer, but we are fascinated by your pole. \u2018Huh? I only had it installed because it\u2019s good exercise. I would turn on YouTube and do workouts on it. Plus, I was renting the flat out on Airbnb. You know, having that pole in the living room got me a lot of renters.\u2019\n\nDid she and Boris ever enjoy it together? \u2018I didn\u2019t pole dance for Boris and Boris has never pole danced for me,\u2019 she shrieks.\n\n\u2018And he wasn\u2019t coming to my home \u2014 he was coming to my office. It\u2019s not unusual for people in start-ups to work from home.\u2019\n\nWhat the stories and raunchy pictures don\u2019t speak of is her intelligence, obvious ambition and entrepreneurial skills. Jennifer is\n\nno dumb blonde. She studied at two American universities and took film-making and economics classes at the American University in Paris.\n\nShe came to the UK seven years ago to launch her career in tech and it was this work that led to her to cross paths with Boris. They met at a British Venture Capital event when she went up and introduced herself.\n\n\u2018He was like \u201cwhoa!\u201d she recalls modestly. \u2018I didn\u2019t tremble. My voice wasn\u2019t shaky.\n\n\u2018I was very passionate about my work and he could tell that right away. Later he told me: \u201cWhen I saw you, I went ooh; she\u2019s different.\u201d He was intrigued by me.\u2019\n\nThe second time they met was on the Conservative battle bus when he was campaigning for his second term as London Mayor. She recalls how Boris climbed to the top deck of the bus, sat directly behind her and started talking.\n\nHe was carrying a collection of short stories by Voltaire and they talked about literature, discovering a mutual passion for Shakespeare.\n\nJennifer has studied his works since she was nine and can reel off huge passages verbatim from King Lear and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\n\nShe does this now, at a roaring Vanessa Redgrave pitch. One wonders how Boris ever got a word in edgeways but somehow he did. She gave him her number, he texted her that night and the rest is history, if only either of them would confirm it. Though it was 2016 when she last saw him, interestingly, she says she has held on to the texts he sent her but stopped answering them when she became pregnant.\n\nIf Boris was such a dear platonic friend, wasn\u2019t it cruel and indeed irrational to drop him so suddenly?\n\n\u2018It was. It\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve thought about in the past three years.\n\n\u2018A friend told me I didn\u2019t owe Boris anything and I remember thinking that, yes, I do. But I had a difficult pregnancy and was ill for much of it. So I put Boris in a box,\u2019 she shrugs.\n\n\u2018Obviously he didn\u2019t care that much. He and his wife are divorcing and he\u2019s got a new girlfriend. If finding somebody to move on with in his life was the goal, I hope he\u2019s found that with Carrie. But it\u2019s sad. I wish that I had talked to him a little more.\u2019\n\nSo what next for this pair of star-crossed absolutely not lovers, to paraphrase their beloved Shakespeare?\n\nIn London, Boris battles on with his Brexit strategy.\n\nIn California, Jennifer is concentrating on rebuilding her life and repairing the reputational damage done to her business. She\u2019s been inundated with offers to go on television and is considering an appearance on Loose Women.\n\nShe\u2019s also hoping to write a book about female entrepreneurship and the things that can trip women up.\n\nShe is definitely the go-to girl for that.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: So did she or didn't she?
