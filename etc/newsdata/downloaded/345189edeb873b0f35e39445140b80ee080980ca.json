It also revealed the dark underbelly of how wealthy families surreptitiously snag a place for their kids in Ivy League colleges. The accused parents allegedly broke the law, but the scandal also exposed the class divide between the wealthy and the millions of Americans who work hard to get a place in college and/or struggle to help their children afford it.\n\nThe \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 and Academy Award-nominated actress, paid $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation for a stranger to sit a college entrance exam for her daughter.\n\nAndrew Lelling, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, described the parents involved in the case as \u201ca catalogue of wealth and privilege.\u201d Parents had allegedly paid between $15,000 and $75,000 per test to a college counselor, William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, to facilitate someone taking a standardized test on their child\u2019s behalf.\n\nOverall, wealthy parents paid Singer $25 million from 2011 to 2019 to bribe coaches and administrators, prosecutors said. One of those parents was Felicity Huffman, the \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d DIS, +0.24% and Academy Award-nominated actress, who had paid $15,000 disguised as a charitable donation for a stranger to sit for a college entrance exam for her daughter. She pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She also deleted her Twitter TWTR, -1.25% account, which focused on the need to empower young women.\n\nAhead of her sentencing Friday, Huffman wrote a letter to Massachusetts Federal Judge Indira Talwani. The 56-year-old mother of two made many heartfelt admissions, writing about her daughter\u2019s learning difficulties and admitting her fears of not being a good enough mother drove her to break the law.\n\n\u201cMy own fears and lack of confidence, combined with a daughter who has learning disabilities often made me insecure and feel highly anxious from the beginning,\u201d she wrote. Huffman said her daughter went to a \u201cvery underfunded\u201d public high school for the performing arts. \u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRead her full letter here.\n\n\u201cBut first let me say, I am concerned that in giving you context it will seem like I am offering you a justification,\u201d she added. \u201cPlease, let me be very clear; I know there is no justification for what I have done. Yes, there is a bigger picture, but ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter because I could have said \u2018No\u2019 to cheating on the SAT scores.\u201d\n\nNowhere did Huffman talk about the young man or woman who would have been deprived of a place in a college due to her employing a stranger to take her daughter Sophia\u2019s SAT.\n\nIf her letter doesn\u2019t offer justification, it leans toward obfuscation. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t and don\u2019t care about my daughter going to a prestigious college. I just wanted to give her a shot at being considered for a program where her acting talent would be the deciding factor. This sounds hollow now, but, in my mind, I knew that her success or failure in theater or film wouldn\u2019t depend on her math skills.\u201d\n\nOf course, cheating on math because she wouldn\u2019t need math later on is not the point. But Huffman\u2019s letter had one salient omission: Nowhere did she talk about the young man or woman who would have been deprived of a place in a college due to her having employed a stranger to take her daughter Sophia\u2019s SAT test. (Huffman said Sophia did not have any knowledge of the cheating.)\n\nBefore the college-admissions scandal, Huffman often wrote about the need to empower young women and girls, and posted a photograph of touring college campuses with her daughter Sophia. In one frequently cited tweet from Aug. 25, 2016, Huffman wrote, \u201cWhat are your best \u2018hacks\u2019 for the back-to-school season?\u201d\n\nOthers have pointed out the real cost of wealthy parents who cheat to get their kids a place at an elite college. In one tweet, John Owen Lowe, son of actor Rob Lowe, posted a photo of his college graduation and wrote: \u201cStill proud of this achievement. Happy for everyone out there who earned their accomplishments ... and really sad for those who were never allowed the opportunity.\u201d", "description": "The \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 actress is due to be sentenced Friday for paying to improve her daughter\u2019s SAT scores.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HJ475_Huffma_ZG_20190513175926.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
