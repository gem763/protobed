He\u2019s attacked investigators as partisans, called the process unfair and prematurely claimed exoneration.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at Trump\u2019s playbook.\n\nSet your own legal standard\n\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION: Early on, Trump argued there was \u201cno collusion\u201d between his campaign and Russia \u2013 a legally vague term that sets a higher bar than whether there was any improper contact.\n\n\u201cDirector Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is \u2018no evidence\u2019 of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, May 8, 2017, referring to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.\n\nUKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has set a similarly high bar, arguing that there was \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d between his administration and the Ukrainian government, setting a higher bar than whether he improperly pressured the country, which has asked for U.S. aid in its conflict with Russia.\n\n\u201cYou will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo!\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, Sept. 24, 2019\n\nClaim exoneration\n\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump cited memos from former FBI Director James Comey, an inspector general\u2019s report, a FISA warrant and charges against Russian hackers that he said exonerated him, even though none did and some were actually quite damning.\n\n\u201cJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, April 19, 2018\n\nUKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has argued that the transcript of his telephone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy rebuffed his critics, even though it showed him asking for an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter after talking about U.S. military aid.\n\n\u201cWill the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should, a perfect call - got them by surprise!\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, Sept. 25, 2019\n\nFlip the script\n\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly argued that not only did Russia not help his campaign, but that it actually tried to help get Hillary Clinton elected, directly contradicting the assessment of the U.S. intelligence community and Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\n\u201cThere was no collusion between us and Russia. In fact, the opposite. Russia spent a lot of money on fighting me.\u201d \u2013 Trump press remarks, Aug. 10, 2017\n\nUKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has argued that not only did he not improperly pressure Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden, but that Joe Biden improperly pushed Ukraine to drop it, even though prosecutors had already halted the investigation a year earlier.\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainian Government just said they weren\u2019t pressured at all during the \u2018nice\u2019 call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That\u2019s the real story!\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, Sept. 22, 2019\n\nRepeat catchphrases\n\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly called the investigation a \u201choax,\u201d any reporting about his campaign \u201cfake news,\u201d and the entire matter a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and \u201cpresidential harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, April 27, 2018\n\nUKRAINE SCANDAL: Trump has used many of the same terms arguing about the current inquiry, adding repeatedly that his call with the Ukrainian president was \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe congratulatory phone call with the Ukrainian President was PERFECT, unless you heard Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff\u2019s fraudulently made up version of the call. This is just another Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, HOAX!\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, Oct. 1, 2019\n\nAttack the investigators\n\nMUELLER INVESTIGATION: Trump repeatedly argued that Comey was a \u201cslimeball,\u201d former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was \u201cdisgraced,\u201d Mueller had a conflict of interest, that his team was full of partisan Democrats and that congressional investigators were \u201cliars and leakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue. The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite.\u201d \u2013 Trump tweet, Nov. 27, 2018", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump is making his case against an impeachment inquiry by relying on the same tricks and tactics he used to fight the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.He\u2019s called it a hoax, fake news and a witch hunt.
