The statement was promptly refuted by the National Weather Service in Birmingham, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others saying that Alabama is not expected to be affected\u2014yet Trump repeated his claim.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe president\u2019s insistence might have surprised weather forecasters, but it\u2019s far from the first time he\u2019s waded into a debate by immediately high-handing the experts. In the course of his presidency, Trump has claimed detailed knowledge about topics as wide-ranging as drones, forest management, horse track conditions and technology.\n\nWe\u2019ve combed Trump\u2019s Twitter feed, interviews and other public statements since he took office. What follows is only a sampling of the striking list of things on which the president is, by his own account, an expert.\n\n\n\n***\n\nAirplanes: \u201cAirplanes are becoming far too complex to fly. Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better.\u201d \u2014March 12, 2019, Twitter\n\nForest management: \u201cThere is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!\u201d \u2014November 10, 2018, Twitter\n\nWater management: \u201cCalifornia wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren\u2019t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading!\u201d \u2014August 6, 2018, Twitter\n\nBasic human technologies: \u201cThe Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else\u2019s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It\u2019s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, & technology.\u201d \u2014December 21, 2018, Twitter\n\nAdvanced human technologies: \u201cHaving a drone fly overhead\u2014and I think nobody knows much more about technology, this type of technology certainly, than I do.\u201d \u2014January 3, 2019, White House briefing\n\nSafety: \u201cI know more about drones than anybody. I know about every form of safety that you can have.\u201d \u2014January 2, 2019, Cabinet meeting\n\nSteam-powered catapults: \u201cYou know the catapult is quite important. So, I said what is this? \u2018Sir, this is our digital catapult system.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to this because we wanted to keep up with modern [technology].\u2019 I said, \u2018You don\u2019t use steam anymore for catapult?\u2019 \u2018No sir.\u2019 I said, \u2018Ah, how is it working?\u2019 \u2018Sir, not good. Not good. Doesn\u2019t have the power. You know the steam is just brutal. You see that sucker going, and steam\u2019s going all over the place. There\u2019s planes thrown in the air.\u2019 It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital? And it\u2019s very complicated, you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out. And I said\u2014and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers. I said, \u2018What system are you going to be?\u2019 \u2018Sir, we\u2019re staying with digital.\u2019 I said, \u2018No you\u2019re not. You going to goddamned steam. The digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money, and it\u2019s no good.\u2019\u201d \u2014May 8, 2017, interview with Time magazine\n\nThe 14th Amendment: \u201cSo-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words \u2018subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u2019 Many legal scholars agree.\u201d \u2014October 31, 2018, Twitter\n\nNewspaper sourcing: \u201cWhen you see \u2018anonymous source,\u2019 stop reading the story, it is fiction!\u201d \u2014August 29, 2018, Twitter\n\nHorse-racing regulation: \u201cThe Kentucky Derby decision was not a good one. It was a rough & tumble race on a wet and sloppy track, actually, a beautiful thing to watch. Only in these days of political correctness could such an overturn occur. The best horse did NOT win the Kentucky Derby - not even close!\u201d \u2014May 5, 2019, Twitter\n\nThe small-truck business: \u201cThe reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go to favorite is that, for many years, Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the \u2018chicken tax.\u2019 If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here.\u201d \u2014November 28, 2018, Twitter\n\nUSPS: \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!\u201d \u2014December 29, 2017, Twitter\n\nJapanese auto-import regulations: \u201cIt\u2019s called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is? That\u2019s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn\u2019t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn\u2019t qualify.\u201d \u2014March 14, 2018, fundraiser in Missouri\n\nThe economy: \u201cI think I know about it better than [the Federal Reserve].\u201d \u2014October 11, 2018, to reporters\n\nThe solar system: \u201cFor all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!\u201d \u2014June 7, 2019, Twitter\n\nWindmills: \u201cHillary wanted to put up wind \u2026 And they say the noise [of windmills] causes cancer.\u201d \u2014April 2, 2019, fundraiser in Washington\n\n\u2026 and again: \u201cIf a windmill is within two miles of your house, your house is practically worthless. They make noise. They\u2019re intermittent. They kill your birds. They break down all the time. You have to replace them every 10 years because they wear out. And they cost a fortune. And they need subsidy. Other than that, they\u2019re quite good.\u201d \u2014August 1, 2019, rally in Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nArticle II: \u201cTake a look at one other thing. It\u2019s a thing called Article II. Nobody ever mentions Article II. It gives me all of these rights at a level that nobody has ever seen before. We don\u2019t even talk about Article II.\u201d \u2014July 12, 2019, interview with reporters", "description": "It\u2019s not just hurricanes.
