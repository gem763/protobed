That is the ultimate goal. But if I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in prison, the one bottom line demand that we have to agree to is that at least I get a fair trial. And that is the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won't provide access to what's called a public interest defense,\u201d Snowden told \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nThe former intelligence analyst, who leaked information about National Security Agency surveillance programs, said he\u2019s not asking for a \u201cparade\u201d or a pardon but that he won\u2019t return from Russia until U.S. officials agree to open the courtroom he would be tried in to the public and allow a jury to consider his motives.\n\n\u201cWhat I'm asking for is a fair trial. And this is the bottom line that any American should require. We don't want people thrown in prison without the jury being able to decide that what they did was right or wrong. The government wants to have a different kind of trial,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey want to use special procedures, they want to be able to close the courtroom, they want the public not to be able to go, know what's going on,\u201d he added.\n\nThe biggest \u201cpoint of contention,\u201d Snowden said, is whether a jury can consider \u201cwhy I did what I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it better for the United States? Did it benefit us or did it cause harm?\u201d he said. \u201cThey don't want the jury to consider that at all. They want the jury strictly to consider whether these actions were lawful or unlawful, not whether they were right or wrong. And I'm sorry, but that defeats the purpose of a jury trial.\u201d\n\nSnowden is promoting his new memoir, \"Permanent Record,\" which is set to be published on Tuesday.", "description": "Edward Snowden said on Monday that his goal is to return home to the U.S., but not until officials agree to terms he considers necessary for a \u201cfair trial.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/snowdenedward_111816getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
