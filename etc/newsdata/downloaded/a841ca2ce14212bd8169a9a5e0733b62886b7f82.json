She was arrested three-and-a-half years ago on spying charges, which she denies.\n\nIt was decided that Gabriella would come back home to the UK so she could start school, and Ratcliffe expressed his hope that one homecoming would \u201cunlock\u201d another.\n\nTimeline Imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran Show Hide Arrest in Tehran Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella. Release campaign begins Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release. Sentenced She is sentenced to five years in jail. Her husband says the exact charges are still being kept a secret. Hunger strike Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health deteriorates after she spends several days on hunger strike in protest at her imprisonment. Appeal fails Iran\u2019s supreme court upholds her conviction. Boris Johnson intervenes Boris Johnson, then Foreign Secretary, tells a parliamentary select committee \"When we look at what [she] was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism\". Four days after his comments, Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returned to court, where his statement is cited in evidence against her. Her employers, the Thomson Reuters Foundation, deny that she has ever trained journalists, and her family maintain she was in Iran on holiday. Johnson is eventually forced to apologise for the \"distress and anguish\" his comments cause the family. Health concerns Her husband reveals that Zaghari-Ratcliffe has fears for her health after lumps had been found in her breasts that required an ultrasound scan, and that she was now \u201con the verge of a nervous breakdown\u201d. Hunt meets husband New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with Richard Ratcliffe, and pledges \"We will do everything we can to bring her home.\" Temporary release She is granted a temporary three-day release from prison. Hunger strike Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on hunger strike again, in protest at the withdrawal of her medical care. Diplomatic protection The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, takes the unusual step of granting her diplomatic protection \u2013 a move that raises her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states. Travel warning The UK upgrades its travel advice to British-Iranian dual nationals, for the first time advising against all travel to Iran. The advice also urges Iranian nationals living in the UK to exercise caution if they decide to travel to Iran. Hunger strike in London Richard Ratcliffe joins his wife in a new hunger strike campaign. He fasts outside the Iranian embassy in London as she begins a third hunger strike protest in prison. Hunger strike ends Zaghari-Ratcliffe ends her hunger strike by eating some breakfast. Her husband also ends his strike outside the embassy.\n\nMoved to mental health ward According to her husband, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was moved from Evin prison to the mental ward of Imam Khomeini hospital, where Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have prevented relatives from contacting her. Zaghari-Ratcliffe's five year old daughter Gabriella, who has lived with her grandparents in Tehran and regularly visited her mother in jail over the last three years, returns to London in order to start school.\n\n\u201cGabriella came back to us late at night, a bit uncertain seeing those she only remembered from the phone,\u201d Ratcliffe said. \u201cNow she is peacefully sleeping next to me. And I am just watching.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long journey to have her home, with bumps right until the end \u2013 and I am grateful to all those at the British embassy and Iranian MFA [foreign ministry] who helped smooth all those last blockages.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOf course, the job is not yet done until Nazanin is home. It was a hard goodbye for Nazanin and all her family. But let us hope this homecoming unlocks another.\u201d\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s MP, Tulip Siddiq, tweeted that although Gabriella had returned home, the fight to release her mother from prison would continue.\n\nTulip Siddiq (@TulipSiddiq) Late last night, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s daughter, Gabriella, came home after more than 1300 days in Iran. She is now reunited with her dad Richard, but her mum remains a hostage in prison in Iran. The fight to #FreeNazanin continues. pic.twitter.com/Uapz3OCaCG\n\nIn a letter smuggled out of Tehran prison and published by the Centre for Human Rights in Iran last week, Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote: \u201cIn the near future my baby will leave me to go with her father and start school in the UK. It will be daunting trip for her travelling and for me left behind, and the authorities who hold me will watch on unmoved at the injustice of separation. That first day of school not for me.\u201d\n\nThe former UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt described the letter as agonising to read, saying: \u201cIf there was ever a moment for Iran to show some humanity it is now. Let this innocent woman who has suffered so much come home.\u201d\n\nIn July, Ratcliffe said his wife had been moved from to the mental ward of Imam Khomeini hospital, where she was chained to a bed and relatives were prevented from contacting her.\n\nShe was returned to Evin prison about five days later, and complained earlier this month to Iranian officers that she had been deprived of her medication, was sometimes kept in solitary confinement and was suffering from severe anxiety.", "description": "Husband of jailed British-Iranian hopes Gabriella\u2019s return \u2018unlocks another\u2019", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b746ac8c37471aeb375714e2f54685021e64c2/0_157_1376_825/master/1376.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=51d5ca0df531c78140f1aad47256b983", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
