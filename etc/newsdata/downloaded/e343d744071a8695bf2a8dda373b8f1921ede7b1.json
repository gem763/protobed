Airlines must be able to evacuate passengers within 90 seconds.\n\nRight now, Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines have some of the most tightly packed seats. Those airlines' \"seat pitch,\" or distance from one seat back to the next, is 28 inches in coach, according to Reuters. That's compared to a 31-inch average for other mainline economy seats.\n\nIn July 2018, the FAA rejected the idea of setting minimum standards for airlines seats and legroom as a safety measure. But Congress was determined to require the FAA to do so.\n\nIn October 2018, Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to create minimum seat standards for pitch, width and length for passenger safety in a year.\n\nMeanwhile in Japan, passengers on Japan Airlines will be able to tell where babies will be seated on the plane when selecting seats in advance.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The size and spacing of airplane seats isn't regulated \u2014 but the amount of time it takes airlines to evacuate passengers is.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Elwel-Airplane.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
