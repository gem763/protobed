They later returned and saved 11 more animals.\n\nThey are still investigating the farm, in south-western Poland, in an attempt to have it closed down.\n\nIt was not clear why dogs were being kept at the farm or whether any had been slaughtered for their fur.\n\nThe owner told the activists he was keeping the dogs to scare off thieves, but it was not clear how they could do that from inside cages, the group said.\n\nSome foxes were seen in the video racing up and down their small cages in distress.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The cramped conditions, and isolation of individuals, makes this industry unavoidably cruel.\n\n\u201cFor animals that are adapted to roam vast distances every day, living in a tight cage is torture.\u201d\n\nFur farms have been banned in the UK since 2000, but it\u2019s estimated that since then Britain has imported more than \u00a3650m worth of animal fur.\n\nOpponents of the trade say Brexit is a chance to ban imports, which was impossible under EU single market rules.\n\nVets, animal-behaviour experts and Springwatch host Chris Packham have called for the UK to stop supporting the trade.\n\nRescuers said at least one fox needed an amputation because of painful foot abscesses.\n\nConnor Jackson, chief executive of Open Cages, said: \u201cWhile it is outrageous to see beloved dogs kept in cages on fur farms, this is a reality for terrified foxes and minks daily \u2013 until they are violently killed and skinned for their fur.\u201d\n\nFur trade chiefs said the farm was not legal and that they had notified prosecutors that the farm may have been conducting illegal breeding.\n\nBut Open Cages said the farm was legal as it was \u201cin the register of the main veterinary inspection\u201d.\n\nFur farms have been accused of causing not just agonising physical injuries and infections that go untreated, but also psychological stress and even cannibalism.\n\nSome of Britain\u2019s most upmarket department stores and fashion websites still sell fur clothing.\n\nThe Independent could not contact the farm, but the Polish Fur Breeders\u2019 Association said it was shocked by the \u201cdisgusting\u201d way animals were treated there.\n\nThe farm owner, an 83-year-old, also kept cats and goats, and was not a member of the association, a spokeswoman said.\n\nDaniel Chmielewski, chairman of the association, said the place had been a fox farm but it was no longer officially registered as such and not subject to state checks.\n\n\u201cWe do not have information about how many animals have been kept on this farm as it is not a functioning fur farm but I assure you local authorities are handling the case, as they do in all cases of animal neglect.\n\n\u201cThere exist no incentives to farm dogs and cats for their fur in Europe. The sale of pelts, as well as farming of dogs and cats for fur, is strictly forbidden by EU law.\u201d", "description": "Dogs and puppies have been found \u201cneglected and starving\u201d locked in outdoor cages at a Polish fur farm, investigators say.
