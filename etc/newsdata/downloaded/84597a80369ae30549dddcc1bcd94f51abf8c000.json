That includes drivers of electric vehicles.\n\nAmerica has crumbling highway infrastructure. Roads and bridges are essential to our daily lives and our nation\u2019s economy. President Trump and Republicans in Congress agree it\u2019s time to fix them.\n\nIn August, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair, unanimously advanced historic legislation to invest in our highways. America\u2019s Transportation Infrastructure Act authorizes $287 billion for the Highway Trust Fund over five years. More than any highway bill Congress has ever passed.\n\nThis legislation will have a real impact. It must be paid for. Drivers of electric vehicles should help cover the cost.\n\nThe electric vehicle market is booming.\n\nAccording the California\u2019s Air Resources Board, year-over-year electric car sales increased every month last year and total electric car sales increased 84 percent from 2017 to 2018.\n\nThe Edison Institute projects over 6 million light-duty electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025.\n\nRight now, none of these vehicles contribute to the Highway Trust Fund, the main fund that is used to fix America\u2019s highways.\n\nDrivers of gas- and diesel-powered vehicles pay into the fund every time they fill their tanks. Electric vehicle drivers completely avoid this user fee.\n\nIf these electric vehicles were contributing to the Highway Trust Fund at a rate comparable to drivers in my home state of Wyoming, it would generate over $17 billion for road maintenance between 2021 and 2029.\n\nI have introduced the Fairness for Every Driver Act to ensure that drivers of all vehicles are helping to maintain our roads.\n\nMy legislation establishes an annual highway user fee for alternative-fuel vehicles that would be comparable to what drivers of gas-powered vehicles pay.\n\nOver the next decade, this new user fee will produce billions of dollars for road maintenance and new projects. It will also help ensure the Highway Trust Fund is solvent for the future.\n\nThe legislation is about fairness for everyone using our roads. It\u2019s also about saving the American taxpayer money.\n\nThirty-five years ago, the federal government began providing subsidies to electric car buyers in order to help support the growing market. Back then, the options for purchasing these cars were very limited and the overall cost of the subsidies was small.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case today. Nearly every automaker is ramping up electric production.\n\nFord, General Motors and Volkswagen have all announced large investments in this market.\n\nLuxury brands like Maserati and Aston Martin have gotten into the game with cars costing more than $85,000.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: Every time one of these electric vehicles is sold in America today, U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for up to $7,500 in subsidies.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2017, the subsidy cost taxpayers an estimated $4.7 billion.\n\nThe American taxpayer shouldn\u2019t be subsidizing people purchasing luxury vehicles. The electric vehicle market is established and here to stay.\n\nThe Fairness for Every Driver Act ends these expensive subsidies.\n\nAccording to the Manhattan Institute, ending this expensive program could save taxpayers up to $20 billion.\n\nInstead of contributing to road maintenance, electric-car buyers are receiving checks from Washington. That needs to stop.\n\nWe can fix our roads and close these electric vehicle loopholes at the same time.\n\nCongress needs to make a serious investment in America\u2019s roads and bridges. Congress needs to pay for it. A good place to start is by asking every driver who uses the roads to pay in.\n\n\u2022 John Barrasso, a Republican senator from Wyoming, is chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
