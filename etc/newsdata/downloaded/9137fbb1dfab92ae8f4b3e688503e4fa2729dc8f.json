SAA mainly operates Airbus aircraft on its passenger routes, while subsidiary Mango Airlines operates Boeing aircraft, he said.\n\nMango Airlines said there would be some delays on flights throughout Tuesday.\n\nComair said that as of 10:15 a.m. local time (0815 GMT) a third of its services had been affected. It said \u201ccorrective action\u201d was needed on some of its aircraft and that it expected its full fleet to be back in operation by Wednesday.\n\nAt 1355 GMT kulula.com\u2019s website showed that five domestic flights on Tuesday afternoon had been rescheduled, one under the kulula.com brand and four under the British Airways name.\n\nFlights earlier in the day were also rescheduled.\n\nComair, whose share price fell 3.4% on Tuesday, operates Boeing aircraft.\n\nTransport Minister Fikile Mbalula appealed for calm at a news conference.\n\n\u201cWe appeal to the public to be patient and be on the lookout for updates from their airlines where there may be delays and cancellations,\u201d Mbalula said. \u201cSafety of our people is paramount.\u201d", "description": "South African Airways (SAA) and other carriers grounded aircraft and canceled domestic flights on Tuesday after South Africa's aviation regulator instructed the loss-making state airline to address problems at its maintenance unit.", "authors": ["Alexander Winning", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443710819&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0T9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
