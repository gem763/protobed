We pored over the entire history of the Strategist and cherry-picked the already cherry-picked things to find the ones we\u2019re most confident about (we\u2019ve been nicknaming it the List of Won\u2019t-Returnables). Here\u2019s how it works: The title of each product is linked to the first Strategist post about it, which you can click for a refresher on why we love it so much. Or click the \u201cShop Now\u201d button to head straight to the retailer and make a purchase. Our picks range from the practical (supersoft bed sheets and warm bathrobes) to the lovably weird (a back-massaging power tool and giant googly eyes) to the particularly right-now (status planters and faux anthurium flowers), so take your time, tool around, and discover what delights you.\n\nUpdate: We\u2019ve refreshed this list to include a few of our favorite gifts in time for Mother\u2019s Day, including eyeglass cleaners recommended by chef Carla Hall, superior noise-canceling headphones, and a CBD body lotion that actually works.", "description": "A greatest-hits collection of the Strategist\u2019s most giftable things that have ever appeared on this website.", "authors": ["The Editors"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/04/03/100s-update/strat-100-lede-2.w1200.h630.jpg"}
