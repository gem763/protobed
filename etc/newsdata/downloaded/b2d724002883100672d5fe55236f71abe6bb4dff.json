U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had asked that he be transferred to the custody of deportation officers, but the sheriff\u2019s department refused, and released him instead.\n\n\u201cWithin a few hours of being released, this illegal alien was back at the home of the rape victim where he was free to re-victimize her and harm other members of the community,\u201d said Marc Moore, director of ICE\u2019s Dallas field office.\n\nHe said deportation officers were able to track Mr. Perez down and he is now in custody awaiting deportation proceedings.\n\nThe county sheriff\u2019s department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incident.\n\nICE says the county adopted its sanctuary policy in the last few months, ending its cooperation with ICE officers who place detainer requests asking to be notified of the impending release of illegal immigrants who\u2019ve been booked into its jails. In some cases, detainers are also used to ask local officials to hold illegal immigrants up to 48 hours for ICE to come pick them up.\n\nICE says it\u2019s a courtesy every department in the country respects for the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies \u2014 but doesn\u2019t always do so in the case of ICE.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that someone who is sworn to uphold the law would find it acceptable to release an alleged rapist who is illegally present in the U.S. back into the community when there are other options available under federal immigration law,\u201d Mr. Moore said.\n\nThe new case comes on the heels of a report in The Washington Times about sanctuary policies in the Seattle area that resulted in the release, multiple times, of an illegal immigrant who now stands accused of a gang-involved murder.\n\nCarlos Daniel Carillo-Lopez was in custody of Bellevue, Washington, police in March, but was released by the city\u2019s contracted jail in defiance of an ICE detainer request. A few weeks later, authorities say, he and fellow gang members killed a friend of his after the friend\u2019s girlfriend posted a Snapchat photo where she was making a rival gang\u2019s signs with her fingers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
