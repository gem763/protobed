There are still some kinks to be worked out in new head coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s offense, but the Packers have to be pleased with where they are.\n\nThe Broncos can\u2019t be pleased. Joe Flacco struggled all day to deal with the Packers\u2019 pass rush, and with Flacco struggling the Broncos tried to make their running backs the focal point of their offense. That had mixed results, with Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman making some solid plays in short yardage but not breaking any long runs.\n\nAt 3-0, the Packers are the class of the NFC North and have to be considered the favorites in the division, with the obvious caveat that there\u2019s still a long way to go. The Broncos, at 0-3, appear set to miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year.", "description": "The Green Bay Packers are undefeated, and the Denver Broncos are winless.
