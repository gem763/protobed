Climate Action Summit in New York.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just because 16-year-old Thunberg has proved herself uniquely able to articulate the terror of being a young person on a warming planet, as evidenced by her ability to turn a personal school strike for climate awareness into a global event with over 4 million participants in the course of one year.\n\nWhat Thunberg also deploys effectively is shame, which she unleashed this morning on the dignitaries gathered in front of her. Even as their invited guest, she refused to let world leaders, who are responsible for much of the international community\u2019s inaction on climate change over the past several decades, off the hook. The resulting raw emotion, despair, and unvarnished anger visible in her face and audible in her voice made her words more powerful than they have ever been.\n\nDuring her address, Thunberg seemed to be feeling the weight of a week of her highest-profile appearances to date, at a congressional hearing, in protests at the Capitol, and at New York\u2019s Youth Climate Strike on Friday. More than that, she seemed to be feeling the weight of hours of speaking politely to adults who have known about what is happening to the world \u2014 and why \u2014 for longer than she has even been alive, and who have made her their champion instead of really doing something about it.\n\nWhen it was her turn to speak to the crowd, which included representatives of over 110 U.N. member states, Thunberg used the refrain \u201chow dare you\u201d to immediately turn the attention on her back onto the powerful people in the crowd. \u201cThis is all wrong,\u201d she began. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.\u201d\n\nShe narrowed her eyes, gestured pointedly, and strained while she read certain parts of her address. \u201cPeople are dying,\u201d she said. \u201cEntire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money, and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?\u201d (Her voice broke at this last part as she seemed to be on the verge of tears.)\n\nThunberg\u2019s critics on the right \u2014 the climate deniers and conservative pundits who made fun of her sailing trip and who have posted disturbing, violent messages about her \u2014 have been widely condemned. But today proved that Thunberg is needed far more urgently among her own supposed allies, who say they believe climate change is real but who have failed to live up to their own promises made at the Paris Climate Accords.\n\n\u201cFor more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you look away?\u201d she asked the delegates at the U.N. \u201cYou say you \u2018hear\u2019 us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I don\u2019t want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that.\u201d", "description": "Swedish teen climate-change activist Greta Thunberg just gave the speech of her life at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/23/23-greta-thunberg-c.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
