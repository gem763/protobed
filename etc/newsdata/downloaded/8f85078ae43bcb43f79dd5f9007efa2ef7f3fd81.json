It was by choice\u2014a choice he made with Vuitton\u2019s womenswear artistic director Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re to stage a fashion show at the TWA Flight Center, the refurbished Eero Saarinen\u2013designed terminal at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport. The occasion was the unveiling of Vuitton\u2019s sixth annual cruise collection, featuring designs intended to arrive in stores during next winter\u2019s chilly doldrums. Last night, Ghesqui\u00e8re sent out \u201980s-inspired haute rockabilly styles, including a dress sequined in homage to the Chrysler Building, for an audience packed with celebrities such as Cate Blanchett, Emma Stone, Michelle Williams, and Julianne Moore.\n\n\u201cIt took a certain amount of audacity to pull it off, because it\u2019s not easy to do a fashion show inside an airport,\u201d says Burke, 62.\n\nThe landmark site is the latest in a list of ultra-luxe Vuitton roadshow locations that includes an Oscar Niemeyer\u2013designed museum in Rio de Janeiro and a John Lautner house in Palm Springs. The historic \u201960s-era terminal has been closed for 18 years, and last night\u2019s event marked a glittering revival before it opens to the public next week as the site of a new retro-inspired hotel.\n\nThe high-profile event is also a key part of Burke\u2019s strategy as he tries to best last year\u2019s revenue total for Vuitton\u2014reportedly close to $12 billion. The brand offers leather goods, accessories, men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothing, perfume, fine jewelry and home design in over 460 stores worldwide, all without any standard vendor tools like wholesaling, licensing, end-of-season sales\u2014and certainly no duty-free shops. That figure is higher than those of rivals Herm\u00e8s and Gucci. (Louis Vuitton does not comment on figures.)\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t very often disclose it, and as Bernard [Arnault] said, you\u2019ll have to wait until we hit $20 billion for the next time [we do],\u201d says Burke.\n\nHe describes himself as co-managing the brand with Arnault. Burke began working with Bernard\u2019s father, Jean, as an intern, and after graduating from the elite French business school EDHEC in 1980, he joined LVMH in 1986. Last year, LVMH had a record $53.5 billion in revenue, driven in large part by the success of Louis Vuitton. He and Arnault have no intention of slowing down, especially in a world where luxury market share is determined by such disparate elements as ultra-high-net worth individuals, social media influencers, international currency fluctuations, digital saturation, celebrity endorsements and real estate footprints.\n\n\u201cThe difficult part is playing between the timely part of the business versus the timeless part of the business,\u201d Burke says. \u201c[The] cruise [show] allows us to tell a consistent story. If you just go from fashion week to fashion week, there are a lot of people who burn out.\u201d\n\nModels walk the runway during the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2020 Fashion Show at TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport on May 8, 2019 in New York City.

It was also just days after the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s brand-crammed Costume Institute Gala where Ghesqui\u00e8re appeared alongside so-called \u201cFriends of the House,\u201d celebrities decked out in Louis Vuitton.\n\n\u201cThe Met is the pinnacle of our business\u2026other companies have different goals, but we want to show we are relevant in extreme fashion,\u201d says Burke. He points out that many of the red-carpet styles are reinterpretations of ready-to-wear looks, thereby benefiting sales, albeit in limited quantities. Conversely, if a celebrity \u201cwore a [one-of-a-kind] high jewelry necklace on those steps...you will have a very hard time selling it. Because the client of that $1 million piece of jewelry wants to be the only person who has it.\u201d\n\nCall all this whatever you want, just don\u2019t call it marketing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do marketing,\u201d says Burke. \u201cShow a product, pitch it heavily\u2014that\u2019s fast-moving consumer goods, that\u2019s not our business.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cIn our parlance, we call that, \u2018Don\u2019t burn the goods.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also refuses to take what he calls \u201ca fashion approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe enter everything as a trade and want to be a relevant player in that trade,\u201d says Burke, who oversees 20,000 employees worldwide. He points to the perfumes, launched in 2016. \u201cThe world does not need another perfume. If you are going to exist in that realm, you are going to do something different. We tried to come up with a unique model.\u201d All of the scents, which start at $250 and are contained in matching bottles meant to convey a sense of timeless consistency, have been developed by legendary perfumer Jacques Cavallier Belletrud, and are sold in only 250 global Louis Vuitton stores.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do focus groups, we don\u2019t survey them, we don\u2019t do blind-tests,\u201d Burke says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fashion-driven\u2014that business model went out a long time ago.\n\nIn this spirit, he says that for the time-being, he will not be embarking on any new product categories and that Vuitton will be abstaining from brand collaborations following 2017\u2019s much-hyped dalliance with cult streetwear brand Supreme. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need Supreme,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had needed Supreme, I would have done $1 billion, I would have done it for a year. But we sold out after three weeks. Our entire model is sustainable growth.\u201d\n\nHe has found that products by his recently appointed menswear artistic director, Virgil Abloh, can sell even faster than streetwear collaborations. Meanwhile, rumors of a rivalry between Abloh and Ghesqui\u00e8re have been swirling. \u201cLouis Vuitton is too big for any singular individual, whether on the management side or the design side,\u201d says Burke. \u201cThey are very respectful of each other and each one knows that the other one is different. They are engaging Vuitton from different vantage points: one is from a feminine, couture side, and the other one is from a masculine design side.\u201d\n\nHe compares Abloh to the late Karl Lagerfeld (whom Burke worked with at Fendi), and sees Abloh and Ghesqui\u00e8re as synergistic personalities.\n\n\u201cThey are not butterflies\u2014they don\u2019t go from one season to the next,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth are extremely attuned to the design world, and they have a very long-term view of their aesthetic...When I worked with John Galliano, every season he would invent a new woman.\u201d He keeps in close contact with both designers with regular lunch dates and phone calls. \u201cWe don\u2019t go through briefs,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship of trust. Each side understands that they need the other one.\u201d\n\nThey also both understand fashion\u2019s new landscape, wherein social media has pried open its gilded gates. \u201cEveryone wants to be behind-the-scenes,\u201d Burke says. But \u201cwhen I started in this business, photographers were not allowed in runway shows or showrooms, because everyone was paranoid that that was how you got knocked off.\u201d\n\nThough he welcomes the shift, he has had to cope with high-profile fakes, including logo\u2019d tracksuits worn by music stars Bad Bunny and Billie Eilish during recent concert appearances at the Coachella music festival. Burke doesn\u2019t rule out legal action against the bootlegs\u2019 creator, Imran Moosvi, who works under the name Imran Potato, but he says that \u201cLawsuits are not a good solution\u2014this is the ransom of success.\u201d He points to the early \u201990s unauthorized Vuitton renditions created by Harlem tailor Dapper Dan. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put the toothpaste back in the tube,\u201d Burke says. \u201cMy typical attitude is to leave it up to Nicolas and Virgil.\u201d\n\nMoosvi commented via text message, \u201cWe should collab\u201d\u2014referring to the idea of jointly creating products with Vuitton.\n\nBurke also has a counterintuitive attitude about the trending debate over online retail versus brick-and-mortar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s irrelevant for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if someone asked me what\u2019s the percentage of sales using Visa versus MasterCard. I\u2019m not in the business of being a payment provider. I\u2019m in the business of selling experiences and objects.\u201d He says that he views his clientele as \u201c100% online and 100% brick and-mortar.\u201d\n\nAsk him about what moves should be made at Fendi following the death of Lagerfeld, the brand\u2019s longtime women\u2019s wear designer, and Burke parries, \u201cBernard is the only one I\u2019ve told what I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy other day job was fixing companies\u2014everytime Bernard bought something, I was sent in to fix it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we bought Dior, it had a broken business model based on licensing, so we had to fix that. Fendi was based on uncontrolled wholesale, so we had to fix that. When I went the first time around to Louis Vuitton back in the \u201990s, we had not been able to position it as a European luxury brand, so we needed to fix that. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter 35 years in the luxury business, I know how difficult it is to fix things. So everything I do now at Vuitton is making sure that after me, nobody has to fix anything.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of Louis Vuitton\u2019s cruise show, CEO Michael Burke talks about how to sustain global growth, how Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re and Virgil Abloh co-exist and why Vuitton doesn\u2019t need another Supreme collaboration any time soon", "authors": ["Elisa Lipsky-Karasz", "Elisa.Lipsky-Karasz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-72972/social", "published_at": "2019-05-09"}
