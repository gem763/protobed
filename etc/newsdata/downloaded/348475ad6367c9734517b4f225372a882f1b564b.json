Human Rights Council", "language": "en", "text": "Venezuela and regional rival Brazil beat out Costa Rica for the two Latin American seats up for election. Costa Rica had declared its candidacy only this month in an effort to deny Venezuela a three-year term, but the support of China, Russia, Cuba and other allies gave the socialist state the win.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe celebrate, once again, the Bolivarian diplomacy of peace at the U.N.,\u201d Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said after the vote. \u201cThis victory is historic, since we faced a ferocious campaign.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhile the government celebrated Thursday, opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 accused it of killing a member of his party. Edmundo Rada, a 42-year-old former councilman from the eastern Caracas slum of Petare, was found shot twice in the neck, a bag covering his face and half his body burned.\n\n\u201cOn the same day that the U.N. permits a dictatorship like Maduro\u2019s to occupy a seat bathed in blood,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said, \u201cthe regime produces a human rights violation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGuaid\u00f3 called for an \u201cimpartial international commission\u201d to investigate this and other killings. Venezuela\u2019s Communications Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJulio Borges, the foreign relations representative for opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, said Maduro \u201cmortgaged everything\u201d to win the seat.\n\n\u201cBut what he doesn\u2019t know is that this maneuvering won\u2019t let him hide his crimes,\u201d Borges said. \u201cElected democracies in this body will increasingly isolate the dictatorship and will expose its human rights violations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe General Assembly elected 14 members to new terms Thursday. Countries can serve up to two consecutive terms before withdrawing for at least a year.\n\nAD\n\nHuman rights watchdogs had urged U.N. members to reject the Venezuelan bid.\n\n\u201cWith the seat, Venezuela will try to undermine scrutiny of its abuses and the abuses of its allies,\u201d said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cThe council\u2019s fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry have done outstanding work. The votes on some issues can be close, so we don\u2019t need countries like Venezuela who try to undermine the good work.\u201d\n\nThe council promotes human rights and investigates alleged violations. It\u2019s distinct from but works closely with the U.N. high commissioner for human rights.\n\nHigh Commissioner Michelle Bachelet has painted a bleak picture of Maduro\u2019s Venezuela. In three reports this year, she documented arbitrary detentions, torture and killings. In July, she said corruption and underinvestment had violated Venezuelans\u2019 right to an adequate standard of living.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaduro, who succeeded the late socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, claimed victory last year in elections widely viewed as fraudulent. The United States and other nations recognize Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s rightful president, but Maduro remains in control of the military, police and intelligence services, and talks between the sides have ended in a stalemate.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo called Venezuela\u2019s election to the council \u201ctruly tragic.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is a harsh blow not just against the victims of the Venezuelan regime, but also against the cause of human rights around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Human Rights Council ought to be a protector and defender of human rights of people the world over. It should be speaking out about the daily abuses of the former Maduro regime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVenezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab announced the release of 24 political prisoners Thursday as part of an agreement with minority opposition parties with whom the government has continued to talk. The legal nonprofit Foro Penal has counted nearly 450 political prisoners in the country.\n\nMariano de Alba, a Venezuelan lawyer based in Washington, predicted Maduro would use the win to show his government \u201cstill has support and is recognized by a majority of the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in practice, it\u2019s not the end of the world for the opposition.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Council has a long history of members with problematic records. China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia are current members, Libya and Sudan also won seats Thursday, and Venezuela served as recently as last year.\n\nThe United States quit the panel last year over what the Trump administration said was its bias against Israel. President Trump said it was a \u201cmassive source of embarrassment.\u201d Pompeo called it an \u201cexercise in shameless hypocrisy,\u201d with \u201csome of the world\u2019s most serious offenders sitting in it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn July, Cuba led an effort to pass a resolution rejecting \u201cunilateral and coercive\u201d sanctions against Venezuela. It succeeded.", "description": "The government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro joins China, Cuba and Saudi Arabia on the 47-member panel.
