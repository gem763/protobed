He was 78.\n\n\u201cWillie Brown was a true Raider and one of the best cornerbacks that ever played the game,\u201d Hall of Fame coach John Madden said. \u201cIt was a comfort to a coach to be able to have Willie Brown in the defensive backfield. Willie was a good guy, a team captain, and a true Raider from the day he joined our team in 1967, until he passed away today. He will be missed by me and the entire Raiders organization.\u201d\n\nAl Davis acquired Brown for the Raiders in a trade from Denver in 1967 in one of the best moves he made during his Hall of Fame career running the Raiders.\n\nBrown went on to have a brilliant career with Oakland, highlighted by his 75-yard interception return for a touchdown against Minnesota that helped the Raiders win their first Super Bowl following the 1976 season.\n\n\u201cHis legendary performance on the field changed the way the cornerback position was played and his valued guidance as a coach, mentor and administrator permeated the organization and touched countless individuals both on and off the field,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cWillie\u2019s loss will leave a tremendous void, but his leadership and presence will always be a major part of the fabric of the Raiders Family.\u201d\n\nBrown was one of the game\u2019s best lockdown cornerbacks and fit perfectly in Davis\u2019 preferred bump-and-run style of defense on the Raiders. He intercepted 54 passes, was a first-team All-Pro five times in the AFL and NFL and made the Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 1984.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t play DB in college,\u201d Brown told ESPN for a story in 2013. \u201cI just knew that if you beat the hell out of the receivers coming off the line of scrimmage, that was going to affect whether they could catch the ball or not.\u201d\n\nHis most memorable play came in the Super Bowl against the Vikings on Jan. 9, 1977. With the Raiders leading the game 26-0 in the fourth quarter, Brown intercepted a pass from Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton and raced for the score, prompting the iconic radio call from Raiders announce Bill King: \u201cHe looks and throws \u2026 intercepted by the Oakland Raiders Willie Brown at the 30, 40, 50 \u2026 he\u2019s going all the way! \u2026 Old Man Willie! \u2026 Touchdown Raiders!\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a player, coach, and executive, Willie served as a tremendous ambassador for the Raiders and football for more than 50 years,\u201d Commissioner Roger Goodell said. \u201cHe will forever be immortalized by NFL Films with his iconic 75-yard interception return in Super Bowl XI as he ran straight into the camera and our imaginations. After a remarkable 16-year Pro Football Hall of Fame career that he began as an undrafted free agent, Willie went on to become a Raiders coach and later a member of the team\u2019s front office. Willie lived the Raiders\u2019 motto \u201cCommitment to Excellence\u201d with integrity and touched the lives of hundreds of NFL players with his wisdom and wit.\u201d\n\nBrown retired two seasons later. He was an assistant coach for the Raiders from 1979-88, was head coach at Long Beach State in 1991, coached at Jordan High School in 1994 and returned to the Raiders when they moved back to Oakland in 1995 as director of staff development.\n\nBrown was a regular presence around the team during that time, working with defensive backs like Rod Woodson, Charles Woodson and Nnamdi Asomugha and in more recent years announcing the team\u2019s picks during the annual NFL draft.\n\n\u201cGoing to miss you Willie! I\u2019ll never forget when you called my name on that stage to welcome me into the Raider family 4 life! Prayers to his family,\u201d quarterback Derek Carr wrote on Twitter.\n\nOwner Mark Davis called Brown \u201cone of the greatest to ever play the game.\u201d He thanked Brown for how he treated his mother and Al Davis\u2019 widow, Carol Davis. Mark Davis said Brown always helped Carol Davis up and down the stairs on the plane, joined her for dinners on the road and came to her birthday and Mother\u2019s Day dinners each year.\n\n\u201cIt was Willie who was her best friend,\u201d Mark Davis said. \u201cWe loved and will miss you Willie.\u201d\n\nBrown played his college ball at Grambling under the great coach Eddie Robinson. He was undrafted after leaving school and was cut by the Houston Oilers in his first training camp in 1963.\n\nHe then signed with Denver and became a starter midway through his rookie year and was an AFL All-Pro in his second season.\n\nBut his greatest moments came with the Raiders.\n\n\u201cWillie Brown was the epitome of the Raiders motto of \u2018commitment to excellence\u2019 that was integral to the team\u2019s sustained success,\u201d Hall of Fame President David Baker said. \u201cHe embodied virtues like passion, integrity, perseverance and always led by example. His character, on and off the field, made all those around him better.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Hall of Fame cornerback Willie Brown, who provided the iconic play of the Oakland Raiders' first Super Bowl title, died on Tuesday.
