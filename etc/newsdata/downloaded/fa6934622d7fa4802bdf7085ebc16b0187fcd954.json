As the focus of the Ukraine-Gate probe falls on the so-called \u201cThree Amigos\u201d \u2014 Perry, Kurt Volker, and Gordon Sondland \u2014 Perry has decided to say adios to Trump. Bloomberg suspects that Trump\u2019s attempt to shift blame to Perry over the July 25th call to Volodymyr Zelensky might have provided the catalyst for his resignation:\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry notified President Donald Trump on Thursday that he\u2019ll leave the post this year. Perry, one of the administration\u2019s original cabinet secretaries, enjoyed good rapport with Trump. The former Texas governor has recently come under scrutiny in the House impeachment inquiry over his discussions with Ukraine. \u2026 Perry had avoided the missteps that led to the downfall and exit of other cabinet members including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. But as the impeachment investigation into White House interactions with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expanded, some of that good will seemed to disappear. Trump earlier this month blamed Perry for the July 25 call with Zelenskiy that led to the whistle-blower complaint that spurred the probe, telling Republican lawmakers it was his energy secretary\u2019s idea.\n\nThe recognition of Perry\u2019s professionalism seems out of place here, but it\u2019s at least accurate. Perry has been quietly effective, a rare combination in Trump\u2019s Cabinet, even though his nomination was greeted with considerable skepticism by the media and Democrats when Trump made it. One reason Perry \u201cavoided the missteps\u201d is because he had decades of experience in public service and knew where the potential missteps were.\n\nThis belated recognition of Perry\u2019s agility and success seems less like a congratulatory note and more like an attempt to use Perry to build a narrative against Trump, however. What do Pruitt and Zinke have to do with the Ukraine story or with Perry himself? Literally nothing, that\u2019s what, except to extend an orange man bad theme.\n\nAnyway, Trump\u2019s blame for the Zelensky call might be one reason Perry has decided that it\u2019s time to leave public service. It might also be the subpoenas and the administration\u2019s insistence on defiance, too:\n\nEnergy Secretary Rick Perry faces a subpoena deadline Friday to turn over documents relating to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a day after he offered his resignation. \u2026 \u201cThe House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have, and our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now,\u201d Perry said on Fox Business in a Wednesday morning interview. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow the lead of my counsel on that.\u201d\n\nThere may not be much to hear from Perry anyway. Sondland\u2019s prepared statement prior to his testimony declared Perry fully aligned with his own goals of working to support Ukraine and dealing with a chronic corruption problem, without any knowledge of what Giuliani\u2019s agenda might otherwise be. Perry told the Wall Street Journal that Giuliani had insisted that overall corruption was Trump\u2019s issue, not anyone in particular:\n\nPerry said in an Oct. 16 Wall Street Journal interview that he had called Giuliani to understand Trump\u2019s concerns about Ukraine. \u201cAnd as I recall the conversation, he said, \u2018Look, the president is really concerned that there are people in Ukraine that tried to beat him during this presidential election,\u2019\u201d Perry told the Wall Street Journal. \u201c\u2018He thinks they\u2019re corrupt and\u2026that there are still people over there engaged that are absolutely corrupt.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then Perry won\u2019t have much to add to the Democrats\u2019 march toward impeachment. The White House and its counsel will control the documents he leaves behind at the DoE, so that\u2019s one headache Perry won\u2019t have regardless. He might have more to say in a Senate trial, assuming it gets that far, but by then he\u2019ll be on his own and out of the arena.\n\nSo who will replace Perry at Energy? Trump had claimed that Perry had been planning his exit for a while, before Ukraine-Gate erupted at all, and that Trump would reveal Perry\u2019s replacement at last night\u2019s rally:\n\n\u201cWe already have his replacement,\u201d Trump told reporters on his way to a campaign stop in Texas. \u201cRick has done a fantastic job. But it was time.\u201c \u2026 Trump did not state who Perry\u2019s replacement would be, saying he planned to announce it at the rally Thursday night. \u2026 \u201cRick and I have been talking for six months,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cIn fact, I thought he might go a bit sooner. But he\u2019s got some very big plans. He\u2019s going to be very successful. We have his successor, we\u2019ll announce it pretty soon.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, it appears that the announcement has been delayed. Politico thought it might be Perry\u2019s deputy Dan Brouillette, a former Ford Motors exec. Brouillette would at least be readily available for the job, and likely wouldn\u2019t face much real opposition in the Senate. However, Democrats might take the opportunity to ask a few Ukraine-related questions during a confirmation hearing, unless the impeachment and trial are completed by that time.\n\nThe Trump administration will miss Perry and his quiet approach to the job. Perhaps they should have been satisfied with that rather than putting him in the lead of a politically charged diplomatic mission.", "description": "Wonderful thing, subpoenas.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Perry-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
