In a rematch of the opener, Gerrit Cole goes for Houston after losing for the first time since May.\n\nVisiting teams have won the first four games for the first time since 1996, when the Yankees broke the pattern in Game 6 against Atlanta to take the title.\n\nGame 6 will be Tuesday night in Houston, when the Astros lose their road-field advantage.\n\nYuli Gurriel also drove in a run in the first as Houston strung together four singles in a seven-pitch span for a 2-0 lead against Patrick Corbin. Robinson Chirinos homered for the second straight day, a two-run drive that boosted the lead to 4-0 in the fourth.\n\nFans started leaving in the seventh, when the Astros sent 10 batters to the plate and battered the bullpen. Bregman, who began the night in a 1-for-13 Series slide, had the big blow, driving a low, inside fastball from Fernando Rodney into the left field stands of the ballpark where was the All-Star Game MVP in 2018. He held his bat high as he slowly walked out of the batter's box, then took nearly 30 seconds to circle the bases.\n\nOrange-clad Houston fans in the right field upper deck chanted \"Let's go Astros!\" as Nationals fans were silenced. Wild-card Washington lost consecutive games for the first time since Sept. 13-14 against Atlanta.\n\nStarting pitchers were the talk of the Series coming in, with Washington's Stephen Strasburg, Scherzer and Corbin combining for 12 All-Star selections and three Cy Young Awards. The baseball cards of Houston's Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke shine with 17 All-Star picks, two Cy Youngs and one MVP.\n\nBut there were just five 1-2-3 innings by starters in the first three games, and the most consecutive outs were by the Nationals' An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, who retired seven straight in Game 3.\n\nUrquidy, a 24-year-old right-hander, exceeded them all.\n\nNot bad for a TBA.\n\nUrquidy wasn't even announced as Houston's starter until after Game 3, with Astros manager AJ Hinch hoping to piece together innings any way he could.\n\nUrquidy began the season at Double-A Corpus Christi, was bumped up to Triple-A Round Rock in mid-May and made his major league debut in July. He faced the Nationals in just his 12th big league appearance, joining Fernando Valenzuela (1981) and Jaime Garc\u00eda (2011) as the only Mexican starting pitchers in Series history.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
