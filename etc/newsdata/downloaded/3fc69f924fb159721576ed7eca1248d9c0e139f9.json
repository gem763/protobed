The late congressman, who on Thursday became the first black lawmaker to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol, was known for battling perceived abuses of power by the Trump administration, and as Oversight chairman had played a role in the ongoing impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump.\n\nIn remarks punctured with applause from the audience, Clinton drew standing cheers when she compared Cummings with the Old Testament prophet for whom he was named, noting that he \u201che stood against the corrupt leadership\u201d of biblical figures, an apparent reference to his role in battling the Trump administration.\n\nAt the beginning of her remarks, Clinton thanked the constituents of his Baltimore congressional district for sharing their beloved congressman \u201cwith our country and the world\u201d and praised his much-lauded oratorical style, noting that \u201clike the prophet, our Elijah could call down fire from heaven.\u201d\n\nBut she also portrayed Cummings as frequently rising above the political fray, noting that \"even his political adversaries recognized that it wasn't really about politics for our Elijah,\" as cameras cut to Republican lawmakers in attendance at the service.\n\n\"He had little tolerance for those who put party ahead of country or partisanship above truth,\" she added. \"But he could find common ground with anyone willing to seek it with him. And he liked to remind all of us that you can't get so caught up in who you are fighting that you forget what you are fighting for.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/47/3a/1257d64c4c4eb98f9da247c257fa/hillarycummings.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
