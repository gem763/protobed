That's the same region that was decimated earlier this month when Hurricane Dorian swept through the region as a monster Category 5 storm, killing at least 50 people.\n\nThe Abacos, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama Island and New Providence can expect tropical storm conditions sometime within the next 36 hours, NHC said. The \"disturbance\" \u2014 named \"potential tropical cyclone nine\" \u2014 could produce total rain accumulations of 2 to 4 inches through Sunday over the Bahamas. Isolated maximum amounts could total 7 inches in the northwest and central Bahamas.\n\nForecasters say the disturbance is expected to move toward the northwest near 8 mph over the next two days and could turn into a tropical depression or a tropical storm. NHC said the system is packing maximum sustained winds near 30 mph and is anticipated to move across the northwestern Bahamas on Friday.\n\nForecasters say the disturbance could also bring tropical-storm-force winds and rainfall to portions of the Florida east coast this weekend.\n\nThe government of the Bahamas has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for the northwestern Bahamas (excluding Andros Island) and tropical storm conditions are expected within the warning area by late Friday.

While power has been restored to much of Grand Bahama, the electrical grid around Abaco's largest city was destroyed, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA senior administration official told CBS News on Wednesday that the Trump administration will not be granting protected status to people fleeing the destruction of the Bahamas.\n\nIt's something the Trump administration had said was a possibility, as the White House seeks to restrict the flow of immigrants into the country.\n\n\"The Bahamians impacted by Hurricane Dorian are facing a humanitarian crisis and the American government, international partners and private organizations continue to support them with aid and services,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"At this time we do not plan to invoke Temporary Protected Status for those currently in the United States.\"\n\nCaroline Linton, Kathryn Watson and Fin Gomez contributed to this report.", "description": "\"Potential tropical cyclone nine\" could produce 7 inches in northwest and central Bahamas and some rainfall on Florida's east coast", "authors": ["Peter Martinez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/785dd6d4-5af6-4265-aeb4-e3b570c1392e/thumbnail/1200x630/38d63c52f7da72718f9bab0f6ff22a60/potential-tropical-cyclone-nine-advisory.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
