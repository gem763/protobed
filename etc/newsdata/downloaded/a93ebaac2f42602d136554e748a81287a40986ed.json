Trysta Krick reacts to all the biggest games and moments from a wild weekend in the NFL. USA TODAY\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster's reaction said it all.\n\nWith Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph motionless on the Heinz Field turf, all the wideout could do was drop to his knees and try and comfort his teammate.\n\nThe rest of the Steelers were left with a similar helpless feeling. Not too long ago, they feared for Ryan Shazier's ability to walk again when he was carted off the field and doctors initially anticipated paralysis.\n\nLuckily for Rudolph, who suffered a concussion, the second-year player was able to rest at home Sunday night after he took a helmet-to-helmet shot from Baltimore Ravens safety Earl Thomas in the third quarter of an eventual 26-23 overtime loss.\n\nI love the heart JuJu has.. he broke down after seeing Mason Rudolph get taken out..\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t care what people say about him, I\u2019m happy they he is our WR1!\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/LnFPwA8DhG \u2014 Steel Faithful (@Steel_Faithful) October 6, 2019\n\n\"His eyes were open and he was breathing, but he wasn\u2019t there,\" said offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva, who immediately signaled to the Steelers bench for medical attention, per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \"He wasn\u2019t moving. I knew it was a medical emergency.\"\n\nRudolph, 24, walked off the field under the assistance of teammates and trainers, but the moments he spent on the ground were agonizing for offensive lineman David DeCastro.\n\n\"You\u2019re just waiting, waiting, waiting for him to get up,\" DeCastro told the Post-Gazette. \"It took a little longer than I expected. The seconds turn into minutes and the minutes turn into longer. Your stomach just drops. You feel sick.\"\n\nSteelers linebacker Bud Dupree didn't see the hit, but said Rudolph looked \"lifeless\" on the ground.\n\n\"We love Mason. I know I love Mason,\" he told the Post-Gazette. \"We\u2019re real close. When stuff like that happens, it makes a trigger go off in your brain. You\u2019ve got to control yourself.\"\n\nThomas defended his actions on the hit, as did Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, who told reporters after the game he was \"absolutely certain\" there was no intent on the safety's part.", "description": "Pittsburgh Steelers players who saw Mason Rudolph go down Sunday were reminded of Ryan Shazier's brutal injury two seasons ago.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
