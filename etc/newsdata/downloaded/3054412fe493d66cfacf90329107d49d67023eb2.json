For one son going to Benidorm, it was the most convenient way to let his parents know he arrived safely in Spain.\n\nBut sadly for Jim Green, 66, it took 28 years for the note to be sent to his parents\u2019 home in Braintree, Essex.\n\nThe then-39-year-old had written it in September 1991 and expected that it would get to them as soon as possible.\n\nNow living in his parents\u2019 former home, Jim was stunned to receive the postcard last week.\n\nThe letter, dated September 12, 1991, read: \u2018To Mum and Dad. Had a good flight over. Everything\u2019s ok. Good hotel, weather etc. Weather has been very hot. Hope cats are ok. Must close now, love Jim.\u2019\n\nThe postcard arrived on Thursday morning, 17 October while Jim was watching TV. Unfortunately, his parents have since passed so couldn\u2019t share his surprise at the discovery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim explained: \u2018I picked up the letter and my first thought was \u201cwho is in Benidorm?\u201d Then I looked at the date and realised it was 28 years late! I was amazed!\n\n\u2018Then I realised that I had written it to tell my parents I had arrived to Benidorm safely.\u2019\n\nThis postcard was written on in 1991 (Picture: James Linsell-Clark/ SWNS)\n\nJim explained that he would enjoy travelling when he was younger and would send postcards to his parents.\n\nThough he can\u2019t remember writing this one, he presumes it was sent quite early on in his Spanish travels.\n\n\u2018With these kind of things, you always say it\u2019s a great holiday but actually it wasn\u2019t good at all!\u2019 he recalled.\n\nJim\u2019s mum Winifred, died five years ago and his father, Christopher, died in 1997.\n\nJim added: \u2018My dad would have just said: \u201cWell that\u2019s just the post for you!\u201d\n\n\u2018They never really went abroad on holiday, they used to go to the seaside at Clacton or Maldon or go on coach trips. I think at the time there weren\u2019t many people that went away for holidays.\n\n\u2018I suppose it gave them an idea of what Benidorm looked like.\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s hope the cats were okay (Picture: James Linsell-Clark/ SWNS)\n\nGenerations of Jim\u2019s family have lived in the Essex neighbourhood of Finchingfield, going back as far as the mid 1800s.\n\nJim lived with his parents before taking over the tenancy of the family house after his mother died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the surprise delivery certainly put on a smile on Jim\u2019s face, he is still none the wiser as to why it appeared on his doormat so late.\n\nHe added: \u2018I don\u2019t know why it arrived after this length of time. Whether it got lost over here or whether it got lost over here, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m still trying to figure out why the delay was that long, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know what really happened. I think it would be pretty hard to trace it back.\u2019\n\nThe postcard, which has pictures of sunny Benidorm on the front, now takes pride of place on his mantlepiece next to a Victorian clock owned by Jim\u2019s grandfather.\n\nA spokesman for Royal Mail said: \u2018It is difficult to speculate what may have happened to this item of mail, but it is likely that it was put back into the postal system by someone recently, rather than it being lost or stuck somewhere.\n\n\u2018Royal Mail regularly checks all its delivery offices and clears its processing machines daily. Once an item is in the postal system then it will be delivered to the address on the card.\u2019\n\nMORE: Woman finds postcards sent to her grandparents in the 1930s on eBay\n\nMORE: From exploring Mount Fitz Roy to sending postcards from the world\u2019s southernmost city: how to spend a whirlwind 15-day tour of Patagonia\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Sadly for Jim Green, 66, it took 28 years for the note to be sent to his parents' home in Braintree, Essex.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91438215_1571825091.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
