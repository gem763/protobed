This coordinated effort to try to destroy me and people close to me is despicable and will not succeed,\u201d she said. \u201cI, like many women who have faced attacks like this before, am stronger than those who want me to be afraid.\"\n\nThe allegations against Hill were first raised in the conservative publication RedState.org. That publication reported that Hill had an affair with her legislative director, Graham Kelly. The relationship was purportedly uncovered by Hill's husband, Kenny Heslep. The couple is in the midst of an acrimonious divorce, and there is no proof that an improper relationship with Kelly \u2014 who also worked on Hill's campaign \u2014 occurred.\n\nNeither Kelly nor Heslep responded to requests for comment.\n\nRedState also published a nude photo of Hill and alleged that she and Heslep were both romantically involved in a consensual relationship with a female campaign staffer in her 20s. Hill identifies as bisexual.\n\nIn her statement, Hill vehemently denied any improper relationship with Kelly. Hill said U.S. Capitol Police are now investigating where the nude photo came from and how it was published.\n\n\"Intimate photos of me and another individual were published by Republican operatives on the internet without my consent,\" Hill said in her statement. \"I have notified Capitol Hill police who are investigating the situation and potential legal violations of those who posted and distributed the photos, and therefore will have no further comment on the digital materials.\"\n\nHill said the charge that she was romantically involved with Kelly was untrue: \"Allegations that I have been involved in a relationship with Mr. Kelly are absolutely false. I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties.\"\n\nHill, who is a freshman representative in Democratic leadership and vice chair of the Oversight Committee, said she intends to remain in Congress.\n\n\"This smear campaign will not get in the way of the work I am doing every day to move our district and our country forward. I am truly grateful for the outpouring of support I have received from colleagues and constituents alike, and I know we will get through this together.\n\nUnder House rules, members \"may not engage in a sexual relationship with any employee of the House who works under the supervision of the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, or who is an employee of a committee on which the Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner serves.\"\n\nSources close to Hill and Democratic leadership aides dismiss the Oct. 18 report in RedState as coming from GOP operatives in California seeking to hurt the freshman lawmaker politically.\n\nHill trounced Rep. Steve Knight (R-Calif.) by 9 points in 2018. Her district in the northern exurbs of Los Angeles was once reliably Republican \u2014 it includes the late President Ronald Reagan's library \u2014 but has trended away from the party in recent years. Hillary Clinton won it by 7 points in 2016.\n\nKnight has signaled he's not interested in a rematch, but Hill has several GOP challengers. The best funded contender is Mike Garcia, a former Naval fighter pilot who now works as an executive at Raytheon. Hill will likely have a massive cash advantage over any opponent. She had $1.5 million in the bank at the end of September. Garcia had less than $350,000.\n\nAlly Mutnick contributed reporting to this report.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5c/c7/8ff961ca44f7bb058e851044673f/191022-katie-hill-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
