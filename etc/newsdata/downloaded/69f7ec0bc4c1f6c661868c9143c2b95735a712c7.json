The brand, known for its iconic outerwear, took the idea of recycled fabric, made it into something warm and durable, and added it to one of its best-selling collections. Thermoball Eco is a new take on the popular Thermoball line of jackets and it\u2019s all made from recycled polyester, inside and out.\n\nThe Thermoball Eco line has both men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles and encompasses any kind of outerwear preference, from vests to parkas. There\u2019s even a Thermoball Eco hat with quilted insulation, as well. Each style gives you the freedom to layer under or over depending on the weather. The quilted design gives the poly-fill room to expand, covering you in a blanket of insulation. It's all packable and portable and everything in the new line is under $350, so if you were in the market for a new layer but also want to give back to the planet, now\u2019s your chance. | Shop at The North Face >\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
