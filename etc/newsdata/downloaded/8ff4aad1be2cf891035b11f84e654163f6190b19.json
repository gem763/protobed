We killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi,' the president announced to great applause at International Association of Chiefs of Police Annual Conference.\n\nTrump bragged he was able to kill the terrorist leader when his predecessor, Barack Obama, didn't.\n\n'They've been looking for him for a long time. They've been looking for him for many years. He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's dead. He's dead. He's dead as a doornail and he didn't die bravely. He should have been killed years ago. Another president should have gotten him. But to me it was a very important,' he noted.\n\n'I'd say ... I want al-Baghdadi. Get him. And they got him,' he added.\n\nDonald Trump bragged about the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a speech to police chiefs\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, being interviewed by his group's Al-Furqan media outlet in April\n\nAl-Baghdadi was the Iraqi-born leader of ISIS before he was killed by U.S. special forces in Syria's northwestern Idlib Province.\n\nHe was directly involved in atrocities and human rights violations, including the genocide of Yazidis in Iraq, sex slavery, organized rape, and systematic executions.\n\nThe State Department had offered a $25 million award for information or intelligence on his whereabouts.\n\nTrump said it was a 'big-time' kill for the United States in its war on terror.\n\n'He was big-time. He built the ISIS caliphate. You hear about ISIS. That was him. It was once the physical size of the state of Ohio, and had 7 million people, and it was growing big, big, big. And they had a problem. It started about two and a half years ago,' he said, referring to the date he became president as the audience laughed.\n\n'And during my administration I, we, all together destroyed the caliphate 100 per cent,' he added.\n\nTrump said earlier Monday he may release the footage of the raid that killed al-Baghdadi amid questions about his description of it.\n\n'We're thinking about it. We may. The question was, am I considering releasing video footage of the raid. And we may take certain parts of it and release it, yes,' the president told reporters at Joint Base Andrews as he prepared to leave for Chicago.\n\nPresident Trump watched the special forces operation to kill al-Baghdadi via drone footage, instead of a body-worn camera, so he did not see the moment the ISIS leader died, according to military and intelligence officials.\n\nBut the president used colorful, description language when he announced al-Baghdadi's death, saying the ISIS leader died 'whimpering and crying and screaming', and 'like a dog and a coward'.\n\nTrump described the video footage he watched as 'something really amazing to see' and that it was 'as though you were watching a movie'.\n\nThe site where a U.S. military strike reportedly killed so-called Islamic State leader al-Baghdadi\n\nPresident Donald Trump watching in the Situation Room as U.S. Special Operations forces close in on ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\n\nIn the weekend raid, helicopters carried U.S. special forces to the compound of al-Baghdadi where he was hiding near Idlib in northwestern Syria.\n\nHalf way around the world, Trump watched the raid in real-time via a video link as troops blasted into the hideout and sent the most-wanted militant running the last steps of his life before al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide belt.\n\nSurveillance footage on several video screens showing various angles of the overhead maneuvers were relayed via drone to multiple screens in the Situation Room at the White House.\n\nHowever, military sources said the president would not have been able to see what was happening inside the compound or the moment al-Baghdadi fled to a dead-end tunnel with three of his children, according to the New York Times.\n\nTrump said on Sunday: 'I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi's fighters and companions were killed with him.\n\n'He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.'\n\nTrump added that Baghdadi drugged three of his children with him: 'They were led to certain death.'\n\nHe the added: 'He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children.\n\nHis body was mutilated by the blast. the tunnel had caved in on it, in addition. But test results gave certain, immediate and totally positive identification.\n\nIt was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him.'\n\nA satellite view of the reported residence of ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, prior to the airstrikes.

The president probably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground,' Esper said on Sunday.\n\nThe commandos were wearing body cameras, but these did not broadcast in real time due to the nature of the operation.\n\nThis footage can be downloaded and reviewed after the operation finished, according to Pentagon officials.\n\nA Defense Department source told the New York Times it was possible Trump spoke to either the Delta Force operators involved in the raid or their superiors.", "description": "Donald Trump stomped on the grave of\u00a0ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a speech to police chiefs in Chicago on Monday.\u00a0 'He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's dead,' he said.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S Political Reporter", "David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20286590-0-image-a-36_1572278787162.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
