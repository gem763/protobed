So, she started a Google doc with the names of therapists who specialize in the unique needs of Black women.\n\n\u201cI spend a lot of time online and I catch these conversations over and over again about Black women looking for Black women therapists and I thought there must be some way where we can organize this,\u201d Bradford, a clinical psychologist and podcast host, told HuffPost. \u201cSo I made a Google doc and put out a call on Twitter and Facebook saying, \u2018Hey, if you\u2019ve had a good experience with a therapist and you\u2019re a Black woman, give me their name and I\u2019ll compile it into a list where other people can find them as well.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom that Google doc, Therapy for Black Girls was born. Today, Therapy for Black Girls has grown into a podcast, a blog, an expansive directory for therapists and psychologists and an online hub for all things melanated mental health. It\u2019s one of the go-to places on the internet where Black women (and men) can openly discuss the benefits of therapy and mental health care without shame, stigma or code-switching.\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of Black people, therapy is still such a foreign concept,\u201d Bradford said. \u201cA lot of us have been raised to feel like whatever goes on in this house stays in this house, and the idea of talking to a stranger feels very weird and like something you wouldn\u2019t do. There\u2019s comfort in feeling like if I\u2019m going to take this step, I want it to be with someone who is going to get me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not easy for people of color to find medical professionals who understand their cultural nuances, their unique life experiences or even their language. There are substantially fewer therapists of color than there are white practitioners, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And even if people of color do manage to find a therapist who\u2019s a good match, many barriers to treatment may still stand in their way.\n\n\u201cPeople of color have a really hard time finding a therapist,\u201d explained Bradford. \u201cTherapy can be very expensive even with insurance so when people are looking at their finances sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like that is going to be a priority. Some people live in very rural areas so the number of therapists, let alone therapists of color, may be very limited.\u201d\n\nOf course, social media and websites like Bradford\u2019s provide a way for people of color to seek the help they may need, find a community to share their journeys with and lift the stigma around mental health care that still plagues many communities of color. HuffPost rounded up nine online resources to help people of color learn about and talk about therapy, wellness, trauma and personal growth.\n\nThese resources are NOT a replacement for professional mental health care or medical care. But they can be a place to go to give yourself the motivation and information you may need to begin your mental health journey and learn that there is a therapy style (and a therapist) for everyone.\n\nJoy Harden Bradford\u2019s brainchild has grown into a podcast, blog, booming social media network and one-stop shop for Black people of any gender to find a therapist that is right for them.\n\nSimilar to Therapy for Black Girls, Therapy for Black Men is a directory and social network dedicated to helping men and boys of color find mental health guidance or professional support. On the website, founder Vladimire Calixte shares that she founded the forum to break the stigma of Black men seeking mental health care: \u201cIn the Black community, Black men are told to be strong, walk it off, don\u2019t cry, and to man-up. With TherapyForBlackMen.org, you do not have to go on this journey alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Friend Zone\u201d is a weekly podcast about all things mental health, mental wellness and mental hygiene (\u2019cause who in the hell wants a musty brain?). Every Wednesday, hosts and real-life friends Fran, Dustin and Assant\u00e9 share often-hilarious stories about their personal growth and lessons learned along the way on subjects like conflict resolution, parenting their inner child, discovering their love languages and much more.\n\n\u201cThe Read\u201d is a popular podcast (and soon-to-be television show) about analyzing (and often dragging) celebrity and entertainment culture. But in a newer segment titled Crissle\u2019s Couch, co-host Crissle West shares lessons she\u2019s actively learning in therapy while answering listeners\u2019 letters and offering her own advice for growing through a setback, trauma or misunderstood mental health issues (and sometimes Kid Fury will chime in with his own advice).\n\nBrown Girl Therapy is a social media platform founded by HuffPost editor Sahaj Kohli that provides a wellness community for South Asian and first-generation women. This pro-therapy page provides advice, affirmations and a safe space to share the unique experiences of being a first-generation American.\n\nTherapy for Latinx provides resources for the Latinx community to \u201cheal, thrive, and become advocates for their own mental health,\u201d according to its website. Founded by Brandie Carlos, the site provides a directory of Latinx therapists from all over the country to help with the healing process. The Instagram page offers reminders and affirmations to encourage the Latinx community to stay on the therapy journey.\n\nLatinx Therapy is another directory and social media platform dedicated to destigmatizing mental health care in the Latinx community. Founded by Adriana Alejandre, the platform offers a bilingual podcast and extensive therapist directory for those seeking help or reassurance as they explore their mental health.\n\nThe National Queer and Trans Therapists of Color Network (NQTTCN) is a healing justice organization that works to transform mental health for queer and trans people of color. Since May 2016, NQTTCN has been building a network of mental health practitioners as well as a Mental Health Fund for those in need of financial assistance. They share resources for organizations seeking to uplift the community of trans people of color through healing justice initiatives.\n\nMannMukti, which is Hindu for \u201cmental liberation,\u201d is a place for South Asians to speak up and normalize mental health care in their communities. A self-described storytelling platform, MannMukti seeks to \u201cencourage healthy, open dialogue of mental health issues in an effort to remove stigma, improve awareness and promote self-care.\u201d Interested parties can join the community forum to get started sharing their own mental health journeys.", "description": "Looking for a safe space?
