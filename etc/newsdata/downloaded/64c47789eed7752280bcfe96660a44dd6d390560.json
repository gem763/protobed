The incident violates the principle that U.S. officials should never allow or encourage foreign governments to interfere in U.S. elections.\n\nTrump advisers and senior administration aides pivoted any discussion of the president\u2019s call and ensuing whistleblower complaint to focus on the Bidens \u2014 in an effort to turn the attention to a rival much the way the Trump campaign undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy in 2016 by constantly bringing the discussion back to her campaign\u2019s stolen emails.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s strategy on these matters has always been pretty clear: Never back up and go forward. He learned that from Page Six,\u201d said Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump who served as House speaker during Republicans\u2019 impeachment inquiry of President Bill Clinton. \u201cFor the average American, this won\u2019t move anything. It just further pins the Democrats into a negative anti-Trump position.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that, in the long run, the White House and campaign think the media eventually and reluctantly will have to take a serious look at Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings both in China and the Ukraine, and it will be devastating,\u201d Gingrich added.\n\nThe White House is betting Trump can ride out this \u201coutrage du jour,\u201d as one senior administration official called it, and move on just as he has skated through the release of the Mueller report; concerns of late about a possible recession; the Charlottesville, Va., uproar; Stormy Daniels; the explosive \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201c tape; and dozens of other threats to his presidency.\n\n\u201cEverything is presented as Armageddon. The absolutely worst thing he has ever done! You can excuse the public for believing nothing is that way,\u201d the official added.\n\nWhite House and Department of Justice lawyers are tuning out the media coverage and focusing on the legal nuances of the whistleblower statute, while the president is leading the ensuing political battle.\n\nLike any public relations guru, he has sought to get out ahead of the Ukraine story, set the boundaries of the narrative so that Biden is in the bull's-eye, and overwhelm Americans with new and often conflicting information so the details change by the hour \u2014 and always at his bidding.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s doing the best it\u2019s ever done. They\u2019re going to lose the election,\u201d Trump told reporters before a bilateral meeting with the Iraqi president at the United Nations.\n\n\u201cThey say it\u2019s a positive for me,\u201d he added about the impeachment proceedings.\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, Trump announced on Twitter that he intended to release on Wednesday a transcript of his call with the Ukrainian president. And a senior administration official said the White House also plans to release to Congress by the end of this week the whistleblower complaint and inspector general documents at the center of the fight.\n\nBoth moves suggest the White House is confident it can withstand any fallout from the Ukraine call.\n\nBut current and former administration aides believe Trump will view the latest impeachment inquiry as a major blow to his ego \u2014 and the proceedings will likely distract him, cloud all his meetings and halt any agenda for this fall, including the passage of a major trade bill heading into an election year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Trump survived the explosive \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201c tape, the Charlottesville uproar, Stormy Daniels, the Mueller report and dozens of other threats to his presidency.
