Here\u2019s how to make a change so you\u2019re not just killing time on Facebook waiting for the clock to strike five.\n\nDear LH, Here\u2019s a question, one that has bugged me throughout my professional life. How can I keep myself from going crazy, knowing I am basically pissing my life away twiddling my thumbs? I\u2019ve heard that the average desk worker\u2014which I am\u2014spends about 45% of their workday doing actual work. The rest of the time is spent doing other things, like browsing the internet, texting, just generally goofing off. That definitely describes my work day. If it were up to me, I would do my work, and be in and out of the office in just a few hours. But because I\u2019m bound by rather nebulously defined \u201coffice hours,\u201d I\u2019m stuck here from morning to evening. So I spread work out, and fiddle away the hours in between, painfully aware I could be doing other, more enjoyable, productive and interesting things elsewhere. What can be done?! Thanks, Bored At Work\n\nDear BAW,\n\nI\u2019m not sure about that statistic, but the general point is probably true: A lot of us fritter away a lot of the \u201cwork\u201d day. I suppose one solution would be a shorter workweek, an idea that has merit, but also requires a society-wide reconfiguration of labour norms. You might not want to wait on that.\n\nAnd for what it\u2019s worth, time-fritterers even include people\u2014like me\u2014who are self-employed and work at home. I don\u2019t have to \u201clook busy\u201d for anybody, and yet it took me 15 minutes to write this paragraph because I stopped in the middle to Google some supposedly relevant fact and somehow ended up watching a Taylor Swift video.\n\nSo the key question to ask yourself is what you\u2019d rather be doing with your goof-off minutes and hours. And the most important bit of that advice is ask yourself. That\u2019s because nobody else is ever going to materialise into your work life and say: \u201cPlease tell me what would make your days truly fulfilling, and I will arrange a fresh set of responsibilities and opportunities and a schedule that makes it all possible!\u201d So here are some possibilities.\n\nGet ambitious\n\nLet\u2019s say your answer is that all you really want is more stimulation during your work day. There\u2019s a decent chance you can make that happen. Consider what existing projects or initiatives at your company that you can get involved in. Consider what projects or initiatives you can start.\n\nTalk to your manager about areas where help is needed and your skills could be useful. Think about skills you\u2019d like to acquire and what you could do to put you on that path. Maybe this involves working toward a professional goal, or maybe it\u2019s about the acquisition of skill for its own sake.\n\nHelp out your peers. Take on new responsibility. If what will satisfy you is a more challenging work day, challenge yourself.\n\nChange your situation\n\nBut let\u2019s say all of that sounds horrible to you, because you don\u2019t really like or care about your company or the work you\u2019re paid to do. Fair enough! Consider finding a work situation that\u2019s actually engaging.\n\nIn addition to just, you know, seeking a better job, which by itself can be a productive project, consider working for yourself. Maybe you can figure out a way to consult, or work on contracts that give you more control over your schedule. (To have more free time might entail making less money, but perhaps that will suit you just fine?) Or start something new that tracks closer to your real interests. (You may end up working longer hours, but perhaps you\u2019ll enjoy it?)\n\nYou may well, like me, still end up wasting chunks of the work day. But at least you won\u2019t be doing it to in acquiescence to someone else\u2019s demands.\n\nJust declare victory\n\nFinally, consider the possibility that your boring, unchallenging, time-wasting job could be an opportunity. Recognising this might require a bit of a mental reset, and for that I consulted my friend (and frequent collaborator) Joshua Glenn, who among other things is the author of The Idler\u2019s Glossary, an excellent book about not working that I suggest you surreptitiously read while on the clock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in that situation,\u201d Josh said when I described your plight, working for a big company that \u201cdidn\u2019t have enough for me to do every day. Or maybe I was just way more efficient at doing my job than they\u2019d expected?\u201d For a while, he killed time shopping on eBay or playing games.\n\nThink of your employer as a Medici-like patron of the arts\n\n\u201cBut then I came to think of my employer as a Medici-like patron of the arts: a source of air conditioning, office supplies, Internet access, and\u2014over the course of each day\u2014several hours of free time,\u201d he said. He plotted his first books and networked with people whose work he admired. And, he adds: \u201cI regularly walked around the whole building, poking my nose into places I didn\u2019t belong and asking everyone about their own work.\u201d\n\nEventually he quit, co-founding business and producing a series of entertaining side projects. But the point isn\u2019t that you need to become an entrepreneur or write books, per se. It\u2019s that you should think about your free time as a gift of sorts, one that you can exploit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a particular plan or end goal in mind,\u201d Josh concluded. \u201cBut it was important to me to use that time creatively\u2014which is not the same thing as productively.\u201d\n\nThat last point is important. It may take some thought and experimentation. But if you want to make the most of your free time, it\u2019s worth putting in a little extra work\u2014for a change.", "description": "You\u2019re wasting half your work day goofing off because there just isn\u2019t enough to do \u2014  and it\u2019s driving you crazy.
