Anyone else who did this would face federal criminal prosecution,\" Nadler said in a statement Monday. \"He has dangled pardons, been involved in campaign finance violations and stonewalled Congress across the board, noting that he will defy all subpoenas. No one is above the law.\"\n\nHorowitz's report, meanwhile, cast a harsh light on Comey's actions, stating he violated bureau policies by drafting, disseminating and retaining memos documenting discussions he had with the president. It also said that he leaked sensitive information on an ongoing investigation, by leaking a memo on a discussion about the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nApart from the Comey probe, Horowitz has another pending report that is eagerly anticipated by Republicans. That one deals with the FBI's use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to obtain a warrant for monitoring former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Republicans claim the FBI misrepresented information to get the warrant during the early stages of the Russia investigation.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has predicted that Horowitz's FISA report will be \"ugly and damning\" for the Justice Department.\n\nTuesday\u2019s criticism comes after another Republican, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, blasted Democrats for not yet calling Horowitz in for a hearing.\n\nREP. JIM JORDAN: DEMOCRATS PUSHING 'RIDICULOUS' IMPEACHMENT PROBE AT COST OF AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n\u201cHe just issued a scathing report about Jim Comey, the former FBI director, and nothing has been scheduled to bring in Mr. Horowitz to answer our questions,\u201d Jordan said Monday on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re solely focused on going after the president, you can\u2019t do what\u2019s best for the country, and that\u2019s been the problem with the Democrats,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcCarthy had a similar message Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the Democrats to stop focusing on trying to tear the president down but actually build America up,\u201d he said.", "description": "Republican congressional leaders chastised House Judiciary Committee Democrats on Tuesday for allegedly refusing to call Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to testify, after he released a bombshell\u00a0report describing how former FBI Director James Comey violated agency rules with his handling of sensitive information.", "authors": ["Ronn Blitzer"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/AP19045039588224-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
