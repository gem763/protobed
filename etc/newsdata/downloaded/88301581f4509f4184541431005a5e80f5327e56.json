Pence said on Monday that Trump spoke directly to Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised not to attack the border town of Kobani, which in 2015 witnessed the Islamic State group\u2019s first defeat in a battle by U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump communicated to him very clearly that the United States of America wants Turkey to stop the invasion, implement an immediate cease-fire and to begin to negotiate with Kurdish forces in Syria to bring an end to the violence,\u201d Pence said.\n\nThe Americans were scrambling for Syria\u2019s exits, a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the Islamic State group, whose violent takeover of Syrian and Iraqi lands five years ago was the reason American forces went in the first place.\n\nTrump said the approximately 1,000 U.S. troops who had been partnering with local Kurdish fighters to battle the Islamic State in northern Syria are leaving the country. They will remain in the Middle East, he said, to \u201cmonitor the situation\u201d and to prevent a revival of IS \u2014 a goal that even Trump\u2019s allies say has become much more difficult as a result of the U.S. pullout.\n\nThe U.S. troops being withdrawn from northern Syria will reposition in Iraq, Kuwait and possibly Jordan, according to the U.S. official, who spoke to The Associated Press on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive planning for the U.S. pullout.\n\nThe official said the American troops have pulled out of the Manbij area, where U.S. outposts were set up in 2017. Troops are consolidating their positions to prepare to fly out of the country soon.\n\nThe official said the U.S. troops in Iraq could perform operations against the IS militants in Syria as they did before creating the now-abandoned partnership with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nThe Turks began attacks in Syria last week against the Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the Turks see as terrorists. On Monday, Syrian government troops moved north toward the border region, setting up a potential clash with Turkish-led forces.\n\nTrump said Turkey\u2019s invasion is \u201cprecipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes,\u201d a reference to reports of Turkish-backed fighters executing Kurdish fighters on the battlefield.\n\nThe Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said they had reached a deal with President Bashar Assad\u2019s government to help them fend off Turkey\u2019s invasion, a move that brings Russian forces deeper into the conflict.\n\nIn his sanctions announcement, Trump said he was halting negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey and raising steel tariffs back up to 50%. Trump also imposed sanctions on three senior Turkish officials and Turkey\u2019s defense and energy ministries.\n\n\u201cI am fully prepared to swiftly destroy Turkey\u2019s economy if Turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will hurt an already weak Turkish economy. Pence said the U.S. will continue to ramp up the sanctions \u201cunless Turkey is willing to embrace a cease-fire, come to the negotiating table and end the violence.\u201d\n\nAmerican troops consolidated their positions in northern Syria on Monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal, a U.S. defense official said.\n\nThe official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name, said U.S. officials were weighing options for a potential future counter-IS campaign, including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside Syria, perhaps in Iraq.\n\nThe hurried preparations for a U.S. exit were triggered by Trump\u2019s decision Saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday he would travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to urge European allies to impose \u201cdiplomatic and economic measures\u201d against Turkey, a fellow NATO ally, for what Esper called Ankara\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d actions.\n\nEsper said Turkey\u2019s incursion had created unacceptable risk to U.S. forces in northern Syria and \u201cwe also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict.\u201d\n\nThe only exception to the U.S. withdrawal from Syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called Tanf in southern Syria near the Jordanian border along the strategically important Baghdad-to-Damascus highway. Those troops work with Syrian opposition forces unrelated to the Kurdish-led fighters in northern Syria.\n\nEsper said the U.S. withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure no U.S. equipment was left behind. He declined to say how long that might take.\n\nIn a series of tweets Monday, Trump defended his gamble that pulling U.S. forces out of Syria would not weaken U.S. security and credibility. He took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his Syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the Kurds and plays into the hands of Russia.\n\n\u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d\n\nTrump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops, believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election, White House officials say.\n\nThis has effectively ended a five-year effort to partner with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group. Hundreds of IS supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading Turkish-led forces and Kurdish fighters, and analysts said an IS resurgence seemed more likely, just months after Trump declared the extremists defeated.\n\nTrump spoke about the IS detainees in a phone call Monday with Kurdish General Mazloum Kobani. Pence said Mazloum assured the Republican president that Kurdish forces would continue to support the prisons holding IS fighters.\n\nRepublican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, normally a staunch Trump supporter, said he was \u201cgravely concerned\u201d by events in Syria and Trump\u2019s response.\n\nWithdrawing U.S. forces from Syria \u201cwould re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Trump is weakening America.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this administration\u2019s chaotic and haphazard approach to policy by tweet is endangering the lives of U.S. troops and civilians,\u201d Menendez said in a statement.\n\nThe Kurds have turned to the Syrian government and Russia for military assistance. The prospect of enhancing the Syrian government\u2019s position on the battlefield and inviting Russia to get more directly involved is seen by Trump\u2019s critics as a major mistake.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Lemire contributed to this report.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Targeting Turkey's economy, President Donald Trump announced sanctions aimed at restraining the Turks' assault against Kurdish fighters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/15/59c919_syria-turkey-syrian-army-58755-friday-oct-11-2019-file-photo-turkish-backed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
