(TSX: MDI) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Norex Drilling Limited (\u201cNorex\u201d), a family-owned drilling company and a leading exploration drilling contractor based in Timmins, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe purchase price for the acquisition is valued at an amount up to $19.7 million, which will consist of the following: (i) a cash payment of $15.2 million payable on closing of the transaction, subject to working capital adjustments; (ii) $2.0 million paid by the issuance of common shares of Major Drilling, valued on the closing of the transaction (subject to TSX approval); and (iii) an earn out of $2.5 million payable in cash following the third anniversary of closing. The cash portion of the purchase price is expected to be funded from Major Drilling\u2019s current cash balance.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to welcome Norex and its 120 employees into the Major Drilling group. Norex has been operating successfully in the Ontario marketplace for some 40 years, and has a solid reputation with its clients. The acquisition of Norex is a unique opportunity for Major Drilling to gain a strong position to service our customers in both surface and underground exploration drilling services in the prolific Northeastern Ontario region. The culture and operational values of both companies are very similar in terms of personnel and strategies, and this will allow us to provide our customers with expanded drilling services,\u201d said Denis Larocque, President & CEO of Major Drilling.\n\nMajor Drilling is retaining the management team, is gaining access to skilled and experienced drillers and personnel, and is taking over existing contracts. Through this purchase, Major Drilling will also acquire an additional 22 drill rigs, including 17 compatible specialized surface drill rigs and 5 underground drills, together with related support equipment and inventory.\n\nFor the last two years, Norex had average yearly revenue of approximately $21 million and EBITDA of approximately $5 million. While Norex\u2019s historical performance should not be viewed as guidance for future performance, we are optimistic about the continuing growth potential in this region considering Norex\u2019s customers\u2019 stated plans and the current market condition in the mining industry.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to close on or about November 1, 2019, and is subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nNon-IFRS Measures\n\nMajor Drilling uses the non-IFRS financial measure, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Major Drilling believes this non-IFRS financial measure is key, for both management and investors, in evaluating performance at a consolidated level. EBITDA is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company\u2019s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. This measure does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies. This measure should not be construed as a substitute or an alternative to other financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nSome of the statements contained in this news release may be forward-looking statements, such as, but not limited to, those relating to: the level of activity in the mining industry and the demand for Major Drilling\u2019s and Norex\u2019s services; the Canadian and international economic environments and conditions; the post-acquisition accretion to Major Drilling\u2019s financial results; organic growth opportunities; the impact of operational changes; and the expected closing date of the proposed acquisition.
