Then in August, FedEx officially divorced from Amazon by halting its ground shipping services. The divorce between FedEx and Amazon was seen as a big blow to FedEx, which has been severely underperforming as of late, as rivals such as UPS (UPS) have been thriving. Shares of FedEx have tumbled 30% over the past year, while UPS rose 5%. UPS still maintains its partnership with Amazon.\n\nWhile the Amazon-FedEx divorce has been perceived as a big loss for the shipping giant, the Amazon partnership wasn\u2019t actually a large chunk of business for FedEx. Amazon only represented a little over one percent of FedEx\u2019s total revenue last year.\n\nManagement\u2019s commentary surrounding China will also be in focus. FedEx had several instances in which operational errors prevented Huawei packages from being delivered to the U.S. China represents a mid to high single digit portion of FedEx\u2019s overall revenue.\n\nAnalysts expect FedEx to report first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.16 per share on $17.06 billion in revenue. The options market is implying a 4% move in either direction following its report, which is in line with the average post-earnings move over the past four quarters.\n\nMeanwhile, recent IPO Chewy will also deliver second-quarter financial results after the closing bell. Tuesday\u2019s report is Chewy\u2019s second earnings announcement since its IPO in June. The online pet products retailer is expected to report an adjusted earnings loss of 11 cents per share on $1.13 billion in revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nConsensus anticipates that Chewy\u2019s second quarter revenue will have grown at a healthy 30%. Margins are also expected to have improved during the quarter. Nevertheless, much like its recent IPO peers, Chewy is a high-growth story, but the company has yet to turn a profit.\n\nChewy debuted on the public market June 14 after pricing shares at $22. The stock soared 34% since its IPO and has outperformed the broader market which is up 4.5% in the same time period.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
