It is old, and has served successive generations of my family relatively well, despite showing its age, with one leg just a little shorter than the other three.\n\nA little while back, a young man came to visit who said he was a brilliant carpenter, and promised to make my table more stable than it had ever been. He insisted that I did not need some expert who would overcharge for poor results. He had all the right tools and skills, and it would be the easiest job to do.\n\nFoolishly, I accepted his assurances, and he got to work. Out came his tape measure, which looked like it had an even longer life than my table, with some of the markings smudged, and the tape fraying at the edges. Apparently, this was some kind of a magic tape measure \u2013 we both just needed to believe that the measurement was right, and it would be.\n\nIn no time at all, he pronounced he would have to cut one leg down by half an inch. Obviously, on hearing this, I questioned his competence, and asked him to follow the well-known carpenters\u2019 rule of \u201cmeasure twice and cut once\u201d, and take a second measurement. He flatly refused to do so, since, as he said, \u201cyou have had your measurement, it would call into question my right and competence to ply my trade if I let you have a second measurement\u201d. Furthermore, he said, if it all went wrong It would be my own fault for not having sufficient faith in him and his magic tape measure.\n\nQuite unsurprisingly, my table is now ruined, all because I believed an absolute charlatan who had no intention of listening to reason, or believed he could ever do wrong.\n\nHe is now off spending his ill-gotten gains down at Conservative club bar, where no doubt, he is telling everyone stupid enough to listen to him, what a clever chap he really is, and how it was all my fault, because I did not have enough faith in him and his magic tape measure.\n\nIf you support the governments\u2019 position that it would be unconstitutional to have a second referendum (actually the first based on the actual provable facts), then just think of my kitchen table, and who knows, you might just think again.\n\nDavid Curran\n\nFeltham\n\nThe battle of Brexit\n\nAm I alone in noticing that the suggested date for an election, 14 October, is the anniversary of the Battle of Hastings. Is this coincidence or is Boris going to hijack English history by recasting the battle as England versus Europe.\n\nFrancis Beswick\n\nStretford\n\nUnelected bureaucrats\n\nYour newspaper is full of the chaos that is current politics and you give much of the credit for it to Dominic Cummings, the eminence grise in Downing Street. It is therefore an unelected bureaucrat who seems to be dictating what should happen next in the Brexit process. Reminds me of one of the key reasons put forward to leave the EU. Unelected bureaucrats?\n\nOh! The irony.\n\nChristopher Bratt\n\nArnside\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit bluff\n\nBoris Johnson tells us he wants a deal with the EU. I believe he is lying, that he wants a hard Brexit and knows it will be catastrophic in the medium term, but he wants to shift the blame for this onto \u201ctraitors within\u201d and Remainers, who are \u201cundermining\u201d his negotiating position, and, of course, onto the intransigence of the EU. My reasons for thinking this? The ministers and advisers he has appointed, his slow start in contacting either Ireland or the EU, in contrast to his early contact with Donald Trump, his insistence that the backstop must go, which he knows the EU cannot accept, and his failure to come up with any new ideas for a compromise on this, along, of course, with his excellent track record when it comes to deceit and untruths. We must not fall for this.\n\nAdrian Cosker\n\nHitchin\n\nFood shortages\n\nTom Peck (\u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u2019! It starts with the suspension of the rule of law and the expulsion of the sane\u201d Tuesday 2 September) reminds us that Michael Gove said \u201ceveryone will get the food they need\u201d after a no-deal Brexit. Notice it is not the food they want. So he is saying we will have enough food to stay alive but no more. Bread and scrape it is then.\n\nAlan Pack\n\nCanterbury\n\nEyes Wide Shut 20 years on\n\nStanley Kubrick\u2019s Eyes Wide Shut did a great job of deromanticising the boring and extravagant lives of the uber-rich. Nothing about it made me envy any of the characters, which was my takeaway of its central theme, as well as its importance. (Wasn\u2019t there a subplot of a man goading his daughter into sex work? Something which many stage moms subject their hopeful progeny to by proxy?)\n\nKenney C Kennedy\n\nShreveport (USA)", "description": "The deployment of auxiliary ship RFA Mounts Bay to the Bahamas to assist in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, will be welcome, but is it enough?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/11/Hurricane-Dorian-4.jpg"}
