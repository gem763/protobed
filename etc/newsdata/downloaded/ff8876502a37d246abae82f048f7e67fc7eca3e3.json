It doesn\u2019t hurt that a pro-gun group just scored a really big win on that case, either.\n\nIn a new ruling, the court found that a gun owners\u2019 group and several individual members that are fighting the city regulations do have standing to challenge most of the ordinances. That is a reversal of a 2018 decision by Dauphin County Judge Andrew Dowling. The court\u2019s 7-0 ruling also reverses its own past decisions that have shielded some local gun ordinances from similar lawsuits under the argument that plaintiffs had not been prosecuted under their terms and therefore could show no harm. Writing for the majority, Judge Kevin Brobson noted that the appellants here \u201chave no real alternative to address their grievance. They can curb their conduct to conform to the ordinances\u2019 mandates or they can willfully violate the law and face criminal prosecution\u2026 \u201cIt makes little sense to wait for appellants to break the law, which we presume they do not want to do, before they can challenge it,\u201d Brobson concluded. The new ruling permits the Harrisburg lawsuit to proceed on ordinances that: Bar anyone under the age of 18 from carrying a gun in public unless they are accompanied by an adult.\n\nProhibiting the shooting of any guns by the public within the city limits for any purpose other than self-defense.\n\nRequire gun owners to report to police any loss or theft of a gun within 48 hours of discovery.\n\nBar the possession or firing of guns in city parks.\n\nThe ordinances all date from 2009, but like many other local gun laws in the state, haven\u2019t been enforced. That\u2019s fine because an unenforced law is a non-existent law for all practical purposes.\n\nHowever, Harrisburg Mayor Eric Papenfuse has ordered the police department to begin enforcement of the measures, which means it\u2019s time to do something about them.\n\nWhile some of these measures may seem to be no big deal\u2013laws against discharging a firearm except in self-defense are hardly unusual, for example\u2013the fact of the matter is that these still violate the state\u2019s preemption laws. They need to be heard in court and allow the judicial branch of the state\u2019s government to act.\n\nFurther, this also makes it clear that pro-gun groups who seek to take on Pittsburgh\u2019s new \u201cassault weapon\u201d ban will also have standing in their lawsuit. This is key as this destroys one of the city\u2019s most likely avenues of attack in the proceedings. Now they\u2019ll have to win on the merits of their case, which means they have to convince the courts that preemption is somehow illegal and shouldn\u2019t stand.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that the lawsuit against Harrisburg will already settle that question just fine as well.\n\nThis is a big win up in Pennsylvania, and I hope it\u2019s just the most recent of many, many more.", "description": "While the lawsuit against Harrisburg, PA is probably easy for some to dismiss, the truth is that it opens the door for a big win against Pittsburgh.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
