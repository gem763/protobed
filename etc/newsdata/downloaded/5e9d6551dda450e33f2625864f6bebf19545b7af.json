Many of these memoirs crystallize around the killings of black men and women, of Renisha McBride, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner. \u201cI write you in your 15th year,\u201d Coates addresses his son at the beginning of \u201cBetween the World and Me.\u201d \u201cThis was the week you learned that the killers of Michael Brown would go free.\u201d In the opening scenes of \u201cBreathe,\u201d we find Perry and her son sitting on the sofa, listening to the news of Troy Davis\u2019s execution. These memoirs are full of the love and frantic fear black parents feel for their children, and the fugitive hope that education or class might offer some measure of protection. But they are also rich evocations of abundance: \u201cI cannot clip your wings,\u201d Perry writes to her sons. She will not permit them lives of narrow circumspection: \u201cI want your wingspan wide.\u201d Several accounts vibrate with the exhilaration and anxiety of rupturing ancient silences. \u201cI was the third generation of things we didn\u2019t talk about,\u201d Terese Marie Mailhot writes in \u201cHeart Berries,\u201d a series of letters to her lover, in which she delves into her childhood on the Seabird Indian Reservation in the Pacific Northwest, and familial legacies of abuse and addiction. In \u201cHeavy,\u201d an exorcism of his childhood in Mississippi, Kiese Laymon addresses his beloved mother: \u201cNeither of us would ever, under any circumstance, be honest about yesterday. This is how we are taught to love in America,\u201d he writes, remembering the brutal beatings she administered in an effort to make him so perfect, so unimpeachable, that he might survive America.\n\nIt\u2019s a recurring note in several books \u2014 a parent\u2019s cruel and desperate attempts to toughen up a child for the world. \u201cI grew up in a house drawn between love and fear,\u201d Coates writes. \u201cI would hear it in Dad\u2019s voice \u2014 \u2018Either I can beat him, or the police.\u2019 Maybe that saved me. Maybe it didn\u2019t.\u201d In Ocean Vuong\u2019s essays and autofiction written as letters to his mother (a Vietnamese immigrant), he imagines something similar: \u201cPerhaps to lay hands on your child is to prepare him for war, to say that to possess a heartbeat is not as simple as the heart\u2019s task of saying yes yes yes to the body. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThose notes of uncertainty interest me \u2014 \u201cMaybe that saved me. Maybe it didn\u2019t\u201d; \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d \u2014 given the form\u2019s history. Traditionally, the memoir addressed to one\u2019s descendants enshrined an official family story. \u201cDear Son: I have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes of my ancestors,\u201d Ben Franklin begins his \u201cAutobiography.\u201d \u201cImagining it may be equally agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a week\u2019s uninterrupted leisure in my present country retirement, I sit down to write them for you.\u201d The memoir continues in this vein of purring complacency, the sweetness of a life tasted twice, first in the living, then in the telling.", "description": "From Ta-Nehisi Coates to Terese Marie Mailhot to Imani Perry, writers are letting their audiences eavesdrop on private conversations.
