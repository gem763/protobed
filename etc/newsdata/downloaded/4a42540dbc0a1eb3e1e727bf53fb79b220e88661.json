Young Boosts Profile as Contrarian Foreign-Policy Voice Among GOP", "url": "https://wsj.com/articles/sen-young-boosts-profile-as-contrarian-foreign-policy-voice-among-gop-11567252800?mod=rsswn", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-08-31", "downloaded_at": "2019-09-02 07:02:50.893114+00:00", "text": "WASHINGTON\u2014Sen. Todd Young was hoping to get the White House\u2019s attention when he temporarily blocked a State Department nominee in December 2017, escalating his campaign to end a Saudi blockade of humanitarian aid into Yemen. What the GOP freshman from Indiana hadn\u2019t sought was a call from President Trump asking Mr. Young if he knew the president\u2019s margin of victory in the state and warning to drop his hold.\n\nIn a party where regularly opposing the president often results in a primary challenge or early retirement, Mr. Young has made the risky decision to become a high-profile skeptic of one of the administration\u2019s key foreign allies. After advancing to become the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2014long a launching point for a career in Senate leadership\u2014Mr. Young has continued to challenge Saudi Arabia\u2019s activity in Yemen and, by extension, the Trump administration\u2019s support for the Persian Gulf ally.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Sen. Young\u2019s disagreements with President Trump on foreign policy will hurt his ability to keep rising in Republican leadership? Join the conversation below.\n\nWith his work, Mr. Young is raising his profile as a contrarian Republican voice on foreign policy, as he hopes to change how members of his party think about confronting Iran. Unlike some Republicans critical of the administration who want to reduce U.S. military commitments abroad, Mr. Young is an internationalist, seeking to make humanitarian aid to Yemen a central part of a strategy to reduce Iranian influence in the region.\n\nMr. Young has joined with Democrats to craft legislation, hold hearings and write letters aiming to change Saudi and Trump administration behavior in Yemen, where a conflict between Houthi rebels allied with Iran and a Saudi-led coalition has threatened the lives of millions of civilians. He has repeatedly confronted Trump administration and foreign officials important to his political future, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, whom Senate Republicans are hoping will run for Senate in Kansas in 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that I had to resort to that measure,\u201d Mr. Young said in a recent interview, regarding his block of Jennifer Newstead \u2019s nomination to lead the State Department\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser. Days after Mr. Young placed hold, the White House released a statement requesting that Saudi Arabia end its blockade of humanitarian aid\u2014which the country eased within weeks.\n\n\u201cBut we were able to get the attention of the department, and, to my knowledge, the first time the president was briefed on this matter, he acted boldly,\u201d Mr. Young said.\n\nMr. Young, a former Marine officer, said he sees Yemenis without reliable access to food, water and medicine or hit by Saudi strikes as more likely to become radicalized and turn to violence, only increasing Iran\u2019s influence in the region.\n\nBecause of the restrictions Saudi Arabia has placed on aid entering the country and the many civilians killed by Saudi strikes, Mr. Young and many congressional Democrats have focused pressure on the Gulf ally.\n\nBut the Trump administration has been largely unwavering in its support for Saudi leadership\u2014including after Saudi agents brutally murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi \u2014batting down congressional challenges to the relationship. The rest of the Republican leadership in the Senate view efforts to pressure Saudi Arabia as inappropriate during a time of tension with Iran.\n\nDave Harden, a senior official at the U.S. Agency for International Development until last year, said Mr. Young\u2019s activism can only go so far in a conflict as complex as the one in Yemen.\n\nBecause of the restrictions Saudi Arabia has placed on aid entering Yemen and the many civilians killed by Saudi strikes, Sen. Young has focused pressure on the Gulf ally. Photo: AJ Mast for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cFor sure his activism caused it to be discussed a lot. It affected the calculations inside the administration,\u201d he said. \u201cYemen\u2019s a tough, complicated and remote place. We have very, very little influence there.\u201d\n\nAn effort, made with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) in 2018, to require the administration to certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were minimizing civilian deaths and to allow humanitarian aid into Yemen quickly hit obstacles. Mr. Young and Ms. Shaheen castigated Mr. Pompeo\u2019s tardy certification last year, writing that they had significant concerns with the substance of the certification and found it internally inconsistent. Today, Mr. Young is complimentary of how Mr. Pompeo handled the situation, and he says he regularly speaks with the secretary.\n\nThe senator has introduced or supported legislation canceling certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., holding Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for the murder of Mr. Khashoggi and rescinding U.S. military support for the war in Yemen\u2014all in opposition to the administration\u2019s positions. The Saudi government has rejected allegations of the crown prince\u2019s involvement in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really great that Sen. Young has stepped up, but I think most Republicans are unwilling to go against the majority leader and the chairman of the committee,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), who has worked with Mr. Young on a range of foreign-policy initiatives.\n\nWhile he has been a reliable vote to confirm the president\u2019s nominees to State and Defense Department postings, Mr. Young has taken other steps putting him at odds with the administration\u2019s foreign-policy thinking, such as introducing legislation that would rescind previous congressional authorizations for using military force abroad.\n\nMr. Young said leading the NRSC has given him the opportunity to more regularly discuss his priorities with members of the administration. In doing so, Mr. Young is following the advice of the late Richard Lugar, an Indiana Republican who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nMr. Lugar\u2019s decades of foreign-policy work didn\u2019t translate into lasting electoral popularity, though. He lost a primary challenge in 2012. Mr. Young, who worked for Mr. Lugar, is confident that on Yemen he can safely be at odds with Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get a lot of mail or phone traffic that says, don\u2019t be involved in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Young said.\n\nWrite to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com", "description": "In a party where regularly opposing the president often results in a primary challenge or early retirement, Republican Sen.
