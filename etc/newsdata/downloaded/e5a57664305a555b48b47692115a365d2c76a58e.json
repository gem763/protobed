REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nPresident Donald Trump has criticized Amazon for supposedly paying \u201clittle to no taxes\u201d to state and local governments. Now that the e-commerce giant is collecting sales and use tax on behalf of third-party sellers as required by some states, it may need to do even more.\n\nA state tax court decision in South Carolina this week ruled for the first time that Amazon needs to make up for the taxes it hasn\u2019t collected for years. This decision from South Carolina could be an impetus for other states to go after the commerce giant and other online marketplaces for uncollected state taxes.\n\n\u201cI think it would embolden states to move forward on this theory because they've seen at least one court administrative law judge who wrote a very likely decision,\u201d said John Swain, a tax law professor at the University of Arizona.\n\nIn a statement, Amazon said the court decision is \u201cinconsistent with the facts established at trial and the applicable law.\u201d The e-commerce giant has warned investors that states going after it for back taxes like South Carolina could be a blow to its business.\n\n\u201cIf South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter,\u201d Amazon said in its quarterly report in July.\n\nRetroactive tax collection\n\nJob seekers line up to apply during \"Amazon Jobs Day,\" a job fair being held at 10 fulfillment centers across the United States aimed at filling more than 50,000 jobs, at the Amazon.com Fulfillment Center in Fall River, Massachusetts, U.S., August 2, 2017.

But the actual amount could be much larger. It could cover the state\u2019s estimated loss during at least 13 quarters from 2016 to April 2019, according to a spokesperson at the DoR.\n\nSo far, taxation departments in other states haven\u2019t gone to court to collect past tax losses from Amazon. Moreover, Amazon has been able to gain tax exemption in some states in return for its job creation and investment pledges.\n\nWalmart, another retail giant, is fighting a similar battle in Louisiana Supreme Court after a lower court ruled Walmart.com owed Jefferson Parish about $140,000 in uncollected taxes, plus interest and legal fees for uncollected sales tax on its online marketplace.\n\nThere is pushback against states that are trying to collect past taxes. Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank, said \u201cretroactive tax collection from out-of-state sellers and marketplace facilitators is unconstitutional.\u201d But some argue not collecting sales taxes in the past has given online marketplaces like Amazon an unfair price advantage over local businesses. On this basis, Stan Grosz, a California businessman, is suing the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration for its failure to make Amazon pay the state billions in uncollected sales taxes.\n\nFollowing a Supreme Court decision last year that made it easier for states to require merchants to collect sales taxes for online purchases, over 30 states, including South Carolina enacted tax laws to explicitly require online marketplace operators like Amazon to pay state taxes for third-party sellers going forward.\n\nThe South Carolina ruling highlights how states can pressure Amazon to pay for taxes in a past period. The wording in South Carolina\u2019s legislation leaves room for the state to go after Amazon for the past period, according to Professor Swain.", "description": "A ruling from a state tax court in South Carolina could mean a big sales tax bill for Amazon.", "authors": ["Krystal Hu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PKozn6OnoPY.1mebx6pWLA--~B/aD0yMjg1O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/21fcf7c0-d65d-11e9-957b-22437a1da225", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
