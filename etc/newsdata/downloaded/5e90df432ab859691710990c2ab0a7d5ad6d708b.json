As well, expect gains across all markets to slip, as optimism over the prospect of a Brexit deal between the UK and EU\u2014touted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson late last week as a virtual certainty\u2014fades, after the British Parliament deferred Saturday's vote in order to have more time to study the details.\n\nAs a result, Johnson was forced by law to request an extension from the EU, after repeatedly vowing he would not do this. European Council President Donald Tusk will discuss the request with EU leaders, while Johnson plans to try and push the deal through at his end.\n\nLast week, the U.S.'s third quarter earnings season kicked off, with major banks reporting mostly solid earnings versus depressed investor expectations, leading the group and most U.S. benchmarks, higher. Overall, U.S. equities eked out gains on a weekly basis but fell Friday with Boeing (NYSE: ) plunging -6.79% on for the U.S. aerospace giant. Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) losses on Friday allowed Apple (NASDAQ: ) to take back the lead as the world's most highly valued company.\n\nTechnicals Signaling Tops; Economic Data Turns Negative...Again\n\nDow Daily\n\nThe (-0.95%) underperformed on Friday after closing on Thursday just 1.25% below its July 15 record. Boeing (NYSE: ), the most heavily weighted stock on the 30-component mega cap index, accounted for roughly two-thirds of its selloff. The avionics manufacturer which has been in the news for months now, made fresh headlines on Friday after regulators charged that the company neglected to disclose communications between its employees in 2016 during the certification of the now grounded 737 MAX jet.\n\nTechnically, Friday\u2019s trading erased four days of advances, on the highest volume since Oct. 2, when the index dropped 1.8 percent, after nearing record highs. For the week, the Dow retreated 0.2%.\n\nWe pointed out in that fundamentals were improving while technicals were flashing warning signs. Though U.S. corporate earnings thus far have been relatively upbeat, after Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) on Thursday became the latest big bank to about weak growth, technicals on U.S. indices increased chances of topping out.\n\nAlso, economic data flipped negative once again. U.S. disappointed, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) lowered, yet again, its projections for global growth this year from 3.5% to 3%. Traders will also be mulling the data from China, released early Friday, which showed had slowed to 6% in the third quarter, with limited pick-up from domestic demand, but had improved and held up.\n\nMSFT Daily\n\nThe slumped -0.83% on Friday, with Microsoft (-1.63%) leading tech firms lower. Technically, the price neared the neckline of a potential H&S top, whose development was accompanied by falling volume. The tech heavy index gained 0.4% for the week.\n\nUS 10-Y Daily\n\nTreasurys fluctuated but remained unchanged. The U.S. note closed at the top of a symmetrical triangle, situated below the downtrend line since November 2018.\n\nDXY Daily\n\nThe fell for a fourth straight day, after slipping below the bottom of its rising channel since June, closing below the 200 DMA for the first time since July.\n\nGBP/USD Daily\n\nThe pound is expected to plunge when FX trade opens this coming week, unless some drastic new twist toward a Brexit deal materializes. Technically, the pound surged through both the downtrend line since May and its uptrend line since August. Unless a miraculous deal emerges, the pound is likely to retest the broken downtrend line toward 1.2600.\n\nOil Daily\n\nclosed slightly lower after fluctuating throughout Friday's session, finishing at the bottom of a rising flag, bearish after the preceding sharp downturn.
