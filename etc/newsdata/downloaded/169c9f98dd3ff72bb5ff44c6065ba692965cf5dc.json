Why are you punishing us like this?\u201d said 94-year-old Ngasura, the only living survivor of a mass deportation in 1934 from Kericho, where rolling green hillsides ripple with Kenya\u2019s world-famous tea.\n\nIt is a question those forced off their land over decades in Kericho have been asking ever since.\n\nFed up with being ignored, the Kipsigis and Talai peoples have urged a United Nations special investigator to open an inquiry into their plight.\n\nBritish and Kenyan lawyers representing the victims will on Wednesday make their first visit to Kericho since filing an official complaint with the UN, accusing the UK government of failing to account for this colonial-era injustice.\n\nThey allege that the British army and colonial administrators deployed rape, murder and arson to seize swathes of arable land in Kericho from its traditional owners \u2014 rights violations for which nobody has ever answered.\n\nThe victims \u2014 more than 100,000 are signatories to the UN complaint \u2014 want an apology, and reparations for their homeland being usurped and reallocated to white settlers, who turned the fertile soils to cultivating tea.\n\nKericho boasts some of Kenya\u2019s most profitable agricultural land \u2014 but the Kipsigis and Talai say they reap none of the benefit. The land today is largely owned by corporate giants such as Unilever, which sources tea from Kericho for some of its best-selling brands like Lipton.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Blood tea\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe alleged expropriation of land began in the early 20th century but accelerated from the 1920s, after Kericho\u2019s exceptional suitability for tea was realised.\n\n\u201cThere is blood in the tea,\u201d said Godfrey Sang, a historian whose grandfather\u2019s land was doled out to white farmers.\n\n\u201cPeople were killed. Livestock was stolen. Land was taken. Women were raped\u2026 And a crop was planted.\u201d\n\nLawyers pushing for UN special rapporteur Fabian Salvioli to launch an inquiry say the intentional displacement and resettlement of Kipsigis and Talai occurred when Kenya was under the Crown, making the UK responsible under international law.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office, in a statement to AFP, said it supported the work of UN special rapporteurs, and would \u201crespond accordingly\u201d if contacted by Salvioli, the independent expert for the promotion of justice.\n\nThose thrown off their land were herded into so-called \u201cnative reserves\u201d, marginal areas where conditions were often appalling.\n\nIn an extreme case, the entire Talai clan \u2014 hundreds of families, including that of 10-year-old Ngasura \u2014 was deported by decree in 1934 and interned in Gwasi, a barren land two-weeks walk to the west, where malaria was endemic and water scarce.\n\n\u201cLife was so difficult. People were dying,\u201d said Ngasura, speaking through a translator, surrounded by his extended family.\n\nToday, many Kipsigis and Talai live as squatters, humiliated and landless, generations after their forebears were exiled from Kericho\u2019s verdant slopes, land known locally as the \u201cWhite Highlands\u201d.\n\nMost possess nothing more of their past than chunks of pottery and other fragments, unearthed surreptitiously from beneath the tea fields: proof, they say, that their people once lived there.\n\n\u201cIt is very bitter, to see where you used to live, and (know) you were chased away,\u201d said Joel Kimutai Kimetto, staring wistfully at distant hills where his father\u2019s land was razed, and tea planted in its place.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Stolen property\u2019 \u2013\n\nA spokesman for Unilever Kenya Ltd told AFP by email they would not comment on colonial-era claims against the UK. Williamson Fine Tea, and James Finlay Limited, two other multinationals with major tea estates in Kericho, did not reply to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, they need to acknowledge that it is stolen property,\u201d said Kericho County Governor Paul Chepkwony, who has fought for reparations for years.\n\nIn March, they scored a rare victory when Kenya\u2019s National Land Commission ruled that the Kipsigis and Talai did suffer injustices, and recommended the UK apologise.\n\nBut efforts to broker dialogue have not been successful, said Joel Kimutai Bosek, a Kipsigis lawyer representing his people.\n\nThe UK has faced a slew of compensation claims from across its former empire, including from Kenya.\n\nIn 2013, the government paid reparations to victims of its bloody crackdown on the 1950s Mau Mau rebellion against colonial rule in Kenya. But similar appeals have failed.\n\nRodney Dixon QC, a British lawyer representing the Kipsigis and Talai who is visiting Kericho this week, said the UN special rapporteur could assist in mediating a settlement, and had experience investigating long-past historic abuses.\n\n\u201cThis is a precedent that could equally apply here,\u201d Dixon told reporters in Geneva in September.\n\nNgasura, reaching the end of his years, just wants an apology before he dies.\n\n\u201cAfter that, we would shake the hands of the British, and forget the past,\u201d he said.", "description": "Kericho (Kenya) (AFP) \u2013 Kibore Cheruiyot Ngasura was just a small boy when his family was violently expelled from their ancestral land in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/29/9ec8af_verdant-tea-fields-kenya-kericho-british-colonisers-forced-kipsigis-talai-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
