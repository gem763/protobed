Even if we were to believe you that things were being done \"at cost\", it's still a boost to help cover fixed costs of operation. And, of course, there's always things you gain that don't appear on the balance sheet, like improving your brand image, or using this as a marketing opportunity to get repeat business from the diplomats who stay there, etc. But, most importantly, any government employee knows it's completely unethical to arbitrarily grant contracts to your own personal businesses regardless of your motive - it's the very definition of \"corruption\". If it's such a \"great deal\", then simply pass on the facts to an objective 3rd party to handle awarding the contract and let the chips fall where they may. It's actually bad enough that you have \"insider\" knowledge of what selling points are likely to look most favorable to those who are deciding and can pass that on to your company when they're putting together their proposal, or that even with an independent 3rd party it will LOOK like the award was rigged.
