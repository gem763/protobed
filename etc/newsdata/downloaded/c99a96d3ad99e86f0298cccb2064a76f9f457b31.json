That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t watch the debate.", "language": "en", "text": "With this in mind, my choice was easy one recent Thursday evening. I could either watch another so-called debate among an over-large field of would-be presidents, or I could visit the Quality Hill Playhouse in downtown Kansas City, Mo., to hear a concert by Marilyn Maye. One would be a rich and telling barometer of the nation\u2019s past and future, a ray of hope in this uncertain age. The other would be two-plus hours of talk.\n\nMaye is a national treasure; if you haven\u2019t heard of her, it\u2019s because this nation is so rich and profligate in treasures that we lose track of them all the time. Ella Fitzgerald called her \u201cthe greatest white female singer in the world.\u201d Johnny Carson featured her on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d 76 times \u2014 more than any other singer, white, female or otherwise. I remember one show, ages ago, when the man who put America to bed each night turned to the camera after one of Maye\u2019s appearances and said simply: \u201cThat, young singers, is the way it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s enjoying a moment, embraced by fans who weren\u2019t alive when she was nominated for a Grammy as Best New Artist in 1965, an award she lost to a pelvis-thrusting Welsh singer named Tom Jones. Last year, Maye celebrated her 90th birthday with a run of sold-out shows (\u201c90 at Last!\u201d) at Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below club in Manhattan. She returned this year for an eight-night stand she called \u201cMarilyn Maye: I Wish I Were 90 Again!\u201d And she\u2019s booked for next April, too, with a tentative title: \u201c92 and I\u2019m Not Through.\u201d\n\nIndeed, she isn\u2019t. Glittering from head to toe in a dark sequined pantsuit and dazzling earrings, Maye strode onto the Quality Hill stage to feast on the bounty of the Great American Songbook. \u201cI woke up singing this morning, / Got out of the right side of bed,\u201d she breathed, making a shared intimacy of the little-known verse from Jimmy McHugh\u2019s classic, \u201cIt\u2019s a Most Unusual Day.\u201d\n\nFrom those opening words through 90 impeccable minutes, Maye placed her age-ripened voice and musical virtuosity in the service of great lyricists: Alan Jay Lerner, Lorenz Hart, Alan Brandt, Marilyn and Alan Bergman, Harold Arlen and so on. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the lyrics,\u201d she told me after the show, which she performed entirely on her feet, occasionally jumping for emphasis. And after an additional hour, also on her feet, spent greeting her fans, one by one. \u201cYou don\u2019t sing for the audience, you sing to them, and if you don\u2019t add the meaning to the music, it doesn\u2019t come through. There\u2019s a failure to communicate.\u201d\n\nMaye favors medleys woven around timeless themes: songs about happiness, about love, about rainbows (\u201cWhy are there so many songs about rainbows?\u201d). Also songs about betrayal, about heartbreak. The medleys are arranged by her brilliant piano player, Tedd Firth, but she curates them herself from her filing- cabinet brain, packed with thousands of songs. During our interview, she briefly fumbled for the name of a song from Jerry Herman\u2019s 1966 musical, \u201cMame.\u201d Then to find it, she launched into the lyrics, line after perfect line, until at last she came across the embedded title.\n\nBeloved in cabaret hot spots from San Francisco to Palm Springs, Calif., New York to Provincetown, Mass., Maye remains rooted in the Midwest, where the original TV host Steve Allen discovered the Wichita-born singer at a nightclub in postwar Kansas City. I\u2019m wary of regional stereotypes. Yet I can\u2019t help thinking Maye\u2019s earnest and accessible approach is a product of this particular soil. She sings with her heartland on her sleeve. Booked long past her 92nd birthday, her schedule features not just Birdland and Lincoln Center in Manhattan but also gigs in Wamego, Kan., and Lake Okoboji, Iowa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m busier than ever,\u201d she said, a cup of tea in her hand, slippers on her feet, seemingly fresh as the proverbial daisy at the end of a two-show day. Maye\u2019s joy in this fact was contagious, and as I said goodbye, I counted the evening\u2019s pursuit of happiness a smashing success. \u201cHere\u2019s to life,\u201d she\u2019d sung to close her set. \u201cMay all your storms be weathered / And all that\u2019s good get better.\u201d\n\nCome to think of it, that\u2019s pretty sound politics.\n\nRead more from David Von Drehle\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Von Drehle: Trump\u2019s jazz combo of national distraction gets some new members\n\nDavid Von Drehle: American politics could use a healthy dose of pragmatism\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg: The Democratic debates are making me feel better about America\n\nJonathan Capehart: What to do and not do in the Democratic debates\n\nJennifer Rubin: Here\u2019s the problem with the Democratic debates", "description": "A Marilyn Maye concert provided much more joy.", "authors": ["David Von Drehle", "Columnist Focusing On National Affairs"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SAXGSXGWKAI6TBVMB4SQZSIXLA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
