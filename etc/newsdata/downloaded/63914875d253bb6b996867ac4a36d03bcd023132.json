All that can be extracted from the micro factory invented by Prof Veena Sahajwalla.\n\nThe Mumbai-born Sahajwalla, who did her B.Tech in metallurgical engineering from IIT Kanpur in 1986, came up with her pioneering micro factory invention (which is patented) at UNSW, which was launched at the varsity earlier this year.\n\nAccording to Sahajwalla, material science students from India, including one doctoral and one post doctoral, are doing cutting-edge research at UNSW. She also said she would be happy to welcome and train any student with interest in sustainability to enroll at UNSW. Students could include entrepreneurs and graduates from different disciplines of engineering -- civil, material science, textiles, polymers, material sciences.\n\nThe Global E-waste Monitor claims in a report published by the United Nations University that humanity generated 44.7 million metric tons of e-waste in 2016, which is equivalent to 6.1 kilograms per person. According to the report\u2019s findings, just 20 percent of e-waste was properly recycled in 2016.\n\nThe vast majority (80 percent) was undocumented, likely to be dumped, traded or recycled under inferior conditions.", "description": "IIT-trained Indo-Australian scientist Veena Sahajwalla, whose pioneering invention of the world\u2019s first micro factory to tackle e-waste, has generated global attention, says the technology can be deployed at Seelampur and Mayapuri in Delhi to help \u201ckabadiwallas\u201d (waste collectors) make profit by creating value-added products in a safe and sustainable way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2018/Jul/veena_sahajwalla_indoaustralian_scientist_for_ewaste_micro_factory_1531715235_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-16"}
