(AP) - The post-Antonio Brown era is off to a bad start for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nPittsburgh struggled to generate offense in a 33-3 loss at New England on Sunday night in its first game since parting with the four-time All-Pro wide receiver. Without Brown to throw to, Ben Roethlisberger finished 27 of 47 for 276 yards and an interception.\n\nThis time, unlike last season when he publicly criticized Brown\u2019s performance after a Week 12 loss at Denver, the Steelers quarterback shouldered the blame.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d Roethlisberger said. \u201cWasn\u2019t giving guys the balls where they needed to catch \u2018em. Putting them in front (of them), behind, things like that. I wasn\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s only points came on Chris Boswell\u2019s 19-yard field goal early in the second half. Roethlisberger had 161 passing yards through three quarters before dressing up his stats in the fourth, and the Steelers went just 3 for 12 on third down conversions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make more plays for No. 7 (Roethlisberger),\u201d new Steelers receiver Donte Moncrief said. \u201cIt starts with the whole receiver\u2019s room, everybody on offense. We\u2019ve got to be better.\u201d\n\nThe disgruntled Brown was traded to Oakland last March and signed a three-year extension with the Raiders. He requested and was granted his release by Oakland on Saturday after a tumultuous offseason and training camp.\n\nA few hours later, Brown was headed to the Patriots, the Steelers\u2018 top AFC rival.\n\n\u201cMy professional reaction is I really don\u2019t have one,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin told NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d broadcast before the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve been emotionally detached from him for some time now.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s ex-teammates didn\u2019t take the bait on his move to New England, either.\n\n\u201cYou know, that (decision\u2019s) up to him,\u201d said cornerback Mike Hilton, who played with Brown for two seasons. \u201cThat has nothing to do with these guys in the locker room.\u201d\n\nBrown wasn\u2019t the only loss to leave a void in the offense. Two-time All-Pro running back Le\u2019Veon Bell held out all of last season over a contract dispute and signed with the New York Jets during the offseason.\n\nBell\u2019s replacement, third-year back James Conner, had 21 yards on 10 carries and the Steelers managed only 32 rushing yards. Bell rushed for 60 yards and a touchdown for the Jets against Buffalo on Sunday.\n\n\u201cNo need to sugarcoat it - man, we weren\u2019t ready for prime time,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cAll of us, not a good enough plan. Not a good enough execution of that plan. . We won\u2019t go undefeated. We\u2019re 0-1.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The post-Antonio Brown era is off to a bad start for the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gethin Coolbaugh"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/steelers_patriots_football_29072_c0-205-3313-2136_s1770x1032.jpg?0bb34b4bf72d849d1e3c455f8ee67afd48ed2993", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
