Of course we are missing him.\n\n'We have other great players who can replace him in that position.\n\n'Unfortunately, with the injury to John Stones, we have only one natural centre-back.\n\nThe defender will be out of action until the New Year after suffering a knee injury\n\n'I think the team needs to be mentally strong to carry on playing and winning in the championship.'\n\nLiverpool have stolen a march on the champions and are currently eight points clear at the summit after eight games.\n\nJohn Stones is expected back for City on October 19 and his return will be a huge plus for Guardiola as his side look to cut the deficit.", "description": "Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson believes his side are suffering with Aymeric Laporte out injured.
