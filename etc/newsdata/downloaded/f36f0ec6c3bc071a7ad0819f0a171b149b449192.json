It was an arresting goal that will live long in the memory as it evoked memories for United.\n\nRashford scored both United goals and the striker\u2019s importance was underlined by the moment he felt a twinge his leg he was immediately substituted by manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer whose concern was obvious as he put his arm around the 21-year-old. By then the tie was theirs and it means that having struggled for so long United have now won three away games in a week.\n\nThis was by far the most admirable result, away at Stamford Bridge, and ending the run of Frank Lampard\u2019s growing side who, to this point, had earned seven victories in a row in all competitions and were on a roll.\n\nThere may have been many changes, this may be the most junior of the trophies they can compete for, but any win away to Chelsea has to be marked as significant result. United will certainly hope so as they attempt to claw themselves back.\n\nOnce again United won a penalty, their eighth of the season so far but, having missed against Norwich City at the weekend, this time Marcus Rashford made no mistake. It was a nerveless strike low to the right of goalkeeper Willy Caballero with the spot-kick earned mid-way through the first-half when Marcos Alonso charged into Daniel James who had cleverly run across him.", "description": "It remains a long, long way back to the glory days for Manchester United but Marcus Rashford struck a wonderful, Cristiano Ronaldo-style free-kick to defeat Chelsea and earn them a place in the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Rob Bagchi", "Chief Football Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000214647059-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqY4-XNG_7v-V2jIZ3ghNYKAkXbXF73exa4CG7A9Mc8D8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
