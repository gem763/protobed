Adams said New York was gripped by a rat \u201ccrisis\u201d, adding that families were being \u201ctraumatised\u201d by the vermin.\n\nIn July 2017, the city announced a $32m program to cull thousands of rodents by installing rat-resistant rubbish bins and tightening rules on waste. It also tested a liquid bait that made rats infertile.\n\nA rat shot to internet stardom in 2015 when it was filmed walking down the stairs of a subway station with a slice of pizza in its mouth.", "description": "City authorities unveil machine that tempts rats with bait before dropping them into vat of alcohol", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5170e47772fd187350595c61b24a69ad40d4f4e1/148_212_3993_2395/master/3993.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85b89dc3c200cef01c5fd71c1c910a6f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
