Underlying inflation has been as projected. Global uncertainty persists, and interest rates abroad are very low. At the same time, the weak krone may result in higher inflation ahead,\u201d Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement on Thursday. The bank kept its benchmark deposit rate at 1.5%, as expected by all economists surveyed by Bloomberg.\n\nThe announcement comes as Sweden\u2019s Riksbank signaled it was committing to a December hike that would bring its main rate to 0%.\n\nNorway\u2019s October rate decision was a so-called interim meeting, and the bank didn\u2019t provide new economic forecasts. Policy makers raised rates last month for a fourth time in a year, as Norway breaks away from the pack. In September, Olsen said the bank would keep interest rates \u201cat this level in the coming period.\u201d\n\nBacked by the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, Norway\u2019s central bank has avoided unconventional monetary policies, including negative rates. Norges Bank has instead adopted a policy of \u201cleaning against the wind,\u201d keeping rates a little higher than economic conditions warrant to prevent a buildup imbalances.\n\nMeanwhile, Norway\u2019s conservative-led government has propped up the economy by plowing historic amounts of the country\u2019s oil wealth back into the economy to support growth. The government plans to spend almost $30 billion of its oil cash next year to cover budget needs.", "description": "Norway Sticks With Decision to Pause Hikes; Warns of Weak Krone", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica8292b0d0741d1370b2b19411b1ff192.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
