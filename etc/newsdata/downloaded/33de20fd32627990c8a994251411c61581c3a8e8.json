Now it\u2019s just 600-700,\u201d said the 31-year-old.\n\nRoberts, though, feels that whatever happens, the islanders\u2019 \u201cnatural sort of pragmatism and sense of spirit\u201d will help them find a way to survive.", "description": "Stanley (Falkland Islands) (AFP) \u2013 It may be a remote archipelago 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometres) from mainland Britain but the Falkland", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/ceecb2_king-penguins-sheep-are-volunteer-point-north-stanley-in-falkland-islands-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
