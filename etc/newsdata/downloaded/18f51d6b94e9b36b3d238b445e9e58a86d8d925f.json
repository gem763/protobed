The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, -1.35% was down 5.4 basis points to 1.747%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, -2.38% slipped 7 basis points to 2.304%.\n\nIn the previous week, the 10-year note staged its biggest weekly rise since 2013, while the shorter-dated 2-year note logged its largest weekly climb since 2009.\n\nSee: Why the Saudi oil attack is a \u2018big deal\u2019 that could be a \u2018game changer\u2019 in stock markets and crude prices\n\nRead: Oil\u2019s 10% surge after Saudi attack puts it on track for the biggest daily gain in 3\u00bd years\n\nWhat\u2019s driving Treasurys?\n\nGeopolitical jitters and global economic uncertainty resurfaced after an attack devastated sections of Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq oil refining plant and a nearby crude field, drawing attention to the vulnerability of oil production facilities in the Middle East. Estimates suggest that up to 50% of the Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production could briefly knocked offline.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, +10.08%, the U.S. benchmark contract, rose 8.2% at $59.39 a barrel on Monday.\n\nInvestors flocked toward bonds as risk assets were set to sag at the start of the week.

Oil prices spiked higher but drifted down into the European open,\u201d wrote Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n\n\u201cHowever, even for those who aren\u2019t skeptical about Saudi claims to be able to restore a third of the lost output as early as today, there is bound to be a higher risk premium attached to prices going forwards. Slower global growth was beginning to act as a drag on oil prices, but the risk premium goes the other way and that in turn is another drag on global growth,\u201d said Juckes.", "description": "Treasury yields fall Monday, reversing a chunk of last week\u2019s surge, after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities sends oil prices higher.", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
