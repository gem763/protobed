[HYUNDAI MOBIS]\n\nHyundai Mobis and KT demonstrated 5G-based connected-car technologies Tuesday at the Hyundai Mobis test site in Seosan, South Chungcheong.At the event, the companies showcased cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) technologies, including real-time updates for the navigation system, a 5G video streaming service for emergency situations and collision prevention systems that stop the vehicle when faced by an obstacle and recognize and avoid construction sites and pedestrians.C-V2X is considered a core technology for self-driving vehicles and connected cars.Connected cars are automobiles equipped with internet access, which allows them to connect with other cars, pedestrians and surrounding infrastructure via the Internet to share data.Hyundai Mobis and KT signed an initial agreement to co-develop related projects in August 2018.During the demonstration Tuesday, vehicles lacking a direct line of sight to accidents and obstacles were able to detect them using the 5G network for the receiving and sharing real-time of real-time traffic information to avoid accidents.\u201cThrough synergy with KT, which has the world\u2019s best 5G communications technology, we could secure high-quality technology in a short amount of time,\u201d said Chang Jae-ho, senior vice president and head of the electrical and electronics R&D division at Hyundai Mobis.\u201cWe will strengthen the partnership between the two companies to make connected-car technology more trustworthy and realize the age of safe and accident-less future cars.\u201dAfter KT, the country\u2019s second-largest wireless service provider, installed 5G-related infrastructure at the test site, Hyundai Mobis, with support from Hyundai MnSoft, developed and installed related technologies for the testing of vehicles and systems.During the partnership, Hyundai Mobis developed a technology that allows sensors to collect nearby traffic data and transfer key information to others through the connected network system.The KRX-listed auto parts maker said it has been able to successfully test five crucial connected-car technologies.Hyundai Mobis said the company will continue working with KT to develop a remote monitoring system using the 5G network to manage self-driving cars on regular roads.Data compiled from additional tests on the roads will be used by the two companies to enhance related technologies.Hyundai Mobis will be in charge of constructing monitoring systems and data-sharing servers.KT will be supporting the project by installing necessary devices and supporting connections, data transfer and synchronization using the 5G network.BY KO JUN-TAE [ko.juntae@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22195321.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
