But cracks, even if slight, are beginning to show in his support.\n\nThe 78-year-old singer who rose to stardom as a tenor has been confirmed to sing the baritone title role in \u201cNabucco\u201d at the Zurich Opera House in Switzerland on Sunday.\n\nIt will be Domingo\u2019s first performance since he stepped down Oct. 2 as general director of the Los Angeles Opera and withdrew from future performances at the company.\n\nThe move left the star with no more U.S. dates on his public calendar, putting a question mark over his professional future in a country where he thrived artistically for decades.\n\nIn addition to LA Opera, three U.S. musical companies already had canceled Domingo performances, and he also pulled out of a series of appearances at New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera under pressure.\n\nThe U.S. response has been relatively decisive in the wake of a pair of reports by The Associated Press in August and September based on interviews with more than 20 women who accused Domingo of sexual harassment or other inappropriate contact.\n\nDomingo has denied the allegations.\n\nIn contrast to the United States, so far no theater in Europe, where the #MeToo movement has had little impact, has canceled any of the singer\u2019s planned performances on calendars running through the fall of 2020.\n\nIn continuing the performances, European venues have cited an absence of allegations in their venues, the lack of a judicial case against him and the singer\u2019s well-known affability and undeniable popularity.\n\nNo investigations have been announced in Europe, although some houses say they are awaiting the outcome of one being conducted at LA Opera, suggesting possible future action depending on the findings.\n\nEven as the Zurich Opera confirmed again last week that Domingo would sing the role of Nabucco in what it has been billed as \u201ca really special gala performance,\u201d the Swiss venue emphasized that it continues to monitor the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have given a lot of thought about the upcoming performance of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo as Nabucco on 13 October and we take the matter very seriously,\u201d spokeswoman Bettina Auge said in an email. \u201cThe Zurich Opera commits to establishing a work environment which is free of sexual harassment.\u201d\n\nAuge added, \u201cFor us the presumption of innocence is very important.\u201d\n\nEven before Domingo removed himself from the Los Angeles opera, the opera critic for Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper wrote that that singer\u2019s \u201ctotal withdrawal from the Metropolitan Opera in the wake of continuing sexual harassment allegations against him ought to mark a line in the sand for the operatic world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem, however, is that when the world of opera is confronted with an expanse of sand, its instinct is to bury its head in it,\u201d the Guardian\u2019s Martin Kettle wrote last month. The headline for Kettle\u2019s column said London\u2019s Royal Opera House \u201cis living in a dream world if it thinks Domingo should perform there still.\u201d\n\nDomingo isn\u2019t scheduled to sing at the Royal Opera House until the July 2020 production of \u201cDon Carlo.\u201d Cast to sing the baritone part of Rodrigo, it would mark his 28th role there since 1971.\n\nThe opera house, called Covent Garden for short due to its location in the London district of that name, previously said it wasn\u2019t aware of any accusations from his earlier appearances there and expressed a \u201czero tolerance policy towards harassment of any kind.\u201d\n\nThis week, the Royal Opera declined to comment further when asked if there were any changes in the calendar in the wake of the U.S. developments.\n\n\u201cIt would not be appropriate for us to comment before the conclusion of the formal investigation into Placido Domingo in Los Angeles,\u201d it said.\n\nIn all, Domingo has been confirmed to appear in 17 European concerts or operas through November 2020, including a 50th anniversary concert at Milan\u2019s La Scala on Dec. 15 and four appearances at the Vienna State Opera House - three operas and a youth gala concert.\n\nAnd the Teatro Real in his native Madrid is sticking by him, reiterating an earlier statement that expressed no tolerance for violence against women and said such matters must be dealt with by a court.\n\nThe singer\u2019s hometown theater added, \u201cWe, as many people, think that Placido Domingo is an unquestionable artist with more than half a century of career as one of the most important voices in the lyrical genre.\u201d\n\n____\n\nJamey Keaten contributed from Geneva, Switzerland and Aritz Parra from Madrid.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Even as his U.S. career seemingly winds down amid accusations of sexual harassment, opera legend Placido Domingo remains on the bill of a host of European opera houses.
