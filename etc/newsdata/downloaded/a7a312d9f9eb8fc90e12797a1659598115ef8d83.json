The breakdown of rule of law is often caused by a rise in crime and a failure to control it.\n\n\n\nBased on the increasing regularity of reports on shootings, stabbings, rapes and human trafficking committed by criminal illegal aliens and the refusal of \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions to restrain it, Americans are justifiably worried about personal and community safety; their comfort resides in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nArticle I unequivocally provides the federal government with sole power to \u201cestablish Naturalization.\u201d Article 4 further reads, \"The United States shall protect [States] against Invasion; and \u2026 domestic Violence.\u201d\n\nAs sanctuary states and jurisdictions illegitimately usurp lawful power from the federal government, the last thing they are doing is protecting against \u201cdomestic Violence.\u201d Instead, they are overtly allowing it and tacitly encouraging it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nResponsibility for locating and removing individuals illegally in our country rests with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE.) Under ICE\u2019s federal 287(g) Program, it has authority to partner with state and local law agencies for assistance with immigration enforcement.\n\nHowever, power for such enforcement does not lie with states or cities. They cannot opt out of federal immigration laws any more than they can opt out of federal discrimination laws.\n\nYet irresponsible sanctuary rules don\u2019t just prevent federal law enforcement from removing criminals from our midst, they also block local law enforcement officers from their primary duty to keep the public safe.\n\nSanctuary proponents claim illegal immigrants do not commit most crimes. This is not only a specious argument, but it does it even really matter? How many murder or sexual assault victims are enough to persuade liberal politicians that sanctuary is a bad idea? One, ten, a thousand?\n\nEach crime committed by an illegal alien has the unique characteristic of being fully preventable. As former Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsTrump attacks Sessions: A 'total disaster' and 'an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama' Ocasio-Cortez fires back at Washington Times after story on her 'high-dollar hairdo' Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy MORE noted in 2018; \u201cthe illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero.\u201d Sanctuary supporters make deflective arguments. Statistics and heartbreak prove the danger of rogue orders for local law enforcement to ignore lawful ICE directives to remove dangerous illegal immigrants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA recent report from the Department of Justice found that in 2017, there were 105,200 non-citizens in federal or state prisons, each costing American workers more than $36K per inmate per year, not including thousands being held in on-going court cases. Most state data make it difficult to discern how many prisoners are here illegally vs. legal non-citizens, but the self-evident answer is \u201ca lot.\u201d\n\nTexas keeps accurate records and has reported that between 2010 and 2019, illegal aliens were charged with thousands of property crimes, 586 homicides and 8,972 sexual assaults. These represent more than 500 grieving families and nearly 9,000 traumatized victims in one state alone.\n\nDuring a forty-five-day period in 2019 in the sanctuary county of Montgomery, Maryland, nine illegal immigrants were charged with multiple sexual assaults. In the case of one alleged violent rape by an illegal immigrant, County Executive Marc Erich instructed jailers to let ICE know if the accused made bond but not delay his release so ICE could detain him.\n\nAn illegal alien accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl and her younger brother told police the assault was \u201ca cultural joke common in El Salvador.\u201d In that case, Montgomery District Judge Patricia Mitchell issued the accused a $15,000 no-cash-down bond.\n\nAn illegal immigrant in Seattle raped a wheelchair bound woman in 2018 and served nine months. Upon his 2019 release, Judge Nicole Gaines Phelps ordered him back to Mexico but refused to report the release to ICE, deliberately preventing his deportation proceeding. This predator returned to the home of the disabled woman, raping and beating her again, in front of her child.\n\nSanctuary policy is a proven threat to decent people. Despite high media visibility of many criminal illegal alien victims \u2014 Kate Steinle, Mollie Tibbetts, Deputy Ryan Thompson \u2014 it seems no victim list is long enough to bring sanctuary proponents to their senses.\n\nEven today, the prescience of the Founders is evident. They could not foresee an influx of more than 11 million people illegally breaching our sovereign borders, yet they made provision for this flagrant violation in the documents that guide and define our union of fifty states and a federal government.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE has acknowledged this crisis and taken corrective action through executive orders and requests to Congress. The White House is calling for \u201can immigration system that serves the national interest\u201d\u2014 and idea that sanctuary jurisdictions reject.\n\nIt is time for even the most liberal of citizens residing in sanctuary areas to publicly challenge this deadly doctrine that elevates criminal illegal immigrants over legal residents and could bring anarchy to our doorsteps.\n\nAmbassador Ken Blackwell is a senior fellow at the American Civil Rights Union (ACRU) and a member of its Policy Board.
