That means narrowly tailored to address an identifiable problem.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis comments follow the Met\u2019s move to ban any assembly linked to the XR \u2018Autumn Uprising\u2019 under Section 14 of the Public Order Act, from 9pm last night.\n\nOfficers started removing the environmental group out of Trafalgar Square yesterday after more than a week of disruption, with more protesters leaving the Vauxhall Gardens site today.\n\nPolice officers stand on near patches of light coloured grass, marking the ground where activists\u2019 tents used to be at Vauxhall Gardens (Picture: AFP)\n\nActivists carry their belongings away from the site \u2013 but many say other items have been seized (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Shadow Home Secretary, Diane Abbott, and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, have already raised concerns about the decision, which has drawn widespread criticism.\n\nIn a statement, the Met\u2019s Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor justified the stringent conditions because of \u2018continued breaches of the section 14 condition previously implemented, and ongoing serious disruption to the community.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018Yesterday, protesters targeted areas in the City of London, causing further disruption to people and businesses in London\u2019s financial district.\n\n\u2018Since the beginning of this operation officers have been working hard to keep London moving.\n\n\u2018The policing operation continues, and we will continue to take action against anyone engaged in unlawful protests at locations targeted by Extinction Rebellion.\u2019\n\nEx-boxer Ricky Hatton gives Paul Gascoigne character reference in court\n\nBut Professor Mead, a former solicitor and an expert on protest, put further doubt on the legitimacy of the move, which follows 1,457 arrests (as of 8.45am this morning) since protests began.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018There are I think other legal issues that the Met would have to overcome, largely relating to the certainty of the target assembly. Human rights law requires that where restrictions are imposed, then protesters are entitled to know with sufficient certainty if they are affected. I am not sure that\u2019s the case here.\n\n\u2018While it might (but quite possibly not) be lawful to bring this one specific assembly to an end by imposing a condition, it cannot lawfully be used to impose an effective ban on all assemblies in London, which on one reading the notice seeks to.\u2019\n\nHe added that decisions involving the Home Secretary are \u2018far more politically accountable\u2019.\n\nLegal expert Professor Mead (Picture: David Mead)\n\nXR demonstrators gather their belongings from Vauxhall Gardens (Picture: AFP)\n\nThis is the ninth day of demonstrations by the climate change action group (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Home Office said using Section 14 was an operational decision for the police.\n\nA spokesperson added: \u2018The right to protest peacefully is a long-standing tradition in this country and a vital foundation of our democracy. It is also essential that people can go about their daily business without disruption.\u2019\n\nLabelling the ruling \u2018completely ludicrous and extremely alarming\u2019, Kevin Blowe, a Coordinator of the Network for Police Monitoring (Netpol), said: \u2018Normally, banning a protest in its entirety in London requires the approval of the Home Secretary, but is rare and undoubtedly controversial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The police are trying to side-step this by using their wide-ranging powers in a way that we believe is unreasonable, disproportionate and therefore a breach of rights to freedom of assembly and expression protected by the European Convention on Human Rights.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018If Netpol decided to stand outside New Scotland Yard today with a banner saying \u201cprotect our rights to protest\u201d, it is likely nothing would happen to us. If, however, individuals came and stood with us displaying any item that has Extinction Rebellion\u2019s name or branding on it, they would very likely face arrest.\u2019\n\nDr Michelle Farrell, a Senior Lecturer in Law at the University of Liverpool, said the police action \u2018almost certainly fails to meet the legal requirements of necessity and proportionality, obligations that the police must comply with under the Human Rights Act and European Convention on Human Rights\u2019.\n\nShe added: \u2018The police have failed to establish a legitimate aim for imposing this section 14 order; getting \u201cLondon moving again\u201d does not cut the mustard legally speaking.\n\n\u2018The police have not shown in any credible way how the XR Autumn Uprising as a whole raises a general risk of serious public disorder or serious disruption to the life of the community, and, moreover, they have not shown why this general ban is necessary rather than more restrictive targeted measures.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Met were asked to respond to Professor Mead\u2019s comments.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
