It\u2019s the same place where Reince Priebus and Gen. John Kelly found themselves, despite each having a wildly different management style and philosophical approache to the chief of staff job. Trump sidelined all three of them, even after Mulvaney made nice with his family and adopted his \u201clet Trump be Trump\u201d ethos.\n\n\u201cMick is lying low, but everyone is lying low,\u201d a former senior administration official said. \u201cWhite House aides are hoping the president deals with this himself, and everyone is trying to keep their heads down.\u201d\n\n\u201cPopping your head up will only lead to bad things,\u201d this person said. \u201cIt\u2019s uncommon for a chief to do this as well, but Mick seems to be in the same shelter-in-place posture everyone is in.\u201d\n\nMuch of the White House staff is paralyzed by Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, as Trump keeps changing the administration\u2018s strategy on the fly and directs it from his own reactive Twitter feed. The president and his lawyers have taken control of the scorched-earth impeachment fight as advisers, White House staff and outside allies keep offering advice to fight Democrats and stonewall their investigation. Like Mulvaney, many of the aides know it\u2019s best to follow the president\u2019s lead in these high-risk situations.\n\n\u201cThe central question here is: Where is Mick Mulvaney?\u201d said Chris Whipple, author of \u201cThe Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency.\u201d \u201cHe's abdicated the most important duty as White House chief of staff, and that is telling the president what he doesn't want to hear. And the most dramatic result of his \u2018Let Trump be Trump\u2019 posture is the Ukraine scandal. He should have thrown his body in front of that phone call.\u201c\n\nSeveral current and former White House aides insist Mulvaney\u2019s job is safe, partly because the president would not be able to find anyone to assume the chief of staff duties amid impeachment proceedings and partly because Mulvaney is too enmeshed in the Ukraine scandal to end up unceremoniously dumped by Trump.\n\nThe president is deeply frustrated with the media coverage and pace of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, but that irritation extends to many corners of the West Wing, said 16 current and former senior administration officials and allies to both Trump and Mulvaney, who were granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal reactions to the looming impeachment threat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern any impeachment strategy whatsoever, so it makes it really hard to judge what Mulvaney is or isn\u2019t doing,\u201d Whipple said. \u201cPodesta was extremely effective during President [Bill] Clinton's impeachment \u2014 he called himself the \u2018secretary of shit.\u2018 [H.R.] Haldeman, not so much. So Mulvaney\u2018s somewhere in that spectrum, but he\u2018s a lot closer to Haldeman than he is to Podesta.\u201c Haldeman was President Richard Nixon's chief of staff during Watergate.\n\nTwo senior administration officials insisted Mulvaney\u2019s standing inside the White House is fine. Still, the president\u2019s tendency to change his mind rapidly and unpredictably has created an atmosphere of uncertainty for nearly everyone around him \u2014 including Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cThis is the point in Trumpworld where they figure out who to blame,\u201d a second former administration official said.\n\nA spokesman for Mulvaney did not comment, while the White House press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMulvaney allies said the acting chief is content to maintain a low profile and help the president as the Democratic proceedings unfold, but they said he would be ready to make a graceful exit if he senses Trump is preparing to make him a scapegoat or if the chaos inside the White House becomes unsustainable. One former Trump aide recalled his time in the administration this way: \u201cYou learn how to walk and chew gum even when stuff is blowing up around you, but eventually it becomes too much for everyone.\u201d", "description": "Mick Mulvaney has gone noticeably quiet over the past week, just as the president\u2019s impeachment fight picks up.
