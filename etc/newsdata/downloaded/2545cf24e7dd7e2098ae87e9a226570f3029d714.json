REUTERS/Mark Kauzlarich\n\nRepublicans Joe Walsh and Bill Weld made the comments as the U.S. House of Representatives planned to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump over reports he sought Ukrainian help to smear Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cThe Ukraine caper by the president is some combination of treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d said Weld, a former Massachusetts governor. \u201cThe one thing that\u2019s absolutely clear is it is grounds for removal from office.\u201d\n\nWalsh, a radio talk-show host and former U.S. congressman from Illinois, agreed.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is unfit,\u201d he said during a debate hosted by the website Business Insider. \u201cThe president of the United States will deserve to be impeached very soon.\u201d\n\nThe event in New York was not sanctioned by the Republican Party, which has thrown its full support behind Trump. He did not participate and also called the impeachment inquiry \u201cWitch Hunt garbage\u201d on Twitter.\n\nTrump has dismissed his challengers as a \u201cjoke\u201d and \u201claughingstock.\u201d\n\nAsked to explain Trump\u2019s decision not to participate in the debate, Erin Perrine, a deputy communications director for the Trump campaign, said, \u201cPointless.\u201d\n\nFormer South Carolina governor and congressman Mark Sanford, the third Republican challenging Trump, said he missed the debate because of a scheduling conflict.\n\nWalsh, Weld and Sanford have complained about being shut out of the nomination contest. Republican Party officials in Alaska, Arizona, Kansas, Nevada and South Carolina already have said they would not host nominating contests in their states next year, cutting off chances for the challengers to win delegates who will choose the Republican candidate at the party\u2019s convention. The Republican nominee will face the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate in the November 2020 election.\n\nA Sept. 16-20 Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 82% of registered Republicans approved of Trump\u2019s job performance, while a similar poll this week found that 37% of the American public thinks Trump should be impeached, down from 41% in a similar poll earlier in September.\n\nWalsh, 57, served in the House of Representatives for two years and then became a radio talk-show host. Weld, 74, touts a fiscally conservative record as well as his work on gay rights and environmental issues. He ran unsuccessfully for vice president in 2016 on the Libertarian Party\u2019s ticket.", "description": "Two of the three Republicans challenging Donald Trump for their party's presidential nomination backed an effort to impeach the U.S. president during a debate on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433564566&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O032", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
