The Getty Center\u2019s art collection was not evacuated, however, due to design features in the hilltop building that withstand fire.\n\nThe new Getty Fire likewise has forced the closure of some southbound roads. Officials have also ordered the mandatory evacuation of several neighborhoods to the west of the fire. Residents in a wider area received alerts at roughly 2:45 a.m. advising them to prepare to evacuate if necessary. Firefighters said the Getty Center itself was not threatened. (A spot fire on the Getty Center property was later reported.)\n\nUpdate #BrushFire; INC#0074; 4:45AM; Sb 405 Fy; https://t.co/JNEbaPHrIh; ##GettyFire; New MANDATORY Evacuation zone: The current zone is extending to the west. Sullivan Fire Road is the new western border, Chautauqua Blvd down to \u2026 https://t.co/yi01ojJAwz \u2014 LAFD (@LAFD) October 28, 2019\n\nLos Angeles officials determined that the Skirball fire was not deliberately set, but was caused by a cooking fire, which spread rapidly in high winds. At the time, many said the city had to take action against the spread of homelessness.\n\nHowever, in the two years since then, the population of homeless people in Los Angeles has surged, rising 12 percent from 2018 to 2019.\n\nThe cause of the Getty Fire is not yet known.\n\nThe Skirball fire was also notable for the first use of drones by L.A. firefighters.\n\nJoel B.
