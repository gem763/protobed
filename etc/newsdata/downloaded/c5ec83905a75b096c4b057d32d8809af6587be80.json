Google said it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing research, saying its quantum processor has completed a calculation in just a few minutes that would take a traditional supercomputer thousands of years to finish.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Google said it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing research, saying an experimental quantum processor has completed a calculation in just a few minutes that would take a traditional supercomputer thousands of years.\n\nThe findings, published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature, show that \u201cquantum speedup is achievable in a real-world system and is not precluded by any hidden physical laws,\u201d the researchers wrote.\n\nQuantum computing is a nascent and somewhat bewildering technology for vastly sped-up information processing. Quantum computers might one day revolutionize tasks that would take existing computers years, including the hunt for new drugs and optimizing city and transportation planning.\n\nThe technique relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can register data values of zero and one \u2014 the language of modern computing \u2014 simultaneously. Big tech companies including Google GOOG, -0.27% , Microsoft MSFT, -1.49% , IBM IBM, +1.04% and Intel INTC, -0.23% are avidly pursuing the technology.\n\n\u201cQuantum things can be in multiple places at the same time,\u201d said Chris Monroe, a University of Maryland physicist who is also the founder of quantum startup IonQ. \u201cThe rules are very simple, they\u2019re just confounding.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s findings, however, are already facing pushback from other industry researchers. A version of Google\u2019s paper leaked online last month and researchers caught a glimpse before it was taken down.\n\nIBM quickly took issue with Google\u2019s claim that it had achieved \u201cquantum supremacy,\u201d a term that refers to a point when a quantum computer can perform a calculation that a traditional computer can\u2019t complete within its lifetime. Google\u2019s leaked paper showed that its quantum processor, Sycamore, finished a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds \u2014 and that it would take the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to do the same thing.\n\nBut IBM researchers say that Google underestimated the conventional supercomputer, called Summit, and said it could actually do the calculation in 2.5 days. Summit was developed by IBM and is located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.\n\nGoogle has not commented on IBM\u2019s claims.\n\nWhether or not Google has achieved \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d or not may matter to competitors, but the semantics could be less important for the field of quantum research. What it does seem to indicate is that the field is maturing.\n\n\u201cThe quantum supremacy milestone allegedly achieved by Google is a pivotal step in the quest for practical quantum computers,\u201d John Preskill, a Caltech professor who originally coined the \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d term, wrote in a column after the paper was leaked.\n\nIt means quantum computing research can enter a new stage, he wrote, though a significant effect on society \u201cmay still be decades away.\u201d\n\nThe calculation employed by Google has little practical use, Preskill wrote, other than to test how well the processor works. Monroe echoed that concern.\n\n\u201cThe more interesting milestone will be a useful application,\u201d he said.", "description": "Google said it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing research, saying an experimental quantum processor has completed a calculation in just a few...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT827_google_ZG_20191023062702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
