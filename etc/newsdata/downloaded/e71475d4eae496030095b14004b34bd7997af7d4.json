Martin (@ByKimberleyA) September 12, 2019\n\nNow, just four days before the Jets and Browns face each other on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d it was Beckham delivering a mighty blow.\n\nThe receiver \u2014 who was traded from New York to Cleveland in March \u2014 suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 2 of the Giants\u2019 2017 preseason season when he was hit low by then-Browns cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here]\n\n\u201cNobody in the NFL is really out to do stuff like that. I had players on this team telling me that\u2019s what he was telling them to do: Take me out of the game and it\u2019s preseason. You just know who he is.\u201d\n\nAs a Giant, Odell Beckham was cut down by Browns strong safety Briean Boddy-Calhoun in a 2017 preseason game. (AP)\n\nThat injury cost Beckham the Giants\u2019 season opener. But, according to him, Williams cost him much more.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what it did,\u201d said Beckham, who said he tried to come back from the injury too soon and subsequently broke the ankle. He later underwent surgery and missed the majority of the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cI came back too early for my team. I gave them all I had, even though I knew I was three weeks out. I came back probably three weeks early because they had lost the first game of the season last year and I felt that pressure to be able to come out there and do what I can to help the team. \u2026\n\n\u201cIf God wouldn\u2019t have blessed me the way that I am, I would have blown my knee in that preseason game if I could\u2019t have gotten my foot out the ground. And that high-ankle sprain led to the broken ankle on the left, which led to compensation in a different area, so it was kind of like a little spiral.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s something that I\u2019ll never forget. It changed my life forever. I don\u2019t necessarily regret it. Of course, I wish it didn\u2019t happen, but it did. That led to the ankle, for sure.\u201d\n\nHe also blamed Williams \u2014 and that crucial Boddy-Calhoun hit \u2014 for the subsequent torn quadricep muscle he suffered last year with the Giants.\n\n\u201cI ended up catching a nasty hematoma last year. Banged up and I just tried to play through it,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 I was running an out-and-up, I stuck on the up and my quad just tore and it was torn the entire back end of the season and there was really nothing I could do about it. \u2026 I wish I could have finished the season but I couldn\u2019t. I just did my best to be a team player, traveled with the team. I just tried to be there for those guys however I can. That\u2019s just the person I am.\u201d\n\nWilliams became synonymous with the infamous bounty scandal in 2012. Then the defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints, Williams paid players money for injuring opponents.\n\nWilliams is expected to address the New York media on Friday.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "\u201cIf I was a coach, I would never teach what he teaches.
