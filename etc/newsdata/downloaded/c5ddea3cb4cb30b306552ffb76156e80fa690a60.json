Supporting me. And all the time...she killed our dad,\" confessed Tracy.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nVanessa claimed she could not go around throwing more accusations, having wrongly pointed the finger at Dawn before, but Tracy was adamant she had got the truth.\n\nRevealing how Kerry came to be fighting for her life, Tracy said: \"Cause I grabbed her, she just...sort of tripped over. Banged her head. It's no more than she deserved. I'm not apologising for it.\"\n\nLater on, Tracy went to the hospital, but furious Amy screamed at her to leave.\n\n(Image: itv)\n\n(Image: itv)\n\nAngry Emmerdale viewers slammed everyone for making Tracy out to be the bad guy.\n\nTaking to Twitter, one viewer said: \"Tracy is not the villain here!!!!
