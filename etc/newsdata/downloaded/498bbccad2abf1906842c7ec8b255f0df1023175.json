The Post was among the media outlets to obtain Taylor\u2019s testimony given behind closed doors in the House\u2019s impeachment probe of Trump.\n\nSee link to testimony from the Post.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Democrats called Taylor\u2019s testimony \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe testimony is very disturbing,\u201d said New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney. Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota used the same word. Asked why, he said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s becoming more distinct.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s appearance is among the most watched because of a text message, released by House investigators earlier in the probe, in which he called Trump\u2019s attempt to leverage military aid to Ukraine in return for a political investigation \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s description of Trump\u2019s position is in sharp contrast to how the president has characterized it. Trump has said many times that there was no quid pro quo, though his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney contradicted that last week. Mulvaney later tried to walk back his remarks.\n\nAlso see: Trump compares impeachment inquiry to lynching, drawing condemnation.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor reportedly said Tuesday he was told release of military aid depended on public declarations from Kyiv that...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT774_willia_ZG_20191022094623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
