Rescue vessels found themselves stranded at sea, hoping that a country would open its gates and other countries would then take in the rescued asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cI find crucial that we move away from a ship-to-ship arrangement,\u201d said Maria Ohisalo, the interior minister of Finland, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU.\n\nThe paper that will be presented to other member states \u201cis a pilot case, limited in time and focused on disembarkations after search and rescue operations ... ensuring swift relocation of asylum seekers on a voluntary basis to other member states,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the agreement reached in Malta contains some words \u2014 such as \u201cquotas\u201d and \u201cmandatory\u201d \u2014 that have caused problems in the past. It may also prove controversial because it refers repeatedly to asylum seekers and migrants, rather than to refugees, which could open the scheme up to people less likely to be granted international protection for reasons such as persecution or war.\n\n\u201cThere are concrete proposals and I'm very satisfied,\u201d new Italian Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese told reporters. Germany has publicly announced that it is ready to take in a quarter of the asylum seekers rescued, but Lamorgese said quotas will be set only once it is clear how many countries will take part in the relocation scheme.\n\nOne of the points agreed upon in Malta is the controversial \u201cvoluntary rotation of ports\u201d where asylum seekers will disembark, she said.\n\nAnother key aspect is that participation will be voluntary but, once quotas are agreed, \u201crelocation will be mandatory,\u201d the Italian minister said. Diplomats from other countries confirmed this aspect of the scheme. It was a mandatory aspect of a previous relocation scheme for refugees, launched in 2015 at the peak of the migration crisis, that infuriated Central European countries such as Hungary and Poland.\n\nThe other step that could upset countries opposed to mandatory relocation is that \u201cwe talk about asylum seekers [not refugees] and you have to take into account that 99 percent [of those arriving] are asylum seekers,\u201d Lamorgese said.", "description": "Scheme will be temporary and voluntary.", "authors": ["Jacopo Barigazzi", "Imogen Sudbery"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170369750-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
