Any confrontation between the two naval forces risked escalation into nuclear war.\n\nThe operators in the Scarborough bunker were able to intercept the Soviet ships reporting back their position and establish where they were heading.\n\n\"Traditionally just another task at the bottom of Scarborough's priority list, suddenly escalated to the very top priority for British intelligence,\" Tony Comer, GCHQ's historian told the BBC.", "description": "The pivotal role in the Cuban missile crisis played by a secret outpost of GCHQ in Scarborough has been revealed.", "authors": ["Dominic Nicholls", "Defence", "Security Correspondent", "Stephen Pollard"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/21/TELEMMGLPICT000213659828-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
