Not having been weaned on Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood, Fred Rogers\u2019 beloved children\u2019s program, which ran, with a few interruptions, from the \u201860s to the early 21st century, my eyes don\u2019t tear up at the mere mention of his name or references to some of his puppet friends such as King Friday XIII and Daniel the Tiger. My taste in escapist entertainment enjoyed by children\u2014although not necessarily made exclusively for them\u2014is more aligned to the subversive humor of Chuck Jones\u2019s Looney Tunes than a program in which a kindly gentleman in a sweater issues bromides that seemed culled from the arsenal of a liberal Protestant minister (and Fred Rogers was in fact an ordained minister, although one who refrained from mentioning God on his program).\n\nLike Morgan Neville\u2019s hit 2018 documentary, Won\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?, Heller\u2019s film is so besotted with Rogers that it\u2019s enough to turn the stomachs of the handful of misanthropes that don\u2019t view Rogers as a secular saint. Of course, even though I wasn\u2019t ultimately sucked in by Heller\u2019s attempts to avoid sentimentality, and found this well-intentioned movie disconcertingly maudlin, she was certainly determined from the outset to avoid certain narrative pitfalls.\n\nIn fact, Heller and screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster make a valiant effort to prevent A Beautiful Day from resembling a tearjerker for adults. Their main ruse in this regard is a refusal to avoid falling into the traps of the standard biopic. At a Q&A following the screening at Toronto, Heller admitted that most of the public viewed Rogers as either \u201ca saint or a fraud.\u201d The filmmakers\u2019 jab at a nuanced perspective (although many will conclude that Rogers still emerges as impeccably saintly) involves using a cynical journalist named Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) as a foil for Rogers\u2019s child-like innocence.\n\nA fictionalized version of Tom Junod, who wrote an acclaimed profile of Rogers for Esquire in 1998 titled \u201cCan You Say\u2026Hero?,\u201d Lloyd\u2019s skeptical preconceptions concerning Rogers\u2019 persona quickly dissolve when he encounters the PBS TV host in the flesh.\n\nLloyd turns up at his initial interview session with Rogers bearing the visible scars of a brawl with his father, Jerry (Chris Cooper), at a family wedding.\n\nAngry at his dad for having abandoned him and his sister years before, Mister Rogers functions as a surrogate therapist for the troubled Lloyd. Perhaps the most interesting takeaway from the film is that Rogers, although clearly not a Freudian, was in fact an enthusiastic advocate of the \u201ctalking cure.\u201d Unfortunately, instead of the slow, agonizing process of psychoanalysis, Rogers\u2019s injunction to \u201ctalk about\u201d Lloyd\u2019s personal demons is depicted as a near-magical process. After a few interview sessions in which Rogers turns the table on his interlocutor and interviews Lloyd, the crusty journalist is happily reunited with his now-dying father, and his slightly faltering marriage is back on track.\n\nTom Hanks\u2019s carefully-wrought portrayal of Rogers is A Beautiful Day\u2019s saving grace. Without lapsing into caricature, Hanks, assisted only by a wig and redrawn eyebrows, perfectly captures Rogers\u2019s crooked smile, which often threatened to turn into a smirk (but never did) and his slow, sing-songy voice.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to dispute that Fred Rogers was, in many respects, an admirable man. Who can take issue with a benign father figure, who urged parents to empathize with their children\u2019s fears\u2014and vice versa? Rogers\u2019s indisputable goodness notwithstanding, there is something annoyingly safe about paying tribute to a man who was, or so it seems, universally loved. That being said, A Beautiful Day\u2019s premiere left the enraptured TIFF audience teary-eyed. Exiting the theater, the spectators\u2019 faces were aglow as they recounted their favorite Rogers anecdotes. Only those of us with hearts of stone were left unmoved.", "description": "The Oscar-bait drama \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d received a glowing reception from fans of the TV host at its Toronto International Film Festival premiere.", "authors": ["Richard Porton"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567925813/190908-porton-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-hero_p7cgrn", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
