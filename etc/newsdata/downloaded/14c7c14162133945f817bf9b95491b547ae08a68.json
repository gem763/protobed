[O/R]\n\nSaudi Aramco\u2019s longer-dated bonds bore the brunt of the decline. The 2049 issue XS1982116136=TE fell nearly 3 cents in the dollar in early trading to its lowest since early August before recovering some of the losses, data from Tradeweb showed.\n\nSaudi sovereign bonds also came under pressure, with longer-dated issues falling 1 to 2 cents. XS1508675508=TE XS1694218469=TE.\n\n\u201cMarkets had become too sanguine over the last few months about the geopolitical risks facing countries allied with the U.S. against Iran, with Saudi Arabia particularly vulnerable,\u201d said Patrick Wacker at UOB Asset Management.\n\n\u201cWhile Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign fundamentals are still firm, bond prices will need to factor in higher geopolitical risk going forward.\u201d\n\nThe cost of insuring exposure to the government debt rose to a two-week high, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) SAGV5YUSAC=MG jumping by 5 basis points from Friday\u2019s close to 65 bps, according to IHS Markit.\n\nRatings agency Moody\u2019s said the attack was \u201ccredit negative\u201d and the production disruption significant. But it said it did not expect this to have a long-lasting effect on Saudi Aramco\u2019s financial profile, citing the company\u2019s robust balance sheet and strong liquidity buffers.\n\nSaudi Aramco, the world\u2019s largest oil company, made its bond market debut in April with a $12 billion issue. That followed the government\u2019s 2016 debut, when it sold $17.5 billion in a record emerging-market bond sale.\n\nCredit ratings for both Saudi Arabia\u2019s government and Aramco are in the \u201cupper investment grade\u201d bracket, making them popular among institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds who seek high-quality assets.\n\nBlueBay Asset Management portfolio manager Kaspar Hense said he expected more downward pressure on the bond prices over the days to come.\n\n\u201cBut the budget situation in Saudi Arabia and the long-term perspective is not as bad anymore as it was when the oil price went below $40 a barrel, so we think this is a rather short-term selloff,\u201d Hense said.\n\nOn Monday, Saudi stocks .TASI gained 0.3%, with analysts pointing to support from state institutions as well as higher oil prices supporting firms. Yet the gains only partly mitigated a 1% drop on Sunday, with the index down 0.8% since the start of the year.\n\nBlue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) (2010.SE) gained 0.9% after tumbling nearly 3% on Sunday when the company said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe critical issues for Saudi Arabia and the global oil market are the extent of the damage and the time required to restore Aramco\u2019s oil and gas supply,\u201d said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, adding the short-term impact could be partly mitigated by the kingdom drawing down strategic oil reserves.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal deficit could widen by some 0.9-1.0% of GDP under the scenario mentioned above, though oil revenue would see some support from the higher oil price as production and exports gradually normalize.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates Saudi Arabia\u2019s fiscal deficit may widen to 6.5% of gross domestic product from 5.9% in 2018. Higher government expenditure is likely to curb the upside of stronger non-oil economic growth.\n\nInvestors were also trying to gauge what impact the attack could have on Saudi Aramco\u2019s long-awaited initial public offering, which was expected later this year and slated to be the world\u2019s largest.\n\nMalik cautioned that a meaningful withdrawal of strategic reserves to make up for lost output or delay in restoring Saudi oil production could push back the timing of the stock market debut.\n\n\u201cThe attacks could complicate Aramco\u2019s IPO plans given rising security risks and potential impact on its valuation,\u201d Eurasia wrote in a note to clients.", "description": "Dollar-denominated bonds issued by Saudi Arabia's government and state oil company Saudi Aramco tumbled to multi-week lows on Monday after a weekend attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities shut about 5% of global output.
