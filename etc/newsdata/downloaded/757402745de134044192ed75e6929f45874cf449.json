In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.\n\nSterling fell after U.K. politicians failed to deliver the decisive Brexit vote that had been promised at the weekend.\n\nThe decline brought to a halt a four-day winning streak that was fueled by speculation Prime Minister Boris Johnson could win parliamentary backing for his divorce deal. But strategists say the drop may prove short-lived.\n\n\u201cInvestors will have to balance the disappointment of a further delay with the increasing likelihood of eventual passage,\u201d said Ned Rumpeltin, European head of currency strategy at Toronto-Dominion Bank. \u201cThe tail risk of an accidental no-deal crash out has also ratcheted down.\u201d\n\nAnalysts remain bullish even as a verdict on Johnson\u2019s new divorce deal was deferred. Instead, lawmakers supported an amendment put forward by former Conservative minister Oliver Letwin which requires the House of Commons to pass all necessary Brexit legislation before holding a formal vote on the Withdrawal Agreement. That meant the prime minister was legally bound to ask the EU for another extension to negotiations.\n\nThe pound fell as much as 0.8% against the dollar, ending a four-day winning streak. It was down 0.6% at 1.2906 as of 8 a.m. in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cSterling is likely to remain somewhat volatile, but supported, because it appears the chances of a hard (no deal) Brexit are very slim,\u201d said Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.\n\nThe prime minister is set to introduce the legislation needed for an Oct. 31 exit and it\u2019s possible he will garner enough support to push his deal through, according to a Bloomberg analysis. The Times of London reported that the EU may grant a three-month delay if Johnson is unable to secure support for his deal this week.\n\n\u201cSeems like an anti-climactic open for sterling, with investors potentially comforted by the Article 50 extension that the EU seems willing to grant in the case no deal is agreed,\u201d said Valentin Marinov, Credit Agricole\u2019s head of Group-of-10 currency research. \u201cGiven that another vote on the Johnson deal could come as soon as Tuesday, investors could use any sterling dips as buying opportunity.\u201d\n\nMarinov is sticking to his view that the pound could reach $1.36 medium term.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said he would consult EU leaders on how to react to the U.K.\u2019s request for another extension.\n\n\u201cGeneral sentiment is still positive on Brexit, and this extension could be a small bump in the road,\u201d said Sandeep Parekh, an FX strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. \u201cBut I think the next few days will be very important.\u201d\n\nStill, sterling could move sharply lower if Brussels were to formally reject a later deadline, according to TD\u2019s Rumpeltin. It may lurch lower toward $1.2835 and then further to $1.2750 \u201cif the sense from the EU was one of growing rancor and impatience,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Rumpeltin\u2019s central view is one where the EU would grant an extension.\n\nAnd that more bullish slant for the pound is reflected in the views of other strategists too.\n\n\u201cThe weekend\u2019s events, if anything, further reduce the risk of disorderly exit,\u201d said Adam Cole, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s chief currency strategist. A knee-jerk negative sterling reaction may be a buying opportunity, he said.\n\n(Updates with pound extending decline, comment from strategist)\n\n--With assistance from Michael G.
