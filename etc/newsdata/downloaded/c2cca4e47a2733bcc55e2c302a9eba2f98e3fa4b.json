But apparently some of our Democratic candidates for the presidency are really, really opposed to it. Add to that list Mayor Pete Buttigieg. During an interview with The Hill, Buttigieg was asked about this subject and in a follow-up question, the reporter wanted to know if there were any exceptions to his opposition. For example, how about 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? Would Buttigieg be willing to see a needle stuck in the terrorist\u2019s arm? Nope. Not even for the infamous KSM.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg is so opposed to the death penalty he would not support executing 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The Hill asked Buttigieg about executing Mohammed, who is currently detained at Guantanamo Bay pending a death penalty trial scheduled to begin January 2021. Buttigieg responded that even this case did not merit execution. \u201cIf you mean it, you mean it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who may deserve to die. I just don\u2019t know anybody who deserves to kill them.\u201d This is not the first time Buttigieg has opposed the death penalty.\n\nThe Mayor believes that capital punishment is a \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d practice and has gone so far as calling for a constitutional amendment to ban the practice.\n\nIf that\u2019s his position as a Christian I can respect his stance, providing he\u2019s consistent about it. On that point, it\u2019s worth noting that Buttigieg supports a woman\u2019s ability to have an abortion all the way through the third trimester and right up until the baby\u2019s delivery due date. So perhaps his opposition to the intentional termination of any human life is a bit conditional.\n\nStill, as I said, I can understand the moral position of those who believe that nobody should take another human life. We can debate whether the Sixth Commandment actually meant thou shalt not kill or thou shalt not murder (a key distinction) until the cows come home, but it\u2019s still a defensible position.\n\nI\u2019ve also heard less convincing arguments from people who claim that the death penalty is pointless because it doesn\u2019t act as a deterrent. I happen to disagree, partly because it\u2019s definitely a deterrent for the person heading to the gallows. The recidivism rate among criminals who are put to death remains at precisely zero. But beyond that, even if there is no way to measure it, I continue to believe that there are some felons out there who decided not to pull the trigger at the last minute because they didn\u2019t want to end up on death row.\n\nBut if you\u2019re someone who leaves any amount of wiggle room in that discussion, you probably allow for some exceptions. Can you kill in self-defense? How about soldiers fighting in defense of their country? Can they kill the enemy? And if we\u2019re going to make any exceptions at all for state-sanctioned executions, surely terrorists who engineer brazen attacks that take the lives of thousands should make the list, shouldn\u2019t they?\n\nI don\u2019t expect Buttigieg to either gain or lose any ground on this question. And given the fact that he remains stuck in single digits in most polls and his support among black voters in his party is effectively zero, it probably won\u2019t matter all that much anyway. But now that the subject has been broached yet again, the frontrunners will likely need to be weighing in on it. Are we really taking the death penalty off the table even for terrorists?\n\nSomething tells me that this isn\u2019t as popular of an opinion among the voters as Mayor Pete might think. The fact is, there are some people who just need killing. And KSM should be near the top of that list.", "description": "Nobody except abortion doctors has the right to take a life", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Khalid-Sheik-Mohammed.jpg"}
