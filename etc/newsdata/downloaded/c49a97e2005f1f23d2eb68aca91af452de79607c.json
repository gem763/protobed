Brodeur\u2019s mother, Malabar, a food columnist for the Boston Globe, planned to develop a cookbook with her husband, Charles, and their best friends, Ben and Lily Souther. Ben was a hunter, Malabar was a cook. Charles and Lily would be involved primarily as tasters \u2014 but more importantly, as pathetic dupes, since the entire purpose of the project was to give Malabar and Ben the opportunity to carry on their recently begun affair in plain sight.\n\n\u201c \u2018Do we have a title?\u2019 asked Charles.\n\n\u2018How about something simple?\u2019 Malabar said. \u2018We could call it Wild Game. It tells the reader what to expect but promises adventure, too.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s perfect,\u2019 Lily said.\n\nBen touched his glass to my mother\u2019s. \u2018To our wild game, Malabar.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe double entendre was perfectly obvious even at the time, at least to the three who were in on the conspiracy: Malabar, Ben, and 14-year-old Adrienne, known as Rennie, who was roped into their illicit liaison minutes after the first adulterous kiss.\n\nBrodeur\u2019s book about her mother\u2019s very long con and her own miserable role in it manages to be both elegant and trashy at the same time, elevating 40-year-old gossip to an art form. To situate her on the \u201cMommie Dearest\u201d scale, Brodeur combines the you\u2019re-not-gonna-believe-this outrage of a Sean Wilsey (\u201cOh the Glory of It All\u201d) with the high-test filial devotion of a Mary Karr (\u201cThe Liars\u2019 Club.\u201d)\n\n\n\n(Houghton Mifflin Harcourt)\n\nAuthor Adrienne Brodeur. (Julia Cumes)\n\nThree months before that fateful dinner, in July 1980, a similar gathering, with an identical guest list and a similar agenda of food and drink took place. After a couple of tumblers of bourbon, the two couples progressed to the \u201cpower pack\u201d \u2014 a dry Manhattan with a twist. (Just the way watching the movie \u201cLeaving Las Vegas\u201d may drive you to a bar, I find I have been desperate for a \u201cpower pack\u201d ever since I read this book.)\n\n[The trouble with the bad mother memoir]\n\nThen on to the kitchen where Malabar made theater of the preparation of the sack of headless squabs Ben had brought. Behind her, a panoramic view of Nauset Harbor on Cape Cod; before her, a rectangle of butter \u201csoftened into a glistening mound.\u201d\n\nWith every detail, Brodeur conveys that sex was in the air that night. Young Rennie herself was waiting impatiently for a chance to slip out and meet the neighbor boy with whom she\u2019d been having nightly make-out sessions. They only get to first base, but back in bed she can\u2019s stop thinking about it.\n\nNext thing she knows her mother is bent over her, begging her to wake up. \u201cBen Souther just kissed me,\u201d she breathlessly confides. Malabar has to say it several times before her daughter can take it in. Rennie has known the Southers since she was 8, which is when her mother married Charles. Charles and Ben have been best friends for 50 years; they have \u201chunted and fished together, dated each other\u2019s sisters, been ushers at each other\u2019s weddings, and become godfather to each other\u2019s sons.\u201d\n\nShouldn\u2019t Malabar have slapped Ben? Rennie wondered at the time. Apparently not. \u201cJoy had fallen from the night sky and landed in my mother\u2019s voice.\u201d Malabar goes on to explain that she will need her daughter\u2019s help in figuring out how to conduct the affair in secret. She must not tell anyone, not her brother, not her father, not her friends. \u201cPromise me that, Rennie. You must take the secret to your grave.\u201d\n\nBrodeur, a former book and magazine editor, pinpoints this luscious, passionate, awful evening as the beginning of the rest of her life. She is not exaggerating. Her emotional and practical involvement in her mother\u2019s affair became the controlling factor of her existence, warping every relationship and decision up to and including her first marriage, a nearly gothic plot development that deserves not to be spoiled. The publication of this memoir, occurring after many players are dead and Malabar in her 80s, suffering from dementia, is not even the true ending of the wild game, but only a way station in its long denouement.\n\nThe shocking cruelty of involving her daughter in this scheme, driving a wedge between her and everyone else in her life, was never clear to Malabar. \u201cRemember, we are two halves of one whole,\u201d she told daughter, calling her back from Hawaii where Brodeur had impulsively fled to take a gap year before college.\n\n[A daughter\u2019s loving but unsettling portrait of Leonard Bernstein]\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ever do that again,\u201d her mother begs her on her return. \u201cI felt like I was missing a limb without you.\u201d At this point, Brodeur is accompanied by a boyfriend, a pot dealer she met in the gift shop where she worked \u2014 the first person with whom she ever shared her secret. When he reacted with horror at her mother\u2019s conduct, Brodeur became so furious they decided to pretend they had never had the conversation. This misdirected anger never takes aim at its rightful target; in the very last sentence of the book, the author offers thanks to \u201cMalabar Brewster, my first and most abiding love.\u201d\n\nBy the time Brodeur returns from Hawaii at 18, \u201cfour years since Ben first kissed my mother, fifteen hundred days, thirty-five thousand hours. Twelve million minutes,\u201d many millions of minutes more await the enraptured reader. Self-dramatizing tendencies may have been a problem for Malabar, but they work beautifully in Brodeur\u2019s memoir, making a glittering, insightful page-turner of the worst-case scenario of mother-daughter boundary issues.\n\nMarion Winik, a professor at the University of Baltimore, is the author of numerous books, including \u201cFirst Comes Love,\u201d \u201cThe Lunch-Box Chronicles\u201d and, most recently, \u201cThe Big Book of the Dead.\u201d At 7 p.m. on Oct. 16, Adrienne Brodeur will be at Politics and Prose, 5015 Connecticut Ave. NW Washington, D.C.", "description": "Adrienne Brodeur\u2019s memoir is a riveting account of what it was like to be her mother\u2019s secret-keeper.", "authors": ["Marion Winik", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XXg1PuCLUJLjRUSWHBa1uh4fHAI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PO7AWPG73MI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
