Yet following centuries of tradition Nicholoas Hack, named after its founder, has emerged as the first company to manufacturer watches in Australia.\n\nWhile the company\u2019s history is short compared with many of the more famous watch brands, its story is already a compelling one so far. Last year the brand released the first series of 25 timepieces in which the \u201cvery DNA of the watch\u201d, such as the main plate and bridges, were Australian made.\n\n\u201cModern digital technology is not a replacement for sophistication, and by sophistication we mean the appreciation for craftsmen\u2019s ability to turn a piece of metal into high-precision yet artistic instruments,\u201d says Hacko, explaining why traditional watches have continued to be so popular in an era of smartphones and watches.\n\n\u201cA mechanical watch is a miracle of mechanical engineering. It comes with high expectations of time accurately 24/7 without any rest while being in constant motion exposed to outside forces, temperature changes and with almost no servicing.\n\n\u201cWhile we are quite happy to replace our mobile phone every two to three years, we expect a mechanical watch to last for 50 or 100 years. I cannot think of any piece of machinery \u2013 digital or mechanical \u2013 that will have to meet such requirements.\u201d\n\nHacko says the ultimate challenge for a watchmaker is to manufacture components at very tight tolerances, often at micron level. Manufacturing a titanium watch main plate, for example, requires 24 different tools and three types of jig to hold it in place.\n\nThe luxury of precision time by Nicholas Hacko. Supplied.\n\nThe machining time and hand-finishing process takes nearly a full working day \u2013 and the consequence of just one mistake from a single tool is restarting the entire process from scratch. It\u2019s a labour of love to bring the right time to a watch wearer\u2019s every day.\n\nThe value of luxury\n\nSwedish car maker Volvo \u2013 as part of its sustainability initiative, the \u2018omtanke\u2019 philosophy which focuses on ways in which to view the world differently \u2013 is aiming by 2025 to give back a week of quality time every year to owners of its cars through autonomous drive technology.\n\nTisha Johnson, the company\u2019s head of interior design, views advances in technology as the underpinnings of big cultural trends today.\n\n\u201cPeople are expecting products to give back to them as never before,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cWellbeing, safety and security, and time are three examples of very big focus areas for people around the world.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we created our vertical centre touchscreen to improve interaction within the car. We\u2019ve also presented the 360c concept, which leverages cutting-edge tech in order to give back time and peace of mind.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done it in a way that again isn\u2019t focused on the technology itself but rather what value we can bring back to people every day.\n\n\u201cGood technology will continue to help customers experience Volvo\u2019s rich Scandinavian design.\u201d\n\nScandinavian design is renowned for its minimalist approach and the way it strives to balance form and function.\n\nAnd as the only Scandinavian car maker in the world, it gives Volvo a distinctive look compared with rivals from Germany, England and Japan.\n\nA seat at the table of luxury\n\nWood is synonymous with Scandinavian furniture, though the use of it in the creative process isn\u2019t exclusive to the likes of Sweden and Denmark, of course.\n\nAustralian furniture designer Mark Tuckey has been specialising in the age-old material of timber since the very early 1990s. Recycled timber furniture met his desires to work with something that was environmentally friendly and also allowed him to do something creative.\n\n\u201cI love timber,\u201d says Mark passionately. \u201cThe look, the smell, the feel, the inherent usefulness and adaptability of it; it\u2019s an incredible, naturally occurring part of nature.\n\nMark Tuckey uses natural materials to create luxury furniture. Supplied.\n\n\u201cMostly, old timbers have an inherent structural integrity that new timbers don\u2019t as new timbers are fast-grown with hormones and cut down whilst young so never get the same density.\u201d\n\nAsked why wood evokes such a sense of luxury in furniture, as well as other design pieces, Tuckey offers a passionate explanation.\n\n\u201cWood is real. It\u2019s natural. It smells, looks and feels like luxury. It's authentic, nature has gifted us an amazing resource. Wood stands up on its own without needing much processing; its calm. That\u2019s luxury to me.\u201d\n\nOmtanke isn\u2019t just a word. It\u2019s a lens through which you can view the world, and see things differently. It\u2019s a new perspective. A considerate, more caring one. Omtanke shines a brighter light on the things that really matter, and that helps us focus on making those things better. On making the world better. For everyone.
