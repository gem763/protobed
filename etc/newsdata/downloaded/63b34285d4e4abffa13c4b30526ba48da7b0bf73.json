Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in an \u201cImpeachment Town Hall\u201d on the season premiere of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 and it was hard to believe he wasn\u2019t the real senator.\n\nDavid looked like Sanders, even sounded like him \u2014 just funnier.\n\n\u201cHello everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m so excited to be back and to ruin things a second time!\u201d\n\nHe skewered a slow-talking Joe Biden (played by host Woody Harrelson), noting: \u201cRemember when everyone thought I was going to be the one who seemed out of touch? This guy makes me look like Drake.\u201d\n\nHe wound up his pitch offering: \u201cFree college, free healthcare, free refills on any medium-sized soft drink.\u201d He added: \u201cLast time my slogan was \u2018feel the Bern.\u2019 This time it\u2019s \u2018Let\u2019s burn this place to the ground.\u2019\u201d\n\nHarrelson\u2019s Biden soothed: \u201cDaddy\u2019s here, America. I see you, I hear you, I sniff you, and I hug you from behind.\u201d\n\nKate McKinnon resurrected her Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) impression. \u201cI hope you guys all enjoyed hot-girl summer, because it\u2019s school-librarian fall,\u201d she said. \u201cI have the energy of a mother of five boys who all play a different sport.\u201d\n\nMaya Rudolph, a former \u201cSNL\u201d cast member, as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) described herself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s cool aunt, a fun aunt, I call that a \u2018Funt\u2019 ... the kind of Funt that will give you weed but then arrest you for having weed.\u201d\n\nNew cast member Chloe Fineman did a spacey turn as candidate Marianne Williamson who discussed her strategy for impeachment. \u201cHere\u2019s how I will impeach Donald Trump: I will trap his soul inside this crystal,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo this election, vote for magic.\u201d\n\nAlex Moffat played former Democratic Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke; new cast member Bowen Yang was Andrew Yang; Chris Redd played Cory Booker; and \u201cWeekend Update\u201d host Colin Jost made a rare sketch appearance as Pete Buttigieg.\n\nCheck them all out in the video above.\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nLove HuffPost?
