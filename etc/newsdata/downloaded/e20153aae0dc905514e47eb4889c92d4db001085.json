A hurricane watch also was issued from the Volusia-Brevard County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line.\n\nThe storm was about 175 miles east of Palm Beach and moving to the west at 5 mph on Sunday evening.\n\nIn a news conference on Sunday, after the Hurricane warning had been issued, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said, \u201cWe are continuing to make all necessary precautions in urging people out in the state of Florida to make their preparations, heed evacuation orders. This storm has tracked further west, slightly, but still further west than we had hoped.\u201d\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S PATH: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nDeSantis said Dorian was expected to approach closer to the Florida coast.\n\n\u201cThe storm has slowed down but we do need it to slow down just a little bit more to ensure when it turns north that it\u2019s not impacting directly the Florida coast. And, we cannot say that that is not a possibility, and so I think it\u2019s important that we prepare for this to potentially make landfall here,\u201d DeSantis said.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, Naval Station Mayport, in Jacksonville, announced it would be evacuated by Monday morning.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s evacuation order, which covered about 830,000 people, is set to go into effect at noon on Monday. That's when state troopers are expected to start reversing lanes so people could head inland on major coastal highways.\n\nThe governor also ordered the mandatory medical evacuation for health care facilities licensed by the state's Department of Health and Environmental Control. Beginning Tuesday, all schools and government offices in Jasper, Beaufort, Colleton, Charleston, Dorchester, Berkeley, Georgetown, and Horry counties will be forced to stay closed, officials said.\n\nThe order will mark the fourth time in four years that hundreds of thousands will be forced to evacuate.\n\nMcMaster said he realized some people won\u2019t be happy having to evacuate, but added, \u201cwe believe we can keep everyone alive.\u201d\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN, CATEGORY 5 STORM, MAKES LANDFALL IN BAHAMS WITH 185 MPH WINDS\n\nGeorgia Governor Brian Kemp tweeted on Sunday night, \u201cStarting noon tomorrow, individuals east of I-95 in Bryan, Camden, Chatham, Glynn, Liberty, and McIntosh Counties must evacuate due to Hurricane #Dorian.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged residents to \u201cstay vigilant and be safe.\u201d\n\nKemp also declared a state of emergency for Brantley, Bryan, Camden, Charlton, Chatham, Effingham, Glynn, Liberty, Long, McIntosh, Pierce and Wayne counties.\n\nIn an effort to make sure there enough petroleum products, emergency supplies, and food, Kemp also issued an executive order temporarily suspending federal rules and regulations which otherwise would limit the hours that operators of commercial vehicles could drive.\n\nThe Category 5 hurricane battered parts of the Bahamas Sunday with its 185 mph winds, making it the second-strongest storm in the Atlantic Ocean since 1950.\n\nHomes missing parts of their roofs, cars overturned and downed power lines have been reported on the Abaco Islands. One video showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of one town.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBahamas Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said, \u201cyou cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins\u201d on parts of Abaco. No deaths initially were reported.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has predicted the center of Dorian will stay off shore near the South Carolina coast starting Wednesday afternoon. However, a small error in the forecast could send the eye and strongest winds into the state.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Hurricane Warning has been issued for parts of Florida and a mandatory evacuation of South Carolina\u2019s entire coast has been ordered Sunday as powerful Hurricane Dorian threatens the United States.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
