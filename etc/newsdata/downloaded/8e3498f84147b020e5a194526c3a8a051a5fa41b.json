He was really funny.\n\n\u201cOne of my favourite memories of him was when we used to go to The Pit and he sat in what you would put plant pots in and he got stuck.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t ring the fire brigade because we were laughing that much so he had to call them to get him out.\n\n\u201cAt the time he was mad at us but in the end he found it funny.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cJust talk. Talk to someone you feel comfortable with. He would keep it to himself. I think it is fair to say out of all of his siblings I was the closest to him and he would never tell me about it.\n\n(Image: Google Maps)\n\n\u201cHe was more bothered about what was going on in my life and was more bothered about others than himself.\"\n\nAs he pieced his life back together, he secured his dream job working with Hull City Council as a Youth Champion, helping young people in care and guiding them on to better paths.\n\nHis mum said: \u201cHe was dead proud of where he was working. He showed me his new suit and said \u2018what do you think mum?\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was starting to get somewhere job wise. It was a job he was chuffed to bits with. I was immensely proud.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
