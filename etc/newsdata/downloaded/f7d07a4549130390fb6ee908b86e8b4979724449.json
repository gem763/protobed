Edneyville Fire and Rescue Chief Robert Griffin tells Yahoo Lifestyle it appears the fire started due to a space heater, and that the family was not home when it broke out. When the family returned home, 6-year-old Damon was very worried about whether or not his Halloween costume had been inside.\n\nCaptain Tim Griffin of the Henderson County Sheriff\u2019s Office was the first on the scene, and spoke with the family\u2019s grandmother (who didn\u2019t live in the RV) while they waited for the fire trucks to arrive. That\u2019s when Damon got involved in the conversation. \u201cThe little boy made mention that he sure hoped his Batman costume wasn\u2019t in there,\u201d Captain Griffin (no relation to Chief Griffin) tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cHis grandmother looked at me over his head and made the nod that it was in there.\u201d\n\nDamon\u2019s mom, Cayce Burroughs, tells Yahoo Lifestyle everything in the RV was lost, adding that she and her fianc\u00e9 had been planning to start a handyman service but the tools they were going to use for that company burned up in the RV. Burroughs also posted a Facebook update which laid out all that\u2019s happened to the family.\n\nShe writes, \u201cWe had to leave our home of 5-plus years because of problem neighbors. Not having anywhere to go we have been staying in a RV beside Mom's which was not big enough for all of us so Austin, Blake and Cole have been staying with their dad during the week and with us on the weekends so I am missing them all the time ...\n\n\u201cThis morning while taking Damon to school the RV caught on fire and was gone with everything in it. So where do we go from here?\u201d\n\nCaptain Griffin was very affected by the whole situation. \u201cThey were living in an RV to begin with and it didn\u2019t look like they had a whole lot and then the camper was a total loss. They lost everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so much bad in my career and I love kids, and it just struck me that this little boy, all he was worrying about was having his Batman costume burn up.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Captain Griffin decided to go find another batman costume for Damon. \u201cI didn\u2019t care where I had to go,\u201d he says. \u201cI was going to get this young\u2019un a Batman costume.\u201d\n\nChief Griffin said he was there when Captain Griffin returned with the costume for Damon. \u201cHe was ecstatic,\u201d Chief Griffin says of Damon\u2019s reaction. \u201cFirst thing he had to do was go put it on.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was obviously really excited, and so was I,\u201d Captain Griffin says. \u201cI said we need all the little Batmans we can get, to help us do our sheriff\u2019s duties. So I told him you get that thing on because we need your help out here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Griffin, who has been a law enforcement officer since 1984, said this particular situation really impacted him. \u201cIt\u2019s just real tragic,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen countless bad things but this one really bothered me.\u201d He added that he knew it had bothered Chief Griffin too, as the other man decided to set up a GoFundMe for the family \u2014 the first time he\u2019s ever done that. \u201cThis is a family that did not have much to begin and they seemed to be kind of proud,\u201d Griffin says of why he set up the page. Speaking of Cayce Burroughs he says, \u201cYou could tell she was hesitant and didn't want to ask for help, but it was a situation [in which] I felt they could really use it.\u201d\n\nIn addition to funds, the GoFundMe page is also requesting clothing, shoes and diapers. \u201cThey did not have any insurance and have lost all personal belongings,\u201d Chief Griffin wrote on the page. \u201cThey have immediate needs, things such as clothes, diapers and hygiene products.\u201d\n\nCaptain Griffin said the Red Cross had helped the family out with housing for the first few days after the fire, but Burroughs noted that things were very up in the air, saying that she didn\u2019t know where her family would sleep tonight, at least \u201cnot at this moment.\u201d\n\nOne thing she was certain of is that Damon will be wearing his Batman costume to go trick or treating. \u201cOf course,\u201d she says when asked if he\u2019d be wearing his Batman costume on Halloween. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely excited.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A police captain saved the day for a 6-year-old boy who lost his Halloween costume in a fire.", "authors": ["Elena Sheppard", "Wellness Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6LHnAnwFkVn7hSB9Labtww--~B/aD05NjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a03592b0-ede5-11e9-bdeb-8a137657fd31", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
