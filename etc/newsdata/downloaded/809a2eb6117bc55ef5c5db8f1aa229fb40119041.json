And as we expected from the hints dropped by Sony over the past week, we have a new The Last of Us Part II trailer and, notably, a release date.\n\nHere are the biggest announcements and trailers from today\u2019s State of Play:\n\nThe big news is obviously that the next installment in Naughty Dog\u2019s The Last of Us series is coming in February 2020. That\u2019s a little longer away than I had hoped, but based on the trailer shared, I think I\u2019ll spend the time between now and then emotionally preparing for what seems like a depressing, but probably compelling, game.\n\nDeath Stranding launches on November 8th, and Sony announced that a limited edition PS4 Pro bundle will release on the same day. The console itself is white, and is covered in black handprints. The most eye-catching part of the bundle is the controller, which is modeled after a BB pod \u2014 sans BB inside, of course. Sony has more details right here.\n\nHumanity, the latest game from Tetsuya Mizuguchi\n\nSony announced Humanity, a hard-to-describe game coming from Enhance, the studio led by Tetsuya Mizuguchi. The meditative gameplay from his previous works, like Rez and Tetris Effect, seems to have made its way into this new title. But as for what\u2019s actually happening, it looks like a mix between Lemmings and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, but with some elegant visuals and interesting sound design. I could be totally wrong, though, and I sort of hope that I am. It will also have an optional PlayStation VR mode.\n\nYou can download a demo for the MediEvil remake\n\nSony released a new trailer for the remake of MediEvil, the PS1 hack-and-slack game. If you\u2019ve been waiting to get your hands on it, you can download a free demo right now on the PlayStation Store.\n\nA deeper look at Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019s campaign\n\nInfinity Ward and Activision have been mum about what players will get into in the upcoming campaign of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Today\u2019s new trailer clears things up a bit.\n\nWattam is coming in December 2019\n\nThe latest game from Katamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi is called Wattam, and based on the footage that Sony showed off, it looks like a colorful, jovial experience like his previous work. It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly what you\u2019ll be doing in the game, but it looks relaxing.\n\nCivilization VI released on PC back in 2016, then the Nintendo Switch last year, but it will be hitting the PS4 (and Xbox One) on November 22nd. Sony released a trailer for the game that you can check out above.", "description": "Today, Sony announced that The Last of Us: Part II will release on February 21st, 2020. It also released a new trailer for the game. The State of Play conference also divulged new trailers and details for Wattam, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, and other titles.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kKXIw48epwmt51TGyaB5znAMqA4=/0x99:1374x818/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19229551/ps4deathstrandingbundle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
