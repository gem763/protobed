It showed Trump urging Ukraine to \u201clook into\u201d his Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe publication of the call, in which the presidents made critical comments about German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, has hurt Ukraine\u2019s efforts to forge closer ties with the European Union and drawn acerbic comments from other Russian officials and lawmakers.\n\nSpeaking Sunday on state television, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the release of Trump-Zelenskiy call by the White House should put other heads of states on guard in conversations with the American president.\n\n\u201cEveryone understands after this scandal that it\u2019s dangerous to make calls and conduct talks with Washington,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 push for the publications of Trump-Putin calls comes amid a bitter strain over Russia\u2019s meddling into the U.S. 2016 presidential election, which the Kremlin has squarely denied and Trump has sought to play down.\n\nPutin and his lieutenants derided U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Kremlin interference in the 2016 presidential election, casting it as a failure and shrugging off Mueller\u2019s exposure of evidence of Russian meddling in the vote.\n\nMueller found that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia, but he charged 12 Russian military intelligence officers with breaking into Democratic Party computers and the email accounts of officials with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Kremlin said Monday that transcripts of calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin can only be published by mutual agreement.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Vladimir Isachenkov"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/06/28/trump_g20_us_russia_45626_c0-0-3886-2265_s1770x1032.jpg?71d19ea1505a66e61cb3f0b3ca6f64fc4343e565", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
