But it turns out I didn't have to, because my wife surprised me by buying me one for my birthday.\n\nWithout a doubt, it was the best present I'd ever gotten, and also the one that most necessitated me updating my will. Because you see, while inside I felt like a kid again, outside I remained very much a middle-aged man with a sense of balance that could only be described as intermittent.\n\nI didn't let that stop me, though, and despite more than a few falls I felt like it was coming back to me.\n\nHeck, I even skateboarded past a bunch of teenagers one time and I swear I heard one of them say, \"That guy is cool!\"\n\nContributor Luke Burbank recently took up a new hobby, skateboarding, and while inside he felt like a kid again, outside he remained very much a middle-aged man with intermittent balance. CBS News\n\nI was on top of the world!\n\nAnd then, I saw the meme \u2013 you know, one of those funny pictures that lives online.\n\nIt's called, \"How do you do, fellow kids?\" and it shows actor Steve Buscemi trying to seem youthful, carrying a skateboard.\n\nA reminder of life's inexorable progression. CBS News\n\nIn an instant, I realized that was me \u2013 a silly-looking 42-year-old with a mortgage and high cholesterol who thought he could reconnect with his youth.\n\nI knew it was time to hang up my board. The dream was over.\n\nAnd then something interesting happened. At a radio show taping I was part of, I met the actual Tony Hawk, skateboard legend, who, it turns out, is eight years older than me \u2013 and still skateboarding every day.\n\nLuke Burbank. CBS News\n\nI told him about my doubts, and he confided in me that he still gets nervous before jumping his board 30 feet in the air and completely rotating it two-and-a-half times. I told him I knew how he felt, because sometimes I just fall off the board for no reason.\n\nFor a brief moment he wasn't Tony Hawk and I wasn't Luke Burbank. We were just two dudes, talking about skateboarding.\n\nWill I ever be as good as him? Probably not! But am I giving up? Not a chance.\n\nI've just got one question I need answered: How do you do, fellow kids?\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Young Kim.\n\n\n\nSee also:", "description": "Contributor Luke Burbank recently took up a new hobby, and while inside he felt like a kid again, outside he remained very much a middle-aged man with intermittent balance", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/19/894bf7d3-37e9-40d4-b6a6-3a22bd2da53c/thumbnail/1200x630/822a66536a729c420ee12beddc29fb6a/luek-burbank-skateboarding-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
