She is actually one of the UK\u2019s youngest terminal breast cancer patients, and got married as part of her \u2018bucket list\u2019 to now-husband Simon.\n\nAlthough Vicki has not been given a precise life expectancy, she was told seven months ago when she was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer that there was nothing more doctors could do to help her.\n\nVicki is one of only 31 people under 24 to be diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the UK \u2013 accounting for just 0.056% of the 55,000 annual cases across all age groups, according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nThe HR auditor first found a lump in her left breast as she showered in November 2016, and has since gone through a double mastectomy, six rounds of chemotherapy and hormone repression treatment. Despite all of this, at a routine check up on 20 February this year, doctors found another lump where the cancer had been before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018It grew between the skin and the silicon and saline implant, so I could feel it below the nipple.\u2019\n\nThat turn of events might have broken a lot of people, but for Vicki it sparked the decision to make a whole load of memories.\n\nAnd what better way to do that with her partner Simon, who she\u2019s now been in a relationship with three years.\n\nVicki and Simon (Collect/PA Real Life)\n\nThe couple got together after meeting in the unlikely setting of Vicki\u2019s nail technician mum, Helen\u2019s, 50th H-themed fancy dress birthday party in July 2016 at Hertfordshire\u2019s Chipperfield Cricket Club.\n\nSimon was having some drinks after playing cricket with pals and Vicki \u2013 dressed as a Hell\u2019s Angel \u2013 got talking to him after her mum, in a Helen of Troy costume, played matchmaker.\n\nAfter that they bonded and started their relationship. But it wasn\u2019t long before Vicki \u2013 just 21 at the time \u2013 first felt the lump, and found out she had breast cancer.\n\n\u2018When I felt mine, I found a lump. I showed Simon and he told me to talk to my mum, which I did,\u2019 said Vicki.\n\nThings moved swiftly, from Vicki\u2019s diagnosis to her surgery, and a sadly unsuccessful attempt to harvest her eggs, with her hoping she could have IVF in the future and finally chemotherapy, which ended in June 2017.\n\nKeen for their love story to continue, and to celebrate the end of the treatment, Vicki and Simon headed off travelling around South East Asia for six months, and later settled back into their happy life back home.\n\nVicki and Simon on her first day of chemo in 2016 (Collect/PA Real Life)\n\nSimon proposed on 19 March this year, with Vicki saying, \u2018I\u2019m a massive Anne Boleyn fan and he proposed in the chapel of the Tower of London where her body was buried.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the day later that the pair, from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, were dealt the terrible blow that Vicki\u2019s cancer had returned and was terminal.\n\n\u2018I was convinced they had the wrong scan results. I didn\u2019t feel any different,\u2019 said Vicki.\n\n\u2018In my head, when cancer has spread everywhere, you should be in pain, but I didn\u2019t feel any \u2013 it didn\u2019t feel real.\u2019\n\nA lumpectomy at St Albans City Hospital was the next step, to remove the tumour in her left breast, before starting an ongoing course of oral chemotherapy medication, that she takes daily every three weeks \u2013 with a week off in between \u2013 to stop the cancer from spreading any further.\n\nAn eternal optimist, rather than crumbling under the strain of her diagnosis, Vicki started making plans.\n\nShe said: \u2018I didn\u2019t go off the rails after my diagnosis, instead I used it as a motivator to do everything that I wanted to do \u2013 as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve even discussed having children with Simon. I know I can\u2019t have my own biological children, but we will look at fostering or adoption down the line, but I think we need a couple of years to see how the treatment pans out first.\n\n\u2018I also started making a short-term bucket list of things I knew I wanted to do within the year. At the top of it all was getting married, as well as owning my own horse, as I loved dressage, had won prizes and had been riding since I was eight.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVicki was able to get her horse thanks to \u00a314,000 of donations from friends and family, and the wedding planning followed.\n\nVicki showcasing her wedding dress (Collect/PA Real Life)\n\nVicki said: \u2018It didn\u2019t seem fair on Simon, not knowing how long we would have left together. But he wasn\u2019t having any of it. He made it clear he\u2019d stuck with me through the 2016 diagnosis and wasn\u2019t planning on running away now.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s when he suggested pulling the wedding forward. In that moment I knew he was right. How could I say no to someone who loved me that much?\u2019\n\nVicki\u2019s dream venue \u2013 the magnificent Leeds Castle, near Maidstone, Kent \u2013 was unavailable under such short notice.\n\nBut when a family friend suggested tying the knot at Leez Priory in Chelmsford, she was lost for words.\n\n\u2018Obviously I loved it. It was a monastery until Henry VIII had it dissolved, back when Anne Boleyn was on the scene,\u2019 she said.\n\nThe only day they had available was a Friday 13th, but Vicki pushed on, saying: \u2018I haven\u2019t had much good luck in this life and I just thought to myself, \u2018What\u2019s one day going to do?\u201d\n\nRecalling the day she chose her wedding dress, Vicki, said she was \u2018giddy with excitement.\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018After being diagnosed with stage four cancer, I thought this might never be a possibility, so trying on dresses with my mum was such a special moment to share.\u2019\n\nThe couple managed to bag a venue that tied in with Vicki\u2019s love of Anne Boleyn (Collect/PA Real Life)\n\nAnd in her stunning strapless gown, as she exchanged rings with her handsome husband on September 13 in front of 75 guests, flanked by five bridesmaids \u2013 her younger cousin and four very close friends \u2013 dressed in sky blue chiffon frocks, she looked incredible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVicki, who took a month off from her cancer drugs, so she would feel great on her wedding day, said: \u2018It was the most beautiful setting I could have hoped for. I could see the tower against the clear blue sky as I got ready in the morning \u2013 it was perfect.\u2019\n\nRegarding their vows, Vicki confessed: \u2018We stuck with traditional vows and when it came to \u2019til death do us part,\u2019 it was hard not to think about the future. But I was very, very happy on my wedding day, so I didn\u2019t let the negativity come to the surface \u2013 I pushed it away.\n\n\u2018No one wants to walk down the aisle with a death sentence hanging over them, but that\u2019s the thing about Simon, he makes me forget all of that. We\u2019re completely on the same page and refuse to focus on the terrible things that could happen, instead we focus on the brilliant things that could instead.\u2019\n\nThe new Mrs Eastaugh \u2013 formerly Vicki Turner \u2013 had the first dance later to Pete Doherty\u2019s For Lovers.\n\n\u2018Lyrically, the song spoke to both of us,\u2019 she explained. \u2018There\u2019s one particular line \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m running away with you just for today\u2019- which really rang true.\u2019\n\nNow determined to enjoy married life for a while before the next bucket list celebration, Vicki and Simon have delayed taking a honeymoon until next April, when they will jet to a luxury all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic for two weeks.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to visit the Caribbean, but I just wanted to enjoy a bit of married life first,\u2019 she says.\n\nWhat a stunning couple, who clearly mean the world to each other. We wish them all the best.\n\nMORE: Mum creates genius meal planning board using lollipop sticks to make dinner decisions easier\n\nMORE: Why do people punish themselves for masturbating?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Vicki Eastaugh married her long-term partner in a poignant ceremony, after being diagnosed with terminal breast cancer at just 24.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91406817_1571841453.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
