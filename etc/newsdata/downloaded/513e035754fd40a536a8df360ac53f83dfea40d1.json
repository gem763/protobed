Companies with inferior credit ratings and higher probabilities of defaulting on their bonds have to pay loftier interest rates. The third risk driver is liquidity. Bonds that are difficult to buy and sell after they have been issued typically carry a risk premium. A final variable to consider is the currency. Most of the bonds in global high-yield portfolios are not issued in Aussie dollars. Simply hedging global high yield into our currency has historically improved returns by 1.5 per cent annually since 2007 compared to holding the bonds in US dollars.\n\nUnfortunately, this hedging benefit has swung 180 degrees, and now reduces, rather than boosts, returns by roughly 1 per cent each year. This makes historical analysis complicated, because you need to understand that past returns are artificially inflated via a hedging benefit that has disappeared.\n\nSo are some high-yield bonds just equities in disguise? We can address this question by comparing the Bloomberg Barclays Global High Yield Total Return Index, which is a flagship measure for the sector, with Aussie shares (plus dividends). My table shows high-yield bond returns with fixed-rate duration risk embedded in them, and in \u201cfloating-rate\u201d format with the duration hazards hedged out.\n\nLet\u2019s start by focusing on the floating-rate US dollar exposure, because it abstracts away from both the currency hedging and duration impacts. In US dollars, global high yield has delivered exactly the same 5.8 per cent annual return as Aussie shares since January 2007, which captures the impact of the GFC.\n\nIf you adjusted for franking credits, Aussie shares would outperform on a post-tax basis. The 11 per cent annual return volatility of global high yield is also surprisingly similar to the 13.5 per cent volatility of Aussie shares. If you add in the historic Aussie dollar currency hedging benefit, high yield outperforms before franking considerations (although hedging is now a 1 per cent annual cost). Throw in interest-rate duration risk and you get another 1.5 per cent annually as long-term yields have fallen.\n\nVolatility is only one measure of risk. We prefer to look at the worst losses. Global high-yield bonds actually have a larger worst monthly loss of 18 per cent relative to Aussie shares\u2019 worst monthly drawdown of 14 per cent. Another risk metric is the peak-to-trough loss. Here again, floating-rate global high yield in US dollars is similar to equities with a maximum 42 per cent loss during the GFC versus the 48 per cent loss suffered by listed shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis analysis suggests global high yield has a similar risk-and-return profile to shares. One difference is liquidity. It is easier to buy and sell shares on an exchange than it is to exit over-the-counter sub-investment-grade bonds. One alternative is simply to buy high-yielding defensive equities.\n\nAnother wrinkle is knowledge. Retail investors know a lot more about large listed companies than they do about the biggest members of the global high-yield index, such as Telecom Italia, Tenet Healthcare, Altice France, Petrobras, Bausch Health or Sprint Corporation. That can be a good and bad thing \u2013 diversification is valuable but information asymmetries can create sales risks.\n\nAn obvious question is how listed hybrids fit into this mix. Between 2007 and 2019, ASX hybrids have had half the return volatility of the global high-yield index. Their worst monthly losses have also been about half that of high yield (peak-to-trough losses were likewise smaller).\n\nPerformance has been similar, with the ASX hybrid index\u2019s 6.6 per cent annual return over the last five years beating global high yield with and without duration risk. This is despite the fact that major bank hybrids have substantially superior credit ratings to most high-yield bonds. Indeed, on Thursday Standard & Poor\u2019s sensationally upgraded major bank hybrids from a \u201chigh-yield\u201d BB+ credit rating to the all-important \u201cinvestment grade\u201d band (via a BBB- rating), satisfying one of our boldest predictions.\n\nSince July 2017 I\u2019ve repeatedly forecast that S &P would upgrade the major banks\u2019 hybrid and subordinated bond ratings, which is the outworking of a complex sequence of subsidiary projections. (We don\u2019t know any other analysts who shared this view.)\n\nThe logic is as follows. First, in 2017 we predicted that the federal budget would return to surplus years ahead of S &P\u2019s and the market\u2019s expectations, removing a key economic risk. In April 2017 we also forecast that the housing boom would turn into an orderly 10 per cent correction, mitigating Australia\u2019s biggest financial stability hazard. Both these events came to pass. Finally, in April 2019 we were the first to call the sharp recovery in house prices, which is playing out.\n\nThe coalescing of these predictions informed our conviction that S &P would upgrade Australia\u2019s \u201ceconomic risk score\u201d, which it downgraded in May 2017 on housing bubble fears. This has the consequence of reducing the risk weightings S &P assumes when estimating the major banks\u2019 \u201crisk-adjusted capital\u201d (RAC) ratios, which in turn boosts them above a critical 10 per cent threshold.\n\nAPRA\u2019s boss Wayne Byres had previously stated that securing RAC ratios over 10 per cent was a valuable goal for the big banks, because it would lift their stand-alone credit profiles (SACPs) from \u201ca-\u201d to \u201ca\u201d. (When we aired this possibility with the banks many months prior, they laughed at us.)\n\nThe higher SACP automatically raises the credit ratings on the major banks\u2019 hybrids and subordinated bonds by one notch (hybrids go to BBB- while sub debt jumps to BBB+). It also reduces the government support assumption underpinning the majors\u2019 AA- senior bond ratings from three notches to two, which is positive for these assets.\n\nCredit for these outcomes can be attributed to prudent fiscal policy, the 2015 resolution of both the government and APRA to force the banks to effectively halve their risk-weighted leverage, and APRA\u2019s efforts since 2014 to thwart housing bubble risks by requiring banks to lend much more carefully.", "description": "Mums and dads are piling into junk bonds without understanding they're assuming substantial risk that could inflict 40 per cent losses on their portfolios in a crisis, writes Christopher Joye.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7062%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_54/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/94c8e5faefbe750d765ac9911ef280264cf0bd39", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
