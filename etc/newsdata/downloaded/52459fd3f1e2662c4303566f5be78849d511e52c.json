The phone\u2019s original successor was nixed, but now we have the first confirmation the company does indeed have another product on the way, dubbed Project GEM.\n\nFirst Andy Rubin tweeted some mysterious no-context images today \u2013 his first non-reply tweet since responding to a New York Times report about alleged sexual misconduct. In the new tweets he shows off new devices with what seems to be the longest aspect ratio we\u2019ve seen on a smartphone yet, as well as a unique new UI:\n\nNew UI for radically different formfactor pic.twitter.com/Es8hFrTuxx \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) October 8, 2019\n\nGEM Colorshift material pic.twitter.com/QJStoiDleH \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) October 8, 2019\n\nAt the time, it wasn\u2019t clear whether it was actually an Essential Phone or some new project altogether, but then the company sent out a more official tweet:\n\nWe've been working on a new device to reframe your perspective on mobile. It's now in early testing with our team outside the lab. Look forward to sharing more in the near future! #ProjectGEM pic.twitter.com/BnVy7yM2Kj \u2014 Essential (@essential) October 9, 2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s all we know. Though neither Rubin nor Essential actually specifically say the word \u2018phone\u2019 \u2013 they just refer to it as some new kind of mobile device \u2013 there is a phone icon on the home screen in the Essential tweet.\n\nLess clear is whether the device actually even runs Android. It\u2019s hard to imagine Rubin shying away from the OS he helped create \u2013 especially after the Essential Phone made a big deal out of delivering a \u2018pure\u2019 Android experience, but the new UI is definitely different from anything we\u2019ve seen. Perhaps a new skin was necessary to accommodate the strange shape. At least we know it runs Spotify, I guess.\n\nIt\u2019s a weird design, but you know what? I kind of dig it. Phones all look the same nowadays, and between this and the Surface Duo, it\u2019s nice to see new form factors emerge. It\u2019s obviously not the most ideal shape for viewing images or video, but it could make for good multi-tasking for running two apps side by side (if it can even do that). I\u2019m sure Essential has some reasoning for the shape.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Essential and will let you konw if we find out more.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FEssential-Project-GEM.jpg&signature=dbb9c0fbee42a3de95e035bc89a6898a", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
