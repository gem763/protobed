He was raped by Frank in the 60s and 70s, and gave evidence to the royal commission under the pseudonym AHA.\n\nBrian Houston says he 'genuinely doesn\u2019t know' if PM wanted him at White House dinner Read more\n\nSengstock has repeatedly questioned why Brian failed to alert police to his father\u2019s crimes when Frank Houston confessed his guilt in 1999.\n\nIn an interview on Channel Ten\u2019s The Project on Sunday, Sengstock said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that Morrison, after becoming prime minister, would go on stage with Houston at Hillsong. Morrison addressed the opening session of the church\u2019s annual conference in July.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the audacity. Here\u2019s the prime minister of this country on stage with Brian Houston [who] is currently under investigation by New South Wales police for concealing the crimes of his father, and up there with their arms around each other. I am absolutely lost for words.\u201d\n\nThe Project (@theprojecttv) Last month US media reported the White House vetoed one of Scott Morrison\u2019s guests for Donald Trump\u2019s state dinner. This raised lots of questions, which still haven\u2019t been answered. 1/2 pic.twitter.com/ivcXdzpkt2\n\nLast month the Wall Street Journal reported that Morrison wanted Houston in his entourage for the state dinner with US president Donald Trump in September, but the White House shot down the idea.\n\nIn an interview with 2GB host Ben Fordham on Thursday, Brian Houston said Sengstock told Houston he did not want the police informed, at the time the church leader found out about his father\u2019s abuse.\n\n\u201cHe told me that he didn\u2019t want the police involved,\u201d Houston said. \u201cAnd the reality is that the law itself actually spells out that very circumstance \u2013 that if an adult victim doesn\u2019t want the police involved, that\u2019s a reasonable excuse for not including the police.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the New Daily later on Thursday, Sengstock denied he had said that.\n\nHouston told Fordham the investigation remained open only because no charges had been laid, and until that happened it would always be open.\n\nNSW police have confirmed that the investigation remains open with the Hills area command, but declined to comment further.\n\nThe royal commission referred Brian Houston to NSW police because he did not report his father\u2019s abuse to police.\n\nIn Houston\u2019s submission to the commission, he makes it clear he believed at the time that Sengstock did not want to report the matter to police.\n\nHouston told the royal commission at the time that because Sengstock was an adult it was \u201chis prerogative\u201d to report it to police, and he did not want it reported. Houston\u2019s lawyers at the time argued if that were not a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d as defined in law, than others, including Sengstock and his mother, were also potentially in breach of the law.\n\nHouston confronted his father in November 1999 and said he suspended his father from preaching. He claimed Frank \u201cnever ever preached anywhere again\u201d after that.\n\nIn December 1999, the national executive of the Assemblies of God decided that Frank Houston\u2019s credentials would be withdrawn.\n\nBut evidence given to the commission showed Frank Houston was allowed to resign from his position in the church in 2000 and retire with financial support from the church \u201cwithout damage to his reputation or the reputation of Hillsong Church\u201d.\n\nFrank\u2019s letter in November 2000 stated he was resigning \u201cas I feel it is time for Hazel and I to enter retirement\u201d.\n\nIn a December 2001 letter to ministers of the church marked \u201cextremely confidential\u201d, the church\u2019s vice president, Keith Ainge, laid out the reasons for Frank Houston\u2019s departure and the \u201cgreat anguish\u201d it was causing Brian, and warned ministers not to speak publicly about it.\n\n\u201cWe cannot see any reason for this to be announced to your church or further afield. Sadly there are always one or two people with their own agendas who will try and get mileage from other people\u2019s pain,\u201d Ainge said.\n\nThe church admitted it didn\u2019t follow some of the procedures required at the time, and the royal commission found that Houston had a conflict of interest in heading the organisation as it handled the complaints investigation against his father.\n\nThe Newcastle Herald reported last week it had obtained a recording from 2004, the year Frank died, that showed Frank giving a sermon at a Maitland church.\n\nIn that sermon, Frank can be heard referring to an eight-year-old boy as \u201cgood looking\u201d.\n\nHillsong has said it will sign up to the federal government\u2019s $4bn national redress scheme established after the royal commission, but has yet to do so.\n\nThe prime minister refused to say whether Houston\u2019s name was put forward for the White House state dinner. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, also declined to answer in Senate estimates last week.\n\nOfficials raised concerns that providing information on who was put forward on a list of potential invitees could \u201cprejudice international relations\u201d.", "description": "Brett Sengstock questions \u2018audacity\u2019 of Scott Morrison appearing on stage with Houston", "authors": ["Josh Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4950b5a41c6925dea58c9ac710e6ac47e85425ea/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c9f2959f7f3a227c1c7f46ebaba6d95", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
