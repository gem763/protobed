AAP\n\nIt said public criticism of energy companies \"gouging\" customers, which motivated the big stick legislation, did not appear to match the reality, and said energy suppliers' profits had not increased anywhere near as much as prices.\n\n\"Bashing big companies may be good politics, but it is bad policy,\" Grattan said. \"The energy sector is likely to need more than $400 billion in new utility-scale generation assets over the next 30 years. A functioning market will draw this capital from private investors, rather than requiring governments to increase debt or taxes, or to divert capital away from transport, education and health projects.\"\n\nIt labelled the federal government's fight to defer the closure of Liddell as \"concerning\", and blamed it for creating uncertainty for potential investors looking to replace the capacity.\n\nGrattan also criticised the federal government's approach of \"picking winners\" through direct involvement in generation through Snowy 2.0 and through the UNGI program. It said that wholesale prices were, in any case, expected to fall towards the government's end-2021 target of $70 a megawatt-hour.\n\n\"The impending entry of Snowy 2.0 and an unknown number of the 12 short-listed UNGI projects, is very likely to have dissuaded any delayed other investments,\" it said, noting that private investors delivered 4 gigawatts of new dispatchable capacity when the market last needed it in 2005-09, without significant intervention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Unless governments seek to abandon the market and re-nationalise the sector, it is in their interest to ensure that the market delivers,\" it said. \"But this requires a change of direction.\"\n\nYet Grattan does single out two areas where the government could act to encourage investment through the transition to cleaner energy, using transparent rules-based policies rather than ad hoc moves.\n\nOne of these is managing the closure of coal generators, where Grattan suggests that plant owners put funds into escrow to ensure they comply with nominated closure dates to protect consumers and drive timely investment in replacement plant.\n\nThe other is in investment in electricity transmission, where Grattan proposes that governments help reduce the six or seven years required to plan and deliver new projects by allowing networks to recover the cost of early planning works, even if a project doesn't proceed.\n\nOn coal plant closures, the think-tank recommends strengthening the current rules regarding giving three years notice of closure, saying the penalties for non-compliance are too small to be effective while there is no safeguard against power station owners extending the lives of their plants longer.\n\nIt proposes a system where generators would have to pay a fee into an escrow fund for every megawatt-hour generated once a closure date is nominated, with the fund potentially reaching almost $4 billion in the early 2030s. The funds would be used by the market operator to deal with any reliability problems if a plant is closed early or would be returned to customers if it closed late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that proposal caused concern at the Australian Energy Council, which represents suppliers. It described it as \"yet another intervention that would raise serious challenges\".\n\n\"If the market improvements advocated in the report are implemented - and most of these are supported by industry - then there shouldn\u2019t be the need for this further intervention,\" a council spokesman said.\n\nOn new transmission projects, Grattan suggested starting early planning work before a full cost-benefit analysis was carried out on a proposed regulated line, potentially cutting 12-18 months from the project timeline. Governments could fund or underwrite early planning work, resolving transmission companies' concerns that they would not be able to recover those costs from consumers.", "description": "Ineffective government fiddling is stifling investment in the energy market and will ultimately drive up prices and imperil reliability, a new report warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6132%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/95def4290159476eaf89f678db840e62042c8d87", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
