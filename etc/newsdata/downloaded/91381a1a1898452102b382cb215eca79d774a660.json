It says it is working to reduce the amount of water used in agriculture.\n\nHydrologists consider a country to be facing water scarcity if supplies drop below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year.\n\nEgypt currently has around 570 cubic meters per person per year, a figure that is expected to drop to 500 cubic meters by 2025, without taking into account any reduction in supply caused by GERD, Egyptian officials said.\n\nEthiopia is expected to start filling the GERD reservoir next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Susan Fenton)", "description": "Egypt sees the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) as an existential risk, fearing it will threaten scarce water supplies in Egypt and power generation at its own dam in Aswan.
