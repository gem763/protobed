The bill was withdrawn earlier this month, but the protests have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nHong Kong awarded virtual banking licenses to three groups in March - joint ventures led by StanChart and BOC Hong Kong, and a subsidiary of the international arm of Chinese online insurer ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance.\n\nThe banks intended to launch services in six-to-nine months, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said at that time.\n\nFive more licenses were issued later to joint ventures led by smartphone maker Xiaomi and Tencent, and a unit of Ant Financial among others.\n\nHKMA said starting six-to-nine months after authorization was \"not a rigid requirement\", but services were expected to be rolled out to the public in the fourth quarter at the earliest based on the virtual banks' latest indications.\n\nStanChart said its virtual bank joint venture was working toward a launch in early 2020. Livi VB Ltd, the virtual banking joint venture led by BOC Hong Kong, said it was working toward the launch in the near future. ZhongAn declined to comment.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Xiaomi-led joint venture said the virtual banking business was in the preparation stage, while Ant said that work for its bank was progressing smoothly. Tencent led-Fusion bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSOFT LAUNCH\n\nA couple of the license winners could still 'soft launch' in 2019, restricting services to staff and their families ahead of a full launch, the people said.\n\nThe virtual banks plan to offer savings accounts, credit cards, personal loans and travel insurance, and will try to take market share from HSBC, StanChart and some Chinese lenders who currently dominate retail banking in Hong Kong.\n\nThe launch delay is also partly due to the time required to build technology infrastructure, compliance and customer acquisition processes, and hire staff, the people said.\n\n\"This is about building a new bank from ground zero, with regulatory standards that are similar to traditional banks,\" one person said.", "description": "Hong Kong digital banks launch faces delay due to protests: sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8G21H_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
