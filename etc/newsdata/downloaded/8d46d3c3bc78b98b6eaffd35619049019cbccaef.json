REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\n\nThe suit was filed in federal court in northern California and announced by Attorney General Xavier Becerra at a wildlife area in Davis, California.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us wants a museum to be the only place these children will be able to see a southern sea otter or the desert tortoise,\u201d Becerra said.\n\n\u201cBut if we don\u2019t act, that\u2019s a real possibility.\u201d\n\nThe suit, led by California, Maryland and Massachusetts, comes a month after the U.S. Department of Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service and the Commerce Department\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service announced final revisions to the 1970s-era Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe revisions ended a practice of automatically extending the same protections for endangered species to threatened species. They also prohibit the designation of critical habitat for species threatened by climate change and struck down language that downplayed the economic cost of safeguarding animals.\n\n\u201cThese are long overdue and necessary regulatory changes that will recover more imperiled species facing extinction than previously accomplished over the span of this law,\u201d Department of Interior spokesman Nick Goodwin said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWe will see them in court, and we will be steadfast in our implementation of this important act to improve conservation efforts across the country.\u201d\n\nCalifornia said at the time the revisions were disclosed that it would sue to block them.\n\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s rules throw science and data out the window by injecting economic considerations into what should be a science-driven decision,\u201d Becerra said at the press conference, which was streamed on the internet.\n\n\u201cWhether or not an animal should be protected should not be a question of whether it will help or impede corporate profits.\u201d\n\nThe Endangered Species Act is credited with bringing back from the brink of extinction species such as bald eagles, gray whales and grizzly bears, but the law has long been a source of frustration for drilling and mining companies, and other industries because new listings can put vast areas of land off-limits to development.\n\nThe weakening of the act\u2019s protections is one of many moves by U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, to roll back existing regulations and boost oil, gas and coal production, as well as grazing, ranching and logging on federal land.\n\nIn addition to Massachusetts and Maryland, California was joined in the suit by Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the cities of Washington D.C. and New York.", "description": "California and 16 other U.S. states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its efforts to weaken protections for endangered species.", "authors": ["Nichola Groom", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433920096&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O1RI", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
