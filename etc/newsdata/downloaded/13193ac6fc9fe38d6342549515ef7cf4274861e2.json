RWC100: 100-81 1/21 Which Rugby World Cup star will come out on top? 2/21 100: Michael Leitch The Japan captain is preparing to lead the side into yet another World Cup, but he proved an inspiring figure in 2015 as his phenomenal work-rate set the example for those around him. He will forever be remembered as the man who lead the side that defeated the Springboks. Getty Images 3/21 99: Lewis Moody A member of the 2003 winning squad, Moody went on to feature on the 2007 run to the final before captaining the ill0fated 2011 campaign. However, with three tournaments under his belt and his sheer bravery in every one of his performances, he just squeezes onto the list. Getty Images 4/21 98: Ben Franks The two-time Rugby World Cup winner lined up in the same front-row as younger brother Owen to help the All Blacks to back-to-back world championships, before heading to Europe. Getty Images 5/21 97: Diego Dominguez A legend of the Italian game. Dominguez played at three consecutive World Cups between 1991 and 1999 and displayed a talent at fly-half that is yet to be displayed since. Getty Images 6/21 96: Toutai Kefu It takes something special to oust Willie Ofahengaue from the Australian No 8 shirt, but Kefu was able to do exactly that to play a pivotal role as the Wallabies' starting No 8 at the triumphant Rugby World Cup. Getty Images 7/21 95: Va'aiga Tuigamala 'Inga the winger' has the unusual accolade of playing at two Rugby World Cups for two different nations. He arrived on the scene with New Zealand in 1991, but it was his role in 1999 with Western Samoa that really caught the eye as he helped them defeat Wales. AFP/Getty Images 8/21 94: Sebastien Chabal A World Cup winner he is not, but Chabal provided one of the great moments in the tournament's history as he lead the confrontation to the Haka ahead of France's 2007 World Cup quarter-final victory over the All Blacks. AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93: Mamuka Gorgodze Probably no better example of a man who has carried a national team on his own shoulders. Gorgodze was famously named man of the match against New Zealand, and his reaction said all that you needed to know about what it means to him to play for Georgia. AFP/Getty Images 10/21 92: Mickey Skinner Who can forget 'The Tackle'? Mick 'The Munch' Skinner sent Marc Cecillon in reverse with one fo the great World Cup tackles during England's quarter-final victory at the 1991 tournament. Getty Images 11/21 91: Stephen Donald Not New Zealand's first choice, or second, or third, but the fourth-choice fly-half who wasn't even named in the All Blacks squad for the 2011 World Cup. Injuries meant he was drafted in for the final against France, where he wrote his name into the history books by kicking the final-winning penalty to end the All Blacks' 24 years of hurt. AFP/Getty Images 12/21 90: Takudza Ngwenya Bryan Habana was considered that fastest man at the World Cup - until Ngwenya turned up and completely roasted him on the outside. The United States may have gone on to lose the match, but the moment remains one of the 2007 tournament highlights. AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89: Thierry Lacroix Lacroix's international career never really took off until the 1999 World Cup when a scintillating 30-minute display paved the way for the All Blacks's dramatic exit. AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88: Karne Hesketh If this list was judged on moments alone, Hesketh would be No 1 on the list. The Japan wing finished one of the great tries to secure their first ever victory over the Springboks, a moment where everyone who was watching remembers exactly where they were at that moment in time. Getty Images 15/21 87: Andrew Sheridan Sheridan played in two World Cup, but is fondly remembered for the way he dismantled the Australian scrum in 2007 to form the basis for England's quarter-final victory. Getty Images 16/21 86: Josh Lewsey Lewsey was one-third of England's elite back-three at the 2003 World Cup, but his tournament highlight came in 2007 when he scored inside 80 seconds in the semi-final victory over France. Getty Images 17/21 85: Will Genia An Australian centurion who was first-choice scrum-half in both 2011 and 2015, where he claimed third and second-place finishes respectively. Will 2019 be the year he goes one better? Getty Images 18/21 84: Will Greenwood The centre enjoyed a phenomenal World Cup try-scoring record of seven in nine matches across 1999 and 2003, going on to help England triumph Down Under. Getty Images 19/21 83: Gavin Hastings Arguably Scotland's greatest ever player, who featured across three World Cups - the final one in 1995 as captain - before hanging up his boots after their quarter-final defeat against the Springboks. Getty Images 20/21 82: David Pocock The main reason that Australia made it to the 2015 Rugby World Cup final, Pocock starred playing out of position in a partnership with Michael Hooper that has strongly influenced the 2019 tournament as other teams follow suit. Getty Images 21/21 81: Tendai Mtawarira Despite his nickname of 'The Beast', Tendai Mtawarira is possibly one of the most understated greats of the game. Fans love him and for good reason, having helped South Africa to third place in 2015.
