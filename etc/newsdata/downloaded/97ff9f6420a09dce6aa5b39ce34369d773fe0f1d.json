It had an average of 6.9 million viewers. \u201cBig Bang,\u201d long a ratings juggernaut for the network, aired the last of its 12 seasons last year.\n\nNBC won on the back of the NFL, with the matchup of the Dallas Cowboys and New Orleans Saints making \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d the week\u2019s runaway No. 1 show. Nielsen says the game had 24.1 million viewers, which is more than 6 million clear of the No. 2 show, the Philadelphia Eagles and Green Bay Packers matchup Thursday night on Fox.\n\nNBC also rode the \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d pregame programming, two episodes of \u201cThe Voice\u201d and the season premieres of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201dChicago Med\u201d and \u201cChicago Fire.\u201d\n\nCBS had the only scripted shows in the top 10 with the dramas \u201cNCIS\u201d and \u201cFBI.\u201d\n\nThe last time NBC won the week in total viewers was 2001. \u201cFriends\u201d was still on the air, one of the few remaining remnants of its Thursday night dominance that began with \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d in the 1980s.\n\nBut for both NBC and CBS, the numbers were down from the comparable week last season as viewers continue to seek streaming and other options for viewing.\n\nNBC actually had more average viewers than this year in the first week of fall 2018 - 7.7 million - but that was well short of CBS and its 8.3 million.\n\nFox used its own football surge to finish third with 5.8 million. ABC was fourth with 4.7 million.\n\nFox News Channel was the week\u2019s most popular cable network, averaging 2.63 million viewers in prime time as all cable news channels saw a slight uptick in viewership, possibly stemming from news of the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump. ESPN had 2.16 million, MSNBC had 1.94 million, CNN had 1.12 million and USA had 1 million.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8 million viewers. NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d was second with 7.3 million, and the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d had 5 million viewers.\n\nFor the week of Sept. 23-29, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: NFL Football: Dallas at New Orleans, NBC, 24.1 million; NFL Football: Philadelphia at Green Bay, Fox, 17.9 million; \u201cSunday Night NFL Pre-Kick,\u201d NBC, 16.54 million; \u201cNCIS,\u201d CBS, 12.58 million; \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d CBS, 11.8 million; \u201cFootball Night in America,\u201d NBC, 12.26 million; \u201cThursday Night NFL Pre-Kick,\u201d Fox, 10.12 million; NFL Football: Chicago at Washington, ESPN, 10.61 million; \u201cThe Voice,\u201d NBC, 8.94 million; \u201cFBI,\u201d CBS, 8.83 million.\n\n___\n\nABC is owned by The Walt Disney Co.
