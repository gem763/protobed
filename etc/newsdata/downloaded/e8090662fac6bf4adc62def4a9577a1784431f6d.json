They would both be moving away, but Coats had barely been going over the previous few months anyway\u2014as she said over email, she felt like she could \u201cfinally function as a human being without needing to cry to my therapist every week\u201d\u2014so it was still a natural end.\n\nOver the next couple of months, though, a lot happened for Coats. Completing her move across the country, driving around a big city by herself, and flying in an airplane had been major points of anxiety for her, but she did them all, accomplishing more than she\u2019d ever thought she\u2019d would by 19 years old, and she wanted to share those successes with her former therapist.\n\n\u201cI was so excited and proud, and while my friends and family were happy for me as well, I just had this overwhelming need to tell her, to show her how everything I learned from her worked,\u201d Coats said.\n\nShe admits she felt \u201ca little stupid,\u201d about wanting to reach out. After all, she wasn\u2019t paying her therapist anymore.\n\nYou may not hesitate to reconnect with an old friend with whom you used to talk to regularly, or to update a helpful teacher or mentor on your accomplishments. When it comes to a therapist who you paid to listen to you, though, it may feel more complicated. But missing your former therapist is completely normal, experts say.\n\n\u201cGenerally I would just tell someone, \u2018That makes sense,\u2019\u201d said Laura Reagan, a clinical social worker and trauma therapist in Maryland who hosts the Therapy Chat podcast. \u201cNot having the same ongoing connection and interaction with them that you used to can be hard, and that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nThe exact way you forge that connection with your therapist may vary, depending on what type of therapy they specialize in (say, cognitive behavioral therapy or psychoanalysis). But whatever the technique, the most important factor for improving someone\u2019s well being, studies have found, is that patient-therapist relationship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually considered a good sign in therapy if you start to think about your therapist when you\u2019re not in therapy,\u201d Reagan said. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying them with you instead of just, it\u2019s someone who sits in a room and they\u2019re there when you show up and you talk to them and you leave and you forget about them until next time. If you can allow yourself to really trust that person, it can be one of the deepest types relationships you can have.\u201d\n\nThat relationship is, by design, one-sided (even if a therapist shares small details about themselves), but both parties can feel that connection. As Daniel Walinsky, an associate professor in Temple University\u2019s counseling psychology program, said, \u201cWe make impressions on each other.\u201d\n\nThat was certainly the case for Brooke Buonauro who, at 19, saw a bereavement therapist as part of a parent loss support group on her college\u2019s campus. Now 24, Buonaruo said she can\u2019t imagine her life if she had never met that counselor; she was a \u201ckeeper of stories and memories of our parents,\u201d Buonauro said, and even shared that she had lost both of her parents at relatively young ages.\n\nSo when Buonauro graduated, she missed her therapist and the bond they formed over four semesters. That therapist actually organized a reunion breakfast for support group students who had graduated\u2014timed to be between Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day\u2014and Buonauro enjoyed the chance to catch up.\n\nThat\u2019s a rare situation though. Walinsky said it violates most therapists\u2019 ethics codes to reach out to former clients. (The fact that Buonauro was involved in a campus group may be the differentiating factor). Once that professional relationship is over, it would be on the client to ever reach out.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI would always welcome past clients to send me an email and let me know how they're doing,\u201d a sentiment echoed by other therapists I spoke to. Walkinsky himself recently emailed a therapist after he moved from the Boston area to Philadelphia (yes, plenty of therapist see a therapist, too) to update them on things they had specifically talked about.\n\nWalinsky said he personally would respond to an update, but if it got to the point where he and a former client were emailing back and forth, that couldn\u2019t continue very long. Reach out, say hello, give an update, but don\u2019t expect to reopen that relationship or have things go back to how they were when you were working together.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s something you feel like you need,\u201d he added, \u201cthat\u2019s a great time to go back into therapy, either with that person or someone else.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think about what you want to get out of reaching out to a former therapist, said Rachel Kazez, a licensed therapist and founder of All Along, a service to help people find therapists and better understand mental health. It\u2019s totally valid to want to let them know how you\u2019re doing or to thank them for their help, but you shouldn\u2019t do it if you\u2019re searching for more support (unless you\u2019re trying to be their client again) or attempting to change the parameters of that relationship, like by asking to hang out or be friends.\n\n\u201cDo things that are low pressure and put the therapist in some control of how much interaction there is,\u201d she said, like \u201csending an email or text, leaving a voicemail, or a phone call where you say, \u2018Hey this is just a quick call.\u2019\u201d\n\nCoats did recently email her former therapist and got a response back that her desire to reach out \u201cwasn\u2019t stupid at all,\u201d and that she could go ahead and share what had happened over the past few months. They emailed back and forth a few times, and though they haven\u2019t talked again since, Coats said she\u2019s happy she reached out.\n\nThat sort of update may be satisfying for therapists, as well. Though they can\u2019t ever email you to see how you\u2019re doing, they may still be curious, Reagan said.\n\n\u201cEven though the therapeutic relationship has ended, we\u2019re still people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe carry in our hearts the clients that we worked with and wonder how they're doing or whatever happened to them.\u201d\n\nIdeally, you would talk about this boundary before ending therapy, and most professionals will bring up in a final session what, if any at all, post-working together contact looks like. If it\u2019s something you didn\u2019t get to discuss for some reason and you\u2019re unsure if you\u2019re update would be welcomed, Regan\u2019s advice is simple: \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Well have you thought about just reaching out and asking?\u2019\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Kristin Toussaint on Twitter.", "description": "Here\u2019s how to handle the urge to reach out to them again.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5daf43233075cc000aa6a809/lede/1571768922036-tolu-bamwo-nappy-1.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8427xh;0xw,0.0448xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
