(Reuters/Jonathan Ernst)\n\nThe congressional Republicans fiercely defending President Trump's conduct in a July phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart are leaning on a legal technicality.\n\nThe president, they say, did nothing wrong by pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate one of his chief 2020 rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, because he never framed the request as an explicit quid pro quo in exchange for military aid.\n\nCritics say the argument is extremely tenuous: Any rational person reading the rough transcript of the call would understand Trump made clear Zelensky should open a probe to ensure the release of the $390 million aid package.\n\nYet Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), describing the threshold for a quid pro quo, suggested the president would have needed to say something like, \u201c\u2018Uh, hey pal, you know, you need to like, go after the Bidens or I ain\u2019t gonna give you any money.\u2019 He\u2019d be really, like, thuggish about it.\u201d\n\nSome election law experts say Graham has a point: Through a series of decisions over the past two decades, courts have raised the bar almost impossibly high for prosecutors seeking to prove public officials have traded their power for personal gain. The resulting dynamic undergirds Washington\u2019s swamp economy \u2014 a system protecting the outsize influence of donors and lobbyists by allowing them to keep goodies flowing to policymakers, while ensuring those in power don\u2019t face scrutiny for horse-trading.\n\n\u201cQuid pro quo being a high legal standard is a fair point,\u201d says Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, \u201cthough the words in that phone call come a lot closer to proving quid pro quo than you see in a lot of cases.\u201d\n\nThe case that began chipping away at the public corruption standard unfolded in the shadow of the last presidential impeachment. Two weeks before President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House in December 1998, a federal court acquitted his agriculture secretary, Mike Espy, of corruptly taking sports tickets and other lavish gifts from lobbyists for companies he regulated. Prosecutors said Espy accepted $34,000 worth of sports tickets, luggage and other lavish gifts from lobbyists. But the court found Espy hadn\u2019t violated an illegal gratuities statute in doing so, because prosecutors failed to prove he took any official action in exchange.\n\n\u201cGoing into that case, people thought this was pretty straightforward,\u201d says the Brookings Institution\u2019s Darrell West. \u201cBut what it revealed is that you have to demonstrate you got a benefit and you did something in return \u2026 Trump could easily defend himself by saying he just wanted to establish warm relations between the two countries, and he wasn't doing something in return for a campaign benefit.\u201d\n\nWest said the Espy verdict had a chilling effect on public corruption cases. And decisions in subsequent cases further eroded the legal standard.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has helped turn the tide. A 2010 ruling involving the former Enron executive Jeff Skilling, for example, narrowed the so-called honest-services fraud statute. \u201cThe court restricted the use of the provision to only the most egregious forms of fraud, such as bribery and kickbacks, disallowing the charge for grayer types of corporate malfeasance,\u201d Jesse Eisinger writes in the book \"The Chicken**** Club.\u201d\n\nBookbinder says while the decision was aimed primarily at corporate defendants, it had a spillover effect for public officials facing potential corruption charges, as well.\n\nThe high court in 2016 ripped some more pages from the prosecutors\u2019 playbook by unanimously overturning the conviction on public corruption charges of Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell. The Republican had taken more than $175,000 in loans and gifts from a Richmond businessman who wanted state universities to test a dietary supplement his company had developed.\n\nBut as The Post\u2019s Robert Barnes wrote at the time, the tests were never conducted and the gifts didn\u2019t violate state law. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts reasoned, \u201cThere is no doubt that this case is distasteful; it may be worse than that. But our concern is not with tawdry tales of Ferraris, Rolexes, and ball gowns. It is instead with the broader legal implications of the Government\u2019s boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute.\u201d\n\nThese laws are written, of course, by people subject to them. \u201cThey\u2019re looking to protect themselves, and the laws have been interpreted very narrowly by the courts,\u201d Bookbinder says. \u201cCourts can be very sympathetic to public officials. Judges don't seem to like broad public corruption laws.\u201d\n\nWhether that stems from judicial philosophy or an interest in avoiding antagonizing another branch of government, the upshot has been good for the swamp. In the 20 years since the Espy decision, spending on federal lobbying alone has more than doubled, from $1.45 billion in 1998 to $3.46 billion last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nGeorge Brown, one of the prosecutors in the Espy case who now teaches at the Boston College of Law, says in Trump\u2019s case, \u201cif I was a lawyer in the House, I would say even though I can't point to a statute, that doesn\u2019t mean this is not grounds for impeachment\u2026 We don\u2019t have a federal crime of \u2018abuse of office.\u2019 But this is an abuse of office.\u201d\n\nAnd Democrats who have now launched a formal impeachment inquiry don\u2019t need to meet a legal standard to press ahead. The Constitution gives lawmakers wide latitude to determine what constitutes presidential \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201d And Trump may have broken the law anyway, since it is a crime to solicit a campaign contribution from a foreign citizen, and a foreign corruption probe aimed at a rival arguably constitutes an in-kind donation.\n\nTrump and his defenders nevertheless continue emphasizing the lack of an explicit deal between the president and Zelensky. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham tweeted it:\n\n\u274c Myth: The President made a \u201cpromise\u201d to Zelensky in return for reviving an investigation relating to Joe Biden and Hunter Biden.\n\n\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Fact: There was no promise. The President wanted allegations of corruption potentially involving an American official to be investigated. \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 26, 2019\n\nThe talking points the White House distributed to congressional Republicans \u2014 which they accidentally sent to Democratic offices, as well, before trying to recall them \u2014 led with the no-quid-pro-quo argument. And some top Republicans on the Hill are sticking with it:\n\nWe have the transcript.\n\n\n\nSo why did Schiff make up his own version of the call in a Congressional hearing?\n\n\n\nBecause he knows the transcript shows no quid pro quo or crimes.\n\n\n\nDems are literally making stuff up now because they have no legitimate reason to impeach @realDonaldTrump. pic.twitter.com/i4138ocqJ3 \u2014 Steve Scalise (@SteveScalise) September 26, 2019\n\nFormer Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.

The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, fell to 212,000, the lowest since late July.\u201d\n\nConsumer confidence is also dropping: \u201cU.S. consumer comfort fell for a third week as views of the buying climate dimmed to the weakest level since June, adding to signs consumer spending will moderate after the strongest quarter since 2014,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s William Edwards reports. \u201cThe Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index slipped to 61.7 in the week ended Sept. 22 from 62.7 the prior week, data released Thursday show. The buying gauge eased to 54.3 from 54.5 with views on personal finances and the national economy also posting declines.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Business investment drop-off was steeper than we thought. Reuters's Lucia Mutikani: \"U.S. business investment contracted more sharply than previously estimated in the second quarter and corporate profit growth was tepid, casting a shadow on an economy that is being stalked by financial market fears of a recession... The soft investment and sluggish profit gains, reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, could raise doubts on consumers\u2019 ability to continue driving the economy...\n\n\"Business investment declined at a 1.0% annualized rate last quarter, the government said in its third reading of second-quarter gross domestic product. That was the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2015.\"\n\n\u2014 Housing gains are underwhelming: \u201cThe housing market is a bit better lately. But considering the overall economic environment, the improvement still counts as underwhelming,\u201d the WSJ\u2019s Justin Lahart reports.\n\n\u201cThe National Association of Realtors reported that its index of pending home sales \u2014 sales of previously owned homes that are under contract but haven\u2019t been finalized \u2014 bounced back in August, putting it 2.5% above its year-earlier level. That follows \u2026 [the] Commerce Department report showing that new-home sales jumped last month and last week\u2019s report that existing-home sales firmed in August.\u201d\n\nPutting the gains in perspective: \u201cCombined new- and existing-home sales have gotten back only to where they were in the beginning of last year. And they are about level with where they were in 2000, when the U.S. population was significantly lower than it is now.\u201d\n\nTrump warns again that the stock market would crash if he is impeached \"Do you think it was luck that got us to the best Stock Market and Economy in our history.

Customers there kept buying oak and ash boards in large quantities, while construction and furniture production fell in the U.S. Now, after Beijing placed retaliatory tariffs of up to 25% on imports of lumber and other U.S. wood products, exports of hardwood lumber to China have fallen 40% this year.\u201d\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nA sign is posted during a demonstration outside a General Motors facility in Langhorne, Pa.

(Yuri Gripas/Bloomberg)\n\n\u2014 SEC finalizes rule to encourage IPOs. Reuters's Katanga Johnson: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday finalized a new rule that allows all companies to privately sound out prospective investors before filing for a stock exchange listing. The so-called 'testing-the-waters' rule, which currently only applies to smaller firms preparing to go public, will now be extended to all prospective issuers hoping to gauge broader market interest before filing registration statements for initial public offerings, the SEC said.\n\n\"The move, which the agency\u2019s commissioners unanimously voted to approve on Wednesday, is part of a broader push by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to make it easier for companies to go public, amid worries that a 50 percent decline in U.S. listings over the past two decades is hurting investors.\"\n\nThe context: Big-ticket IPOs have been a big disappointment this year, as the NYT's Matt Phillips, Stephen Grocer and Erin Griffith report: \"This was supposed to be the year when America\u2019s biggest start-ups would finally make their triumphant debut on the stock market. Billionaire Silicon Valley investors, sneaker-clad founders and button-down bankers all expected enormous stock sales to turn companies like Uber, Lyft and WeWork into a new generation of corporate giants.\n\n\"It hasn\u2019t quite turned out that way. Last week, WeWork postponed its planned initial public offering. Uber and Lyft sold shares earlier this year only to see their prices collapse.
