Television channels also showed footage of the incident.\n\nIn the video, one officer, who is surrounded, draws his revolver and points it at the group. He fires and one protester collapses on the street while others flee.\n\n\"Live ammunition has been used as a warning shot before, only once, or potentially twice, but this is the first time that live ammunition has been used on a protest,\" Clarke said.\n\nPolice addressed the shooting and called on rioters to stop \"illegal acts\".\n\n\"A large group of protesters were attacking police officers, despite warnings from the police,\" Yolanda Yu Hoi-Kwan, police senior superintendent, told a press conference.\n\n\"The police officers lives\\ were under serious threat; to save his own life and his colleagues' lives, he [police officer] fired a live shot ... and one 18-year-old man was shot [and] his left shoulder area was injured.\"\n\nStreet clashes\n\nDuring the day, protesters spray-painted slogans aimed at the government, such as \"Topple the Commies\" and \"Communist China, go to hell\", before street battles broke out in several neighbourhoods across the city, including ones near the government office headquarters.\n\nRiot police repelled protesters with rounds of tear gas shells. A smattering of demonstrators hit back with Molotov cocktails, but most huddled behind a patchwork shield of umbrellas in non-violent self-defence.\n\nIn one neighbourhood far from downtown, the police fired at least another round into the air.\n\nOver the past 16 weeks, Hong Kong has been in the throes of anti-government protests - triggered by a proposed bill that would have allowed the extradition of accused individuals to mainland China for trial - that have since morphed into a wider movement for democracy.\n\nDemonstrators are also demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in suppressing the protests, blanket amnesty for all those charged with offences stemming from participating in demonstrations, and a retraction of police claims that protesters are guilty of rioting - a charge that carries a heavy prison sentence.\n\nThe protesters also want to be able to elect Hong Kong's top leader and all its legislators.\n\n'Not feeling Chinese'\n\nA former British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 under a 'one country, two systems' framework, which guaranteed Hong Kong people rights and freedoms largely absent in mainland China.\n\nHowever, in recent years, critics say Beijing has increasingly interfered in the territory and resentments have bubbled to the surface.\n\n191001051410133\n\nIn some neighbourhoods on Tuesday, demonstrators scattered paper offerings meant for the deceased in front of businesses operated by the Chinese government, such as China Travel Services.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the number of Hong Kong people who took pride in being Chinese has gone down significantly, according to a survey conducted in June by the University of Hong Kong's Public Opinion Programme.\n\nThe survey showed a record high number of respondents describing themselves as residents of Hong Kong and a record low of those identifying themselves as Chinese citizens.\n\nAmong those under age 30, the percentage of respondents identifying as Chinese is in the single digit.\n\nAdditional reporting by Violet Law from Hong Kong", "description": "It is the first such injury from a live round in months-long protests against pro-Beijing city administration.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/1/f9a38632e5db49798010fb5328a64192_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
