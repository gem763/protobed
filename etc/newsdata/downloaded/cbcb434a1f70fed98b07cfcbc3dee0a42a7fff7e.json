This isn't correct.\n\n\"There is no need\" is not the same as saying it will not happen.\n\nWhat Juncker was doing was putting pressure on members of Parliament in Westminster to back the deal on Saturday by framing it along the lines of Johnson's deal versus no-deal Brexit. He was doing Johnson a favour.\n\nUltimately, under the terms of piece of UK law called the Benn act, passed by MPs in September, Johnson must ask the EU for Article 50 to be extended if he fails to secure parliamentary approval on Saturday.\n\nWhile the result is set to be close, a rejection of Johnson's deal is most likely outcome.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party, which props up the UK government, refuses to back the agreement.\n\nThis means Johnson will likely need to win the support of around a dozen Labour MPs in order to get a deal over the line. A Financial Times projection published on Thursday suggested just seven Labour MPs would vote for it.\n\nRead more: Johnson's own official government figures shows his Brexit deal will make British people much poorer\n\nThe EU is committed to avoiding a no-deal Brexit due to the damage it would do to member states and in particular Ireland. Politically they are also keen to avoid being blamed for a no-deal scenario should it eventually happen.\n\nSo while some EU leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, will be deeply unhappy about another extension, they remain unlikely to veto one should it be requested.", "description": "Boris Johnson will be legally obliged to ask the EU for an extension to Article 50 if MPs vote down his Brexit deal on Saturday.", "authors": ["Adam Payne", "Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9681dcc4a0a20c428ffb3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
