REUTERS/Evgenia Novozhenina\n\nPavel Ustinov, 23, was sentenced on Monday to three and a half years in jail for dislocating a police officer\u2019s shoulder when he was arrested during an Aug. 3 rally in Moscow. He denied the charges and said he had not even taken part in the protest.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s critics have pointed to the conviction and others like it as examples of how the authorities have handed out harsh sentences to scare off would-be sympathisers from joining the biggest protest movement in the capital for years.\n\nThe authorities deny that and say many of this summer\u2019s opposition protests were illegal because they were not formally authorised and that people were prosecuted for breaking the law.\n\nUstinov\u2019s cause was taken up by celebrities such as TV star Maxim Galkin and popular singer Sergey Lazarev who shared their anger with millions of followers on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThis is simply a monstrous sentence for a young man who wasn\u2019t doing anything! He was just standing by the metro waiting for his friend...\u201d Lazarev wrote to his 4.2 million followers.\n\n\u201cThe (police) hurled themselves at one guy in such an inept group that it\u2019s a wonder they didn\u2019t break anything else of one another,\u201d Galkin told his 6.4 million followers.\n\nThe opposition regularly confronts the authorities over what it considers abuses by the authorities, but it is unusual for those causes to be taken up by celebrities with mass appeal.\n\n\u201cYou can clearly see in the video of his arrest that he didn\u2019t resist the... police,\u201d actor Alexander Pal said on Instagram. \u201cThis is an entirely fabricated case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe monstrous injustice and cynicism that this is done with could concern anyone,\u201d actor Danila Kozlovsky wrote.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s spokesman said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on a court ruling, but that Ustinov could appeal if he chose to do so.\n\nSome Moscow theatres issued calls for him to be freed following performances on Monday evening. Ustinov studied acting and has played minor roles in films.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re convinced of his innocence. Let\u2019s not be dead souls, let\u2019s not be silent about this, let\u2019s talk about this. Let\u2019s support Pavel Ustinov,\u201d a theatre worker told the audience after a performance at the Na Strastnom theatre in Moscow.\n\nPolice arrested more than two thousand people at protests over the summer that flared after more than a dozen opposition candidates were barred from taking part in a local election in Moscow that was held this month.\n\nSeveral were given jail terms of up to three and a half years for assaulting police officers, convictions the opposition says are part of a broader crackdown aimed at stymying its activities.", "description": "Many Russian celebrities took to social media on Tuesday to condemn what they said was the brazenly unjust jailing of a novice actor over an opposition protest and demanded that the authorities release him from prison.", "authors": ["Tom Balmforth", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430841910&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0YX", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
