Ginny Ehrhart, Powder Springs Republican, said her bill would protect children from having irreversible medical procedures done at age when they are uncontroversially categorized as too young to give real consent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about children that can\u2019t get a tattoo or smoke a cigar or a cigarette in the state of Georgia, but can be castrated and get sterilized,\u201d she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nGeorgia currently requires a parent to consent to a minor\u2019s surgery or prescribed medication. Ms. Ehrhart said certain details remained uncertain as she is still drafting a bill, but she said it might also prevent parents from consenting to gender-transition procedures.\n\n\u201cThere may be some implication for the responsibility of the parent to subject the child to this sort of dangerous medical intervention,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill would not bar doctors from working with transgender adults.\n\nCiting a press release from Ms. Ehrhart, the Journal-Constitution reported that the bill would ban \u201cmastectomy, vasectomy, castration and other forms of genital mutilization\u201d for the purpose of changing sexes as well as prescribing \u201cpuberty-blocking drugs to stop or delay normal puberty and cross-sex hormone therapy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe removal of otherwise healthy or non-diseased body parts from minor children would also be prohibited,\u201d the press release said.\n\nJeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, told the AJC that Ms. Ehrhart\u2019s bill is \u201cshameful\u201d and part of a \u201cdangerous trend from the most conservative forces to demonize and strip transgender individuals of their humanity.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
