Rand Paul has backed former Rep. Cynthia Lummis for Wyoming\u2019s open Senate seat. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images elections Bad blood: Rand Paul moves to thwart a Liz Cheney Senate run The Hatfields and McCoys of the GOP are at it again.\n\nRand Paul began his offensive against Liz Cheney as soon as a Senate seat opened up in May, reigniting a years-long feud between their families and warring wings of the Republican Party.\n\nThe Kentucky GOP senator quickly made contact with Cynthia Lummis, a former conservative House member, to encourage her to run for the Senate seat opening up in Wyoming now that Mike Enzi was retiring.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLummis soon jumped into the race, leaving Cheney, her successor in Congress, with a tough choice: Embark on a brutal primary against Lummis or take the safer route and seek her fortune in House leadership.\n\nThat was only the beginning of Paul\u2019s slugfest with Cheney, one that included a fierce back and forth over Twitter on foreign policy, dueling Sunday show appearances and a highly unusual phone call from Paul into a Casper, Wyo., TV station to assert that Wyoming Republicans are \u201ctired\u201d of Cheney\u2019s support for nation-building abroad.\n\nCheney, the No. 3 House Republican in just her second term, responded with her own show of strength. She said she was looking forward to having dinner with President Donald Trump that evening.\n\nThe assertion from Cheney that Paul has surrendered \u201cto terrorists\u201d and Paul\u2019s response that Cheney is a \u201cNeverTrump warmonger\u201d was, in the words of Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), \u201cweird, wild stuff.\u201d\n\nThe bad blood between the Cheneys and Pauls goes way back. The fathers, former Rep. Ron Paul and former Vice President Dick Cheney were on opposite sides of the Iraq War. Dick Cheney backed Rand Paul\u2019s primary opponent in 2010. Since Rand Paul was elected, he\u2019s backed Liz Cheney\u2019s challenger in each of her congressional races.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney has risen quickly in the House, and at times staked out more conservative territory than Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\n\u201cRand likes to pick a fight, that\u2019s his way,\u201d said Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), who serves in House leadership with Cheney but is neutral on the Wyoming Senate race.\n\nBut the battle is much more than personal beef. It\u2019s a preview of a divisive Senate primary; a public display of the long-running effort to influence Trump\u2019s loose policy views; and a test for how best to claim the Trump mantle in a party whose sharp divides have been papered over since winning the White House in 2016.\n\nA safe red state is the perfect place for it all to play out, with Lummis as a proxy for Paul\u2019s libertarian-inflected conservatism against Cheney\u2019s sharp-edged ambition at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cCynthia Lummis is going to be the next U.S. senator from Wyoming. If [Cheney] runs, it may be the most significant Republican primary in the country,\u201d Paul said in an interview. \u201cShe\u2019ll have to decide whether she wants to match conservative credentials with somebody who actually lives in Wyoming and has been there her whole life.\u201d\n\nCheney\u2019s allies scoff at Paul\u2019s early intervention in the race and insist it won't impact her decision making. In fact, they say his aggressive maneuvering could backfire in a state where GOP voters have hugged Trump tightly. Paul, they point out, once called Trump an \"orange-faced windbag\" and has only voted with Trump 69 percent of the time on key votes, compared to Cheney\u2019s 96 percent, according to the website 538.\n\nEarly polling shows Cheney leading Lummis by over 20 points in a potential match-up, according to a survey conducted by the GOP firm The Tarrance Group.\n\nThough she's made no final decision and isn't expected to do so for a couple months, Republicans believe she's likely to run for the Senate, according to interviews with a dozen members of Congress and aides. For now, Cheney says only that she\u2019s \u201cgoing to do what\u2019s best for Wyoming.\u201d And even some of her closest allies don\u2019t know where she will land.\n\n\u201cShe and I have talked about it several times,\u201d said Rep. Bradley Byrne, a Cheney friend who is running for Senate in Alabama. \u201cShe\u2019d be a terrific senator, she\u2019d be a terrific speaker. I think that is the dilemma.\u201d\n\nHer decision will have an outsized effect on both the Senate, where she could one day mount a presidential run, and the House, where she\u2019s viewed as a potential future speaker. Many are already taking sides.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is eager for Cheney to run, according to three sources familiar with his preference in the race. McConnell sees Cheney as a dynamic addition to his conference and a likely ally for his agenda. Lummis was often at odds with House leadership and served in the hard-line House Freedom Caucus.\n\nHawkish Republicans like Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) also back Cheney.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

In addition to Paul, Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) all support Lummis. Plenty of Senate Republicans are also still peeved by Cheney\u2019s aborted primary campaign against Enzi six years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cLiz very well could be the first Republican woman speaker of the House,\u201d Cramer said, adding that the state and party will be stronger without a divisive primary. \u201cIf I was in Wyoming I\u2019d go, \u2018gosh, we have an opportunity to have a couple superstars.\u2019 And if Liz does [run for Senate], we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCheney has risen quickly in the House, and at times staked out more conservative territory than Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) \u2014 moves that could better position herself to run for speaker one day.\n\n\n\nIf Cheney instead decides to challenge Lummis for the Senate, the contest would elevate the larger split in the Republican Party over foreign policy and the still simmering debate over whether Trump\u2019s worldview is closer to Paul\u2019s and Lummis\u2019 or Cheney\u2019s.\n\nLummis told POLITICO she \"received encouragement from Senator Paul and a number of other fiscally conservative senators.\" And despite Cheney\u2019s leadership position, Lummis still has allies in the House, where she served for nearly a decade.\n\nConservative Rep. Mark Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s closest confidants on Capitol Hill, has already contributed to Lummis\u2019 campaign. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who leans libertarian like Paul, said it\u2019s an \u201ceasy call\u201d to back Lummis.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers and aides interpreted the Cheney-Paul Twitter spat as an audition for an audience of one: Trump. If Cheney does jump into the race, there would undoubtedly be a battle for Trump\u2019s endorsement. His supporters in Congress are unsure if Trump would weigh in.\n\nCheney\u2019s allies, though, say she has a leg up, catching Trump\u2019s eye on Fox News as a fierce champion of the military. At a White House event in July, the president heaped praise on Cheney, saying she has a \u201cpretty unlimited future.\u201d\n\nYet Lummis was also considered for Interior secretary, a sign the president has gotten over a disparaging comment she made during the 2016 campaign \u2014 that she was \u201cholding my nose\u201d to vote for Trump.\n\nRegardless of who wins, the Senate will be far different with the departure of the low-key Enzi. Lummis might be a headache for GOP leaders if she resumes the same confrontational stance she had in the House and joins Paul as a thorn in McConnell\u2019s side.\n\nAnd if Cheney wins, well, those who sit between her and Paul at the weekly Republican lunches better look out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody will stab anybody,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), not entirely convincingly.", "description": "The Hatfields and McCoys of the GOP are at it again.", "authors": ["Burgess Everett", "Melanie Zanona"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/70/b388e5ff477584ca6c509cd280cf/19921-rand-paul-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
