Or follow the Obamas' lead?", "language": "en", "text": "Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was confronted at a town hall by a frantic woman \u2014 either lunatic or troll \u2014 hailing from what\u2019s left of the late Lyndon LaRouche\u2019s political cult.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be here for much longer, because of the climate crisis,\" the woman shouted. \"We only have a few months left. I love that you support the Green Deal, but it\u2019s not gonna get rid of fossil fuel. It\u2019s not going to solve the problem fast enough. A Swedish professor said we can eat dead people, but it\u2019s not fast enough! So, I think your next campaign slogan needs to be this: We\u2019ve got to start eating babies.\"\n\nShe even removed her jacket to reveal a T-shirt that said, \u201cSave the planet, Eat the children.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez, recognizing that her interlocutor was either facetious or mentally disturbed, handled the situation about as well as could be expected. Obviously, no one will be taking the Jonathan Swift route to avoid climate disaster any time soon.\n\nBut the outlandish suggestion of eating babies should be enough to make anyone think, especially given the hyperbolic and alarmist rhetoric that surrounds climate change nowadays. Greta Thunberg\u2019s needless anxiety problem serves as a reminder that at some point, irresponsible rhetoric about climate change can cross the line from merely stupid to dangerous \u2014 or at least to a point where it moots any need or desire to act.\n\nScientists broadly agree that the earth\u2019s temperature is warming due to human emissions of greenhouse gases. But that hardly settles climate change as a political issue. This scientific reality does not on its own produce any obvious policy prescription that is both practical and potentially effective in solving the problem: In fact, most proposals, like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal, fail on both counts.\n\nMore importantly, the broad scientific consensus does not by any means extend to the precise timeline, nature, or magnitude of the consequences of that warming. News organizations can generate clicks from scary predictions about how Miami will soon be underwater, but no one knows the day or the hour when it will happen or even with certainty that it ever will. Very rich people who claim to believe in science, including the Obama family, are paying enormous sums of money to live right on the ocean\u2019s edge. Are they climate deniers? Or are they just not hyperventilating?\n\nTo hear Ocasio-Cortez and others discuss the subject, one comes away with a clear impression that the world is beyond hope.\n\n\u201cThe world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change,\u201d she has said. To be fair, she meant to say only that the world will end if we don\u2019t address climate change within 12 years. But with only about 11 years left to act as of this writing, and certainty that the world\u2019s largest emitter (China) will increase its emissions over that period, we would normally conclude that the world is lost \u2014 even if we do start eating babies.\n\nIf this environmental millenarianism is real, then at least it helps puts other things into perspective. Impeachment hardly matters if the world is about to end anyway. No point in going through another wearying, divisive election season .\n\nAnd why save up in your 401(k) when you\u2019ll never get to use the money? Why save for college when the world will be uninhabitable by the time their kids reach adulthood anyway?\n\nThen again, maybe the Obamas are right. Maybe you\u2019re saving and planning for the future and buying houses on Martha\u2019s Vineyard because deep down, you don\u2019t believe in the alarmism, either.", "description": "Recent outlandish suggestions on climate change should be enough to make anyone think, especially given the current alarmist rhetoric that surrounds the topic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa4ff02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2287x1201+0+43/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fc6%2F22%2Fe8a9b09540a0a57412e38c05e083%2Fistock-1149244507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
