It\u2019s still there and you can\u2019t forget it. This mark we have on our face now, when somebody is not doing enough they should look in the mirror and think about that game.\u201d\n\nThe Austrian also said he had held clear-the-air talks with his team in the wake of the Leicester loss and said their main aim in the Cup match against City was avoiding a similar scoreline.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t get worse than last week. It was the main goal that we had,\u201d he said.\n\nHasenhuettl added that Southampton, who are in the relegation zone and face Manchester City again in the league on Saturday, had time to get back on track.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to say sorry for Friday because we have this mark now and I think the time of the season that this happened can be a big chance for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it was at the end and we were struggling in a relegation battle then it would be horrible. At the moment, I think it can help us see things clearer. It means I can see the players I can trust.\u201d", "description": "Southampton's record 9-0 Premier League defeat to Leicester City last week has left a stain on the club but it came early enough in the season to give the players a chance to put things right, manager Ralph Hasenhuettl has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446438703&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0D1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
