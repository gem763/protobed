Asked whether the DVD will contain the entire match, the official said that's likely to be the case.But we still don't know when it will be airedSouth Korea's three major TV networks KBS, MBC and SBS are still negotiating with North Korea about the cost.That's all from me for now.But we will have the latest or hopefully the result of the match on our later newscast.
