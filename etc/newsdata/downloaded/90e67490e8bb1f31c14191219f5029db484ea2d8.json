(AP) - Officials have confirmed a case of mumps at a Florida junior high school.\n\nThe principal of Pioneer Middle School in Broward County sent a letter to parents Friday saying that students displaying symptoms would be excluded from school until a doctor determined they weren\u2019t contagious.\n\nThe letter didn\u2019t say whether the infected person was a student or staff member. The airborne virus is transmitted through the inhalation of infected salvia droplets released during coughing or sneezing or by direct contact with the saliva of an infected person.\n\nSigns and symptoms of mumps include fever, headache, loss of appetite, weakness, earache and swelling in the neck or jaw. The incubation period is from two to three weeks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Officials have confirmed a case of mumps at a Florida junior high school.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
