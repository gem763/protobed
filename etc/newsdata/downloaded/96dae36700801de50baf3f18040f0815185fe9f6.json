To avoid deadlocking, the jurors acquitted Olsen, 57, of felony murder and convicted him on the rest of the charges, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSpeaking anonymously to reporters, one juror said the jury was largely split along racial lines, with most white jurors leaning toward acquittal based on Olsen\u2019s self-defense claim, and most nonwhite jurors supporting a conviction for murder, the AP reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was only so much I could do. I was disturbed,\u201d Juror 31, who is black, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \u201cAt some point in time, just hearing him say self-defense and hearing people in my [jury] saying self-defense was \u2026 one of the hardest things that any man of color could endure.\u201d\n\nThe unusual verdict capped an emotional 20-day trial, where the difficulties of policing mental illness collided with the racial tension accompanying the shooting of an unarmed black man by a white cop. It comes on the heels of the second-degree murder conviction of former Dallas officer Amber Guyger in the shooting death of Botham Jean in his own apartment, and after the acquittal of another Georgia officer, Zechariah Presley, in the shooting death of a fleeing, unarmed black man named Tony Green. On the same day as the verdict in Olsen\u2019s case, a Fort Worth cop was also charged with murder after shooting a black woman, Atatiana Jefferson, in her own home.\n\nIn closing arguments earlier this month, lead DeKalb County prosecutor Pete Johnson urged jurors to refuse to allow a police officer to kill an unarmed, mentally ill man with impunity, saying, \u201cMaybe there was a time it was like that,\u201d but, \u201cnot here. Not today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know in my heart that this community\u2019s conscious does not say it\u2019s okay to just kill a young man because he\u2019s walking toward you,\u201d added prosecutor Lance Cross. \u201cThe conscience of this county will not allow this to stand. It is wrong, and it\u2019s time people say it.\u201d\n\nAt the time of his death, Hill was trying to ask for help, prosecutors said.\n\nAn Afghanistan War veteran, Hill was discharged from the Air Force on medical grounds in 2013 after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. On the afternoon of March 9, 2015, in the middle of a mental health crisis, he stripped off most of his clothes outside his apartment, and began knocking on the leasing office door.\n\nAD\n\nTwo maintenance workers encountered him. Hill told them he needed help, that the devil was coming for him and that he loved his mom He asked at one point, \u201cWhere do I live?\u201d Atlanta magazine reported. The workers tried to escort him home, but Hill came back outside, now entirely naked, doing an military crawl on the playground.\n\nAD\n\nOne maintenance worker told him the police were on the way.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Hill responded. \u201cThe police are my friends.\u201d\n\nThose were his last known words, Cross said.\n\nWhen Olsen arrived and got out of his cruiser, the officer\u2019s gun was already drawn. Defense attorneys argued he was trying to deescalate the situation, flashing his gun to gain control and send a message, rather than intending to use it.\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors argued that was an unbelievable claim, saying Olsen failed to take any other nonlethal steps before deciding to shoot Hill, in a clear violation of the DeKalb County Police Department\u2019s excessive force policy. There was no Taser, or baton, or even an attempt to talk to Hill, who had been described over the police radio as mentally ill and naked.\n\nIn all of six or seven seconds, Hill was dead.\n\nWhen Olsen got out, Hill began jogging toward him, witnesses testified, varying in description of Hill\u2019s speed. Olsen yelled \u201cStop!\u201d twice, and Hill did not stop but slowed to a near-walk, Cross said. Then, Olsen fired.\n\nAD\n\nAt the time he struck and killed Hill, the young man was not even within arm\u2019s reach, about six feet away, Cross said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA naked man doesn\u2019t pose a threat to a trained cop,\u201d Juror 31 told reporters, the Journal-Constitution reported. \u201cWhen we call a cop, we expect a cop to de-escalate a situation, not turn to the most deadliest arsenal on his belt. And that\u2019s where he went wrong.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, Olsen tried to \u201cstretch\u201d the facts to make Hill seem threatening, attempting to justify his decision to shoot him, Cross said. Olsen told the second officer to arrive on scene that Hill attacked him and pounded on his chest. It was a lie, according to witness testimony and bystander video footage.\n\n\u201cOnce you lie, it\u2019s hard to believe anything else,\u201d Juror 31 said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was going off \u2014 the lies and the lies and the lies. It helped me make my decision a lot more quickly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDefense attorneys argued that Olsen was feeling afraid as Hill approached, but prosecutors countered that in all of his interviews with investigators, Olsen never mentioned fear. According to one state investigator who testified, Olsen said he was concerned about having a confrontation \u2014 which Cross said was not a reason to kill someone, given that is the everyday nature of policing.\n\n\u201cThe basic truth never changes. No matter how much they argue, it never changes \u2014 that his first instinct was to shoot. Period,\u201d Cross said. \u201cYou don\u2019t pull a gun out to send a message. That\u2019s got to change.\u201d\n\nAs the verdict in Olsen\u2019s case was read in court Monday, two jurors cried and so did Hill\u2019s mother and Olsen\u2019s wife, who wailed \u201cNo! No! No!\u201d so loudly she was led out of the courtroom, local news reported. Juror 31 said one black female juror broke down in the jury room upon realizing there would be no murder conviction for Olsen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDeKalb County District Attorney Sherry Boston said she was disappointed jurors did not convict Olsen of murder, but was pleased he will be held accountable on charges carrying hefty prison time. He was previously staring down life in prison if convicted of murder but now faces up to 35 years if given maximum punishment on the charges of aggravated assault, making false statements and two counts of violating his oath of office.\n\nOlsen, now out on bond, is set to be sentenced Nov. 1.\n\nAD", "description": "But the former cop, Robert \"Chip\" Olsen, was still convicted of aggravated assault and lying about the shooting.", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/siDyc49QHGXuzDlp10eaJwXaE5g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UAFVOKXAP4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
