I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nPelosi, who does not directly respond to Trump\u2019s tweets often, retweeted Trump with a lengthy remark, peddling her party\u2019s talking points for the inquiry:\n\nEverybody has read your words on the call. The Ukrainian President asks for military aid to fend off the Russian attack, you say \u201cI want you to do us a favor though,\u201d and then you spend the rest of the call asking for bogus investigations to smear your political opponents. https://t.co/vI2eD4T6vK \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) October 29, 2019\n\nTrump authorized the release of the \u201ccomplete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d following the emergence of a complaint from a so-called \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d The president\u2019s mention of a \u201cfavor\u201d was not immediately followed by a discussion of Biden, as Pelosi suggests.\n\n\u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike\u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people\u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the\u00b7whole situation,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe conversation showed no quid pro quo or pressure, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stressed.\n\n\u201cI think you read everything. I think you read text. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA,\u201d he told reporters last month.\n\n\u201cNo, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I \u2014 so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump asked about Ukraine investigating \u2018Crowdstrike\u2019 (an investigation unrelated to Biden). It was Ukraine President Zelenskyy, not President Trump, who first brought up investigations beyond \u2018Crowdstrike,\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) said in a statement following the transcript\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cOnly thereafter did President Trump mention then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s possible illegal interference in a Ukraine prosecutor\u2019s investigation of Biden\u2019s son,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump said Biden \u201cwent around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\u201d during the phone call \u2013 a reference to the former vice president touting his role in the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Bursisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden was making tens of thousands of dollars per month.\n\n\u201cI said, nah, I\u2019m not going to \u2014 or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said\u2014I said, call him,\u201d Biden said during an appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations last year.\n\n\u201cI said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. He got fired,\u201d he bragged.\n\nHouse Democrats are angling to hold a vote on impeachment inquiry procedures on Thursday, although House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) signaled on Tuesday that their plans could hit a snag.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to consider whether or not it\u2019s ready to go on Thursday. I hope that\u2019s the case,\u201d Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe vote itself would \u201cnot authorize the inquiry,\u201d as the Washington Post indicated. Rather, it would \u201censure transparency and provide a clear path forward\u201d on the ongoing inquiry, which Republicans already view as illegitimate.", "description": "Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump of asking \"for bogus investigations to smear\" his \"political opponents.\"", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/pelosi-pointing-sideways-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
