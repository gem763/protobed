Amazon rose nearly 1%.\n\nCredit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju highlighted a number of supportive factors for the sunnier outlook, including e-commerce operating margin expansion, faster-than-expected free cash-flow growth related to its advertising segment and upward bias on Amazon Web Service revenue forecasts (AWS).\n\nAmazon Web Services has been the company\u2019s golden goose for many a quarter, but saw growth slow last quarter as the company offered price concessions to attract larger enterprise clients, who typically sign longer-duration contracts.\n\nIn the second quarter, AWS growth fell to its lowest level since the segment began reporting separate results, up 37% from a year ago, well below the 49% growth from a year earlier.\n\nThe slowdown in AWS revenue growth will likely continue into the third quarter, with Credit Suisse forecasting growth to decelerate to 36% for the quarter, but lead to more sustained growth for the company.\n\nThe cloud segment accounts for just 13% of Amazon\u2019s overall revenue, but about 70% of the company\u2019s overall operating income.\n\n\u201cDespite the short-term dip in operating profit, we fully expect Amazon to grow into the higher OpEx base as unit economics recover,\u201d Credit Suisse said.\n\nThe upgrade comes just a week ahead of Amazon\u2019s quarterly results due Oct. 24. But not everyone on Wall Street shares Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) optimism.\n\nEarlier this week, Jefferies warned investors not to buy Amazon on weakness ahead the earnings report on worries that many are expecting too much from the e-commerce giant.\n\n\"Fourth-quarter consensus operating income may prove to be a stretch\" and this \"could weigh on Amazon shares if guidance once again falls short of street numbers,\u201d Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGM, UAW reach tentative deal to end month-long strike\n\nSale of $29 billion in Brazil government assets hinges on BNDES spat: sources\n\nFTC gets mixed ruling from administrative judge in dental supply fight", "description": "Investing.com \u2013 Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to rack up gains after Credit Suisse (SIX:CSGN) hiked its price target on the company\u2019s stock, betting that its advertising business will boost margins and cash flows at a time when the e-commerce giant's cloud business is expected to continue to slow", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
