Actually, you might not know that, considering the rumor \u2014 which was conceived to tarnish the controversial monarch\u2019s reputation after her 1796 death \u2014 has been repeated as fact as recently as a 2011 episode of The Big Bang Theory.\n\nCatherine the Great, who ruled over all of Russia for more than three decades, was a legendary conqueror and forward-thinking ruler who championed progressive causes we still, unfortunately, debate today (ahem, vaccines). After a life of history-making accomplishments, however, the thing she is best known for in most circles is something she never actually did: die while attempting to have sex with a horse.\n\nThe reason this absurd rumor is the only \u201cfact\u201d most of us can readily recall about the great monarch can be boiled down to one simple word: misogyny. Throughout Catherine the Great\u2019s life and well after her death, the Russian ruler\u2019s reputation was plagued by a series of calculated rumors about her sexual \u201cdeviance\u201d intentionally spread by her political adversaries \u2026 most of whom were \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 men.\n\nIn the wake of HBO\u2019s new miniseries, the aptly if predictably titled Catherine the Great, a flurry of articles and op-eds defending the show\u2019s eponymous monarch have surfaced in an attempt to separate the ruler from the centuries of libel that have long obscured her legacy. But the point isn\u2019t to downplay the monarch\u2019s noted sexual prowess.\n\nWhile historians have long dismissed some of the more absurd rumors that have colored Catherine\u2019s sexual history (i.e., the horse incident), even the most modest records of the ruler\u2019s reign don\u2019t deny the monarch\u2019s thriving sex life. Like most elite rulers of her time, Catherine is known to have taken a number of lovers throughout her life, often handing out political favors and titles to her romantic and sexual partners.\n\nThat said, to paraphrase one of Emma Stone\u2019s great lines from the iconic 2010 teen flick Easy A, the rumors of Catherine the Great\u2019s promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated. Esquire\u2019s recent attempt to sort Catherine-the-Great fact from salacious fiction reported that historians generally estimate Catherine had between 12 and 22 lovers. A 2018 report from History.com favored the more conservative estimate, which equates to an average of fewer than four partners per decade during her adult life. That may well have been a more significant number in the pre-Tinder era, but scarcely anything to blush at from a reigning monarch.\n\nOf course, if you give an angry crowd of thwarted men an inch, they\u2019ll sex-shame you into infamy. This was true before Catherine the Great \u2014 Anne Boleyn was literally sent to her grave thanks to salacious rumors from enemies falsely accusing her of various acts of sexual deviance, prompting her daughter, Elizabeth I, to cautiously brand herself as the Virgin Queen throughout her own rule. And, surprise, it\u2019s still true now. Today, we call it \u201cslut-shaming\u201d (an admittedly controversial term in its own right), but it comes from the same place: a culture that fears the level of power women can wield outside the confines of patriarchal structures dictating \u201cappropriate\u201d female behavior.\n\nThe key to honoring Catherine the Great\u2019s legacy is not to downplay the few factual details we have about her sex life. The monarch\u2019s fearless embrace of sex positivity centuries before it was a thing should well be considered yet another progressive aspect of her trailblazing reign, especially in an HBO costume drama of which the majority of viewers, myself included, would expect a fair amount of bodice ripping. Rather, the key is to remember that Catherine\u2019s historical contributions didn\u2019t end outside the bedroom. That said, girl could get it.", "description": "The new HBO miniseries has refueled a centuries-long discussion about the legendary Catherine the Great and the rumors that have long circled her sex life.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Catherine_the_Great.png?fit=1200%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
