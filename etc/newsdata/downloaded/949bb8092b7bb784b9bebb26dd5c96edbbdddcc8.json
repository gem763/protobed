But just five years before those disastrous shows, London had been a much happier place for the actress and singer. She received standing ovations, was mobbed by fans, and went out in the town with a glitzy new social circle. For the first time in ages, she seemed happy.\n\nLaurie Holloway, who was the musical director of the Michael Parkinson show and the first three series of Strictly Come Dancing, saw the light-hearted and merry side of Garland from close quarters during this period, when he was hired to be her musical director and pianist for nearly six weeks of rehearsals and two sell-out Palladium shows in November 1964.\n\nHolloway, 81, who also went on to write the theme tunes for Blind Date and Game for a Laugh, and who has accompanied leading musicians such as Ella Fitzgerald, Val Doonican and Mel Torm\u00e9, was a jobbing pianist at the time he got the call to work with 42-year-old Garland.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz star was first brought to the UK in 1951 by the powerful talent agent Harold Davison. \u201cMy agent Dick Katz worked for them, and even though I was young, just 25 at the time, they thought I would be a good fit to be Judy Garland\u2019s piano player for one season,\u201d Holloway tells me. \u201cWhen we discussed it, they asked me if I would like to help Judy and her 18-year-old daughter Liza Minnelli prepare for a concert at the London Palladium. So I spent about six weeks with the two of them, although it was mainly with Judy.\u201d", "description": "Judy Garland\u2019s wretched final months in London in 1969, when she was giving chaotic nightclub performances, are explored in the new biopic Judy, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.", "authors": ["Martin Chilton"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/films/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000205932019-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYHaHRqZzVuMJAn8HN8r1s-vYIwTeGY_Xv7pPik3hx50.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
