Best quotes from male feminist celebrities 1/12 Andy Murray 'Have I become a feminist?' Tennis champion Andy Murray questioned in a 2014 column for the sports newspaper L\u2019Equipe in which he defended his female coach, Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo, who had been receiving sexist comments. 'Well, if being a feminist is about fighting so that a woman is treated like a man then yes, I suppose I have.' Getty 2/12 Tom Hardy During a 2015 interview with Interview magazine, actor Tom Hardy spoke about strong female roles in Hollywood. 'I identify with having strong, powerful female influences in my life,' he said. 'Do you think that women are fairly represented in screenplays, film, TV, and theater today? Or do you think there should be better parts for women than just girlfriend and wife or lover? Because I\u2019m bored with that.' Getty Images 3/12 Prince Harry Prince Harry voiced his support for the empowerment of women in a speech at the Chime for Change concert in 2013. 'We know that when women are empowered, they immeasurably improve the lives of everyone around them \u2013 their families, their communities, and their countries,' he said. 'This is not just about women, we need men to recognise the part we play too. Real men treat women with dignity and give them the respect they deserve.' Getty Images 4/12 Will Smith 'When you have a little girl, it's like, how can you teach her that you're in control of her body?' actor Will Smith asked during a discussion about raising his daughter, Willow, in a 2014 interview with Parade. 'If I teach her that I'm in charge of whether or not she can touch her hair, she's going to replace me with some other man when she goes out in the world. She can't cut my hair, but that's her hair. She has got to have command of her body. So when she goes out into the world, she's going out with a command that is hers. She is used to making those decisions herself. We try to keep giving them those decisions until they can hold the full weight of their lives.' Getty Images 5/12 Joseph Gordon-Levitt American actor, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, spoke about his stance as a feminist in a 2014 YouTube video for the Daily Beast. 'What [feminism] means to me is that you don\u2019t let your gender define who you are \u2014 you can be who you want to be, whether you\u2019re a man, a woman, a boy, a girl, whatever,' he noted. Getty Images 6/12 Daniel Craig To celebrate International Women's Day in 2011, actors Daniel Craig and Judi Dench appeared in a two-minute film highlighting the need for gender equality. In the clip, Craig said: 'Women are responsible for two-thirds of the work done worldwide, yet earn only 10 percent of the total income and own one percent of the property\u2026 So, are we equals? Until the answer is yes, we must never stop asking.' 7/12 Andy Samberg 'Since there have been men and women, there have been funny women... f**king idiot-ass men keep saying that women aren't funny,' American comedian Andy Samberg said in a 2013 interview with Glamour magazine, in response to claims that women are not funny. 'It makes me crazy. I find it disgusting and offensive every time.' Getty Images 8/12 Stephen Curry The basketball star famously wrote a personal essay in 2018 for The Player's Tribune calling for gender equality. In the piece, Curry wrote: 'I think it\u2019s important that we all come together to figure out how we can make [equal pay for men and women] possible, as soon as possible. Not just as \"fathers of daughters\", or for those sorts of reasons. And not just on Women\u2019s Equality Day. Every day\u2014that\u2019s when we need to be working to close the pay gap in this country.' Getty Images 9/12 John Legend John Legend discussed his decision to perform at the Chime for Change concert in 2013. 'All men should be feminists,' he stated. 'If men care about women's rights the world will be a better place. We are better off when women are empowered \u2013 it leads to a better society.' Getty Images for Gucci 10/12 Mark Ruffalo Speaking about his mother's illegal abortion as part of the Draw The Line campaign in 2014, the actor said: 'When I heard the story [of my mother's illegal abortion], I was aghast by the lowliness of a society that would make a woman do that.' He added: 'I could not understand its lack of humanity; today is no different. What happened to my mother was a relic of an America that was not free nor equal nor very kind.' Getty Images for Disney 11/12 Seth Meyers In 2012, the Late Night host told ELLE magazine: 'When you work with the sort of really strong women that I work with, the idea that anyone would want to make decisions for them is hard to wrap your head around.' NBCUniversal via Getty Images 12/12 Simon Pegg In 2015, the actor championed feminism in response to an article in The Atlantic which investigated why women are not often considered as funny as men. 'You often hear misogynists bemoaning \"female comedy\" because it deals with specifically female issues that they can\u2019t relate to,' he said. 'That makes sense because misogynists suffer from a severe lack of empathy.' Getty Images for Paramount Pictures 1/12 Andy Murray 'Have I become a feminist?'

We are invariably stronger this way.\u201d\n\nJamil also shared a photograph to her Instagram account featuring herself, Delevingne and actor Kate Hudson, alongside which she wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s nice when girls get together to celebrate other girls.\n\n\u201cBeing honoured at the #girlup awards was humbling and inspiring. Congrats to all the honorees Sunday including @katehudson@caradelevingne\n\nEarlier this year, the former radio presenter and Delevingne were involved in a Twitter debate after Jamil described Lagerfeld as \u201cruthless\u201d and a \u201cmisogynist\u201d just days after his death.\n\nDelevingne defended the fashion designer, asking Jamil to keep her opinions to herself and \u201cstop bashing people for attention\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou are calling him ruthless??? Are you kidding me?\u201d Delevigne, who was close to the designer and frequently models for Chanel, responded.\n\nThe reaction prompted a heated exchange in which Jamil referred to Lagerfeld as a \u201cbad human\u201d for his comments regarding weight and race.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t chalk decades of abusive rhetoric towards minorities as \u2018being human\u2019 or \u2018making mistakes,\u2019\u201d Jamil wrote.\n\n\u201cDoing it once as a joke and then apologising is one thing, doing it again and again in spite of public outcry is a bad human. I\u2019m sorry to speak ill of someone you love.\u201d\n\nThroughout Lagerfeld\u2019s career, he was frequently criticised for his comments on topics ranging from weight to movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp.\n\nIn addition to perpetuating the idea that models should be thin, the designer once said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want your pants pulled about, don\u2019t become a model! Join a nunnery,\u201d regarding victims of sexual harassment.", "description": "Jameela Jamil has confirmed that she and Cara Delevingne have \u201csorted out their differences\u201d.
