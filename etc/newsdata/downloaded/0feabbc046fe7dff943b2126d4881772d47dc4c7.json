Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi. Though he\u2019s relatively unknown outside of Iraq, Saadi\u2019s contributions to fighting terrorism in Iraq have been highly significant in ridding the country of the Islamic State. Suddenly, late last month, Saadi was unceremoniously stripped of his position in the Iraqi Army and transferred to an administrative role in the Ministry of Defense. The demotion of the celebrated general outraged his many supporters and triggered some of the deadliest protests seen in Iraq and the Middle East in recent years.\n\nA tall, slim, and graying figure, Saadi has a commanding presence that appeals to many Iraqis. The three-star general was appointed to lead Iraq\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Service, a highly trained unit dubbed the \u201cGolden Division\u201d for its recognition as Iraq\u2019s elite force. The service, initially created through support from U.S. Special Forces, developed a reputation for being filled with nonsectarian and multiethnic nationalists. The unit has continued to receive training from U.S. forces throughout the war against the Islamic State. Prior to the Mosul offensive in 2017, 300,000 Iraqis applied to join the unit, with only 1,000 making it through the joint U.S.-Iraqi training academy.\n\nThe Golden Division was tasked with being on the front lines throughout the military campaigns in Mosul, fighting under only the Iraqi flag, compared to the mainly Iran-backed Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) frequently fighting under sectarian banners. Such differences resulted in the banning of the PMF by then-Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi from operations in Mosul and Tal Afar. Being visibly on the front lines, ridding Iraq of a hated enemy, resulted in Saadi gaining a cultlike hero status among Iraqis, especially when compared with the politicians occupying Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone, who are widely perceived as corrupt and paralyzed. A statue of Saadi was even erected in Mosul commending his role in its liberation.\n\nThe fact that Saadi and his division frequently received training from coalition forces likely ruffled some feathers among Iraq\u2019s pro-Iranian elite. Unlike the Golden Division, the PMF, under Hadi al-Amiri, received their training from Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Gen. Qassem Suleimani.\n\nThe concerns about Saadi\u2019s close relationship with the U.S. military were exacerbated when Saadi was found to have visited the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Saadi said he \u201chad one visit to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to get a visa to speak about terrorism at Harvard.\u201d It\u2019s a plausible claim, as he had spoken at the university a year earlier on a similar panel. Despite continually risking his life to combat the global threat of terrorism, Saadi, as an Iraqi citizen, is limited to yearlong U.S. visas only and must reapply annually.\n\nThe mounting apprehension of Saadi\u2019s relationship with the United States\u2014and likely pressure from Iran\u2014resulted in the dismissal of Saadi from his position in the Counter-Terrorism Service and his transfer to a desk job. The move could indicate the effective dismantling of the Iraqi Army as the PMF seeks to increase its influence across the nation, possibly by putting forward a pro-Iranian general to replace Saadi. Mindful of Saadi\u2019s military strength, Iraq\u2019s government could have viewed his widespread public approval as a worrying sign of the prospect of a military coup.\n\nProtesting his innocence, Saadi\u2014in an unusual move for military personnel\u2014took to Iraqi satellite media to reject his dismissal. Saadi, describing his treatment by the Iraqi government as an \u201cinsult\u201d and \u201cpunishment,\u201d lost some empathy from supporters as he publicly protested a direct order from Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.\n\nThe cult status of the general, however, meant Saadi\u2019s dismissal resonated among Iraqis, and Iraqi youth responded by taking to the streets and social media to air their disapproval. Numerous social media posts endorsing the general can be found across Iraq\u2019s social media, with messages of support trending across Iraq\u2019s internet. At the protests, many held posters of the ousted Army official.\n\nThe protests have had a markedly strong Shiite presence, with slogans commemorating Shiite religious figures being chanted throughout the streets of Baghdad, indicating a strong resentment toward Iranian interventionism in Iraq by the Shiite community\u2014similar to the sentiments expressed by protesters who attacked the Iranian consulate in Basra last year.\n\nNow, Saudi Arabia is seeking to stoke these tensions. Seeing an opportunity to topple what it perceives as a pro-Iranian Iraqi government, Riyadh has begun to use social media platforms to perpetuate the violent protests in Iraq. Creating bots to target Western media outlets, tweets from pro-Saudi users asking to \u201csave the Iraqi people\u201d and push \u201cIran out\u201d were posted despite an internet blockade in Iraq. Saudi Arabia, which has a long history of using social media influence to crack down on dissidents, is now attempting to spread anti-Iranian sentiment in Iraq.\n\nThe situation is quickly deteriorating, and Iran is not the only target. A diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that rockets were fired into Baghdad\u2019s Green Zone and landed near to the U.S. Embassy during the internet blockade, indicating these protests are against any foreign interventionism in Iraq, be it Iranian, American, or Saudi. These protests have had a strong sense of Iraqi patriotism, with the activists referring to the movement as a \u201ccivilian movement,\u201d suggesting a post-Islamist movement in Iraq growing from the \u201ctraumatic experience of sectarian violence,\u201d as the researcher Zahra Ali put it.\n\nGiven the rising tensions and corruption in Iraq, the relative lull in violence since the collapse of the Islamic State should never have been seen as more than a momentary pause in conflict. Writing for Foreign Policy last year, I predicted that should underlying grievances persist, further outbursts of violence could be expected. Now, the unifying factor of a common evil in the Islamic State no longer exists, and Iraqi patriotism does not continue to extend to include support of the government, deemed to have achieved nothing for the people of Iraq. The root causes of grievances in Iraq have never been addressed; when heavily armed and trained fighters return home to a lack of jobs and housing in a country suffering from widespread corruption, that is a recipe for civil unrest.\n\nSaadi\u2019s cause proved to be the final straw for Iraqis. It provided the outlet for Iraqis to revolt against the ruling elite in their central government. With many countries functioning at a deficit, Iraq\u2019s government budget recorded a surplus between 2018 and 2019 of 8 percent of its GDP. But such economic progress has not translated to improved public services, job opportunities, or security for the majority of Iraqis, as corruption is heavily discernible throughout Iraq\u2019s ruling elite, consigning Iraq to being ranked the world\u2019s 13th most corrupt country.\n\nReforms privatizing many of Iraq\u2019s industries have continued to devastate Iraq\u2019s public sector and have not promoted job opportunities in Iraq, as Iraq\u2019s employment rate dropped to a record low of 28 percent in 2018. One in four of Iraqi children continue to live in poverty, while families struggle to find stability. The abundance of Iraq\u2019s natural resources has failed to support its citizens, producing a lack of electrical infrastructure, access to clean water, and effective health care. In some parts of Iraq, 90 percent of school-aged children are not in the education system.\n\nSimilar to the protests of the Arab Spring, this largely Shiite-led movement lacks any well-defined direction, leadership, or a clear set of demands, leading Abdul Mahdi to refer to the protesters as \u201crioters\u201d and belittle the legitimate grievances of Iraq\u2019s citizens. The fact that members of the powerful Iran-backed PMF, who could potentially instigate a civil war, have not yet become involved suggests that Iran disapproves of the protests and, to its benefit, continues to support the status quo. Protests in Sunni-majority cities in Iraq have yet to come to fruition, as their inhabitants are either living in camps or fear stigmatization as terrorists.\n\nIraq\u2019s government under the premiership of Abdul Mahdi, just short of a year old and heavily influenced by the political wing of the PMF, has responded violently. Applying both curfews and internet blockades, the government\u2019s clampdown has resulted in about 100 deaths and thousands of injuries in the protests.\n\nFurther polarizing the Iraqi protesters, Abdul Mahdi said on Facebook that he vows to \u201cto learn the reasons\u201d behind the protests, despite his government being the source of grievance, as protesters exclaim, \u201cThe people want the collapse of the regime.\u201d Abdul Mahdi\u2019s immediate violent response to the protests, compared with former Prime Minister Abadi\u2019s response to protests, suggests that this government fears the civil unrest could topple its leadership.\n\nFor too long, Iraq has been a playground for regional influence and interests. The protests should remind the government whom it is ultimately accountable to, after having become far too complacent over recent months, basking in the post-Islamic State world of ostensible security.\n\nThe ruling elite have been detached from the harsh realities of everyday life in Iraq. The grievances that paved the way for Iraq\u2019s sectarian violence in 2007, the civil unrest of 2011, the rise of the Islamic State in 2014, and the Basra protests have yet to be addressed. Coupled with rising U.S.-Iranian tensions, the effective dismissal of Gen. Saadi should serve as a reminder that the solution for Iraq is major reform to counter corruption and support public services for an increasingly frustrated population.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ahmed Twaij", "Geneive Abdo", "John Hannah", "Pilar Cebri\u00e1n", "Steven A.
