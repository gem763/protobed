Harmless flirtation from a beautiful harmless scene in a movie. It\u2019s a wonderful song that everyone\u2019s enjoyed and we should continue to enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Radical feminists like you want to suck the joy out of everything and make this look like sexual assault. She gave consent, she stayed. Do you not read the lyrics? She\u2019s flirting with him.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
