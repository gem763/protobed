Is an election happening?", "language": "en", "text": "Have MPs now blocked a no-deal Brexit?\n\nNo \u2013 not least because the backbench-launched bill on no deal could only ever obstruct it as an option, not entirely remove it. But the cross-party plan has passed all stages in the Commons, and will now head to the Lords on Thursday. Boris Johnson has maintained his unenviable 100% vote loss record as prime minister, begun on Tuesday night when MPs voted to take control of the agenda and tackle the bill. It passed the second and third readings in a single afternoon, by 327 to 299 and 329 to 300.\n\nMore than 100,000 apply to register to vote in UK in 48 hours Read more\n\nWas it amended to bring back Theresa May\u2019s plan?\n\nYes \u2013 and in yet another curious and dramatic twist, this happened without most MPs immediately knowing how or why. An amendment led by Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock, which would resurrect May\u2019s three times-rejected Brexit plan as a possible focus for any extension, looked likely to be defeated in a vote. However, the government did not provide any \u201ctellers\u201d, the MPs who count votes, for their side, the noes. That meant it was passed by default. Whether that was an accident or planned was not clear. However, the amendment did not stop the bill passing the third reading, so MPs seemed unbothered.\n\nIs the Lords ready?\n\nYes. After many hours of debate, more than 80 tabled amendments and other delaying tactics by opponents, peers agreed in cross-party talks to return the bill to the Commons by 5pm on Friday. The tortuous process \u2013 which did not end until 1.30am on Thursday \u2013 was not about the bill itself, just clearing the timetable for it to be heard. But with an in-built majority against no deal in the upper house, passing the bill was less of an obstacle.\n\nAre we having a general election or not?\n\nJohnson reacted to Tuesday night\u2019s defeat by promising to call a vote on having an election on 15 October via the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, allowing governments to break the standard five-year period between polls. But under the act, this requires two-thirds or more of MPs to support the measure. Labour and opposition parties mainly abstained. The motion won by 298 votes to 44, nowhere near the 430-plus threshold.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Labour want an election now?\n\nThis was a point made by Johnson at his inaugural prime minister\u2019s questions earlier in the day, calling Jeremy Corbyn \u201cfrightened\u201d. But Labour says it will only back an election when it can be completely sure that Johnson will be unable to force a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. The party is consulting lawyers and other opposition parties, which they say is necessary because they do not trust the PM to keep his word or to follow constitutional norms.\n\nSo when might an election happen?\n\nBoris Johnson fails to bring Tories sunshine in excruciating PMQs | John Crace Read more\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess. Labour is still examining the possible idea of backing Johnson\u2019s 15 October poll in a later vote once the backbench bill has become law, if it is reassured that it can avoid any government ruse to force no deal. This seems to be the preferred SNP option, as well as arguably the one favoured by Corbyn\u2019s team. However, it remains possible that Labour could even then insist on a post-31 October election date.\n\nHow was Johnson\u2019s day otherwise?\n\nNot great, at least in party discipline terms. At a meeting of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, he faced criticism for ejecting from the party the 21 rebels who backed Tuesday night\u2019s vote. Later, the One Nation group of Tory MPs, which includes cabinet minister Amber Rudd and Nicky Morgan, formally wrote to Johnson seeking their reinstatement.", "description": "After another dramatic day in the House of Commons, what happens next?", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Owen Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde4985d67dfec7677b2df180b900907069d0f9b/627_0_1873_1124/master/1873.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6fca33ec9add26e08c4a26dbb136d52e"}
