There are rats coming through our stoves, coming through our toilets. Families are traumatized.\u201d\n\nWhile rat drowning may seem like an unlikely wedge issue in the upcoming mayoral race, the animal rights groups now infuriated with Adams have proved influential before \u2014 helping to sink Christine Quinn\u2019s 2013 mayoral campaign after she opposed banning horse-drawn carriages in the city.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s creating straw man arguments to defend his barbaric practice of drowning animals, and promoting violence towards animals,\u201d said Matt Dominguez, political adviser at Voters for Animal Rights.\n\n\u201cFor him to claim that this is about children versus rats is insane. He\u2019s doing that to justify his bad behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t torture animals, and don\u2019t sadistically carry their bodies out to the press and display them as trophies.\u201d\n\nAdams argues that drowning, while admittedly not pleasant, is a more humane way to kill rats than poison, which leads to a painful death that can take weeks.\n\nThe animal rights groups counter that sterilization in combination with cleaning up the city\u2019s trash problem is the more effective way to rein in the city\u2019s notoriously large rat population.\n\nThe city has tried a range of methods, which also include suffocating rats with dry ice, in a decadeslong but mostly unsuccessful battle against the rat scourge.\n\nPrior to the dead rat incident, Adams had positioned himself as a champion of animal rights \u2014 touting his vegan eating habits, pushing for the city to reduce meat consumption and opposing the gassing of geese in Prospect Park.\n\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I led a march in Prospect Park to stop killing geese,\u201d he said Thursday. He went on to invoke the psychological theory of Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs to argue that concern about being \u201cnice to rats\u201d is a \u201cluxury.\u201d\n\nAnimal advocates were particularly offended because, for the last six months, Adams has been approaching animal protection groups to ask for support for his mayoral campaign, Dominguez said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been two faced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not trust anything that he says anymore.\u201d\n\nEdita Birnkrant, executive director of NYCLASS \u2014 the group that led the charge against horse-drawn carriages \u2014 said the groups are sympathetic to the problems rats cause in neighborhoods, but Adams\u2019 rat trap is not going to make a dent.\n\n\u201cWe just see this as kind of a drop in the bucket, no pun intended,\u201d Birnkrant said. \u201cAs long as we are poorly handling garbage disposal and piling up hundreds of bags of garbage on the street, we\u2019re going to have this problem.\u201d", "description": "\"When you go to the African American and impoverished parts of the city and communities of color, you see a crisis,\u201d he said.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/26/47/82b46b39495d9e63e702bb00d8e1/rat-nyc-ap-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
