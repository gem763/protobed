After tweaking their plans, crews could now begin the operation as early as noon Sunday, officials said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs they got up there and got close to it they found out some things about it that have changed the way they\u2019re going to take it down,\u201d New Orleans Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said in a news conference Saturday. \u201cSafety is the number one concern, and when they tell us it\u2019s too dangerous to do it one way and they want to do it in another way, we\u2019re going with the experts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe cranes were heavily damaged when several floors of the 18-story building came crashing down on Oct. 12. For days, the structures have swayed precariously over the site of the collapse, stirring fears that they could topple in any direction and cause further damage. One crane stands about 270 feet, the other about 300 feet. Both have long boom arms that can be seen extending out over the wreckage of the building.\n\nAfter consulting with demolition experts, city officials on Thursday announced plans to attach explosive charges to the towers. The goal is to detonate them in a precise sequence that will send the structures cascading into the footprint of the building without damaging surrounding streets or other infrastructure in the area, NOLA.com reported.\n\nAD\n\nBut officials cautioned that the cranes might not drop in the clean, controlled manner experts are hoping for. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal, but it might not happen that way,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to McConnell, one of the cranes shifted over the weekend and did not sway back, causing it to rub against the building\u2019s concrete. That likely means it is weakening, he said.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to make sure we\u2019re prepared for whatever happens,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt is a damaged crane. You\u2019re not bringing down something that\u2019s new construction. This thing is being brought down because it\u2019s highly damaged.\u201d\n\nOfficials are planning to evacuate residents in a roughly four-block radius surrounding the site. The city has also established a temporary \u201cexclusion zone\u201d where people must stay indoors and a traffic closure zone extending several blocks farther. Additionally, the city has set up a relocation center across town where displaced residents can ride out the demolition. Workers are going door to door to tell people what they need to do and will give residents four hours\u2019 notice before the explosions begin, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe controlled detonation will be very loud. The best way to protect you & your family is to stay away until the all clear is given from the City,\u201d Mayor LaToya Cantrell (D) tweeted Saturday night.\n\nThe demolition of the cranes \u2014 if it goes according to plans \u2014 is just one step in what is sure to be a long, laborious and expensive response to the deadly collapse.\n\nEmergency workers on Monday removed the body of Anthony Magrette, a construction worker who died when the floors of the 18-story building came crashing down. But in its current state, the mass of steel and concrete is so unstable that crews have been unable to remove the bodies of the two other men killed inside.\n\nSome of the people injured in the collapse on Friday filed a lawsuit against the companies involved in the hotel construction, as ABC News reported. The lawsuit accuses the companies of negligence, saying they used inferior construction materials that were not strong enough to support the weight of the upper floors. It is not clear if the companies have responded to the allegations.\n\nAD", "description": "Officials said the cranes have become dangerously unstable in the days since the collapse.
