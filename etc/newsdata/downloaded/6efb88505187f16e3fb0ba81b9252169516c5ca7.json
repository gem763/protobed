Therefore, traders will scrutinise the statement for any clues and no doubt short AUD if it appears more dovish than August\u2019s statement. Overall, RBA appeared a little more upbeat on the domestic economy and placed greater emphasis on concerns over the trade war. Given tensions have once again risen and the Trump administration have rolled out a fresh round of Tariffs yesterday, we expect these concerns to at least be reiterated, or perhaps even intensified.\n\nGDP data is out on Wednesday, which is another reason to expect RBA to hold off from easing tomorrow. We\u2019ve seen a couple of bold calls for GDP to miss the mark and sink to 1.1% YoY from ANZ, with one analyst calling a -0.6% contraction for the quarter. Even PM Morrison is \u2018expecting soft growth\u2019 on Wednesday which, will likely be a greater market mover than tomorrow\u2019s GDP meeting.\n\nAUD/USD Daily Chart\n\nAs for , we see potential for a technical bounce should tomorrow\u2019s meeting be a non-event, or GDP surprises by not falling below 1.8%. The rationale here is that two prominent spikes to suggests demand is around 0.6677-0.6700 and, despite increased tensions over the trade war, she\u2019s holding up. However, this is no reason to be bullish. Key resistance sits around 0.6832 and we\u2019d see a rally towards this level as an opportunity for bears to fade into.\n\nAUD/USD Volatility Chart\n\nTake note that whilst realised volatility is quite low, 1-week implied volatility is just off a 3-week high to suggest a volatile move could be just around the corner. Given the established bearish trend we expect to break to new lows in due course, but the potential for a correction should not be ignored, given its reluctance to break lower these past two weeks.\n\nS&P/ASX 200 Index Chart\n\nThe ASX200 is trying to breakout but has found resistance around the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level whilst sentiment is under pressure from rump\u2019s latest tariffs. Moreover, volatility has been lower today amid the 3-day weekend I the US, although the index may find the strength to break higher if the RBA meeting is dovish. Technically it looks like the low is in at 6,396, although we\u2019d need to see a notable pickup with global sentiment for stocks to trade to new highs. For now, we think any gains are more likely to be part of a corrective rally and stall below 6,875 before bearish momentum returns.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Forex Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: AUD/USD.
