The series is tied 2-2 and won\u2019t be resolved by Game 5.\n\nTrump\u2019s staff has long tried to shield him from events where he might be loudly booed or heckled, and he rarely ventures into the neighborhoods of the heavily Democratic city. He won just over 4% of the vote in the District of Columbia in 2016.\n\nYet his scheduled appearance - in the stadium, not on the field - would come hours after he announced the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was killed in a U.S. military operation. The successful raid by U.S. troops on a compound in northwest Syria could provide the president a rare moment of bipartisan comity.\n\nMajor League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said he discussed with Trump whether he\u2019d like to throw out the ceremonial first pitch, and the president declined.\n\n\u201cHis view was that in order to make the fan experience as positive as possible, he would arrive at Game 5 sometime after the game began, so that wouldn\u2019t interfere with fans getting into the stadium. Quite frankly, we were very grateful for that,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cHis sole focus was if I do something like a first pitch or arrive in that timeframe, is it going to be disruptive to the everyday fan getting into the ballpark and enjoying the game, and he didn\u2019t want that kind of disruption.\u201d\n\nWashington Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner told the Washington Post that Trump should be at the game, but he made clear that he did not invite Trump to throw out the first pitch.\n\n\u201cThe first pitches are our call, and we felt there are many other candidates that should be considered before (Trump),\u201d Lerner said.\n\nInstead, Jose Andr\u00e9s, a prominent local restaurant owner and humanitarian who has repeatedly opposed Trump\u2019s immigration policies and his administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, was tapped to throw out the first pitch.\n\nFour years ago, Andr\u00e9s withdrew from plans to open a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel in Washington following Trump\u2019s controversial comments about Mexican immigrants during the presidential campaign.\n\nThe business entity Trump Old Post Office, which runs the hotel as the landlord under a lease with the General Services Administration, sued Andr\u00e9s\u2019 companies, Think Food Group and Topo Atrio, in July 2015 for breach of contract and claimed damages in excess of $10 million.\n\nAndres later filed a counterclaim, and the case in D.C. Superior Court was settled in 2017.\n\n___\n\nFollow Aamer Madhani on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AamerISmad\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "President Donald Trump's plan for a low-profile appearance at Game 5 of the World Series comes at a high-profile moment of his presidency.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Aamer Madhani"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/27/world_series_astros_nationals_baseball_80334_c0-213-5112-3195_s1200x700.jpg?2885c220f5db6faa6268596fdf284b124a33d67d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
