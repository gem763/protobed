Vance did, however, interview Cohen at Otisville prison last month.\n\nCohen is serving a three-year sentence at the jail about 70 miles northwest of New York City.\n\nThe sentence began in May, months after he plead guilty to multiple crimes, including campaign finance violations related to carrying out hush-money payments to two women \u2013 adult entertainer Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2013 who alleged they had affairs with Trump a decade ago.\n\nCohen is expected to share everything he knows about Trump after spending more than a decade as his attorney and fixer.
