In this case we did scan for a microchip when the pet arrived at our depot but unfortunately our equipment did not pick the tag up.\n\n\u201cHowever, the pet was logged and tagged as per our normal procedures, meaning we were able to quickly establish it was with us when we were contacted by the owner. There was an issue over the location of the microchip scanner on the day the pet was collected by the family.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The majority of people who we reunite with their pets are thankful we have collected them so they can retrieve their pet and pay their last respects.\n\n\u201cIndeed, this is the first complaint we have received since the current system was introduced a number of years ago.\u201d", "description": "A woman has complained after her dead cat was returned to her by\u00a0a council worker\u00a0\"swinging it\" in a black bin bag.\u00a0 Patricia Preston was on holiday when a neighbour called her telling her an animal resembling her pet Fred\u00a0had been run over by a car and killed near their home\u00a0Gravesend, Kent.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/11/black-cat.jpg"}
