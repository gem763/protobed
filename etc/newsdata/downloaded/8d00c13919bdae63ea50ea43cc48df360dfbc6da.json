The likes of Amazon Web Services is a highly profitable business, and that feeds in a great deal of capital and investment that it can put into other elements of its business, or indeed run services at a margin that other competitors can't.\"", "description": "Amazon is dropping its grocery delivery fees for US Prime customers in a move that is likely to tighten its grip on online shopping and steal more market share from supermarkets.", "authors": ["Hannah Boland", "Hannah Betts", "Tom Hoggins", "James Titcomb"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2016/05/04/appannie2015-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZgEkZX3M936N5BQK4Va8RQJ6Ra64K3tAxfZq0dvIBJw.JPG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
