Not only was it to be the longest period of suspension for many decades, it came at a time when the clock was ticking toward the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline.\n\nAnd yet Tuesday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that the British prime minister\u2019s suspension was unlawful is also controversial; it too broke with precedent and will have far-reaching implications. In taking the court into uncharted waters (even if it was in the name of defending parliamentary sovereignty), the court risks being seen as having set a precedent in favor of judicial interference in the business of government.\n\nQuicktakeConstitutional Crisis\n\nThis was the first time that a decision by the monarch advised directly by the prime minister has been found to be \u201cjusticiable\u201d \u2014 that is, a matter for the courts. Perhaps the closest Britain got to something of this sort was the decision of Home Secretary Michael Howard, in 1994, not to advise Queen Elizabeth II to posthumously pardon Derek Bentley, who was hung for the murder of a policeman in 1953 in a case whose controversy persisted for decades. While pardoning is a prerogative of government, the Bentley case involved a quasi-judicial decision.\n\nIn its recent ruling on prorogation, which was overturned by the Supreme Court decision, the English High Court distinguished between cases concerning \u201cparticular individuals\u201d (such as Bentley) and those concerning \u201chigh politics\u201d \u2014 wider political issues where the courts should not intrude. Citing one of the country\u2019s great jurists and a member of the House of Lords, Thomas Bingham, the court noted that he had ruled that the more political the question, \u201cthe more appropriate it will be a for a political [rather than a] judicial decision.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court, on the other hand, went where the High Court refused to tread. Its reasoning began with a 17th Century ruling that the King could not suspend legislation by his \u201cproclamation\u201d \u2014 which the Supreme Court used to illustrate the power of the courts to restrict political decisions. The Court (which also cited Lord Bingham in its decision) drew attention to the fact that it was being asked to protect Parliament\u2019s ability to legislate and hold the government to account; and it later rejected the argument that it was prevented from deciding the case under Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, which protects the \u201cprivilege\u201d of parliamentary proceedings from scrutiny by the courts, because prorogation was an act by the Crown suspending Parliament, not proceedings within it.\n\nThe Supreme Court also relied on cases where the Crown was prevented from \u201cfrustrating\u201d the purpose of an Act of Parliament, including the 2017 Supreme Court decision, also brought by the activist Gina Miller who challenged the prorogation, in which the court ruled that Parliament must have a say in leaving the European Union in order to comply with the 1973 European Communities Act (by which the U.K. joined the then European Economic Community, the precursor to the EU).\n\nThe Supreme Court gave little consideration to the High Court\u2019s argument that these previous decisions largely concerned preventing the Crown from effectively overriding legislation \u2013 not curtailing the ability of Parliament to meet. Nor did the court deal with the High Court\u2019s warning that it was not equipped to adjudicate where political decisions were concerned.\n\nPolitical decisions of wide consequence involve varied considerations of policy and principle that are the field of a democratically elected government, not the courts. Moreover, that government only remains while it retains the confidence of the House of Commons (which the House could have withdrawn in September); and can be replaced by an election (which the House was asked to authorize but refused to permit).\n\nThe decision will be controversial in other ways too. The judges, whose ruling was unanimous, did not restrict themselves to saying that the courts could judge only the effect of prorogation. Rather, they found that if the effect appeared to \u201cfrustrate or prevent Parliament\u2019s ability to perform its legislative functions and its supervision of the executive\u201d the courts must then consider the explanation the prime minister gives for his advice to the Queen. The reasoning behind a decision to prorogue is inevitably highly political; while the court said it would have to consider such justification \u201cwith sensitivity\u201d it gave no indication of how such an inherently political decision should be scrutinized in the future, only that Johnson\u2019s failed to meet the test of reasonableness.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It was no great surprise that the decision by Boris Johnson on Aug. 28 to prorogue, or suspend, the U.K.\u2019s parliament for five weeks ended up in court.
