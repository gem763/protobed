His parents Charlotte and Tim Dunn, above, now face the nightmare of life without their son and the possibility that the person responsible will never face justice after claiming diplomatic immunity\n\nDespite his relative youth, he was a very experienced rider, but had no chance when he rounded a bend and was confronted with a car driver on the wrong side of the road.\n\nIn the horrific crash that ensued, Harry suffered terrible injuries and died in hospital.\n\nThe sequence of events is not in doubt \u2013 British police say they have studied CCTV evidence that confirm what happened.\n\nBut what IS in doubt is whether the car driver who allegedly caused this accident will ever be held to account for it.\n\nThe crash occurred a few hundred yards from a Royal Air Force base controlled by the US Air Force, and the driver of the car was a woman named Anne Sacoolas, the American wife of a U.S. diplomat.\n\nAnne Sacoolas, above, the American wife of a U.S. diplomat, has skipped the UK and returned to America - allegedly at the advice of the US embassy - rather than face responsibility for the accident she caused\n\nPolice believe she pulled out of the base where her husband Jonathan works \u2013 it is believed he is in fact a spy - drove on the wrong side of the road, and hit Harry Dunn on his motorbike.\n\nBut after initially signalling that she would co-operate in the investigation, Ms Sacoolas suddenly disappeared.\n\nIt turned out she flew back to the U.S. after claiming diplomatic immunity, reportedly on the advice of the U.S. Embassy.\n\nUnder the 1961 Vienna Convention, diplomats and their family members are typically immune from prosecution in their host country.\n\nSo, Ms Sacoolas has exercised her right under this agreement to flee Britain, and justice, and has done so with the full backing of the United States authorities that have so far resisted calls from British police to waive her immunity, as they are empowered to do in exceptional circumstances.\n\nThis means that Harry Dunn\u2019s parents, already suffering the unimaginable agony of losing their son, are now facing a second horror \u2013 the likelihood that the person who caused their pain may never face any accountability for their actions.\n\nIt\u2019s a scandal that shames America.\n\nAs British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said today: \u2018I do not think it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this kind of purpose. I hope that Anne Sacoolas will come back and will engage properly with the processes of laws as they are carried out in this country.\u2019\n\nThe UK's Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke out today to encourage Ms Sacoolas to return to Britain and face the legal consequences\n\nHarry\u2019s family were understandably more emotive in their condemnation.\n\n\u2018We are utterly shocked and appalled that somebody is allowed to just get on a plane and go home and avoid our justice system,\u2019 said his mother Charlotte.\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t let our son die and nothing be answered for,\u2019 said Tim Dunn.\n\nNo, they can\u2019t.\n\nAnd nor should they.\n\nDiplomatic immunity has always struck me as an anachronistic nonsense. If you break the law in another country, whoever you are, then you should face justice by the laws of that country.\n\nWhy should the wife of a diplomat be able to allegedly crash into a young motorcyclist, causing his death, and get away with it?\n\nNobody is suggesting that Anne Sacoolas, 42, deliberately drove on the wrong side of the road, or intended to kill Harry Dunn.\n\nIn all probability she temporarily forgot she wasn\u2019t in America, where cars drive on the opposite side of the road (right, not left) to Britain.\n\nIf that is the case then there would, I\u2019m sure, be some sympathy for her. I\u2019ve inadvertently driven on the wrong side of the road in America several times, thankfully only for a few seconds, and never to such catastrophic effect. It\u2019s usually happened when I\u2019ve first got back to the U.S. after months driving in Britain.\n\nBut we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what happened here because Ms Sacoolas has vanished before she could even be interviewed about the incident.\n\nAnd that dreadful act of moral cowardice has eroded any semblance of sympathy I might have ever had for her.\n\nThis is a woman who has children of her own - one of them was in the back of her car when this crash took place.\n\nThey attend a fee-paying school, Winchester House, where coincidentally, Tim Dunn worked as a caretaker.\n\nMs Sacoolas' own children attend a fee-paying school, Winchester House, above, where coincidentally, the father of the boy she killed worked as a caretaker\n\nHow would SHE feel if someone had killed one of HER kids in such a situation?\n\nHow would Americans feel if this was a British diplomat\u2019s wife in the U.S. who killed a young American boy and then hopped on a plane back to Britain to avoid justice?\n\nAnd how would President Trump react if he heard that news?\n\nI think we all know the answers to those three questions.\n\nThere would rightly be outrage over it, just as there is in Britain right now.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I now urge President Trump to reverse this terrible decision and waive Ms Sacoolas\u2019 immunity.\n\nHe should compel her to return to Britain, co-operate fully with the police, and suffer whatever legal consequences her actions merit after the investigation is completed.\n\nOtherwise, what\u2019s the point of our two countries much-vaunted \u2018Special Relationship\u2019 if someone can allegedly kill a teenager and escape any form of justice in this way?\n\nIt\u2019s not just a matter of justice, either.\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of honor, and giving the poor grieving Dunn family some closure on their awful ordeal.\n\n\u2018My son was take from us at such a tender age doing what he loved doing the most in life\u2019 said Tim Dunn. \u2018We call on the driver and the American authorities to have her come back to the UK to face the legal consequences of her dangerous driving that night. It is no one\u2019s interests for her not to do so, and would set a terrible precedent if she does not return.\u2019\n\nThe parents of Harry Dunn appealed to Donald Trump to intervene\n\nCharlotte Dunn added: \u2018I bear the other driver no ill will. She must be suffering too given what she did. We are not out to get her put behind bars. If that\u2019s what the justice system ends up, doing then we can\u2019t stop that but we\u2019re not out to do that, we\u2019re out to try and get some peace for ourselves. President Trump, please listen. We are a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve. Please, please let her get back on a plane.\u2019\n\nWhat tremendous dignity the Dunns have shown, in the face of such tremendous suffering.\n\nAnd what marked contrast to sniveling Anne Sacoolas secretly scuttling off back home to avoid being made to answer for her actions.\n\nShame on her for doing that.\n\nShame on the U.S. authorities for allowing her to do that.\n\nAnd shame on President Trump if he doesn\u2019t now do the right thing, and send her back.", "description": "The wife of a US diplomat ran over and killed a 19-year-old boy while driving the wrong way down a road.
