At the start of the season we played confidence and resilience away from home, which you need,\u201d Howe said.\n\n\u201cMentally we have been very strong, now we need to hopefully improve the areas where we feel we can tweak and get better at.\n\n\u201cIf we can do that while keeping the mentality, then we have got a chance.\n\n\u201cWe have got a chance in every Premier League game if the best \u2018us\u2019 turns up \u2013 and we have to make sure we do that on Sunday. \u201d\n\nThe Emirates Stadium, though, has not proven a happy hunting ground.\n\nLast season, Arsenal raced into a 2-0 lead, eventually running out 5-1 winners.\n\nHowe feels establishing a foothold in the game will be crucial.\n\n\u201cIf we can learn from those previous games and show better resilience earlier in the game, we will give ourselves a chance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHowever, we will have to perform at our maximum levels to get something.\u201d", "description": "The Cherries are unbeaten in three Premier League games.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/13/wire-19331732-1570277011-978_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
