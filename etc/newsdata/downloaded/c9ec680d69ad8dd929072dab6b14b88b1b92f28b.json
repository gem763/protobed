The industrial action also affected schools, museums and social services. There were strikes nationwide, with Alitalia cancelling 240 flights, but Rome was the hardest hit.\n\nRaggi, Rome\u2019s first female mayor, mocked the strikers as a \u201cminority of trade unionists who are trying to hold hostage a city of 3 million residents\u201d. She tweeted: \u201cThey are workers, mothers and fathers who take their children to school every day, students and commuters. Most citizens are tired of unjustified strikes.\u201d\n\nBut Rome\u2019s citizens, who are planning what has been described as a \u201cpassive march\u201d against Raggi\u2019s administration on Saturday, are also tired of the shoddy state of the city, from the overflowing bins, pot-holed streets and monuments scarred with graffiti, to the unkempt parks and increasingly dysfunctional transport system. More than 20 buses have caught fire since the beginning of the year due to poor maintenance.\n\n\u201cRome has got much worse in recent years,\u201d said Daniela Lucadelli, who was born in the city. \u201cThere\u2019s rubbish on the streets, which attracts rats and wild boar \u2026 this is the capital of Italy, as well as an open museum, it needs to have money invested in it and to be treated with respect.\u201d\n\n'Rome says enough': thousands rally to denounce city's decaying state Read more\n\nGiorgio Robustelli, a member of the Filcams CGIL labour union, said: \u201cI\u2019ve come to protest the degradation of Rome \u2026 the city has more difficulties than it used to.\u201d\n\nRaggi often blames the city\u2019s ills on the decades of inefficiency and corruption that engulfed previous administrations. By the time she took office, Rome was saddled with \u20ac13bn (\u00a311bn) of debt.\n\nRaggi, who was cleared by a Rome court last November of allegations of cronyism and abuse of power, has resisted calls to resign. But with rival political parties organising petitions to get her to quit before the next mayoral elections in 2021, her future is uncertain .\n\n\u201cThe mayor has offended people with her arrogant words,\u201d said Bruno Astorre, the secretary of the Democratic party in the Lazio region. \u201cStriking is an absolute right. Rome is blocked today because of Raggi\u2019s bad governance, not because of exasperated workers.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s march along the River Tiber comes a year after thousands of residents protested outside the local authority to decry the city\u2019s scruffy condition, attracting headlines across the world. Raggi dismissed the protesters as \u201cpeople from the Democratic party with designer handbags and poodles\u201d.", "description": "Mayor Virginia Raggi accuses trade unions of holding city hostage as public services are paralysed", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb6914debeec4f808a9aae10eeec43157b94c6a6/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=138acee1c7d5862821f7a160760650e2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
