By selling your higher valued home and moving into a smaller, cheaper space, you can use leftover dollars for retirement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen that trend here in Miami where people are downsizing,\u201d said Sachs. \u201cGetting out of that big 4,000-square-foot house to a condo half that size. Sometimes the costs go down dramatically.\u201d\n\nFlorida, Miami: Some affluent retirees tap illiquid capital by trading in their houses for condos instead.

If your income exceeds $137,000 according to the IRS you can\u2019t contribute. Likewise if you\u2019re married and your income exceeds $203,000.\n\nBut a higher earner can still contribute to a traditional IRA and convert some or all of those funds into a Roth IRA, Sachs said.\n\nIn general, the advantages of a conversion include tax-free withdrawals in retirement and a tax-free inheritance. There also are no mandatory requirements to withdraw money at a certain age.\n\nWhile there\u2019s flexibility, you should remain mindful of the risks. For instance, the amount you convert adds to your taxable income in the year of the conversion. You also can\u2019t withdraw funds penalty-free until five years after the conversion.\n\n\n\n\n\nA retirement advisor talking to two women at a financial planning clinic at Hyatt Regency Hotel.
