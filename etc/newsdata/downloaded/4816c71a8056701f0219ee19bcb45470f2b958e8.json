It has long been claimed that Nowak was wearing an adult diaper for her frenzied ride, but her lawyers denied it and the diaper was ultimately left out of the film. However, according to Portman, people are really mad about that.\n\n\u201cThe original story was that this woman drove across country to kind of confront or kidnap \u2014 depending on the version \u2014 her boyfriend and his new girlfriend,\u201d Portman said on Friday\u2019s Ellen DeGeneres Show. \u201cAnd she wore a diaper so that she didn\u2019t have to stop on the way.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWe didn\u2019t do that in the movie and everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Where\u2019s the diaper?!\u2019 Everyone\u2019s really upset to not see me in a diaper.\u201d\n\nPortman, clearly weirded out by the whole thing, added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres suggested that she just lie and say that she had it on, because it\u2019s a hard thing to dispute. Portman agreed, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s a good line,\u201d before quipping, \u201cI\u2019m wearing one right now.\u201d\n\nView photos Natalie Portman attends the Premiere of Lucy In The Sky on Sept. 25.

For instance, \u201cI\u2019m Boycotting Natalie Portman\u2019s Diaperless Astronaut Diaper Movie\u201d from Slate, and Vanity Fair\u2019s \u201cNatalie Portman\u2019s Movie About the Diaper-Wearing Astronaut Has No Diapers.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Hollywood Reporter at Wednesday\u2019s premiere, the film\u2019s director Noah Hawley said, \u201cI found it interesting that response, people who said, 'There's no diaper and I'm not OK with that.\u2019 I thought it said more about them really; what is it that makes you want that detail, that makes you want to reduce her to a punch line again? The goal of the film is to re-humanize her and to build empathy for her, to show you that she had an emotional and existential crisis and that's part of becoming an adult.\"\n\nHawley went on to say that he felt Nowak has already paid her price, losing her job after NASA fired her from the program.\n\n\"At the end of the day, her punishment was she lost the thing she cared about the most,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don't need to also punish her by humiliating her.\"\n\nJon Hamm, who plays an astronaut opposite Portman, as well as an extramarital lover, agreed.\n\n\"We're not interested in humorizing this very real and human experience. We're more interested in making it about the philosophical questions behind it and the emotional questions behind it,\u201d he told THR.\n\nDuring Portman\u2019s interview with DeGeneres, she also talked briefly about playing Lady Thor in Thor: Love and Thunder. Because it was just announced and there were no firsts looks of her in costume, DeGeneres made one of her own showing Portman with a Chris Hemsworth-as-Thor makeover.\n\nView photos Ellen DeGeneres jokes about what Natalie Portman's Lady Thor character will look like.
