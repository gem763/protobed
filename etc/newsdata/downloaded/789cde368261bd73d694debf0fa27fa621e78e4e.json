August 20, 2019. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\nUpdated 3:13pm\n\nPresident Trump launched a particularly venomous attack at \u201cNever Trumper Republicans\u201d Wednesday afternoon, calling them \u201chuman scum\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d for the country.\n\n\u201cThe Never Trumper Republicans, though on respirators with not many left, are in certain ways worse and more dangerous for our Country than the Do Nothing Democrats. Watch out for them, they are human scum!\u201d the president wrote on Twitter just before he flew to Pittsburgh for a speech.\n\nTrump\u2019s remark comes a day after acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified before Congress. During his testimony, Taylor confirmed that he was aware of an effort by the Trump administration to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine unless Ukrainian officials agreed to state publicly that they would investigate the business dealings of Trump\u2019s 2020 opponent Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTaylor is represented by \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican lawyer John Bellinger, who vocally opposed Trump\u2019s candidacy in 2016 and has called Trump \u201cmost reckless president in American history.\u201d Bellinger also drafted a letter in August 2016 that was signed by 50 prominent Republican national security officials, including former top aides and cabinet members for President George W. Bush, who said they would not be voting for Trump.\n\nTrump mentioned Bellinger by name in several later tweets and added that he does not want \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d working in his administration.\n\n\u201cNever Trumper Republican John Bellinger, represents Never Trumper Diplomat Bill Taylor (who I don\u2019t know), in testimony before Congress! Do Nothing Democrats allow Republicans Zero Representation, Zero due process, and Zero Transparency\u201d Trump wrote.\u201dIt would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats. Nothing good will ever come from them!\n\n\u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nTaylor also reportedly threatened to resign if a \u201cnightmare scenario\u201d occurred in which Trump continued to withhold military aid even after coercing Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nTrump complained earlier this week about \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d and urged Republicans to push back harder against House Democrats\u2019 formal impeachment inquiry against him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, many of these people were put there during Obama, during Clinton, during the Never Trump or Bush era,\u201d Trump said Monday during a Cabinet meeting. \u201cYou know, you had a Never Trump or Bush. You have heard of those? Those people might be worse than the Democrats \u2014 the Never Trumpers. The good news is they\u2019re dying off fast.\u201d", "description": "Trump complained earlier this week about \"Never Trumpers\" and urged Republicans to push back harder against House Democrats' formal impeachment inquiry against him.", "authors": ["Mairead Mcardle", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
