Jeff Wickersham with Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife Police.\n\nHe added that the family did the right thing in not running away and standing still.\n\n'They didn\u2019t try to approach the animal. When the bear walked up to the one hiker and got right at their feet, there\u2019s not much you can do at that range and that proximity. You know, in that circumstance \u2013 you could have done many things. But I don\u2019t think they did anything wrong,' he said.\n\nHe advised that when confronted by a bear in the wild, hikers should try to make themselves appear bigger than they are.", "description": "Jasmine Bartley was hiking with her family at Mount Rainier National Park in Washington on Sunday when a bear appeared and marched inches away from her brother.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19542286-0-image-a-9_1570716446188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
