Tennis is more than Grand Slams. I need to think about the rest of the things. \u201cI play to be happy. Of course, the victory of today makes me super happy.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

At 33, Nadal may have the edge on Federer, the 38-year-old Swiss crashing out of the U.S. Open in the quarter-finals and failing to add to his Grand Slam titles since winning the 2018 Australian Open.\n\nIf nowhere else, Nadal will be a hot favourite at the French Open, where he has won a record 12 titles including the last three.\n\nHe said that while he was honoured to be part of the battle to be crowned the greatest of all time, and thrilled if it attracted more fans to the game, he would still sleep well if he comes up short.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be all day looking next to you about if one having more or one having little bit less because you will be frustrated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll the things that I achieved in my career are much more than what I ever thought and what I ever dream.\n\n\u201cI would love to be the one who have more. But I really believe that I will not be happier or less happy if that happens or not happen.\n\n\u201cWhat gives you the happiness is the personal satisfaction that you gave your best. In that way I am very, very calm, very pleased with myself.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "Rafael Nadal moved within one Grand Slam title of tying Roger Federer\u2019s all-time mark of 20\u00a0but even after adding a fourth US\u00a0Open to his collection the Spaniard said it was his love of the game, not records, that motivates him.
