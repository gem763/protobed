But it also suggests that Republicans may be more comfortable fighting on process grounds rather than substance, given they don't know what might emerge next.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who has said he wants to get to the bottom of what happened with Ukraine, also complained that he\u2019s been unable to read the transcripts.\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) even took a reporter\u2019s copy of Taylor\u2019s opening statement and questioned why the House committees hadn\u2019t circulated it themselves.\n\n\u201cHow did you get this? Are the committees releasing it? I mean, even the opening statement? Do you think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d she asked. \u201cYou guys are trying to report, you\u2019re trying to tell me what was said. But you don\u2019t have it firsthand you don\u2019t have it firsthand, so how do we know what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\nMurkowski has expressed discomfort with the prospect of tying aid to an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden and is not exactly the closest of allies with the president.\n\nStaunch Trump backers were even harsher toward Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is a one side show trial, don\u2019t they do that in Russia?\u201d said Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). \u201cHow could anybody be concerned about it until they hear the counter?\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/49/9f/26c210a6488d9bc319adaf44db50/191023-john-thune-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
