Their anguish at US abandoning the Kurds has found an outlet in numerous media platforms.\n\nIt reflects poorly on US media that rarely does one comes journalists who point out that this outcome was a foregone conclusion.\n\nIf journalists don\u2019t fare well, the many US generals who complain about US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision are no better.\n\nAfter almost three decades of close involvement in West Asian affairs, US experts seem clueless.\n\nLet\u2019s put the current issue in perspective. Turkey is a NATO member and a US ally. For around three decades, this US ally has been battling a Kurdish separatist movement. The Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (P.K.K), the separatist group in Turkey, is regarded as a terrorist group by US.\n\nAcross the border in Syria, Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (Y.P.G), the ally abandoned by US, has a close connection to P.K.K.\n\nThe US, therefore, has as allies two implacable foes.\n\nWhat could the possible outcome be in this situation?\n\nPrecisely what happened this week. This shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise. More than a year ago, The New York Times carried a report which pointed out that the current situation is a likely scenario. This is why the hand wringing makes no sense.\n\nThe US had to choose to withdraw at some stage or engage in the thankless task of trying to reconcile differences in West Asia. The choice has been made. Right or wrong, it was always a possibility.", "description": "As the Turkish defence forces intensify their attacks on Kurdish fighters in Syria, hand wringing has begun among former US security personnel.
