I will win but it will take a ton of time. Don\u2019t f*** with our timing. We give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul claimed that there was \u2018no way\u2019 Netflix would roll out the feature.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY Netflix will move forward with this.\n\n\u201cThat would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else\u2019s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that. Am I right Netflix?\u201d\n\nAs it stands, Netflix is only testing the feature, and has \u2018no plans\u2019 to roll it out to users.\n\nMs Robinson added: \u201cWhether we introduce these features for everyone at some point will depend on the feedback we receive.\u201d", "description": "The feature gives people the ability to vary the speed at which they watch Netflix content on phones or tablets", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Bloomberg", "Netflix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10998171.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/15_Netflix-Illustrations-Ahead-Of-Earnings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
