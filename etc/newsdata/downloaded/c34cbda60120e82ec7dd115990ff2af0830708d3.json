You probably heard around then that this wasn\u2019t the first abdication, and that Celestine V had abdicated about 800 years earlier. And then we promptly forgot about all of that when Pope Francis was elected. Because, Francis.\n\nThings could have gone very differently.\n\nWhen Celestine V abdicated in 1294 he was succeeded by Pope Boniface VIII. Celestine was an 85-year old hermit from Naples. He was originally selected because of his great piety but he was, as Eamon Duffy has written, \u201csaintly but hopeless.\u201d Some thought that electing an \u201cangelic Pope\u201d like Celestine would help free the papacy of corruption. But it was not to be: Celestine was badgered into resigning by his successor. A more savvy diplomat, Boniface\u2019s first move as Pope was to secure his position by having Celestine imprisoned in the Castle of Fumone. Celestine endured 10 miserable months of mistreatment there before finally kicking the bucket.", "description": "Forget about the Borgias, this pope used the papal armies to massacre his family\u2019s enemies, engage in incestuous threesomes, and question Mary\u2019s virginity.", "authors": ["Candida Moss"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1778,w_3162,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492113159/articles/2016/05/22/was-this-the-worst-pope-in-history/160521-moss-worst-pope-tease_nmhhmc", "published_at": "2016-05-22"}
