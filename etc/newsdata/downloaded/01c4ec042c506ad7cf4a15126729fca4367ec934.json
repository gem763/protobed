The effigy has her face and even her braids. Other actions will follow,\u201d the group announced on social media along with an accompanying photo of the effigy.\n\nFollowing the posting, Rome police initiated an investigation into the act, classifying the social media post as an \u201caggravated threat.\u201d\n\nItaly\u2019s environmental minister, Sergio Costa, called the action \u201ccriminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effigy found hung under a Rome bridge offends and wrongs Greta Thunberg. Each of us, every citizen committed to the climate and the planet, and not only, should feel struck. This is an unacceptable and criminal act, which will find us all the more united in our position,\u201d he posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cShameful the mannequin of Greta Thunberg found hanging on a bridge in our city,\u201d tweeted Rome\u2019s mayor, Virginia Raggi. \u201cMy solidarity and that of all Rome to her and her family. Our commitment to the climate will not be stopped.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said that the effigy represented \u201can incitement to hatred,\u201d adding that \u201cnot only is it a macabre, vulgar vision, but it shows once more that those who are unable to contradict with facts and arguments the movement of young people committed in the battle against the climate crisis have recourse instead to violence and intimidation.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "An effigy of Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg was hung from a Rome bridges with a sign in English saying: \u201cGreta is your God.\u201d", "authors": ["Thomas D.
