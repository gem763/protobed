Well, with his tongue-in-cheek YouTube flicks, he's definitely doing his part!\n\nLil Bubble is a known figure in the Cryptoworld, liked for his talent to parody popular songs and create crypto-themed tracks, sharing them on his Twitter and YouTube channel \u201cThe Crypto Bubble,\u201d garnering so far tens of thousands of views and several thousand retweets. These are accompanied with music videos, featuring a number of details familiar to the crypto proponents, particularly Lil Bubble\u2019s presentation as an astronaut with a rocket, often carrying garbage bags full of altcoins.\n\nThis graphic artist and a music producer prefers not to identify himself, because he doesn\u2019t think his identity\u2019s important for what he does. \u201cLil Bubble is a crypto caricature. The sum of every crypto stereotype expressed in musical form,\u201d he tells us, and adds \u201cI\u2019m just a crypto enthusiast that loves creating things. One of those things is Lil Bubble, so it\u2019s more fun to let him live.\u201d While he grew up drawing and playing in bands, he now designs, edits photos, and makes music and videos, both for work and for fun.\n\nAs for the goals of his music, Lil Bubble tells us that \u201cif anything it\u2019s \u2018taking the piss\u2019 or poking fun at how ridiculous it [the Cryptosphere] can be. That\u2019s something I think is important and hope to continue. We don\u2019t need to take ourselves so seriously all the time. I like to think the lyrics can be a tongue-in-cheek lesson on responsible decision making. By highlighting how silly we can be sometimes, the songs might make viewers question their own actions.\u201d\n\nIdeas are aplenty, it seems, as Lil Bubble says that the Cryptosphere is his inspiration, while he also gets a bunch of parody ideas upon hearing certain songs \u2013 it\u2019s automatic for him by now. \u201cI have no shortage of ideas, I just need more hours in the day to finish them!\"\n\nCreating the Bubble\n\nWhile the latest songs include \u201cMy Ponzi\u201d and \u201cLiquidated,\u201d his earlier YouTube uploads comprise a number of crypto memes created from movie snippets. However, he had realized that he \u201ccould bring my music skills into the mix and make the content from scratch, something a bit more unique,\u201d he says. \u201cLil Bubble was born,\u201d with no big goal, \u201cI\u2019m just making music I find funny [\u2026] for anyone who can relate to the subject matter \u2013 anyone within the cryptosphere!\u201d\n\nGiven his habit of turning everything into a song, he says \u201cthe crypto stuff just happened,\u201d but the reactions to his song have been \u201ckinda crazy,\u201d quickly garnering fans. Lil Bubble makes all the music himself, either on his couch or in his spare bedroom/home studio, while his friends help him make videos. \u201cThe beauty of a comedic project is the work can happen fast \u2013 the music and video are often first takes. Imperfections just add to the humor.\u201d\n\nLil Bubble tells us that he is a guitarist who grew up on metal and rap, and with a musical background in rock bands and electronic production. \u201cThe Lil Bubble project just lets me just have fun with it. I actually used to make parody songs back in school just about my friends and our inside jokes. I guess in a way that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing with Lil Bubble - the crypto community is just a bigger group of friends!\u201d\n\nHe says that he enjoys this \u201cwide mix of people from all areas of life\u201d that forms the crypto community. \u201cI felt like I was the only person in the world who found these ideas funny [\u2026] I love hearing that the songs have brightened someone\u2019s day or made a person laugh.\u201d There will always be somebody who's not a fan, but that is fine, as the music is not meant for them anyways, Lil Bubble says.\n\nOriginal Lil Bubble music coming soon\n\nLil Bubble has plenty planned for the future. Though he just wants to make music for fun, he also says that he gets a lot of requests to get the music onto Spotify, for example. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get the licensing sorted out to allow that to happen,\u201d he tells us. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some original Lil Bubble music soon too.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, he\u2019ll be performing at BlockShow in Singapore this November, and he also continues creating his merchandise, describing it as \u201canother avenue I get to be creative with,\u201d with his next step being to set up crypto payments.\n\nStacking them sats\n\nSpeaking of crypto payments, Lil Bubble\u2019s involvement in crypto space is mostly as a trader, he says, but he has come across \u201cplenty of ideas that sound promising.\u201d His first purchase was ETH in early 2017, on a friend\u2019s recommendation, after five years of planning to buy BTC. \u201cSince then I\u2019ve bought and traded a bunch of alts and have been stacking those sats,\u201d says Lil Bubble.\n\nCrypto is still new, says this trader, and \u201cas projects start delivering I think we\u2019ll see a continued shift towards a very different world in terms of employment and societal structures.\u201d The internet is a good example, as its effects \u201care still taking shape and we\u2019re seeing new career opportunities and wealth transfers in areas that just sounded crazy 10-20 years ago. I think crypto will just enhance the new gig economy and allow the monetization of our interests, which is exciting to a creator.\u201d\n\n__\n\nCheck out some of Lil Bubble's work bellow:\n\n__\n\n__\n\n__", "description": "You\u2019ve probably heard crypto anthems \u201cAll Time Lows\u201d and \u201cWhen Moon?\u201d The person behind these parodies is called Lil Bubble, who told us that the Cryptosphere shouldn't take itself so seriously all the time.
