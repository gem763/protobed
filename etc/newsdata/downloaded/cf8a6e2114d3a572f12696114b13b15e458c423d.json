For most of the race he was trailing Petronas Yamaha's Fabio Quartararo, who was racing at the Chang International Circuit for the first time.\n\nA thrilling wheel-to-wheel duel on the sun-baked circuit in Buriram ensued between the 20 year-old French rookie and the reigning World Champion -- only at the final turn did Marquez overtake the young pretender, who very nearly secured his first ever victory.\n\nThere were only 0.171 seconds between them at the finishing line.\n\nThe victory gives Marquez a now-unassailable 325 points - his nearest rival Andrea Dovizioso of Ducati has only 215.\n\nThat makes the 26 year old Marquez the youngest rider to win 6 Moto GP titles. It's his 8th career title overall.", "description": "After winning the Thai Grand Prix on Sunday, Honda's Marc Marquez has won his 6th Moto GP title, and his 8th career title overall.
