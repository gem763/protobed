'He is a great player and scorer.\n\n'He knows that he has the ability to come up with goals for the team, with his shooting from distance or running into the area. And he created a lot as well.\n\n'We told him all the time in training that we know the goals will come for him, because he has that ability, especially from long range.\n\n'Last season maybe his confidence dropped a bit and he stopped trying to shoot.\n\nAleksandar Mitrovic scores the first of his two goals in Fulham's 4-1 victory over Reading\n\n'But we kept telling him and kept pushing him, and now he is back and we are seeing the goals he is scoring - four in the last three games.\n\n'So that is amazing and really contributes towards what the team is trying to achieve.'\n\nCairney, 28, managed just the one goal last season as Fulham's return to the Premier League proved short-lived.\n\nAnd it's no coincidence that Cairney has returned to goalscoring form just as Fulham have shaken off their early season inconsistency with back-to-back wins - 2-0 at home to Wigan and 4-1 at Reading.\n\nTom Cairney celebrates after scoring in Fulham's 2-0 win over Wigan at Craven Cottage\n\nAnd having scored in five consecutive Championship matches earlier in the campaign, Serbian striker Mitrovic ended a three-game drought with two goals in three minutes at the Madejski Stadium.\n\n'There are a lot of goals in this team,' defender Alfie Mawson said. 'Tom Cairney is flying again - he has five goals in 10, and Mitro has seven in 10 - and both have assists too.\n\n'Let's be honest, nothing went our way in the Premier League last season and most things that could go wrong did go wrong.\n\n'We weren't good enough, didn't play well enough and didn't work hard enough until the last few games it was too late.\n\nScott Parker's Fulham host Charlton Athletic in the Championship's early kick-off on Saturday\n\n'But with Tom, he is a top, top player and our captain for a reason. He has signed a new [five-year] contract which is good for the club and the fans.\n\n'And if you give him chances, outside or inside the box, he is going to score.\n\n'Mitro got 11 last season in the Premier league so he is always going to score in the Championship. I'm not saying it is easy for him, but he is proven.\n\n'He is getting more chances than last season, and we need that if we are going to get promoted.'\n\nWatching brief Fulham vs Charlton Athletic, Championship, Saturday 12.30pm, Live on Sky Sports Football and Sky Sports Main Event.", "description": "Tom Cairney's recent goal glut for Fulham is the result of his team-mates begging him to shoot more, according to the team's scoring expert Aleksandar Mitrovic.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/22/19316934-0-image-a-53_1570226140109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
