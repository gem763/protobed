Schumer said Mr. Trump has a chance to do something \u201cdifferent and courageous\u201d on the issue of guns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said this before: there are only two people standing in the way - President Trump and Leader McConnell,\u201d the New York Democrat said on Tuesday. \u201cThe president should use - finally use a little bit of his capital with Republicans to do the right thing and lead his party and this country to this historic opportunity of passing strong gun safety laws.\u201d\n\nMs. Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi spoke by phone with the president over the weekend about the issue, though Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump was noncommittal.\n\nSenate Democrats were planning to take to the Senate floor later on Tuesday to tell stories about gun violence in a bid to try to force some legislative action.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
