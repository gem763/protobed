They have already come out and said they want to fight fire with fire and I guess we return it by saying, \"Bring it on\".\n\n'It is a final and it's one of those things you have to front up to as one of their biggest assets.\n\n'Big hits are something that you probably can't measure, but I think the best way to explain it is that it's quite contagious.\n\n'It shows everyone it can be done, so everyone else tries to follow in the slip streams of Sam Underhill, Tom Curry, Maro Itoje.'\n\nEngland's stunning semi-final victory over the All Blacks has made them favourites to lift the Webb Ellis Cup on Saturday.\n\nVunipola says England can back their words up after vowing to use their 'big blokes' well\n\nSaturday's final pits the likes of Vermeulen and Tendai Mtawarira against Vunipola, Sam Underhill and their England team-mates\n\nWith that comes pressure - and Vunipola says England are determined to prove that their semi-final performance was not just a 'fluke'.\n\n'The All Blacks have been the best in the world forever and that physicality has helped them get to that stage,' said Vunipola.\n\n'We set out wanting to be the best in the world, and we have to back up what we did last week. It can't just be a fluke. I think the challenge has been laid out by South Africa - as you saw them taking Japan apart, and Wales, the challenge is going to be up front so we are going to have to be there, both mentally and physically.\n\n'Our goal was always to be No 1.'\n\nUnderhill (right) has helped set the tone at this Rugby World Cup with his big hits\n\nVunipola's family from Tonga are flying over for the final \u2013 but the No 8 emphasised the importance of focusing on the task at hand.\n\n'We're trying to lock in on Saturday and see how we can come out firing,' said Vunipola.\n\n'Family support is very important to us but things can also be a distraction.\n\n'Tickets, giving you pointers on how to play rugby\u2026 my auntie is always great for that. She's trying to tell me how to play No 8 and giving my brother a few pointers as well!'", "description": "NIK SIMON IN TOKYO: Billy Vunipola says England's big hits will be 'contagious' against South Africa in the World Cup final.
