In St. Lucia, he was admitted to the top high school on the island, where he became president of the school house, a leader for several clubs and convinced one of his teachers to start a choir due to his love for singing.\n\nAfter high school, Botham Jean decided to study accounting at Harding University, a private Christian college in Searcy, Arkansas, his mother said. There, he did a lot of missionary-type work and was involved in preaching and singing and was dedicated to helping vulnerable members of the community, such as the elderly and disadvantaged children, his mother said.\n\nHe even started a yearly trip for him and his fellow students to St. Lucia, where they would participate in outreach programs for delinquent boys and orphans, Allison Jean said.\n\nDuring his senior year in college, Botham Jean was hired by multinational professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers after what was supposed to be a six-week internship was extended to six months, his mother said.\n\nJeff Montgomery/Harding University via AP\n\nHe was killed days before his 27th birthday, Allison Jean said. He would have turned 28 this past Sunday.\n\nAllison Jean said she and her family's lives have been turned upside down since her middle child was killed. She has had difficultly working, sleeping and eating and has been worried about her youngest son, who \"doesn't speak much\" anymore.\n\n\"And I have to keep the family together, because everybody's in pain,\" she said.\n\nThe last time she and her husband saw Botham Jean was in February 2018, when he traveled to New York in an attempt to surprise his parents, Allison Jean said. The last time she spoke to him was the day before he was killed.\n\nABC News\n\nSince his death, the family has started a foundation in his name, which launched this past weekend at a gala in Dallas, Allison Jean said.
