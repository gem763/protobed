Rather than being seen as an exception to Canadian racial enlightenment, perhaps the images of Trudeau in blackface are better viewed as a microcosm of Canada\u2019s little known past.\n\nOver the past year, Americans have seen the governors of two states embroiled in scandals over past blackface use. Ralph Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, was revealed to have a blackface photo on his medical-school yearbook page in the early 1980s. (Northam initially apologized, then said he did not believe he was the person in the photo.) The state\u2019s attorney general, the Democrat Mark Herring, also apologized for wearing blackface to a party around the same time. In August, Alabama Republican Governor Kay Ivey also apologized for wearing blackface in college.\n\nAs my colleague Adam Harris has written, controversies around the use of blackface on campus seem to spring up every year, a trend that begins around the turn of the 21st century. Something similar seems to have occurred in Canada. In a 2017 paper, Philip S. S. Howard, a professor at McGill University, argued that blackface was \u201cexperiencing renewed popularity in Canada,\u201d pointing to a string of incidents over roughly the same period.\n\nBlackface, a practice that grew out of minstrel shows that caricatured people of African descent, can seem like a peculiarly American institution, but it has a long history in Canada as well\u2014as does slavery. While Canada figures in the history of American slavery as a terminus on the Underground Railroad, enslaved Africans arrived in Canada in the early 17th century, not long after their first arrival in what is now the United States in 1619, and slavery wasn\u2019t abolished in Canada until 1834.\n\nPerhaps no figure illustrates the complicated connections between race, Canada, and the United States better than Calixa Lavall\u00e9e. Born to a French Canadian family in Quebec, Lavall\u00e9e moved to the United States in the 1850s and bounced back and forth between the two countries for years. He served as an officer in the Union Army during the Civil War; he also played in minstrel shows, performing in blackface, doing exaggerated impressions of African Americans. In 1880, he was commissioned to write a hymn that would become \u201cO Canada,\u201d the national anthem. (Later in life, he supported Quebec joining the United States. People are complicated.)\n\nRead: Justin Trudeau\u2019s feminist brand is exploding\n\nMinstrelsy took hold in Canada, just as it did in the United States, and just as in the United States, black people objected. As early as 1843, according to Cheryl Thompson, a scholar of communications at Ryerson University, black residents of Toronto petitioned the city government in vain to ban minstrel shows. Howard reports that \u201cminstrelsy was very common throughout Canada into the 1970s,\u201d long after minstrel shows had become socially taboo\u2014not to say extinct\u2014in the United States.
