He said the pitcher allegedly texted him on the day he departed for Texas requesting more pills but Kay claims he could not fulfill the request.\n\nHe further claimed that he was in Skaggs' hotel room on the night he died and that he saw the star snorted three lines of crushed opioids in front of him.\n\nKay has long been struggling with his own addiction problems and is currently on paid leave with the Angels as he seeks treatment.\n\nKay claimed that five other Angels players also used opiates while with the team, though the identities of the players named by Kay have not been made public.\n\nHe claims he wasn't the only Angels staffer with knowledge of Skaggs' drug use.\n\nKay allegedly told DEA investigators that he discussed Skaggs' opioid habits with Tim Mead, the former Angels vice president of communications and Kay's supervisor, in 2017.\n\nMead - who left the Angels in June - steadfastly denied that accusation.\n\n'I have had a lot of conversations with Eric Kay about a lot of things, but opioids and Tyler Skaggs were not one of them,' he said.\n\nHe also denied knowing that Skaggs used opioids before his death.\n\nKay revealed in a statement to ESPN on Saturday that he frequently abused oxycodone with Skaggs for two years before the star pitcher's sudden death in July\n\nKay claimed that five other Angels players also used opiates while with the team, though the identities of the players named by Kay have not been made public\n\n'We have never heard that any employee was providing illegal narcotics to any player, or that any player was seeking illegal narcotics,' Angels President John Carpino said in a statement.\n\n'The Angels maintain a strict, zero tolerance policy regarding the illicit use of drugs for both players and staff. Every one of our players must also abide by the MLB Joint Drug Agreement. We continue to mourn the loss of Tyler and fully cooperate with the authorities as they continue their investigation.'\n\nLast month, teammate Mike Trout said he was stunned to hear the results of the toxicology report and was unaware that Skaggs was even on opioids in the first place.\n\n'We didn't know he was going through this. Just a tough situation when this came out. Tough to put your mind to it,' the center fielder said to MLB News.\n\nOxycodone is banned pursuant to Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Agreement while fentanyl is labeled as a 'drug of abuse' under the agreement.\n\n'Obviously, it doesn't change my view on Tyler. He made a big impact on my life, this team. I was kind of shocked when the news came out like that. That's tough, but it doesn't change the feeling I have for him and the way he impacted my life,' Trout said.\n\n'Obviously, if I knew I would definitely have said something or did something,' Trout said. 'It's tough. You love Tyler. We didn't know he was going through this. Just a tough situation when this came out. Tough to put your mind to it. But it doesn't change the way I feel about Tyler and the way he impacted my life.'", "description": "Eric Kay, who works within the Los Angeles' PR department, was spotted on Monday in California after revealing he had spoken with authorities investigating Tyler Skaggs' death.", "authors": ["Emily Crane", "Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/03/19767972-0-image-a-44_1571192997743.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
