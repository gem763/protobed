This is not to say it does not have some level of success, but to suggest it is adequate or efficient is disingenuous and dangerous.\n\nTo be sure, the government allocated R222.6 billion for the provision of health services for the country\u2019s 57.7 million citizens this year.\n\nOn the other hand, you have a densely concentrated private health system, marked by outpriced medical aids and hospitals locked in a symbiotic dance of payment and delivery, drawing skilled doctors into its vortex of networks which are available, essentially, only to an estimated 9 million citizens who have the income to participate.\n\nThis is unsustainable.\n\nThe much-vaunted National Health Insurance (NHI) is beginning to gather pace in implementation, yet faces very real challenges which, if not addressed, will scupper what is arguably one of the country\u2019s most ambitious and crucial interventions since the implementation of the social grant system. It\u2019s failure will lead to a critical failure of the country\u2019s national health service.\n\nAs with any other critical services the country requires, and one that is enshrined in our Constitution as a human rights imperative \u2013 education, electricity, water, housing and health \u2013 the engagement of the private sector carries with it a fraught morality.\n\nHow does government engage with a entity that is, at its core, driven by the need to maximise the return on its capital investment to the benefit of private/institutional shareholders, while at the same time ensure that the NHI \u2013 which is poised to become the biggest procurer of health services \u2013 is fairly priced, efficient and sufficiently effective to serve the country\u2019s health needs?\n\nTo get to grips with the modalities of the private health system, the Competition Commission released the final Health Market Inquiry report this week after a five-year investigation into competition in the sector.\n\nThe conclusions were neither kind nor sparing. They paint a damning picture which, if not specifically named as collusion, can certainly indicate a market of self-serving interests, where private hospitals, medical aids and doctors exist.\n\nAt the coalface sits the citizen, the person in medical need, who is neither considered nor catered for beyond the provision of a service that they have no power in negotiating and can measure neither the outcome of nor the quality of the care received. They are unable to do this as there is no mechanism within either private or public health that gathers this data.\n\nAdditionally, medical funders or medical aids have been allowed to operate in a regulation-free environment which has distorted competition. No clear offers of service, too many medical aid options and exclusionary practices which put the health of many who cannot afford it at risk.\n\nThe consumer is at the whim of the providers\u2019 discretion and, in fact, is a victim of a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d where fee-for-service drives hospitalisation which in turn has unnecessary cost implications.\n\nThe deconstruction of this symbiotic system is necessary to ensure that fair and adequate access to healthcare is available for everyone.\n\nThe Competition Commission\u2019s recommendations in this regard are wide-ranging and deep, and it warns that market failures will persist if a partial intervention only is applied.\n\nAmong its recommendations are both the regulation of the supply side and the regulation of the demand side of health. Several regulatory bodies are suggested to manage the outcomes of both and ensure competitive pricing and accessibility.\n\nTo combat the high concentration of hospital care by the three players \u2013 Netcare, Mediclinic and Life Healthcare \u2013 the commission will review their approach to creeping mergers. It also recommends the establishment of a dedicated healthcare regulatory authority (SSRH) to regulate the suppliers of healthcare services which includes health facilities and services. The SSRH will have four main functions: healthcare facility planning (where hospitals are situated and licensed); economic value assessments, monitoring health services and health services pricing.\n\nCrucial to future pricing will be a multilateral negotiating forum for all practitioners to set a maximum price for prescribed minimum benefits. Where no agreement is reached, an arbitration process will come into play.\n\nFor practitioners, there are interventions to promote competitive pricing and a move away from fee-for-service contracts.\n\nFunders or medical aids are encouraged to offer a single, standardised base option to increase competition. This will offer consumers a chance to compare prices and reward those that are innovative and are able to offer lower prices. In addition, the introduction of a risk adjustment measure to medical aids will remove the incentive of medical aids to compete on risk. Schemes should compete on metrics and not age,health or risk profile.\n\nWhile the Competition Commission\u2019s final report is an elegant document, which rationally describes the flaws of the sector and the recommendations to bring it back into line, at the centre of this lies the role of the government.\n\nIts failure to implement a rigorous regulatory regime can be blamed largely for the rampant rise of the private health sector and the vacuum in which it operates. Its control over the public health sector has been poor.\n\nFor its part, the government lacks capacity for effective administration, it is unable to retain doctor skills and appears to turn a blind eye to ailing infrastructure or to building new hospitals.\n\nIt cannot rely on the private sector to save it.\n\nWhat it can and must do, is to use its looming procurement influence to negotiate pricing in its favour. It must, as an imperative, force the participation of the private sector, without consideration for shareholder interest beyond a certain threshold.\n\nIt must, too, get its own house in order. To add a bad apple to a healthy basket will spread the rot everywhere.\n\nUltimately, if there is no consensus between these opposing factions, our health system is doomed to collapse.", "description": "NHI faces real challenges which could scupper one of SA\u2019s most ambitious and crucial interventions, writes Gabriel Seeber.", "authors": ["Gabriel Seeber"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9415/333deb80a06447fe96332a28f2c87c04.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
