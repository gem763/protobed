Yet that becomes less true with every day that passes.\n\nFiat Chairman John Elkann withdrew his merger offer in June after the French state signalled it wanted Renault, in which it owns a 15% stake, to sort out its alliance with Japan\u2019s Nissan Motor first. That puts on hold 5 billion euros in potential cost savings - worth 33 billion euros to investors today, or almost as much as their combined market value.\n\nThose goodies are still on offer, but the clock is ticking. Many of the touted savings involved Fiat adopting technologies and basic car designs, known as \u201cplatforms\u201d, that Renault had already developed.\n\nTake, for example, lower-emission vehicles. Elkann\u2019s company, with a strong reliance on Jeeps and Dodge trucks, has been skimping on capital expenditures in this area. Over 2018 and 2019, Fiat\u2019s total capex will be 13.7 billion euros, or 6% of revenue, using Refinitiv data. If Elkann had instead invested at Renault\u2019s 8% ratio, Fiat\u2019s spending would be almost one-third higher at 18 billion euros.\n\nWhy is that a problem? Imagine Renault spends another six months courting tepid partner and 15% shareholder Nissan, whose two directors planned to abstain last time on Renault\u2019s board vote on the merger. That takes Elkann to March 2020.\n\nA lengthy antitrust review would probably postpone the deal\u2019s completion until well into 2021 - the year in which new European carbon emissions rules bite. That timeline isn\u2019t good for Fiat, whose relatively dirty fleet of vehicles is further away than other major European carmakers from meeting its 2021 target, Goldman Sachs estimates.\n\nElkann has other options, including making investments using Fiat\u2019s giant net cash pile, which should reach 4.5 billion euros at the end of 2019. He could also partner with German behemoth Volkswagen, which is building the world\u2019s largest dedicated electric-vehicle platform; or even tie up with France\u2019s Peugeot.\n\nTurin-based Fiat will probably embark on one of these backup plans if Renault hasn\u2019t come back to the table by 2020, three people familiar with the original merger proposal told Breakingviews. That gives the deal a fast-approaching expiration date.", "description": "(Reuters Breakingviews) - The collapsed 36 billion euro marriage of carmakers Renault and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles still makes a lot of sense.
