Assad for Peace Prize?\n\nAD\n\nVlora Citaku, Kosovo\u2019s ambassador to Washington, called Handke \u201ca propagator of ethnic hatred & violence\u201d and shared a photograph of him at Milosevic\u2019s funeral in 2006. Albania\u2019s acting foreign minister, Gent Cakaj, wrote on Twitter that the Nobel had been awarded to \u201ca genocide denier.\"\n\nAD\n\nWriters and academics also expressed unease on social media. Historian Orlando Figes wrote that he was deeply shocked that Handke had won the Nobel, describing him as a \u201cnotorious apologist for the murderous regime of Slobodan Milosevic.\u201d\n\nFor the Nobel judges, it may be an unwelcome return to controversy. The unprecedented decision to confer two prizes this year had occurred in the wake of a sexual assault scandal that erupted in late 2017, leading to a decision to delay last year\u2019s prize.\n\nAD\n\nPolish author Olga Tokarczuk also won the prize Thursday, making her one of only 15 women to have been awarded the Nobel Prize in literature since it was first given out in 1901.\n\nBoth Handke and Tokarczuk are widely considered masterful writers, with the Austrian\u2019s long and productive career dating to 1966 and his debut novel, \u201cThe Hornets.\u201d But Handke has been dogged by his links to Serbian nationalism since the 1990s.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1996, Handke wrote an essay about a trip to Serbia for the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung that questioned the media\u2019s portrayal of Serbs as the aggressor in the conflicts sparked after the collapse of the Yugoslavian state.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn an effort to bring the war to their customers, international magazines from Time to the Nouvel Observateur relentlessly portray the Serbs as evil and the Muslims as the usual good guy,\u201d Handke wrote.\n\nThe article was published a year after a massacre in the town of Bosnian Srebrenica after Serbian forces overran a Muslim-held enclave and killed thousands of men and boys.\n\nWhen NATO allies later bombed Serbia, Handke again rose to the country\u2019s defense. In 1999, when appearing on Serbian television, he suggested that he might like to be a \u201cSerbian Orthodox monk fighting for Kosovo\u201d and compared the plight of the Serbs to the persecution of Jews (he later apologized for invoking the Holocaust).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSCANDALOUS! #Nobel committee decides to award Peter Handke - a man who glorified Milosevic aka \u201cThe Butcher of The Balkans\u201d & supported his genocidal regime - this year\u2019s prize in litterature.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing nobel about this!\n\nThis is a is a preposterous & shameful decision pic.twitter.com/BirMYS9qgP \u2014 Vlora \u00c7itaku (@vloracitaku) October 10, 2019\n\nAfter Milosevic died in his prison cell in The Hague in 2006 while on trial for war crimes, Handke spoke at his funeral in Serbia, telling a crowd of thousands that he was \u201cclose to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milosevic.\u201d\n\nHandke, who was born to a German father and a Slovenian mother and raised near Austria\u2019s border with what was then Yugoslavia, has said his family history is why he is so interested in the Balkans.\n\n\u201cI am a writer and not a judge,\u201d he told the New York Times in 2006 after attending Milosevic\u2019s funeral. \u201cI\u2019m a lover of Yugoslavia \u2014 not so much Serbia, but Yugoslavia \u2014 and I wanted to accompany the fall of my favorite country in Europe, and this is one of the reasons to be at the funeral.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe links to Serbia had long earned Handke derision among his peers. Author Salman Rushdie nominated him as \u201cmoron of the year\u201d in 1999, while David Rieff, a writer and analyst, savaged Handke\u2019s book on Serbia in a 1997 review.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe truth is that he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about, except presumably, as he does throughout much of the book, when he\u2019s talking about himself,\u201d Rieff wrote. \u201cHe came to Serbia knowing nothing about its complicated politics and, to judge by the book, left knowing no more.\u201d\n\nThe links had long been a problem in receiving other prizes, too. In 2006, he was nominated for Dusseldorf\u2019s Heinrich Heine Prize, but the award was withdrawn after members of the city council objected. When he won the International Ibsen Award in 2014, one academic compared it to awarding Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels the \u201cImmanuel Kant Prize.\u201d\n\nHandke did go on to accept the Ibsen in Oslo and in a defensive acceptance speech told his critics to \u201cgo to hell.\u201d However, he renounced the $400,000 prize money that came with the award.\n\nAD", "description": "The Austrian Nobel laureate spoke at Slobodan Milosevic's funeral after the Serbian leader died amid a war crimes trial.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Uso4B9DKhGLHUS08TBD7w7nNMcU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R7VELGHLNQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
