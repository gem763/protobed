One executive even put a ballpark figure on where he believed the compensation for Ramsey would land: something in the neighborhood of what the Kansas City Chiefs surrendered for defensive end Frank Clark, which netted the Seattle Seahawks a 2019 first-round pick, a 2020 second-round pick and a swap of 2019 third-round picks that moved Kansas City up eight spots.\n\nThat type of trade bounty has apparently never interested Khan, who not only is standing firm on a price of two \u201cquality\u201d first-round picks, but prefers to keep Ramsey and sign him to a long-term contract extension.\n\n\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean Ramsey is off the trade market. The opposing executives agreed he\u2019s still available. But the Jaguars aren\u2019t willing to let Ramsey go for anything under what they perceive to be maximum value. Now a deal that once looked like it could develop swiftly has been complicated by the reality that it\u2019s Khan \u2014 and not the front office \u2014 setting the trade bar.\n\nJaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey was sidelined from Sunday's game in Denver against the Broncos. Jacksonville won, 26-24. (AP)\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nStory continues\n\nAs one executive framed it, \u201cThe idea that nothing has changed [in the trade dynamic] is wrong. Ownership is obviously involved and a hurdle to overcome.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat that will ultimately mean for Ramsey\u2019s market remains to be seen. A league source told Yahoo Sports late this week that a wide swath of teams have kept tabs on Ramsey\u2019s availability, including the Seahawks, Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Ravens. Thus far, none of those teams has felt compelled to meet the somewhat nebulous trade value Khan is seeking. Complicating matters more is that the teams aren\u2019t speaking to Khan directly. Instead, they are communicating with a Jaguars front office that isn\u2019t empowered to do a deal without the team owner signing off on the structure \u2014 fully knowing that Khan ultimately may not be inclined to trade Ramsey regardless of what is offered.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that Ramsey still wants to get off the Jacksonville roster, and opposing NFL teams still view him as having All-Pro ability at his position. One executive said Ramsey is the league\u2019s most attractive trade commodity since the Raiders made dominant edge rusher Khalil Mack available last preseason. Oakland ultimately dealt Mack and two draft picks (a second-rounder and a conditional fifth-rounder) to the Chicago Bears for two first-round picks, a third-round pick and a sixth-rounder. The Bears also surrendered the highest-paid defensive contract in NFL history to Mack on the heels of the trade. That is important, considering Ramsey is expected to want a contract extension sooner than later from any franchise that would acquire him.\n\n\n\nAs it stands, Ramsey hasn\u2019t been on the field with the Jaguars since the team\u2019s 20-7 victory over the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 19. He has since missed practice due to illness, back \u201ctightness\u201d and an excused absence for the birth of his second child. He joined the team in Denver for Sunday\u2019s game against the Broncos but ultimately sat out the win due to the aforementioned back injury.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether he will take the field with the Jaguars next week against Carolina as he continues to press for a trade.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The star cornerback still wants out of Jacksonville.
