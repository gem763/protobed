For the purposes of comparison, we are purely looking at how many more consultants will be required to fill the expected market increase,\" she said.\n\nAustralia has dropped behind Britain for clients' \"propensity to buy\" consulting services with the uncertainty caused by Brexit leading to a spike in demand in that part of the world.\n\n\"UK clients are already the most eager consulting buyers in the world, and as the seemingly interminable Brexit saga drags on, more and more of them are looking for help planning for what comes next,\" Ms Richards wrote in the report.\n\nThe research company's findings were not all upbeat for the local consulting industry. Ms Richards warned that slowing GDP growth could begin to hurt if businesses started to cut back on their advisory spend.\n\n\"Slowing GDP growth isn\u2019t doing this market any favours ... While Australia\u2019s robust consulting industry is well positioned to weather a slowdown, firms looking to grow may want to ask themselves if they\u2019re prepared to be upping investment at a time when clients may very well be easing off the accelerator,\" she said.", "description": "The Australian consulting industry will need to find another 4500 staff over the next three years to keep pace with demand for services, a study finds.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_2.2074%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/402774159d143ddbebe5e6de10b39b3760725137", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
