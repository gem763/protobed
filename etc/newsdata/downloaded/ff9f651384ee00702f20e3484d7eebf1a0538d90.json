Michigan has also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarettes.\n\nSome members of the Public Health and Health Planning Council said they were torn about approving the emergency measure, while others said it should have included a ban on menthol e-cigarettes. The ban went into effect immediately and is expected to last 90 days, with the expectation that it will be renewed absent a permanent legislative ban.\n\nGlenn Martin, a member of the council and a doctor, said that e-cigarette use is a public health concern but voted against the regulation, calling the ban a \u201cbig public health experiment,\u201d with a possible unintended consequence of the destruction of the e-cigarette retailing industry. \u201cI\u2019m just not convinced this is an emergency,\u201d he said. Lawrence Brown, another council member and an addiction specialist, said public health has always been a process of slow progress. \u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned about doing nothing,\u201d Dr. Brown said. Dozens of people who use or sell e-cigarette products showed up in person to the council\u2019s meeting, which was held by videoconference at locations across the state, to protest the ban. They said flavored e-cigarettes have helped people stop smoking combustible cigarettes. Vape-shop owners said the ban would effectively put them out of business. Others said the ban was a form of prohibition and would push e-cigarette users back to cigarettes or drive the creation of flavored \u201cvape juice\u201d underground. Dennis Mink, who spoke before the council, said he smoked cigarettes for 48 years. He had tried medication, therapy, acupuncture and other measures to stop using cigarettes, he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think vaping was going to work either,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can quit. Nothing tops vaping!\u201d The ban is effective immediately. Retailers will have until Oct. 4 before the state begins enforcing the new regulation. Retailers who violate the ban on sales will face fines of up to $2,000 per violation. Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, recently invested almost $13 billion in e-cigarette company Juul. Some experts say in its early days Juul mirrored the tobacco industry\u2019s promotional playbook in an effort to hook young people. Photo: Natalia V.
