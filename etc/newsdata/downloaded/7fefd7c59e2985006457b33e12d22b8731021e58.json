Photos by AFP/Getty Images and Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nAs House Democrats formally launched their impeachment inquiry, President Donald Trump was making a striking argument in a separate case that, if accepted, could insulate him from any criminal investigation whatsoever. In a New York federal court Wednesday, Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that prosecutors cannot review his financial records in connection with a criminal investigation so long as he is in office.\n\nLast week, Trump filed a federal lawsuit in the Southern District of New York seeking to bar the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office from enforcing a subpoena served on an accounting firm seeking Trump\u2019s personal and corporate tax returns and other financial records. In his complaint, Trump broadly argues that the Constitution bars a president from being subject to \u201ccriminal process\u201d while he is in office.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that he is immune not just from indictment but also from investigation is squarely at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in U.S. v. Nixon. The court rejected President Richard Nixon\u2019s claim that he was protected by \u201cabsolute privilege\u201d from the reach of a grand jury subpoena and ordered him to turn over White House tapes containing the evidence that ultimately forced him from office. Trump is betting that the Supreme Court will overrule that decision and protect him, and he may win the bet.\n\nTrump\u2019s case appears weak, but that does not mean it is doomed.\n\nThe subpoena Trump seeks to quash likely relates to an investigation into whether Trump, his companies, or his associates made misstatements in state tax filings, including about the hush money payment Trump made to Stormy Daniels. Unlike in the Nixon case, the subpoena is not directed to the president himself; also, the DA\u2019s investigation apparently is not solely (or likely primarily) focused on Trump\u2019s conduct in office and seems to concern events during the 2016 campaign, and possibly prior periods. Furthermore, Trump has yet to face any demands, let alone charges, from New York prosecutors.\n\nTrump\u2019s case appears weak, but that does not mean it is doomed. His lawyers acknowledge that no court has upheld their assertion that the president cannot be investigated. Furthermore, Trump largely relies on authorities addressing whether a sitting president can be indicted, not whether a law enforcement investigation implicating a president must be wholly delayed until a president leaves office, as Trump contends. Additionally, as the prosecutors demonstrated, there is a substantial argument that Trump\u2019s case does not even belong in federal court, given principles of federalism, reflected in Supreme Court precedent and statutory law, that broadly limit federal court interference with state criminal proceedings. (In a filing Tuesday night, Attorney General William Barr\u2019s Justice Department indicated that it may soon intervene in the case, presumably on Trump\u2019s behalf.)\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s hearing, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero asked searching questions about Trump\u2019s position. Among other things, the judge noted that Trump\u2019s lawyers had not clearly explained what they meant by \u201ccriminal process,\u201d or why existing law requires the complete shutdown of an investigation regarding a president\u2019s conduct. In that regard, as the prosecutors pointed out, the tax returns could well be relevant to potential charges against Trump\u2019s associates and companies as well as Trump himself. Accordingly, if Trump\u2019s argument were accepted, it could effectively insulate Trump\u2019s family and the Trump Organization from criminal investigation so long as Trump remains in office.\n\nBut, as Marrero also appeared to recognize, the largest problem with Trump\u2019s argument is that it appears to be irreconcilable with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision requiring Nixon to turn over the White House tapes. As now\u2013Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed in an article he wrote in 1998, the Nixon decision stands for the proposition that a president must turn over \u201crelevant evidence in criminal proceedings,\u201d absent a specific claim of a threat to national security.\n\nThe judge closed the hearing by encouraging the parties to attempt to reach a consensual resolution, rather than litigating the matter up through the federal courts, and the parties thereafter agreed to a standstill that will extend until Oct. 7 (unless the judge rules earlier). Given the apparent weakness of Trump\u2019s legal position, one might normally expect his lawyers to take up Marrero\u2019s suggestion and negotiate in good faith. The prosecutors, however, expressed well-founded skepticism that Trump will do so. There is every reason to believe that Trump will attempt to use this case as a mechanism to ask the Supreme Court to nullify the Nixon decision and obtain a ruling providing Trump with the complete immunity he desires from any criminal investigation.\n\nGet Slate in Your Inbox Slate\u2019s sharpest takes, curated and distilled by Slate\u2019s copy desk, delivered to your inbox every day.

Kavanaugh has praised the Nixon decision as a moment of courage for the court, but during a 1999 forum, Kavanaugh opined that \u201cmaybe Nixon was wrongly decided\u2014heresy though it is to say so.\u201d He questioned whether the court had improperly taken \u201caway the power of the president to control information in the executive branch.\u201d It is possible, Kavanaugh observed, that \u201cthe tension of the time,\u201d during Watergate, \u201cled to an erroneous decision.\u201d In a 2009 article that Trump cited in his complaint, Kavanaugh went even further, suggesting that Congress enact a law overruling Nixon and categorically barring the investigation or indictment of a sitting president. Now that he is a Supreme Court justice, Kavanaugh, together with his fellow conservative justices, is in a position to reach that result, without the need for an act of Congress.\n\nAdditionally, even as he is attempting to bar any criminal investigation touching upon his conduct, Trump is arguing that Congress has no right to review the still-secret underlying grand jury evidence Robert Mueller assembled in connection with its now rapidly advancing impeachment inquiry. That claim could well also end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the arguments that Trump is advancing in both of these proceedings are accepted by Kavanaugh and his colleagues, Trump and every president after him could, quite literally, be placed above the law, and Nixon\u2019s long-mocked claim that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means that it is not illegal\u201d would actually become true.", "description": "\u201cWhen the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\u201d", "authors": ["David R.
