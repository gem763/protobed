We have worked hard to create strong security controls and supporting documentation for adhering to and maintaining the standards demanded by the regulator, as well as our own privacy policy,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, Mills said the company plans to make additional investments in digital technologies in the next 12 months.\n\nHe said specific areas include modernising its core insurance platforms, a new mobile app, leveraging wearables, and further personalisation opportunities.\n\n\"One of our key business strategies is personalised healthcare which focuses on harnessing data science and digital technologies to better 'personalise' our relationship with members,\" he said.\n\nMills added NIB is also looking to migrate other core platforms, beyond its health insurance business.\n\n\"We will be looking at all of our core platforms, which doesn't just include the health insurance platform, but also our travel platforms and New Zealand business. Our aim is to get out of data centres as quickly as we possibly can,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been able to decommission three in recent times, but the geography of the business means we have them spread across Australia and New Zealand. Cloud is the way in which we're driving that.\"\n\nBack in 2017, Mills revealed to ZDNet that NIB believed the health insurance industry needed to undergo change and technology would be the enabler.\n\n\"From our point of view, we probably see ourselves as a disrupter ... we only have about 10 percent market share, but we see ourselves as trying to be fairly agile, nimble, and really try and bring innovation through,\" he explained.\n\n\"Innovation is part of our culture; it's how we operate the business ... we always try experimenting with new initiatives.\"\n\nAt the time, NIB was developing AI and chatbot technology, and running a pilot based on AWS Lex.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "The health insurance provider has migrated its corporate health insurance business to AWS Cloud.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/27/3e7549f3-3c77-4382-9278-e894fdc0beae/thumbnail/770x578/5b60303242875e440e50488980ccef73/istock-511098307cloudtools.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
