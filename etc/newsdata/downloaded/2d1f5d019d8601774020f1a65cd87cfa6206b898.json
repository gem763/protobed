Celebrating Diwali with loved ones has always helped the bond grow stronger. There is something about diyas, gifts, and food that helps set the mood. However, what does one do when they are in a long-distance relationship? How do you celebrate Diwali together while being miles away from each other? Worry not as we have got you covered. Here are some things that you could look at while celebrating Diwali.\n\nNothing spells the magic of Diwali like sending a gift to your partner. This gift can be his or her pillow, a kurta that he can wear for Diwali or a Diwali starter kit. You could even send him something that he wanted to buy for a very long time. At the end of the day, nothing makes a person smile like receiving a gift from their loved ones.If you can manage to get a leave and can travel to where your partner is then this option is for you. Plan your entire trip: right from when you land to when you leave. Places you can visit for Diwali, dinner you both can cook together, all of this can lead you to have an amazing Diwali. If it is the other way round, where your partner can come over, you can plan on inviting him for a family get together.For some, it may not be feasible to land up at your partner\u2019s place. And being away on Diwali in spite of being in a relationship does put a dampener on festivities. So how about a video call? Light the diyas, arrange the meal and then dial him. While this may not be as good as having him in front of you, it is still something that will light up your Diwali. You should also make sure that your internet connection is stable!Ever heard of the story of a couple wanting to surprise each other? Of how they both ended up at each other\u2019s place across geographies only to realise that their partner had the same idea? If you plan to surprise your partner by visiting him, then you should give him a heads up! Even if it is a surprise video call, understand where your partner could be. Plan your Diwali together even if you are in a long-distance relationship, and have a happy one!", "description": "Here are ways you can make Diwali special for your partner in spite of being in a long-distance relationship.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/oct/long-distance-relationship-sm-thumb1571735167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
