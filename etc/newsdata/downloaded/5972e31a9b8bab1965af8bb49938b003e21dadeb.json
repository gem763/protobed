History Says October May Be Different.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nSmall-capitalization stocks made some major progress in September in closing their 2019 performance gap with large-cap stocks, but history says that October may be more difficult.\n\nThe Russell 2000, an index of 2,000 U.S. companies with a median market value of $956 million, had returned 11.9% including dividends this year to the beginning of September. That compares with an 18.5% return for the Russell 1000, which includes the 1,000 largest stocks on the U.S. stock market.\n\nSeptember\u2019s market-wide rotation saw many of the year\u2019s biggest winners tumble while laggards caught up. The small-cap index gained almost 4% since Labor Day, more than doubling the Russell 1000\u2019s return. For the full year, the Russell 2000 is now up about 14%, versus nearly 20% for the Russell 1000.\n\nThe Russell 2000\u2019s history shows that investors shouldn\u2019t expect much from the index in October. The 10th month of the year tends to see the small-cap index lose more than a percentage point on average, and end about half of the time, according to Dow Jones Market Data, using performance since 1987.\n\nLast year saw the Russell 2000 drop almost 11% in October, before recovering slightly in November. Other major market crashes have come in October as well. Stocks\u2014and higher-beta small caps in particular\u2014tumbled in October of 1929, 1987, and 2008.\n\nAfter October passes, history says that small-caps tend to be in the clear. November and December have been among the strongest months of the year for small caps. The Russell 2000 was up in four out of five Decembers since 1987, with an average return of 2.6%. November has been in the green 66% of the time, with a 1.5% gain on average.\n\nAnd in the nearer term, quarterly rebalancing of fund portfolios could see some big moves in individual names, according to Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Fund managers with diversified portfolios may often sell some of their best-performing positions at the beginning of each quarter while buying their laggards\u2014in order to get their portfolio allocations back in line with their targets. She\u2019s seen this effect particularly strong at the start of the fourth quarter in October, possibly due to early tax-loss harvesting and managers preparing their positioning for the coming year.\n\n\u201cThe first ten days of October have yielded the widest spread compared to other quarters: since 2008, a simple strategy of buying long-only funds\u2019 top 10 underweights and selling their top 10 overweights, with a holding period of 10 days, would have yielded an average return of 1.7% (or 53% annualized)\u2014in October, compared to an average of just 0.1% (or 2.6% annualized) in the other months,\u201d Subramanian wrote in a report on Monday.\n\nOf course, these are merely monthly averages taken over decades, and each year is different. In 2014, the Russell 2000 popped more than 6% in the month of October. But there\u2019s certainly much to watch on both the macro and company-specific levels this October: U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume next week; third quarter earnings season picks up in the middle of the month, and the Brexit deadline looms on Oct. 31.\n\nWrite to Nicholas Jasinski at nicholas.jasinski@barrons.com", "description": "The Russell 2000 tends to lose more than a percentage point on average in October, and end lower 47% of the time, according to Dow Jones Market Data, using performance since 1987.", "authors": ["Nicholas Jasinski"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-112363/social", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
