Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) said to Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg, and John Hamilton, chief engineer of the company\u2019s commercial airplanes division.\n\nAD\n\nWednesday\u2019s five-and-a-half hour hearing was far more intense than Muilenburg\u2019s appearance before a Senate committee Tuesday. He sat almost level with families of the crash victims, who groaned at Muilenburg\u2019s repeated evocation of his boyhood on an Iowa farm and were angered when Hamilton stumbled over the date of the second crash.Lawmakers raked through the documents they had gathered, asking Muilenburg to account for opportunities seemingly missed to avert the crashes. One congressman returned for several rounds of questioning to establish a single fact, while others assailed Muilenburg for taking home $30 million last year.\n\nAD\n\nRep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), a former chief executive at another company, said that if he was in the same circumstances as Muilenburg he would resign. Muilenburg said he would not.\n\n\u201cI feel responsible to see this though,\u201d Muilenburg said.\n\nAD\n\nDeFazio, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, read to Muilenburg from a December 2015 email sent while the Max was in the middle of its safety certification process with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nIt concerned critical sensors, known as angle of attack (AOA) indicators, that are supposed to give pilots, and airplane systems, reliable information to help understand how the aircraft\u2019s nose is pointed in relation to oncoming wind.\n\nBut in both crashes, faulty data from a single sensor caused an automated feature known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, to fire by mistake, repeatedly forcing the planes\u2019 noses down as pilots struggled to regain control. Boeing\u2019s decision to have MCAS rely on just one sensor, and not both of them, has been a key question in the crash investigations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAre we vulnerable to single AOA sensor failures with the MCAS implementation or is there some checking that occurs?\u201d the engineer asked in the email, read by DeFazio and projected on a screen in the hearing room.\n\n\u201cDid you ever receive this communication and did you respond to that engineer?\u201d DeFazio asked.\n\nHamilton said he did not receive it, though he became aware of it recently. He said it demonstrates Boeing\u2019s openness to hearing safety concerns.\n\n\u201cI think it highlights our engineers do raise questions, in an open culture. They question things,\u201d Hamilton said. He said the company \u201cfollowed our thorough process\u201d and determined that a single sensor was reliable.\n\nAD\n\nBut DeFazio cut him off, saying the critical sensors \u201care pretty delicate little things\u201d jutting out from the front of the planes, and said Boeing has now changed MCAS to rely on both sensors, rather than just one.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe question is, why wasn\u2019t it that way from day one?\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cIf you can do it now, with an extra wire or a software fix or whatever, why didn\u2019t you do it from day one? Why not have that redundancy?\u201d\n\nMuilenburg responded, \u201cMr. Chairman, we\u2019ve asked ourselves that same question, over and over, and if back then we knew everything that we know now, we would have made a different decision.\u201d\n\nThat response echoed language Muilenburg used during Tuesday\u2019s Senate hearing when Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we ground that aircraft a lot sooner so that another tragedy would not happen?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohnson was speaking of the time between the Oct. 29, 2018, Indonesia crash and March 10, when the Ethio\u00adpian Airlines plane went down.\n\n\u201cSenator, we have asked that question over and over, and if we knew everything back then that we know now, we would have made a different decision,\u201d Muilenburg said Tuesday. He said the decision was made with the \u201cdata we had\u201d and that the FAA had emerged from a safety review process with Boeing and \u201cconfirmed the continuing air worthiness of the airplane, and issued that officially. That was the safety case that was built.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe FAA declined to comment.\n\nRep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash) said \u201cone undeniable conclusion\u201d thus far is \u201cthe process by which the Federal Aviation Administration evaluates and certifies aircraft is itself in need of repair.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) said lawmakers should wait until all the investigations into the two crashes are completed before reaching conclusions. He said the causes of a crash are often like \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d with holes representing different problems.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame the pilots, and I don\u2019t absolve Boeing,\u201d he said.\n\nMuilenburg appeared to become emotional at the House hearing Wednesday when he described meeting with the families of those killed in the crashes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to listen, and each of the families told us the stories about the lives that were lost, and those were heartbreaking,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nDeFazio said that Boeing had information that undercut the safety assumptions the company relied on in designing MCAS.\n\nAD\n\nDeFazio said both Boeing and the FAA assumed pilots would react to a problem with MCAS within 4 seconds. \u201cBut Boeing had information . . . that some pilots might react in 10 seconds or longer and if that happened, the results would be catastrophic and result in the loss of the aircraft, as happened twice,\u201d he said.\n\nAt issue, DeFazio explained ahead of Wednesday\u2019s hearing, is whether Boeing had deliberately withheld that information.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board officials last month said Boeing had made inaccurate assumptions about the dangers of MCAS and overestimated pilots\u2019 ability to handle problems with the feature, and that the FAA had accepted Boeing\u2019s assertions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committee investigation found a Boeing \u201ccoordination sheet,\u201d dated June 11, 2018, which read: \u201cA slow reaction time scenario (>10 seconds) found the failure to be catastrophic \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWas the FAA aware of this document?\u201d DeFazio asked.\n\nMuilenburg said he could not speak to the specific document but that \u201cwe made some mistakes on MCAS\u201d and are \u201crevisiting these decades-long industry standards.\u201d\n\nThe FAA declined to comment.\n\nUltimately, pilots were left in the dark about MCAS because references to the feature were removed from the plane\u2019s manual.\n\nTransportation committee staff also projected an image of a \u201cpreliminary\u201d MCAS alert for the cockpit from 2012. But it was not installed in the planes.\n\nMuilenburg said it was \u201cvery common\u201d to consider such ideas early. Hamilton said the point of the indicator \u201cwas to signal an MCAS failure. It\u2019s important to note that, in these accidents the MCAS system did not fail,\u201d so the indicator would not have lit up. The \u201cfunctionality was incorporated\u201d in another light, he said.\n\nAD\n\nDeFazio said reforms are needed in FAA oversight. Hamilton said the agency has already made adjustments.\n\n\u201cThey are taking lessons learned from these accidents and applying criteria to us that goes above and beyond what the current guidance and regulatory standards are,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cSo I would say we are working to a higher level of standard already.\u201d\n\nAfter the hearing, DeFazio stepped down from the dais and talked with some of the family members. And Nadia Milleron, whose daughter, Samya, died on the Ethiopian Airlines crash, confronted Muilenburg before he left the room.\n\n\u201cI was asking him to be transparent,\u201d she said.", "description": "Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said if \u201cwe knew everything that we know now\u201d the company would have made different decisions on safety.", "authors": ["Ian Duncan", "Member Of The Transportation Team Focused On The U.S. Department Of Transportation", "Michael Laris", "Transportation Reporter", "Lori Aratani", "Reporter Focusing On Transportation Issues", "Including Airports", "Airlines", "The Nation'S Railroad", "Subway Systems"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/WxH4pA_9uKxZo7sZQ-V4RT40h4c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RG6GLYX3HII6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
