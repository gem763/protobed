While Mimo is geared towards more advanced concepts, Google\u2019s new web offering has the potential to set it apart from the other mobile-only players.\n\nRead next: France says hackers might go after supply chains after Airbus cyber assault", "description": "Google is officially bringing its free coding tool\u00a0called Grasshopper\u00a0to desktop web, and introduce two new classes specifically designed for desktop use.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fgrasshopper-hed.png&signature=40237719500ade8f0fdd79b307773acb", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
