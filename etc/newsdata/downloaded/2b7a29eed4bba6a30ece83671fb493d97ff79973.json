But almost unnoticed, another nation has been trying to control what Americans think by censoring free expression at our universities, on the internet, in media and movies, and even by sports clubs: China.\n\nThere are signs, however, that civil society and our leaders are finally fighting back.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon. Beijing is trying to do nothing less than \u201cimpose its speech restrictions on the rest of the world,\u201d as Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg pointed out in an Oct. 17 speech at Georgetown University.\n\nHis embrace of free expression against repressive tendencies in Beijing and here was a breath of fresh air.\n\nChina\u2019s obsessive actions represent nothing less than an attempt by a foreign power to shape the views of a democratic electorate whose opinions, translated through the ballot box and other means, shape public policy.\n\nBeijing gives millions to universities in exchange for silence on its human rights transgressions, forces Hollywood studios to submit their productions to Chinese censors, and buys radio stations here. More recently, it censored what NBA players and executives can say about China, even threatening NBA Commissioner Adam Silver with \u201cretribution sooner or later.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s communist leaders want Americans to be presented with a sanitized picture of a China with no concentration camps for Muslim Uighurs, no repression in Tibet, no violation of promises made to Hong Kong, no repression of dissidents, no denial of freedom of speech or conscience, and no expansion into the South China Seas.\n\nIn other words, an unrealistic picture.\n\nSure, China has come a long way from the crazed chaos under Mao Zedong. The market reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping starting in the late 1970s have given it economic success. But that has not translated into political freedom; China remains a repressive state.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that America resist attempts to introduce its values here.\n\nIn his Georgetown speech, Zuckerberg offered a stark choice.\n\nThe global internet, he predicted, will be operated either with American or Chinese ethics. He vowed to run his company on American values. It amounted to a remarkable turnaround for a man who has seen his company as not really American, but transnational.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Can they do that?", "authors": ["Mike Gonzalez"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HevH9y5Qcw3g5vTOmyl1Sw--~B/aD05NDU7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/beb35ff8696debc940edbd066d6eb080", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
