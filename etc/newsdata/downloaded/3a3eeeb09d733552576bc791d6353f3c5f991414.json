Something screwy is going on in North Carolina,\" Napolitano said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding there is a \"danger to public safety\" when suspected violent criminals are released from custody.\n\nTOP JUDICIARY CMTE REPUBLICAN SLAMS 'PITIFUL' NADLER IMPEACHMENT PUSH\n\nNapolitano said bail is usually not set \"low\" when the case is an alleged \"crime of violence.\" He said when he was a judge in New Jersey it would have been \"inconceivable\" for him not to make sure a suspect freed on bail in his courtroom was turned over to a separate law enforcement agency on other suspected crimes.\n\n\"It would violate my oath to uphold the law.\"\n\nAccording to data obtained by WBTV, 489 detainers were declined by law enforcement across the state of North Carolina since the fiscal year began last October.\n\nMcFadden had come under fire previously for declaring he would not comply with ICE detainers.\n\n'CLERICAL ERROR' BLAMED FOR NC JAIL'S RELEASE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT DETAINED ON MURDER CHARGE\n\nIn one case in Mecklenburg County, an illegal immigrant was freed on bond in a child rape case. The suspect, Oscar Pacheco-Leonardo, was later apprehended by federal authorities, two months after McFadden ignored an ICE detainer order and released him from custody.\n\n\"You may want to ask a judge the question ... on why bonds are set so low, in order for someone to be easily released from the detention center,\" McFadden said Monday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nICE said it issued a detainer a day after the June arrest, but it wasn\u2019t honored and the 33-year-old Honduran national was released on $100,000 bond by the Mecklenburg County Sheriff\u2019s Office. The immigration enforcement agency said Pacheco-Leonardo reentered the U.S. illegally after being deported in 2006.\n\n\u201cThis arrest is simply the latest in a continuing list of unlawfully present foreign nationals released from Mecklenburg County custody over the past nine months despite serious criminal charges that pose a clear threat to public safety,\u201d ICE said in a statement about the case.\n\nFox News' Robert Gearty contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News senior judicial analyst\u00a0Judge Andrew Napolitano responded Tuesday\u00a0to a new report that nearly 500 illegal immigrants have been released from custody in North Carolina over the past 10 months despite\u00a0detainers against them from\u00a0Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/napolitano.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
