Korea seeks to twist U.S. arm in talks with sub-launched ballistic missile test", "language": "en", "text": "North Korea\u2019s test Wednesday of what was believed to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile was a strategic move by Pyongyang to gain an upper hand over the U.S. in nuclear talks slated to restart this weekend after a months-long stall, national security insiders said.\n\nThe test, just hours after the North had announced plans to rejoin working-level nuclear talks with Washington, was likely designed to pressure the U.S. side into an \u201carms control negotiation\u201d rather than the denuclearization discussion sought by the Trump administration, said David Maxwell, a retired U.S. Special Forces officer focused on North Korea.\n\n\u201cIf we shift to an arms control process, Kim wins,\u201d Mr. Maxwell, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, said in comments circulated to reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nOthers were equally wary of Pyongyang\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cIt seems North Korea wants to make its negotiating position quite clear before talks even begin,\u201d said Harry Kazianis, the head of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest in Washington.\n\n\u201cPyongyang, through more tests of what are most likely short-range missiles or advances artillery-style weapons, is eager to remind Washington of its military capabilities \u2014 especially as South Korea just recently displayed its new F-35 stealth fighter purchase,\u201d Mr. Kazianis said.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s message is clear: our capacity to cause trouble is increasing by the day. Pyongyang seems set to push Washington to back off from past demands of full denuclearization for what are only promises of sanctions relief,\u201d he said, also in comments emailed to reporters.\n\nSouth Korean military officials said Wednesday that the North had fired what appeared to be a submarine-launched ballistic missile from waters off its east coast.\n\nThe missile was believed to be a type of Pukguksong, a North Korean SLBM, according to a report by the South\u2019s Yonhap News Agency, which noted that, if confirmed, the launch will mark the Pyongyang\u2019s first SLBM test since August 2016.\n\nThere was no immediate response from the Trump administration and it was not clear how the development may ultimately impact the restart of working-level nuclear talks between U.S. and North Korean officials.\n\nSources have told The Washington Times that U.S. negotiators plan to push their North Korean counterparts for concrete steps toward denuclearization in exchange for limited counter steps by Washington when the two sides meet this weekend for their first working-level talks since February\u2019s failed Hanoi summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\nNorth Korean officials revealed Tuesday in a brief notice in the state official press that the lower-level discussions will resume after a seven-month break, a meeting confirmed shortly afterward by a State Department spokeswoman.\n\nWith the Hanoi talks having collapsed over Mr. Kim\u2019s demand that U.S. deliver sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a partial dismantling of his nuclear arsenal, analysts say the U.S. side is likely to embrace a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to negotiations and see what the North Korean side brings to the table.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
