REUTERS/Phil Noble/Illustration/File Photo\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a last ditch offer to the EU on Wednesday to try to avoid a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 when the two sides are due to part ways.\n\nBut analysts say the market is largely skeptical the EU will agree to Britain\u2019s latest offer and on Thursday EU officials expressed doubt the latest British proposals could yield an agreement before the deadline.\n\nThe pound GBP= has whipsawed since the June 2016 referendum, largely shrugging off increasingly gloomy economic data and instead buffeted by the onslaught of news about how the two sides will end their more than four-decade marriage.\n\nReuters polls of economists in the past three years have consistently said a deal would be struck. If that is the case, sterling - which was changing hands for around $1.24 on Thursday - would rally and trade between $1.27 and $1.34, Friday\u2019s poll said.\n\n\u201cA lot of bad news is priced into the GBP so we would expect a relief rally to some extent, if a deal is reached,\u201d said Shaun Osborne at Scotiabank.\n\nIn contrast, if Britain leaves without a deal the pound will fall and trade between $1.10 and $1.19. Two respondents said it could reach parity with the greenback - a level not seen before.\n\n\u201cSterling would come under severe pressure in a no-deal hard Brexit scenario, given the well documented negative consequences the crash out would have on the economy,\u201d said Conor Beakey at AIB.\n\nMedian forecasts in the wider poll of around 70 foreign exchange strategists, taken this week, said one pound would be worth $1.22 in a month, $1.25 in six months and $1.28 in a year.\n\nWhile that strengthening suggests a deal is most forecasters\u2019 base case scenario it is still a far cry from where sterling was trading at ahead of the vote to leave.\n\nAgainst the euro EURGBP= the one-, six- and 12-month forecasts were for 89.2 pence, 89.5p and 88.0p. Those medians were a touch stronger for sterling than in a September poll.", "description": "Sterling will get a post-Brexit bounce in the month after if Britain leaves the European Union with a deal but suffer further losses against the dollar in the event of a disorderly departure, a Reuters poll found.", "authors": ["Jonathan Cable", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436844493&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9301B"}
