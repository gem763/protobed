Nor was there immediate comment from prosecutors, the German government or Turkey.\n\nThe software, named Finspy, was allegedly deployed on phones of activists in a 2017 protest against mass arrests by President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government in response to a failed coup, the German media said.\n\nIt allowed authorities to access the address books and photo and video stores of the phones, the consortium said.\n\nIn 2018, when the allegations first surfaced in the same media group, the German Economics Ministry said it had not issued a licence to export the software.\n\nThe media outlets said they had seen a deposition from several activist groups, including Reporters without Borders and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, containing an analysis of the software\u2019s source code that they said suggested it was provided by the German company.\n\nThe deposition named five directors of the company and further unspecified employees, they reported.\n\nIn a statement, the NGO groups said they had filed criminal complaints against company officials for exporting the software without a licence. They said the spyware had been planted on a \u201cfake version\u201d of a Turkish opposition website.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous and unacceptable to see German spyware being used against journalists and opposition voices in Turkey,\u201d said Christian Mihr, executive director of Reporters Without Borders Germany.", "description": "German prosecutors are investigating a Bavarian company suspected of supplying software to Turkey allowing authorities to spy on opposition activists via their phones, an investigative media consortium reported on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
