Stefani claimed that \u201cThe N.R.A. exists to spread pro-gun propaganda and put weapons in the hands of those who would harm and terrorize us,\u201d while the N.R.A. rejected this action as nothing more than a publicity stunt, with a spokeswoman stating that \u201cThis is a reckless assault on a law-abiding organization, its members, and the freedoms they all stand for. We remain undeterred by our values and belief in those who want to find real solutions to gun violence.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco is certainly no stranger to criticism from conservatives. Many who opposed this resolution pointed to the multitude of legitimate concerns facing the city, from the human faeces and used needles littering the streets to the city\u2019s refusal to declare that the violent radical organization \u201cAntifa\u201d are themselves a domestic terrorist organization.\n\n\n\nIt is certainly true that San Francisco has a growing problem with the increasingly appalling living conditions created by widespread \u201cprogressive\u201d policies. It is also undeniably true that the failure to declare that Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization is deeply hypocritical. However, any attempt to decry this decision by pointing to other \u201cmore important\u201d problems, or by comparing the N.R.A. to \u201cworse\u201d organizations, is actually counter-productive.\n\nThe fact is that the declaration made by San Francisco is objectively incorrect. This remains true regardless of whether \u201cmore pressing\u201d issues exist, or other organizations are \u201cmore deserving\u201d of this label.\n\nIndeed, by rejecting this declaration by citing other irrelevant factors has the effect of subtly accepting the Left\u2019s premise that the N.R.A. could be defined as a domestic terrorist organization. Sure, the streets of San Francisco are indistinguishable from those of a Third World country, but does that mean that their decision regarding the N.R.A. would be valid if their streets were made of shining marble and gold? Sure, Antifa is arguably a domestic terrorist organization, but does that mean that the N.R.A. is not?\n\nIn reality, the invalidity of this declaration by San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors is self-evidently obvious. According to U.S. law (18 U.S. Code \u00a7?2331)\n\n(5) the term \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d means activities that -\n\nA. involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State;\n\nB. appear to be intended -\n\nto intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n\nto influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or\n\nto affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and\n\nC. occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States; \u2026\n\nIt is safe to assume that many who are celebrating this declaration are not aware (intentionally or otherwise) of the lawful definition of domestic terrorism. Similarly, they are probably unaware of the N.R.A.\u2019s mission, which includes a heavy focus on firearms safety and education. The radical Left capitalize on this pervasive ignorance by driving their quest for political victory through the complete dismissal and redefinition of language, resulting in the recognizable tactic of labeling anyone with whom they disagree as inherently and vehemently evil.\n\nThe fact is that they will continue to rely on this utterly immoral strategy, regardless of the state of the cities under their control or the actions of violent organizations on the Left. The Right must refuse to become distracted by other irrelevant factors, and identify the underlying issue - the Left\u2019s growing stranglehold on our language.\n\nThe N.R.A. is not a domestic terrorist organization. Not because San Francisco is a city sinking beneath the literal feces of Leftist policy. Not because there are arguably \u201cworse\u201d organizations which the Left haven\u2019t condemned. Not because N.R.A. members like you or me don\u2019t self-identify as members of a terrorist organization.\n\nThey are not a domestic terrorist organization because they are not a domestic terrorist organization by the definition of domestic terrorism. It\u2019s that simple.", "description": "The city of San Francisco continued to blur the lines .09/09/2019 19:15:46PM EST.", "authors": ["Ian Haworth", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/71/5a51771e-17fe-497a-8d50-df5d97d5e8b2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
