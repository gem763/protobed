My vocal technique was not very good.\u2019\n\nBob died in August 1999 at the age of 57 in a car accident.\n\nThe Spice Girls reunited this year to perform a set of successful \u2013 and lucrative \u2013 in stadiums around the UK this summer, including a three-night stint at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it was recently reported the group have cancelled their planned Australia tour due to tensions between Geri and Mel B.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Geri and the Spice Girls reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
