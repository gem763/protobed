But here is a compilation of Trump\u2019s hints in the call:\n\n\u201cI would like to have the attorney general call you. \u2026 It\u2019s very important that you do it. \u2026 I will ask him [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. \u2026 If you could speak to him, that would be great. \u2026 If you can look into it [the Biden matter] \u2026 it sounds horrible to me. \u2026 I will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call. \u2026 I\u2019m sure you will figure it out. \u2026 Your economy is going to get better and better, I predict. \u2026 I will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call. \u2026 Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.\u201d\n\nIf that presidential call were set to music, it could be the soundtrack for a \u201cGodfather\u201d movie.\n\nThe Times reports that the acting director of national intelligence and the inspector general for the intelligence community \u2014 each appointed by Trump \u2014 both referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal investigation into the president\u2019s actions.\n\nSurprise! Barr\u2019s Justice Department decided not to pursue the matter.\n\nAs for the assertion that the real corruption is that of Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, that\u2019s false. Ukraine said in May that there was no evidence of illegality by Hunter. I do think that he inappropriately played on his father\u2019s job as vice president to get a board seat with a Ukrainian gas company, just as Trump\u2019s children \u2014 and Trump himself \u2014 have monetized Trump\u2019s presidency. But whatever Hunter\u2019s impropriety, there is zero evidence of misconduct by his father.\n\nJournalists may try to be evenhanded by saying that Trump did this while Biden did that. That is false equivalence. Let\u2019s be clear: Joe Biden appears to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case, while Trump tried to use the power of the federal government and almost $400 million in taxpayer money to coerce Ukraine into meddling in a U.S. election.\n\nFresh from allegations of collusion with Russia to win the 2016 election, Trump turns out to have been trying to collude with Ukraine to arrange foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry will now unfold, and there\u2019s no reason to prejudge the outcome or rush the process. Let the evidence emerge and be debated.\n\nNo one should be gleeful, for an impeachment process is a trauma for our country \u2014 and I\u2019m not sure that Democrats living in blue bubbles appreciate the risk that this process may end up helping Republican candidates.\n\nBut put politics aside.\n\nTrump weaponized taxpayer dollars to coerce a foreign leader to target U.S. citizens with a criminal investigation, aiming to affect an American presidential election. Whether or not you believe that is impeachable, we should be able to agree that it is unconscionable.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
