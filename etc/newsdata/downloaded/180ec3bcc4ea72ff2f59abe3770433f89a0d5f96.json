Biden and Warren\u2019s core disagreement centers on how hard the next president should push to fundamentally restructure the American economy. Warren has called for \u201cbig structural change\u201d; Biden promises a return to normalcy.\n\nTo really understand this schism, you must consider the 36 years that then-Sen. Biden spent defending the uniquely pro-corporate laws of his home state, Delaware \u2014 laws that protect America\u2019s biggest companies from taxes, lawsuits and accountability; fuel economic inequality; and prioritize the interests of shareholders over those of consumers, debtors and workers.\n\nThe system Biden protected affects every American: Because so many companies are registered there, Delaware is effectively the principal author and enforcer of much of the nation\u2019s corporate law. The state boasts more corporate registrations than human residents, including two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies. Delaware is corporate America\u2019s home base.\n\nLike Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 attacks on the \u201crigged economy,\u201d Warren\u2019s calls for change represent a direct challenge to Delaware\u2019s special status. By taking on three key policies that have made Delaware into the corporate paradise it is today, the Massachusetts senator is calling much of Biden\u2019s record into question.\n\nWarren\u2019s first and biggest target is the notion of shareholder primacy: the idea that corporate managers\u2019 most important legal duty is to maximize shareholders\u2019 wealth. That means the interests of workers, families, local communities and the environment are of secondary importance to executives and board members.\n\n\u201cThat is in part a function of Delaware corporate law,\u201d said Kent Greenfield, a corporate and constitutional law professor at Boston College. Under Delaware law \u2014 which covers all those companies registered in the state \u2015 shareholders must come first.\n\nIn effect, Delaware corporate law encourages companies to undercut employee pay and ship jobs overseas in order to enrich shareholders. And it locks out other stakeholders, like workers and consumers, from being considered in the corporate decision-making process.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2016, Warren noted last year, \u201clarge American companies dedicated 93% of their earnings to shareholders.\u201d\n\nThis has other real-world consequences. When President Donald Trump pushed a massive corporate tax cut through Congress in 2017, for example, much of that money was returned to shareholders, rather than workers or other stakeholders.\n\nAs vice president, Biden criticized shareholder primacy, saying in 2016 that corporations should \u201cembrace your obligation to workers as well as your shareholders.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the competition between states to develop the most business-friendly corporate charters \u2015 the competition that Delaware won \u2015 that effectively ensures shareholder primacy across the nation. And the last time Congress moved to end that competition in the 1970s, Sen. Biden swooped in to defend Delaware\u2019s position.\n\nIn the wake of a succession of corporate scandals and bankruptcies, the Senate held a series of hearings to examine whether the federal government, instead of the states, should issue corporate charters for large companies. These hearings were anathema to Delaware\u2019s politicians and business community. The state was then, as now, the national leader in corporate registrations. Fees from business registrations were, and still are, a major source of funding for the state government. (Today, they account for more than one-quarter of the state\u2019s income.) Federalizing corporate charters would also cut profits for the state\u2019s lawyers, accountants and corporate registration companies.\n\nAs Congress mulled a possible change, Biden appeared before two different committees to vouch for prominent Delaware lawyers who were there to argue against nationalizing corporate charters and for preserving Delaware\u2019s special position. At one hearing, he suggested that senators not attending should \u201ctake the time\u201d to review the lawyers\u2019 testimony \u201cbefore they make final decisions.\u201d Before another hearing, he praised the witness: \u201cHis judgment on these matters is also pretty sharp.\u201d\n\nBiden and Delaware won: Congress never moved to have the federal government take over issuing big corporate charters. The hearings fizzled out after Ronald Reagan took the White House and Republicans won the Senate in 1980.\n\nNow progressives like Sanders and Warren are trying again. In 2018, Warren introduced legislation to federalize the top tier of corporate charters and thereby take away Delaware\u2019s special place as the national writer of corporate law. Warren\u2019s bill would require corporations with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to obtain a federal corporate charter that would require them to consider the needs of a broader array of stakeholders \u2014 employees, local communities, suppliers, the environment \u2014 when making decisions rather than solely focusing on the concerns of shareholders.\n\n\u201cThe role that Delaware plays in determining our system of corporate governance is also, in that sense, going to be in play in the coming campaign,\u201d said Robert Hockett, a Cornell Law School professor who advises Warren, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\nBiden And Warren Clash, Round 1\n\nFrom 1999 through 2005, Sen. Biden was the leading Democratic supporter of bankruptcy reform legislation in the Senate. (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS) More\n\nThe second aspect of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have taken aim at is its credit card industry, which Biden boosted by making it harder for Americans to discharge credit card debt in bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1981, Delaware state lawmakers, at the behest of Republican Gov. Pete du Pont, passed a sweeping financial deregulation bill designed to attract banks to the state. The bill, written by lobbyists for Chase Manhattan Bank and J.P. Morgan (then two separate companies), eliminated the state\u2019s interest rate caps and gave special tax treatment to financial institutions. Months after the legislation passed, MBNA Corporation, one of the largest credit card issuers in the country, relocated from Maryland to Delaware.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Biden and the rest of Delaware\u2019s congressional delegation worked hard to protect MBNA and the other financial institutions that flocked to their state.\n\nOne big problem for credit card issuers was federal bankruptcy law. As the credit card industry exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of Americans filed for personal bankruptcy protection \u2015 a legal process that allows individuals to prioritize what debts they can pay off and start anew with less debt than before.\n\nCreditors, including the credit card industry, banks and retailers, argued that people were taking advantage of the process to discharge debt they could otherwise pay. These businesses wanted the debts owed to them to be higher priority and harder to discharge.\n\nOn the other side were academics led by Warren, then a Harvard Law School professor. Warren\u2019s research found that people filing for personal bankruptcy were generally dealing with a stroke of bad luck. They had a major medical expense, a messy divorce or a lost job. (Some of this research was \u2014 and remains \u2014 controversial.) And women made up a major proportion of those declaring bankruptcy. Warren argued that the system was a last-ditch safety net for hardworking people.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the credit card industry funded a massive lobbying campaign to pass federal legislation to make it harder to discharge credit card debt in personal bankruptcy. They hired President Bill Clinton\u2019s former Treasury secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, and funded multiple questionable studies to back up their argument that fraud was causing the spike in bankruptcies.\n\nAt the same time, Congress created a National Bankruptcy Review Commission to study the problem. The commission, which Warren served as reporter and senior adviser, mainly sided with the academics against the credit card industry. But the industry\u2019s lobbying campaign won out.\n\nThe first legislation to change the bankruptcy process in favor of creditors was pushed through the House in 1997. It went through four separate iterations before ultimately becoming law in 2005. Republicans generally backed the bills while the majority of Democrats opposed them.\n\nThat first bill passed the Senate too and almost became law \u2015 until Biden reportedly threatened to filibuster the measure because the House had made it too friendly to creditors in conference committee. Nonetheless, he had initially voted for that bill, and afterward, he took the reins as the main Democratic voice in favor of rewriting bankruptcy law.\n\nNews reports at the time referred to Biden as \u201cthe linchpin to passage,\u201d \u201cthe only Democratic true believer\u201d and \u201cpossibly the bankruptcy bill\u2019s staunchest defender.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, President Clinton pocket-vetoed another version of the bill on the advice of first lady Hillary Clinton, whom Warren had convinced to oppose the measure. A Democratic amendment that would have prevented abortion opponents from using bankruptcy to discharge legal debt stemming from their participation in violent protests killed the 2001 bill. Finally, with a bigger Republican majority in 2005, Congress passed a bill that was signed into law by President George W. Bush. Biden was one of a minority of Senate Democrats who voted for the legislation all four times.\n\nWarren, pictured in 2001 when she was a Harvard Law School professor, was a leading opponent of the bankruptcy bills championed by Biden. (Photo: Boston Globe via Getty Images) More\n\nToday, Biden claims that his support was part of an effort to improve legislation that was ultimately going to pass with or without him. As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2005, he saw it as his job to work with Republicans and Democrats to solve the issue of rising personal bankruptcies. Through his actions, he helped to protect lower-income debtors, prioritize alimony and child support payments, and increase credit card disclosure, according to the Biden campaign. The former vice president has \u201cchampioned the middle class for his entire career and has a proven track record of delivering on his progressive values,\u201d said Mike Gwin, a Biden campaign spokesman.\n\nBut though he showed some distaste for creditors\u2019 goals, Biden believed the bill was necessary and tried time and time again to pass it. He shoehorned the measure into a foreign affairs bill to get it before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he was ranking member, in 2000. He cast the deciding and only Democratic vote in a 10-8 split supporting the bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2001.\n\n\u201cI am so sick of this self-righteous sheen put on anybody who wants to tighten up bankruptcy [who] is [painted as] really anti-debtor,\u201d Biden said at a 2001 hearing. \u201cPeople are getting hurt.\u201d\n\nOver the years, he voted against numerous consumer-friendly amendments offered by his Democratic colleagues that would have eased the bill\u2019s new requirements for consumers filing bankruptcy over medical debts or debts incurred while on active-duty military service. He opposed other amendments that would have put caps on credit card interest rates and penalized mortgage lenders if they had broken the Truth in Lending Act when they extended credit.\n\n\u201cSome of these looked like they were sympathetic to people with real issues, but they were not good public policy solutions,\u201d a former Biden Senate aide said.\n\nThrough the many iterations of the bankruptcy bill, Warren emerged as its fiercest outside opponent. And she directly took on Biden.\n\nLove HuffPost? Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today.\n\nThe year after the 2001 bill failed, Warren wrote a 39-page article in the Harvard Women\u2019s Law Journal arguing that politicians like Biden should be forced to pay a political price for supporting economic legislation that hurts women. Biden\u2019s assertion that he made the bill prioritize women was misleading, Warren argued.\n\nBiden said he moved alimony and child support up the list of priorities for payment when a person entered personal bankruptcy. Child support services professionals backed his proposal, arguing that it would \u201crevolutionize the enforcement of support obligations against debtors in bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nBut Warren wrote that this move was simply a sleight-of-hand, pushing alimony and child support payments above priorities that only came into play in business-related bankruptcies. The practical effects of the proposed change, she wrote, \u201cwould be either nonexistent or detrimental.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, the latest bill\u2019s restrictions on personal bankruptcy would fall hardest on women because it was women who made up the majority of bankruptcy filings, Warren argued. \u201cFor a million women who will go to the bankruptcy courts each year, there is no more important pending federal legislation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMajor women\u2019s rights organizations, including the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the National Women\u2019s Law Center, opposed the bill for the same reason.\n\nWarren and Biden finally came face to face at a Senate hearing on bankruptcy in 2005. In a now-famous exchange, he back-handedly complimented her for making \u201ca very compelling and mildly demagogic argument.\u201d He suggested she was targeting the wrong credit card problem by opposing the bankruptcy bill.\n\n\u201cYour problem with credit card companies is usury rates from your position,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt is not about the bankruptcy bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Senator, if you are not going to fix that problem, you can\u2019t take away the last shred of protection from these families,\u201d Warren replied.\n\n\u201cI got it, OK. You are very good, Professor,\u201d Biden said to laughs from Warren and the audience.\n\nThe 2005 law did reduce the personal bankruptcy filing rate. But studies indicate the law made it harder for the country to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis, led to 250,000 additional home foreclosures and drove a 25% increase in persistent insolvency.\n\nThe pro-creditor status quo might not last forever \u2014 especially if Sanders or Warren wins the presidential election and the Democrats retake control of the Senate. The Sanders campaign announced on Sept. 5 that it would introduce a proposal to roll back parts of the 2005 law to help those with heavy medical debts. The Warren campaign has yet to release any bankruptcy-related reforms.\n\nThe Place To Go Bankrupt\n\nEmployees remove their belongings from Enron's corporate headquarters after being laid off due to the company's collapse. (Photo: Gregory Smith via Getty Images) More\n\nThe third pillar of the Delaware system that Sanders and Warren have challenged are the laws that make it a favorite place for companies to file for bankruptcy. Biden, again, has been on the other side.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Enron, an energy services firm, collapsed amid a massive corruption scandal. John Cornyn, then attorney general of Texas, pushed the company to file for bankruptcy in Houston, where it was based and where it employed 7,500 people. Instead, Enron filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan, where one of its subsidiaries was incorporated and it employed 57 people. This was possible because U.S. law allows corporations to file in any state in which they or their subsidiaries are incorporated.\n\nIn other words, companies can venue or forum shop, effectively choosing the jurisdiction most favorable to their interests in bankruptcy. And there are two favorite venues: Delaware and New York. The Los Angeles Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. General Motors, famously of Detroit, filed for bankruptcy in Manhattan.\n\nThere is a longstanding debate in the world of corporate bankruptcy law about whether venue shopping is a problem. Some contend it makes sense to let companies go to Manhattan and Delaware where the judges have greater experience in handling large, complicated bankruptcies. But others, like Warren, argue that venue shopping allows corporations to pick their judges while creating steep burdens for employees, pensioners and other small creditors to attend out-of-town proceedings and pay the higher legal fees charged in both Delaware and Manhattan.\n\nThat\u2019s what Enron\u2019s employees argued. And it was why now-Sen. Cornyn, with Warren\u2019s help, authored an amendment to the 2005 bankruptcy reform bill to ban venue shopping. At that same committee hearing, he asked her to explain her concerns about the practice.\n\n\u201cIn the case of large corporations that can leave their home venue \u2015 Enron, who can leave Houston, Texas, where its employees, where its pensioners, where its trade creditors reside \u2015 and escape the obligation to make the process open to the thousands of people who are directly affected by the bankruptcy, that affects the bankruptcy system overall,\u201d Warren said. \u201cA fair bankruptcy system is one that retains access for the employees, for the pensioners, for the small creditors, and that means those cases need to stay home, not go to a distant location where they [the corporations] think they may get a better deal.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s comment \u2015 that corporations could \u201cescape the obligation to make the process open\u201d \u2015 angered Biden.\n\n\u201cI find it outrageous such a statement,\u201d Biden said before asking Warren if she thought Delaware courts weren\u2019t open.\n\nDelaware\u2019s dominance in corporate bankruptcy cases is a side effect of its dominance in corporate charter registration. It\u2019s also a huge cash cow for local businesses from law firms to hotels to restaurants. But to critics like Warren, it makes it easier for the little people to get screwed.\n\n\u201cEmployees of companies like Enron literally cannot go to Delaware and hire local counsel, which the Delaware bankruptcy court requires them [to do] before they can make an appearance, and that effectively cuts thousands of small employees, pensioners and local trade creditors out of the bankruptcy process,\u201d Warren tried to explain to Biden. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford it, they are not there.\u201d\n\nBefore moving on, Biden declared that Cornyn\u2019s amendment was going nowhere. Biden and his fellow Delaware senator, Tom Carper, threatened to withhold their votes from the bankruptcy bill if the venue shopping amendment was attached. Cornyn withdrew it under pressure from Republican leadership in order to placate the two Democrats.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time Biden had quashed an effort to stop venue shopping in corporate bankruptcy. \u201cMost of these proposals were to remove an industry Delaware had built up and to get a piece of the action for themselves,\u201d the former Biden Senate aide said.\n\n\u201cAs long as Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware is in the Senate,\u201d any possibility of venue shopping reform is \u201cnonexistent,\u201d Brady Williamson, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission\u2019s chairman, observed in 2006.\n\nWhen Warren won election to the Senate in 2012, she joined Cornyn as the Democratic co-sponsor on legislation to ban venue shopping. But the bill hasn\u2019t moved in the Senate even though Biden is gone. Delaware\u2019s current Democratic senators \u2015 Carper and Chris Coons \u2015 have taken his place as its biggest opponents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another one of these \u2018what\u2019s good for Delaware and to hell with the nation,\u2019\u201d said Adam Levitin, a bankruptcy law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nThe Coming Debate\n\nIt\u2019s no big surprise when senators promote their home state\u2019s business interests. \u201cI take it very personally when my colleague or a colleague in the Senate decides to take an action that would benefit his state only marginally but would do great damage to my state,\u201d Biden said in 2004. \u201cI take that very personally.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s competitors for the Democratic presidential nomination have done it too. Sanders has supported stationing F-35 jets in Vermont, bringing jobs and dollars to his state. Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), whose states are both home to big medical device manufacturers, endorsed a bill to repeal the medical device tax included in the Affordable Care Act. And Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), whose state is home to numerous pharmaceutical companies, voted against a proposal to lower drug prices.\n\nWhat has made Biden\u2019s parochialism so significant is that his state\u2019s special interests are central to the structure of the U.S. \u2014 and global \u2014 economy. By putting his state first, Biden helped to build and protect the economic structure that Warren and Sanders blame for a wide range of Americans\u2019 troubles. That is what the coming debates will be about.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Biden voted against a 2005 amendment to bar wealthy bankruptcy filers from hiding assets in special asset protection trusts. He voted for it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on HuffPost.", "description": "For 36 years, the former senator defended his home state's pro-corporate policies, which Democratic rivals now want to end.", "authors": ["Paul Blumenthal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_gSr4OGrDhW39.VvMMruVA--~B/aD0yNTM3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d727ba93b0000ea55d0c03e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
