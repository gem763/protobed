Despite originating from the Chromium project, Mozilla decided to support the API a few years back, as part of a feature-parity push, and to allow add-on developers to write extensions that work across all major browsers.\n\nLast year, Google engineers, who effectively control the Chromim project by their sheer numbers, decided to start work on an update to the WebExtensions API, named Manifest V3.\n\nThese planned updates didn't go down very well with both users and extension developers, the latter of which pointed out that the changes would impact the ability of many add-ons to do their job, and especially ad blockers.\n\nSince Google's main source of revenue is online advertising, well, you can imagine the criticism and conspiracy theories Google has been facing for the past eight months.\n\nFirefox will keep webRequest blocking feature\n\nNow, in a blog post today, Mozilla said it would not be following Google's WebExtensions API update to the letter, and that it would make some changes of its own.\n\nThe browser maker said it would not remove the \"blocking webRequest\" mechanism that ad blockers and other extensions use to inspect and block certain web page resources from loading.\n\nMozilla isn't yet sure on the specifics of the technical solution they'll implement, but they said they'll meet with add-on developers to discuss the best plan forward.\n\nFirst Firefox versions that will support the new WebExtensions API (Manifest) v3, including the old webRequest mechanism, will be available for testing later this year.\n\nOther browser vendors made a similar decision\n\nMozilla's decision is in tune with what other browser makers have also said they'll do about the upcoming WebExtensions API (Manifest) v3. Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi announced similar plans to preserve or port the webRequest feature from v2 to v3, back in June.\n\nMicrosoft, which recently began creating a Chromium-based version of its Edge browser, has not made any public statements about how it will implement the new WebExtensions API v3.\n\nUntil now, Google backtracked on some of the WebExtensions API (Manifest) v3 changes twice, in February and June, but ad blocker developers still claim their extensions won't work as efficiently as before, despite Google's recent trade-offs.", "description": "Like Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi, Mozilla distances itself from Google's planned extensions update that is anticipated to hinder ad blockers in Chrome.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/03/8d840cf9-8547-43f0-a78f-1774c52bf199/thumbnail/770x578/5f25118c3558fb20eb4c11db58ee419c/mozilla-try-out-our-new-fenixbased-firef-5d1b6131dd173300c3ac83fd-1-jul-03-2019-20-42-49-poster.jpg"}
