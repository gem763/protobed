U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres bluntly told nations to \"come with concrete plans\" to ramp up commitments to slash greenhouse gases and achieve net zero carbon emissions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who wants to pull the United States out of the ratified 2015 Paris agreement to cut emissions, won't participate, but United Nations officials and observers say China and about 70 other countries could make big announcements. At least another 40 countries are expected to attend, and might \u2014 or might not \u2014 end up on stage making new pledges.\n\n\"Monday is the big show, with heads of states from around the world (meeting) in order for them to collectively raise ambition on the climate agenda,\" Cassie Flynn, U.N. Development Programme strategic advisor on climate change, said at a U.N. Foundation briefing.\n\nOn Sunday, 130 banks holding $47 trillion in assets committed to climate action and sustainability, according to U.N. environment officials. Coalitions of cities and states as well as industry groups are expected to make pledges during the summit as well.\n\nProtesters march through Brussels with placards as they take part in a Global Climate Strike demonstration on September 20, 2019, in Brussels, Belgium. More\n\nA new U.N. science report released Sunday shows that emissions into the Earth's atmosphere continue to surge, G-20 nations responsible for 80% of emissions are failing to meet their already low targets, and countries overall must triple their 2015 pledges to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0 F) by 2100, or increase them fivefold to hold it to 1.5\u00b0C, a threshold seen as critical to the survival of small, low-lying countries. Researchers predict fiercer hurricanes, heat waves, droughts, floods and related food scarcity and health impacts if significant action isn't taken.\n\nThe summit comes on the heels of a worldwide Youth Climate Strike on Friday, during which millions of young people demanded faster action to address the climate crisis, and a Saturday Youth Climate Action Summit at the United Nations.\n\nNEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 26: People walk past the United Nations headquarters on September 26, 2018 in New York City.

But it wasn't clear Sunday how successful Guterres had been in his efforts to wrangle nations to make deep emissions cuts and other serious pledges.\n\n\"China is the one to watch,\" said David Waskow, director of the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute.\n\nIn terms of the finance industry, on Sunday the banks \"commit(ted) to strategically align their business with the goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sustainable Development Goals, and massively scale up their contribution to the achievement of both,\" a U.N. statement said.", "description": "With rising protests on climate change, nations will reveal if they'll commit to deep emissions cuts. 130 banks pledged Sunday to join the effort.", "authors": ["Janet Wilson", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IIjXYXf9WfOLr9A_OiTWYg--~B/aD00NDA0O3c9NjYwNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/507876c727e0eca93e8c6f9df4a68c1d", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
