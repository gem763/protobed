Normally he sets up an agenda, like migration, and then controls its communication,\u201d Istvan Bart, an expert with Hungarian NGO Energia Klub, told AFP.\n\n\u201cOn climate (the government) is running behind events and trying to catch up.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Bargaining chip \u2013\n\nHungary was one of the first EU countries to ratify the Paris Climate Accord, but Orban downgraded environmental protection soon after he came to power in 2010.\n\nOrban \u2014 popular at home for his hard line on migration \u2014 stoked further scepticism in June when he along with Poland and the Czech Republic vetoed a joint EU declaration on bloc-wide carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nMeeting French President Emmanuel Macron, a defender of the 2050 goal, on Friday, Orban insisted his country was \u201ca climate champion\u201d, citing its low per capita carbon emissions compared with most other European countries.\n\nThe EU still hopes to convince Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to support the carbon neutrality goal, which needs the okay from all EU members to be adopted.\n\nOrban has insisted that Brussels \u2014 rather than Hungarian families slapped with higher utility bills \u2014 should pay for de-carbonising economies in poorer eastern member states.\n\nAlthough Hungary is less coal dependent than its neighbours, Orban\u2019s veto was \u201cabout showing Central European solidarity,\u201d said Agoston Mraz, an analyst at Hungary\u2019s Nezopont Institute.\n\nThe veto also gives Budapest a bargaining chip during ongoing tough budget negotiations with Brussels, according to Benedek Javor, a former Hungarian green MEP.\n\nHungary faces potentially a 25 percent slash in EU development funding during 2021-2027 from the previous seven-year period.\n\n\u201cFor Orban, climate change is about getting money,\u201d Javor said. \u201cLess ambitious climate goals now can be leveraged to get more cash later.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Postponing real climate action\u2019 \u2013\n\nLast month, Orban dismissed as \u201cpure nonsense\u201d the \u201cgreen argument\u201d that having more children impacted climate change.\n\n\u201cFor now, the government tries to portray that the extremist opposition want to radically change the Hungarians\u2019 way of life, while it is taking realistic steps,\u201d Bart said.\n\nAt a recent UN climate summit in New York Orban\u2019s loyal ally President Janos Ader pledged that by 2030 Hungary will boost its solar energy capacity tenfold, phase out coal-based energy, and ramp up nuclear energy.\n\nUnimpressed critics noted that Ader has no executive power to implement the measures.\n\nBernadett Szel, a prominent green politician, said the president was being used as a \u201cgreen shield\u201d by Orban to deflect climate criticism.\n\n\u201cOrban is part of a network of irresponsible politicians like (US President) Donald Trump and (Brazilian President) Jair Bolsonaro who are responsible for postponing real climate action,\u201d she said.\n\nBusiness and political interests in Orban\u2019s orbit are paramount, observers say. Well-connected businessmen who dominate the solar panel sector would benefit from the New York pledge.\n\n\u201cBut if it\u2019s not oligarch-friendly it doesn\u2019t get done in Hungary,\u201d Bart said. \u201cAnd climate doesn\u2019t care who owns solar panels.\u201d\n\nMore controversial is Hungary\u2019s commitment to the expensive Russian-backed extension to the nuclear plant at Paks south of Budapest, Hungary\u2019s biggest power utility.\n\nThe government says carbon neutrality by 2050 and low household utility bills are only possible with nuclear energy.\n\nBut critics like Javor, wary of Orban\u2019s links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, call Paks \u201ca political rather than an energy project\u201d.\n\n\u201c(Orban) doesn\u2019t want competition for electricity from Paks, but that may change as oligarchs can gain shares of other energy sectors like wind. (Orban\u2019s party) Fidesz is nothing if not pragmatic,\u201d Javor said.", "description": "Budapest (AFP) \u2013 As Hungarians increasingly fret about climate change, right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban is facing growing heat over the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/e4f285_85-percent-hungarians-now-climate-change-is-problem-hungary-orban-faces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
