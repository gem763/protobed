The price gains pushed up the headline consumer-inflation rate by more than a percentage point last month, the statistics bureau said.\n\nThe rise in pork prices is likely to continue until at least the middle of next year given the shrinking sow population, said Lin Shu, an analyst with China Merchants Securities.\n\nSome local governments are providing subsidies to consumers in an effort to stabilize prices before celebrations marking the 70th National Day\u2014China\u2019s equivalent of Independence Day in the U.S.\u2014begin Oct. 1. Also, Beijing has lifted restrictions on small-scale pig farming this year and ordered local governments to stop demolishing small farms.\n\nFang Yin, a resident in Putian, a city in the southeastern province of Fujian, said that while she welcomes the government\u2019s efforts, the subsidy is inadequate given the steep rise in pork prices. Earlier this month, Putian started offering each resident a subsidy of 4 yuan ($0.56) a kilogram for up to 2 kilograms (about 4\u00bd pounds) of pork at two government-designated markets.\n\nAfrican swine fever began to strike Chinese farms in 2018 and hog-price increases accelerated in 2019 as the outbreaks\u2014and the supply shortage\u2014worsened. It is unlikely that imports alone will be able to offset the shortfall, Mr. Lin said. China is the world\u2019s largest consumer and producer of pork.\n\nHowever, economists said the jump in pork prices won\u2019t be a barrier to further monetary easing, as prices of nonfood items remained soft last month and China\u2019s economic growth has continued to slow this year, according to official data.\n\nLast week, the central bank cut banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio, freeing up an additional $126 billion for lending. The People\u2019s Bank of China \u201cis still likely to lower a key interest rate in September that could indirectly lower funding costs for businesses amid an economic slowdown,\u201d Mr. Lin said.\n\nChina\u2019s core consumer-inflation rate, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slipped to a three-year low of 1.5% in August, reflecting sluggish domestic demand.\n\nThe producer-price inflation rate last month fell further into deflationary territory, down 0.8% from a year earlier, piling pressure on manufacturers that have been struggling with declining orders as the U.S.-China trade war intensified.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the producer-end deflation and easing nonfood prices all point to slowing economic-growth momentum and weakening demand,\u201d said Ning Zhang, an economist at UBS.\n\n\u2014Grace Zhu and Liyan Qi", "description": "China\u2019s consumer inflation rate kept up an accelerated pace in August as the price of pork, a mainstay of the Chinese diet, rose at its fastest clip in eight years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-105541/social", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
