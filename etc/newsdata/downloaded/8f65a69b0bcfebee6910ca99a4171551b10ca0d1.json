Ramirez, a former Yale classmate of Kavanaugh's, claims that he exposed himself to her at a college party in the 1980s. Kavanaugh had already faced down sexual assault allegations from a woman named Christine Blasey Ford during his confirmation hearing last fall. He vehemently denied her accusations and was eventually - narrowly - confirmed.\n\nDemocrats are calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment after this latest allegation in The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, despite Pogrebin and Kelly's anonymous sourcing and the questionable \"witnesses\" they introduce to us. The Washington Examiner's Byron York sought out exactly what these sources supposedly saw or heard, and found much to be desired. One of the key witnesses was Ramirez's mother, who admits that her daughter did not tell her the whole story, but she knows that \"something happened at Yale.\" Kenneth Appold, Kavanaugh's former Yale suitemate, didn't see the incident, but heard about it a few days later.\n\n\"Appold said an eyewitness told him the story and that he believes it is true because what he heard matches Ramirez's account even though Appold has never spoken to her,\" York notes.\n\nThe accounts of the other five supposed witnesses are just as suspicious.\n\nMollie Hemingway, who co-authored the well researched Justice on Trial with Judicial Crisis Network's Carrie Severino, shared York's summary of these key \"witnesses.\"\n\nNew Kavanaugh book claims seven people back up Deborah Ramirez allegation. That\u2019s when things get a bit silly. https://t.co/vlkZTPxYG4 pic.twitter.com/pIsL5XxAws \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nThe Education of Brett Kavanaugh does not do the Associate Justice many favors, nor does it do much educating, but Pogrebin and Kelly insist part of their goal in publishing it was to put themselves in Kavanaugh's shoes. They noted in a \"TODAY\" interview that he has turned his life around and has lived an exemplary life as an adult.\n\nThe book officially comes out today.", "description": ".09/17/2019 19:19:51PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/292/e2c614f7-f69f-49b6-b3c0-ec403ec69280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
