He said he was acting in self-defence, and was found not guilty of murder or manslaughter, but was given a 16-month detention and training order for carrying a knife and perverting the course of justice.\n\nHis mother Stephanie said her son \u201cfully accepts responsibility\u201d for his friend\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cCircumstances on the night of March 2 led to our son Joshua accidentally killing his friend Yousef with a knife whilst defending himself against a knife,\u201d Ms Molnar said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe events of that night were a tragedy. These were three friends going out on a Saturday. They should all still be here to lead fulfilling lives but they are not. I cannot imagine what Yousef\u2019s parents and family must be going through ... Joshua fully accepts responsibility for Yousef\u2019s death in the act of self-defence and the impact of this acceptance is massive.\n\n\u201cHe will have to live with the responsibility ... for the rest of his life. We are also acutely aware that the hurt and loss that Yousef\u2019s family is experiencing are infinitely greater than anything we are going through and nothing I can say can make up for or change that.\u201d", "description": "A schoolboy who killed his friend with a knife must live with the responsibility for the rest of his life, his mother said as she agreed for him to be named for the first time.", "authors": ["Jamie Johnson", "David Trimble", "Roderick Crawford", "Stephen Barclay"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000211992554-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqplzA8KxgFtNV7wUO3CkgAZ0dkJLB9RpoxXW6vlZDiUA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
