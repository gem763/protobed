Howell, an Obama appointee, said last week it was fair for the Democrats to have all relevant material to the special counsel\u2019s probe into the Trump campaign and alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election for their impeachment inquiry.\n\nShe said the Justice Department\u2019s argument that existing law bars the release of grand jury material is \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn carrying out the weighty constitutional duty of determining whether impeachment of the President is warranted, Congress need not redo the nearly two years of effort spent on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, nor risk being misled by witnesses, who may have provided information to the grand jury and the Special Counsel,\u201d Judge Howell wrote in the original court order.\n\nBut the circuit court clerk\u2019s order Tuesday put that decision on hold \u2014 at least for now. The clerk said parties should continue briefing the issue through Nov. 5.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
