AKJ Aesthetics also offered a \u201cKylie package\u201d as a competition prize, which the ASA ruled was irresponsible.\n\n\u201cWe considered that consumers would therefore understand from the ads that they could achieve similar results to those of Kylie Jenner and that the photos accurately represented what could generally be achieved through use of the advertised cosmetic procedures,\u201d the ASA said.\n\n\u201cTherefore we expected to see that the person in the ad, Kylie Jenner, had used those products and the ad was a realistic depiction of what the products could achieve.\u201d\n\nThe ASA banned the ads and told AKJ Aesthetics and Queen of Aesthetics not to use celebrities in ads if they had not used their products.\n\nThe ASA also banned a third Instagram beauty ad, run by Beauty Boutique Aesthetics, featuring another member of the clan, Kim Kardashian, for promoting Botox. It is against the UK advertising code to market prescription-only medicines.\n\nEarlier this month, Instagram said it will start hiding promotions for cosmetic surgery and other diet products from under 18s. Last year, Kim Kardashian, who has 148 million Instagram followers, was criticised for promoting an appetite-suppressing lollipop on her account.\n\nKylie Jenner has huge social media clout and a cult following. A tweet last year in which she asked her 28 million Twitter followers \u201cdoes anyone else not open Snapchat any more?\u201d wiped $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) off the company\u2019s stock market value.\n\nEarlier this year, Forbes named then 21-year-old Jenner the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire, beating Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg by two years. She built a makeup empire from Kylie Cosmetics, which she runs largely from her iPhone with the help of her mother Kris.", "description": "Beauty salons AKJ Aesthetics and Queen of Aesthetics used images celebrity to promote \u2018filler package\u2019", "authors": ["Mark Sweney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da233e9012e20fe143ebe53bb1d95c1efa7330b/0_0_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4bdf4d302e538c383c88a45d7d92a942", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
