Obviously, Race to Dubai, if I get into position coming into the last three (events), you go for gold, don\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nWorld number 31 Fitzpatrick started the round with a one-shot lead but looked in danger of slipping adrift after 10 holes in Rome. Instead, he remains in control as he bids for a sixth European Tour title.\n\nHis compatriot Matt Wallace and Austria\u2019s Bernd Wiesberger remain in contention, just three shots behind on 10-under.\n\nIt was a horrible day, though, for Justin Rose, as the former world number one plummeted down the leaderboard with a seven-over 78 in which he failed to make a single birdie.\n\nRose, who was only three shots back overnight, is now 13 off the pace and tied for 51st.", "description": "Rome (AFP) \u2013 Matthew Fitzpatrick birdied four of his final six holes on Saturday to hold onto a one-shot lead at the Italian Open heading into the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/0565b5_fitzpatrick-is-aiming-sixth-european-tour-win-fitzpatrick-maintains-one-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
