Vice-President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez presented coordinates for what she described as camps inside Colombia where \u201cterrorists\u201d were plotting against Venezuela.\n\nBut the local website Colombia Reports found that two of the coordinates were locations in the Caribbean sea, while the third appeared to be the front yard of a house in the Colombian city of Maicao.", "description": "Gen Oswaldo Pe\u00f1a stresses \u2018need to take responsibility\u2019 after President Iv\u00e1n Duque brandished file during UN address", "authors": ["Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fe70579e70b72d786de26a0a0897a2dac500f2/0_65_1986_1192/master/1986.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=97433edd4c2242c939d80bad8a2806cb", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
