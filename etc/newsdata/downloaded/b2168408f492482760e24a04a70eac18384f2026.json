Photo-Illustration: by Preeti Kinha; Photos: Getty Images\n\nEarly Thursday morning, communication planet Mercury enters inquisitive Scorpio. You might feel yourself becoming more sharply observant, your thoughts and your words more honest, more intense. This transit might offer you the focus you need for getting to the bottom of things, and the courage to speak the truth. Then, early on Friday morning, aggression planet Mars enters charming and tactful Libra: No matter how clear the truth is, no matter how clearly you see the world\u2019s darkness, it might be difficult to take aggressive action. You may find yourself choosing diplomacy and charm instead.\n\nAries Weekly Horoscope\n\nIf your body wants to slow down a little bit this week, let it. This is a week to remind yourself that you\u2019re just doing the best that you can. You don\u2019t have to operate at full capacity all the time. You don\u2019t have to rush headlong into every opportunity that presents itself, and it\u2019s important not to keep pushing yourself until you drop from exhaustion. If you do, you\u2019ll miss out on all that stillness has to offer you: rest, regrowth, a chance to restore your energy for the days when you\u2019ll need it most.\n\nTaurus Weekly Horoscope\n\nIf you\u2019ve forgotten how to let yourself be nurtured and loved, this is a week to teach yourself again. Even if you\u2019re skilled at caring for other people, at offering them exactly the love that they need, it\u2019s an entirely different challenge to accept the care other people have to give to you. Don\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re fine without it, that you\u2019ve never needed or wanted love anyway. Let yourself need other people, just as they\u2019ve always needed you. It\u2019s scary and strange, and it\u2019s worth it.\n\nGemini Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, you\u2019ll be offered a chance to let some things go. This opportunity could present itself in a variety of ways: It could be that you\u2019ll decide to no longer be bothered by some irritation that\u2019s been following.Or you may run into someone who wronged you long ago and decide, to your own surprise, that you simply no longer care. You might find that your energies are needed elsewhere, that your rage has more pressing targets. Letting things go isn\u2019t always so easy, but this week, it might be.\n\nCancer Weekly Horoscope\n\nSo much of the time, you\u2019re willing to tolerate a certain amount of imbalance in your relationships. You\u2019re willing to offer the people you love everything you can give, regardless of what they offer you in return. This week, check the balance of love in your life. Are you getting what you need? Are you giving far more than anyone can ever give back to you? This week, don\u2019t let the imbalances slide. Keep giving what you can, but not so much that your own heart winds up empty.\n\nLeo Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, it might feel strangely difficult to know how to respond to conflict, to crises, even to small disagreements. Normally, you\u2019re so sure on your feet and quick to make a move, but you might feel unusually hesitant right now \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t force yourself to act when you aren\u2019t ready, and don\u2019t force yourself to argue for a position you\u2019re not yet sure you even agree with. You can move as slowly and carefully as you need to. You can take your time gathering the information you\u2019ll need. You can keep your balance and refuse to be rushed by anyone.\n\nVirgo Weekly Horoscope\n\nIt\u2019s so important not to disregard pleasure this week. You might already know, intellectually, that enjoying all that life has to offer is important, but so often, your work gets in the way. So often, your obligations end up coming first, and pushing everything else aside. So this week, no matter what else happens, try to make time for indulging your senses. Make time to notice the beauty of the sky, or to appreciate the sweetness of your friendships.\n\nLibra Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, you\u2019ll have the opportunity to reconsider the futures you\u2019ve dreamed of for yourself. It isn\u2019t that you should become less ambitious, or that you should stop wanting a good and beautiful life. Rather, this week is about allowing the scope of your vision to expand, and allowing your dreams to change course. If you give yourself permission to lay down the dreams that have become burdens and not beacons, you might find what you\u2019ve actually been seeking all this time.\n\nScorpio Weekly Horoscope\n\nWhen the world feels overwhelming, it can make you defensive. It can make you turn to tactics of avoidance and escape, or it can send you deep into your own head, where the rest of the world can\u2019t reach you. This week, you might have better results if you remain steady, if you refuse to retreat. You can trust your ability to participate in the messy world without losing yourself; you can engage with other people with a full heart, and your full heart won\u2019t betray you.\n\nSagittarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nGive yourself permission to do the things you\u2019re good at; give yourself permission to do what you enjoy. It\u2019s worthwhile to keep growing, keep challenging yourself, keep risking failure, but don\u2019t reserve all of your energy for only the labor that feels difficult. This week, remember to use your talents, too. Follow your natural inclinations and see where they lead you. Do the work that feels right, and remember that it doesn\u2019t need to feel like suffering.\n\nCapricorn Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, don\u2019t attempt to be hard or unbending; steeliness won\u2019t save you right now. You aren\u2019t impermeable, and this is a week to embrace the softer parts of your life. It\u2019s a week to hold the people who love you, and to invest as much in your relationships as in your ambitions. If you\u2019re kind to other people this week, it will lead to surprising rewards down the road, but it will also bring you good and beautiful things right now.\n\nAquarius Weekly Horoscope\n\nSometimes, balance can feel the same as stasis. Sometimes, you can feel like you need to cause a disturbance, to make some noise, just to make sure you\u2019re actually living. This week, though, the world might remind you that you can move while keeping your balance; you can change without blowing up your whole life. If you maintain your composure right now, it may lead to wild and beautiful change in the future. Holding steady can offer you power and strength beyond what you could\u2019ve even imagined.\n\nPisces Weekly Horoscope\n\nThis week, allow some space for your relationships to change, and for your feelings to breathe. Even the sweetest intimacy and even the most powerful love won\u2019t stay the same forever, so don\u2019t expect them to. It\u2019s possible that your needs have shifted, or that your heart has changed, or that the world you live in has become unrecognizably new. Think about new ways to offer your love in a changed world, and don\u2019t be alarmed if other people offer you different kinds of love, too. Change doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re losing something.\n\nGet Madame Clairevoyant every week.
