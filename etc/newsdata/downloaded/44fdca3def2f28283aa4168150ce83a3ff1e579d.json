In the U.K., where the narrow streets of the City of London sit above one of the world\u2019s biggest hoards of bullion, Brexit uncertainty has injected further vim into the market.\n\nIn terms of sterling, gold is more expensive than it has ever been.\n\nDuncan Brown, a former salesperson at a global hedge fund, owns gold in an account with Glint Pay Ltd., a startup that recently expanded into the U.S. It started as a bit of fun: With Glint, customers can buy their morning coffee in exchange for a fraction of an ounce of bullion.\n\nBut Mr. Brown also owns gold to guard against the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, which would sever almost half a century of economic and political integration with the European Union at a stroke. This could lead to shortages of fuel and medicine, long traffic jams at ports and civic unrest, the U.K. government said this week, outlining a \u201creasonable worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs sterling goes down and demand for gold goes up, you\u2019re winning on both fronts,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s sensible to have some sort of hedge in place, so you don\u2019t get collared by sterling.\u201d\n\nGold prices typically rise in terms of the U.K. currency when the pound weakens against the dollar, making the precious metal a hedge against the risk of a disorderly break with the EU. In early September, shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson came to power with a \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the bloc by Oct. 31, sterling sank to a 34-year low of $1.20 and gold hit an all-time high of \u00a31,278.06 ($1,576.06) a troy ounce, according to the London Bullion Market Association.\n\nThe pound has since staged a recovery and gold prices have tailed off, after members of Parliament took steps to prevent Mr. Johnson from taking the U.K. out of the EU without a deal.\n\nJoshua Saul, founder of the Pure Gold Co., a brokerage, receives lots of inquiries from bankers and investors who want to buy gold with their own money. One London-based fund manager at a large asset manager said she and some of her colleagues have bought the precious metal because they expect the pound to fall further.\n\nFinancial professionals aren\u2019t the only people who see gold as a way to defend their savings at a time of political and economic uncertainty in the U.K. and abroad. Robert Toogood, a retired clergyman from Hampshire in southern England who now writes books on history and religion, bought gold for the first time over the summer because he \u201cfelt there was such volatility with Brexit and China versus America\u201d and sees gold as a universal currency.\n\n\u201cMy wife is younger than me and is still working and really I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ve got to do something, all I can, to make sure that she\u2019s got enough to live on when I meet the previous vicars of Bramley,\u201d Mr. Toogood said, referring to his final parish. Mr. Toogood bought his gold through U.K. company BullionVault Ltd., which pays security firms to keep customers\u2019 bullion safe.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is it a smart choice for people in the U.K. to place their bets on gold? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn the U.K., there are perks to holding certain kinds of gold coins struck by the Royal Mint, a government-owned company. Sovereigns\u2014first minted in 1489 and which now bear the face of Queen Elizabeth II \u2014and Britannias are often bought as investments, but they can technically be used as legal tender, making them exempt from capital-gains tax.\n\nIn 2015, demand for the Royal Mint\u2019s Sovereign coins surged from Greeks who were spooked by the country\u2019s debt crisis and yanking money out of their deposit accounts, even though the tax exemption only applies to U.K. residents.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nRob Halliday-Stein, founder of BullionbyPost, said the two coins are the company\u2019s most popular items and that August was the U.K. company\u2019s best-ever month. He describes his customers as mostly male and sharing a \u201cmistrust of financial institutions, of \u2018the system.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome amateur traders regularly buy and sell, treating Brexit as a chance to cash in on day-to-day moves in sterling and gold prices. As the government clashed with opposition members of Parliament earlier this month, IT consultant Chris Hall traded gold with the BullionVault app on his mobile phone while watching the fiery debates unfold in the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing to say, but when the pound\u2019s falling, you think to yourself now\u2019s the time to buy gold,\u201d said Mr. Hall, who is from Herefordshire on the England-Wales border. \u201cWhen Boris lost his couple of votes, it was a great time to buy it as long as you were on your toes.\u201d\n\nRelated Video \u201cOperation Yellow Hammer,\u201d a previously confidential U.K. government document outlining what might happen in case of a no-deal Brexit, describes shortages of fuel and medicines, chaos at the border, and increased food prices.\n\n\u2014Caitlin Ostroff contributed to this article.\n\nTo receive our Markets newsletter every morning in your inbox, click here.\n\nWrite to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com", "description": "As Brexit upends U.K. politics and hammers the pound, some Britons are searching for a haven\u2014and the chance to make a quick buck\u2014in the gold market.", "authors": ["Joe Wallace", "Joe.Wallace Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106608/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
