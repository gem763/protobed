No need for pain medicine.\u201d\n\nShe started looking for help for her daughter after being told her condition could increase Luna\u2019s risk of skin cancer.\n\nCarol had almost lost hope when doctors in the US said Luna would need to endure up to 100 operations using laser surgery over five years.\n\nAfter reading about her story in a local newspaper hospital director Dr Pavel Popov offered Luna up to eight surgeries in 18 months in Krasnodar, Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLuna\u2019s parents were offered . . . 80 surgeries in five years. They were supposed to start when the girl grows up, plus it was planned to carry them (the surgeries) out in different medical institutions in America,\u201d Popov said.\n\n\u201cAnd for all this you had to pay a crazy amount of money. The doctors deliberately proposed a treatment regime that does not fit into any framework of American insurance medicine.\n\n\u201cThey were uncomfortable just saying: \u2018We can't operate on your girl, we can't do everything the way you want\u2019.\u201d\n\nHis method doesn\u2019t involve \u201ca large-scale bloody surgery\u201d or the \u201cexcision of a large amount of tissue\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can do such operations on an outpatient basis, under local anaesthetic and without a drop of blood,\u201d he said.\n\nThe doctor, who\u2019s done a similar operation on a Russian girl, says he bonded with Luna straight away when they met for the first time. \u201cAs soon as her mother brought her into my consulting room, the girl extended both hands to me, grabbed my thumbs and never let go.\u201d\n\nSources: Daily Mail, Instagram", "description": "Luna has congenital melanocytic nevus, a birthmark which usually looks like a huge, dark blemish, often on the face.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9461/765a9dcfab6244eb9ef0a5b4752646b6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
