The suit names the book\u2019s publishers as defendants, which DOJ said was intended only to ensure that no funds were transferred to Snowden while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n\u201cEdward Snowden has violated an obligation he undertook to the United States when he signed agreements as part of his employment by the CIA and as an NSA contractor,\u201d Jody Hunt of DOJ\u2019s Civil Division said in a statement. \u201cWe will not permit individuals to enrich themselves, at the expense of the United States, without complying with their pre-publication review obligations.\u201d\n\nBen Wizner, a Snowden attorney and director of the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a statement that Snowden didn\u2019t believe the government would have reviewed his book in good faith.\n\nHe suggested the government\u2019s lawsuit might set off the Streisand effect.\n\n\u201cMr. Snowden wrote this book to continue a global conversation about mass surveillance and free societies that his actions helped inspire,\u201d he said. \u201cHe hopes that today\u2019s lawsuit by the United States government will bring the book to the attention of more readers throughout the world.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Snowden encouraged his followers to buy \u201cthe book the government does not want you to read,\u201d and suggested the publisher \u201cprint excerpts from the government\u2019s furious objection to the publication of this book on the cover of every copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is hard to think of a greater stamp of authenticity than the US government filing a lawsuit claiming your book is so truthful that it was literally against the law to write,\u201d Snowden tweeted.\n\nRead the lawsuit below.\n\nThis has been updated with Wizner\u2019s statement and Snowden\u2019s tweets.", "description": "The government says the former CIA and NSA official's new book, \"Permanent Record,\" violates his nondisclosure agreements.", "authors": ["Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8114aa2400002e2a7cfaf3.jpeg?cache=kuckkatqtd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
