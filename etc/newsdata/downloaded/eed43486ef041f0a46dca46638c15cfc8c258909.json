I think he\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said after the game, per ESPN. \u201cHe was pretty good at the end there. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\u201d\n\nThe Colts delivered a primer on how to beat the Chiefs on Sunday night\n\nSaid Mahomes: \u201cJust reaggravated it a little bit there in the first half and then got stepped on in the second half. Obviously it\u2019s going to be a little sore tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMahomes, who completed 22 of 39 passes for 321 yards and a touchdown against the Colts, did not seem concerned that he would miss any time (the Chiefs host the Texans next Sunday). But he clearly was not operating at his usual speed because of his ankle on Sunday night.\n\nAD\n\nMahomes clearly dealing with ankle pic.twitter.com/sk65ZBbUg1 \u2014 Mike Chappell (@mchappell51) October 7, 2019\n\nThe NFL\u2019s reigning MVP has never shied away from taking big hits over his brief but incandescent NFL career, even trying to chase down Lions defensive lineman A\u2019Shawn Robinson on a fumble return in Week 4. Plays like that have teammates at least slightly concerned.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s tough. Guys like Patrick Mahomes, they don\u2019t want to lose,\u201d Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu told the Kansas City Star before Sunday\u2019s loss. \u201cI mean you applaud it as teammates. You love it. If your quarterback is physical, then we should all be physical.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t do that no more, Pat.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more concerning to the Chiefs after Sunday\u2019s loss was the status of defensive tackle Chris Jones, who left the game with a groin injury in the third quarter. Jones had 15.5 sacks last season and is probably the best player on a defense that has struggled to get opposing offenses off the field. Kansas City already was missing defensive tackle Alex Okafor (hip), and fellow defensive tackle Xavier Williams also left the game in the first half with an ankle injury.\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the NFL from The Post:\n\nSteelers\u2019 Mason Rudolph knocked out on scary helmet-to-helmet hit\n\nHail or Fail: Jay Gruden\u2019s final game as Redskins coach was another dud\n\nWeek 6 fantasy waiver wire options\n\nRedskins fire Coach Jay Gruden after 0-5 start\n\nAwful on field and directionless off, it\u2019s time for Redskins to face a hard reality\n\nPatriots\u2019 offense \u2018can be a lot better,\u2019 Tom Brady says after win over Redskins\n\nPatriots fans took over FedEx Field and even Tom Brady thought it was \u2018ridiculous\u2019\n\nNorman Chad: Upon further review, the call stands: Replay stinks\n\nAD", "description": "Kansas City suffered a number of key injuries on Sunday night.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/71p9JcHQ8oCrCKZCReCzJfwTP0Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/5XUXN2XIYAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
