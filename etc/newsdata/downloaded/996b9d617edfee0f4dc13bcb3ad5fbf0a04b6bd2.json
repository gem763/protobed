That's comparable to other on-demand streaming services.\n\nSelections will range from new releases to catalogue titles from participating studios. New releases will be available the same time they are available digitally nationwide. Crucially, they will not be available while they are playing in theaters. Though in the past some studios have voiced interest in creating a premium on-demand window for popular movies, in which select titles would be available on demand before the traditional exclusive 90-day theatrical window has elapsed, those talks have since stopped. AMC Theatres On Demand will respect the window.\n\nRead more: Taika Waititi explains the origins of his Oscar contender \"Jojo Rabbit,\" why he ended up playing Hitler, and what it was like directing in costume\n\nThe chain has also made a cross-platform marketing partnership with AMC Networks. Through the deal, the libraries of AMC Networks' IFC Films and RLJE Films will be available on the service beginning in late 2019.\n\nThis is the first time a US exhibitor has dipped into a business venture dedicated to the home. But to connect the service back to its theaters, members of the chain's popular AMC Stubs loyalty program who use the on-demand service will earn points towards in-theater rewards.\n\nYou can rent or purchase titles at AMC's website.", "description": "The largest movie-theater chain in the world is getting into the on-demand business with AMC Theatres On Demand.", "authors": ["Jason Guerrasio"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8758b62e22af0048502933?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
