Let\u2019s hope as we move forward that maybe that\u2019s one less fascist tactic he and his supporters use during chants. You are going to actually imprison your political opponents!\u201d Scarborough pleaded. Co-host Mika Brzezinski chimed in to call the chants \u201csickening.\u201d\n\nThis flash of insight did not sit well with the audience that has been listening to Scarborough and his fellow mainstream media talkers trash Trump for three years. They took to social media en masse to slam Scarborough for his appeal to decency, framing the chant as a great moment for democracy and freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cNothing more American than speaking truth to power,\u201d one user exulted.\n\n\u201cPeople without power have only the freedom of speech and protest. They used it,\u201d another observed.\n\n100 % wrong - it is the only language he understands- we DO want the world to know we do not stand by this illegitimate president - he was placed by putin - we should be in the streets chanting - #LockHimUp\u064b - #impeachment asap #saveAMERICApic.twitter.com/dBtCYbvfIz \u2014 ROSIE (@Rosie) October 28, 2019\n\nThe misrule, cruelty and infantilism of this administration is such that some sense of an enduring ethos is actually redeemed when we the people openly express our contempt.

He has previously called the president a greater threat to America than the 9/11 hijackers, and has a portrait of ex-special counsel Robert Mueller on the wall of the home he shares with Brzezinski. He\u2019s such a rabid Russiagater that he nicknamed Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d for refusing to back several Democrat-sponsored election security bills and even appeared to blame Russia for the prison death of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nAlso on rt.com Top MSNBC host links RUSSIA to convicted pedophile Epstein\u2019s death\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "The #Resistance has turned on MSNBC host Joe Scarborough after the staunchly anti-Trump pundit slammed the audience at a baseball game as \u201cun-American\u201d for chanting \u201clock him up!\u201d when the president was shown on TV.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db7334c85f540334c281a5d.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
