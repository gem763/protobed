Male and female astronauts will soon wear gender-neutral suits.\n\nThe new xEMU suits will be worn during extra vehicular activities (EVAs), like when they\u2019re on the lunar surface, and they\u2019re allow for different parts to be mixed and matched with different sizes.\n\nBridenstine and NASA spacesuit engineers said the suit's increased mobility in the joints and at the waist will allow Artemis astronauts to do much more on the moon than Apollo astronauts could 50 years ago.\n\nThe xEMU suit wasn\u2019t the only new design NASA unveiled on Tuesday. The agency also modeled a new survival flight suit \u2014 the orange jumpsuit that astronauts will wear for takeoff and landing \u2014 called the Orion.\n\nBoth suits also have new safety features. Astronauts could be protected from temperature variations from 250\u00b0Fahrenheit to minus 250\u00b0 Fahrenheit while wearing the xEMU in the vacuum of space.\n\nChristopher Hansen, the manager at the agency\u2019s EVA office, said the xEMU suit will \u201ccontinuously scrub\u201d carbon dioxide, which will make it more resource-efficient than older suits.\n\nGohmert told reporters that the Orion survival suit will \u201cbe the backup in case anything ever goes wrong\u201d during takeoff or landing during an Artemis mission.\n\nMore than 50 years after the first Apollo moon landing, Bridenstine said NASA is committed to sending a woman to the moon with the Artemis mission \u2014 named for the twin sister of the Greek god Apollo.\n\n\u201cAs much as we love Apollo,\u201d he said, \u201cin those days there were no opportunities for women. Today we have an extremely diverse, highly qualified astronaut corps that includes women. And they are extremely excited about going to the moon.\u201d\n\nThe initial goal was to send astronauts to the moon by 2028, but President Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE announced in March that he wanted the Artemis 3 mission ready by 2024.\n\nThe Artemis program\u2019s ultimate goal is to launch a manned mission to Mars from the moon. But before any of that can happen, Bridenstine said, \u201cwe need spacesuits.\u201d", "description": "NASA released its latest generation of spacesuits Tuesday in advance of planned missions to the moon and beyond.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/img_2999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
