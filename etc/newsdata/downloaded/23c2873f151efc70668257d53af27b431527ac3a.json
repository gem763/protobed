Forecasters are continuing to monitor the storm before it makes landfall this Labor Day weekend.\n\n\u201cYou should assume there is going to be power loss if you\u2019re in the path of this storm,\u201d Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told residents.\n\nMr. Trump canceled a trip to Poland to monitor the storm, sending Vice President Mike Pence instead.\n\nThe president spoke to reporters as he left the White House for Camp David in Maryland. He will be accompanied by his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and Peter Brown, his homeland security and counterterrorism adviser.\n\nHe plans to return Sunday for a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s headquarters.\n\nMr. Trump is confronting hurricane season without a permanent FEMA director. The acting director is Pete T. Gaynor.\n\nMr. Trump says it\u2019s OK to have top aides serving in an acting capacity since it gives him \u201cflexibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I like them I make them permanent,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
