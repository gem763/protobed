Illustration: Br\u00e1ulio Amado and Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n\nHe might be just 23, but Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is already an Oscar-nominated leading man, a social-media phenomenon, and, perhaps most surprisingly, a fashion icon. This awards season, only two years after Call Me by Your Name and Lady Bird, he stars again in two anticipated movies: Netflix\u2019s The King, based loosely on Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenriad\u201d cycle of plays, and Greta Gerwig\u2019s star-studded adaptation of Little Women. Here, the accumulated wisdom from countless interviews of (and about) the internet\u2019s latest boyfriend.\n\nWhere He Grew Up\n\nNew York City, on 43rd Street in Hell\u2019s Kitchen. His mom was a dancer, his dad edited French publications at UNICEF, and his sister is an actress. (\u201cI like to think that the need to act and be seen came from my mom\u2019s side, but the ability to listen came from my dad\u2019s side.\u201d) Growing up, he liked Power Rangers and soccer and spent summers in France that, he says, led to \u201ca little bit of ambiguity in the self-identity sense, which helps a lot creatively because I don\u2019t feel as constricted by who I am.\u201d\n\nHis School Years\n\n\u27bd Chalamet knew he was really passionate about acting after seeing Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight at age 12: \u201cI just had no clue what was going on in his head, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.\u201d\n\n\u27bd In 2013, he graduated from La Guardia High, the arts-school inspiration for Fame, where he dated Madonna\u2019s daughter, Lourdes Leon.\n\n\u27bd He acted in high-school theater productions but often lost the lead part to Ansel Elgort, who was one year above him.\n\n\u27bd After he filmed Interstellar in 2013, Chalamet spent a year at Columbia and then transferred to NYU for a couple of semesters. \u201cIt felt like a clear decision to not [finish]; it was scary because I didn\u2019t want to rob myself of growing as a human. But it\u2019s been the exact opposite: going from set to set; working with creative, open people; having mentors rooting for you. There\u2019s education within that, I guess.\u201d\n\nHis Short-Lived Rap Career\n\nAs a high-school student, he performed and wrote rudimentary raps under the moniker Lil Timmy Tim. In one, he raps about statistics.\n\nWhat He Orders at McDonald\u2019s\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a chicken-nuggets man.\u201d He brought a bag to his first day of filming on Call Me by Your Name.\n\nCall Him By \u2026\n\n\u201cMy whole life, I was Timmy, and then as I got older, it seemed like Timmy was youthing me out, so it\u2019s been Timoth\u00e9e since.\u201d His mother would email producers, asking them to correct the spelling: e, with an accent. \u201cThe real pronunciation is Timo-tay, but I can\u2019t ask people to call me that; it just seems really pretentious.\u201d On the set of Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig and star Saoirse Ronan started calling him \u201cPony.\u201d \u201cBecause he\u2019ll come up to Greta and me and nuzzle us,\u201d said Ronan. \u201cIt\u2019s quite disarming. My pretty Pony!\u201d\n\nHis Big Break\n\nOn Homeland\u2019s second season, he is the vice-president\u2019s surly son, who dates the daughter of double agent Nicholas Brody, played by Damian Lewis. Lewis told his agent to give the 17-year-old a call. The agent signed the young actor, and the agent\u2019s husband went on to produce Call Me by Your Name. \u201cI didn\u2019t make Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cAlthough, of course, when I see him, I tell him I did.\u201d\n\nHis Bigger Break\n\nPlaying the lovestruck, confused, and passionate teen Elio Perlman in Call Me by Your Name made him the youngest Best Actor Oscar nominee in 78 years.\n\nThe Almost Spider-Man\n\nHe made Marvel\u2019s short list for the Spidey reboot Homecoming, but eventually lost to Tom Holland. \u201cI read twice, and I left sweating in a total panic. I called my agent, [UTA\u2019s] Brian Swardstrom, and I said, \u2018Brian, I thought about this a lot, and I have to go back and knock on that door and read again.\u2019 He told me the story of Sean Young and how in an attempt to become Catwoman she had scared everyone away when she showed up at the studio gates in costume.\u201d\n\nSomething Greta Gerwig Has Said About Him\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to revive Tiger Beat just for him.\u201d\n\nThe Fandom\n\n\u27bd Chalamet\u2019s fans pepper him with questions on Twitter, Photoshop him into Renaissance paintings on Instagram, and compulsively GIF his every move on Tumblr.\n\n\u27bd They call him \u201cTimmy.\u201d\n\n\u27bd Derek, a teenager from upstate New York, is acknowledged as the king within the Chalamet fan community. He has wished him good morning and good night every day for over two years on Twitter.\n\n\u27bd \u201cWhere\u2019s derek tho,\u201d Chalamet tweeted on March 22, 2018, to the envy of many of his other fans.\n\n\u27bd He has been the subject of a million and one comparisons to former teen heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio, which his Call Me by Your\n\nName director, Luca Guadagnino, dismissed: \u201cI think Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\u201d\n\n\u201cUHMMM OKAY STRIKE ME THE FUCK DOWN\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what he tweeted when his favorite rapper, Kid Cudi, called him his \u201cfavorite artist of the moment right now\u201d after seeing his performance in Call Me by Your Name. The two have since become friends: Cudi was a guest at a dinner celebrating his GQ cover, Chalamet went to Cudi\u2019s birthday dinner (with Pete Davidson and Kanye West), and Cudi was his plus-one to The King\u2019s Venice premiere.\n\nRelationship Status\n\nLately, he has been spotted kissing his King co-star Lily-Rose Depp.\n\nHe Loves High Fashion (and Vice Versa)\n\nOn red carpets, Chalamet has been known to rap Cardi B and wear experimental high fashion. He doesn\u2019t have a stylist, as he prefers to work directly with designers, including Raf Simons and Haider Ackermann. This has led to some surprises. He had the most discussed look of the 2019 awards season: a sequin-adorned Louis Vuitton harness. \u201cThey told me it was a bib!\u201d he said afterward. \u201cI had a friend send me a thing that, like, sex-dungeon culture is a thing where you wear harnesses. I didn\u2019t do it for that reason, but, uh \u2026 \u201d\n\n*A version of this article appears in the October 14, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
