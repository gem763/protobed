Refugees", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wall Streeters will happily expound upon the many uses of finance: to ensure the safety of assets and belongings, to solve timing problems between the outflow and inflow of capital, to allocate risks to parties that can best handle them and to channel resources to productive uses. What they may not have considered is who needs all those services more than anyone -- the world\u2019s 70 million refugees and internally displaced people.\n\nThat shocking number is the highest since World War II. What\u2019s worse, people are being displaced for ever-longer periods of time: The average refugee today won\u2019t break out of that status for over a decade. And, contrary to public perception in wealthy countries, developing nations host 90% of the global refugee population. Those countries are especially ill-prepared for the burden, given that they\u2019re already struggling to meet the needs of their own citizens.\n\nOur basic approach to this challenge remains woefully outdated. At the outset of every crisis, there is a noble and heroic effort to provide safety and necessities such as food, tents and medicines. After this \u201cemergency\u201d phase, international attention and aid commitments drop precipitously.\n\nOnly two years since more than half a million Rohingya refugees were driven out of Myanmar, the plan to cover their basic needs for this year is only one-quarter funded. Meanwhile, most refugees are prohibited by national laws from legally working, starting a business or accessing banks and financial services -- in short, they are blocked from striving to meet their own needs.\n\nBetter access to finance could address many of these problems. For one thing, it\u2019s important to remember that refugees are not completely destitute, at least not at the beginning of their periods of exile; many carry savings and valuables with them. That means they have a real need to protect their portable assets. Yet, because they typically aren\u2019t allowed access to local banking systems, they face the risk of robbery and physical danger. They also forego, of course, any interest and capital accumulation their savings could generate.\n\nThe United Nations already registers refugees in a secure system for the purposes of protection and aid distribution; in theory, that\u2019s just a step from providing them basic, no-frills savings accounts. Another option would be for governments hosting large numbers of refugees to grant them access to the local banking system, as Pakistan has recently done. This would allow a sizeable influx of capital into developing countries, while ensuring the safety of refugees and their assets.\n\nSecondly, finance can help solve the imbalance between a quick surge of donations and long-term funding gaps. To do so, we need to take the initial spike of money and invest some of it to generate returns over time. If agencies could count on income coming in year-after-year, for example, they could more quickly switch to building durable infrastructure for refugee camps, including things like better roads and water treatment facilities.\n\nThird, since refugees are being hosted by some of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, there is a critical need for insurance arrangements to mitigate disaster risks. Half of the world\u2019s top 10 refugee-hosting countries -- Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Sudan and Uganda -- are also among the nations most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nSwissRe AG has already worked with local insurers and NGOs in Bangladesh and Kenya on pilot projects to insure local farmers against crop failure and flood risks. These models should be extended to cover refugee populations; donor budgets can help cover the costs. Today, if a disaster hits, the affected country\u2019s government and donors shoulder 100% of the burden. With an insurance arrangement in place, the costs would be shared by a much larger, more global set of financiers better equipped to weather the storm.\n\nFinally and most importantly, finance can help unleash the enormous potential of refugees and displaced people. It\u2019s no accident that refugees -- including Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, Vladimir Nabokov and Marc Chagall -- shine as some of our greatest examples of human accomplishment. Historically, when displaced people have been lucky enough to land in countries that allowed them to start businesses, the results have been spectacular. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by refugees, immigrants or their children.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Wall Streeters will happily expound upon the many uses of finance: to ensure the safety of assets and belongings, to solve timing problems between the outflow and inflow of capital, to allocate risks to parties that can best handle them and to channel resources to productive uses", "authors": ["Irene Yuan Sun"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
