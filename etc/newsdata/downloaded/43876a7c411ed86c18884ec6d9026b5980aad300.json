(AP) \u2014 Nineteen of the Democrats running for president are in New Hampshire for the state party convention Saturday \u2014 an event that provides an important chance for them to woo political power brokers in the first-in-the nation primary state.\n\nThe candidates all will get the opportunity to speak from the stage and make the case that they're the best Democrat to take on President Donald Trump.\n\nJoe Biden, the first candidate to speak, said Trump has \"unleashed the deepest, darkest forces in this nation,\" and the former vice president told New Hampshire voters: \"We cannot, and I will not, let this man be reelected president of the United States of America.\"\n\nDemocrats in New Hampshire have been slow to endorse so far this election system. That's due in part to the large number of candidates in the race as well as lingering tensions over the 2016 primary battle between Vermont Sen.
