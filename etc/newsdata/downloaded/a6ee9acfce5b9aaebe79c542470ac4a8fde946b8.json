Not so with this clever machine that allows you to do both, making this a one-stop pot for a hearty dinner. The dishwasher safe glass lid means you can check on your meal as it cooks without releasing any heat, and the 3.5L capacity easily feeds three to four people (and fits a whole chicken). It\u2019s smarter looking than most, even featuring the notoriously trendy rose gold colour. But unfortunately, there\u2019s no keep-warm function.\n\nBuy now\n\nLakeland 2-pot slow cooker: \u00a359.99, Lakeland\n\nIf you like the idea of cooking more than one pot of food at a time but the three-pot slow cooker (also reviewed here) feels a bit overkill, then feast your eyes on this. The ceramic cooking pots work independently of each other so you can do one main dish and a side or pud at the same time and each has a low and high setting, plus keep-warm. We found the stoneware pots robust and non-stick \u2013 and they look good on the table, so no need to transfer to a serving dish \u2013 while the glass lids allow for monitoring cooking. Everything can go in the dishwasher afterwards. But the cooking pots are 2L each, which might be too small for some.\n\nBuy now\n\nCrock-Pot lift and serve 4.7L digital slow cooker: \u00a344.99, Amazon\n\nThis machine, from the original slow cooker brand, produces mouth-watering tagines, succulent joints and tasty puddings \u2013 and there\u2019s enough to feed a family of four. The hinged lid is great for clean freaks as any condensation just drips back in, and you can remove it for easy cleaning (this, plus the bowl, can go in the dishwasher). Other handy features include the adjustable timer (from 30 minutes to 20 hours) and digital display, so you never have to guess how long is left. There are three settings \u2013 low, high and keep-warm, we thought the recipes in the booklet were rather good too.\n\nBuy now\n\nMorphy Richards sear stew and stir slow cooker 461010: \u00a369.99, Amazon\n\nThis is a one-stop-shop for preparing dinner in minimal time, thanks to the fact that it sears and stews, then the removable paddle can stir automatically if needs be. There\u2019s also a pulse mode, as well as four different heat settings. The non-stick pot is much lighter than most and can go on the hob \u2013 handy if you need to finish something off \u2013 while the glass lid allows for checking on progress. The 3.5L pot is pretty average size-wise \u2013 ideal for a family of four \u2013 and everything feels very well engineered. But it\u2019s not as modern looking as some.\n\nBuy now\n\nSage the fast slow pro: \u00a3119, Amazon\n\nAs pricey as this may be, it is so much more than a slow cooker. You can use this one-pot wonder for fast cooking too, as it doubles up as a pressure cooker, as well as being able to sear, saute, reduce and steam. We enjoyed some delicious soups and rice dishes, among other things. It\u2019s got all sorts of features (this is a brand with Heston Blumenthal behind it) that monitor food types and tell you what\u2019s happening during the cooking process. There's a keep-warm function that lasts up to two hours and it\u2019s easy to clean, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nRussell Hobbs chalkboard slow cooker: \u00a324.96, Amazon\n\nWe love this quirky slow cooker, the matte powder coating allows you to write on it. So whether it\u2019s \u201chands off until dinner time!\u201d or \u201cVeronica\u2019s venison stew\u201d, get the chalk at the ready for your feisty or frivolous messages. The 3.5L capacity caters for up to four people and there are three heat settings, including a keep-warm feature\u2013 perfect if anyone is running late. But frustratingly, removing the \u201cwrite on me\u201d branded sticker makes a horrible sticky, gooey mess \u2013 nail polish remover was the only thing that would remove ours.\n\nBuy now\n\nBella Cook and serve 3 pot slow cooker: \u00a339.95, Amazon\n\nThe USP here is the option to cook more than one dish at a time, with a keep-warm function that means the food can all stay in its respective pots until you\u2019re ready to eat. It doesn\u2019t get much more hassle-free than that. Great for small dinner parties, the pots even have spoon indentations and lid stands. We tried making curries, with good results. There\u2019s more washing up (although the stoneware pots and glass lids can go in the dishwasher) and you\u2019ll have to find extra storage space as it\u2019s pretty bulky. But for slow-cooking on mass, we think it\u2019s worth investing in.\n\nBuy now\n\nGeorge at Asda grey compact slow cooker: \u00a310, Asda\n\nThis light grey 1.8L slow cooker is aimed at households with one or two people (and, at a stretch, three) and makes rich sauces and super stews which it served up piping hot. It has two heat settings, a glass lid and dishwasher friendly ceramic bowl \u2013 and it\u2019s a doddle to clean and to store away. At a mere tenner, it\u2019s an absolute bargain so students, take note \u2013 although be warned there\u2019s no keep-warm function.\n\nBuy now\n\nCrock-Pot family multi and slow cooker: \u00a3119, John Lewis & Partners\n\nThis will set you back a bit, but costs hardly anything to run. It\u2019s big at 5.6L and is much more versatile than most, enabling you to bake, roast, saut\u00e9, steam and slow cook. It\u2019s a doddle to work and use, with the five pre-set programmes (although you can manually change the cooking times and temperatures too, which is good for precision cooking). We tried fish, veg and a cake and minimalised the washing up to practically zero. It\u2019s got all the bells and whistles you\u2019d expect \u2013 the keep-warm function, a robust glass lid and even a countdown timer so you know when to bung the rice or tatties on.\n\nBuy now\n\nTower 6.5L slow cooker: \u00a349.49, Tower\n\nYou won\u2019t mind if the neighbours all invite themselves to dinner with this stainless steel machine, which has an extra large capacity of 6.5L \u2013 ideal for batch cooking or homes with more hungry mouths to feed than most. There are two heat settings, plus keep-warm, and a glass lid. It\u2019s quite bulky, which you\u2019d expect given the larger size, but the non-slip feet means it stays put and the pot is easy to take out and clean up afterwards. Our meat didn\u2019t dry out, sauces stayed succulent and our curry was as scrummy as they come. It would have been nice to have a delay timer at this price, though.\n\nPre-order now\n\nThe verdict: Slow cookers\n\nThe Morphy Richards sear and stew slow cooker stands out from the crowd not just in terms of looks but practicality, not least because you can sear the meat first. We\u2019re also big fans of the Lakeland 2-Pot slow cooker and the Bella cook and serve 3 pot slow cooker \u2013 ideal for simultaneously cooking different dishes at the same time.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
