Under the rebel Benn Act passed in September he was legally required to ask for a further Brexit delay past October 31 if he could not agree a deal by this Saturday.\n\nWith a deal in place that Brexit delay of three months is off the table (for now). However EU officials have already suggested that there is already not enough time to get the deal signed and sealed by October 31.\n\nSo a short 'technical extension' that provides enough time for this to happen is likely to be on the agenda for the leaders. The question will be how long it is.\n\nDowning Street remains adamant that there must be no Brexit delay in order to preserve Mr Johnson's 'do or die' pledge.\n\nHowever, if the two sides are close to an orderly divorce it is unlikely that the UK would pull the plug.\n\nUltimately, Mr Johnson may be able to accept a short delay if that is the price of getting Brexit done in a non-chaotic manner.\n\nAssuming the leaders of the EU's 27 member states sign off the deal the PM will then have to present it to MPs for them to vote on.\n\nThat vote would likely take place on Saturday with the government having kept open the option of asking MPs to work at the weekend.\n\nDoes this mean the UK leaves the EU on October 31?\n\nNot necessarily. Jean-Claude Juncker today hinted that the EU would not grant another Brexit delay.\n\nAfter face-to-face talks with the PM he told reporters the deal 'has to' be approved by Parliament.\n\n'Anyway there will be no prolongation,' he added, regarding the October 31 deadline.\n\n'We have concluded a deal and so there is not an argument for further delay - it has to be done now.'\n\nHowever, whether any requested extension is granted is not down to Mr Juncker - it requires the consent of the 27 remaining members of the European Council.\n\nAnd his remarks left open what could happen if the deal is voted down on Saturday, with the EU repeatedly saying that it will not be responsible for a No Deal Brexit.\n\nSo what will happen on 'Super Saturday' ?\n\nThe Prime Minister is certain to use the weekend session - the first since 1982 - for a vote on his deal announced this morning\n\nThe DUP's Arlene Foster this morning said they could not support the deal because of concerns about the ability of the Northern Ireland Assembly to approve the complex customs plan in it\n\nIt's going to be massive. It will potentially pitch the Prime Minister against Labour, the other opposition parties and possibly even the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nThe latter are in a confident and supply agreement with the Tories but leader Arlene Foster remains opposed to the deal.\n\nShe announced this morning that they could not support it in its current form mainly because of concerns about the ability of the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote on supporting the complex customs plan in it.\n\nBut Mr Johnson send ahead and signed up anyway, in attempt to force the unionist party's hand. However this was tried without success by Theresa May last year.\n\nIf the DUP refuse to vote for the deal, a hardcore of the Tory European Research Group of Brexiteer ultras will not back it either, losing the PM more votes from his own side.\n\nMr Johnson would then require pro-deal Labour rebels to defy what looks certain to be a three-line whip against the deal ordered by Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nThis morning he said the deal was 'even worse' than Theresa May's doomed agreement today as he suggested he would fight it to the bitter end.\n\nIn addition Labour would-be rebels, mainly from Leave-supporting seats in the North of England, have this week suggested they would not rush to back Mr Johnson.\n\nThey have been unnerved by reports this week that the government plans to 'diverge' from EU rules on the environment and workers' rights after Brexit. These measures are key to winning them over.\n\nBoris Johnson needs 319 votes to win a majority. When MPs voted on Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement for the third and final time on March 29 it was defeated by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58.\n\nThat means Mr Johnson will need to persuade approximately 30 MPs to switch from opposing a deal to voting for one.\n\nThat also assumes that none of the 286 MPs who voted for the original deal have subsequently changed their minds.\n\nSo it comes down to a straight fight between yes or no?\n\nReports today suggested that Jeremy Corbyn could whip his MPs behind the amendment as a safety net in case the main deal passes, although that has been played down by party sources\n\nNo. There are additional plans afoot designed to tie the PM's hands.\n\nRemain-backing MPs are expected to try to force a vote on Saturday on holding a second referendum.\n\nThe exact terms are not yet clear but it is thought that if there is a deal then they will agree to back it on the grounds that the public are then given a final say on whether to accept it.\n\nThat referendum would then likely pitch the PM's deal against Remain.\n\nMr Johnson will resist any attempt to attach a second referendum to his deal and currently it is unclear whether there is a majority in Parliament in favour of a so-called 'People's Vote'.\n\nReports today suggested that Jeremy Corbyn could whip his MPs behind the amendment as a safety net in case the main deal passes, although that has been played down by party sources.\n\nIf a majority does emerge for a second referendum it will be difficult for the PM to resist given that Remain-backing MPs have repeatedly shown a willingness to seize control of the Brexit process.\n\nThen what happens between now and Halloween if all goes to plan?\n\nEU officials have already suggested that there is already not enough time to get the deal signed and sealed by October 31 and favour a short 'technical extension'\n\nParliament would then spend the coming week putting in place the legislation needed to actually make Brexit happen on October 31.\n\nIf Mr Johnson has a majority at the first vote on Saturday there is no reason to think that it would evaporate when it comes to voting on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.\n\nOnce Parliament has agreed the deal it will then be up to the European Parliament to do the same.\n\nBrexit critics have raised the prospect of trying to block the deal but if the European Commission, European Council and British Parliament have all backed it, MEPs will be under immense pressure not to scupper the process.\n\nAssuming all of those hurdles are cleared in a timely fashion then the UK will leave the EU with a deal on October 31.\n\nWhat happens to plans for a general election?\n\nThe timing of the general election will be determined by what happens on Saturday.\n\nIf Boris Johnson wins the Commons vote it will not take place until after Brexit happens on Halloween because there is no time.\n\nLabour may try to bring in a vote of no confidence in the Government but it is unlikely it will succeed if he can win a Brexit vote.\n\nHowever, if Mr Johnson loses the vote, he remains tied by the Benn Act to seek a Brexit delay until January.\n\nIf that happens Mr Johnon is certain to ask for an election and Labour would grant it once No Deal is scuppered.\n\nSo next week could see a fresh vote on holding a snap general election.\n\nMr Johnson has already tried twice to go to the country early but was thwarted by anti-No Deal MPs.\n\nIf MPs say yes then polling day would be at the end of November or the start of December.\n\nOne alternative would be for the opposition to bring forward a vote of no confidence to oust Mr Johnson and then allow Remain MPs to try to form a government of national unity.\n\nBut they have so far been so hopelessly divided that there is a risk they would not be able to do that. If no Government was formed after 14 days it would trigger an election.", "description": "Today's stunning announcement sets up a potentially showstopping Commons confrontation on Saturday.
