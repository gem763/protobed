Belugas and Inuvialuit: Our Survival Together, opens to the public on Friday at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa.\n\nThe show aims to help people understand into the Inuvialuit culture and traditions around whale harvesting, by sharing photo and video footage, historic artifacts, and stories from Pokiak's family.\n\n'We have generations of knowledge that have been passed on through families,' said Pokiak, whose uncle brought her three daughters on a beluga harvest this summer and came to see the exhibit along with her father. (CBC)\n\nBeluga whales are more than just food to Inuvialuit. A harvested whale can offer clues to a northerner about the current environment. As well, the hunt is an adventure that brings many families together, explained Pokiak, who has herself harpooned a whale.\n\n\"We have generations of knowledge that have been passed on through families,\" said Pokiak, whose uncle brought her three daughters on a beluga harvest this summer and came to see the exhibit along with her father.\n\n\"When you get a nod of approval from my dad or my uncle when they walk in here, [and] immediately stop and think, 'Wow, that is exactly what our summer kitchen looks like,' it's very special.\"\n\nThe exhibit is presented in partnership with the Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife, which had a similar show about 10 years ago.\n\nIt starts in Ottawa on Friday and will be up for about a year.", "description": "When Ottawa cultural educator Myrna Pokiak walked into the new exhibit she curated \u2014including a replica of a traditional Inuvialuit smokehouse \u2014 she felt a sense of home.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334759.1571969404!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/inuvialuit-beluga-museum-exhibit-ottawa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
