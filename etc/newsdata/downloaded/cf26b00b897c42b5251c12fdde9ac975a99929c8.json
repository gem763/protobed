Australian shares added 0.66% and Japan's Nikkei .N225 ticked up 0.15%.\n\nThe British pound, which had fallen 0.51% on Thursday after Johnson\u2019s call for a general election on Dec. 12, extended its slide, edging down to $1.2844.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson conceded on Thursday for the first time that he would not meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d deadline to leave the European Union next week.\n\nContinued uncertainty over Brexit comes against the backdrop of pertinently sluggish growth.\n\nNew orders for U.S.-made capital goods fell more than expected in September and shipments also declined, in a sign that business investment remains soft.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists in recent weeks showed that most think a steeper decline in global growth is more likely than a synchronised recovery, despite central bank easing.\n\nIn his last meeting as president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi left ECB policy and guidance unchanged, but advised his successor to \u201cnever give up\u201d on propping up the eurozone economy in the face of a worsening outlook.\n\nOn Wall Street, strong quarterly results from Microsoft (MSFT.O) and PayPal (PYPL.O) helped lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which closed up 0.81% at 8,185.80.\n\nThe S&P 500 .SPX also rose, gaining 0.19% on the day, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI finished 0.11% lower at 26,805.53, weighed down by 3M (MMM.N) after the company cut its full-year earnings forecast.\n\nHowever, caution prevails despite the gains in risk assets in recent weeks, supported by apparent progress in Brexit negotiations and China-U.S. trade talks.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, we conclude that we have not entered into a new \u2018risk on\u2019 phase from a broader trend perspective just yet,\u201d said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Dominion Securities.\n\nInvestors are also nervous ahead of a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalise a partial trade deal with China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\n\nRattling confidence was a speech by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday, which criticised China\u2019s handling of the Hong Kong protests and its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Those comments sent the S&P 500 index briefly lower.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR was lower, falling to 1.759% compared with its U.S. close of 1.766% on Thursday. The two-year yield US2YT=RR, which rises with traders\u2019 expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was down at 1.5757% compared with a U.S. close of 1.582%.\n\nInvestors are widely expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for a third time this year at its monetary policy meeting next week.\n\nThose expectations had helped to lift gold prices, but the precious metal XAU= was lower on Friday, dropping 0.14% to $1,501.10 per ounce.
