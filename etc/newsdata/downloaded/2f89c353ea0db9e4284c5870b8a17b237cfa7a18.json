We could tap into a market of 28million people.\n\n'A new meeting is scheduled this week. The championship would consist of 18 clubs, eight of which come from Belgium.\n\n'It could all go very quickly. If it is not for next season, then without a doubt in the next two seasons.'\n\nClub Brugge have won the Belgian top flight 15 times but could soon be given a new challenge\n\nThe Dutch Eredivisie is comprised of 18 teams, while the Jupiler Pro League has 16, meaning some teams would not make the cut for the new 'BeNe' division.\n\nBut the move could be crucial in ensuring Belgian clubs can attract higher quality talent and grow financially - something that can be achieved with the help of the Dutch top flight.\n\nVerhaeghe insisted that the move is well underway, but may hinge on TV deals as well as a rumoured European Super League that has long been under discussion.\n\n'The most important thing is that we are working on it, but we do not want to pin down on one or another deadline,' he added.\n\n'The TV contract in Belgium will expire soon, but not yet in the Netherlands. These are things that we must take into account.\n\n'We now also want to anticipate the reform of European football from 2024.'", "description": "The Eredivisie and the Belgian Jupiler Pro League could join forces next season to form an 18-team 'super league' that would challenge the top five European divisions.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20074338-0-image-a-4_1571819829671.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
