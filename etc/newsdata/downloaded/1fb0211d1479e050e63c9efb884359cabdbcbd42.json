Period,\" Huffman said in a statement after her sentencing. \"I would like to apologise again to my daughter, my husband, my family and the educational community for my actions.\n\n\"And I especially want to apologise to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices supporting their children.\"\n\nJudge Indira Talwani said she believes Huffman has accepted full responsibility for her actions, but \"trying to be a good mother does not excuse\" what she did.\n\nShe must report to prison in six weeks. Prosecutors had asked for a month in prison and a $20,000 fine.\n\nThe parents charged in the college scam investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents on applications.\n\nProsecutors say they managed to fraudulently secure spots for the teenagers at elite US universities including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to mail and honest services fraud in May. She is the first parent sentenced in the scandal.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five things to know about the college admissions scandal\n\nHer legal team had asked for a year of probation in lieu of jail time, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine.\n\nBut prosecutors wrote in a memo last week that \"neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes\".\n\nWhat did Huffman do?\n\nHuffman worked with the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, to falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy.\n\nSinger arranged for Sophia to take her SAT test in a special location, an exam widely used for college admissions in the US. Her result was a major improvement on her previous score.\n\nIn a letter to Judge Talwani, Huffman wrote: \"In my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot.\"\n\n\"I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter and failed my family.\"\n\nHuffman said in her letter to the judge that her daughter had been unaware of the fraud, and was devastated to learn of it.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Students react to cheating scam: \"This is how we got into an elite college\"\n\nThe actress wrote: \"When my daughter looked at me and asked me with tears streaming down her face, 'Why didn't you believe in me? Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?' I had no adequate answer for her.\n\n\"I could only say, 'I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.' In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid.\n\n\"I have compromised my daughter's future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity.\"\n\nProsecutors said Huffman made arrangements to have Singer cheat for her younger daughter as well before deciding against it.\n\nHuffman's husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges.\n\nThough Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, she paid among the smallest sums allegedly doled out by the parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents.\n\nLori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team.\n\nMs Loughlin is next due in court on 2 October.", "description": "The Desperate Housewives star apologised and said there were \"no excuses\" for her actions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n9vxv.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
