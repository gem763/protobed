He denies wrongdoing in every instance. Case 1000 is an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne. Case 2000 is examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper. Case 3000 is an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\n\nCase 4000, the most serious, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.\n\nHe must designate someone to form a government after the consultations, though there has been speculation that he will bring Gantz and Netanyahu together to explore options for a unity government.\n\nTuesday\u2019s elections ended in yet another deadlock, the second after April polls also finished inconclusively.\n\nBlue and White won the most seats, with 33 out of parliament\u2019s 120, while Likud finished second with 31. Neither has an obvious path to a majority coalition.\n\nNetanyahu struggles to hold on to power as Gantz claims victory Read more\n\nGantz is expected to have the endorsement of 57 seats during Rivlin\u2019s consultations, which continue on Monday. Netanyahu is expected to receive 55.\n\nThose totals do not include ex-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman\u2019s nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, which won eight seats.\n\nLieberman, who could potentially play a king-maker role, said on Sunday that he would not endorse either Netanyahu or Gantz for now. He has insisted on a unity government between his party, Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing Likud and Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White.\n\nHe added that for the time being he could not back Netanyahu because the premier is willing to form a coalition with Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, which he accuses of seeking to impose religious law on the secular population.\n\nLieberman also said he could not back Gantz for now because he might reach a deal with either the ultra-Orthodox or Israel\u2019s Arab parties, which he called \u201cenemies\u201d.\n\nFaced with disappointing results last week, Netanyahu acknowledged he was unable to form the rightwing coalition he had hoped for and called on Gantz to join him in a unity government.\n\nBut Gantz, who has also called for a unity government, made his position clear: He must be prime minister under any such arrangement, since his party has the most seats.\n\nRivlin would \u201cmake every effort to prevent a third set of elections,\u201d Harel Tubi, director general of the president\u2019s office, told Israel\u2019s army radio on Sunday.\n\nThe end of the Netanyahu era would be an extraordinary moment in Israeli politics, as he has been prime minister for a record-breaking total of more than 13 years.\n\nThe 69-year-old faces potential corruption charges in the weeks ahead, pending a hearing set for early October.\n\nGantz has in the past spoken of his refusal to serve in a government with an indicted prime minister. Nevertheless, he has not repeated that statement in recent days, beyond saying he should be the premier himself.", "description": "Joint List alliance endorse ex-military chief although say they don\u2019t support his policies", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d62ebe297a33838e650914953a15023c3bd45808/0_181_4464_2678/master/4464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=68912d81f0b4605b708c9f5381e3bd01", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
