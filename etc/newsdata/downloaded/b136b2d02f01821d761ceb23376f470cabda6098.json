Rand Paul (R-KY) took aim at several unnamed Republican senators on Monday night, telling Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson that many of his GOP colleagues are more loyal to the so-called \u201cDeep State\u201d than to the president while criticizing Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for not doing more to investigate Democrats.\n\nNoting at the top of his primetime Fox News broadcast that Graham promised to use his chairmanship of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee to get to the bottom of the Russia investigation, Carlson groused that the South Carolina lawmaker hadn\u2019t made any progress exposing the \u201cbureaucratic coup\u201d against President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cSo far, Graham\u2019s tenure has been defined by total inaction,\u201d Carlson grumbled. \u201cHe has subpoenaed neither [former Deputy FBI Director Andrew] McCabe nor [ex-Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein, nor has he launched an investigation. Now his inaction extends to the Ukraine saga.\u201d\n\nPaul, meanwhile, claimed that he has urged Graham both publicly and privately to open up investigations and bring in people such as former CIA Director John Brennan and former British counterintelligence officer Christopher Steele to testify about the origins of the Russia probe.\n\n\u201cSo everything the Democrats have accused President Trump of doing, you know, investigating a political rival with a foreign country, all those same questions should be asked of the Democrats,\u201d Paul exclaimed. \u201cDid they do that to Trump?\u201d\n\nCarlson wanted to know why Graham hasn\u2019t moved on opening a Senate investigation into this, prompting Paul to say that the South Carolina lawmaker needs to exercise his power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting a long time on this,\u201d Paul continued. \u201cSome people, I\u2019m not going to say Senator Graham, but there are other Republican senators up here whose allegiance is more to the Deep State than it is to the president. I do think Senator Graham does like the president and wants to get to the bottom of it, but a lot of us want to see it get started. We want to see subpoenas.\u201d\n\nThe Fox News host went on to complain that Graham hasn\u2019t looked into the FBI raid on Trump associate Roger Stone\u2019s house, implying that then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller tipped off CNN ahead of time. (CNN has contended that this is untrue.)\n\n\u201cHe needs to use his clout, and only he can do it,\u201d Paul replied.\n\nCarlson would then ask Paul if Graham\u2019s neoconservative views on foreign policy have caused him to possibly slow-walk the investigations, wondering if Graham\u2019s disagreements with Trump on Syria are affecting his decisions.\n\n\u201cThere is an establishment in foreign policy and also in the intelligence community,\u201d Paul noted. \u201cThe intelligence community truly is the Deep State.\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky senator concluded that he and Graham have had disagreements in the past over FISA warrants, adding that Graham wants to continue having them issued in private.\n\n\u201cThere may be a concern that if we look at the intelligence Deep State, that as we find out things, some of their power may diminish,\u201d He said.\n\nCarlson, meanwhile, wasn\u2019t the only pro-Trump Fox personality who railed against Graham\u2014typically a reliable supporter of the president\u2014on Monday night. During his Fox Business broadcast, Lou Dobbs called Graham an \u201cembarrassment\u201d who hasn\u2019t \u201clifted a finger\u201d to help Trump.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
