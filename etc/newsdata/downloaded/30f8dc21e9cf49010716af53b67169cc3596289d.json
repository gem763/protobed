Powell called a recess in the Broward jail courtroom, where she sets bonds and release conditions, not hear evidence or try the cases.\n\nAccording to court records, Green, 27, was arrested Tuesday on a battery charge. He was accused of attacking a worker at a mental hospital.\n\nChase was taken to Broward Health Medical Center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing OK,\u201d she told the news outlet as she left the hospital. The attack \u201cwas a bit of a shock,\u201d she added. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d\n\nGordon Weekes, the executive chief assistant of the Broward County Public Defender\u2019s Office, described Chase as a \u201cvery dedicated attorney.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is very unfortunate what happened this morning,\u201d he told the Sun-Sentinel.\n\n\u201cHe [Green] seemed to be in a clear psychotic state and he was arrested for battering a [hospital] technician, attacking him from the back,\u201d Weekes added.\n\nHe questioned why Green was removed from a facility that could treat any mental health condition he might have.\n\n\u201cThere was a big push to have officers trained to deal with crises, trained to identify folks with mental-health illnesses, trained to make better decisions about who they were going to arrest and it seems like going into a hospital to arrest someone who is acting out in a psychotic state, consistent with their psychosis, only seems to transfer the issue to the jail,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor our attorney to take the brunt of the failures of law enforcement \u2026is unacceptable.\u201d", "description": "A man facing a battery charge slugged a public defender in the head during a court appearance in Florida.", "authors": ["March"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/court-punch-wp-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-03-27"}
