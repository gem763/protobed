I\u2019m not referring here to the usual suspects \u2013 I know there isn\u2019t a Jewish conspiracy, because I\u2019ve never been invited along to any of its meetings, any more than I have to those of the so-called establishment, and since my Wiki entry fingers me as both a Jew and an arch-establishmentarian, I know that at least these things must be true.\n\nNor, indeed, is this a conspiracy of the believers against the secular, the ugly contra the lovely, lizard-paedophiles averse to\u2026 everyone, or the rich versus the poor. As to our fates being determined by some weird historic determinism, whereby humanity \u201crealises\u201d itself through successive class antagonisms... Nope, sorry Jezzer. Far from being wreathed in false consciousness, the cabal I\u2019m talking about hide in plain view \u2013 and perhaps the best way I have of getting you to eat the proverbial red pill, and so see for the first time the true horror that enfolds you, is for me to describe a group of these evil svengalis I saw only yesterday evening, outside a pub in Mortlake, south-west London.\n\nTrue, they aren\u2019t an especially metropolitan phenomenon \u2013 but can be found anywhere human society tries to flourish. Nevertheless, there is a certain kind of affluent-but-slightly-quirky suburb, exemplified by Mortlake, and often featuring mean-featured little Victorian villas, that seems to attract them. There they were: two women sporting boldly patterned pregnancy dresses, their men folk in khaki cargo shorts and collared T-shirts. All were talking animatedly \u2013 one of the men was actually stroking his jazz beard as I hurried past, my face averted. I refer, of course, to people in their 40s.\n\nYes: forget whatever ologies you may have studied along the way, demography is the only science that matters when it comes to the harsh terms of everyone\u2019s existence (everyone who isn\u2019t currently aged between 40 and 49, that is), for this is the cohort that has it all. St George of Orwell said \u201cby the age of 50 every man has the face he deserves\u201d \u2013 but the truth is, rather, \u201cby the age of 50 every man and woman has the fate he or she deserves\u201d, because, let\u2019s face it, with one or two exceptions if you haven\u2019t cut the mustard by then it\u2019s cress sandwiches all the way into that perfect picnic spot: your grave.\n\nYes, yes, I know: for a long while now it\u2019s looked as if our main problem was the bizarre demographic boul\u00e9vers\u00e9ment that\u2019s happened in the past 70 very odd years. I\u2019m not the only Nytol-addled Nostradamus to have pointed out that if current trends persist our few remaining young folk will, soon enough, be crushed to death beneath the huge prolapsed denim-covered collective arse of superannuated baby boomerdom. Nor have I been alone when it comes to bemoaning the talentless hipster culture we\u2019ve bequeathed our children \u2013 we\u2019ve all seen it happen: the once proud artistic avant gardes of western Europe plummeting through clouds of frothy coffee, down into a brownish gloop comprising one part \u201ccrafted\u201d gin to three of moustache wax.\n\nIf Johnson appears decadent, it\u2019s because he is channelling his own inner 45-year-old\n\nWhile there were still some baby boomers left in our 40s, I thought we were the problem \u2013 but now I know the hideous truth: it doesn\u2019t matter that David Cameron turned 50 a few months after leaving office, or, for that matter, that Nick \u201cBend over for Zuckerberg\u201d Clegg reached that noble age early the next year \u2013 the point is: there are always more ready to follow them: dead-eyed thirtysomethings on the verge of becoming the true Illuminati! Yes, yes, I know: the current prime minister is 55 \u2013 but if he resembles an amoral and Struwwelpeter-haired puppet, it\u2019s because he is one, manipulated by Dominic Cummings (47). And if Johnson, with his bellowing, pants-down antics, also appears decadent \u2013 in the true sense of aping the mores of 10 years past \u2013 it\u2019s because he is indeed channelling his own inner 45-year-old.\n\nYes, those in their 40s have the swaggering self-confidence of people-who\u2019ve-arrived, but far from this destination being the dark wood that inspired Dante to deep spiritual reflection, theirs is the smugness of those whose position in the hierarchy is well established, plus the antics of the boorish teenagers they so clearly remain. See them paint their faces and go to Glastonbury! See them disappear into a k-hole while actually eating Special K to ease their costive and ageing bowels! Moreover, with advances in the technology of human fertilisation, fortysomethings are now able to reproduce themselves \u2013 which accounts for the creepily philoprogenitive group on the riverside at Mortlake.\n\nWhen I swallowed the red pill and saw them for the first time in all their old-young hideousness, it occurred to me: is it only this generation of 40-year-olds that\u2019s quite so repulsive (and quite so powerful), or has this Masonic order of the middle-aged always been so smugly unreflective? True, the current incumbents are a grisly bunch \u2013 but what can you expect of people whose cultural hinterland has been formed by the likes of Coldplay and Radiohead, and who came of age listening to the peculiar banging whine of dial-up internet connections, as, feverishly, they waited to play some dumb and wholly unrealistic computer game?\n\nGranted, I do have this obvious partisanship \u2013 and there\u2019s also a further objection to my thesis: that I approach the issue with a perspective warped by my own 57 (and rising) years. But let me reassure you: when I recall how smugly self-satisfied I was in my own 40s \u2013 and how convinced I was of the importance of me and my fellow quadragenarians, well, I can tell you: I feel like giving that fellow a few sharp slaps in his metro-moisturised face, until it shines like a baby\u2019s bottom. Or, alternatively, like the face of David Cameron, who, as I believe I may have made clear, is the leader of the fortysomethings\u2019 revolution, and whose inappropriate Chelsea boot heel we\u2019re all still being ground beneath.", "description": "It used to be the baby boomers who were the problem \u2013 no longer", "authors": ["Will Self"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1885dccefe8c23086b4f6962a5dbdec08ee6c66a/0_25_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=287b76dd3485d7642818bc7243f18f17"}
