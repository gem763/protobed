But this season, things got even more logistically complex when the company began the first regular Sunday matinees in its history, seeking to reverse its recent box office struggles by performing when modern audiences find it convenient. The new schedule means that the Met sometimes mounts four different productions in the 48 hours between Friday and Sunday evening \u2014 a truly herculean task that the company performs on a scale that is unusual, if not unique, in the world.\n\n\u201cI would say we\u2019re alone in this mad pursuit,\u201d Peter Gelb, the Met\u2019s general manager, said on a recent Friday afternoon, as the marathon was about to begin.\n\nIt is a staggering undertaking.\n\nFour casts got in and out of 718 costumes over the weekend, with the help of 37 dressers. They wore 201 wigs that had each been prepared \u2014 and in some cases rewashed, curled and reset \u2014 by hair and makeup artists. A stage crew of 178 was needed each day to build, move and strike the mammoth sets, which are so huge that the Met measures their volume by the number of 40-foot truck containers it takes to store them: \u201cMadama Butterfly\u201d is 14 truckloads; \u201cTurandot,\u201d a whopping 26; \u201cManon,\u201d 13; and \u201cOrfeo ed Euridice,\u201d 12.\n\nFinding space backstage is like playing one of those sliding tile games. \u201cIt often feels like we\u2019re playing that game,\u201d said David Feheley, the Met\u2019s technical director. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the empty square.\u201d", "description": "With its new Sunday matinees, the Metropolitan Opera now mounts four productions between Friday and Sunday.
