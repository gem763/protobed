Guests sat at small cafe tables as influencers and other non-models walked with the real ones down a gravel catwalk.\n\nNicola Glass, marking her first full year as creative director, said the idea Saturday was to celebrate the city\u2019s green spaces and offer guests the experience of people watching in a New York City cafe. Debi Mazar and her daughter, Evelina Maria Corcos, were among the walkers. So was \u201cGood Boys\u201d actress Molly Gordon.\n\nAlways keeping the Kate Spade DNA in mind, Glass reimagined safari-wear in ultra-feminine fabrics, prints and colors. Pink and orange graphics adorned the front of jumpers in lavender and teal. A double-slit gown that skimmed the gravel was printed with leaves of white, teal, pink and orange.\n\nGlass showed a fall coat in moss green with a playful dot-like lining. A forest green trouser and top set was done in an open floral lace. Some who walked held potted plants and other greenery, and guests went home with plants of their own.\n\nThis was the fifth collection for Glass.\n\n\u201cKate Spade as a brand has always had a really broad range of women in their marketing and advertising, but it\u2019s the first time in a runway show that we\u2019ve really brought a broad range of women walking the shows,\u201d she told The Associated Press.\n\nRoberts is a longtime fan.\n\n\u201cI just love how girly Kate Spade is,\u201d she said. \u201cI always feel very girly and feminine and sometimes that\u2019s just the best way to feel when you are on a carpet or even street style.\u201d\n\nSink, who appears in \u201cStranger Things,\u201d agreed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always loved Kate Spade ever since I was little. It was kind of one of those brands that is just so feminine and fun, and I think fashion should be fun,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kate Spade took its New York Fashion Week guests on a city safari.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ragan Clark"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
