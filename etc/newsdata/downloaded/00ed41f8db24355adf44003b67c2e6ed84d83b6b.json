Beto O\u2019Rourke courts the cameras by barking out the F-word\u2014and selling T-shirts displaying his vulgar quote. At the August debate, Bill de Blasio and Tulsi Gabbard grasped for a boost in the polls by launching Trump-like demagogic attacks on the front-runners. Trump showed America that political experience doesn\u2019t count for Republicans; Pete Buttigieg, Andrew Yang, and Marianne Williamson are trying to convince us that it doesn\u2019t matter for Democrats either\u2014or is even a liability.\n\nOthers, though, are betting that the public wants a return to normalcy, including a restoration of civility in our public life and dignity in the Oval Office. Joe Biden\u2019s evocations of working with \u201cBarack,\u201d Elizabeth Warren\u2019s reminders that presidents are supposed to know policy, and Kamala Harris\u2019s dignified defense of her record convey that we should again have a president who stirs our nobler instincts. One who isn\u2019t unpresidential.\n\nPresidents are, by definition, presidential. Clearly, however, Trump has scrambled, at least for now, what that word means. In the past few weeks alone, he\u2019s called the Federal Reserve Board governors \u201cboneheads,\u201d cashiered his third national security adviser in as many years (with a tweet), and doctored a weather map on national TV. From the start of his campaign in 2015, it was evident that Trump would struggle to meet most traditional definitions of presidential behavior. As a candidate, he made fun of the idea that he couldn\u2019t do so, although in the process he refuted his own point. \u201cPresidential is easy,\u201d he insisted at a Connecticut campaign rally in 2016, striding formally around the podium and affecting a stiff one. \u201cLadies and gentlemen of Waterbury, it\u2019s a great honor to be with you this morning.\u201d But he looked like a clown.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Greenberg", "Theatlantic.Com Ideas Archive Nothing-And-Everything-Presidential"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
