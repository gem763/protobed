Bridget\u2019s funny nature is what Coon loves best about the role, and she relished the chance to stretch beyond what casting agents tend to like her for.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cIf you know my work, you know that people don\u2019t typically think of me when they\u2019re going to direct a comedy,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nCoon was drawn to recording a podcast by \u201cthe idea that there are people out there who might think differently than the Hollywood machine thinks\u201d, she says. And that freedom and the chance to play against type in juicy, well-written roles are attracting more and more movie, TV and theatre actors to this growing medium.\n\nSo far this year, Rami Malek has played a radio DJ and father of two in Blackout; Cynthia Erivo has become a long-haul trucker who is accidentally caught up in a bioterrorism scheme in Carrier and Jenny Slate has starred in a one-woman alien-apocalypse thriller called Earth Break. This month, Kelly Marie Tran is the lead in Passenger List, a mystery thriller about a flight that disappears between London and New York. Cliff Smith, aka Method Man, of Wu-Tang Clan, will portray a gritty investigative journalist in the Stitcher Premium production of Marvel\u2019s 1994 comic book MARVELS. And joining Coon in Motherhacker are Alan Cumming, Lucas Hedges, Rupert Friend and Pedro Pascal.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities are more limitless, or as limited as my own voice is,\u201d Coon says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be really fun to see if I can push myself to be regarded in a new way in a new format.\u201d\n\nFor the makers of fictional podcasts, the casting of well-known names helps their shows break through the clutter and, it is hoped, reach mainstream entertainment audiences. For example, when Gimlet released its first fiction podcast, Homecoming, in 2016, every voice was familiar: Catherine Keener, David Schwimmer, Oscar Isaac, David Cross, Amy Sedaris. (Such star power can also help turn those properties into movies or television shows.)\n\nMimi O\u2019Donnell, executive producer of fiction at Gimlet, which this year was bought by Spotify, says her task was to balance the celebrity quotient with the requirements for the parts the creative team is casting.\n\n\u201cObviously, a big name highlights podcasts at a time when podcasts, especially fiction podcasts, are reaching saturation,\u201d O\u2019Donnell says. \u201cBut then also making sure that they\u2019re right for the part,\u201d she adds, referring to the actors. \u201cThat\u2019s the key, not to feel like we\u2019re going to package this together with big names if they\u2019re not right.\u201d\n\nSince Homecoming, the company has produced shows like The Horror of Dolores Roach, starring Daphne Ruben-Vega and Bobby Cannavale; Sandra, starring Alia Shawkat and Kristen Wiig; and The Two Princes, a children\u2019s adventure podcast that has gay themes and overflows with Broadway actors like Noah Galvin and Tony Award winners Christine Baranski and Ari\u2019el Stachel.\n\nThe podcast producers have found willing collaborators in the worlds of film, TV and theatre.\n\n\u201cNobody has asked me so far to run around and punch aliens in the face,\u201d said Slate, the Earth Break star, who does the voices of several cartoon children in Big Mouth and Bob\u2019s Burgers and has had lead roles in movies like Obvious Child. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked a million times over to be a pregnant lady, a comedian or a Jewish person, and in life I\u2019ve been two out of three of those things \u2013 a comedian and a Jewish person. I just wanted to do something different.\u201d\n\nWhat podcasts lack \u2013 a pricey visual component \u2013 is the very thing that makes the medium such a rich opportunity for performers.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 27 films and TV shows that were forced to change their title Show all 27 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

But the title Annie Hall was eventually settled on, inspired by actress Diane Keaton's real name, Diane Hall, and her nickname, Annie. United Artists 2/27 Dynasty (1981-89) Original title: Oil Oil The hit series, which revolves around the family of an oil magnate, was originally supposed to be titled\u2026 wait for it\u2026 Oil. But it was then changed to Dynasty to compete with rival soap Dallas. CBS Television Distribution 3/27 Back to the Future (1985) Original title: Spaceman from Pluto Spaceman from Pluto Steven Spielberg genuinely thought the title Spaceman from Pluto was a joke suggestion, so it didn\u2019t last long, and was soon replaced by the now iconic name Back to the Future. He contacted the Universal Studios head Sid Sheinberg who had suggested the Pluto title, with a message thanking him for sending his wonderful \"joke\" name, saying the office \"got a kick out of it\". Ouch. Universal Pictures 4/27 The Breakfast Club (1985) Original title: The Lunch Bunch The Lunch Bunch The original script for this classic high-school movie went by the very naff name The Lunch Bunch, but thanks to the son of one of director John Hughes's friends, who had a school detention class called The Breakfast Club, the title was changed. Universal Pictures 5/27 Fatal Attraction (1987) Original title: Affairs of the Heart Affairs of the Heart The much friendlier sounding Affairs of the Heart wasn\u2019t a great match for the psychological thriller that brought us the bunny boiler, and after it received a poor reception from audiences, the film\u2019s title was changed to Fatal Attraction. Paramount Pictures 6/27 Licence to Kill (1989) Original title: Licence Revoked Licence Revoked This Bond film was, at one time, called Licence Revoked, but test audiences associated the title too much with driving, so thankfully it was changed to something far punchier. United Artists 7/27 Saved by the Bell (1989-93) Original title: Good Morning, Miss Bliss Good Morning, Miss Bliss NBC\u2019s Good Morning Miss Bliss centred on Hayley Mills as the eponymous teacher but, after the comedy briefly moved to the Disney Channel and then back to NBC, it was re-tooled to focus on the teenage students instead, therefore taking on a new name: Saved By The Bell. CBS Studios International 8/27 Goodfellas (1990) Original title: Wiseguy Wiseguy The Scorsese classic is an adaptation of a mobster novel called Wiseguy, which was originally also the title of the film, but the name had to be changed because it had already been taken for an 80s TV series. Warner Bros 9/27 Pretty Woman (1990) Original title: 3000 3000 Originally a dark drama about class and sex work, Pretty Woman\u2019s first title was 3,000 \u2013 the amount of money that Richard Gere's character Edward spends on a week of Vivian's (Julia Roberts) time. Disney changed the name as it came across as \u201ctoo science-fictiony\u201d, as well as the tone of the movie which was turned into a rom-com fairytale. Buena Vista Pictures 10/27 Friends (1994-2004) Original title: Six of One Six of One The beloved sitcom went through many different name changes, with all the following titles considered: Friends Like Us, Six of One, Across the Hall, Once Upon a Time in the West Village, and Insomnia Cafe. It\u2019s now hard to imagine the show becoming such a monumental hit with any of those names. Warner Bros Television Distribution 11/27 Pulp Fiction (1994) Original title: Black Mask Black Mask Pulp Fiction was initially inspired by the detective crime stories in the seminal magazine Black Mask, hence its first name. The publication was a pulp magazine, which goes some way to explaining the new title. Miramax Films 12/27 Titanic (1997) Original title: The Ship of Dreams The Ship of Dreams In a line from the classic 1997 film, the older version of Rose says: \"Titanic was called the ship of dreams, and it was, it really was.\" It was also the original title of the film, before the simpler name of Titanic was chosen. 20th Century Fox 13/27 That '70s Show (1998-2006) Original title: Teenage Wasteland Teenage Wasteland Early ideas for the 70s sitcom\u2019s name included Teenage Wasteland and The Kids Are Alright, but because the creators couldn\u2019t get song title rights from The Who, they were forced to change the name of the show. Carsey-Werner Distribution 14/27 American Pie (1999) Original title: Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But the Executive Will Hate It was a bold move from screenwriter Adam Herz when he submitted his spec script to studios under the title Teenage Sex Comedy That Can Be Made For Under $10 Million That Your Reader Will Love But The Executive Will Hate. But the risk paid off, with the film, eventually named American Pie, grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars worldwide. Universal Pictures 15/27 Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) Original title: Dairy Queens Dairy Queens The black comedy was originally supposed to be called Dairy Queens. However, the company that owns fast food chain Dairy Queen apparently didn't love the idea of being associated with the movie, so they filed a lawsuit and, lo and behold, Drop Dead Gorgeous was born. New Line Cinema 16/27 8 Simple Rules (2002-03) Original title: 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter This family sitcom originally had a longer name, but when star John Ritter \u2013 who played the concerned father in the show \u2013 suddenly died after filming the third episode of the second series, the show changed its format and name to 8 Simple Rules and Ritter\u2019s death was written into the plot. Buena Vista International Television 17/27 Cars (2006) Original title: Route 66 Route 66 The animated hit was initially called Route 66 after the iconic road in America, but the title was changed to Cars to avoid confusion with a 60s TV show of the same name. Buena Vista Pictures 18/27 Hannah Montana (2006-11) Original title: Alexis Texas Alexis Texas Miley Cyrus\u2019s Disney comedy was originally called Alexis Texas but, because a porn actor shares the same name, it had to be changed in case children looked up the show\u2019s title and accidentally found pornography. Disney-ABC Domestic Television 19/27 The Big Bang Theory (2007-19) Original title: Lenny, Penny and Kenny Lenny, Penny and Kenny The Big Bang Theory\u2019s original rhyming title was forced to change after the character Kenny\u2019s name switched to Sheldon, who was then brought to life by Jim Parsons. Warner Bros Television Distribution 20/27 Samantha Who? (2007-09) Original title: Sam I Am Sam I Am Clearance issues with the estate of Dr Seuss led ABC to change the name of its Christina Applegate-led show, as the original title, Sam I Am, drew on the first lines of Dr Seuss\u2019s classic Green Eggs and Ham. Disney \u2013 ABC Domestic Television 21/27 The Good Wife (2009-16) Original title: Leave the Bastard Leave the Bastard The Good Wife\u2019s creators got a call from CBS pushing them to change the title just as it went into production. The network did actually consider Leave the Bastard, but ultimately decided to play it safe with The Good Wife. CBS Television Distribution 22/27 Shutter Island (2010) Original title: Ashecliffe Ashecliffe Ashecliffe, the name of the hospital in Martin Scorcese\u2019s thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was originally going to be the film\u2019s title before it was changed to Shutter Island. Paramount Pictures 23/27 New Girl (2011-18) Original title: Chicks and Dicks Chicks and Dicks New Girl was initially pitched as \"a young ensemble comedy about the sexual politics of men and women\u201d, hence its original, provocative title: Chicks and Dicks. Not only did this name attract the wrong kind of attention, but New Girl better reflected the content of the sitcom, which ended up revolving around Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Jess. 20th Television 24/27 Edge of Tomorrow (2014) Original title: All You Need Is Kill All You Need Is Kill The Tom Cruise action movie was originally known as All You Need Is Kill, the title of the book on which the movie is based, but filmmakers changed the title because they felt the word \"kill\" was too problematic. \"I think the word 'kill' in a title is very tricky in today's world\u2026\" producer Edwin Stoff said. \u201cWe see it enough in real newspaper headlines, and I don't think we need to see it when we're looking at a movie.\" After a lucklustre box office opening, the film's name was changed once again, in marketing and for home release, to Live, Die, Repeat. Warner Bros Pictures 25/27 Lovesick (2014-18) Original title: Scrotal Recall Scrotal Recall The relationship comedy drama starring Johnny Flynn was renamed after one series because, perhaps unsurprisingly, it was suffering from a lack of word of mouth, with people reluctant to say the word \u201cscrotal\u201d. Clerkenwell Films 26/27 Stranger Things (2016-) Original title: Montauk Montauk The original title of the Netflix hit was Montauk, as the plan had been for it to be set in a village of the same name in New York. However, when creators the Duffer brothers later relocated the show\u2019s action to the fictional town of Hawkins in Indiana, the name changed to Stranger Things. Intriguingly, Montauk also happens to be the title of a short film which the Duffer brothers were accused of plagiarising. Netflix 27/27 Arrival (2017) Original title: Story of Your Life Story of Your Life The sci-fi film starring Amy Adams originally went by the title of the novella it was based on, Story of Your Life, but because producer Shawn Levy thought it \"sounds a bit like a One Direction song\u201d and \"multiword titles can be really problematic\u201d, the movie changed its name to Arrival.

Paramount Pictures\n\n\u201cIt was all going to rely on the listener\u2019s imagination and then what I could provide as a voice actor,\u201d Slate says. \u201cTo literally divest myself of my actual form but still play a woman was really freeing. Not that I don\u2019t like how I look, but sometimes I get tired of people saying how they feel about it.\u201d\n\nIf Earth Break had been written for the screen, the story would have had to change into something reliably marketable to recoup the price tag of a production heavy with special effects. If its action-movie protagonist had been conceived as a tall blonde with an eight-pack, for instance, Slate says she \u201cwould have never even seen the script\u201d.\n\nThe flexibility of podcast productions is also appealing. Coon had to spend only three days in a downtown Brooklyn recording studio to voice Motherhacker. And Kelly Marie Tran recorded her starring role as Kaitlyn Le in Passenger List over 10 days in London while she filmed Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. (Patti LuPone was able to record her role with Tran the same week she opened in the musical Company on the West End in London last year.)\n\nTran also had more influence over the story than she would have had for a typical big-budget movie. The show\u2019s co-director, writer and producer, Lauren Shippen, went over every script with Tran to reflect the actress\u2019s experiences and insights as the daughter of first-generation Vietnamese immigrants.\n\nOne tweak Shippen made was when Kaitlyn returns home in the middle of trying to unearth the truth behind the flight\u2019s disappearance \u2013 her twin brother was on the plane \u2013 the scene is populated with Vietnamese actors actually speaking Vietnamese.\n\n\u201cWith Passenger List,\u2019 Kelly\u2019s in every single episode, basically in every single scene,\u201d Shippen says. \u201cAnd so it really makes sense to basically dig into a character voice with an actor when the actor is 70 per cent of a show.\u201d\n\nActors also enjoy another perk of audio-only performing: Coon jokes that her favourite parts of Motherhacker were the hours she didn\u2019t have to spend in hair and makeup.\n\nScreen and stage actors who are already fans of the medium, like Coon, a proud Murderino (a fan of My Favorite Murder, for the uninitiated), are thrilling to the wedding of their industries to the podcast-makers who have spent the past decade as innovators.\n\n\u201cFor me, it felt like being invited to the cool kids\u2019 party,\u201d Coon says. \u201cLike, suddenly, the popular kids were calling me, and they knew who I was.\u201d\n\nBut ultimately, the performance required isn\u2019t so different from that in a movie, a TV show or a play.\n\n\u201cYou never see yourself as that person, and you\u2019re not in a costume,\u201d Coon says. \u201cBut you still have to do all the things you have to do in your other jobs \u2013 cry, have an emotional breakdown \u2013 except you\u2019re alone in front of a microphone and you can\u2019t move. You have to be able to still reach down for what you need to supply in that moment to be truthful. And that\u2019s very challenging.\u201d\n\n7 More Podcasts for the autumn\n\nThis autumn, as the podcast boom shows no signs of flagging, new shows will take you on a lusty romp through celebrity culture, an exploration of American iconography and an investigation into why everybody loves Dolly Parton.\n\nThe Happiness Lab\n\nBased on Yale University\u2019s most popular class \u2013 ever, according to the university \u2013 psychology professor Laurie Santos explores the science of what happiness actually is, and how you should change your thinking about it.
