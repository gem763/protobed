There\u2019s no way we could have achieved such a beautiful finish as this.\n\nTheir new home (Picture: BBC)\n\nTara was left particularly emotional by the transformation (Picture: BBC)\n\n\u2018We\u2019re forever grateful for it as well. It\u2019s such a shock because it was such a derelict building for all those years.\u2019\n\nGetting emotional as the kids are shown the house for the first time, Tara said: \u2018We\u2019re going to be a family again. We\u2019re going to be back together.\u2019\n\nViewers couldn\u2019t hold back on the sobs either.\n\nDid anyone see #diysos with @nickknowles last night?
