Rogan lost one of the country\u2019s most expensive and closely watched races to a young Democrat named Adam Schiff\u2014who is, coincidentally, now one of the leading members investigating Trump as chair of the House Intelligence Committee. With those exceptions, Davis says, \u201cthere was no punishment\u201d for impeachment.\n\nRead: What Pelosi\u2019s pivot on impeachment really means\n\nYet Davis thinks Democrats in Trump-leaning districts could face more risk, simply because politics has grown more polarized and tribal in the two decades since Clinton\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThe parties are more ideologically sorted than they were before,\u201d says Davis, now a lobbyist in Washington. \u201cSecond, Trump is a personality cult, so I think his people take this a little more personally. And the third thing is [closer] proximity to the next election\u201d than the December 1998 impeachment vote was.\n\nThe other big difference is that, unlike Clinton, Trump will be on the ballot in 2020 (absent the unlikely event of enough Senate Republicans voting to remove him from office if the House does eventually impeach him.) \u201cThere is no escaping Trump,\u201d says Sarah Binder, a senior fellow in governance studies at Brookings. \u201cHe is the 800-pound elephant \u2026 There is no escaping his relevance to this election. It just seems that might be quite different than what happened in 2000 once you had Clinton departing from the scene.\u201d\n\nYet Binder is one of many analysts who think Trump-district Democrats could face only modest risks even if the House does impeach him. That\u2019s partly because she thinks the Ukraine allegations are easier for voters to comprehend than the complex, carefully hedged report on Russian interference in the 2016 election produced by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cThese folks in these districts\u2014they have a little bit of wind in their back because the Ukraine issue seems a little more tangible, a little more understandable,\u201d she says.\n\nOther analysts point to Trump\u2019s uncertain position even in the Democratic-held districts that he carried. Trump was hardly a colossus in those 31 seats in 2016: He exceeded 51 percent of the vote in only six of them, and reached 50 or 51 percent in just seven more. He beat Hillary Clinton while drawing less than half of the total vote in 18 of those seats.\n\nThat distinction hasn\u2019t escaped the Democratic members in those districts: By the time Pelosi made her announcement on Tuesday afternoon, 10 of the 18 Democrats from districts where Trump won with less than half of the vote had endorsed an impeachment inquiry. By comparison, at that point, only four of the members from the 13 Democratic-held seats where Trump did reach a majority had joined the call for impeachment proceedings, according to the tracker maintained by Politico.", "description": "The release of an internal whistleblower complaint about President Trump\u2019s relationship with Ukraine immediately appeared to harden House Democrats\u2019 determination.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19267780660907/facebook.jpg?1569508067", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
