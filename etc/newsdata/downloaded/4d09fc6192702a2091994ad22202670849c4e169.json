But in 2019 and 2020, it proposed cutting the program by 40% and allocating just $3 million to it.\n\nThe initiative includes several other programs, including criminal justice assistance, demand reduction, drug supply reduction, global crime and drugs policy, combating cyber crime and organized crime, aviation support, international peacekeeping operations, and program development.\n\nThe State Department also proposed cuts to some of those programs, including demand reduction and fighting organized crime.\n\nThe agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, continues claiming his conversation with Zelensky about Biden was innocent and purely focused on curbing corruption.\n\nRead more: There's a 2nd whistleblower complaint no one's talking about, and it could be as damaging to Trump as the Ukraine scandal\n\nBut a US intelligence official who filed an explosive whistleblower complaint against Trump based on the call said it was more about the US president soliciting foreign interference from Ukraine ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nThe complaint spurred House Democratic lawmakers to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump following months of intra-party warfare over whether the move was too drastic.\n\nTrump has taken an increasingly combative stance since, by lobbing attacks against Democrats and accusing them of orchestrating a \"coup,\" saying the whistleblower and those investigating him are guilty of treason, and amplifying suggestions that the country will break out in to a \"civil war\" if he's impeached.\n\nOn Thursday, he doubled down on his calls to investigate Bidens, and this time drew China into it as well.\n\n\"China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,\" Trump said on the White House lawn. \"So, I would say that President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens.\"\n\nThere's no evidence of wrongdoing or illegal activity on the part of either Biden in Ukraine or China, despite the president's allegations.", "description": "The Trump administration put $5 million toward the program last year.
