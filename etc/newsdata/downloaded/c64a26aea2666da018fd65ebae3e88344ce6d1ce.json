They might not get two runs against Verlander in the opening inning again but they seem like a good bet to get at least a hit.\n\nPICK: Top 1st inning hit - Yes (-120)\n\nFIRST FIVE INNINGS\n\nStrasburg had an excellent regular season going 18-6 with a 3.32 ERA and 1.04 WHIP. He's been even more effective in the postseason going 4-0 in five outings with a 1.93 ERA and 0.96 WHIP.\n\nVerlander has struggled in the postseason going 1-3 in five starts with a 4.15 ERA but there's a reason he's likely head to the Hall of Fame after his career ends. He had a terrific regular season going 21-6 with a 2.58 ERA, a 0.80 WHIP and a batting average allowed of .172.\n\nEven though Verlander and Strasburg allowed a total of four runs in the first inning last week, they settled down immediately after that with neither pitcher giving up a single run over the next five innings. Back the Under on the first five innings total.\n\nPICK: First Five Innings Under 4\n\nTEAM/PLAYER PROP\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Verlander hasn't always been at his best this postseason the O/U of 7.5 on his strikeout total still seems too low. In the regular season he fanned 300 batters in 223 innings for an average of 11.9 strikeouts per nine innings. He also struck out at least 10 batters in 10 of his last 14 starts to close out the season.\n\nEven in the postseason Verlander has thrown at least eight strikeouts in three of his five starts. With Washington batters striking out an average of 9.53 times per game in the playoffs, take the Over here.\n\nPICK: Justin Verlander Over 7.5 strikeouts (+100)\n\nFULL GAME TOTAL\n\nWe're leaning towards the Under on the first five innings, but what about the full game total? While the Nationals' bullpen has been their biggest weakness for much of the year, the in-season addition of Daniel Hudson has helped shore up that area. And with Strasburg coming off five days of rest he can throw deep into the game if effective, after all he has pitched at least seven innings in 12 of his last 28 starts.\n\nWhen it comes to the Astros relievers, they have one of the best bullpens in the majors, recording a 3.75 ERA during the regular season and a 3.91 ERA in the postseason.\n\nAs for the batters on both sides, scoring has not come as easy for these squads during the playoffs as it did during the regular season. In the postseason Washington is batting .239 and plating 4.33 runs per game, while Houston has a .235 BAA and is scoring 4.19 runs/game.\n\nWith the total set at a reasonable 7.5 we like the Under.\n\nPICK: Under 7.5\n\nFULL GAME SIDE\n\nInterestingly enough, the road team has won every game of this series and the visiting Nationals will be extremely motivated to win this one and push this series to a deciding seventh game.\n\nWhile Verlander is terrific on the mound, he has struggled in the postseason, with poor performances against the Rays, Yankees and Nationals. While we expect him to bounce back in this one he doesn't seem to have an edge on Strasburg when it comes to current form which makes us a bit wary of backing the 'Stros at -180.\n\nAs you can tell with our total bet, we're expecting this to be a low-scoring battle and when it comes to low-scoring contests the underdog usually has a decent chance of pulling off the victory. With Washington 7-0 in Strasburg's last seven outings we like their value at +155.\n\nPICK: Moneyline Washington +155", "description": "We break down the odds with our best bets and predictions for what could be the final game of the 2019 MLB World Series.
