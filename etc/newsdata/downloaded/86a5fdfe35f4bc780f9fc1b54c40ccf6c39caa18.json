Here\u2019s why.", "language": "en", "text": "It\u2019s known in the British parliamentary tradition as a minority government, and it\u2019s actually quite common. One-third of Canadian governments have been minorities in the last 30 years.\n\nA party trying to govern with a minority in the House of Commons can either cooperate with smaller parties to pass bills or browbeat them, essentially daring the weaker party to trigger an election.\n\nThese unstable parliaments tend to last about two years but can actually be quite productive amid the chaos. One particularly active series of minority parliaments in the 1960s introduced old-age pensions, a version of Medicare, the precursor to the current Canada-U.S. free trade agreement and the modern Canadian flag.\n\nOne of Canada\u2019s best-known experts on the parliamentary system, Philippe Lagass\u00e9, says minority governments can keep going because few politicians have an appetite for another election. Parties are usually too cash-strapped to campaign again, and losing parties are often too distracted by their own internal nomination fights.\n\n\u201cIt creates a real incentive to keep this thing going for a while,\u201d said Lagass\u00e9, a professor at Carleton University\u2018s Paterson School in Ottawa.\n\nAs POLITICO outlined, there are five possible scenarios that could emerge out of the election, but some form of minority government seems most likely. The latest polls indicate that neither the Liberal Party nor the Conservative Party will win the 170 votes in Monday\u2019s election to hold the majority outright.\n\nPierre Trudeau (right), seen here greeting U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in 1974, governed Canada as part of a minority government in the early 1970s.

In such an alliance, the NDP might demand more expensive, single-payer universal prescription drug coverage in exchange for a promise to keep Trudeau in office.\n\n\u201cI can certainly imagine the Liberals and NDP doing [a deal],\u201d said David Moscrop, a political theorist at the University of Ottawa. \u201cI think there would be some pressure to sign an agreement.\u201d\n\nTrudeau may even be able to maneuver into a minority government without winning the most seats. He could choose not to resign and team up with party No. 3 to form a majority \u2014 although it would be unconventional, and certainly controversial, if Trudeau and the NDP tried such a move. Trudeau himself once disparaged the idea of a losers\u2019 coalition.\n\nA far more conventional approach would see the party with the most seats trying to govern alone with no formal ally.\n\nThe minority party could seek to cut deals on a case-by-case basis, passing bills with the help of different parties. For example, Trudeau might seek NDP support on one of his main campaign promises, a prescription drug bill. He could then get the Conservatives\u2019 votes to ratify the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nIf Andrew Scheer and the Conservatives take over, they\u2019re expected to take the go-it-alone route. They have no natural ally in Parliament, especially on an issue they\u2019ve made central in their campaign: undoing Trudeau\u2019s carbon tax and climate policies and encouraging oil-and-gas development.\n\nBut many of the Conservative Party\u2019s other campaign promises could easily find support in Parliament \u2014 such as stricter data privacy rules for tech companies and targeted tax policies aimed at families like tax credits for sports equipment.\n\nEither the Conservatives or Liberals could also govern in the minority with a confrontational approach.\n\nThe smaller parties are sometimes so desperate to avoid an election that they\u2019ll accept embarrassing indignities and still keep the government afloat.\n\nTake the last Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, who ran two minority governments. He regularly browbeat his opponents into passing his agenda, because they were more afraid of an election than he was.\n\nA very unlikely, but not unheard of, result is a formal coalition government, in which different parties share seats in the executive branch.\n\nThough common in nations governed by parliamentary systems, a formal coalition hasn\u2019t been in place in Canada in over 100 years. The last time was during World War I, when members of Parliament who favored the draft banded together to form their own Cabinet.\n\nIn such a case, the smaller party, likely the NDP, might get some seats at the Cabinet and gain serious influence over the daily government operations. It\u2019s what happened in the U.K. a few years ago, when the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats teamed up to form one government.\n\nA basic principle of what\u2019s called the Westminster system is that members of the executive branch remain united; any disagreements that might occur around the Cabinet table are kept secret.\n\nYet these parties know that in the not-too-distant future, they\u2019ll be bashing each other again in another election and arguing about the government\u2019s track record.\n\n\u201cIt gets really messy in the Canadian system just because we\u2019re not used to it,\u201d Lagass\u00e9 said.\n\n\u201cIn a county like Canada, where governments tend to be very secretive and don\u2019t disclose a lot of information and guard their secrets very aggressively, to suddenly have another party that you\u2019re continually competing with, in the room with you, making decisions, is something we tend to not do,\u201d Lagass\u00e9 said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done. It\u2019s just much more complicated.\u201d\n\nMinority governments fall in one of four ways, Lagass\u00e9 said.\n\nThe first test is the throne speech, somewhat like the State of the Union address in the United States, that opens the new Parliament.\n\nIf it\u2019s defeated in a vote so soon, another party might try forming a government to avoid an immediate election.\n\nAnother way to lose power is if the minority government loses a vote on spending money. A government can also collapse in a vote on a motion declaring non-confidence. Or it could fail if the government declares something a matter of confidence and loses the vote on it.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s father, Pierre, led one type of minority government and defeated another type. When he was in opposition, he had announced plans to retire before his rivals tried to govern alone \u2014 and it backfired.\n\nHaving just arrived in office and facing a weakened Liberal Party organizing to replace Pierre Trudeau, the Conservatives in 1979 tried ramming through a budget bill and assumed it would pass. It failed.\n\nThey were toppled after just nine months. Trudeau came out of retirement, won a fourth term in office and capped his career by overhauling the Canadian constitution.\n\nBut it was another, earlier episode that could prove eerily similar to the fate awaiting his son on Monday. Pierre Trudeau\u2019s towering first-term popularity had collapsed. After a suspenseful election night, he scraped along, barely clinging to power.\n\nPierre Trudeau got help from the NDP for two years, from 1972 to 1974.\n\nTheir alliance crumbled after two years. Trudeau correctly surmised he could win another election and shrugged off the NDP\u2019s demands in a budget bill.\n\nThe NDP\u2019s leader, David Lewis, called his erstwhile ally arrogant and brought Trudeau down.\n\n\u201cHe thought we were frightened about an election,\u201c Lewis said. \u201c He was crazy. We\u2019re not.\u201d Lewis promised a campaign for lower living costs against his friend-turned-rival.\n\nThe episode exemplifies the inherent instability of life with minority governments: Within two years or so, even the friendliest alliance can end in acrimony and a new election.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/64/e6/812b3f0246d99e4e51723c365725/191018-canada-parliament-hill-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
