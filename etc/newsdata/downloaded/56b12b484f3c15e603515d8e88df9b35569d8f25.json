Giuliani abruptly canceled plans Friday to make a paid appearance at an upcoming event sponsored by the Russian government.\n\nMr. Giuliani backed out of next week\u2019s summit of the Eurasian Economic Union in Armenia within hours of his participation being reported by The Washington Post earlier Friday.\n\nThe official program for the event said that Mr. Giuliani was scheduled to take part in a panel discussion moderated by Sergey Glazyev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that conference attendees were likely to include Mr. Putin and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, among others.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Putin was going,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said after canceling, The Post reported. \u201cDiscretion is the better part of valor.\u201d\n\nEstablished by Mr. Putin in 2014 and headquartered in Moscow, the Eurasian Economic Union is a regional trade alliance effectively acting as a counterpart to the European Union. Its membership is composed exclusively of five former Soviet state \u2013 Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia \u2013 and the website for next week\u2019s forum lists the Russian government\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade as an official supporter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the website,\u201d Mr. Giuliani told the Post late Friday. \u201cI thought I was speaking at an Armenian security conference.\u201d\n\nNews of Mr. Giuliani\u2019s involvement emerged as both the president and his personal lawyer face growing scrutiny over recent revelations involving Ukraine, another former Soviet state that has been on the receiving end of Russian aggression since early 2014.\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged this week that he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July to speak with Mr. Giuliani about investigating Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and members of Congress pushing for Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment have accused him of purposely withholding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military aid from Ukraine as leverage.\n\nMr. Glazyev, the Kremlin adviser slated to moderate the panel that was to feature Mr. Giuliani, was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government over his involvement in the Russian military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nMr. Giuliani had been the only American scheduled to participate in the conference before canceling.\n\nBoth the White House and State Department declined to comment, The Washington Post reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
