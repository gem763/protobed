We welcome the opportunity to engage with the RBA as part of its broad-based, periodic review of the payments industry next year,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAfterPay Touch hit the headlines again last week after the research team from UBS initiated coverage on the stock with a sell rating, forecasting that the share price would halve over the next 12 months as the company and its business model faced scrutiny from regulators here and abroad.\n\nThe company does not charge its customers interest - only late fees \u2013 and is not captured by consumer credit laws in Australia. The vast bulk of the company\u2019s revenue is earned from merchant fees or from the retailers who use the service.\n\nThe public rebuttal of UBS comes hard on the heels of several days of intense media scrutiny of the divisive company.", "description": "AfterPay Touch has dismissed claims it is a sitting duck for regulatory action saying it looks forward to contributing to a broad based review of the payments industry in 2020.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/483fbb8a2f9c96303aea7cc03908455caf6bc67f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
