On the bright side, this opens up the possibility for multiple celebrity Halloween costumes over the course of two full weekends. On the dark-sided side, Chrissy Teigen (and, sure, the rest of us goblins) is left with an observation we all have to agree with.\n\nI have never seen a longer Halloween in my life. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 27, 2019\n\nSurely we\u2019ve had a Halloween on a Thursday before? How did we handle it? Did we celebrate during the weekend before or after? How will this affect the nation\u2019s wig delivery schedules? Obviously more is more, so hopefully the celebs who have donned a costume already will re-up, while the more conservative amongst them can hang back and see whose outfit they have to beat. We warn you now: Stormi is coming in with some heat. Check out our (every-expanding) collection of celebrity Halloween costumes below.\n\nGabrielle Union-Wade and her sweet baby Kaavia channel Bring It On, significantly lowering the earth\u2019s temperature with an unseasonable amount of Clovers in the atmosphere.\n\nIn a year of J. Lo, Lisa Rinna gives you one J. Lo more.\n\nbella_baskin: It\u2019s Britney bitch pic.twitter.com/rP15lQqJ8W \u2014 Demi Lovato News (@itsJCMD) October 27, 2019\n\nOne Halloween weekend down, and Demi Lovato has already delivered two looks: Casual Marie Antoinette, and Sexy Pennywise.\n\nNina Dobrev contracts an ocean eye infection as Billie Eilish.\n\nCardi B administers life-saving medicine for whatever\u2019s wrong with your ass.\n\nJessica Biel is to early 2000s Justin Timberlake as Justin Timberlake is to a sentient microphone.\n\nMeanwhile, Halsey channels Dope Show-era Marilyn Manson\u2026\n\nAs well as \u201870s-era Cher, who definitely laid a lot of the groundwork for Manson\u2019s subsequent looks.\n\nAnd the winner so far? Why, it\u2019s baby Stormi, here dressed as mom Kylie Jenner at this year\u2019s camp-themed Met Ball. Wait, okay, is this\u2026 actually camp? No? Okay, what if Kylie dressed as her baby dressed as Kylie Jenner at the Met Ball for Halloween Week 2? We\u2019re going to figure this one out. After all, we have all week.", "description": "Halsey, Jessica Biel, Justin Timberlake, Stormi, Kylie Jenner and Demi Lovato are among the celebrities breaking out their 2019 Halloween costumes this weekend.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/27-Jessica-Biel-Justin-Timberlake.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
