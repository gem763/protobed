I\u2019ve never been an 'adult'/ grown ass woman experiencing this. I was in a committed relationship for almost all my teens and early 20s, with the exception of a few breaks, which usually in those times I was working my ass off with not much R&R, and \u2018meeting / trusting\u2019 people in my position is really tuff,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking pity me, not what I\u2019m asking for. I have a great life; I wouldn\u2019t trade for \u2018privacy,\u2019 but PLEASE don\u2019t make this awkward for me!
