(NYSE:THO) Is About To Go Ex-Dividend, And It Pays A 0.7% Yield", "language": "en", "text": "Thor Industries, Inc. (NYSE:THO) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days time. Investors can purchase shares before the 24th of October in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 8th of November.\n\nThor Industries's upcoming dividend is US$0.4 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.6 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Thor Industries stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of $58.22. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Thor Industries\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Thor Industries paid out 63% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Thor Industries generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 22% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.\n\nIt's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nNYSE:THO Historical Dividend Yield, October 19th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Thor Industries's earnings per share have dropped 5.6% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, ten years ago, Thor Industries has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average. Growing the dividend payout ratio while earnings are declining can deliver nice returns for a while, but it's always worth checking for when the company can't increase the payout ratio any more - because then the music stops.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nHas Thor Industries got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. Overall, it's not a bad combination, but we feel that there are likely more attractive dividend prospects out there.\n\nWondering what the future holds for Thor Industries?
