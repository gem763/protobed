What next?", "language": "en", "text": "Voices Editorial: DA ayisafani. What next?\n\nIn the lead-up to the DA\u2019s federal council meeting, City Press expressed concern that it could be a make-or-break one for the party.\n\nTensions had been building up steadily and, uncharacteristically for the DA, the party was riven into different blocks that were not prepared to brook any compromise.\n\nOur wish then was that whatever their differences, the country\u2019s official opposition would emerge cohesive so that it would continue to play the crucial role of keeping government in check.\n\nBut alas, the party imploded in a way that few had expected. By Wednesday, it did not have a party leader, chief whip, federal chairperson, parliamentary leader or chief executive officer.\n\nThe only person left standing was Helen Zille, who had made a spectacular comeback. But her return, supported by a small group of hardcore liberal purists, appeared more like wresting the party back from the direction that Mmusi Maimane was leading to in order to change tack.\n\nRead: Mmusi Maimane was once SA\u2019s most favoured political leader\n\nThe facts are contentious, but out there the perception is that Zille and her supporters are motivated more by a need to cater for conservative white voters whom the party has shed to the Freedom Front Plus.\n\nWhile there is nothing inherently problematic with fighting to retrieve lost votes, it appears to be happening at the expense of consolidating the black support that Maimane was intent on wooing.\n\nTo quote Joburg mayor and former DA member Herman Mashaba: \u201cI am gravely concerned that the DA I signed up to is no longer the DA that has emerged out of this weekend\u2019s federal council. I cannot reconcile myself with a group of people who believe that race is irrelevant in the discussion of inequality and poverty in South Africa in 2019.\u201d\n\nBut this implosion is now a done deal and the DA, Parliament and South Africa\u2019s democracy are all the weaker for it.\n\nThe shortsightedness of those who engineered this can only be great news for those who hate accountability and the strengthening of a strong opposition that is not just content to bark at the governing party, but is actually capable of dislodging it from power if it fails South Africans.\n\nIt remains to be seen what will now happen to those who have departed, or will depart, from the DA.\n\nIf they do form a new party, what will its identity be?\n\nWill it be just another party adding to the plethora or will it offer South Africans something genuinely new?", "description": "In the lead-up to the DA\u2019s federal council meeting, City Press expressed concern that it could be a make-or-break one for the party.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9518/b34c470b221b47b99824c911b232d4eb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
