Plans to shoot in San Jose, Colombia, changed when the city's mayor was kidnapped, for example.\n\nThe bubble of being on set sometimes made it easy to get comfortable, he said. \"You just start living in a place and you forget that there's real crime everywhere around you.\"\n\nHawco said he was standing outside his hotel one night when two men got off their motorbikes and ran toward him. He was wondering what they were doing as the hotel's security guards pulled him inside.\n\n\"I've had someone running at me with a dirtbike in the Goulds, don't get me wrong. Happened on more than one occasion,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think maybe the end result was going to be slightly different.\"\n\nWorking with famous faces\n\nThe shoot gave Hawco an opportunity to work with several actors of note, in addition to Krasinski, who is well known for his role as Jim Halpert on The Office.\n\n\"Everyone around me has been on their own HBO show or has achieved some level of international success,\" he said of the show's cast.\n\nTom Clancy's Jack Ryan stars Wendell Pierce, left, and John Krasinski. (Amazon)\n\nThat included Wendell Pierce of The Wire, which Hawco said is a favourite show of his. In addition to his being familiar with Pierce's work, it turned out Pierce was familiar with Hawco's home province thanks to his time working on Suits, which filmed in Toronto. That's how he ended up discussing Newfoundland and Labrador with Pierce.\n\n\"'Tell me about scrunchions' was his opening line,\" Hawco said.\n\nHawco isn't sure exactly when Coyote shows up in the show's second season \u2014 he knows it's early in the season but not the first episode, he said. He'll be watching along with audiences when the show premieres on the Prime Video streaming service Friday.\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "When the second season of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan premieres on Friday, Newfoundlanders and Labradorians will see a familiar face on screen.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4551229.1519577691!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/allan-hawco-caught.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
