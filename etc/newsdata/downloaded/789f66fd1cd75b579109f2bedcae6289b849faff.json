You have the option of taking one third of the benefit amount in cash with the remainder of the funds being reinvested to provide a monthly pay-out or annuity. Or you can reinvest the full benefit amount from which to draw a monthly income,\" says Botha.\n\nWhat happens when you die?\n\nWhile still alive, the RA member will be the sole beneficiary of its benefits.\n\nHowever, if you were to pass away before accessing your RA benefits, then the total fund value becomes payable as a death benefit, of which, under current legislation, the first R500 000 is tax-free with the balance of the funds taxed according to a sliding scale.\n\nIf you are already drawing a monthly sum, the availability of any value to be paid to beneficiaries will exclusively be dependent on the type of annuity or pension that was purchased.\n\nWhat about your dependents?\n\n\"According to the Income Tax Act, an RA is excluded from a person\u2019s estate at the death of the member, which is why the nomination of a beneficiary on your retirement annuity is vital,\" says Botha.\n\n\"It is very important to consider who you support financially and who relies on you for their livelihood and daily living costs when you complete your RA nomination form.\"\n\nThe trustees of a retirement annuity fund will determine how to make an equitable allocation of the money that is available. They would also consider other allocations such as the terms of a will or other assurance.\n\nMinor children could receive more than major children. Some dependants might be excluded due to the greater need of others based on the amount that is available for distribution, for example. There are numerous important aspects to consider when children, especially minor children, are involved.\n\n\"Children normally receive their allocations in cash when they reach the age of 18, unless otherwise specified by the beneficiary.\n\n\"If a minor child is allocated a benefit from an RA, the biological parent (if still alive) will receive the benefit on behalf of the minor unless the parent is found to be unfit to manage the money on behalf of the minor or where the parent instructs that the money be invested in a vehicle such as a trust or beneficiary fund,\" says Botha. \"If any other party is involved other than the parent, the money will normally be invested in a beneficiary fund and the legal guardian will receive an allowance.\"", "description": "An RA differs from other retirement products.
