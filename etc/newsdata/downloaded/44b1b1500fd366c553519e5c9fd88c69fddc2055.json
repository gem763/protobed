Turns out it pierced through a tendon (see ultrasound video).\"\n\nHe added that thanks for his doctor and his medical team, he is now \"officially urchin free and on the mend.\"\n\nThe actor noted that the \"only drawback\" is \"having to wear this massive hand elevating contraption for the foreseeable future,\" which he included a shot of in his post.\n\n\"All in all, though, I have to say: uni is still delicious,\" he joked, referencing the delicacy made from sea urchins gonads.\n\nDespite the injury, it seems Harris had a wonderful time abroad -- he shared a video of some of the fun during the vacation in August.\n\nHe doesn't seem to be letting the injury slow him down either. He recently visited Epcot at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida with family and friends.", "description": "Neil Patrick Harris is recovering after suffering a freak accident in Croatia nearly two months ago.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/nph-ht-er-191016_hpMain_v4x3_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
