The upcoming Disney action-adventure movie starring the Rock as a riverboat captain and Emily Blunt as a scientist-explorer is based on the long-established Disney park attraction of the same name. For the movie version of this brief and pleasant Disney ride, Rock plays Frank, whose rickety boat is going to take Blunt\u2019s Lily and her brother McGregor (Jack Whitehall) deep into the Amazon to find a magical healing tree. Jungle Cruise, which comes out July 24 of next year, is brought to you by The Shallows director Jaume Collet-Serra and co-stars Edgar Ramirez, Jesse Plemons, and Paul Giamatti. Looks like Scorsese wins the day on this one!\n\nRelated", "description": "The Rock, Emily Blunt, Edgar Ramirez, and Jesse Plemmons star in the trailer for Jungle Cruise, which is based on the Disneyland ride.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-jungle-cruise.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
