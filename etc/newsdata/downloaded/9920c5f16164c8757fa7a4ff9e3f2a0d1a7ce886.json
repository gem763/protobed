DOJ also argued that the lower court judge erred because he didn\u2019t evaluate whether the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office had demonstrated \u201ca specific and immediate need\u201d for Trump\u2019s records.\n\n\u201cThe court should be ordered to stay enforcement of the subpoena as to the President\u2019s personal records unless and until\u2014at a minimum\u2014the District Attorney is able to make the required showing of particularized need,\u201d DOJ wrote.\n\nThe filings from Trump and the DOJ come after Judge Victor Marrero, a federal district court judge in New York, on Monday dismissed the president\u2019s lawsuit that sought to block enforcement of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office\u2019s subpoena for his tax returns and other financial records.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office is seeking the records from Trump\u2019s accounting firm, Mazars USA, as part of a grand-jury investigation into payments made ahead of the 2016 election to women who allege that they had affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyers quickly filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The appeals court established an expedited briefing schedule in the case, with oral arguments set for Oct. 23. The court has blocked enforcement of the subpoena until arguments in the case are completed.\n\nIn his ruling Monday, Marrero, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton William (Bill) Jefferson ClintonHouse Democrats subpoena Rick Perry in impeachment inquiry House Democrat breaks from party, says House should vote to start impeachment inquiry Why impeach Trump? Follow the polls MORE, argued that the federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction over the lawsuit and that any court case on this issue belongs in state court. Alternatively, he denied Trump\u2019s motion for temporary relief in the event an appeals court ruled that abstention isn\u2019t warranted.\n\nMarrero blasted Trump\u2019s position that the subpoena is unlawful because presidents can\u2019t be criminally investigated while in office. The judge said that the Constitution did not envision such a broad assertion of presidential immunity. And he said that he is not persuaded that DOJ memos arguing that presidents can\u2019t be criminally investigated should be given the weight that Trump\u2019s lawyers ascribe to them.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argued Friday that there is no rationale for the federal courts to abstain from exercising jurisdiction over his lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThere is no basis for insisting that the President pursue a claim that the federal Constitution immunizes him from state process in state court,\u201d they wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers also argued that the president\u2019s immunity claim is \u201cmeritorious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the district court focused on various Justice Department opinions, it failed to seriously confront the settled constitutional principles that underlie those opinions,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cThere has been broad bipartisan agreement, for decades if not centuries, that a sitting President cannot be subjected to criminal process. That consensus follows from the Constitution\u2019s text, history, and structure, as well as from precedent.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argued that the court should overturn Marrero\u2019s opinion. However, if the appeals court agrees with Marrero, it should block enforcement of the subpoena until the president files a petition to the Supreme Court, Trump\u2019s lawyers added.\n\nIn a separate case, a federal appeals court in D.C. on Friday ruled against Trump in his legal challenge to block House Democrats\u2019 subpoena to Mazars. The Democratic-led House Oversight and Reform Committee\u2019s subpoena to Mazars is similar to the New York prosecutors\u2019 subpoena but did not explicitly seek Trump\u2019s tax returns.", "description": "President Trump on Friday urged a federal appeals court to reverse a lower court\u2019s decision dismissing his lawsuit\u00a0over New York prosecutors\u2019 subpoena for his tax returns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100819getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
