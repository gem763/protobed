Revisiting Independent\u2019s R900m propaganda gift", "language": "en", "text": "When sitting on the Biznews desk many fascinating emails cross our path, and every now and again we get to make them public, with permission from the author of course.\n\nEd Herbst, a former journalist, is worried the country may be on the cusp of another info scandal. Herbst\u2019s concerns lie in an article Politicsweb editor James Myburgh wrote asking how much of the R900m loan from the Public Investment Corporation to Iqbal Surve\u2019s Independent Media Group has been repaid.\n\nThe question sparked a Surve\u2019 campaign to \u201cexpose racists\u201d naming Myburgh, Biznews publisher Alec Hogg (after we republished Myburgh\u2019s piece) and former Oxford Don, author RW Johnson. That dust has now settled but the question of whether Surve is servicing his loan from public sector pensioners remains unanswered two months later. One wonders if the public will ever know? Some good insight. \u2013 Stuart Lowman\n\nBy Ed Herbst*\n\nIn 1977, as a television news reporter based in the Pretoria office of the SABC, I was sent to interview Connie Mulder. I was expecting a brooding, taciturn person but found a charismatic man whose charm filled the room. I also interviewed Eschel Rhoodie, who was far more withdrawn.\n\nA year later, while stationed in Windhoek, I was astonished by a midweek Rand Daily Mail front page lead headline \u201cIt\u2019s all true! That weekend Rapport\u2019s front page headline was a single word, \u2018Swendelary!\u2019 relating to the Afrikaans word for swindle.\n\nThe info scandal had been bust wide open at a press conference by a courageous and principled man, Judge Anton Mostert.\n\n\n\nThis was one reason why an excerpt from a new book by Alister Sparks, The Sword and the Pen, published in the Sunday Times at the weekend resonated with me.\n\n\n\nIt resonated with me at a different level because I wonder if we are not on the cusp of another Info Scandal and my concern stems from an article published by Dr James Myburgh who runs Politicsweb.\n\n\n\nThe state is, by far, the biggest employer in the country and the pensions of these civil servants \u2013 which should be sacrosanct \u2013 are controlled by the Public Investment Corporation which is duty bound to seek the maximum investment return on their monies so that they are guaranteed the best-possible quality of life in their twilight years.\n\nChronology\n\n\n\nThe following four articles provide a chronology of why I, in my subjective perception, feel we should, as a matter of justified public interest, be concerned and seek answers:\n\n\u2022 The first was published in Business Day almost two years ago and the author Stephen Mulholland, who knows a fair amount about the financial side of newspaper publishing, suggested that the predictions by Dr Iqbal Surv\u00ea about his turnaround strategy for Independent Media would not be realised.\n\n\u2022 The second was published on the Media Online website by Dirk de Vos 16 months ago. In the article de Vos suggested that R2bn had been spent by Surv\u00ea and the PIC on a company that which was not worth half of that amount and that profitability would be difficult to realise.\n\n\u2022 The third by James Myburgh and the most important was published on the Politicsweb website and re-published by Alec Hogg of Biznews. Myburgh asked how much of the R900m loan to Dr Iqbal Surv\u00ea by the PIC had been repaid in the two and a half years since the loan was granted and how much of the accrued interest. He was unable to get a cogent answer.\n\n\u2022 The fourth was a response to the Myburgh article by Sydney Kaye and he suggested that the Cape Times was being run at the behest of the ANC as a parastatal \u2013 with all that this implied.\n\n\n\nInstead of supplying an answer to Myburgh\u2019s question, Dr Surv\u00ea played the race card and threatened one of the most respected journalists in the country.\n\nA billion rand \u2018gift\u2019?\n\n\n\nAccording to chapter 16 of our Bill of Human Rights, South African citizens are entitled to information which affects them. Myburgh\u2019s question and the absence of any convincing answer seems to imply that Sekunjalo was gifted almost a billion rand to create another propaganda arm for a political party which is acknowledged \u2013 even by itself and constantly so \u2013 as pervasively corrupt.\n\nThis could potentially affect the futures of hundreds of thousands of civil servants. Furthermore, it dwarfs the amount spent on Nkandla and makes the money spent by John Vorster and Eschel Rhoodie on establishing the Citizen look like chickenfeed.\n\nWhat further disturbs me is the two year struggle by Business Day journalist Stuart Theobald to get answers, also involving the PIC, about a loan of more than a hundred million rand to a subsequently liquidated company, Alliance Mining.\n\nI also raised concerns at the time about whether the PIC had done the necessary due diligence investigation before giving Alliance Mining this money.\n\n\n\nThere might be perfectly logical reasons for these PIC loans and the PIC could well provide us with the necessary assurance to allay the unease raised by the questions of Dr Myburgh and Stuart Theobald.\n\n\n\nAll that needs happen is for Dr Daniel Matjila, Chief Executive Officer of the PIC and Dr Surv\u00e9 to answer questions in parliament.\n\n\n\nShould they not voluntarily accede, then the person with the spinal fortitude to summon them is the UDM\u2019s \u2018Mr Clean\u2019, Bantu Holomisa, who has already raised similar concerns with the Public Protector.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Ed Herbst is a pensioner and former reporter who writes \u2018in his own capacity\u2019\n\n* For more in-depth business news, visit biznews.com or simply sign up for the daily newsletter.", "description": "Is Iqbal Surve servicing his R900m loan from public sector pensioners?
