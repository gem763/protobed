Henson For Khloe Kardashian", "language": "en", "text": "Lamar Odom is still playing defense.\n\nThe troubled former NBA star told TVOne\u2019s \u201cUncensored\u201d that he dated Taraji P. Henson before future wife Khloe Kardashian, praising the \u201cEmpire\u201d star and bashing himself for the way he handled the relationship. (See the clip below.)\n\n\u201cI just wish I could have done things different with her,\u201d he said in the preview posted Tuesday. \u201cI learned a lot from her because that was the most significant relationship as a grown-up that I had with a Black woman.\u201d\n\nOdom said he carried a picture of the Oscar-nominated actor during NBA road trips. The thought of seeing her again in Los Angeles motivated him to spectacular effect during one game against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\u201cShe gave me inspiration, a Black woman working like that that\u2019s just as good at her craft as [I am at] my craft,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t last.\n\n\u201cThings ended with Taraji because of me being an immature punk,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to tell her that I was falling in love with another woman named Khloe Kardashian.\u201d\n\nThat didn\u2019t last either.\n\nOdom wrote in his book \u201cDarkness to Light,\u201d released last spring, that he cheated on Kardashian in a spiral of sex addiction. He also detailed his drug abuse.", "description": "\"Things ended with Taraji because of me being an immature punk,\" he said.", "authors": ["General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db1d266210000762934af70.png?cache=ehql7gjjrt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
