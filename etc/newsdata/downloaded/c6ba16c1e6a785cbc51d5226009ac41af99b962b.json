She has also received South African colours for chess.\n\n\n\nFellow competitor Trinity van Beeck, 12, has set up a BackaBuddy page here in the hopes of raising the R40 000 Amahle needs for the tournament which runs from December 14 to 22.\n\n\"This is an incredible opportunity and hopefully, with your help, it can be a reality,\" Amahle said in a short video.\n\nSome money is already coming in to the page titled: \"Get Amahle to African Youth Chess Tournament\", with messages of support also left for her.\n\nTrinity did the same to get Amahle to Johannesburg in March where she finished fifth in the SA Junior Chess Closed Championships.\n\nSince then, she went on to win the Western Cape Schools Chess under-11 girls division and South African Schools Chess under-13 girls tournaments.\n\nHlaluka is extremely proud of his young charge, while Trinity calls her a \"beautiful warrior spirit\".\n\nTrinity's mom, Marisa Laas, is confident Amahle will go on to become a women's candidate master at the African Youth Chess Championship.\n\nHer daughter has also qualified for the South African Junior Closed Chess Championship in 2020, and she could be the next to earn South African colours to compete internationally with her friend next year.\n\n\"These two beautiful girls inspire and push each other to be the best and as a mom I couldn't be prouder of them both. Even at their young age, they understand the importance of women supporting other women. We as adults can learn so much from them,\" said Laas in a statement from BackaBuddy.", "description": "A friend of an 11-year-old chess whizz-kid has started a fundraiser so that her friend from Crossroads in Cape Town can travel to Namibia to compete in the African Youth Chess Tournament in December.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9503/9e252a894e6b45fabe4694578f67ce54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
