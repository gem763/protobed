Movement: What to know about the extreme-savings trend", "language": "en", "text": "Would you be willing to save 75 percent of your income in order to retire by the age of 30?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of the F.I.R.E. movement, which stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early.\n\nParticipants in the movement save up huge percentages of their paychecks for several years in order to retire much earlier than the typical retirement age.\n\nThe trend has become particularly popular among millennials, who are fed up with demanding, high-stress jobs and want to devote their time to more fulfilling pursuits.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not an easy trend to follow. According to Forbes, there are essentially three steps to pursuing F.I.R.E., which include significantly cutting down on expenses and saving 75% (ideally) of your income in investments.\n\nThe third step is to retire once you\u2019ve saved 25 to 40 times your annual expenses -- depending on how old you are.\n\nTo find out more about the trend, here are five things to know about the F.I.R.E. movement:\n\n1. The movement was partially inspired by a book published in 1992\n\nEven though the F.I.R.E. movement has picked up steam in the last few years, one of the greatest inspirations for the F.I.R.E. Movement is the book \u201cYour Money or Your Life,\u201d by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez, according to Money. The book was published in 1992 and Robin, who is now in her 70s, hasn\u2019t worked since she was in her 20s, the magazine reported.\n\nHowever, Robin didn\u2019t necessarily intend for her book to have the impact that it has.\n\n\u201cOur aim was not just to have a whole bunch of people quit their jobs,\u201d Robin told The New York Times last year. \u201cOur aim was to lower consumption to save the planet. We attracted longtime simple-living people, religious people, environmentalists.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe 2010 book \u201cEarly Retirement Extreme,\u201d by Jacob Lund Fisker also greatly inspired the movement, according to Forbes. Fisker also started a blog with the same name, on which he promises to \u201cgive you the tools to become financially independent in 5 years.\u201d\n\n2. There are different levels of saving within the F.I.R.E. movement\n\nThe F.I.R.E. blog \"Physician on FIRE\" explains that there are two kinds of FIRE: leanF.I.R.E. and fatF.I.R.E.\n\nIf someone is following a leanF.I.R.E. lifestyle, they\u2019re living extremely frugally. According to the blog, that\u2019s the approach that Fisker took to retire in just 5 years.\n\nMeanwhile, someone who\u2019s following fatF.I.R.E. spends a bit more than a typical early retiree, the blog says.\n\n3. There can be some negative social impacts\n\nAlong with the difficulty in saving so much money, the F.I.R.E. movement can have a negative impact on participants\u2019 social lives, according to The New York Post.\n\nFriends and relatives can misunderstand the motivations of F.I.R.E., and significant others can struggle to conform.\n\n4. Some say F.I.R.E. is only for the wealthy\n\nOne of the bigger issues with the F.I.R.E. movement is that it isn\u2019t available to people with small incomes, according to money management expert Dave Ramsey.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\n\u201cMany proponents of F.I.R.E. agree that no matter how much you cut down your lifestyle, it\u2019s going to take a large income \u2014 probably somewhere in the six-figure range \u2014 to have the ability to save enough to retire before your 40th birthday. Keep in mind, you\u2019re trying to out-save a lot of inflation and non-working years the earlier you retire,\u201d Ramsey says on his blog.\n\n5. Even when you retire, you still have to live frugally\n\nAfter years of saving at extreme levels, young retirees still have to live frugally once they\u2019ve retired. According to The Times, many people who adhere to F.I.R.E. take out just 4% from their portfolio accounts. So if someone has saved $1 million for retirement, they should only take out about $40,000 a year, increasing it only by inflation.", "description": "Here are five things you should know about the F.I.R.E.
