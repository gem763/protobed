There are now 32 stores, some opened from scratch, others acquired from independent shopkeepers. The distribution facility has become highly sophisticated and automated. The online business is booming, both here and overseas.\n\nAngling Direct is not expected to deliver pre-tax profits until 2021\n\nInterim results, announced earlier this month, revealed double-digit growth in turnover and the company said too that over the summer like-for-like store sales rose 13.3 per cent while online sales were up nearly 27 per cent.\n\nMost retailers can only dream of this type of growth, yet Angling Direct\u2019s shares have had a terrible few months, falling from \u00a31.09 in August to close at 60p last week.\n\nMidas recommended the shares in November 2017, when the price was 78p, so investors have had a rough ride. But the company does not seem to have put a foot wrong.\n\nRather, it has been hit by widespread disaffection with small, AIM-traded stocks, worries about Britain\u2019s economic prospects and persistent bad news from the broader retail sector.\n\nSome big investors have also shied away from Angling Direct because Bailey is investing the group\u2019s cash in future growth, so the company is not expected to deliver pre-tax profits until 2021.\n\nAll these issues are very real, but Angling Direct is a fast-growing specialist business, operating in a market with exciting opportunities.\n\nAngling Direct\u2019s shares have had a terrible few months\n\nFishing is a top ten hobby among young and old, with nearly a million anglers in the UK alone, and enthusiasts spend hundreds of pounds on tackle. Angling Direct offers an extraordinarily wide range of kit, its prices online tend to be cheaper than those on Amazon, and fishing fans on the Continent are snapping up its rods and bait.\n\nLooking ahead, Bailey is keen to continue expanding across the Channel and increase the number of UK outlets to about 50 over the next few years. He also recruited a new finance director last week \u2013 Steven Crowe. He is an experienced former accountant who should bolster the management team.\n\nMidas verdict: Angling Direct shares have disappointed investors in the past two years, but it would seem rash to give up hope now. The company is growing and Bailey is ambitious and knowledgeable, having spent more than 30 years with the business. Above all, fishing is a hobby that enthusiasts tend to pursue whatever the economic climate. At 60p, the shares should rebound.", "description": "Angling Direct was floated on the stock market in July 2017, when it owned 15 stores in Kent and East Anglia, had a distribution facility in Rackheath, Norfolk, and a burgeoning online business.", "authors": ["Joanne Hart For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
