Just visit his Instagram page, @surrealhk, and see for yourself how he brings such bizarre scenarios to life.\n\nThe Hong Kong-born artist began the account two years ago, after moving back to the city from Venezuela in 2016.\n\nThe 10 best Instagram accounts for when you need to keep calm\n\nAll the photos on his account, which now has more than 48,000 followers, are cleverly altered using Adobe Photoshop. Most of them feature the Hong Kong\u2019s iconic urban landscape, allowing Fung to document what he calls his \u201csurreal life\u201d in the 852.\n\n\u201cWhen I first returned to the city, I had no idea what I could do. I wanted to keep working as a photographer, but I didn\u2019t have any connections to help me get into the industry, so I knew I had to find a way to stand out, \u201d says Fung, who is now in his 40s.\n\nAfter a year of wandering around the city, taking countless photos, inspiration struck: Fung saw a way of combining photography with comedy \u2013 with the help of Photoshop \u2013 to inject some positive energy into the stressful lives of Hongkongers.\n\n\u201cWhat I aim to do with my work is to give people a good laugh. I think Hongkongers are quite unhappy; their lives are all about work,\u201d Fung says.\n\nFung\u2019s quirky re-imaginings of the city weren\u2019t initially well-received; people dismissed his work as \u201cfake photos\u201d, without paying attention to the messages behind.\n\n\u201cPhotoshopped images seem to get a bad rap among Hong Kong people. They only cared about whether my photos were real or edited, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Fung recalls.\n\nBest cameras for students 2019: Budget-friendly options for beginners, social media content creators, vloggers and more\n\n\u201cLuckily, after some time, more people began to understand and appreciate my creative outlet.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the painstaking attention to detail that makes Fung\u2019s work look so real, the key to his success is the unique perspective he has of Hong Kong.\n\nHaving left the city when he was nine, Fung\u2019s goals since moving back has been to rediscover his much-changed hometown. It means he\u2019s able to notice things about the city that others might overlook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m intrigued by so many things in Hong Kong, such as the double-decker buses and the skyscrapers, but most people are quite used to these things already, so they don\u2019t see what I see,\u201d he says.\n\nTo bring his vivid ideas to life, Fung spends around six to eight hours editing an image. More complicated projects can take more than 30 hours to complete.\n\nWhile editing software can do a lot, Fung still believes that photo taking is the most crucial step in his work flow.\n\nThe 4 best free online programs for audio, video, and photo creation and editing\n\nTo prove his point, Fung refers to the most-like photo on his account. The image, from July 17, shows the Hong Kong government headquarters in Admiralty covered in Lennon Wall sticky notes, a symbol of the ongoing anti-government movement in Hong Kong.\n\nFung spent days scouring the city for a Lennon Wall that met his criteria \u2013 one that was not covered with plastic film, and had access to direct sunlight.\n\nHe eventually found what he was looking for in Fortress Hill, but even then, the process wasn\u2019t as simple as snapping one photo; Fung wanted every sticky note on the wall to be distinct.\n\n\u201cI took photos of almost every inch of the wall, instead of just copying and pasting one corner to cover the entire building,\u201d Fung explains. \u201cAlthough it was a really difficult project, it is my favourite piece of work so far, because it really embodies people\u2019s demands.\u201d\n\nThe Photoshop master has worked hard to turn his hobby into a career. He encourages teenagers who share the same interest to start watching online tutorials and become self-taught pros, like he did.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing for a living is obviously not a conventional job, but this is my dream, and I pursued it,\u201d Fung says. \u201cIf you have a dream, go for it, you\u2019ll never know unless you give it a try. And even if you fail, that\u2019s OK, because you won\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d", "description": "Photographer Tommy Fung uses his camera skills and Photoshop to combine real life and comedy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/35f3bc0a-efda-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires181732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
