He came to watch young artists be vulnerable on stage.'\n\nUrging others to share her story, Stuckless explained that the event's mission statement is to empower emerging artists and to 'create an open space for creatives to share what they love,' so she was alarmed when it was first brought to her attention that Weinstein was sitting in a booth.\n\nStuckless said because 'no one said anything' after the show began, she didn't think it was him. But when a comic got on stage and called out to the crowd to address 'the elephant in the room' Stuckless claims the event organizers, bartenders and others at the gathering on Manhattan's Lower East Side, 'booed her into silence' and 'compliance'.\n\n'I was sitting there, and the more that I sat there waiting for the event organizers to kick him out, or for another performer to call him out, or for the audience to revolt, the more I found myself paralyzed by the silence,' Stuckless shared on Facebook. 'He was sitting there, allowed to laugh and clap and drink and flirt and no one was saying anything. The more I sat there the more furious I was at all of our inaction.'\n\nThe woman escorted out (right) said: 'He was sitting there, allowed to laugh and clap and drink and flirt and no one was saying anything'. Weinstein appears left\n\nShe said 'bodyguards herded' her out and 'event organizers were happy to see me go'\n\nBut as she left crying other women thanked her for speaking up when they were scared\n\nThe incident was at an Actor's Hour event at Downtime Bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan Wednesday. Described as a 'underground, speakeasy', the venue greets guests with a neon sign in the form of a naked woman and text that reads: 'Go all the way down'\n\nThe event is only for writers, directors, actors, musicians and a select group of artists, according to an online description.\n\nOrganizers say there's 'endless networking, an entertaining night for spectators... Doesn't matter WHO you are' and artists don't have to audition but must send through their work on email for review.\n\nDescribed as a 'underground, speakeasy', the venue greets guests with a neon sign in the form of a naked woman and text that reads: 'Go all the way down'.\n\nStuckless said it was thinking of all of Weinstein's accusers that got her riled up enough to take action at the event where organizers said proceeds from the tickets costing $10-20 go to Suicide Prevention Center NYC.\n\n'I thought about all of the voices that have been silenced over so many years,' Stuckless continued in the social media post.\n\n'I thought about the artists, the women, who were paralyzed by the same fear that I felt, surrounded by colleagues who were intimidated into a culture of silence and passivity. This room was a microcosm of our whole community. And I couldn't sit there and let him laugh. So I spoke up.'\n\nThe incident was at an Actor's Hour event at Downtime Bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan Wednesday but the venue said they are not connected to the guest list\n\nDowntime explained why they asked the 'heckler' to leave: 'We respect the privacy of patrons and event partners, and want to ensure that all guests are treated equally, with the same service and respect'\n\nThe clip shows a woman touch Stuckless on the arm to gesture her out. Stuckless tells the stunned room that she will leave but had to get her point across.\n\nShe told followers it was an example of how despite the #MeToo movement and others that followed in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, woman and others are still trapped by the powerful of influential figures.\n\n'I was kicked out of the bar tonight,' she clarified. 'In some ways tonight was a horrible, painful reminder of the power a man like Weinstein holds even now. It was a reminder that even in this time of relative awareness it is hypnotically easy to be pulled into a culture of silence.'\n\nStuckless said the encounter did bring some positive results and those who were too scared to take a stand shared their thanks with her as she bawled outside the bar.\n\n'It was also a reminder that our voices have so much more power when we stand together,' Stuckless commented. 'When I left the building, crying out of fury and frustration I was quickly surrounded by a group of mostly women who expressed the same fear to raise their voice that I had. They thanked me for speaking up.\n\n'Our passivity is poison. We need to stand together, and we need to speak up. Or this poison will fester, only encouraged by our fear.'\n\nThe incident took place the same day actress Rose McGowan filed a lawsuit against Weinstein, his ex-attorneys and a private intelligence agency, alleging they conspired to discredit her when she accused the disgraced movie mogul of rape.\n\nOn Thursday Downtime bar said in a statement that the venue was rented out by Actor's Hour which created the guest list 'all on their own'.\n\nDowntime explained Stuckless was escorted out because she ignored instructions to quieten down.\n\n'Please know that our goal at Downtime is to create an environment where everyone feels welcome,' a statement read. 'We respect the privacy of our patrons and event partners, and want to ensure that all guests are treated equally, with the same service and respect. In keeping with this goal we made a decision that would allow the evening to continue as planned.'", "description": "Zoe Stuckless is seen confronting Harvey Weinstein for showing up at Actor's Hour in New York's Downtime bar Wednesday where he was 'allowed to laugh and clap and drink and flirt'.", "authors": ["Leah Simpson For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20149510-0-image-a-86_1571947945783.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
