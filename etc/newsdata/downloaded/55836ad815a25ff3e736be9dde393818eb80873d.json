There are fears of riots and attacks on prisons after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's death\n\nUnder lock and key: Three prisoners are seen through a hatch in a cell door at the prison in north-eastern Syria which is being guarded by Kurdish forces\n\nSecurity fears were already heightened after Turkey's invasion of northern Syria caused chaos in the region.\n\nKurdish guards were summoned away from the camps to fend off the Turkish attack and a U.S. official said as many as 100 ISIS prisoners had already escaped.\n\nHowever, Trump quickly insisted that some of the escaped prisoners had already been recaptured.\n\nThe SDF previously warned they would not be able to spare the forces to guard the al-Hol camp where families of ISIS jihadists are housed.\n\nIn his last recorded audio message, Baghdadi had urged attacks on the prisons to free ISIS fighters.\n\n'As for the worst and most important matter, the prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate. Your brothers and sisters; do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them,' Baghdadi said.\n\nWomen at the camp have turned one of their tents into a court administering the group's harsh interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nCrowded: Some of the tens of thousands of prisoners being held at ISIS camps in Syria - where security is already in question after Turkey's invasion\n\nEscort: A Kurdish fighter unlocks the door of a prison cell while another one keeps watch over an ISIS prisoner at the camp in Hasakeh two days ago\n\nThe camp is also reliant on international aid, and food is sometimes scarce and the water used for drinking and cleaning is contaminated.\n\nLast month, a 16-year-old girl was found guilty of apostasy and then stabbed repeatedly with knives.\n\nKurdish guards evacuated her to a clinic where she later died, according to the commander of a Kurdish police force.\n\nEarlier this month police stormed a tent and rescued two women who had been sentenced to die and were about to be stabbed to death.\n\nISIS supporters had fought back with knives and pistols when the Kurdish guards stormed in.\n\nPresident Trump yesterday threatened to 'drop' hundreds of ISIS fighters back in Europe if Britain, France and Germany would not take them back.\n\nTrump called his European allies a 'tremendous disappointment' in a furious attack yesterday just moments after announcing Baghdadi's death.\n\nDemanding that Britain, France and Germany deal with their ISIS fighters at home, Trump warned the U.S. would not pay for hundreds of jihadists to be held at Guantanamo Bay 'for the next 50 years'.\n\nEurope has been reluctant to allow the fighters back in but Trump warned he would 'drop them right on your border' if they are not sent back to face justice.", "description": "Kurdish guards are 'on high alert' today as they prepare for possible riots or attacks on the prison camps where thousands of ISIS supporters are being held (one of the prisons in Syria is seen above).", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/16/20287180-0-image-a-15_1572279670195.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
