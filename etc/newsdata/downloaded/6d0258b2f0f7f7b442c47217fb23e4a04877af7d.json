There are now over 6,000 stores that offer Klarna's solutions globally, and as that number grows its in-store volume should rise too. Offering consumers the same POS financing options in-store that they can access online should lead to consumers using Klarna's solutions at physical stores, and since e-commerce accounted for just 10.1% of US retail sales in Q2 2019, in-store sales provide Klarna with a much bigger volume opportunity. If it can continue to drive in-store use of its products and add more merchants, its volume and users should jump up even more.\n\nKlarna is adding 6 million users in the US annually, potentially setting it up to garner significant volume in the market. It has over 3,000 merchants in the US now and continues to add more, especially in the apparel industry, including Abercrombie & Fitch and Rue21. With millions more potential users and an increasing merchant base, Klarna may be able to rack up volume in the US since 41% of consumers in the country already report having used an installment loan, showing that there's interest in offerings like Klarna's.\n\nA looming issue for Klarna and other POS financing startups is the growing interest payments giants are showing in the space. Chase, Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and PayPal all have POS financing plays, and some of these offerings are still developing: Visa just recently announced the pilot of its solution, for example.\n\nBecause these players have established relationships and massive merchant networks, they could potentially hinder startups' ability to gain acceptance. To account for this, startups like Klarna should try to add merchants and consumers as fast as possible before more industry giants begin adding new offerings that compete directly with them: PayPal Credit just launched a new financing option that can be used for transactions of just $30, for instance.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?
