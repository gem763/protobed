REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nDevelopments since last month\u2019s meeting have taken some pressure off the BOJ, with the United States and China agreeing on a temporary pause in a trade war that has hurt global growth.\n\nThe BOJ\u2019s \u201ctankan\u201d survey showed that while manufacturers were reeling from slumping global demand, capital expenditure and service-sector mood were holding up.\n\nBut the decision will be a close call. The BOJ stands ready to act if a flare-up in trade tensions or renewed fears of a disorderly Brexit jolt markets and spark an unwelcome yen spike, say sources familiar with the central bank\u2019s thinking.\n\nA fragmented monetary policy board also complicates the debate. While some are wary of the pain additional easing could inflict on Japan\u2019s banking sector, at least three in the nine-member team see benefits in acting sooner than later to fend off risks.\n\nStill, a lack of tools left in the BOJ\u2019s toolbox and the rising cost of prolonged ultra-low interest rates mean the hurdle for topping up stimulus will be high, the sources said.\n\n\u201cGlobal risks persist but aren\u2019t imposing huge damage on domestic demand yet. Markets are also calm,\u201d said one of the sources. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many factors that justify acting now.\u201d\n\nIf the BOJ were to ease, the most likely option would be to take short-term rates deeper into negative territory, the sources said on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe BOJ may opt for more modest steps, such as tweaking a pledge on how long it will maintain ultra-low rates, if it sees that risks are not big enough to warrant full-blown easing, they said.\n\n\u201cThe BOJ still has ammunition in stock. But there aren\u2019t that many left,\u201d another source said.\n\nMORE EXPLAINING TO DO\n\nThe BOJ said last month it would use its Oct. 30-31 rate review to look more closely at whether overseas risks have heightened enough to derail the path toward hitting its 2% price target, stoking market speculation of an imminent easing.\n\nA Reuters poll conducted between Oct. 2-14 showed two thirds of economists expected the BOJ to ease this month.\n\nDespite subsiding overseas risks, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has signalled that the central bank has not let its guard down given lingering global uncertainties.\n\nA cut in the International Monetary Fund\u2019s global economic forecasts led Kuroda to concede last week that a pick-up in global growth would be delayed.\n\n\u201cOn the whole, the world economic outlook...has become less buoyant,\u201d Kuroda told Reuters, adding that he had no preset idea on when the BOJ could act.\n\nAny signal from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which meets on Oct. 29-30, on the future pace of rate cuts may also move markets and affect the BOJ\u2019s policy decision, analysts say.\n\nUnder a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and the 10-year bond yield around 0%. It also buys government bonds and risky assets.\n\nKuroda has signaled that deepening negative rates will be among key options if the BOJ were to ease. But critics warn that doing so could do more harm than good by hurting commercial banks\u2019 profits and discouraging them from boosting lending.\n\nAs a more moderate alternative, the BOJ could commit to keeping rates low for longer by tweaking its forward guidance that rates will stay at current ultra-low levels at least until around spring 2020, the sources said.\n\nBut any such move would be defined more as a fine-tuning of communication rather than an expansion of stimulus, they said.\n\nIn new quarterly forecasts due next week, the BOJ is expected to slightly cut its price estimates but roughly maintain its view that inflation will head toward 2%, the sources said.\n\nIf it opts to hold policy steady, the central bank will also use its quarterly outlook report to offer a deeper-than-usual analysis on how overseas risks could affect Japan\u2019s output gap and the path toward hitting 2% inflation, they said.\n\nJapan\u2019s economy continues to expand moderately as robust domestic demand offsets some of the pain from soft exports. But a sales tax hike that kicked off in October could cool household spending, some analysts say.", "description": "The Bank of Japan is leaning toward keeping monetary policy steady next week as stable markets, a truce in U.S.-China trade talks and robust domestic demand give it room to save its dwindling ammunition to battle the next recession, sources said.", "authors": ["Leika Kihara", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444434975&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0MW-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
