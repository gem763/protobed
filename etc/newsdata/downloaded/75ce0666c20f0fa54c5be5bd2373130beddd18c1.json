But so much credit should be reserved for gutsy Somerset hosts who had been in pole position to win the title before losing at Hampshire last week.\n\nWith Essex 102 for one after lunch and, with Alastair Cook having scored his seventh half-century of the summer in reply to Somerset's 203, the contest looked as good as over.\n\nCook had played some delightful backfoot cover drives to reach 53, but Essex collapsed after his 148-ball stay ended with a deflection off Leach to Tom Banton at short-leg.\n\nIt was the start of Essex losing nine wickets for 39 runs in 18.4 overs as Leach (five for 32) and Roelof Van Der Merwe (four for 41) rolled through the innings with seven fielders often crowding the bat.\n\nBrowne (18) had been removed by Dominic Bess before lunch when the skies were grey and the Taunton faithful were grateful for the County Ground floodlights.\n\nBut as the day brightened up, so did Somerset's belief that the impossible was possible.\n\nDan Lawrence steered his second ball from Leach to Craig Overton at gully and Ravi Bopara, like Browne earlier, was pouched at silly mid-off after pushing forward to Van Der Merwe.\n\nThere were still whispers of an early finish during the tea interval, but Somerset backed up Hurry's bold words as Essex lost their last six wickets for 15 runs.\n\nSkipper Ryan Ten Doeschate (4), Tom Westley (36) and Simon Harmer (0) fell to more catches around the bat in successive overs from Leach and Van Der Merwe.\n\nLeach then had Aron Nijjar lbw prodding forward before completing his five-wicket haul next ball by beating Sam Cook with a full-length delivery.\n\nAdam Wheater was the last man out for 12, bottom edging Van Der Merwe to wicketkeeper Steve Davies, as the decibel levels rose both and off and off the pitch.\n\nEssex had some anxious moments when they batted again, Browne and Cook were beaten several times and vain appeals went unheard.\n\nBess removed Browne for the second time, but Somerset - who gave Marcus Trescothick a farewell appearance in the field in the closing stages, with the former England batsman's 26-year stay at the county coming to an end - were destined to finish runners-up for the fifth time in 10 seasons.\n\nPA", "description": "Essex survived a nervous finale brought about by an extraordinary first-innings batting collapse to win the Specsavers County Championship with a Taunton draw against title rivals Somerset.
