He was previously indicted on charges of conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering. Brien O\u2019Connor, a lawyer for Hodge, declined to comment.\n\nHodge was CEO of Pimco, the world\u2019s largest bond manager, from 2014 to 2016.\n\nHodge is among 52 people charged with participating in a vast scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.\n\nWilliam \u201cRick\u201d Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March to charges he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and helped bribe sports coaches at universities to present his clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits.\n\nThe 35 parents charged in the investigation include executives and celebrities, such as \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star Felicity Huffman and \u201cFull House\u201d actress Lori Loughlin.\n\nHuffman reported to prison on Tuesday after she admitted to engaging in the college exam cheating scheme and was sentenced to a 14-day term. Loughlin has pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors alleged that beginning in 2012, Hodge agreed to pay Singer $200,000 to facilitate through bribery his daughter\u2019s admission to USC as a purported soccer recruit.\n\nHe later agreed to pay Singer another $325,000, beginning in 2014, to similarly facilitate his son\u2019s admission to USC as a football recruit using falsified athletic profiles.", "description": "Douglas Hodge is among 52 people, including actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, charged with participating in the scandal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8ef6f210000c21334a4b7.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
