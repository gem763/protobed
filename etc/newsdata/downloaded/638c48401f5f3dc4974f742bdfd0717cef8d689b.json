Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League) We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill\u2019s computer generated upper lip that it\u2019s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds. So bad it effectively got everyone but Gal Gadot dumped from the franchise. (AW) Warner Bros 2/34 33. Mark Pillow as Nuclear Man (Superman IV: The Quest for Peace) Presumably hired because fellow \u201cforeign, unconvincing muscle-man\u201d Dolph Lundgren wasn\u2019t available, Mark Pillow made for one of the worst DC movie villains. To be fair to him, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is a famously abysmal film, but his Nuclear Man \u2013 a villain so blandly nefarious even his name feels like it came about via 30 seconds of brainstorming \u2013 doesn\u2019t help matters. (AW) Warner Bros 3/34 32. Cara Delevingne as Enchantress/June Moone (Suicide Squad) It\u2019s not been plain sailing swapping the catwalk for the big screen for this aristocratic supermodel-turned-actor, specifically with her role in this puerile comic book film. She plays June Moone, an archeological boffin transformed into a bikini-clad witch by some haunted dust. The film got devastatingly bad reviews, despite doing well at the box office. It may well be a performance Delevingne would like to forget. (CC) Warner Bros 4/34 31. David Thewlis as Ares (Wonder Woman) The one area of Wonder Woman we don\u2019t like to talk about is its villain, as his appearance in the film\u2019s final act turns a smart and funny movie into one just like all the others \u2013 namely with two superpowered beings throwing things at each other. (AW) Warner Bros 5/34 30. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master (Aquaman) It was always going to be tricky to make much of an impression in a movie in which Amber Heard, sporting an enormous red wig, catapults her way into underwater battle riding a dolphin. Which might explain why Patrick Wilson, playing Aquaman\u2019s dastardly half-brother Orm, has fallen so rapidly out of memory. (AW) Warner Bros 6/34 29. Faye Dunaway as Selena (Supergirl) The doomed Supergirl movie is a living testament to how badly Mommie Dearest impacted the career of Faye Dunaway, with her turn as a witchy supervillain with a dangerous love spell at her disposal secretly the nadir of her Eighties career. She may nail a certain level of camp here, whether deliberate or not, but Dunaway is certainly no good \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise she was awarded a Razzie for her performance. (AW) Warner Bros 7/34 28. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor (Superman Returns) A big gulp in 2019 for obvious reasons, but also pretty regretful because it's an incredibly dull performance from an actor who was, whether we like to admit it or not, masterful at playing villains in his prime. Here, however, Spacey is just a snooze. (AW) Warner Bros 8/34 27. Yahya Abdul-Mahteen III as Black Manta (Aquaman) About as threatening as a Power Rangers villain and just as stupid-looking, Aquaman's recurring nemesis is more a perpetual irritant than someone particularly enjoyable to watch. (AW) Warner Bros 9/34 26. Liam Neeson as Ra's al Ghul (Batman Begins) Ra's al Ghul, or \"The Demon's Head\" in Arabic, jumped on the climate activism bandwagon nice and early. For him, the human race is a cancer poisoning the Earth, and he wants to eliminate people to save the world from environmental disaster. Neeson played the villain so well because he really believed in him. \u201cIt was quite a good argument he comes up with,\u201d the actor said. Terrifying. (EH) Warner Bros 10/34 25. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze (Batman & Robin) Arnold Schwarzenegger wasn't so much playing Mr Freeze in Batman & Robin as he was The Pun King, few surviving his merciless deployment of woeful gags. Schwarzenegger is by no means good here, but he's absolutely captivating nonetheless. (AW) Warner Bros 11/34 24. Sharon Stone as Laurel Hedare (Catwoman) Only one of the worst DC villains because her evil plot was to poison Gotham City via killer face cream, Laurel Hedare at least allowed Sharon Stone to be devious, slinky and cartoonish for the first time since Basic Instinct. It's a very minor victory, though. (AW) Warner Bros 12/34 23. Jared Leto as Joker (Suicide Squad) It would be easy to pity Jared Leto, who was always going to be compared to the late Heath Ledger\u2019s transcendent portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight, if it weren\u2019t for how much hype he built up before Suicide Squad was even released. There were the tattoos, his green hair, a shiny grill in his mouth, and a ludicrous number of articles about his supposed bad behaviour on set. So it was downright embarrassing when it turned out Joker wasn\u2019t even the lead villain in the movie, and instead just an annoyance who turns up to mock the lead cast every now and then. (RO) Warner Bros 13/34 22. Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate (The Dark Knight Rises) Although many will purely remember Cotillard\u2019s performance in The Dark Knight Rises for that awfully awkward death scene, she was great in the rest of the movie. She played one of Batman\u2019s most interesting female adversaries with a slyness and a deception that was mysteriously alluring and effective. (EH) Warner Bros 14/34 21. Michael Shannon as General Zod (Man of Steel) The kind of role Shannon could play in his sleep, his General Zod is more angsty and human than his live-action predecessors playing the same character, but harmed by the relentlessly dank surroundings of Zack Snyder\u2019s film. He\u2019s also saddled with the most unflattering haircut in all of DC movie history, which couldn\u2019t have helped. (AW) Warner Bros 15/34 20. Tom Hardy as Bane (The Dark Knight Rises) Warner Bros 16/34 19. Burgess Meredith as The Penguin (Batman 1966) Entirely unsubtle work from Meredith here, the actor grinding his teeth and chewing on the end of a large, thin cigarette to emphasise the Penguin\u2019s dastardly villainy. But it\u2019s a lot of fun to behold nonetheless. (AW) 20th Century Fox 17/34 18. Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor (Superman) The Oscar-winning actor was easily the most fun incarnation of Lex Luthor when he was cast in the 1978 Superman. As the hero\u2019s arch nemesis, his light-hearted and theatrical portrayal came across as more comical than menacing. But despite the fact it was hard to take him as a serious threat, he was still a compelling villain to watch. He reprised the role in Superman II and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. (CC) Warner Bros 18/34 17. Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski (Superman Returns) One of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab and rapidly forgotten Superman reboot, Parker Posey very much plays to type here. But it's such a delicious, mischievous performance, all eccentricity and barely-concealed madness, that it's not remotely a problem. (AW) Warner Bros 19/34 16. Joaquin Phoenix as Joker (Joker) The role that, for better and for worse, Phoenix was born to play, his Joker is disturbing and brilliantly oddball. But it\u2019s a performance that is also suffocating by nature of how present it is. Without any respite, in the form of a Christian Bale or a Michael Keaton, it ends up feeling a lot like Phoenix swallowing you whole, and that\u2019s not the best of experiences. (AW) Warner Bros 20/34 15. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle (The Dark Knight Rises) Catwoman \u2013 the thieving, on-again, off-again love interest of Batman \u2013 was brought to life brilliantly by Anne Hathaway who deftly encapsulated her slinky, feline energy and gave an emotionally nuanced performance which offered a fresh perspective on the character after Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s turn in the Nineties. (EH) Warner Bros 21/34 14. Lee Meriwether as Catwoman (Batman 1966) The actor, who is now 84, is unforgettable in her portrayal of Catwoman in the 1966 film. Using feline movements when she walks, she winds up with one of the best scenes in any Batman: when disguised as a Soviet reporter called Miss Kitka, complete with Sixties Beehive hair, she seduces Adam West\u2019s Caped Crusader so she can abduct him. They have a very passionate kiss, but when he figures out she is Catwoman, he is heartbroken. (CC) 20th Century Fox 22/34 13. Cesar Romero as Joker (Batman 1966) It may be an unpopular opinion, but Cesar Romero always had the best Joker laugh \u2013 a shrill, gleeful racket of purely mad joy. He\u2019s also one of the few actors to play the character without a heap of exhausting off-screen intensity, too. With his white makeup merely painted over his moustache because Romero couldn\u2019t be bothered to shave it off, there\u2019s a blissful, unique ease to his work in the original Batman movie. (AW) 20th Century Fox 23/34 12. Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy (Batman & Robin) Batman & Robin may feature a vast ensemble of stars all acting in very different films, but Uma Thurman is the only one truly in keeping with the gaudy, camp vision that director Joel Schumacher (probably?) had in mind for it. Her Poison Ivy is basically a ludicrous, plant-groping drag queen dressed occasionally in a gorilla suit, and playing up the absurdity is arguably the smartest acting choice in the whole damn film. (AW) Warner Bros 24/34 11. Jim Carrey as The Riddler (Batman Forever) Released at the peak of Carrey\u2019s Nineties fame, Batman Forever didn\u2019t cast Carrey because he would be perfect for The Riddler, but because they wanted Jim Carrey \u2013 squirming, scenery-chewing, face-contorting and all. It ends up falling somewhere between genuinely brilliant and mildly awful, but on occasion becomes actually chilling. (AW) Warner Bros 25/34 10. Frank Gorshin as The Riddler (Batman 1966) Gorshin\u2019s work on the original Sixties Batman series, and its 1966 film, has always been underappreciated. It\u2019s partly due to The Riddler himself, a character notorious in Batman\u2019s rogues gallery of villains, but always one that has struggled to be well portrayed on-screen. But Gorshin tried his best, morphing his Riddler into a sinister genius with a maniacal laugh and a fearsome, intimidating intelligence. (AW) 20th Century Fox 26/34 9. Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (Batman Forever) \u201cI will not sanction your buffoonery,\u201d Jones reportedly told his co-star Jim Carrey on the Batman Forever set. One of the most notorious examples of Jones's famed workplace grouchiness, his unhappiness working on the film at least wasn't visible on screen. He's fantastic here, all mad cackling and hysterical showboating. (AW) Warner Bros 27/34 8. Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow (Batman Begins) Cillian Murphy didn\u2019t get the screentime he needed \u2013 or deserved \u2013 to really develop what could have been one of DC\u2019s most intriguing villains: a corrupt psychopharmacologist testing his wares on the inmates at Arkham Asylum. What works is his understated manner and appearance; Scarecrow didn\u2019t need an outlandish costume because the terror he instilled was all in your head. (RO) Warner Bros 28/34 7. Christopher Walken as Max Schreck (Batman Returns) The true villain of Batman Returns, the tragic humanity of Catwoman and The Penguin entirely lacking in Schreck's capitalist, salacious and pro-gentrification business mogul. It's no surprise there have been Trump comparisons in the years since. But it's also important to not forget quite how brilliant Walken is in the role, too. (AW) Warner Bros 29/34 6. Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face (The Dark Knight) Less spoken about by nature of the stunning work by Heath Ledger elsewhere in The Dark Knight, Aaron Eckhart is also the film's secret weapon. His Harvey Dent is noble and well-intentioned and dripping with vaguely Kennedy-esque suave, which only makes his eventual transformation into Two-Face that much more tragic. (AW) Warner Bros 30/34 5. Danny DeVito as The Penguin (Batman Returns) Few villains are as memorable as Danny Devito\u2019s Penguin. The 1992 performance in Tim Burton\u2019s gothic Batman Returns is as entertaining as it is menacing, and he even instils a sense of pity with his role as a monster who just wants to be accepted \u2013 or at a pinch, feared \u2013 by the society that rejected him. (RO) Warner Bros 31/34 4. Terence Stamp as General Zod (Superman II) A villain played with delicious apathy and verve by Terence Stamp, General Zod is far and away the finest nemesis Christopher Reeve\u2019s Superman ever had to face off against. Ruthless, menacing and dressed like the coolest cat on the Studio 54 dancefloor, he\u2019s a blast. (AW) Warner Bros 32/34 3. Jack Nicholson as The Joker (Batman) The only thing lacking from Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker is an element of surprise. Even in 1989, there was something admittedly tried-and-tested about Nicholson playing insanity with such ripe conviction on screen. But regardless, his work here is terrifying \u2013 not quite Jack Torrance levels, but equally as captivating. It\u2019s no wonder he got top billing over the guy who actually played Batman. (AW) Warner Bros 33/34 2. Heath Ledger as The Joker (The Dark Knight) The best of the best: Heath Ledger transformed himself completely and made the role his own opposite Christian Bale\u2019s Batman in The Dark Knight. His performance was so outstanding that he has become the gold standard to which all other actors aspire when they take on a villainous role. It\u2019s hard to believe there will ever be a better Joker. (RO) Warner Bros 34/34 1. Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman (Batman Returns) The mystery over Catwoman's moral allegiances has been alive almost as long as she has in comic book lore, but it also makes her the most captivating sort-of nemesis in all of the DC movies. Michelle Pfeiffer is a sensual, terrifying and incredibly funny presence throughout Batman Returns, her irresistible allure making her the most threatening individual Batman has ever faced off against. She also gives one of the greatest performances not only in comic book movies but in all movies entirely, to whom all her successors, Catwoman or not, can't help but pail in comparison. (AW) Warner Bros 1/34 34. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf (Justice League) We were so distracted by the bad jokes and Henry Cavill\u2019s computer generated upper lip that it\u2019s easy to forget that the Justice League faced off against a horned CGI muscle man voiced by Ciaran Hinds.

She is scheduled to star in Hulu\u2019s forthcoming take on High Fidelity.\n\nProduction for The Batman is reportedly scheduled for later this year, with a released date confirmed for summer 2021.", "description": "Zoe Kravitz has been cast as Catwoman opposite Robert Pattinson\u2018s Bruce Wayne\u00a0in\u00a0The Batman.", "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/30/09/zoe-kravitz-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
