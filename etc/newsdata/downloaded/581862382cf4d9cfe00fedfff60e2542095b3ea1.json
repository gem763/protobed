I know Eben is playing this week.\n\nWhen asked whether Etzebeth's situation had been a distraction to the squad, Kolisi replied: \"No, not from what I'm seeing. We've just been preparing for the game.\n\n\"Every game for us is now a playoff game because if we slip up we're out of the competition.\"\n\nKick-off on Friday is at 11:45 (SA time).", "description": "SA Rugby president Mark Alexander says no authority has suggested that the Springboks send Eben Etzebeth home from the Rugby World Cup.", "authors": ["Lloyd Burnard -"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8949/75456ea815bf4e26aeeca38352d651cc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
