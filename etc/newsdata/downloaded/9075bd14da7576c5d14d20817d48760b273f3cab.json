It's a race against time to forge a deal that can be approved at a summit of European Union leaders this Thursday and Friday.\n\nBritish PM Boris Johnson and Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn attend the Queen's speech. Getty\n\nMr Johnson has made further concessions, and is being asked to make still more, as his plan draws ever closer to the failed deal put forward by Theresa May.\n\nThis means that even if the EU approves it - and even that might possibly be only in-principle - getting it through the British parliament at a special sitting on Saturday will be a mammoth task.\n\nBrexiteer Conservative MPs have been making encouraging noises in recent days. The latest good tidings for Mr Johnson came from backbencher Lee Rowley, who consistently voted against Theresa May's deal.\n\n\"In the last few days, there has at least been hope that this toxic and crippling fog we have created might just be lifting, as the Prime Minister sketches out an outline of a way forward,\" he told parliament as opening speaker in the Queen's speech debate.\n\n\"If there is light at the end of the tunnel later this week ... we have a fundamental responsibility in this place to try to resolve this most vexed of problems, and allow our despairing and embittered country to move on.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there is still the prospect that the opposition parties and pro-EU Tory rebels could potentially force Mr Johnson to agree to a referendum (or \"confirmatory ballot\") on his deal, rather than giving him the election he wants.\n\nAnd there is growing expectation that the deal may not be struck until a special EU summit that would be called right before the October 31 deadline.\n\nIn that case, Mr Johnson may be forced to delay Brexit until January 31, as required by a law MPs passed last month against his wishes, which requires him to ask the EU for a three-month postponement if he hasn't landed a deal by October 19.\n\nPseudo manifesto\n\nMr Johnson is well short of a parliamentary majority, so there is no way he can pass any of the 26 bills in the Queen's speech until there has been an election. So the document serves mostly as a manifesto for that election, which could be as soon as late November.\n\nOn immigration, Mr Johnson promised a law to end freedom of movement for EU citizens while guaranteeing the status of those already here.\n\nThis would \"pave the way\" for a new immigration system focused on skilled migrants - often referred to in the British media as \"an Australian-style points-based system\".\n\nIn another nod to Australia, the government also proposed to toughen its regime for screening foreign investments on security grounds. It said this would make Britain's laws \"consistent with many of our major partners and allies around the world, including countries such as Australia\".\n\nThe Queen's speech promised to make jail sentences tougher and deal with foreign-national offenders, while also reforming prisons, boosting rehabilitation and increasing victim support. There will also be a new regime for drone use that interferes with civil aviation.\n\nThe country's struggling railway system would be overhauled, with the franchise system redesigned to ensure more transparent ticketing and trains that run on time.\n\nChancellor Sajid Javid announced before the Queen's speech that he'll bring down a budget on November 6 - almost immediately after Brexit, assuming it happens on Halloween as scheduled.", "description": "Law and order, immigration and infrastructure feature in the Queen's speech, but the focus is still on that bid to land a Brexit deal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3308%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_399%2C$y_142/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/691344e00879042b09b6ebe8ed700d88d7820fc4", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
