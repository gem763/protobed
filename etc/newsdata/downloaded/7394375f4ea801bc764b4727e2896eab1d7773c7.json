Ripken accepted Ramos\u2019s admission after a hearing Monday afternoon. She scheduled the start of jury selection for Wednesday in the next phase of the case, in which Ramos\u2019s attorneys will argue that he is not criminally responsible for the shooting and should be committed to a mental hospital instead of prison.\n\nIn Maryland, a defendant is entitled to an insanity acquittal if he proves that at the time of the offense, as a result of a mental disorder, he lacked \u201csubstantial capacity to appreciate\u201d the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\n\nIf Ramos succeeded in that defense, he would be confined to a psychiatric institution for treatment and eventually would be eligible for release if it was decided that he was not likely to pose a danger to the public in the future.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe attack killed the Capital Gazette\u2019s editorial page editor, Gerald Fisch\u00adman, 61; assistant editor Rob Hiaasen, 59; sportswriter, reporter and editor John McNamara, 56; sales assistant Rebecca Smith, 34; and reporter Wendi Winters, 65. Six other employees in the office were not shot and escaped after the attack.\n\nIn court Monday, as survivors of the shooting and loved ones of the dead looked on, Ramos appeared before the judge, clad in green jail clothing, with a flowing beard and his hair tied in a ponytail. He listened for an hour as State\u2019s Attorney Anne Colt Leitess recounted previously undisclosed details of the attack.\n\nDriving a rented Kia Rio, Ramos traveled from his home in Laurel, Md., to Annapolis, arriving at the newspaper shortly after 2:30 p.m. with a duffel bag containing smoke grenades, a shotgun, more than 50 rounds of ammunition and devices to barricade doors, Leitess said. She said he is seen on security video checking the gun\u2019s flashlight and laser sight before trying to enter the office but encountering a locked door.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe opened fire, shattering the glass door.\n\n\u201cNo! No! No! No!\u201d a witness heard Smith yelling, Leitess said.\n\nReporters in the office ran for cover, hiding under desks while Winters grabbed a recycling bin and trash can to fend off the shooter. \u201cYou stop that!\u201d she yelled at Ramos, according to Leitess, who was quoting a witness.\n\nAfter the massacre, Leitess said, Ramos dialed 911 and told the call-taker: \u201cThis is your shooter. The shooting is over. I surrender.\u201d\n\nIn Ramos\u2019s apartment, investigators later found a greeting card and a CD that contained photos of Capital Gazette employees and surveillance video of the office, prosecutors said. Some of the names were labeled \u201cHigh Value Targets,\u201d Leitess said.\n\nAD\n\nIf Ramos had not admitted committing the crimes outlined in the 23-count indictment, Leitess said, survivors would have testified that they had to step over the bodies of slain co-workers as they evacuated the building after police arrived.\n\nAD\n\nAs officers searched the building, she said, Ramos was hiding beneath a desk. When they found him, he had discarded the safety glasses and orange earplugs he wore during the shooting. \u201cI surrender, I surrender,\u201d he said, according to Leitess. \u201cI\u2019m your shooter.\u201d\n\nIn the pistol grip of his shotgun, Leitess said, police found a note with a quote from a book called \u201cActive Shooter: Events and Response.\u201d It said: \u201cThere are very few problems in the world that cannot be solved by clear and concise communication. The remaining problems can be solved with the proper placement and application of high explosives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRamos\u2019s admission that he carried out the attack spares the prosecution from having to prove to a jury that he was the shooter. With that first phase of the trial now unnecessary, the second phase will focus on his mental state at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAs Leitess on Monday described the rampage, survivors and relatives of the slain sat silently in the courtroom gallery, dabbing tears and rubbing one another\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how I feel at a time like this,\u201d Andrea Chamblee, McNamara\u2019s wife of 33 years, said after the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s a whipsaw of emotions, but there\u2019s no name for it. I can\u2019t really compare it to any other feelings I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEach new development in the case has brought a painful reminder: She has a Google alert set for her dead husband\u2019s name. Every time an alert appears in her email, she said, \u201cmy stomach lurches. But I read them anyway.\u201d\n\nAndy Jezic, a Maryland criminal defense lawyer and former Anne Arundel County prosecutor, said he was not surprised that Ramos acknowledged being the gunman.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like there is overwhelming evidence that he is the killer, so there would be very little reason to have the jury hear all the horrific details about him shooting everybody. But I still think they have a right to a jury trial on the insanity or not-criminally-responsible stage,\u201d said Jezic, who is not involved in the case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrials involving the insanity defense are exceedingly rare nationwide, and the success rate for defendants in those cases is minuscule. Usually when lawyers invoke the defense, they have valid reasons for doing so, and prosecutors typically end up conceding that the defendants aren\u2019t legally guilty.\n\nBut because of the gruesome nature of the rampage and because Ramos\u2019s mental state at the time of the shootings is unclear, Jezic said, it makes sense for prosecutors to leave the determination to a jury.\n\n\u201cWhen something is so heinous as this, the prosecutor needs the jury to make the final judgment,\u201d Jezic said, noting that a jury decided that John W. Hinckley Jr. was not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan and three others outside a Washington hotel.\n\nAD\n\nHad Ramos gone to trial on whether he committed the offense, jurors could have been shown a video depicting the attack, under a ruling the judge made earlier after the defense team sought to block the footage from being shown.\n\nAD\n\nCapital Gazette editor Rick Hutzell said Monday after the hearing that \u201cyou simply cannot silence a free press, which is what this guy wanted to do. We wrote about him fairly and accurately. He didn\u2019t like it. When legal means were exhausted, he resorted to violence. Justice is for the living. There is no justice for the dead. Nothing that guy says will change that.\u201d\n\nStaff members at the newspaper said they had been preparing themselves emotionally for the trial for the past year, but Lietess\u2019s description of the crime was still agonizing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhausting,\u201d said Danielle Ohl, a reporter who was on vacation when the shooting occurred. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of emotion.\u201d\n\nListening to Ramos\u2019s 911 call was especially jarring. \u201cI\u2019d never heard him speak before,\u201d Ohl said. \u201cYou think someone like that \u2014 someone who would do something like that \u2014 would be a monster. But he sounded like a normal guy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said, \u201cIt almost makes it scarier because people who do this, they seem normal.\u201d", "description": "A jury will decide whether Ramos is not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice", "Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "Paul Duggan", "Crime Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ttQPJW7p_a9qPkowEGGxyFVIc7Q=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GT3NFPT66MI6RMHP776KX37ZIY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
