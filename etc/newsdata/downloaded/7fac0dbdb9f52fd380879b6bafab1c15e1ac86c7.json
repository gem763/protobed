It\u2019s being republished today as Tekashi 6ix9ine testifies against his former associates in court. Photo: Adam Tarana\n\n\u201cSorry, I forgot,\u201d Yaksha tells me, in the Bratislava headquarters of his indie rap label FCK THEM. Behind us hangs a portrait of a samurai, rendered in neon, with a passing resemblance to Mikhail Gorbachev. \u201cIn Slovakia, when some guests come, we invite them on a shot. You want a shot?\u201d\n\nI say yes and stemmed bubble glasses appear, as does a clear bottle of Slivovica. Traditional plum liquor. This particular batch was fermented at home, by the Slovak rap star Dalyb\u2019s father. It\u2019s bracing stuff. Okay, it\u2019s disgusting. But they seem to know that. They just want me to feel at home. \u201cWelcome!\u201d they shout as I drink. \u201cCiao!\u201d\n\nYaksha, 33, is, effectively, Bratislava\u2019s Sean \u201cPuffy\u201d Combs. He\u2019s also the person who discovered the now-imprisoned Brooklyn rapper 6ix9ine, when 6ix9ine was still a mostly anonymous teenager posting on YouTube. Born and raised as Daniel Hernandez in Bushwick, Brooklyn, 6ix9ine became a streaming superstar in late 2017 on the back of a public persona carefully cultivated to, above all, engender reaction. Armed with shouty street rap and rainbow-colored hair and a Jigsaw Jesus piece, he was a trollish cartoon villain.\n\nIt feels like 6ix9ine was dreamt up by an overheated viral hive mind. And it\u2019s true he\u2019d never exist without the internet. But it didn\u2019t happen the way we think. In reality, on its way to making him huge, the internet first had to bring 6ix9ine to Bratislava.\n\nOne of 6ix9ine\u2019s earliest tracks was a guest appearance on Dalyb\u2019s group Haha Crew\u2019s \u201cRolling Stones.\u201d \u201cSlovakia!\u201d he shouts on the track. \u201cWhat\u2019s good! We out here!\u201d The first time he left New York was to come here. His first-ever live show was at the Bratislava club Babylon.\n\nWilliam Asher, who co-directed a string of lo-fi provocatory music videos that shot 6ix9ine to viral infamy, says of FCK THEM, \u201cWe would put all our YouTube videos on their page and build a core fan base over there; then we toured over there. They really introduced [6ix9ine] to what it is to be, like, a rapper and shit. Before that, we weren\u2019t doing shit.\u201d\n\nHe fell in love with it here. He said, \u2018Here\u2019s fresh air! This is not Bushwick!\u2019\n\nThat a small outfit in Bratislava had a hand in launching 6ix9ine\u2019s career is a strange story about how the internet functions. It\u2019s also a muted kind of tragedy. Yaksha and the FCK THEM crew describe a polite, humble \u201cgenius\u201d they knew as Danny, who charged their plucky little scene with international relevance. Now, they watch as 6ix9ine negotiates not only federal charges but also serious accusations of extreme violence toward Sara Molina, the mother of his young daughter. And they are unable to square that reality with their own.\n\n\u201cHe fell in love with it here,\u201d Adam, Yaksha\u2019s right-hand man and semi-translator, tells me. The first time they picked him up from the airport, 6ix9ine insisted they stop on the side of the road so he could take photos of a sprawling field of yellow spring flowers. \u201cHe said, \u2018Here\u2019s fresh air! This is not Bushwick!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he started to make really big money, our plan was to invest it in an apartment in Bratislava,\u201d Yaksha adds. \u201cIt would be his European base. We must wait. But I believe this plan still will be.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Aukay_35mm.\n\nYaksha \u2014 real name, Michal Novotn\u00fd \u2014 was born to a Vietnamese father and a Slovak mother in Martin, a small town on the north of the country then known as Czechoslovakia. He grew up skating with kids who loved NOFX. \u201c\u2018Hey, bro, you must listen to punk-rock music,\u201d they told him. \u201cI said, \u2018Fuck off! Wu-Tang is way better!\u2019\u201d\n\nHis first foray into the industry was as a DJ in a rap crew, Dramatikz, who put out two albums via Sony Music\u2019s Slovakia department. Eventually, he realized he didn\u2019t actually want to be a performer. He went on to manage regionally famous names, but soon grew bored of their fealty to East Coast \u201990s rap. \u201cEvery big artist here, it\u2019s some classic shit,\u201d he says. \u201cYou must be from the street and everything is hard.\u201d Yaksha had a personal revelation: \u201cI like more New Wave rap, yeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Wave\u201d is his term for what Americans might call SoundCloud rap. \u201cIn U.S., it\u2019s [accepted] when artists have the gold grills and face tattoos and make all songs with two words.\u201d He laughs. \u201cFor everyone in Slovak and Czech Republic, to [hear] New Wave here?\u201d It was unimaginable.\n\nThen Yaksha discovered Haha Crew, a goofy trio from Ko\u0161ice. In 2013, while they were still in high school, they dropped their first single, \u201cRap & M\u00f3da,\u201d a nice chunk of luxury-brand nonsense. \u201cIt was really controversial in Slovakia. A lot of people hated them. One group coming in with a song about Givenchy?\u201d Yaksha considers it the origin point for modern Slovak rap music. He feels that everyone now owes a debt to Haha Crew \u2014 that nothing has been the same since.\n\n\u201cI heard it and I said, \u2018Oh fuck.\u2019\u201d Pause. \u201c\u2018Finally.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith Haha Crew as his marquee act, he started building what would become FCK THEM. For a few years he made no money, funding the operation through marketing and streetwear side hustles. In 2016, he started flying to New York and connecting with \u201cyoung rappers who make New Wave\u201d; he became known as the man to find if you want to play Eastern Europe. He\u2019s since put on shows for a number of fledgling rappers, including A$AP Nast, Black Dave, and Ken Rebel. Touching down in Bratislava, artists would be hesitant at first. Invariably, he\u2019d hear references to a certain torture-porn classic set in the Slovak capital. \u201cWhen I brought Nast from the airport, we cruising in the city, he told me, \u2018This is not so scary like the movie Hostel!\u2019\u201d Yaksha cracks up. \u201cI said, \u2018Bro, it\u2019s a fucking movie! This is not from reality!\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd to the delight of the artists, the gigs themselves would often have the raw energy of your old-school hard-core matinee shows. \u201cIn the U.S., it\u2019s people chilling with phones. In Slovakia, people make really big mosh pits. Whole show, everybody fighting!\u201d\n\nPhoto: Aukay_35mm.\n\n6ix9ine found his way to Bratislava via YouTube analytics. In 2014, checking the numbers on one of his early videos, he noticed a big portion of the views (then just in the few thousands) had come from Slovakia. The reason: Dalyb had posted it on his Facebook page. As Yaksha remembers it, 6ix9ine then got on Instagram and wrote something to the effect of, \u201c\u2018Do you know some Slovakian rappers I can make music with?\u2019 And a lot of people wrote him, \u2018You must make music only with Haha Crew.\u2019\u201d The resulting track, \u201cRolling Stones,\u201d was cooked up with FCK THEM via email and dropped on Haha Crew\u2019s debut, Vlna, which became a touchstone for the local scene.\n\nFor a couple of years after \u201cRolling Stones,\u201d FCK THEM and 6ix9ine retreated back into their own worlds. Then in 2016, on a long trip to New York, Yaksha met 6ix9ine for the first time. \u201cHe [DM\u2019d] me every day about meeting,\u201d Yaksha says. He took the L train to Bushwick, where 6ix9ine met him at the subway steps and took him out for fried chicken.\n\nRight away, 6ix9ine told him, \u2018Hey, bro \u2014 I will be the biggest artist from New York.\u2019\n\nRight away, 6ix9ine told him, \u201cHey, bro \u2014 I will be the biggest artist from New York.\u201d Yaksha had been skeptical of 6ix9ine and his clamoring. And at the time, he also had way more Instagram followers than 6ix9ine. But in person, Yaksha was impressed by the sheer audacity. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay! I trust you!\u2019\u201d They concocted an off-kilter marketing plan and named it From Europe Back to America: They would make 6ix9ine famous in Eastern Europe, help him pull in money doing shows there, and then use that to get big in the U.S. Because of a drug charge, 6ix9ine needed permission from a parole officer to travel. Yaksha wrote a letter requesting special exemption, and it did the trick. 6ix9ine did an appearance with the Russian rapper Pharaoh in Prague, followed by his debut gig in Bratislava. He bounced around Slovakia from there.\n\nIn Bratislava, the FCK THEM crew opened up 6ix9ine\u2019s palate with pho (he\u2019d never had it before) and fresh produce. \u201cThere\u2019s a legendary video on the internet,\u201d Yaksha tells me, pulling out his phone to show me a clip of 6ix9ine eating sliced fruit and saying, \u2018Every time I come back home, Yaksha makes me eat healthy.\u2019\u201d Yaksha does this a lot as we talk, nostalgically showing me old photos of the two of them hanging in Slovakian countryside cottages, or telling me anecdotes, like that one time he talked 6ix9ine out of getting a face tattoo of his own face.\n\nAbout a year after he started breaking big in Eastern Europe with FCK THEM, 6ix9ine found his Stateside success. In late 2017, the pop-leaning \u201cPoles1469\u201d blew up, as did the screamy \u201cGummo\u201d; both debuted on FCK THEM\u2019s YouTube page. (The videos are now, respectively, at over 100 million and over 300 million views.) From Barcelona to Paris to Kiev, FCK THEM continued to put on shows for 6ix9ine. On one of his trips to Bratislava after \u201cGummo\u201d had broken out, Yaksha and Adam remember, 6ix9ine packed nothing but what he said was a million dollars of jewelry in his daughter\u2019s princess-adorned backpack.\n\nAdam: \u201cHe didn\u2019t have socks! He didn\u2019t have underwear!\u201d\n\nYaksha: \u201cHe come to my apartment and ask me, do you have some boxers I can wear?\u201d\n\nAdam: \u201cThat night we went to the mall, just shopping for underwear.\u201d\n\nThe crew remembers 6ix9ine FaceTiming his daughter three or four times a day. They insist he was \u201ca really good father,\u201d but maybe \u201cnot a good partner.\u201d Of his 2015 charge for \u201cuse of a child in a sexual performance,\u201d for an explicit video shot with a 13-year-old girl, Yaksha says, \u201cI ask him about it, and he told me, \u2018I don\u2019t have sex with this girl; we just shoot a video with her in a bra.\u2019 And I understood it was normal.\u201d Repeatedly, they offer similarly unconvincing defenses, describing him as altogether different in private: respectful, low-key, polite. \u201cWe know him as the guy sitting quietly, eating fruit,\u201d Adam says.\n\nPhoto: Adam Tarana\n\nIn January of this year, 6ix9ine pleaded guilty to a variety of charges stemming from his affiliation with the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, including conspiracy to commit murder, drug trafficking, and racketeering. He\u2019s currently in an undisclosed federal prison awaiting sentencing. His former manager, Kifano \u201cShotti\u201d Jordan, was allegedly the link between 6ix9ine and the gang, and has also since pleaded guilty to gun charges stemming from the group\u2019s larger racketeering arrest. \u201cI didn\u2019t like this guy from day one, yeah?\u201d Yaksha says now. \u201cI told all crew around 6ix9ine, I don\u2019t believe this guy Shotti.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to believe those charges,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a whole different guy. I don\u2019t know if something changed in the U.S.\u201d Partially, it feels like they\u2019re willfully ignoring the facts, or pining for some alternate-reality version of events. If only they\u2019d managed to keep him in Bratislava, away from negative influence \u2026\n\n\u201cWhen he started making money and posting pictures with big money I told him, \u2018Hey, bro, maybe keep calm,\u2019\u201d Yaksha says. \u201c\u2018People like you like humble artist and genius. You changed into classic rapper.\u2019 I was thinking that the people around him came with the fame. They will be for a few weeks, a few months, and they\u2019ll go away. Here in Europe, it was visible it had a good influence on him. He was acting differently. In a good way.\u201d\n\nHe liked the attention of the people selling heroin, shooting people. He trolled his way into jail.\n\nThe last time Yaksha and 6ix9ine saw each other was at a show in Vienna in the fall of 2018, just before 6ix9ine was arrested. Afterward, Yaksha says, \u201ca lot of people were writing me [on Instagram] saying I should have taken more care of him, I should have taken him back to Europe. His big mistake \u2014 he liked the attention of the gang. He liked the attention of the people selling heroin, shooting people. He trolled his way into the jail.\u201d\n\nThere is reason to believe that 6ix9ine did stumble into a pose as an affiliated gang member in order to boost his persona. That\u2019s the position his lawyers have taken, arguing in court that 6ix9ine is \u201can entertainer who portrays a \u2018gangster image\u2019 to promote his music.\u201d Legally, though, it doesn\u2019t matter much if 6ix9ine was playacting. Meanwhile, the allegations of abuse are much harder to explain away. Sara Molina, the mother of 6ix9ine\u2019s daughter, recently told the Daily Beast that 6ix9ine was violent throughout their seven-year relationship, regularly leaving her bloodied and bruised. (Ed. Note: 6ix9ine has since confessed to years of domestic violence, spanning from 2011 to 2018, in cooperation with the federal government. Per that agreement, allegations of domestic abuse cannot be brought up during his subsequent testimony at trial.)\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s really difficult to talk about the private relationship of two people,\u201d Yaksha says of the abuse allegations, but \u201cmy experience with Danny and Sara has never suggested that this could be true.\u201d\n\nWhat if you knew an artist had committed domestic abuse? I ask. Would you continue working with them?\n\nYaksha doesn\u2019t directly answer the question. \u201cI am convinced that the accusations that are being carried on him are not exactly as they are referred to,\u201d he says. \u201cI also understand that he \u2026 must reckon with the consequences. Of course I agree with this, and it\u2019s the right thing. But then again, so far, Danny hasn\u2019t been found guilty for any crime for which I would have to end our friendship.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Aukay_35mm.\n\nAfter a while, we leave the FCK THEM HQ for the FCK THEM studio. We take Yaksha\u2019s Audi up to a ritzy neighborhood overlooking the city below. We pass a decadent mid-construction mansion allegedly owned by Robert Fico, the disgraced former Slovak prime minister, and pull up in front of a home a Bond villain would love. It\u2019s the former Korean embassy. Seeing me take it all in \u2014 the floor-to-ceiling glass walls; the monstrous tripartite spiral staircase \u2014 FCK THEM artist Gleb, a tall, endearingly goofy dude in a pink beanie and a skull-adorned tracksuit top, deadpans, \u201cThis was all very modern in the \u201980s.\u201d\n\nGleb is full of good lines. As the crew smokes thin cigarettes on a balcony overlooking a statue of a Red Army soldier smashing a swastika, Gleb shares his tips for spotting the ticket checkers on the Bratislava bus lines. \u201cThey don\u2019t wear a uniform but they\u2019re always the same: fat, with a stupid face.\u201d\n\nWe pop into the studio, an unadorned side room with a bathtub full of unused soundproofing foam. Gleb, fueled on nothing but energy drinks and Horalky wafers, shouts, \u201cBPM up!\u201d\n\nGleb is one of FCK THEM\u2019s biggest local stars. But while they cultivate their local talent, they also have eyes elsewhere. Fueled in part by their affiliation with 6ix9ine, the FCK THEM YouTube page now has over 1.3 million subscribers. Yaksha\u2019s current high-priority focus is the New York rapper Snubbs. But Yaksha has even bigger international aspirations for FCK THEM. He wants to use it to build FCK THEM U.K. and FCK THEM ASIA. All day long, he says, he gets emails from artists hoping to get promoted on the YouTube page. Flipping through his in-box, he shows me a sampling: \u201cThis is the first albino female to rap.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Aukay_35mm.\n\nFCK THEM\u2019s current big project is a documentary feature on 6ix9ine. They have tons of footage from years bouncing around Europe together, and interest from a few new streaming platforms. \u201cI want to show people 6ix9ine like artist,\u201d Yaksha says, \u201cand how we know him \u2014 the humble guy. And we want to show the genius part about him. But it should not be romantic, like, he\u2019s the good hero. We don\u2019t want to make a story that nobody believes. Everything should be true, in the good way we experienced it.\u201d\n\nThe last time Yaksha spoke to 6ix9ine was in New York, a few months ago. He was in a studio with Dalyb and a big group of friends, and someone rang up 6ix9ine\u2019s cell. Yaksha laughs. \u201cOkay, he\u2019s really rich, so he\u2019s in jail but he has a phone.\u201d It was a bunch of people all screaming at once, Yaksha says, so he couldn\u2019t really have an actual conversation with his old friend. 6ix9ine seemed okay, though, he recalls.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing good,\u201d Yaksha says. \u201cNobody know what actually is happening. We are waiting. Everybody waiting.\u201d", "description": "The untold story of how the underground Slovak rap label FCK THEM discovered Tekashi 6ix9ine, then watched him troll his way into jail.", "authors": ["Amos Barshad"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/04/15/15-yaksha-tekashi-2b.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
