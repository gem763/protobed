NParks\n\nIf you see a tree\u2019s fallen fruit on the ground while walking around Singapore, don\u2019t pick it up.\n\nDoing so could land you a S$5,000 fine \u2013 or worse, a S$50,000 fine and/or six months\u2019 jail, if you\u2019re in a nature reserve or national park.\n\nThe unusual law under the Parks and Trees Act was brought up again on Monday (Oct 7) by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong while responding to questions posed by MP Darryl David.\n\n\u201cMembers of the public who wish to pluck fruit from trees, or collect fruit that has dropped from trees on state land, should approach NParks for permission,\u201d the minister said, adding that the fruits \u2013 like the trees \u2013 belong to the state.\n\nA similar law also penalises people for plucking leaves and removing plants from public areas.\n\nLast year, an offender was fined S$3,000 for taking two critically endangered Singapore Kopsia saplings from a park, The Straits Times (ST) reported.\n\nIn 2011, NParks said the fruits on state trees were eaten by native animals like the Asian glossy starling, ST said.\n\nThere was also a chance people could damage the trees if they tried to remove fruit using methods like throwing rocks or poking them with bamboo poles. This could tear the bark and expose it to viruses, ST quoted NParks as saying.\n\nFruits that grow on trees in Singapore include mango, papaya, durian, custard apple, mangosteen, rose apple, hairless rambutan, island lychee, and tamarind.\n\nSome of them are first cultivated at the Pasir Panjang nursery before being planted around the country, ST added.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - It's illegal - even if the fruit's already dropped to the ground..
