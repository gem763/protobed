We have come here because we are fed up with so much repression that we have suffered from the state.\"\n\n\"We have always defended non-violence,\" said another. \"What is happening in Barcelona is not a reflection of us, we separatists are not violent, we want our country, we want to be free.\"\n\nThe day had begun with a gathering of mayors from across Catalonia to endorse the campaign for self-determination.\n\nMayors of 814 out of the region's 947 local authorities gathered at the regional government's headquarters to meet Catalan President Quim Torra.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Catalonia independence protesters: \"We feel like we are all being tried\"\n\nAs the mayors chanted \"independence\", Mr Torra said Catalans must unite to oppose \"repression\" and \"force the Spanish state to talk\".\n\nLater on Saturday, a pro-independence group that favours direct action organised a protest outside the police headquarters in the city. Demonstrators threw balls, bottles and stones at riot police.\n\nRiot police later moved to disperse the crowds, armed with shields and batons and backed by riot vans.\n\nProjectiles were fired during the clashes and at least six people were hospitalised with injuries, according to Reuters news agency.\n\nOn Sunday, politicians from Spain's two main centre-right parties, the Popular Party and Ciudadanos, are expected to attend the unionist rally, which comes two weeks before the Spanish general election.\n\nMeanwhile, supporters of the far-right Vox party rallied in the Spanish capital Madrid on Saturday to hear calls for a harder line on the separatists.\n\nParty leader Santiago Abascal attacked Spain's mainstream parties, including the ruling Socialists, telling the crowd: \"Faced with criminal separatism, there is only Vox!\"\n\nHow bad were the clashes earlier this month?\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Bel, student, 20: \"We are living demonstrations\"\n\nRioters threw paving stones and petrol bombs while police fired baton rounds and used truncheons.\n\nCars and other property were damaged as fires were lit in the streets of Barcelona and other towns.\n\nBetween 14 and 20 October, 593 people, including 226 police officers, received treatment for injuries as a result of the protests, according to regional emergency services.\n\nThe Spanish authorities later updated the number of officers injured to 289.\n\nWhy is there a crisis in Catalonia?\n\nSuccessive Spanish governments have refused to grant separatists in Catalonia a referendum on independence, which became a live issue again after the global financial crisis of 2008.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Catalan Minister Alfred Bosch: \"We\u2019re not haters\"\n\nSpurred on by the results of an unrecognised plebiscite in November 2014, separatists held an illegal referendum in October 2017, which Spain tried to prevent by force, eventually jailing the separatist leaders.\n\nWhile the separatists regularly attract massive shows of public support, they have only a slim majority in the regional parliament and a recent survey suggests Catalonia's residents oppose independence by about 48% to 44%.\n\nCatalonia has its own language and distinctive traditions, and a population nearly as big as Switzerland's (7.5 million). It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, making up 16% of the national population and accounting for almost 19% of Spanish GDP.\n\nThe EU has treated the crisis as an internal matter for Spain, deaf to the separatists' pleas for support, but there have been warnings that the issue is damaging Spain's democratic credentials.", "description": "Marchers rally peacefully in Spain's Catalonia region to protest against the jailing of separatists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07s5lng.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
