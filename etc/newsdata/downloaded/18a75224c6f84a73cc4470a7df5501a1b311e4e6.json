I thought maybe it was normal.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I became sexually active with my then-boyfriend that I began to worry as it was impossible and very painful.\u201d\n\nRead more: Sho Madjozi in a new partnership to make conversations about periods easier\n\nMolly-Rose was misdiagnosed four times and says multiple doctors failed to spot the 2cm thick wall of tissue running vertically down her vagina known as the longitudinal septum \u2013 this caused her to have two vaginas.\n\n\u201cI noticed there was a piece of skin in the middle with two holes and I felt so embarrassed. From the outside you\u2019d never know. Even the doctors didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cBefore my diagnosis, I was advised to get tested for a sexually transmitted disease due to bleeding and abnormal discharge.\n\n\u201cIt came back all clear, as predicted. But I knew something was wrong and began to research for myself which was a challenge itself.\u201d\n\nThe babysitter says there was a lack of knowledge and awareness in the medical practice and she had to tirelessly research online before discovering she has uterus didelphys.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any leaflets for me to read or doctors who could help me understand my condition which is why it took so long for me to get a diagnosis.\n\nAfter five long years, Molly-Rose\u2019s thorough research has paid off as she discovered her condition.\n\n\u201cI told my GP I know what it is and was referred to a gynaecologist for an intrusive vaginal scan.\u201d\n\nRead more: What the colour of your period is telling you about your health\n\nMolly-Rose requested to have general anaesthetic during the procedure which took place at the University College London Hospital.\n\n\u201cWithin ten minutes, they confirmed I have two uteruses, two cervixes and two vaginas \u2013 I felt so happy to finally know what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nIn August 2017 Molly-Rose had an operation for the septum to be removed. She says it would do more harm than good for doctors to attempt to remove any of her doubled reproductive organs.\n\n\u201cAlthough I may face complications when I\u2019m ready to start a family as there\u2019s a high chance of miscarrying \u2013 at least I can now plan ahead as I\u2019m aware. I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I get there,\u201d Molly-Rose said.\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t persistent, then I\u2019d still be clueless but I tend not to dwell on my condition.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sharing my story to raise awareness for other girls and women who may be going through the same.\u201d\n\nSource: Magazine Features\n\n(Pictures: CATERS NEWS/MAGAZINEFEATURES.CO.ZA)", "description": "\"When I first started my periods doctors would blame my age and say my body is still young and can\u2019t cope.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9490/341fb37a3d9e49f9bcf09a5e14a5084a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
