It Could Cost Him.", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump, right, walks on the tarmac with the U.S. ambassador to European Union Gordon Sondland, left, during his arrival on Air Force One at Melsbroek Air Base, Tuesday, July 10, 2018, in Brussels, Belgium. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 To foreign policy experts, it is no mystery why President Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser tried in May to block Gordon Sondland from becoming a player in U.S. diplomacy with Ukraine.\n\nAs the U.S. envoy to the European Union, Sondland managed a portfolio unrelated to Ukrainian issues. And beyond that, he was so inexperienced as a diplomat \u2014 a wealthy Republican donor rewarded with an ambassadorship \u2014 that one top White House foreign policy adviser complained he was a national security risk.\n\nBut Sondland wedged his way into Ukraine policymaking anyway, attending the new president\u2019s inauguration in Kyiv in May and briefing Trump afterward, all over the objections of the national security adviser at the time, John Bolton. And now Sondland\u2019s gambit appears to have placed him at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn testimony scheduled for Thursday, Sondland was expected to say that during a meeting in May, Trump gave him and two other officials the impression that they should coordinate on Ukraine issues with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. That command effectively created a foreign policy back channel that cut the State Department and National Security Council out of deliberations involving a pivotal ally against Russia.\n\nSondland was also expected to testify that he realized by midsummer that Trump had a condition for agreeing to an Oval Office meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the new president of Ukraine: an announcement by Ukrainian prosecutors that could benefit Trump\u2019s political fortunes.\n\nInitially hopeful that Sondland\u2019s account would help Trump, congressional Republicans now fear it will add momentum to Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. His decision to testify is itself a sign of fissures in the support for Trump, evidence that even some defenders have balked at shouldering the legal and reputational costs of thwarting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Sondland has evolved from a neophyte diplomat known for his ambition and subservience to the president into a witness, however unwilling, in a proceeding against Trump.\n\nIn the process, Sondland\u2019s own reputation took a hit. Fiona Hill, former senior director for European and Russian affairs at the White House, described him to congressional investigators this week as a well-meaning but inexperienced liability.\n\nHe used his personal cellphone for official business and assured foreign officials they were welcome at the White House whenever they liked, she testified. On one occasion, she said, Romanian officials showed up at the White House gates with no appointment, citing Sondland.\n\nExperts said his story was an object lesson in the pitfalls of handing influential foreign posts to diplomatic na\u00effs, while stripping oversight from career officials at the State Department and National Security Council.\n\n\u201cI told the Europeans, maybe this is the best you can expect\u201d from the Trump administration, said Daniel Fried, a former longtime diplomat now with the Atlantic Council. No one imagined, he said, that Sondland would become a pivotal player \u201cin this bottomless pit\u201d of scandal.\n\nSondland, 62, tall and bald, is far from a typical diplomat. Foul-mouthed and unafraid to bruise egos, he craves the limelight, not policy papers and the politics of quiet persuasion that are the staples of diplomacy.\n\nHe nonetheless fits a certain mold of ambassadors: The founder of a boutique hotel chain, he landed his post after decades of work bankrolling Republican presidential candidates, including John McCain, Mitt Romney and George W. Bush and his brother Jeb Bush. In Bush family circles, he was particularly well liked.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many people who do it as well as he does,\u201d David Nierenberg, an investment manager in Washington state who worked on Romney\u2019s campaigns, said of Sondland\u2019s fundraising prowess. \u201cHe knew how to deliver.\u201d\n\nFriends said he loved the trappings of politics: ferrying presidential candidates around the northwest in his Learjet and hosting their events at his 8,300-square-foot estate in Portland, Oregon.\n\nHe had hoped to be rewarded, he told Nierenberg, with an ambassadorship in a German-speaking country. That would bring his life full circle, he explained: His parents fled Nazi Germany as teenagers in 1939.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- To foreign policy experts, it is no mystery why President Donald Trump's national security adviser tried in May to block Gordon Sondland from becoming a player in U.S. diplomacy with Ukraine.As the U.S. envoy to the European Union, Sondland managed a portfolio unrelated to Ukrainian", "authors": ["Sharon Lafraniere", "Michael Crowley", "Michael S.
