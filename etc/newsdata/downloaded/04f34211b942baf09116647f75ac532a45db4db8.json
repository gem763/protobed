Even into the weekend, congressional business continued with a senior State Department official\u2019s testimony in front of House investigators on Saturday. The week in its entirety captured just how high tensions around the investigations are.\n\nExactly 100 days out from the Iowa caucuses, Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the current figurehead for Democrats \u2014 arrived in Des Moines, Iowa, to a quiet fall morning to address Polk County Democrats, most of who were hoping to get some insight from the Speaker of the House on the impeachment inquiry. Here, in a state that Trump won in the 2016 general election, Pelosi\u2019s message on Saturday was about approaching the impeachment inquiry in a way that can result in some \u201chealing\u201d for a divided country.\n\n\u201cNobody comes to Congress to impeach a President,\u201d Pelosi told the audience, an argument she\u2019s been making since Democrats announced the impeachment inquiry at the end of September. \u201cNobody comes for that, but we do take an oath to protect and defend the constitution, and when that is under threat, we cannot ignore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so as we move forward with this, we want to do it in the most solemn, prayerful way that has a healing effect on our country, and to do so in a way that we are worthy of the oath of office that we take,\u201d Pelosi said to applause.\n\nBut signs of how divisive the inquiry can be were omnipresent. Inside the event, there were T-shirts with Pelosi\u2019s image on them, and chocolates with her wearing her iconic orange coat. Outside of the Drake University auditorium and across the street, protesters held letters spelling out Trump\u2019s name and signs saying \u201cimpeach Schiff\u201d (the chair of the House Intelligence Committee) and accusing Pelosi of putting \u201cAmerica last\u201d and \u201cillegals first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think part of it was that she wanted to talk about impeachment from her own words. We have presidential contests obviously happening \u2026 and I think she wanted to get the record straight from her own mouth, which I think is helpful,\u201d Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democrats, told TIME. \u201cThe other \u2026 reason she was here was, the Democratic party nationally sees the best way to take back the U.S. Senate and keep the House in the Midwest.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s visit, announced in early October, is her first to the state with the first-in-the-nation caucuses since the impeachment inquiry began. The recent high-profile visitors have been presidential candidates flooding the state, which Pelosi acknowledged by thanking Iowans for their hospitality. But the impeachment inquiry has managed to put even a major presidential election on the backburner.\n\n\u201c[Impeachment is] kind of what\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind, and I\u2019m curious about that just like everybody else is,\u201d Elijah Marburg, a Drake University political science student who attended what he could of the Pelosi program in his marching band uniform before he had to leave to perform at a game, said.\n\nAnd though polls show there\u2019s growing favorability among the electorate for the impeachment inquiry, some Democrats have concerns about it and believe it will inevitably tinge the election. They worry Republicans could use it as a rallying cry.\n\n\u201cI feel like obviously this is such a heated election already, and especially because it is so close to the election season, the timing scares me a little bit,\u201d said Lenin Cardwell, another Drake student.\n\nIn conversations with TIME, several Democrats also said that while they think Republicans may be able to use the impeachment inquiry to their advantage, Democrats may also be energized by it as well.\n\n\u201cI approve of [the impeachment inquiry], but I am concerned about the final outcome,\u201d said Judi Cunconan, 72, a Des Moines resident who attended the event and said she\u2019s appreciated Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to rush into impeachment. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about the division it will cause in the country. We\u2019re so divided now, and all of this will just further that division.\u201d\n\nBut, Cunconan added, she was reassured with Pelosi\u2019s comments on Saturday.", "description": "\u201cNobody comes to Congress to impeach a President\u201d", "authors": ["Lissandra Villa", "Des Moines"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TZcZuy3K3byUL_DTGYbE4w--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/c388e446c38a910f6a752f73839de1c0", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
