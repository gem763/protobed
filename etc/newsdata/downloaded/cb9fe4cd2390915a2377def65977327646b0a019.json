(City of Ottawa)\n\n'They have a vise grip around Orl\u00e9ans'\n\nBlais said the NCC is telling the city they don't want to talk about the best option for relieving east-end gridlock that could stymie growth.\n\n\"They basically told Orl\u00e9ans residents that you're going to be stuck with what you've got,\" Blais told CBC News.\n\n\"The NCC plays a major role, and has for a long time, in keeping Orl\u00e9ans down. They have a vise grip around Orl\u00e9ans because of where the Greenbelt is.\"\n\nDudas said the NCC does not appear to understand the importance of the project and she wants them to come see the area for themselves.\n\n\"Option 7 is the only option,\" Dudas said. \"It's completely frustrating that the NCC is not seeing that at this point.\"\n\nThe National Capital Commission says it can't support the preferred extension of Brian Coburn Boulevard, in part because it could compromise the ecologically sensitive Mer Bleue Bog, seen here in 2016. (Trevor Pritchard/CBC)\n\nBog at risk, NCC says\n\nThe commission's objection will hamper efforts to connect people to the newly-built $2.1 billion Confederation LRT line, Dudas said, and the $4.6-billion Phase 2 expansion.\n\n\"We will continue to see more and more congestion on our existing roads. It will mean that we can't provide the long-term transit options that will allow people to see transit as a viable option,\" Dudas said.\n\n\"We're growing at leaps and bounds and we just can't accommodate that growth with our current infrastructure.\"\n\nThe NCC said the proposed alignment would risk compromising the Mer Bleue wetland, home to federally-protected species at risk, and it needs to conform to federal laws because it runs through NCC land.\n\nThe NCC said it will continue to work with city staff to find a solution.", "description": "Ottawa's east-end councillors say they're frustrated with the National Capital Commission after\u00a0it withdrew support for a boulevard extension that would have eased local traffic and connected more residents to light rail.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292479.1569023697!/fileImage/httpImage/image.gif_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/east-end-councillors.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
