You\u2019re under a microscope more than ever before.\u2019 \u2014Michael Nilsen, spokesman for Association of Fundraising Professionals\n\nThe #MeToo movement, today\u2019s charged political climate, and the growing public scrutiny of America\u2019s very wealthy means institutions must vet their donors more carefully than ever. \u201cIt\u2019s not just how much money you get, but who you get it from and the values that expresses,\u201d said Michael Nilsen, vice president of marketing, communications and public policy at the Association of Fundraising Professionals.\n\n\u201cEvery gift is a value extension of the donor and by extension, if the organization receives money from that person, that organization expresses those values,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019re under a microscope more than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe MIT Media Lab\u2019s director resigned last week after reports that lab officials tried to conceal Epstein\u2019s role in $7.5 million in donations, sometimes by listing them as \u201canonymous\u201d or by keeping Epstein\u2019s name out of correspondence about the gifts. (Some of the money was donated directly by Epstein; some of it was solicited by him, The New Yorker reported.)\n\nJeffrey Epstein\u2019s contributions to prestigious institutions are now widely seen as attempts to maintain a veneer of respectability as he battled sexual-abuse allegations.\n\nEpstein died by suicide last month in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The disgraced financier was an active philanthropist, donating $6.5 million to Harvard University and millions more to many other nonprofits, both before and after he pleaded guilty in 2007 to soliciting under-age girls and registered as a sex offender. (Harvard has said previously that it spent Epstein\u2019s money years ago and did not intend to return it.)\n\nHis contributions to prestigious institutions are now widely seen as attempts to maintain a veneer of respectability as he battled sexual-abuse allegations. He pleaded not guilty to the latest charges before his death.\n\nMIT has hired lawyers to investigate who knew about Epstein\u2019s donations, and will also perform an internal review of the school\u2019s gift acceptance policies, the school\u2019s president said in a letter to the MIT community.\n\nEvery nonprofit should ask these questions\n\nOrganizations should ask themselves four key questions about donations they\u2019re offered, Buchanan said: Would we be embarrassed to have this support? Are we being used for an objective that\u2019s counter to our values? Is an oil company trying to donate to an eco-conscious charity to distract the public from the environmental damage it does?\n\nDoes the donor expect the nonprofit to provide some benefit, such as a seat on its board of directors, in return for the donation?\n\nAnother consideration: Does the donor expect the nonprofit to provide some benefit, such as a seat on its board of directors, in return for the donation? And finally, What would our key constituents \u2014 in MIT\u2019s case, that would have been faculty, alumni, staff \u2014 say if they knew about this donation?\n\nAt MIT, some staff referred internally to Epstein as \u201cVoldemort, or he who must not be named,\u201d the New Yorker reported. The school also sometimes listed Epstein\u2019s donations as \u201canonymous\u201d in their records, according to The New Yorker. The impulse to conceal is an obvious red flag, Buchanan said. \u201cIf your instinct is, this shouldn\u2019t be public, then that means it\u2019s probably not the right thing to do,\u201d he said. (MIT did not comment for this story beyond the president\u2019s letter.)\n\nManaging the potential for \u2018reputational damage\u2019\n\nMIT\u2019s Epstein controversy is a pointed reminder to universities and other nonprofits to revisit their gift acceptance policies \u2014 and if they don\u2019t have one, write it now, fundraising experts said.\n\nSchools frequently have a written gift acceptance policy, and some \u2014 like this one at the University of Southern California for example \u2014 prohibit taking donations that \u201ccould damage the school\u2019s reputation.\u201d MIT put Epstein on a \u201cdisqualified\u201d donor list, the New Yorker reported, which indicates that the school had protocols in place for questionable donations. (MIT\u2019s former development director has said he followed school rules when accepting Epstein\u2019s money.)\n\nUniversities often use teams of detective-like experts called \u2018prospect researchers\u2019 to do due diligence on potential donors.\n\nUniversities often use teams of detective-like experts called \u201cprospect researchers\u201d to do due diligence on potential donors. These researchers try to figure out what donors may be interested in supporting with their money, and investigate a donor\u2019s capacity to give.\n\nFinding out that a potential donor just sold a $30 million home, for example, would indicate they might be primed to make a major contribution. Prospect researchers also ferret out any possible red flags. A school of public health may not want to accept money from someone who sits on the board of a tobacco company, for example.\n\nSome institutions even have policies that allow a donor\u2019s name (either a living or deceased one) to be removed from a building if the donor is \u201cinvolved in activities that conflict with the community values or that bring dishonor or embarrassment to the community,\u201d Nilsen said.\n\nA debate that goes back to the Rockefellers and before\n\nAccepting money from questionable sources has been a long-simmering tension in philanthropy. During the Gilded Age, churches were split on whether to take money from oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, said Ben Soskis, research associate in the Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy at the Urban Institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank.\n\n\u2018If the devil himself should give me $1 million to use in the Lord\u2019s business, I\u2019d take it and use it.\u2019 \u2014A Sioux City pastor quoted in a 1905 newspaper article about oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller\u2019s contributions to churches\n\nSome gladly took the funding because they saw a distinction between the source of the money and the good they would do with it. \u201cIf the devil himself should give me $1 million to use in the Lord\u2019s business, I\u2019d take it and use it,\u201d one Sioux City pastor said in a 1905 newspaper story about the controversy, Soskis told MarketWatch. But others rejected the contributions because they felt accepting Rockefeller\u2019s money amounted to an endorsement of his monopolistic business practices.\n\nWhen the question of whether to accept money relates to a donor\u2019s criminal behavior \u2014 in Epstein\u2019s case, sexual abuse of young women \u2014 answers tend to come easier. But lines can get blurry fast when nonprofits start examining how wealthy donors made their fortunes.\n\nSee also: Jeff Bezos\u2019 $2 billion charity pledge isn\u2019t necessarily great news for America\n\n\u201cSomeone like Epstein is a figure who is pretty extreme in his misdeeds, but the sector has started to ask this question about figures who are perhaps less egregious but still have questions around them,\u201d Soskis said.\n\n\u2018What about the corporate foundation that\u2019s connected to the for-profit prison company? Would we accept their funding?\u2019 \u2014Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and author of \u2019Giving Done Right.\u2019\n\nFor example, environmental organizations are reconsidering the message it sends if they accept gifts from donors whose wealth comes from the oil or mining industries. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gray space between someone convicted of a crime and business practices which are arguably detrimental to the planet, but nonprofits are increasingly having to confront that decision,\u201d Soskis said.\n\nBuchanan, of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, said his organization will soon stage a staff debate on who they wouldn\u2019t be willing to accept money from. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me we wouldn\u2019t take support from, or take as a client, a funder pursuing a white nationalist agenda \u2014 that\u2019s easy,\u201d Buchanan said.\n\n\u201cBut what about the corporate foundation that\u2019s connected to the for-profit prison company? Would we accept their funding, would we not?\u201d he added. \u201cThese are questions that every nonprofit should be asking.\u201d\n\nA sensitive time for philanthropy\n\nThe Epstein controversy comes amid a bubbling debate about philanthropy\u2019s role in society: Is it an unalloyed public good, or a tax-deductible strategy for bolstering wealthy donors\u2019 reputations? As income inequality has increased, fewer middle-class households are donating to charities.\n\nThe debate mirrors a broader question about whether accumulating vast wealth is a feature or a bug of our society.\n\nBut overall giving hasn\u2019t declined, because wealthy mega-donors are giving more than ever, according to data from Giving USA. Those donors wield immense power to pursue their own agendas while remaining accountable to no one, and critics have lined up to question that system. The debate mirrors a broader question about whether accumulating vast wealth is a feature or a bug of our society.\n\nJay Frost, a fundraising consultant who works with large institutions, says nonprofits should think more than ever about which donors are \u201caligned with their values\u201d and reject those who aren\u2019t. But he worries the Epstein controversy unfairly tarnishes philanthropy as a whole at a time when there is a need for resources to address the world\u2019s most pressing issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really afraid that this gives an impression that this is endemic, which it\u2019s not,\u201d Frost said. \u201cTo say money itself is the problem is to not recognize that there is need everywhere. In the absence of philanthropy, those needs won\u2019t be addressed.\u201d", "description": "Universities and other nonprofits have long wrestled with the ethics of certain donations \u2014 and answers don\u2019t come easy.", "authors": ["Leslie Albrecht", "Personal Finance Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR541_epstei_ZG_20190918120114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
