Sept 12, 2019. - Getty Images Europe\n\nThe artist that created the gold lavatory stolen from Blenheim Palace has said he hopes the theft was \"inspired by Robin Hood\" and denies it was a Banksy-style prank.\n\nSpeaking for the first time since the burglary, Maurizio Cattelan said the artwork \u201cwas the one percent for the 99 percent, and I hope it still is. I want to be positive and think the robbery is a kind of Robin Hood-inspired action.\u201d\n\nHis first thought had been that the news was another great art world prank, similar to when street artist Banksy shredded a \u00a31 million painting that had just been sold at auction.\n\n\u201cAt first, when they woke me up with the news I thought it was a prank: Who\u2019s so stupid to steal a toilet?\u201d Mr Cattelan told the New York Times.\n\n\u201cI had forgotten for a second that it was made out of gold.\u201d\n\nThe comments came as the Chief Executive of Blenheim Palace, the Oxfordshire birthplace of Winston Churchill, has said he fears the 18-karat gold lavatory, titled \u2018America\u2019 may have been melted down by thieves.\n\nDominic Hare said the value of the raw materials would have made the artwork attractive to criminals and hopes the notoriety of the case would \u201cimmortalise\u201d the artist because of the \u201cmoronic act\u201d he told the Telegraph.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the raw materials in this case are a higher proportion of the finished artwork than if you took a large painting and disassembled or destroyed it.\"\n\nPolice confirmed a 66-year old man held in connection with the burglary remains in custody in the West Mercia area.\n\nMr Hare did not think the arrested man was an employee of Blenheim Palace and had no idea how police had connected him to the lavatory.\n\n\u201cOur imagination runs wild, but they are still holding him so they must be convinced there\u2019s a clear connection.\u201d\n\nHe said any ticket holders for the exhibition, that runs to October 26, would be reimbursed for the three-minute time slot visitors had been able to book in the fully functioning lavatory.\n\n\u201cThey could fully perform on it if they wished, but most people couldn\u2019t time it that way so they just took selfies,\u201d he said.", "description": "The artist that created\u00a0the gold lavatory stolen from Blenheim Palace has said he hopes the theft was \"inspired by Robin Hood\" and denies it was a Banksy-style prank.", "authors": ["Dominic Nicholls"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EabBEMNBUkn2j.PNhldMbA--~B/aD0xNTYyO3c9MjQ5OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/849829777de21b46ade4de1ce8495d84", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
