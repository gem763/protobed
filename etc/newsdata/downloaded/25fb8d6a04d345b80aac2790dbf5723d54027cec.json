I want to see everybody jumping up in the locker room, being happy. Against especially teams that we're better than. Obviously, if you watched the game, we're better than them. We gave them the game. We can't do that in the NFL. They're still NFL players. They're solid. But I believe we're a better team.\u201d\n\nTampa Bay outgained Tennessee by a margin of 389-246 and earned 23 first downs to the Titans' 16. The Bucs converted seven of 15 third-down tries (46.7%) compared to the five of 13 conversions (38.4%) by the Titans. But Tampa Bay couldn\u2019t execute big plays when it mattered most. An officiating mishap, however, didn\u2019t help.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, Buccaneers linebacker Devin White stopped Titans punter Brett Kern on a fake goal, and safety Andrew Adams appeared to have a clear path to the end zone on a fumble recovery, but the play was ruled down by contact. Broadcast replays showed that the ball was out prior to the ball carrier hitting the ground, but the whistle negated any possibility for permitting the return.\n\nThe Buccaneers have now lost three in a row and are 1-4 in their last five. They\u2019re in third place in the NFC South, just ahead of the 1-7 Atlanta Falcons.\n\nOne of the biggest issues facing Tampa Bay is turnovers. The team committed four Sunday against the Titans, including two interceptions from quarterback Jameis Winston. Though interceptions have plagued Winston in his career, his head coach was quick to point out that the blame for the picks shouldn\u2019t fall on his passer.\n\n\u201cJameis didn't throw one damn interception that was his fault,\u201d Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said. \u201cHis receivers let him down today. Guys stopped on routes that were supposed to be going down the middle. The last play, the guy\u2019s supposed to go down the middle. It should\u2019ve been a big play. He played his tail off. You can write what you want. Not one of those interceptions was his fault, and it's a damn shame.\u201d\n\nEvans was one of the lone bright spots for the Buccaneers' offense, catching 11 of 12 targets for 198 yards and two touchdowns. Winston finished with 301 passing yards and two scores.\n\nThe Buccaneers now travel to Seattle in Week 9 to face the 6-2 Seahawks.\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "Frustrations are boiling over for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who couldn't hold onto a lead Sunday against the Tennessee Titans.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Reyes", "Published P.M.
