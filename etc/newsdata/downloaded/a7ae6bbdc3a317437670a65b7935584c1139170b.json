Traders are now holding nervous fingers above their buy and sell buttons as they await the outcome. Below are some key technical pressure points to consider.\n\nNaturally, Cable is expected to surge if the Houses of Parliament finally succeed in passing legislation for a Brexit deal. On the other hand, the pound is anticipated to plunge if the country fails again to decide on what's become arguably the U.K.'s most divisive issue since World War II.\n\nThe following technical analysis seeks to recognize the likely pressure points worthy of consideration as levels of supply and demand. When they hold, they suggest strength and when they fail, they increase the chances of a further decline.\n\nGBP chart\n\nThe pound finally broke through its downtrend line since mid-April 2018. However, its long-term downtrend since the 2008 crash looms large, though far above current levels, at 1.3800. While the currency crossed above the 200 DMA in the current rally, it paused below the 100 and the 200 weekly moving averages, above the 1.3000 psychological round number.\n\nAll these technical gauges of various periods and trends suggest considerable conflicting interest \u2014 the recipe for extreme volatility \u2014 reflecting the geopolitical context. However, at times, especially extreme ones, the technicals take on a life of their own, as human nature overshadows cold logic. That phenomenon is magnified when the so-called fundamentals are shrouded by uncertainty, such as that caused by the Brexit saga.\n\nThe RSI has been curving down at the top of its rising channel since July, increasing the potential for a pullback, but still within an uptrend. And that\u2019s the key.\n\nThe 1.27 level is the crosspoint of the top of the short-term rising channel, the 200 DMA and the downtrend line since April. If the pound finds support at this technical juncture it may suggest investors are accumulating positions for another rally, even if the current vote ends up with another failure for Boris Johnson.\n\nOn the other hand, if the Brexit bill does pass, paving the way for an orderly exit from the European Union, traders would do well to be mindful of the 1.35 level \u2014 another pressure point, where lies the 2019 peak below the long term downtrend line since the 2008 crash.\n\nTrading Strategies \u2013 Long Position Setup\n\nSince it will be a while before the pound gets to the 1.35 levels, should there be a positive Brexit outcome, we will here only address another Brexit fail and the probable resulting drop in the pound.\n\nConservative traders may consider a long position after the currency closes above the 2019 high.\n\nModerate traders would enter a position if the pair falls toward the 1.2800 pressure point and rallies again, to close above the 1.3000 level.\n\nAggressive traders may risk a long position upon consolidation above the pressure point below.\n\nTrade Sample\n\nEntry: 1.27\n\nStop-Loss: 1.26\n\nRisk: 100 pips\n\nTarget: 1.3\n\nReward: 300 pips", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: GBP/USD.
