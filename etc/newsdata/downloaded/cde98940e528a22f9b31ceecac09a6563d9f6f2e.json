If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nHolidays are for giving gifts that people won\u2019t necessarily splurge on for themselves but that they\u2019ll cherish if given to them. It\u2019s a time to spring for the extra-special hairbrush that\u2019ll make an everyday chore more luxurious, or for a beauty subscription box that encourages experimentation with new makeup and skincare products. No matter who is on your list, we have something they\u2019ll love. These are the best beauty gifts of 2019, according to Reviewed.\n\n1. For the one who loves a fresh blowout: Our top-rated hair dryers\n\nBest gifts for beauty 2019: Bio Ionic GrapheneMX and Revlon 1875W Infrared Hair Dryer (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nThe thrill of a smooth, sleek, speedy blowout cannot be underestimated. Our favorite hairdryer is worth the investment. The Bio Ionic GrapheneMX Professional Dryer takes wet hair to out-the-door-ready in minutes with its ultra-powerful airflow and three heat settings. If you\u2019re looking to spend (a lot) less, we also love the Revlon 1875 Infrared Hair Dryer\u2014it\u2019s lightweight, easy to use, and gives a poof-less, fast blow-dry.\n\n2. For the one who wants shiny, tangle-free locks: A hairbrush upgrade\n\nBest gifts for beauty 2019: Beauty by Earth Boar Bristle Hair Brush (Photo: Beauty by Earth)\n\nMany of us grab any old hair brush at the drugstore and don\u2019t think much of it. But this one from Beauty by Earth takes quality up a few notches and even rivals the cult-favorite brush from Mason Pearson at a fraction of the price. This brush claims to condition the hair by distributing its natural oils using boar and nylon bristles. Your gift recipient is sure to thank you for their new hair-saver.\n\nGet the Beauty by Earth Boar Bristle Hair Brush on Amazon for $17.99\n\n3.

Applying makeup or face-shaving is a whole lot easier with proper lighting and a good mirror. From our testing, our favorite DeWeisn Tri-Fold Mirror has super-bright, adjustable lighting, a clear reflection, and three magnification options. No more applying makeup\u2014or nicking the skin\u2014in the dark!\n\nGet the DeWeisn Tri-Fold Mirror on Amazon for $23.98\n\n4.

A foot bath is a spa-like experience that anyone can enjoy on their tired feet. After testing, our favorite is the Ivation Foot Spa Massager, which features adjustable heating, massage rollers, water jets, and a timer. We promise, after your giftee tries it once, it will not be relegated to the back of the closet.\n\nGet the Ivation Foot Spa Massager on Amazon for $79.99\n\n8.
