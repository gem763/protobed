There's also a high possibility of frost on Wednesday as temperatures fall as low as seven degrees Celsius.Meanwhile, a tropical storm has formed off the east coast of Guam.That's Typhoon Hagibis, and as of 10 a.m. Monday it was 550 kilometers east-northeast of Guam and will travel northwest towards waters southeast of Okinawa, Japan by the end of the week.The typhoon is forecast to intensify in the Western Pacific Ocean with a huge amount of vapor provided from the warm ocean water.Then it might grow into a super typhoon later in the week, which experts forecast could be the biggest and the strongest of the year so far.A super typhoon has winds of at least 234 kilometers per hour, which is powerful enough to bend a steel tower.If it stays on its projected path, the typhoon will travel towards Japan's Kyushu Island, but there is a low possibility of it impacting Korea.The government is keeping an eye on the storm as it gains strength and could shift course due to differences in surrounding atmospheric pressure.By the middle of the week, it should be clearer whether the typhoon will have an impact on the Korean Peninsula.If Hagibis does have an impact on Korea, it'll be the 8th typhoon this year to do so. That\u2019s a record number of typhoons to affect Korea.The name \u2018Hagibis\u2019 comes from the Philippines and means 'fast' or 'swift'.Choi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
