Sad to say,\u201d Pelosi told reporters as she and the other Democrats emerged from the White House.\n\nThe Democratic leader said Trump had a temper tantrum because so many Republicans joined Democrats to vote for a resolution condemning the president\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northeastern Syria, clearing the way for Turkey\u2019s offensive against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurds.\n\nThe vote was 354 to 60, with dozens of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans joining the majority Democrats. The split underscored deep unhappiness in Congress over Trump\u2019s action, which many lawmakers view as abandoning Kurdish fighters who had been fighting alongside Americans to defeat Islamic State militants.\n\n\u201cI think that vote - the size of the vote, more than 2-1 of the Republicans voted to oppose what the president did - probably got to the president. Because he was shaken up by it,\u201d Pelosi said after emerging from the White House.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we couldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said Pelosi \u201cstormed out.\u201d Representative Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was disappointed to see Democratic leadership walk out of the meeting.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said how Pelosi addressed Trump was inappropriate and they had a productive meeting after she left.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) walks out with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD) to speak with reporters after meeting with President Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S. October 16, 2019.

He didn\u2019t really have one,\u201d Schumer said.", "description": "U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democratic leaders' cut short a White House meeting after Republican President Donald Trump had a \"meltdown\" over a House of Representatives vote condemning his Syria withdrawal.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441622261&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1WB", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
