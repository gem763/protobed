Taiwan dollar TWD=TP gained up to 0.2%, while the Philippine peso and the Indonesian rupiah INR=IN advanced slightly.\n\nThe Singapore dollar was almost unchanged in thin offshore trading.\n\nThe Thai baht THB=TH weakened as much as 0.2% on the day to 30.210 against the dollar after gaining for two consecutive sessions.\n\nCURRENCIES VS U.S. DOLLAR Change on the day at 0620 GMT\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest bid Previous day Pct Move Japan yen\n\n108.730\n\n108.64\n\n-0.08 Sing dlr\n\n1.363\n\n1.3628\n\n+0.00 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.562\n\n30.594\n\n+0.10 Korean won\n\n1169.900\n\n+0.26 Baht\n\n30.210\n\n30.16\n\n-0.17 Peso\n\n51.160\n\n+0.08 Rupiah\n\n14020.000 14030\n\n+0.07\n\n7.062\n\n7.0647\n\n+0.03\n\nChange so far in 2019\n\nCurrency\n\nLatest bid End 2018\n\nPct Move Japan yen\n\n108.730\n\n109.56\n\n+0.76 Sing dlr\n\n1.363\n\n1.3627\n\n-0.01 Taiwan dlr\n\n30.562\n\n30.733\n\n+0.56 Korean won\n\n1169.900\n\n1115.70\n\n-4.63 Baht\n\n30.210\n\n32.55\n\n+7.75 Peso\n\n51.160\n\n52.47\n\n+2.56 Rupiah\n\n14020.000 14375\n\n+2.53 Rupee\n\n70.880\n\n69.77\n\n-1.57 Ringgit\n\n4.185\n\n4.1300\n\n-1.30 Yuan\n\n7.062\n\n6.8730\n\n-2.68", "description": "EM ASIA FX-Most currencies strengthen slightly, won leads gains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC5P0A3_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
