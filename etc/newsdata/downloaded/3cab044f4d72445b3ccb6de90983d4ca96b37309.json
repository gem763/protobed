Several also contain artificial sweeteners. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nAn eye-opening new study that looked at children\u2019s popular sweetened fruit drinks found that they are often loaded with added sugar or contain artificial sweeteners (and in some cases, both). But most parents don\u2019t realize this thanks to manufacturers\u2019 advertising campaigns and packaging, which make these sweetened beverages appear to be healthy choices.\n\nIn the study, researchers at the University of Connecticut\u2019s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity analyzed 34 popular kids\u2019 drinks that contained low-calorie sweeteners and added sugars (such as high-fructose corn syrup and cane juice), as well as drinks without sweeteners, such as 100 percent juice drinks. The study revealed that, overall, 74 percent of children\u2019s sweetened drinks contained low-calorie sweeteners, 65 percent had added sugars, and 38 percent contained both.\n\nIn fact, in 11 different children\u2019s fruit drinks \u2014 \u201cincluding many of the highest-selling brands, such as Capri Sun Juice Drink, Hawaiian Punch, Sunny D, and Minute Maid Lemonade,\u201d per the study \u2014 a single serving contained more than 50 percent of the recommended amount of daily added sugar for children.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, although the majority of the kids\u2019 fruit drinks had images of fruit on the label, most did not contain any fruit juice whatsoever. \u201cMost of them didn\u2019t have any juice,\u201d Jennifer Harris, PhD, lead author of the study and director of marketing initiatives at the University of Connecticut\u2019s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. She notes that even though 85 percent of the drinks showed fruit on the label, only 35 percent contained any juice at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think parents realize that,\u201d she adds.\n\nHarris says that there are a few \u201cegregious\u201d things going on when it comes to the marketing of these sweetened fruit beverages. \u201cThe packaging of the drinks seem to really be designed to make them seem like they\u2019re healthier than they really are \u2014 pictures of fruit on the packages,\u201d she says. \u201cThe sweetened drinks say things like, \u2018Good source of vitamin C\u2019 or \u2018100 percent vitamin C.\u2019 They say \u2018less sugar than the leading juice\u2019 or \u2018less sugar than soda.\u2019 I have parents tell me they\u2019ve been tricked. When they bring them home and look at what\u2019s in it, they can\u2019t believe they bought it.\u201d\n\nHow much sugar should kids be allowed?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the maximum amount of added sugar that kids consume daily is 25 grams. And as Erica Domrose, a clinical dietitian in the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital, tells Yahoo Lifestyle, the sugar that kids consume should primarily come from dairy, whole grains, and fruit.\n\nWhat makes these sweetened fruit drinks deceiving is that, in some cases, the sugar content is lower than other typically sugary beverages, such as soda, because the manufacturers are using artificial sweeteners. \u201cA lot of the products have brought down the sugar by adding the low-calorie sweeteners,\u201d notes Harris. \u201cSo the median was about 16 grams of sugar in a single serving package, which still isn\u2019t great. Some, like Minute Maid Lemonade, is six ounces and has 21 grams of sugar.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know how much artificial sweetener is in these drinks because, according to one study, \u201cthe FDA does not require manufacturers to report the actual amounts of sweeteners contained in foods and beverages.\u201d\n\nHowever, things will change starting on January 1, 2020, when the FDA\u2019s update to the nutrition facts label goes into effect, which requires large brands with $10 million or more in sales to list added sugars on the label found on the back of all products. (Smaller brands have until 2021 to make these changes.)\n\nBut should kids be consuming artificial sweeteners in the first place?\n\nIdeally, no, says Domrose. Although the FDA has approved six artificial sweeteners for use in food and deemed them \u201csafe for consumption,\u201d when it comes to children, \u201cexperts don\u2019t recommend them because there\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019re safe or don\u2019t have a long-term health impact,\u201d says Harris. \u201cSo it\u2019s risky.\u201d\n\nBeyond that, artificial sweeteners also make it that much harder for parents to get their kids to drink water \u2014 which Domrose says is \u201cthe best form of hydration\u201d \u2014 and milk. Harris points out that drinks with artificial sweeteners are also \u201cvery sweet, so even though they don\u2019t have calories, they make it really sweet and if a young child gets used to drinking something very sweet, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to drink plain water and plain milk.\u201d", "description": "A new study that looked at 34 popular children's sweetened fruit drinks found they often contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners (and in some cases, both).
