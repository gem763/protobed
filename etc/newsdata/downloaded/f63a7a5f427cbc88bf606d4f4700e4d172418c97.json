She went on to do this not only for Ada, but her two younger siblings when they came along.\n\nFor decades, Ilona maintained these journals without her family really knowing \u2014 that is, until her eldest, Ada, was in medical school. At the time, Ada was doing her rounds in obstetrics and pediatrics at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto \u2014 the hospital where she was born.\n\nFor Ilona, this was the perfect moment to pass on the journal. Ada was 27, the age Ilona was when she first became a mother.\n\nIlona Posner chose spiral-bound books so she could write in them easily in the bathroom, \"because literally, that's how they were written, mostly.\" (TK Matunda/CBC)\n\nMaking sense of motherhood\n\nIlona says the journals started as a way for her to track her weight gain during her first pregnancy.\n\n\"The week number, this is my weight. And this is measurements from my waistline,\" Ilona explained as she cracked open the first pages of the notebook.\n\nIlona Posner's methodical records of Ada's babyhood. (TK Matunda/CBC)\n\nEach week she diligently recorded her progress \u2014 rows of numbers written in blue ink fill the beginning of the journal. But once she had Ada, the journals had transformed into a way to find order in the chaotic new world of motherhood.\n\nDuring Ilona's first pregnancy, she was in school finishing her masters in computer science. Every day she was surrounded by smart, curious people her own age. But parenting a colicky baby 24/7 changed all that.\n\n\"To go from a full adult in the functioning, working world to at home with baby is huge. It was a transition that was really hard,\" Ilona said.\n\nTo make sense of it all, Ilona treated motherhood like she would a school assignment \u2014 she started graphing baby Ada's behaviours. She came up with a system of symbols, in which smooth lines marked unbroken sleep while stars marked tantrums and crying fits.\n\nIlona recorded everything \u2014 sleep cycles, bowel movements. She even used a little 'L' and 'R' to note what breast she fed from.\n\nFor Ilona Posner, motherhood was worthy of a whole new language. (TK Matunda/CBC)\n\nHour by hour was documented, and before long, Ilona had developed her own shorthand \u2014 one keeping with her computer science expertise.\n\n\"She has her own notation. She has a legend,\" said Ada. \"It's completely indecipherable if you don't have the legend. It just looks like, I don't know \u2014 it looks like a like a graph. Like a computer would have printed out.\"\n\nBut as Ada got older and Ilona grew into motherhood, the journal changed, too. The graph entries melted away, replaced with paragraphs of observations scribbled in blue ink. Soon the journal was filled with these lovingly written vignettes of her little ones.\n\nIlona found herself writing more about the quirkier things, like Ada staunchly refusing to dance in a fashion show at camp.\n\n\"You know, there were some really funny interesting moments,\" said Ilona. \"I think it's fun to have them to be reminded of them later.\"\n\nLike mother, like daughter\n\nWhat Ilona didn't know was that Ada also keeps a journal of sorts, and has been for years. It's not a physical book \u2014 it's more of a long document on her phone where she records funny moments with her friends.\n\nAda doesn't write the date or the time, but her notes paint a strikingly similar picture.\n\n\"I just really wanted to remember funny things that my friend said,\" Ada mused, as we scrolled through the seemingly infinite list.\n\nIlona with Ada as a baby. (Submitted by Ilona Posner)\n\nLike her mother, Ada started keeping her journal during a time of great change. She was a freshman in university and everything was new, exciting and also a bit terrifying. There were a lot of new freedoms and responsibilities, and Ada had the impulse, like Ilona, to start recording her new world.\n\n\"Our friendships [were] forming, like [it was] an important time of our life.\"\n\nDeeper roots\n\nIt turns out that Ada's digital journal and Ilona's baby books were all part of a larger legacy.\n\n\"My father has diaries, very detailed diaries. And he just \u2014 at the age of 70 \u2014 started publishing books,\" revealed Ilona.\n\nTo date, Ilona's father Vladimir Rott has published four books: Father's Letters from Siberian Prison; In Defiance of Fate: Book 1 \u2014 Joy from Sadness; In Defiance of Fate: Book 2 \u2014Joy of Discovery; and Mysovaya Station.\n\nVladimir Rott, Ilona's father, has been an avid journal-keeper his whole life. (TK Matunda/CBC)\n\nThey start with letters from Vladimir's father Ferenc Roth, written from inside a Siberian prison during WWII, and go on to cover Vladimir's life all the way up to the birth of his first grandchild in Canada. The books are very detailed and rely on family diaries, letters and journals.\n\n\"I don't remember anything, but it's in here,\" Ilona said. \"I think it's just interesting to know what happens in your life.\"\n\nNo matter what language it's written in.\n\nAda and Ilona Posner.
