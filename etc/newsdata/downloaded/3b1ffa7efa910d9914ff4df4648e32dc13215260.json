In 1973, Harlan\u2019s coalminers went on strike for 13 months when contract negotiations with Duke Power Company broke down after miners voted to form a union.\n\nThere are no longer any unionized mines in Kentucky, but Harlan\u2019s miners are currently continuing the region\u2019s legacy of labor struggles against wealthy and powerful coal corporations: they are blocking the coal trains from leaving a mine that laid them off.\n\nA collection of tents next to some rail tracks may not look like much compared to that rich legacy of labor struggle. A small group of families have occupied the site since 29 July, sitting on camp chairs, occasionally hosting live music and attracting sympathetic supporters from all over the US.\n\n'Coal is over': the miners rooting for the Green New Deal Read more\n\nThe small protest has endured for more than six weeks now, garnering nationwide attention \u2013 including a video of support from the Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders \u2013 and preventing trains carrying more than $1m worth of coal from being moved out of Harlan county until workers are compensated for the unpaid wages they\u2019re owed since mining firm Blackjewel filed for bankruptcy.\n\nAbout 1,700 coalminers in West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky and Wyoming were laid off without any notice on 1 July when Revelation Energy and it\u2019s affiliate, Blackjewel Coal Company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Unlike other bankruptcies in the coal industry, Blackjewel\u2019s mines have been shut down during proceedings in court and workers experienced previous paychecks and 401k deductions bouncing from their bank accounts, while owed wages were left unpaid.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A coal train passes through Waddy, Kentucky.

A class action lawsuit was filed in July 2019 against Blackjewel for violating the Warn Act, which mandates companies must provide workers with a 60-day written notice in advance of any mass layoffs of 100 or more employees.\n\nThe Rowes had just closed on a new home prior to Blackjewel\u2019s abrupt bankruptcy.\n\nThe laid off miners are currently grappling with what to do next to make ends meet. Several workers have opted to relocate out of the area for better job opportunities. Chris Rowe is one of several laid off miners working on obtaining a commercial driver\u2019s license to work as a truck driver, as his wife, Stacy, plans on enrolling their seven-year old son in a homeschool program in order to travel on the road with him.\n\n\u201cThere is nowhere to get a job unless you move away. For some of us, that\u2019s not possible,\u201d added Rowe. \u201cThe payscale around here is ridiculous because coalminers, they deserve their pay, but there is no middle ground here. There is minimum wage, college or coal.\u201d\n\nRowe explained even after obtaining a college degree, there are no job opportunities to utilize it, which has contributed to a drastic population decline in Harlan county, from over 40,000 in 1980 to around 26,000 today.\n\nCurtis Cress has worked as a coalminer for more than 10 years, and still has a negative bank account due to his bounced paycheck from Blackjewel.\n\n\u201cI almost lost my home. It\u2019s been really hard, when you work a month and they don\u2019t pay you for any of it,\u201d Cress said.\n\nThough around 2,000 jobs have been added to the coal industry since Trump took office, the industry has shed more than 30,000 jobs in the past decade due to automation and market changes in the energy industry. Between 2012 to 2015, eastern Kentucky lost 8,000 coal mining jobs. Coal employment in Harlan county dropped 53.7% in the second quarter of this year compared to last year, driven by Blackjewel\u2019s bankruptcy.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years of working in coalmines, David Pratt is also mulling a new career as a truck driver at the age of 62.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Harlan\u2019s miners are currently continuing the region\u2019s legacy of labor struggles against wealthy and powerful coal corporations by blocking the coal trains from leaving a mine that laid them off.

Blackjewel referred comment to a page with bankruptcy hearing updates.\n\nThe first phase of the project is expected to cost $30m and open in mid to late 2020, while Blackjewel is liable for at least $500m in debt owed to creditors, unpaid taxes and unpaid wages, nearly $10m in payments owed to federal black lung benefits fund, and mine clean up costs that will be passed on to taxpayers if the mine properties aren\u2019t resold.\n\nBlackjewel is one of several coal companies in Kentucky that have not complied with laws requiring them to post bonds to protect miners\u2019 wages in case the company abruptly shuts down.\n\nA federal bankruptcy judge in Charleston, West Virginia, is currently hearing arguments to decide on the fate of the blockaded coal in Harlan county, with Blackjewel arguing the coal was previously sold to a different company, Blackjewel Marketing and Sales Holdings, though the company was formed in December 2017 by Blackjewel Coal Company as part of a joint venture with two other companies.\n\nAs court proceedings to determine when and if Blackjewel\u2019s laid off miners will be compensated for their owed wages and possibly be permitted to return to work, miners and their families are continuing to run the protest camp.\n\nThey have no intention of backing down until they\u2019re paid what they\u2019re owed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay here until we get our money,\u201d said Darrell Raleigh, a laid off Blackjewel miner who spends everyday at the camp with his wife.\n\n\u201cWe have better things to do then sit on the tracks, but that\u2019s what it\u2019s come down to,\u201d said Donna Raleigh. \u201cRain, sleet, snow or hail, we\u2019re going to be here until the checks clear.\u201d", "description": "The protest has endured for more than six weeks, gaining national attention and support from Bernie Sanders", "authors": ["Michael Sainato"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/679a0c4f2864ac9fb21c24a8ce0f3c7c2a0c69e0/0_19_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c87d432ddeeb021faf46300459318679", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
