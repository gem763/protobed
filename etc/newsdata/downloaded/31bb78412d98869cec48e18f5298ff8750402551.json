Almost certainly.\n\nThis Rudolf Straeuli-era side, not long after the major Kamp Staaldraad scandal, had ended runners-up in their pool after a comprehensive 25-6 reverse to eventual champions England.\n\nCome the quarter-final, they were similarly seen off with unpalatable comfort by old enemies the All Blacks, despite that country arguably not having its finest vintage in personnel, either, at the time.\n\nNZ prevailed by three tries to nil, the Boks managing only two penalties and a drop from 20-year-old flyhalf Derick Hougaard.\n\nWhile SA had fielded a few of the players who would go on to become 2007 legends, the likes of lock pairing Matfield and Bakkies Botha were still a little too raw at this level at the time -- only showing what a difference four years can make.\n\n1999: South Africa 44 England 21 (Paris)\n\nCometh the hour, cometh \u2026 Jannie de Beer.\n\nOn a record-breaking day for a Welkom-born, deeply religious flyhalf who might not have played but for Henry Honiball\u2019s problematic hamstring, De Beer made the crucial difference with his personal feast of 34 points, setting a new Bok landmark.\n\nEven more memorably, the bumper tally included a stunning, new global Test best of five dropped goals \u2026 virtually all sweetly struck and landed in an unforgettable 31-minute period of the second half.\n\nThey were critical, too, because this match \u2013 only 2-0 in the try column, both to the Boks \u2013 was dominated by kickers on both sides and the scoreboard only blew out quite late on: it had been a tantalising 25-21 in favour of Nick Mallett\u2019s charges with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nCurrent Bok coach Rassie Erasmus had been on the side of the Bok scrum that day, and widely credited with a strong defensive role whenever the Boks were under the cosh.\n\n1995: South Africa 42 Samoa 14 (Johannesburg)\n\nThe reasonably unfancied Samoans had reached the last eight courtesy of a plucky second-placed finish in their pool behind only England, having eclipsed Argentina and Italy to a \u201cKO\u201d berth.\n\nEarlier thumped 60-8 by the Boks in a pre-RWC clash at the very same Ellis Park, this bruising quarter-final \u2013 featuring a few wild Samoan tackles \u2013 was a bit more competitive, though Francois Pienaar\u2019s charges and later so memorable title-winners still bossed it comfortably in the final analysis.\n\nSouth Africa ran in six tries (to two) and there were stories behind all of them: the major one was Chester Williams\u2019 return.\n\nThe only player of colour in the SA side of the time, he had been injured ahead of RWC \u201995 but earned his ticket back (from the so-timely last eight onwards) because of Pieter Hendriks\u2019 suspension after the \u201cBattle of Boet Erasmus\u201d against Canada.\n\nWilliams duly celebrated with a dazzling four-try haul, setting a Bok record that lasted two years before Pieter Rossouw equalled it (Tonderai Chavhanga later pressed six tries against Uruguay in 2005).\n\nThe other try-scorers were hooker Chris Rossouw -- similarly benefitting from first-choice James \u201cBullet\u201d Dalton\u2019s post-PE ban \u2013 and lock Mark Andrews, playing his last tournament game at lock before Kitch Christie daringly switched him to No 8 for both the semi (France) and the showpiece (New Zealand).\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing ...", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> provides a potted history of the Springboks\u2019 showings (and associated drama/controversy at times) in World Cup quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing - Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7709/9b01c050992a466c97f236e5a0815128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
