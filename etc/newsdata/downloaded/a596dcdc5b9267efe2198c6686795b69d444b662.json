They are widely known to be frugivorous primates who only occasionally feast on small birds or lizards.\"", "description": "Scientists have been stunned after macaques in Malaysia ate so many rats on palm oil plantations that chemical pest control may no longer be needed.", "authors": ["Nick Allen", "Charlotte Runcie", "Jan Etherington", "Philip Johnston", "Con Coughlin"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213808841-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeoMPseA8rXxS7fV2a1a45VYWHf9y8mJOlf1-Oajhd-g.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
