But for Arpan Nanavati, the opportunity to take the digital skills he honed at Walmart and try to disrupt the fashion industry at Moda Operandi was a no brainer.\n\nWhile they are ultimately peddling different products, the job of executives in both sectors is anticipating and managing customer expectations. More commonly, those two tasks are achieved through technology like machine learning and artificial intelligence. So when Nanavati came on as chief technology officer at Moda, he knew a key step to solving a pressing problem in the fashion industry was harnessing consumer information.\n\n\"Tech is driving that strategy to optimize and monetize the data,\" he told Business Insider. The core problems, \"which have not been solved before, is how we can leverage data and tech to understand fashion taste.\"\n\nNanavati previously served as the director of engineering at Walmart Labs, where he managed the company's online grocery platform. Now at Moda, he plans to use the customer-centric mindset he honed at the retail behemoth's technology arm to create personalized shopping experiences. He'll focus on tackling two key challenges in his new role: how to better match customers with fashion recommendations and deliver that product in the quickest way. Underscoring both of these areas is technology, which makes the role of chief technology officer even more critical.\n\nModa allows customers to purchase clothes shown in runway shows directly from the designers, a shift from the historic paradigm in which major retailers like Barneys would decide which items to put on the store floor.\n\nIn his first interview since joining, Nanavati shared what he believes are the top tasks of chief technology officers and why a culture of \"extreme ownership\" is critical to achieving them.\n\nHire the right people and localize decision-making\n\nIncreasingly, technology is becoming a more central part of the organization as industries like financial services and retail pursue digital overhauls. But making it a priority comes with its own challenges, particularly for industries that have traditionally viewed IT as an outpost to solve issues like computer problems.\n\n\"Tech-driven strategy is very common when it's a tech company,\" Nanavati said. That's different from consumer-focused companies like retailers, where tech goes from being an \"institutional arm to being a strategy arm.\"\n\nTo help navigate that shift, Nanavati tries to instill a culture of \"extreme ownership\" in his team. That means thinking about problems and solutions from the lens of the business owner and, in Moda's case, taking an approach that many software engineers and other tech workers may not be used to.\n\n\"In our case, it is truly cross-functional because you have to be able to understand the fashion designers, your merchandising team, and not just have an engineering mindset,\" he said. \"You have to think like an owner, and you have to be able to connect the dots from the consumer perspective and the business-owner perspective.\"\n\nMarrying engineering prowess with customer insights\n\nAn increasing barrier to digital-transformation efforts is teaching employees with traditional tech backgrounds to use what is often anecdotal evidence \u2014 like a desire among customers for quicker shipping \u2014 from other business units to develop solutions.\n\nAnd the impediment can spell doom for digital efforts. A recent survey of companies that pursued major tech initiatives found that just 14% of the respondents said their attempts resulted in sustained performance improvement. Culture remains a key reason for the struggle.\n\nTo try to overcome those issues, Moda localizes decision-making. The company forms what it calls \"squads,\" or small teams that include representatives from different parts of the business, including sales and IT. Those groups physically sit together in the office and are empowered to make decisions and act on them without explicit buy-in from the brass.\n\nCompanies will take different approaches to changing the culture to one focused on big data and advanced tech. Ultimately, however, executives need to find ways to marry the expertise of the engineering team with the customer insight that is often siloed in other parts of the business to craft solutions that actually improve the costumer experience.", "description": "Arpan Nanavati is hoping to use consumer data to solve one of the industry's core problems: understanding fashion taste.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d925d582e22af4eee5c0a49?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
