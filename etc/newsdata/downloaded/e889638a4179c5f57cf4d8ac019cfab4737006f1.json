But NOAA isn\u2019t laughing \u2014 and neither should we.", "language": "en", "text": "There are a couple of problems with that. The first is that Trump\u2019s own argument implies he\u2019s being deceptive. The second is that treating \u201cSharpie-gate\u201d as a meaningless distraction completely misses the point.\n\nLet\u2019s think for a second about what Trump tweeted Saturday night. He suggested that he\u2019s not really doing all this because of Alabama and Dorian but rather to mess with people. (It would seem odd that someone who is so effectively pulling the wool over people\u2019s eyes would come out and tell them that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing, but let\u2019s set that aside for a second.) He\u2019s effectively saying that he spent a full week of his presidency trolling the country with a trivial debate.\n\nThe thing about trolling is that it\u2019s an inherently dishonest act. You get people to react to what you\u2019re doing by saying something that you don\u2019t really or fully believe. It sounds a lot like Trump is saying that his incorrect tweet warning about severe impacts from Dorian in Alabama was meant to elicit the outrage it received, or that his repeated defenses of the false tweet were meant to drag the story out rather than inform. Why can\u2019t it just be him defending himself against a supposedly false allegation? Why float an ulterior motive for all of this?\n\nProbably because, as with many of Trump\u2019s falsehoods, it\u2019s an attractive alternate explanation for his supporters. The president has spent a week defending blatantly false information with nonsensical explanations, and nobody (well, almost nobody) can pretend otherwise. Better, then, to believe he\u2019s doing it for some reason besides that he\u2019s lying or is completely divorced from reality. It invites people to believe he\u2019s really that secret political genius, wielding dishonesty for an actual purpose.\n\nBut even if we accept that explanation, this is hardly trivial. Even some mainstream journalists have pretended this whole thing isn\u2019t worthy of all of our time or attention. But this was the president providing false information about a dangerous hurricane that was contradicted in real time by the National Weather Service. It\u2019s better that he was overselling the danger for Alabama rather than underselling it, but he was still providing misinformation. What happens if he does that erring in the other direction?\n\nAnd since then, we have seen Trump offer non-sequitur defenses. These include pointing to hurricane projection maps that were badly outdated at the time of his Alabama tweet and getting a rear admiral on the National Security Council to provide a statement alluding to \u201cthe possibility of tropical storm force winds\u201d in Alabama (Trump, in fact, had suggested a much more severe and likely \u201chit\u201d). By Friday night, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a highly unorthodox and unsigned statement rebuking the Birmingham NWS office for its tweet contradicting Trump \u2014 a move that has drawn criticism from former NWS heads and the NWS employees\u2019 union.\n\nThere are very real questions about how all this came to be, including whether the White House applied pressure on a government agency to misleadingly toe his political line. Reporters have quickly submitted FOIA requests for documentation of contacts between the White House and NOAA. We may never find proven wrongdoing, but the whole situation is remarkably suspicious \u2014 especially given the White House\u2019s and Trump\u2019s tendency to inject politics into generally nonpolitical government agencies and documented efforts to get them to do pretty much exactly what NOAA just did.\n\nWe know that NOAA leadership last week warned staff against contradicting Trump. Now its chief scientist is investigating whether the agency violated NOAA policies and ethics, calling the agency\u2019s response \u201cpolitical\u201d and a \u201cdanger to public health and safety.\u201d And NWS Director Louis Uccellini is defending the forecasters whom NOAA rebuked in its unsigned statement.\n\nIt\u2019s overly reductive to talk about this as if it\u2019s just about an errant tweet Trump sent one weekend in the summer of 2019. It\u2019s about a president who continually misinforms the American people and why and how the government around him participates in that misinformation.\n\nAnd the president himself practically admitted this weekend that it\u2019s all a big game to him.", "description": "Even some mainstream reporters are suggesting this is a non-issue.
