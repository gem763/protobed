The committees intend to depose Parnas on Oct. 10.\n\nParnas, who divides his time between Boca Raton, Fla., and New York City, played a central role in introducing Giuliani to ousted Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin. Biden\u2019s successful campaign to get Shokin dismissed from his post was the basis of Trump\u2019s request for Ukrainian help in investigating alleged corruption on the part of the former vice president and his son Hunter. Shokin had investigated a Ukrainian company on whose board Hunter Biden served, but the investigation had ended by the time Joe Biden got involved in early 2016.\n\nParnas was also involved in setting up meetings between Giuliani and the man who succeeded Shokin as prosecutor general, Yuri Lutsenko. Lutsenko initially suspected Biden of corruption in Shokin\u2019s firing, and while Giuliani publicized that theory, Lutsenko investigated it and determined it to be false.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, he did not violate anything,\u201d Lutsenko said of the accusations against Biden.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s relationship with Parnas has deepened over the past two years, and the two men are believed to have traveled to Ukraine together in search of more dirt on Biden, who for months has led Trump in one-on-one polls of a possible 2020 presidential election matchup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good friends,\u201d Parnas said of Giuliani in an interview with NPR. \u201cWe play golf together.\u201d\n\nOn March 31, Giuliani brought Parnas and Fruman to a fundraising dinner of the National Council of Young Israel, an Orthodox Jewish group that describes itself on its website as \u201cembracing Americanism and Zionism through the prism of Torah-true Judaism.\u201d\n\nThe two have been prolific fundraisers for the Republican Party. Their natural gas company, Global Energy Producers, has donated more than $400,000 to GOP candidates and committees. It has also given $325,000 to a pro-Trump super-PAC called America First Action, a gift that led the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. Global Energy Producers, the group says, is a shell corporation set up for the \u201cpurpose of anonymously funneling\u201d large donations.\n\nParnas, who calls Trump \u201cone of the greatest presidents we have\u201d and who has met the president at the White House and at Mar-a-Lago, has conceded that the way he wired the money to America First Action was \u201ca mistake,\u201d but told NPR that \u201cit\u2019s a whole misunderstanding that my attorneys are going to clear up.\u201d\n\nGlobal Energy Producers, however, has no listed office address or phone number, the Washington Post reported, and appears to have no ongoing business that could have generated enough revenue to support hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to American politicians and groups.\n\nParnas himself has been sued multiple times over business and personal debts, the Miami Herald reported Tuesday, including by Dianne and Michael Pues, who say they loaned him $350,000 to finance a Hollywood film titled \u201cAnatomy of an Assassin.\u201d A federal judge in New York has ruled that Parnas must pay more than $500,000 to the Pues family trust. The couple are still seeking restitution.\n\n\u201cMr. Parnas is a con man, he is a crook,\u201d Dianne Pues told the Herald. \u201cHe conned us from day one.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Democrats conducting an impeachment inquiry against President Trump are seeking information from a Soviet-born businessman named Lev Parnas, who has worked with Rudy Giuliani and officials in Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oIw8eo2wBvOwta2vrxvsHQ--~B/aD05NzI7dz0xMzk4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/d8250da0-e542-11e9-8724-d5e4692f883a", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
