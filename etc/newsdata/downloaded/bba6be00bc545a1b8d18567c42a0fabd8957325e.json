Her mother told The Argus: \u201cThis is very out of character, she is normally so organised.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. The police have confirmed she is missing \u2013 apparently the embassy is closed until Monday. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any urgency.\u201d\n\nMs Bambridge is hoping Amelia got lost on the way back from the beach, which is reportedly an unlit 40-minute journey through a densely forested area.\n\nRyan Harris, an 18-year-old from Worcester who had met Amelia a week ago and briefly travelled with her as part of a group of friends, said people across the island, which is roughly 15km long, were banding together to find her.\n\n\u201cPeople are diving. People are checking the jungles and the beaches,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cPolice sent three search teams out, so they\u2019re helping as well. It\u2019s a whole island thing now. Everyone\u2019s looking.\u201d\n\nA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said it is assisting Amelia\u2019s family and is in close contact with the Cambodian police.\n\nAmelia\u2019s sister, Georgie, told The Argus: \u201cShe is strong-minded, really sensible and very organised. She spent the last year googling solo female travelling, looking at pages and blogs and sorting out everything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just in shock, she has never done anything like this before.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by PA", "description": "A 21-year-old British backpacker who disappeared after a beach party on a Cambodian island has been declared missing.Police and volunteers on the island of Koh Rong are searching for Amelia Bambridge, a former student from West Sussex who was last seen by friends on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XGcosCRKUI_k3WzuFdxZ7w--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/0e756924fc47093ced4a9c611ffa439d", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
