They should stop importing censorship and oppression to America.\n\nJackie Robinson did more than take first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947. As Americans across the country tuned into their favorite pastime, Robinson took a stand for freedom. His bravery, courage and tremendous natural talent allowed him to pave the way for a cultural revolution and the integration of all Americans, regardless of color or creed.\n\nWhether it\u2019s baseball in America, cricket in India or rugby in New Zealand, sports teams are influential in forming the identity of a nation and direction of a culture.\n\nIn a country where citizens are routinely censored, surveilled and oppressed, and hundreds of thousands of Uighurs are persecuted and detained, basketball is one of the last remnants of American influence in China from before its 1949 communist revolution. That\u2019s why lawmakers from both parties, Americans across the country, and people around the world were deeply concerned by the NBA\u2019s initial statement of regret in the face of Chinese government disapproval and pressure after an American citizen\u2019s exercise of free speech this month.\n\nHong Kong tweet that lit a firestorm\n\nAccording to the league, 800 million people in China watched NBA programming last year alone. As the most influential sports league in China, the NBA has the opportunity to stand for freedom with the poise and courage of Robinson. Instead, the NBA is choosing to pander to the brutal and oppressive Communist Party in China, putting American values aside for multibillion dollar deals.\n\nTo recap, this all started with a single tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who signaled support for peaceful, pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. This one tweet (\"Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong\") was enough to send the Chinese Communist Party into a tailspin. Out of fear of losing its five-year, $1.5 billion broadcasting contract with Tencent, a tool of the Chinese government, the NBA and its athletes backpedaled and began profusely apologizing.\n\nSen.

Tongo/epa-EFE)\n\nMorey\u2019s tweet is just one example of how far the Chinese Communist Party will go to advance its authoritarian regime and silence anyone daring to speak against Chinese oppression and for freedom. The party is increasingly relying on its military to bully its neighbors and threaten American interests. It uses economic and diplomatic coercion to blackmail poor nations, leaving our allies isolated and undermined. And despite the massive peaceful demonstrations by protesters and a commitment memorialized in law to protect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, the Chinese Communist Party continues to blatantly ignore the democratic will of the people \u2014 oppressing free speech and trampling basic human rights.\n\nThe same week the NBA bowed to pressure from the Chinese Communist Party, I traveled to Tokyo, Taipei, New Delhi and Hong Kong, where I saw firsthand the geopolitical threat China poses to our friends and allies in the region.\n\nStand with free speech allies\n\nIn Japan, I met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and senior members of the Japanese government, and we discussed the effect of China\u2019s aggressive military expansionism and the important role of the U.S. partnership \u2014 both militarily, with the Texas-manufactured F-35 fighter craft, and economically, with our recently signed trade agreement.\n\nIn Tapei, President Tsai Ing-wen, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and I discussed how China works overtime to isolate Taiwan and undercut its autonomy. I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan TAIPEI Act, which underscores America\u2019s support for the people of Taiwan and commits to standing against China\u2019s efforts to undermine Taiwan. As China\u2019s threats intensify, the United States must stand unflinchingly with the people of Taiwan.\n\nHuman rights abuse: I've fought China's slow-motion genocide of Uighur Muslims. Now, my family are victims.\n\nIn India, during my meetings with the defense minister and commerce secretary, we discussed how our military relationship and economic partnership stabilizes the region, as China seeks to use its military to bully and coerce its neighbors.\n\nAnd in Hong Kong, where free enterprise abounds and per capita income is five times higher than in China, up to 2 million protesters have taken to the streets to fight for their freedom. Brave men and women, boys and girls are standing up demanding that the Chinese Communist Party protect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, protect free speech and defend human rights.\n\nBuying silence from corporate America\n\nI am hopeful Congress will pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act and send it to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk to be signed into law. This bill specifically includes my bipartisan amendment to the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992. It will strengthen oversight over Hong Kong policy, in response to expanding moves by the Chinese Communist Party to exploit Hong Kong and circumvent the laws of the United States.\n\nFor too long, China has been allowed to carry out its tyrannical actions in the dark of night. The Chinese Communist Party has used coercion and blackmail to buy silence not just from the NBA, which receives billions of dollars from the country, but also from industry empires like Apple, Google and Nike.\n\nTime to step down? Rockets' Daryl Morey should resign to preserve the NBA\u2019s revenue, investments and goodwill\n\nI have long condemned U.S. companies that turn a blind eye to, and in some cases carry out, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s censorship, oppression and human rights atrocities, and I will continue working with my colleagues to hold those companies accountable, and ensure that they are not importing Chinese oppression to the United States.\n\nThe American people expect more from the companies they trust and the sports leagues they cheer. American sports leagues and companies alike should embrace the courage of Jackie Robinson\u2019s legacy. They may just find themselves paving the way for a cultural revolution worth fighting for.\n\nTed Cruz is a Republican senator from Texas and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
