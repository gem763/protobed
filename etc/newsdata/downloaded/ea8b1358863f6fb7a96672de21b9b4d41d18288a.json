So they\u2019ve become a highly valued addition to enrolment, positively received by students - and are a strong example of an important student-led national campaign.\"\n\nThe University of Oxford is another institution to introduce mandatory sexual consent workshops.", "description": "Universities are making students undergo \u2018consent courses\u2019 before enrolling for degrees, a report representing Britain's vice-chancellors has found.", "authors": ["Gabriella Swerling", "Social Affairs Editor", "Howard Riddle", "Philip Johnston"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/01/02/TELEMMGLPICT000145062986-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
