The administration rightly declared Beijing a strategic rival and placed Huawei, China\u2019s multinational telecommunications giant, on the Commerce Department\u2019s so-called \u201centity list\u201d as a national-security threat. This prevents U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei.\n\nChina is a dangerous rival in artificial intelligence and machine learning. But for now it still depends on about 30 U.S. companies to supply Huawei with the core components it needs to compete in the 5G market. As long as Huawei remains on the entity list, it will lack crucial technology and be seriously weakened.\n\nThe coming years will therefore be crucial in determining whether the U.S. or China comes out ahead in 5G. The current situation strongly favors the U.S. However, President Trump may soon undermine his own China policy and cede the advantage to Beijing.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Gallagher introduced an amendment in July to the National Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit President Trump from removing Huawei from the entity list without the consent of Congress. Sen. Mitt Romney introduced a similar amendment in the Senate. President Trump wants to remove this constraint. In my view, he wants to arrange a meeting with President Xi Jinping as the 2020 election approaches and make a trade deal with him, and he wants Huawei\u2019s status on the table as one of his bargaining chips.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Mr. Trump made an ill-conceived concession to China. Last year he lifted restrictions on ZTE, Huawei\u2019s smaller rival, after it had evaded U.S. sanctions. If he gives Huawei a similar break, removing it from the entity list as part of a trade deal, the company could consolidate its leading position in the 5G market.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know exactly what\u2019s motivating Mr. Trump, but he appears desperate for a deal with President Xi to bolster the U.S. stock market and economy to improve his chances at re-election\u2014putting his electoral interests ahead of America\u2019s interests.\n\nCongress must prevent this from happening. Mr. Trump\u2019s own Defense Department and National Security Council recognize the grave threat Huawei poses. If Republicans allow Mr. Trump to bail out the Communist Party-run telecom giant, they will be abdicating their most basic democratic responsibilities.\n\nAs founder of the Open Society Foundations, my interest in defeating Xi Jinping\u2019s China goes beyond U.S. national interests. As I explained in a speech in Davos earlier this year, I believe that the social-credit system Beijing is building, if allowed to expand, could sound the death knell of open societies not only in China but also around the globe. Despots will be eager to buy the know-how of Chinese companies, making them politically and financially dependent on China and expanding Beijing\u2019s systems of political control world-wide.\n\nMr. Soros is founder of the Open Society Foundations.", "description": "His China policy is a great achievement.
