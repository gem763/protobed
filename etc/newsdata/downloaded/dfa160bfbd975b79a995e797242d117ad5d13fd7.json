The lesson, they crowed on Twitter, is never give up, keep fighting \u2014 and the battle is worth it.\n\nWalter Shaub, the former head of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, posted: \u201cBlam! NEVER doubt that the public\u2019s efforts to hold this corrupt administration accountable is worth all the effort.\u201d\n\nShaub had just declared in an MSNBC interview Friday that if Trump hosting the G-7 summit at his own golf resort \u201cis not corrupt, nothing is corrupt.\u201d\n\nBlam! NEVER doubt that the public's efforts to hold this corrupt administration accountable is worth all the effort!! Remember this, my friends, as we continue to fight for the integrity of our government and for democracy. https://t.co/470A00TksT \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 20, 2019\n\nI am so pleased, I don't even care that I wrote \"efforts\" instead of \"effort.\" I hope everyone will take the lesson from this that accountability in the age of Trump comes first and foremost from the PEOPLE. Take heart and redouble the effort. Your republic is worth the trouble. https://t.co/KJK6KsreVL \u2014 Walter Shaub (@waltshaub) October 20, 2019\n\nThe watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said Trump\u2019s reversal proves that \u201cpressure works,\u201d and urged: \u201cKeep fighting.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s reversal shows that pressure works, that those fighting to hold the line for ethical government can sometimes dial down his corruption. He deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing. https://t.co/1lmXfJIQgh \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) October 20, 2019\n\nKeep fighting. The pressure works. Rest assured, we will not let a single corrupt conflict of interest go. https://t.co/196NHaQFJl \u2014 Citizens for Ethics (@CREWcrew) October 20, 2019\n\nLet\u2019s be clear, the G7 meeting is the tip of the iceberg of Trump\u2019s corruption.\n\n\n\nBut organizing matters and it works.\n\n\n\nPublic pressure matters and it works.\n\n\n\nKeep fighting. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \u2014 Sean Eldridge (@SeanEldridge) October 20, 2019\n\nJust heard about Doral. Good job, everybody. \u2014 Elie Mystal (@ElieNYC) October 20, 2019\n\nWonder if @realDonaldTrump will learn anything from the Doral Debacle? Or if he knows the tide may be turning on the guy on 5th Avenue. The constitution is one heck of a durable document. \u2014 Wendy R. Sherman (@wendyrsherman) October 20, 2019\n\nSo President Trump was forced to concede that it wasn\u2019t OK at the OK Doral. \u2014 Dan Rather (@DanRather) October 20, 2019\n\nBREAKING: Bowing to pressure, Trump says his Doral resort will no longer host the G7 summit https://t.co/mMGIWHIOuM \u2014 Jon Cooper \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@joncoopertweets) October 20, 2019\n\nTrump never admits being wrong on anything. Now, after fierce criticism for clear self-dealing, he says he won't hold G-7 at his own hotel after all. One more sign that he is feeling threatened and running scared. \u2014 Tony Schwartz (@tonyschwartz) October 20, 2019\n\nWhy did @realDonaldTrump reverse his decision to award a massive government contract to himself and his family? Because the American people said NO.\n\n\n\nAnd for all those Republicans who remained silent or defended Trump's initial decision to hold the G-7 at Doral, shame on you. https://t.co/fxjZ17PUXd \u2014 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) October 20, 2019\n\nThe G-7 may no longer be at Trump National Doral, but that won\u2019t stop foreign nations from dumping money into Donald Trump's pockets by spending at his hotels. And it won\u2019t stop Trump from rewarding Mar-a-Lago members with ambassadorships. https://t.co/thpJT1dGuT \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 20, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s decided he\u2019s committed enough Impeachable offenses, why add another by holding the G-7 meeting at The Doral. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) October 20, 2019\n\nOkay, are you all ready for this?\n\n\n\nNow that the G7 won\u2019t be at Doral, there was absolutely no reason for Mick Mulvaney to give a presser.\n\n\n\nBut he gave one, and in the process, admitted to a quid pro quo on Ukraine.\n\n\n\nHahahahahahah! \u2014 Michelangelo Signorile (@MSignorile) October 20, 2019\n\nSay what now?\n\n\n\nBut I thought Doral was the best place to have it. Whatever shall we do...https://t.co/9iWRj4RK0d \u2014 Kaz Weida (@kazweida) October 20, 2019\n\nThe president who never backs down?\n\n\n\nJust backed down.https://t.co/ozciz48Xyq \u2014 S.V.
