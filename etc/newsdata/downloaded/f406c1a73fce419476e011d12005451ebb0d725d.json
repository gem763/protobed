Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nMembers of Congress cannot be impeached, but the Constitution says each House of Congress \"may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.\" Members may also be censured.\n\nTrump last week used similar language in attacks targeting House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) for exaggerating a partial transcript of the July 25 call between the president and Ukraine\u2019s leader.\n\nAt the time, Trump suggested that Schiff should be arrested for treason, which is punishable by death or a prison term.\n\nDuring a televised congressional hearing, Schiff said that Trump directed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to \u201cmake up dirt on my political opponent\u201d a full \u201cseven times.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat defended his comments amid backlash from Republicans at the time, saying: \"Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times,\u2019 my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d\n\nIt was also reported last week that the whistleblower at the center of a House impeachment inquiry into Trump contacted Schiff's committee before filing a complaint.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks late Sunday came shortly after reports emerged of a second whistleblower said to have firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations detailed in the original complaint.\n\nMark Zaid, an attorney at the firm that represents the whistleblower who filed the original complaint regarding Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine, said that he was representing the second whistleblower.\n\nZaid said the second whistleblower is also an intelligence official and has direct knowledge of some of the allegations detailed in the original complaint.\n\nAccording to Zaid, the second whistleblower has already spoken to the head of the intelligence community's internal watchdog office, Michael Atkinson. However, they have not yet spoken with congressional committees investigating Trump\u2019s communications with Ukraine.\n\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham Stephanie GrishamWhite House says Turkey will soon launch Syria operation White House dismisses news of second whistleblower: Trump 'has done nothing wrong' Intel Dem: No reason for White House to defy subpoena unless Trump is 'guilty' MORE defended Trump after reports surfaced of the second whistleblower, and said \"it doesn't matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers about the same telephone call.\"\n\nShe also said that it \"doesn't change the fact that he has done nothing wrong.\"\n\n--This report was updated at 7:59 a.m.", "description": "President Trump late Sunday suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was guilty of treason, and should be \u201cimmediately\u201d impeached.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald1_093019_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
