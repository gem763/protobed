However, donations made in cryptocurrency, to politicians, are not required to be disclosed.\n\nJapan has historically been quite progressive towards regulating cryptocurrency. Last year, the country granted the cryptocurrency industry self-regulatory status.\n\nBut bear in mind, on this occasion, this appears to be the minister\u2019s interpretation of existing laws. How other\u2019s will see this remains to be seen.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound sustainable that cryptocurrency-based donations don\u2019t have to be declared.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission in the US allows politicians and political committees to receive donations in Bitcoin, but their values must be declared at the time they\u2019re received.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
