its business include instructing law enforcement to \"threaten, menace, coerce, entice, and incite\" current and former employees to turn against the company.\n\nThe US allegedly denied visas to Huawei workers, detained shipments at ports, and used undercover operatives to pose as Huawei employees to establish legal pretence for unfounded accusations against the company.\n\nThe US is also accused of launching cyber attacks against Huawei in order to infiltrate the firm's intranet and internal communication systems.\n\n\"None of the accusations levied by the US government have been supported with sufficient evidence,\" Huawei's statement concluded.\n\n\"We strongly condemn the malign, concerted efforts by the US government to discredit Huawei and curb its leadership position in the industry.\"", "description": "Huawei has staunchly denied accusations that it stole US patents for its smartphone design and accused the US government\u00a0of carrying out an
