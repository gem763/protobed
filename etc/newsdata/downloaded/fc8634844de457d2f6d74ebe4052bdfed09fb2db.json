This dip was shortly followed by a major price surge that saw bitcoin briefly reach above $10,000 over the weekend.\n\nDespite the price turmoil over the last week bitcoin has managed to avoid the so-called Death Cross \u2013 a market pattern that takes place when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nProminent cryptocurrency analyst Nigel Green, who is the chief executive of the deVere Group financial advisory firm, believes bitcoin will experience more gains and hit $12,000 before the end of the year \u2013 so long as it is able to stay above the key support level of $8,500 this week.\n\n\u201cBitcoin has registered some impressive gains over the last 48 hours after being in a lull period in recent weeks,\u201d Mr Green told The Independent. \u201cThe $8,500 support has previously acted as a crucial support for bitcoin. I believe that if bitcoin traders can keep the price above this over the next week, the world\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency will experience a breakout.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Speaking at the Political Bureau of the Central Committee last week, President Xi described bitcoin\u2019s underlying blockchain technology as an \u201cimportant breakthrough\u201d and said more should be done to encourage its development.\n\nHe added that China should \u201cseize the opportunity\u201d offered by blockchain technology and accelerate its development.\n\nHis comments add weight to rumours that China is developing its own cryptocurrency, which is expected to be revealed early next year.
