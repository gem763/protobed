Some of the stuff that we were presented with: how hot it was for some of the players at certain times \u2013 up to 50 degrees in the middle \u2013 how dangerous it was for them. How the risks affects local club cricket, how clubs have had their changing rooms destroyed by flooding in the UK, how the rising temperatures affect the way grass grows, was scary.\u201d\n\nThe report, written by academics and sports scientists, focused particularly on how heat affects players and called for cricket\u2019s administrators to protect players and reduce the game\u2019s own carbon footprint. It pointed out that batsmen and women are uniquely vulnerable to the heat, covered up by protective clothing which limits their ability to sweat, and running a succession of 22-yard sprints for up to eight hours a day. It came up with a number of recommendations, from players wearing shorts to play being abandoned during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nThe Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n\n\u201cThe game has to have a plan, a strategy for how we adapt for it. It wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d really talked about with ex-cricketers until this year at Lord\u2019s. I was really taken aback. I\u2019m lucky enough to be on these committees with some very intelligent people and I hope they can come up with something. I\u2019m more than happy to put my hand up, and sit down at a round-the-table discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have got three children \u2013 22, 20 and just about to turn 18 \u2013 it\u2019s a different world for them. People want to put their head in the sand, and say I\u2019m not going to be around in 50 years.
