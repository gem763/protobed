It\u2019s barely bigger than an 8\u00d711 sheet of paper. The man holding it is not obstructing anyone\u2019s view \u2014 it\u2019s an NBA preseason game on a weeknight, there are tons of empty seats \u2014 and he\u2019s not being profane, disruptive, or creating any problem for any other fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo political signs,\u201d the security guy says \u2014 and to the extent we can read his body language, at least initially he doesn\u2019t appear eager to enforce this edict. But when asked if he knows what the Uighurs are, he responds, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in having a political conversation.\u201d\n\nI presume he has never, as the sign recommended, googled to learn more about the Uighurs. There are anywhere from one million to two million Uighurs in concentration camps in Western China. Human rights organizations have detailed that those camps are rife with torture, abuse, rapes, forced abortions, and sterilizations. The Chinese government is destroying traditional Uighur burial grounds and paving over their graveyards. The Chinese government is attempting to completely erase Uighur culture; what we are witnessing is a slow-motion state-sponsored genocide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut arena staff, presumably taking their instructions from Wizards owner Ted Leonsis and/or the NBA as a whole, believed \u201cGoogle Uighurs\u201d is too political a sign to have at the game. The Washington Wizards have welcomed and saluted Joe Biden at their games, but that wasn\u2019t too political. Players wore \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d t-shirts after Eric Garner\u2019s death, but that wasn\u2019t too political. (Apparently the NBA is fine with protesting American police brutality, but not Hong Kong police brutality.) The Miami Heat wore hoodies in warmups \u201cin solidarity with Trayvon Martin\u201d in 2012, and two years earlier, the Phoenix Suns wore \u201cLos Suns\u201d jerseys to protest that controversial Arizona immigration law. So clearly some forms of political protest are not merely tolerated or accepted but endorsed by NBA teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut any protest relating to China is unacceptable.\n\nAnother pro-Hong Kong sign was taken away by security during the United States National Anthem. It was taken away before the singer got to the lyric \u201cin the land of the free and home of the brave.\u201d Please consult your doctor before consuming such painfully concentrated doses of irony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCesar Conda says he saw another fan kicked out for chanting, \u201cfree Hong Kong.\u201d (As Conda notes, fans yell exceptionally rude things at the referees or opposing players and no one minds.) Candice Bucker has video footage of security confronting another pair of fans. Patrick Hedger says he got kicked out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesman for the Wizards contends no one was asked to leave the game. In other news, the Chinese government contends that \u201cmost people\u201d have been released from the concentration camps. (Never mind that footage from drones posted last week shows hundreds of people bound and blindfolded being unloaded off a train into camps.)\n\nMeanwhile, up in New York, building security told a man protesting outside NBA headquarters that he couldn\u2019t stand too close to the building.\n\nWe are living through a clash of two systems \u2014 one free, and one unfree, and the battlefield is right here in our own country. It is not \u201ca time for choosing,\u201d as Ronald Reagan said in his famous speech; the choice has already been made. And many of the biggest, wealthiest, and most powerful institutions in this country have made their choice: They support the unfree side and will voluntarily enforce its edicts.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what could unite Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ted Cruz, as well as . . . this is it. They, along with Senator Ben Sasse, Senator Tom Cotton, Senator Ron Wyden, Representative Mike Gallagher, and others have written to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and urged him to \u201csuspend NBA activities in China until government-controlled broadcasters and government-controlled commercial sponsors end their boycott of NBA activities and the selective treatment of the Houston Rockets, and emphasize that the association will stand unified in the face of future efforts by Chinese government-controlled entities to single out individual teams, players, or associates for boycotts or selective treatment,\u201d and \u201creevaluate the NBA\u2019s training camp in Xinjiang, where up to a million Chinese citizens are held in concentration camps as part of a massive, government-run campaign of ethno-religious repression.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver in Slate, Tom Scocca points out the ugly truth that Silver and the rest of the NBA don\u2019t want to confront: If the Chinese government had this kind of a furious and heavy-handed reaction to a tweet, they\u2019re only going to get worse in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina has already played its hand. If Hong Kong is non-negotiable, there\u2019s nothing to discuss. The subject will become more sensitive, not less, if the Hong Kong police move from tear gas and rubber bullets to the routine use of live ammunition, or if the People\u2019s Liberation Army moves in. Would the NBA muzzle its employees then? Would the players and staff of a globally prominent American company censor their own feelings to protect the Chinese market? Why not take the stand before it gets to that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am sure that the tweet from Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey deeply offended the Chinese government. You know what ought to offend all of us? Running concentration camps and brutal crackdowns and then expecting Americans to restrict the speech of other Americans on behalf of those running those concentration camps and brutal crackdowns.\n\nWe\u2019re Abandoning the Kurds\n\nBehold, the fruits of a sudden change in American policy in the Middle East: \u201cFighting lit up the sky early Thursday as Turkish troops pressed their air and ground offensive against United States-allied Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. At least 16 Kurds were reported to have been killed, one monitoring group said.\u201d\n\nTo say the members of the U.S. military who worked with and fought alongside the Kurds against ISIS are distraught is an understatement. \u201cI am ashamed for the first time in my career,\u201d one told Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin. \u201cWe met every single security agreement. The Kurds met every single agreement. There was NO threat to the Turks \u2013 NONE \u2013 from this side of the border. This is insanity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMembers of the military are not infallible, but when everyone at the Pentagon, everyone in the intelligence community, and all of our allies and every expert on the region thinks a decision is a bad move, it takes a remarkably obstinate man to insist that he\u2019s right and everyone else who\u2019s been studying this region from the beginning is wrong. There is a willful blindness to the consequences and a message sent to every country and population around the world. The Kurds did everything the United States could possibly want against a foe that stunned the world with its cruelty, brutality, barbarism, and bloodthirstiness. And once our commander in chief believed we didn\u2019t need them anymore \u2014 which is different from actually not needing them anymore \u2014 our country chatted with Recep Erdogan and let the Turks tear them apart.\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating to see the president\u2019s defenders insisting that we have to acquiesce to this long-desired military aggression on the part of the Turks. Funny, Turkey\u2019s been our NATO ally all along, and up until last week, we believed it was a priority to keep the Turks \u2014 our fair-weather allies against ISIS \u2014 and the Kurds, our all-weather allies against ISIS, from going at each other.\n\nThe departure of U.S. forces means we\u2019re no longer around to help the Kurds imprison 11,000 captured ISIS fighters. We\u2019re apparently taking up \u201cabout five dozen\u201d of the worst of the worst with us. Great, that means there are only 10,940 or so ISIS fighters who could break out during the upcoming fighting.\n\nBut apparently we don\u2019t have to worry about ISIS fighters escaping, because, President Trump declared, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be escaping to Europe. That\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\u201d I guess we\u2019re just cool with thousands of ISIS fighters running around Europe now.\n\nGee, it\u2019s a good thing no Americans live in Europe.\n\nADDENDA: On this week\u2019s The Editors podcast, Rich, Charlie, the soon-to-be-much-missed David French, and I discuss impeachment, the NBA, and Syria.", "description": "NBA teams are taking steps to stifle any expression of criticism against China by fans.", "authors": ["Jim Geraghty", "Victor Davis Hanson", "John Mccormack", "Rich Lowry", "Andrew C.
