On Sunday morning, CNN anchor Jake Tapper made sure his viewers remembered.\n\nIn the final moments of his State of the Union broadcast this week, Tapper said that the White House\u2019s outright refusal to \u201cparticipate\u201d in the House impeachment inquiry means that the president is \u201cseemingly thumbing his nose at the very notion that the U.S. government was designed with three co-equal branches, specifically to offer checks and balances on each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen President Obama was in the White House, the Republican-led House of Representatives conducted lots of oversight,\u201d Tapper continued, \u201con the Fast and Furious scandal, on the Benghazi tragedy and more.\u201d He said that anyone who covered or followed the Benghazi saga \u201cmay find it stunning to see Republican members of Congress trash-talking whistleblowers and inspectors general and trash-talking the oversight responsibilities of the House.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter all, during the Obama years, in the trenches, pushing to conduct oversight were many of these same House Republicans,\u201d Tapper said, \u201csuch as then Congressman Mike Pompeo from Kansas.\u201d After playing a clip of Pompeo extolling the constitutional necessity of oversight, Tapper added, \u201cYes it is!\u201d In response to him saying it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d for the Obama administration to ignore subpoenas, Tapper said, \u201cIt is unacceptable!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne has to wonder what that congressman would make of the secretary of state, who has the same name, whose department is ordering State Department officials to ignore congressional subpoenas,\u201d Tapper said, before moving onto Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who also reportedly urged Donald Trump Jr. to do the same.\n\nThat is a \u201cfar cry,\u201d Tapper said, from what Graham had to say when he was tasked with prosecuting the impeachment case against Bill Clinton. \u201cThe day that Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is the day that he was subject to impeachment,\u201d Graham said at the time.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, during the Clinton impeachment, Rudy Giuliani made it very clear where he stood on the matter of avoiding subpoenas,\u201d Tapper said, revealing another clip from 1998 of Trump\u2019s personal lawyer telling Charlie Rose that \u201cthe president is not above the law, is not able to avoid subpoenas.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that Giuliani is enmeshed in the Ukraine scandal, however, Giuliani hasn\u2019t even made it clear whether he is going to honor the congressional subpoena aimed at him,\u201d Tapper added. \u201cThe arguments that Democratic presidents needed to comply with congressional oversight were correct. That\u2019s how the system was set up.\u201d\n\nTapper concluded, \u201cIf you only apply constitutional standards to the other political party and not to your own, then those aren\u2019t principles, they\u2019re tactics.\u201d\n\nRachel Maddow Predicts Senate GOP May Just Find Its \u2018Conscience\u2019 and Impeach Trump\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
