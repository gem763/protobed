But on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported that two former officials said it stemmed from Trump making a \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader. On Thursday, The Post reported that two people familiar with the matter specified that the complaint was focused on Ukraine, bringing the focus back to Trump\u2019s July call with Zelensky.\n\nTrump pressed Ukrainian leader to investigate Biden\u2019s son, according to people familiar with the matter\n\nTrump denied any wrongdoing in a series of tweets following The Post reports. And speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump refused to say whether he mentioned the Biden family in his July phone call with Zelensky. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d he said, referring to the conversation as \u201ca beautiful conversation.\"\n\nHe also said that when he speaks with world leaders, his conversations are \u201calways appropriate \u2026 at the highest level, always appropriate.\"\n\nDemocrats had already launched an investigation into that call over concerns that Trump and his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, are attempting to coerce the Ukrainian government into helping Trump win reelection next year. Democrats have said they believed Trump sought information linked to Joe Biden\u2019s positions on Ukraine that could then be used to damage his presidential campaign.\n\nWhile serving as vice president, Biden took a hard line against Ukrainian corruption. On a 2016 trip to Kiev, when Biden was still in office, he encouraged Ukrainian officials to dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, and threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loans if they didn\u2019t follow through.\n\nA number of other western countries also took the position that the prosecutor needed to step down, citing serious allegations he had failed to crack down on corruption.\n\nBiden\u2019s son, Hunter, was serving on the board of a Ukrainian-owned gas company at the time, raising suspicions in some circles that the elder Biden was trying to ensure the prosecutor, who was probing the company, didn\u2019t complete his investigation.\n\nUkrainian lawmakers did vote the prosecutor out but no evidence has surfaced that Biden\u2019s stance was influenced by his son\u2019s work.\n\nIn May, Giuliani canceled a planned trip to Ukraine, during which he acknowledged he planned to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating the Biden family\u2019s ties to Ukraine. \u201cThey say I was meddling in the election \u2014 ridiculous \u2014 but that\u2019s their spin,\u201d Giuliani said of Democrats at the time.\n\nIn a heated interview on CNN Thursday night, Giuliani insisted Biden behaved improperly, then contradicted some of his own statements over whether he asked Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens. On Friday, Trump said someone \u201cought to look into\u201d Biden.\n\nZelensky, who founded the multimillion-dollar production company Studio Kvartal 95, brought business experience and media savvy to his new role as president \u2014 but not much else. Still, on the campaign trail he vowed to fix some of Ukraine\u2019s most stubborn problems, like deeply entrenched corruption and the five-year long conflict with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has killed at least 13,000 people.\n\nHe also promised to keep Ukraine on a path toward joining the European Union and said he would want any decision to join NATO to be voted upon through a national referendum.\n\nHis pledges were enough to help him oust the incumbent, Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire who made his fortune in the confectionery business. During a debate against Poroshenko, Zelensky, himself a wealthy celebrity, said he is \u201cjust a simple person who came to break the system.\u201d\n\nIn his first speech after taking office in May, Zelensky, in a move reminiscent of his humble TV character, urged Ukrainians against idolizing him by hanging his photo in their offices.\u201c Hang photos of your children there, and before every decision, look them in the eye,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also called for lawmakers to remove a number of high-level officials, including the defense minister, the prosecutor general and head of security services.\n\n\u201cSo that our heroes don\u2019t die anymore, I\u2019m ready to do anything,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to lose my ratings, my popularity, my post for peace to come \u2014 without losing our territories.\u201d\n\nHis political party, named for his TV series, then managed to elect 254 lawmakers in a snap general election this summer. Like Zelensky, all of them were political newcomers: Not a single one had ever served in parliament before, and the party organized a special boot camp for them to learn the ins and out after the election.\n\nIt was after that election that Trump called to congratulate him, his office said at the time, in the same phone call that now finds itself at the center of a major standoff in Washington.\n\nRead more:\n\nHe played Ukraine\u2019s president on TV.
