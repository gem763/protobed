(AP) - Arizona rallied from a season-opening loss by scoring quickly and building an insurmountable halftime lead.\n\nThe Wildcats let down in the second half and had too many penalties to be satisfied completely with the win, particularly with the schedule about to get a whole lot harder.\n\nGary Brightwell ran for 141 yards and a touchdown on five carries, Khalil Tate accounted for three scores and Arizona bounced back from a disappointing opening loss by routing Northern Arizona 65-41 on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy about the win, but there\u2019s a lot of things that I\u2019m not very happy about,\u201d Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. \u201cI addressed that in the locker room and we\u2019re going to continue to address that.\u201d\n\nArizona (1-1) had an extra week off to think about its opening loss to Hawaii.\n\nThe Wildcats took it out on the Lumberjacks (1-1) early, scoring on touchdowns on their first seven drives and racking up 517 yards while setting a school record for points in a half for a 51-13 halftime lead.\n\nArizona finished 720 total yards, 431 rushing. Brightwell scored on a 94-yard run, Darrius Smith scored twice, and J.J. Taylor ran for 102 yards and a touchdown.\n\nTate hit 13 of 15 passes for 142 yards and threw two touchdowns to Tayvian Cunningham before being replaced by Grant Gunnell with 7:56 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe second half was a different story. Arizona\u2019s offense stalled, the defense gave up some big plays and the penalties piled up - not what they want with a prolific Texas Tech team coming to the desert next week.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t satisfied for sure,\u201d said Tate, who threw two passes in the third quarter before sitting for good. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play collectively as well as we should have.\u201d\n\nComing off an opening win against Missouri State, Northern Arizona had a few good offensive moments against Arizona, but dug too a deep of an early hole to ever have much of a chance.\n\nCase Cookus threw for 373 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for the Lumberjacks.\n\n\u201cEvery play, even when you win, you\u2019ve got to take something away,\u201d Cookus said. \u201cI made a lot of mistakes, there\u2019s guys across the board who made mistakes and they\u2019re a good football team, going to win a lot of football games.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s onslaught started from the opening drive, when Tate hit Cunningham on a 47-yard score. Next series, Taylor broke free for a 49-yard run, then scored on a 25-yard burst up the middle.\n\nBrightwell made it 21-0 midway through the first quarter, making one defender miss and racing past the rest on a 94-yard touchdown run, tied for second-longest in school history.\n\nTate went in untouched on a 1-yard run , then found Cunningham for a second time, on an 8-yard TD pass before heading to the bench.\n\nGunnell stepped in and threw TD passes on his first two collegiate drives, hitting Drew Dixon on a 9-yarder and Thomas Reid III on a 75-yarder.\n\nGunnell added a 1-yard TD pass to Smith in the fourth quarter to put Arizona up 65-27 and finished 9 of 11 for 151 yards.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nNorthern Arizona never stood much of a chance against the bigger, faster Wildcats, but the experience could help once the Big South season hits.\n\nArizona bounced back nicely from the Hawaii loss with a dominating performance, even if it was against an FCS opponent.\n\nCASE\u2019S RETURN\n\nCookus was limited to two games in 2018 due to a broken collarbone and could have left NAU as a graduate transfer, but opted to return as a fifth-year senior. His return was a huge boon to the Lumberjacks and he\u2019s had a solid start to the 2019 season.\n\nCookus made some superb throws while completing 28 of 48 passes against Arizona after throwing for 290 yards and two scores against Missouri State last week.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s worked his tail off to get back from his injury,\u201d NAU first-year coach Chris Ball said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great leader, he\u2019s extremely smart, has a great arm, he\u2019s tough, probably the most competitive guy I\u2019ve been around.\u201d\n\nPILES OF PENALTIES\n\nSumlin was not pleased with the defense in the second half, but was more concerned with the penalties. Arizona had 11 penalties for 127 yards, many on personal fouls.\n\n\u201cToo many selfish penalties, things we\u2019re not going to tolerate,\u201d Sumlin said. \u201cThe penalties we had today are not OK. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about us and some of those penalties were about you.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNorthern Arizona hosts Western New Mexico next Saturday.\n\nArizona hosts Texas Tech next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona rallied from a season-opening loss by scoring quickly and building an insurmountable halftime lead.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/08/n_arizona_arizona_football_81121_c0-116-2778-1735_s1770x1032.jpg?1f967f1629b2933cdfccb2484464f44f90cdac25", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
