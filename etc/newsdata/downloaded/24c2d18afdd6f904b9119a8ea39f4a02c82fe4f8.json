Al Franken (D-MN), who quit in disgrace amid accusations of sexual misconduct. The accusations against Franken, which came from eight women, included groping and unwanted kisses.\n\nGillibrand pulled out of the 2020 race late Wednesday, making her the first senator and the first woman to exit. She said early on that her campaign would center on fighting for policy solutions to problems that predominantly affect women and their economic and social equality.\n\nNow, in an online message announcing the end of her campaign, she signaled that she will continue to fight those battles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTogether we\u2019ve taken on the fights that others wouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ve led the fights that we can\u2019t afford to lose for women and families and moved the entire field along with us,\u201d Gillibrand says in the video message.\n\n\u201cWe have put the civil rights of women front and center and never backed down when it comes to valuing them \u2026 bringing issues like paid family leave from the back burner to the presidential debate stage.\u201d\n\nGillibrand championed national parental paid leave that would allow any worker three months away from the job to adjust to parenthood, to care for an ailing family member or because of their own illness. She also made reproductive rights a major focus of her campaign.\n\nDuring the second presidential debate, she challenged former Vice President Joe Biden about an op-ed he wrote in the 1980s that opposed a tax credit for assisting families with child-care costs. In it, Biden had mentioned \u201cthe deterioration of the family.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the first presidential debate in June, Gillibrand focused on abortion access and said, \u201cThirty states are trying to overturn Roe v. Wade right now and it is mind boggling to me that we are debating this at this stage in 2019 among Democrats whether women should have access to reproductive rights. I think we have to stop playing defense and start playing offense.\u201d\n\nGillibrand also paid close attention to LGBTQ rights by releasing an in-depth plan to fight for policies that would improve LGBTQ people\u2019s lives, such as prohibiting conversion therapy, improving health-care access for trans people, recognizing nonbinary people in identity documents, and reversing some of President Donald Trump\u2019s rollbacks of Obama-era protections. She also spoke with the National Center for Transgender Equality to discuss her agenda for advancing transgender people\u2019s rights.\n\nEMILY\u2019S List, a PAC that works to elect pro-choice Democratic female candidates, tweeted, \u201cThank you @SenGillibrand for being a fierce champion for women and families.\u201d\n\nThank you @SenGillibrand for being a fierce champion for women and families. You elevated reproductive freedom, LGBTQ rights, paid leave, and so much more. We look forward to the work you'll continue to do in the Senate. https://t.co/dNe8vO6i0a \u2014 EMILY's List (@emilyslist) August 28, 2019\n\nBut Gillibrand\u2019s campaign was also marked by the controversy around her decision to lead the calls for Franken to resign in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Politico article that came out in the fall of last year cited prominent donors across the country who said they would not donate or raise money for her because, they said, she was \u201cduplicitous\u201d and generally untrustworthy. The piece also noted \u201cdonors\u2019 fondness for Franken.\u201d\n\nTina Dupuy, one of the women who said Franken groped her while posing for a photo in 2009, wrote for The Atlantic, \u201cWe posed for the shot. He immediately put his hand on my waist, grabbing a handful of flesh. I froze. Then he squeezed. At least twice \u2026 It shrunk me. It\u2019s like I was no longer a person, only ornamental. It said, \u2018You don\u2019t matter\u2014and I do.'\u201d\n\nIn November, before he resigned, Franken said, \u201cI feel terribly that I\u2019ve made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again.\u201d\n\nFranken has said the allegations were false and called for an independent investigation. In an interview with the New Yorker in July, he said he now regrets his decision to resign.\n\nBut dozens of senators called for his resignation. Even the top Democrat in the chamber, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) pressured him to quit, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBut in the months that followed, outrage in the public and from his peers softened against Franken, in keeping with a wider societal phenomenon of men shunned early in the #MeToo era gradually being rehabilitated.\n\nIt did not help matters for Gillibrand that the New Yorker published an article last month revisiting the allegations.\n\nThe piece, which focused on the first allegation by a conservative talk-radio host who starred with Franken in a U.S.O. show in 2006, Leeann Tweeden, quoted various senators who said they regretted having called for his resignation. These included Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Angus King (I-ME), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Tom Udall (D-NM), as well as former Sens. Heidi Keitkamp (D-ND) and Bill Nelson (D-FL).\n\nAlso quoted was former Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who said of Franken, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible what happened to him. It was unfair.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible Gillibrand would have exited the race early even without so many prominent Democrats and donors casting Franken as a victim, or even if critics hadn\u2019t seemed eager to blame her in some part for his downfall.\n\nBut advocates for women\u2019s equality say that the entire controversy almost certainly cast a shadow on her campaign. During her run, Gillibrand was frequently asked about the allegations and her decision in interviews. A campaign aide told the Huffington Post she was asked about Franken at least 24 times this year.\n\nDuring an interview with Washington Post Live this month, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t defend unwanted groping and forcible kissing, and I decided that I had to say I couldn\u2019t support it anymore and I couldn\u2019t support him.\u201d\n\nToni Van Pelt, president of the National Organization for Women, told ThinkProgress about the end of Gillibrand\u2019s campaign, \u201cSenator Kristen Gillibrand has never been afraid to speak out, and her outspoken feminism made her a target during her presidential campaign. Kristen Gillibrand should have been given the time to talk about the issues that matter to women and families instead of being constantly asked about Al Franken. The system continues to be rigged against women who challenge the patriarchy, but we need more candidates like Kristen Gillibrand to take up the challenge, and win the race.\u201d\n\nProminent political thinkers and advisers said it goes almost without saying that her call for Franken to resign unfairly tarnished her campaign.\n\n\u201cGillibrand was blamed for Al Franken\u2019s sabotage of his own career, and the ensuing misogynist resentment of her tanked her campaign,\u201d Moira Donegan, A columnist for The Guardian, tweeted.\n\nLauren Rankin, a writer and clinic escort said following her exit, \u201cShe is not responsible for his bad behavior, and blaming her for it is loathsome.\u201d\n\nAnd I\u2019ll say this: if you resent Gillibrand for Al Franken\u2019s necessary departure from the Senate, you are not a progressive and you need to re-evaluate some shit. She is not responsible for his bad behavior, and blaming her for it is loathsome. \u2014 Lauren Rankin (@laurenarankin) August 28, 2019\n\nPeter Daou, a political adviser and author of Digital Civil War: Confronting the Far-Right Menace, tweeted \u201cIt is absolutely wrong how she was singled out for blame.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gillibrand.jpg?w=1920&h=1080&crop=1"}
