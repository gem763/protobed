It is a cause of real concern that they are also more likely to drop out of university once they get there.\n\n\u201cDrop-out rates are overall low in England, so this is a small effect. But we are not talking about one or two students \u2013 this is a couple of hundred students per year who have made a significant investment of time and money in a degree from which they are unlikely to benefit.\u201d\n\nSome unconditional offers are necessary, Ms Dandridge said, but \u201cmany are not\u201d.\n\n\u201cAlthough it is up to universities to decide who to admit and how, they must take responsibility for the impact of those decisions, and provide the right support for all students to be successful \u2013 especially if the offer they receive makes them less likely to do well at school.\n\n\u201cAs our regulatory framework sets out, admissions systems must be reliable, fair and inclusive.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing here are admissions systems that are not fair, and are not working in students\u2019 best interests.\u201d\n\nASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said the excessive use of unconditional offers is not in the best interests of students (Jason Senior/ASCL/PA)\n\nGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: \u201cThis analysis provides further evidence that the excessive use of unconditional offers is not in the best interests of students.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about so-called \u2018conditional unconditional offers\u2019 where the offer is made on the condition that the student makes the university their first choice.\n\n\u201cThese offers encourage students to sign up for courses which are not necessarily the best choice for them and this is probably why they are then more likely to drop out.\n\n\u201cTo make matters worse, the use of these offers can also demotivate students when they are taking their A-levels and other post-16 qualifications leading them to do less well in these important qualifications.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage students to choose the university course which best suits their interests and ambitions, and we would urge universities to desist from the practice of making this type of offer.\u201d", "description": "The Office for Students has raised concerns that teenagers who accept unconditional university offers are more likely to drop out of degree courses.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/11/wire-20373036-1572436785-311_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
