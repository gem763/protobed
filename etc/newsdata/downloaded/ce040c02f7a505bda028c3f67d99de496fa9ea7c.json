Police issued a statement on Monday and said they were working to reunite the victims with their families.\n\nPolice arrested one man, 78-year-old Mallam Bello Abdullahi Umar, for running what they called an \u201cillegal detention/remand home.\u201d\n\nLawai Musa, a trader who lived near the centre, told Reuters by phone that families sent unruly men and boys there believing it was an Islamic teaching facility that would straighten them out and teach them Islamic beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe way he is treating the children is un-Islamic\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not happy, they were treated illegally.\u201d\n\nIslamic schools, known as Almajiris, are common across the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend them.\n\nIn June, President Buhari, himself a Muslim, said the government planned to ban the schools, but would not do so immediately. After the incident in Kaduna, the president issued a statement calling on traditional authorities to work with government to expose \u201cunwanted cultural practices that amount to the abuse of children.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s office declined to immediately comment on the Katsina raid, saying it would issue a statement after a full briefing from police.\n\n\u201cThe command enjoins parents to desist from taking their children/wards to illegal, unauthorized or unapproved remand/rehabilitation centres,\u201d the police statement said.\n\n(The story refiles to fix garbled names throughout)", "description": "Police in northern Nigeria rescued nearly 70 men and boys from a second purported Islamic school where they were shackled and subjected to \"inhuman and degrading treatments.\"", "authors": ["Ahmed Kingimi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440862056&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1U0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
