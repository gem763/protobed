Schumer, New York Democrat, tried to force a symbolic rebuke of Mr. Trump, saying it would send a signal that might make the president reverse his decisions and send U.S. troops back in, but that was blocked by Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican said not only has Congress never authorized going to war in Syria, but sending troops back would mean putting them in between Turkey and the Kurds, both U.S. allies but who are now battling each other.\n\nHe suggested another option: halting U.S arms sales to Turkey, which he said would be a serious blow, rather than a symbolic rebuke.\n\nThat was blocked by Sen. James Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, who told all sides to cool it and wait for his bill, which he said he\u2019s about to introduce to deal with all sides of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have a comprehensive piece of legislation,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Trump made a surprise decision last week to withdraw U.S. troops from their position in Syria, pulling them from the middle of a civil war where they were acting as a buffer between various sides, and also helping the Kurds combat Islamic State forces.\n\nThe president said he was elected to get the U.S. out of endless wars.\n\nHis critics say his move, which he conveyed to Turkey\u2019s government before announcing it publicly, amounted to a green light for Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 to invade to do battle with the Kurds, who have been fighting alongside U.S. forces, and have been holding Islamic State prisoners for the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe longer we wait, the more Kurds will die \u2014 our allies \u2014 the more ISIS prisoners will escape, and the greater danger, hour by hour, day by day, America falls in,\u201d Mr. Schumer said\n\nThe anti-Trump resolution he tried to pass had cleared the House on Wednesday in an overwhelming bipartisan vote.\n\nIt chastised the president for his decisions and urged him to come up with a new strategy.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday he wants something \u201cstronger,\u201d including blessing the deployment of U.S. troops in Syria.\n\nHe said it was curious the House resolution didn\u2019t include such language \u2014 and speculated it\u2019s because Democrats would be split over that policy.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
