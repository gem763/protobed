Today it goes by the Russian acronym RUDN.\n\nIn a hall of the grey, Soviet modernist main building, Russian and foreign students mingle as members of the Guinean society dance to traditional music.\n\n\u2013 Exporting Russian expertise \u2013\n\nFilippov says the university\u2019s aim is not simply to attract African students to Russia, but also to export Russian expertise to the continent and vice versa.\n\nOf RUDN\u2019s cooperation agreements with 49 African universities, more than 20 were inked in the last two years.\n\nIn addition, RUDN has established Russian language centres in Namibia and Zambia.\n\nThe rector acknowledged that this increased activity was tied up with Moscow\u2019s aim to develop its presence in some African nations.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s always a question of geopolitical interests and economics,\u201d Filippov said.\n\nThe university is meanwhile hoping that some of its Russian students will spend time in Africa after they graduate. At the end of this month, RUDN will host its first \u201cI Want to Work in Africa\u201d careers fair.\n\nThe Soviet Union maintained a strong presence in Africa as part of its ideological war with the West, backing liberation movements and sending tens of thousands of advisors to former colonies that had gained independence.\n\nTouting military cooperation, arms deals and investment, Russia is making a comeback on the continent and seeks to rival European countries and even China, analysts say.\n\nChimuka Singuwa, a 23-year-old Zambian who is working towards a master\u2019s degree in international relations and diplomacy at RUDN, said he had the opportunity to study in Russia or China.\n\n\u2013 Russia or China? \u2013\n\nHe chose Moscow on the advice of his grandfather, who was a student at RUDN in the 1970s.\n\nSinguwa said he had no regrets about passing up on a Chinese education.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of against the \u2018takeover\u2019 of Africa by the Chinese,\u201d he said, pointing to the debt Zambia has accumulated with China, its main investor.\n\nSinguwa will travel to the Russian resort town of Sochi to work as a volunteer at the Africa summit, which he described as a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d for the regions to develop their relations.\n\nRUDN hit international headlines in 2003 with a dormitory fire that killed 43 foreign students. Arson was never ruled out, and witnesses and rights groups criticised what they said was a slow response to the blaze.\n\nAt the time, foreign students also told media of racially motivated attacks.\n\nBut Singuwa said he had encountered little racism in Moscow.\n\n\u201cIn some remote areas in Russia, where there\u2019s one foreigner, that\u2019s kind of difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nOusmane Setibaye Sou, a 25-year-old undergraduate from Chad, told AFP he had come to Moscow expecting racism but had not experienced any.\n\nHe said he would like to help develop cultural relations between Russia and his home country.\n\n\u201cThere are many people there who speak Russian,\u201d he said, adding that dozens of Chadians had been coming to Russia to study every year since the 1970s.\n\n\u201cEven our former prime minister (Yusuf Saleh Abbas) was a student\u201d at RUDN, he said.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 As the Kremlin seeks to boost ties with Africa, a Moscow university that was a training ground for the continent\u2019s elite during", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/369450_guinean-students-are-attending-peoples-friendship-university-russia-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
