I feel like I\u2019m pretty dangerous on third down. Hopefully, I am utilized that way. Whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAfter signing a four-year, $37.5 million deal this offseason, Tate was expected to be Eli Manning\u2019s top receiver. Now he\u2019ll likely still be the top pass-catcher on the Giants, but he\u2019ll have a new quarterback feeding him the ball.\n\nDaniel Jones and Golden Tate won\u2019t be a new pairing\n\nAlthough Tate may have expected to work with Manning, the Giants were smart enough to allow him to work with Jones during the preseason. When Manning sat out the final game against the New England Patriots, Jones completed two passes for 37 yards to Tate on the opening drive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m liking what I\u2019m seeing, for sure,\u201d Tate said of Jones. \u201cHe\u2019s been handling the moment very well and hopefully he continues to improve each day and each game. \u201cHe\u2019s slippery. He finds his way out of some sticky situations and makes plays. Obviously, he\u2019s helped us win. Watching from afar, his decision-making has been great, I think. I\u2019m here to help him, helping his development, help make some plays and take some pressure off of him and just help us continue to win.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nIn the first four games of the regular season, tight end Evan Engram has evolved into one of the league's top players at his position, but the rest of the receiving corps has been disappointing. Sterling Shepard has 20 receptions for 218 yards, but no other receiver has topped 105 yards.\n\nNow Jones could see his play-calling options widen with one of the top slot receivers in the league by his side. Tate leads the league in yards after the catch since 2010 thanks to game-breaking speed and elusiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to have Golden back,\u201d Jones said. \u201cLooking forward to it, and looking forward to what we can do.\u201d\n\nGiants wide receiver Golden Tate returns from a four-game suspension this week. (Fred Kfoury III/Getty Images)\n\nTate ready to hit the ground running\n\nTate practiced with the Giants all summer but has not been allowed to be with the team during his regular season suspension. That has meant watching Giants games on TV from his West Coast home and trying to keep up to speed from afar.\n\n\u201cI have trainers, massage therapists, and rehab people there,\u201d Tate said. \u201cI just went back home and worked my tail off, tried to stay ready and get better and hang with the family. I tried to keep myself busy just to take my mind off of it.\u201d\n\nTate has big shoes to fill as he effectively replaces the since-traded Odell Beckham Jr., but first he\u2019s just ready to prove that he\u2019s in game-shape. With a few less hits taken compared to the rest of the offense, perhaps he can be the spark the team needs to continue a playoff run.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Golden Tate returns from a four-game suspension for a performance-enhancing drug", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FX03O_FAc.f1D_a7iWD7aA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTYuNTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lxmvLB2iW5k.i.qC4SG8sQ--~B/aD0yNjEwO3c9MzkwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/f98586c0-e3c9-11e9-9b7f-32cde1f8fa4c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
