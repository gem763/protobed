But the district reneged on its decision Wednesday, announcing in a statement at 4 p.m. that Persky had been let go.\n\nRECALLED CALIFORNIA JUDGE ASKS FOR HELP TO PAY LEGAL DEBT\n\n\"We believe this outcome is in the best interest of our students and school community. The District will begin the search for a new coach immediately with the goal of ensuring that the athletes on the JV tennis team are able to have a successful season. Both the Lynbrook and District staff will be supporting the team and their families throughout this transition,\" the statement said.\n\nIn response to his dismissal, Perksy released his own statement that said Superintendent Polly Bove told him \u201cshe was motivated by a desire to protect the players from the potentially intrusive media attention related to my hiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough I am disappointed with the district\u2019s decision, it was a privilege to coach the team, if only for a short time,\u201d the statement continued, according to the Mercury News of San Jose. \u201cI wish all of the players the best in their future academic and athletic endeavors.\u201d\n\nRachel Zlotziver, the district\u2019s communications coordinator, said Persky applied for the coaching position over the summer and completed all of the district\u2019s hiring requirements, including a fingerprint background check.\n\n\u201cHe was a highly qualified applicant, having attended several tennis coaching clinics for youth and holds a high rating from the United States Tennis Association,\u201d she added, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nLynbrook High School held a meeting Monday with the parents of JV and varsity girls\u2019 tennis teams in response to the community\u2019s concerns over Persky\u2019s employment.\n\nIn 2016, Persky sentenced Turner to six months behind bars after a jury found the then 18-year-old college sophomore guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated, unconscious woman outside an on-campus fraternity party. Two Swedish graduate students found Turner on top of the woman\u2019s half-naked body near a dumpster.\n\nThe former judge ignored the prosecutors\u2019 recommendation of a seven-year sentence, prompting critics to launch a recall effort in mid-2016 in what is considered one of the first tests of the #MeToo movement's political strength. Turner was released early on good behavior after just three months and was required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.\n\nMore than 60 percent of Santa Clara County voters who went to the polls voted to recall Persky in June 2018. He is only the fifth judge in California history to be removed from office before serving his full term and the first to be ousted in 86 years, the Mercury News reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe case garnered national attention when BuzzFeed published the victim\u2019s 7,000-word emotional account of the attack and its aftermath, which she read in court during Turner\u2019s sentencing hearing. The statement eventually was read on the floor of the U.S. Capitol during a congressional session.\n\nThe woman who Turner sexually assaulted, previously identified in court documents under the pseudonym \u201cEmily Doe,\u201d revealed her name last week: Chanel Miller. She is scheduled to release a memoir titled \u201cKnow My Name,\u201d on Sept. 24.", "description": "Aaron Persky, the former California judge who was ousted by voters in 2018 after receiving harsh backlash over his handling of former Stanford University swimmer and convicted sex offender Brock Turner\u2019s sexual assault trial, lost his new job as a public high school tennis coach Wednesday, school officials said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/12/a0e19110-Judge1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
