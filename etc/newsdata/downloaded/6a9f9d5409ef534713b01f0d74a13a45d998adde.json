He was 27.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of Patrick\u2019s family, team, and those closest to him, we are grateful for the prayers, expressions of support and outpouring of love for Pat that have been so obvious since his injury,\u201d promoter Lou DiBella said in a statement. \u201cHe was a son, brother, and good friend to many. Pat\u2019s kindness, positivity, and generosity of spirit made a lasting impression with everyone he met.\u201d\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s 10-round fight against undefeated Charles Conwell, a 2016 U.S. Olympian, Day was knocked down in the fourth and eighth rounds. In the final round, Conwell knocked him out with two rights and a left hook.\n\nWhen Day landed, the back of his head slammed onto the canvas. Referee Celestino Ruiz immediately stopped the bout without a count.\n\nMedical personnel surrounded Day, and he was taken out of the ring on a stretcher to an ambulance. The 27-year-old fighter never regained consciousness and later underwent emergency brain surgery.\n\nTwo days before Day\u2019s death, Conwell penned an emotional letter to him on social media.\n\n\u201cI never meant for this to happen to you,\u201d Conwell wrote on Instagram. \u201cAll I ever wanted to do was win. If I could take it all back I would. No one deserves for this to happen to them. I replay the fight over and over in my head thinking what if this never happened and why did it happen to you.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop thinking about it myself. I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn\u2019t even imagine how my family and friends would feel. I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you.\u201d\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nDon\u2019t forget to download the DAZN app @dazn_usa and tune in this Saturday evening #DAZN #DibellaEntertainment #MatchroomBoxing #PressConference\n\nA post shared by Patrick Day (@patday_allday) on Oct 10, 2019 at 6:54pm PDT\n\nDay (17-4-1, 6 KOs) entered the fight after losing a 10-round decision to junior middleweight contender Carlos Adames in late June. Before the back-to-back defeats, Day won six consecutive fights dating to 2015 and was a decorated amateur.\n\nDiBella said he hopes Day\u2019s death will lead to a solution on the dangers of boxing.\n\n\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\u201d DiBella said. \u201cThis is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 16 (UPI) \u2014 Junior middleweight boxer Patrick Day, who endured a 10th-round knockout defeat Saturday night, died from a traumatic brain injury", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
