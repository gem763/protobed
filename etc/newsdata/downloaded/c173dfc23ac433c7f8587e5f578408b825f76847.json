Many die from heart attacks or strokes, triggered by sustained exposure to low indoor temperatures (18c or less), which makes their blood vessels constrict as the body tries to preserve its core temperature of around 36c to 37c.\n\nThis means the heart has to pump harder to force blood through narrowed blood vessels, driving up blood pressure and increasing the chances of death in those with existing heart problems.\n\nBut what has been less clear is whether simply popping out without a coat, or with wet hair, during cold weather puts healthy people at risk.\n\nFor many years, the rise in cold and flu instances during winter has been almost entirely attributed to the fact that we spend more time indoors in each other\u2019s company \u2014 giving viruses more opportunity to spread between us.\n\nNow, while experts think this \u2018crowding\u2019 plays a part, a much bigger factor is the effect a sudden drop in air temperature has on the body\u2019s ability to fight off invading viruses.\n\nA landmark study at Yale University, in the U.S., found that rhinoviruses \u2014 which cause the common cold \u2014 reproduce much more effectively when temperatures in the nasal cavity suddenly drop (in this case to around 33c from the usual body temperature of 37c).\n\nThis drop in temperature occurs in extremities such as the nose, when going from a warm house to the cold outside.\n\nThe 2015 study on mice revealed that viruses flourish at lower temperatures partly because the body\u2019s immune system is less able to produce the proteins needed to destroy the invading organisms when conditions are cooler.\n\nDrop in temperature occurs in extremities such as the nose, when going from a warm house to the cold outside\n\nIn the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, the researchers wrote: \u2018In general, the lower the temperature, the lower the immune response to viruses.\u2019\n\nIn other words, the \u2018old wives\u2019 tale\u2019 about wrapping up warm \u2014 particularly around the head \u2014 to avoid illness may have been right all along.\n\n\u2018We know that when people spend more time indoors together, bugs spread,\u2019 says Professor Ron Eccles, from the Common Cold Centre at Cardiff University. \u2018But I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the only reason for the increase in winter illness.\n\n\u2018Cold air makes the blood vessels throughout the body, including the hundreds of tiny vessels in the nasal cavity, constrict. This reduces the amount of blood \u2014 which delivers the infection-fighting immune cells \u2014 flowing into the area.\n\n\u2018This could be another reason why going out in the cold puts you more at risk, assuming you are actually carrying the cold virus already.\u2019 Standing still in the cold will increase the risk further, he adds.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s worse if you are stationary as you are not generating body heat, which keeps the blood vessels dilated and the nasal temperature higher.\u2019\n\nA drop in temperature also slows down movement of the cilia, tiny hair-like cells in the nasal cavity which transport mucus, and the bacteria and viruses it traps, out of the nose.\n\nViruses and bacteria thrive in this moist environment and, if they are not quickly \u2018moved along\u2019 by the swaying of the cilia, they can gain a foothold and cause an infection.\n\nProfessor Eccles believes there is a good reason for the age-old advice about wrapping up, as our ancestors were much more exposed to the elements than we are today as they travelled by foot or horse and would have been acutely aware of the affect cold weather could have on their health.\n\nHe advises: \u2018Cover your nose and mouth loosely when going into the cold, especially if you are prone to asthma or chest infections. This warms the air as it\u2019s inhaled.\u2019\n\nProfessor Ian Pavord, a specialist in respiratory medicine at Oxford University, says cold air exposure is a common trigger for wheezing and breathlessness in people with asthma due to something called hyperresponsiveness. Put simply, their lungs are much more sensitive to a sudden change in temperature than a healthy person\u2019s airways.\n\n\u2018Scandinavian people deal with the cold a lot better than we do, by always wearing warm clothes, especially woolly hats, because the body loses most of its heat through the head,\u2019 says Professor Pavord.\n\nGoing out with wet hair in winter is \u2018a complete no-no\u2019, he warns, as the head loses heat rapidly. The body also starts to lose heat, which makes the head even colder, and the brain reduces blood supply to any part of the body not considered essential, such as the nose, so it can maintain the temperature of vital organs.\n\nIt has also been found to trigger painful sinuses, as well as posterior eye pain \u2014 a type of headache involving a sharp, temporary pain behind the eye.\n\nA study in the journal Medical Hypotheses in 2012 revealed that this is all to do with the brain\u2019s automatic thermal regulation system, designed to protect the brain against extreme heat or cold.\n\nExperts from the GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital in Istanbul found that the double whammy of wet hair and freezing conditions causes blood vessels in the skull to dilate, triggering a rush of warm blood through the tiny blood vessels in the head, which can result in severe, sharp pain.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all bad news. In fact, popping outside for an hour or two on a cold day could potentially help protect against type 2 diabetes.\n\nA 2017 study at Maastricht University in the Netherlands found that frequently moving from hot to cold speeds up the body\u2019s metabolism \u2014 the rate at which it burns calories \u2014 and improves sensitivity to the hormone insulin by more than 40 per cent.\n\nIf the body becomes less sensitive to insulin, or if it produces less of the hormone, this can lead to a build-up of glucose in the bloodstream and type 2 diabetes.\n\nIn tests, the scientists found that sudden exposure to colder temperatures for ten days in a row had as powerful an effect on patients with type 2 diabetes as some commonly used medicines.\n\nChanging Traits\n\nHow our bodies have changed over time. This week: The vanishing arm muscle\n\nPut your arm on the table palm face up. Touch your thumb to your little finger and flex your wrist. Can you see a band rising in your wrist? If so, you are one of the 80 per cent or so of the population who still has the palmaris longus muscle, which runs from the arm to the wrist. Don\u2019t fret if you don\u2019t have it, as it has no obvious purpose: it\u2019s thought to have become largely redundant since humans developed opposable thumbs. In fact, surgeons often graft this muscle elsewhere in the body following disease or trauma.\n\nQuite why some people still have the muscle is a mystery: \u2018I suspect it\u2019s because there was no evolutionary imperative to get rid of them,\u2019 says Dr Michael Berthaume, a bioengineering research associate at Imperial College London.\n\nStoring up trouble\n\nThe way you handle food can have effects for health. This week: Buy green tea in small packets\n\nIf you\u2019re an infrequent green tea drinker, you could find the healthy compounds for which you buy it have dramatically declined by the time you brew up.\n\nAdvised to buy small packs of green tea and keep them in an airtight tin. And use bottled water rather than tap to make your tea, as other research showed this doubled the epigallocatechin gallate content\n\nA study in the Journal of Food Science found that levels of epigallocatechin gallate, the main antioxidant, which is thought to reduce inflammation and prevent cell damage that leads to disease, declined by 28 per cent within six months; other antioxidants fell by as much as 51 per cent.\n\nBuy small packs and keep them in an airtight tin.
