I guess it\u2019s a publicity stunt,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\n\u201cThey have no credibility,\u201d he told White House reporters.\n\nThough Mr. Trump has struggled to get his approval ratings above water, he enjoys extensive support within the Republican Party.\n\nMr. Trump said he can\u2019t blame the four states that have scrapped their GOP primaries already. He said the contests would be a waste of money.\n\nEyeing his foes, Mr. Trump said former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld\u2019s vice presidential bid in 2016 never got off the ground, and that former Rep. Joe Walsh couldn\u2019t win a second term in the House.\n\nHe reserved special criticism for former Rep. Mark Sanford, who jumped into the race Sunday but is dogged by an extramarital affair he had in 2009, while serving as South Carolina\u2019s governor.\n\nThe governor told aides at the time that he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, even though he\u2019d gone to South America to meet his mistress.\n\n\u201cMr. Tallahassee Trail or Appalachian Trail \u2014 he\u2019s the Appalachian Trail, right?\u201d Mr. Trump said, repeating a verbal mistake that made headlines in 2018. \u201cThe Tallahassee Trail is nice, too, but I think it was the Appalachian Trail.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t on the Appalachian Trail, he was in Argentina,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
