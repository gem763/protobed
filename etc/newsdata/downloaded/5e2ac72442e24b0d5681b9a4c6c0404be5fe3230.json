Yes, it's even harder to get into Stanford's elite business program than Harvard's, Yale's, Columbia's, and Wharton's. And a recent survey by Bloomberg Businessweek sent to MBA grads rating 126 business schools around the world based on their \"alumni network, reputation, academic quality, entrepreneurship, and innovation\" found that Stanford scored highest in four out of the five questions.\n\n\"It is very competitive and the bar to stand out is even higher,\" said Benjamin Fernandes, a Stanford GSB alumnus and the founder and CEO of NALA. \"Every year, more and more people apply, and the school is always looking for the best class to bring in.\"\n\n\"To me, the biggest challenge was that it was just daunting, with such a low acceptance rate and so many qualified applicants,\" said Nicole Alvino, the cofounder and chief strategy officer of SocialChorus and a 2004 Stanford GSB graduate.\n\nNicole Alvino. Courtesy of Nicole Alvino\n\nStanford GSB's exceedingly slim 6.1% acceptance rate \u2014 for perspective, around 20% of applicants get into Yale's and Wharton's business programs \u2014 means that any edge you can give yourself in this ultracompetitive field can make a difference.\n\nTo that end, Business Insider asked six Stanford business school grads \u2014 as well as the assistant dean of MBA admissions and financial aid at Stanford's Graduate School of Business \u2014 for their insights on how to get noticed and tapped by Stanford GBS's extremely selective admissions committee. Here's their top advice.\n\nDon't imitate what you think the admissions committee wants to see\n\nWhile the stereotype of the ideal Ivy League candidate is someone who fulfills the traditional version of achievement (with legacy to boot), Stanford alumni highlight the importance of bringing your own distinct A game to your application. Ian Cinnamon, a Stanford GSB alumnus and the president and founder of the Silicon Valley-based Synapse Technology Corp., noticed that his GSB classmates were all \"incredibly unique,\" which provides some insight into what the admissions-committee values. \"Everyone really focused their applications not just on their accomplishments, but their unique motivations that drove them,\" Cinnamon said.\n\nAs a result, his top advice for Stanford business school applicants is to be uniquely you \u2014 not an imitation of a type. \"Don't try to fit into an unnatural mold. Be true to yourself; be true to what drives you,\" Cinnamon said. \"Whether you want to be a journalist, a singer, or a rodeo bull rider, there is no passion that is too 'outside the box' for the GSB. Even classmates who came from similar backgrounds (consulting or finance) each had their own passions and drives that they pursued during the GSB.\"\n\nIan Cinnamon. Courtesy of Ian Cinnamon.\n\nOther Stanford business school alumni validated this advice with their own messages. \"Tell a story that only you can tell, and avoid writing answers that you think the administration is looking for,\" Samantha Dong, the founder and CEO of Ally Shoes, said. \"Authenticity is one of the most important lessons we learned at the GSB. Honestly, people can tell the difference. It's truly one of the greatest gifts to be surrounded by people with a passion for something meaningful, and the drive and capacity to make change happen. If you believe you are one of those people, show it with your story and your unique voice.\"\n\n\"Please don't try to 'model' your application after someone else you know who got in,\" Irina Farooq, chief product officer of Kinetica, said. \"You are not that person, and this approach will inevitably impact your ability to articulate your unique experiences and points of view. The best you can do is to stay true to yourself and your aspirations.\" Fernandes added: \"Be honest about your journey and where you want to go. Finally, be humble, you are not perfect, don't feel the need to show this. Admissions officers have read thousands of essays each year and could spot something being embellished from a mile away.\"\n\nMake sure your entire application tells a cohesive story\n\nNo guide for getting into business school \u2014 much less a top-tier institution like Stanford \u2014 would be complete without mentioning strategic approaches to the essay component of the application. Fernandes focused his tips for getting into the competitive program around how you approach the business-school essay. \"Truly reflect on the essay question, 'What matters to you most and why?'\" Fernandes said. \"It's a deep question for anyone to ask themselves; it's almost like asking yourself, what is your life's purpose?\"\n\nSamantha Dong. Courtesy of Samantha Dong\n\nDong agreed that the \"What matters most to you and why?\" essay question is \"notoriously daunting,\" adding that she found answering this question to be the single biggest challenge of getting into the GSB. To overcome this formidable obstacle, she wrote 20 different drafts before finalizing her essay. \"Ultimately, two things helped me put things in perspective,\" Dong said. \"I wrote down all the meaningful, big moments in my life and tried looking for common threads. I also asked myself this question: What's the one thing in life I cannot live without?\"\n\nFernandes emphasized ensuring that your entire application tells a similar story that delivers a coherent, compelling message throughout. \"Your story makes you stand out, but it wouldn't make any sense if one talks about wanting to use technology to transform the football industry and nothing else in your application talking about your passion for football and technology,\" he said.\n\nDistinguish yourself in a jam-packed field\n\nSal Hazday, the chief operating officer of OppLoans, said he had to be persistent to succeed in his goal to earn a Stanford MBA. \"I sent in additional recommendations and my own self-recommendation on what made me a different type of candidate,\" Hazday said. The reason behind these extra efforts was what Hazday found to be the biggest challenge in getting into Stanford GSB: \"Knowing that I had to compete not just with smart people who went to prestigious schools, received good grades, and had successful careers prior to business school, but also they did amazing and interesting things in other areas like athletics, research, or volunteer work.\"\n\nTo help tip the balance and compete in this arena, Hazday encourages candidates to diversify their work experience, like he did: \"I had the opportunity to work abroad in very different countries (Saudi Arabia, Costa Rica) as a SAP consultant \u2014 it provided a unique foundation to further build my knowledge in solving business challenges globally.\"\n\nRead more: Here's exactly what it takes to get accepted into Harvard Business School, according to 5 grads and the managing director of admissions\n\nExpress your unique form of leadership\n\nWhen Farooq first became interested in applying to Stanford's business school, she discovered that the biggest challenge was trying to figure out what she \"needed\" to do to get in. \"At the time, I didn't know a single person who had gone there, but it seemed like everyone around me had heard of 'ideal' strategies to get in,\" Farooq said. \"At first, it made the GSB seem like this mythical place for which I had to completely stretch and change myself to get in. That was extremely unsettling.\"\n\nIrina Farooq. Courtesy of Irina Farooq\n\nFarooq was ultimately able to hurdle this challenge by realizing the first point in the list of strategies above \u2014 as she explained it: \"Stanford actually wants you to bring your unique self to the table.\" With this new perspective, Farooq focused not on stressing the outcome but on giving the admissions committee an accurate picture of herself, her goals, and her aspirations. Her route to finding her authentic voice came by tapping into her unique form of leadership and expressing that in her application.\n\n\"It's a small class of around 360 people, so they are looking for every single person to demonstrate how they can be a future leader,\" Farooq said. \"But they also deeply understand that leadership comes in many different forms and are looking for people from different backgrounds. In fact, a big part of the program is structured around honing your leadership skills, where you get challenged by different perspectives.\" Pointing out that Stanford GSB's motto is \"Change Lives, Change Organizations, Change the World,\" Farooq finds it no surprise that its admissions essays are geared toward understanding you as a person and your potential as a future leader. \"I used this as an opportunity to really introspect my own goals and motivations and then articulate those in my essays,\" she said.\n\nReview Stanford GSB's evaluation criteria\n\nIn addition to considering the advice of successful Stanford MBAs about how they got into the program, be sure to heed the following words of Kirsten Moss, the assistant dean of MBA admissions and financial aid at Stanford's Graduate School of Business: \"We're looking to build a diverse class of students who are curious and willing to tackle issues or challenges, which go beyond what may be expected of them,\" Moss said. \"We look for students who have taken initiative, focused on results, engaged others in their efforts, and helped others grow.\"\n\nTo understand exactly what the admissions committee is looking for, Moss points interested applicants toward reviewing the MBA program's evaluation criteria, emphasizing that its students bring a variety of perspectives and experiences to the classroom and community. \"We really mean it when we say we don't expect our students to all fit one mold,\" Moss said. \"So the best advice I can give is for candidates to be honest and authentically yourself.\"\n\nRead more: The ultimate guide to nailing a sales pitch that closes the deal every time\n\nMake sure you really want it\n\nBenjamin Fernandes. Courtesy of Benjamin Fernandes\n\nFarooq takes a lot of calls from people applying to business schools, many of whom she says don't know why they are doing it. \"The most common answer I get is, 'I was told it will look good on my resume.' Yes, it may, but so will a number of other things.\"\n\nBased on this experience, Farooq advises applicants to do some soul-searching before applying. \"Really spend time understanding yourself \u2014 what motivates you, what you are trying to achieve by going to business school,\" she said. \"The admissions team can always distinguish between people who see business school as a key part of their leadership journey and those who are just jumping on the bandwagon.\"\n\nFernandes concurs that motivation, as well as the timing of when you decide to apply to Stanford's business school, can play a big factor in the outcome \u2014 not because one application window is better than another, but because it's important to apply only when you have a firm grasp on your true motivations. \"I think a reason why many people don't get in is maybe because they apply when they aren't ready yet,\" Fernandes said. \"You really have to ask yourself why you want an MBA \u2014 and why now?\"\n\nThis story originally published on August 7, 2019.", "description": "Stanford Graduate School of Business has the lowest admission rate of 2019.
