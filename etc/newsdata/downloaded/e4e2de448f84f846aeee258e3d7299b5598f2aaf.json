A cat in South China is currently on a glucose drip after it mated with AT LEAST five females in a single night.\n\nMr and Mrs Zhao left their cat, Xiaopi, the Russian Blue, at a hotel in Guangdong Province in South China. Mr Zhao had reportedly specifically informed the pet staff that his cat was not neutered.\n\nHe reportedly wrote on social media: 'I thought they'd be professional, but the staff member didn't feed Xiaopi during the day and let him out to roam freely at night. That's right, all the cats were free to walk around the shop and then the employee went home\u2019.\n\nAsiawire\n\nHe also wrote how he found out about the late night shenanigans of his cat, 'Between around 10:40 pm and 5:00 am, my cat mated with five female cats. And those are only the ones I could see in the CCTV footage'.\n\nDon't Miss 12 K SHARES 12.7 K SHARES 5.6 K SHARES 5.4 K SHARES 2.7 K SHARES\n\nWell, that\u2019s some stamina his cat's got there!\n\nMr Zhao claimed that the hotel staff then blamed him for the doings of his cat and complained that not all the other cat owners were keen on having kittens. 'They had the nerve to be upset with me. They wanted me to explain the situation to all the other owners. My f***ing cat is exhausted and on a glucose drip, and this is my fault?', he reportedly wrote.\n\nAsiawire\n\nHe further added 'They're going to compensate each pregnant cat's owner 500 Renminbi (approx Rs 5,000), and have promised to sell any kittens on their behalf'.\n\n'The other owners have also told me they'll either give me a kitten or 1,000 Renminbi (approx Rs 10,000) if their cats turn out to be pregnant\u2019.\n\nSo, not only, did his cat get to have a fun night, but Mr. Zhao will be compensated for all the fun his cat had? It sounds like a win win to me.", "description": "Cats do not appear to be very active animals, however this news might change your view of that.
