Bye Anne, love you bye\u2026 Oh gosh, I said\u2026 why did I say \u2018love you\u2019? That\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026 err it was a gaffe.\n\nAn audibly-embarrassed Vine tried to move on but when he got through to the next caller, Jamie from Huddersfield, they immediately brought up the gaffe.\n\nThe following conversation ensued...\n\nJamie: \u201cJeremy, how\u2019s it going? I think you just made that lady's day then.\u201d\n\nVine: \u201cI\u2026 it just came out, but I mean\u2026 I guess it\u2019s true\u2026\u201d\n\nJamie: \u201cI think she was very pleased to talk to you anyway.\u201d\n\nVine: \u201cOkay, don\u2019t worry, I won't say I love you at the end of this call. You\u2019re a builder\u2026\u201d\n\nJamie: \u201cNot to me pal, not to me.\u201d\n\nVine: \u201cNo, that would be\u2026 illegal.\u201d\n\nWhen the clip was shared on social media, some people sympathised with the presenter and remembered when they had accidentally done the same thing.\n\nWho hasn\u2019t accidentally called the teacher \u201cmum\u201d or \u201cdad\u201d before?\n\nInstead of ignoring the mistake, Vine could simply make it part of his show from now on instead.\n\nHe\u2019s already walked back his suggestion that he shouldn\u2019t say \u201clove you\u201d to a builder.", "description": "BBC presenter Jeremy Vine accidentally said \u201cI love you\u201d to a caller on his radio show this afternoon.", "authors": ["Conrad Duncan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/13/16/jeremy-vine-radio.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
