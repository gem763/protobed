She was let go from her TODAY Show post roughly two years later.\n\nMelissa Lonner, a former entertainment booker-turned-producer for the network, revealed to Curry in 2010 that Lauer had exposed himself to her in an office after a work event at NBC\u2019s 30 Rockefeller Center headquarters, Farrow reported in his book, which was released Tuesday.\n\nWhen she brushed him off with a laugh, Lauer allegedly said he \u201cknew that she wanted it,\u201d Farrow wrote, according to Page Six. At the time, Lauer allegedly commented about how he \u201cfigured she liked it dirty,\u201d before growing angry and calling Lonner \u201ca f------ tease\u201d who \u201cled me on,\u201d Farrow reported.\n\nWhen Lonner later approached Curry about the encounter, it \"was as close as you could get to a woman just melting in front of you in pain,\u201d Farrow said Curry told him.\n\n\u201cShe told me that complaints about Lauer verbally harassing women in the office were well known in her day \u2014 and that once, in 2010, a colleague had pulled her into an empty office and broken down, saying Lauer had exposed himself and propositioned her,\u201d Farrow wrote about his conversation with Lauer\u2019s former co-host.\n\nCurry left the Today Show in 2012 with a tearful on-air goodbye in which she thanked viewers and apologized. She continued working for the network until 2015, Page Six reported at the time.\n\n\u201cFor all of you who saw me as a groundbreaker, I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t carry the ball to the finish line,\u201d she said during the emotional January 2012 goodbye. \u201cBut man, I did try.\u201d\n\nNBC claimed at the time that Curry was let go because ratings were down, according to a Fox News report.\n\nBut in 2018, Curry revealed on \"CBS This Morning\" that \"verbal sexual harassment was pervasive\" at the network.\n\n\"I can tell you that I am not surprised by the allegations,\u201d Curry said during the segment, referring to accusations made against Lauer. She later added: \"I would be surprised if many women did not understand that there was a climate of verbal harassment that existed.\"\n\nWhen the identity of another Lauer accuser, Brooke Nevils, was released earlier this month, Curry tweeted her support for the former NBC staffer, and noted: \u201cI believe she is telling the truth.\u201d\n\nA representative for Curry did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\n\u201cAnn and Matt never made up after her firing,\" a network insider told Page Six at the time. \"He believes the way she handled it made him look terrible, while she believes Matt played a major role in her downfall.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, NBC President Noah Oppenheim once again vehemently denied claims made in Farrow's book and provided the network's comments on Lonner's claims and Curry's involvement, according to a staff-wide memo released by Oppenheim Monday and obtained by FOX Business.\n\nFox Business has included the portion of the memo related to Curry. The description was provided as one of three items in a list of examples \"that Farrow alleges are Lauer-related before 2017.\" See below:\n\n\"A woman who is named in the book. Farrow says she disclosed her allegation to Ann Curry in 2010, and asked her not to share it. Curry says she then told two executives \u2014 both of whom are no longer with the company \u2014 that Lauer 'had a problem with women.' By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer\u2019s 'problem' regarded any specific workplace misconduct. NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this. At the time of the employee\u2019s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer, was paid 22 weeks of severance based on her years of service, and was asked to sign a separation agreement that was standard for departing employees at the time. The standard separation agreement included a routine confidentiality clause that was designed to protect proprietary company information. It was not drafted to prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, and it has never been used that way. (This employee made a complaint to management about Lauer, for the first time, after his 2017 firing.)\"\n\nA representative for NBC did not respond to a question pertaining to the circumstances of Curry's firing.", "description": "Melissa Lonner, a former NBC staffer, revealed to Curry in 2010 that Lauer had exposed himself to her in an office following a work event.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Matt-Lauer-and-Ann-Curry-2012.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
