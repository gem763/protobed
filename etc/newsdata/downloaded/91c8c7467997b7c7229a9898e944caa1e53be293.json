Michael McKinley, a former senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told members of Congress on Wednesday that he resigned last week because the Trump administration had taken foreign policy away from career officials at the State Department.\n\nLast Friday, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was removed from her post in May, told impeachment investigators that she was forced by the Trump administration to step down based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nTrump has forcefully denied any wrongdoing, defending his conduct and calling the impeachment inquiry politically motivated.\n\n\u201cYou would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the Democratic presidential debate that took place the night before. \u201cNow you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!\n\n\u2018We are in quite uncharted territory\u2019\n\nRice accused Trump of exploiting U.S. relationships with foreign countries to advance his personal political interests.\n\n\u201cI don't see what conclusion rational people can draw, other than that the president has put a for-sale sign on the Oval Office,\u201d says Rice, who also served as Ambassador to the United Nations in the Obama administration. \u201cWe are in quite uncharted territory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he is selling is anything that would get him what he thinks would be politically beneficial to him, maybe also financially beneficial, although that's less clear,\u201d Rice adds.\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry last month after reports that on a July phone call Trump had pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. In subsequent days, the Trump administration released a rough transcript of the call and a whistleblower complaint filed in its aftermath.\n\nRice served as the National Security Advisor under president Barack Obama for three and a half years, giving intelligence briefings to the president each morning; and before that, she spent Obama\u2019s first term as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Earlier in her career, Rice served as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, and spent several years as a fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nShe currently sits on the boards of Netflix and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nFormer National Security Advisor Susan Rice appears on Influencers with Andy Serwer. More\n\n\u2018Biggest blunder of his presidency\u2019\n\nShe made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nBesides the impeachment inquiry, Trump\u2019s foreign policy has come under scrutiny for his decision last Saturday to withdraw 1,000 troops from Northern Syria, which was followed by a Turkish military offensive in the region. The move garnered criticism from some of Trump\u2019s staunchest Congressional allies, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who called it \u201cthe biggest blunder of his presidency.\u201d\n\nRice said that Trump\u2019s track record on foreign policy should raise questions about the motives behind the troop withdrawal.\n\n\u201cWhat made Donald Trump wake up, without consulting his national security team, and all of a sudden declare that U.S. forces are pulling out?\u201d she says.\n\nMax Zahn is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
