A player sitting out a playoff game so he could be present for such a special day was apparently outrageous to an always vocal segment of the sports world.\n\nAmong that group was former Marlins president David Samson, who decreed that Hudson could only miss the game if there was something wrong with his wife or newborn daughter.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUnreal that Daniel Hudson is on paternity list and missing game 1 of #NLCS . Only excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother. If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter? #waittosee \u2014 David P. Samson (@DavidPSamson) October 11, 2019\n\nChattanooga Times Free Press columnist and ESPN 105.1 FM radio host Jay Greeson also got in on the criticism as the game reached the late innings, saying that Hudson should have just been happy with photos of the occasion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNats closer Daniel Hudson's decision now comes into play. Hudson skipped Game 1 for baby No. 3 and we all hope momma and baby are healthy. But if you're making $5.5 mil a year and your team needs you to close in the NLCS, well, I'd say go get 'em mom and get photos. Thoughts? \u2014 jay greeson (@jgreesontfp) October 12, 2019\n\nBoth bad tweets were hit with a torrent of angry replies, more than 5,000 in total as of Saturday night.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nationals ended up not needing Hudson on Friday thanks to a combined one-hitter from An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez and Sean Doolittle. Hudson then returned to the team in time for Game 2, where he got the save with outs against Paul Goldschmidt and Marcell Ozuna.\n\nAfter the game, the always outspoken Doolittle, who also appeared in Game 2, had a very succinct way to describe the people who had a problem with Hudson\u2019s decision.\n\n\"If your reaction to someone having a baby is anything other than, 'Congratulations, I hope everybody's healthy!' you're an a**hole.\" -- Sean Doolittle on Daniel Hudson's paternity leave \u2014 Jared Diamond (@jareddiamond) October 12, 2019\n\nThat may as well be the final word on a very ridiculous controversy.\n\nBefore the game, Hudson addressed the matter as well in less profane, but still entertaining terms:\n\nHudson on the reaction to everything: \u201cI went from not having a job on March 21 to being part of a national conversation on family values. Life comes at you fast.\u201d \u2014 Mark Zuckerman (@MarkZuckerman) October 12, 2019\n\nNone of the Nationals have indicated they had a problem with Hudson, including the team\u2019s manager.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Hey, family's always first.\u2019 I understand,\u201d Dave Martinez said before Game 1.\n\nDaniel Hudson wanted to spend the first day of his daughter's life with her. Some found that outrageous. (Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images)\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Daniel Hudson missed Game 1 after his wife gave birth.
