Let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will try to honor you by playing with that same verve for the rest of this World Cup.\u201d\n\nIt has long been the Wallaby way to use the ball in hand, sometimes to the detriment of the higher-percentage but more conservative tactical kicking game. Sometimes it works _ Australia has won two Rugby World Cup titles and reached the final in \u201903 (under Eddie Jones) and in 2015 (under Cheika) _ and sometimes it backfires.\n\nAfter two slow starts requiring big second-half comebacks so far in Japan, Cheika is insisting this week that the kind of mistakes that resulted in Australia conceding significant leads to Fiji and Wales will be erased.\n\n\u201cIf you look at it in a bit of detail, we\u2019ve given away four tries so far in the two games _ an intercept (against Wales), a dropped ball against Fiji where they ran in behind us off a set-piece to run 50 meters, a wide kick and we missed a couple of tackles on the Fijians in game one,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cSo there\u2019s maybe a couple of concentration things there that cost us.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ve also created opportunities. If you watch the two games, we\u2019ve created opportunities at the start of the game, we maybe haven\u2019t taken those opportunities at the start, whereas in the back 60 minutes or 50 minutes of games we have. Sometimes that\u2019s just the nature of it.\u201d\n\nSelection consistency is a secondary consideration against Uruguay, with Cheika making 13 changes to his starting XV in a bid to give the full squad game time.\n\nIt continues the uncertainty over the key No. 10 role, with Christian Leali\u2019ifano recalled after Bernard Foley and Matt Toomua had a half each against the Welsh, with vastly different success. Leali\u2019ifano will reunite in the halves with Nic White in the partnership that started in the opening win over Fiji. The backup 9s have had a big impact off the bench in both games, a role Will Genia and White have shared.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve only got the two halfbacks here, so the division of time is also very important,\u201d Cheika said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get one player to dominate seven games in a row.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of both of theirs and, at the moment, we\u2019re happy with how they\u2019re both going.\u201d\n\nThe back row combination of regular opensides Michael Hooper and David Pocock playing in tandem will be shelved against Uruguay, with Lukhan Salakaia-Loto deployed as a more traditional blindside flanker and Jack Dempsey getting a start at No. 8. Hooper will play his third straight game as captain.\n\n\u201cAs a team, we are after a fast start, it\u2019s something we want to work on,\u201d Dempsey said, underscoring Cheika\u2019s theme, \u201cand, as a back-rower, that is something you can have a hand in, getting that quick start and getting a bit of a roll on.\u201d\n\nThe 19-year-old Jordan Petaia will make his test debut at the Rugby World Cup after getting picked on the wing.\n\nAustralia scored 11 tries in a 65-3 win over Uruguay in the last World Cup and, while the Uruguayans had an upset win over Fiji to open their campaign this time, there\u2019s no real expectation of another major shocker. Wales and Australia are expected to finish top and second in the group to advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nBrothers Agustin and Juan Diego Ormaechea will start together for the first time in the tournament after Uruguay made nine changes. Basically the same Uruguay lineup that upset Fiji 30-7 then lost to Georgia 33-7.\n\nFlyhalf Felipe Berchesi, who scored Uruguay\u2019s only points against Australia in \u201915, hooker German Kessler, lock Manuel Leindekar and backs Andres Vilaseca, Rodrigo Silva and Nicolas Freitas will make their third starts of the tournament.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nAustralia: Kurtley Beale, Dane Haylett-Petty, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Toomua, Jordan Petaia, Christian Leali\u2019ifano, Nic White; Jack Dempsey, Michael Hooper (captain), Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Adam Coleman, Rob Simmons, Allan Alaalatoa, Folau Fainga\u2019a, James Slipper.
