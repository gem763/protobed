The legislation would devote $90m a year over 10 years to evidence-based approaches to gun violence reduction.\n\nIn the past decade, as they have invested public dollars into expanding community-based strategies, Oakland has seen a 44% decrease in its gun homicide rate, and nearby Richmond has seen a 67% decrease in its gun homicide rate.\n\nRelated: Can Chicago's new mayor stop the bloodshed from gun violence?\n\nThe decreases in Oakland, Richmond, and San Francisco have driven a 30% decrease in the overall gun homicide rate across the greater San Francisco Bay Area, even as the number of people living in poverty in the region has increased, and as property crime has spiked in some areas. The decrease in the area is much larger than in the nation overall.\n\nThe successful local strategies highlighted in Booker\u2019s legislation include investing in street outreach workers or \u201cviolence interrupters\u201d, trusted community members who intervene in local gang conflicts to keep violence from spreading; funding intervention programs in hospitals to help shooting victims change their lives; and supporting \u201cgroup violence intervention\u201d strategies, such as Boston\u2019s Operation Ceasefire, that bring together law enforcement, community partners, and faith leaders to intervene with the small number of men in each city who are most likely to shoot or be shot.\n\nBooker\u2019s Break the Cycle of Violence Act is co-sponsored by the US representative Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat whose father was shot to death during a robbery when he was 19.\n\n\u201cThese deaths are preventable,\u201d Horsford said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Guns and lies in America: sign up for email updates\n\nMass shootings are usually the focus of America\u2019s gun control debate. But the majority of America\u2019s gun homicide victims are killed in smaller daily shootings in neighborhoods that have struggled with gun violence for decades.\n\nBlack men and boys, who make up just 6% of America\u2019s overall population, represent more than 50% of the country\u2019s gun homicide victims.\n\nA 2015 Guardian investigation found that half of the country\u2019s gun homicides were concentrated in just 127 cities and towns. Experts have argued for years that American gun violence is highly concentrated, and that one of the best ways to save lives is to devote more resources into the neighborhoods with the greatest need.\n\nBlack and brown activists have often felt \u201cinvisible\u201d and \u201cerased\u201d from the American gun control debate, McBride said.\n\n\u201cOur communities are used as props, but never really given serious consideration on how to scale up strategies that save our lives and heal our communities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new legislation focuses resources on the majority of America\u2019s gun violence victims \u2013 and it also focuses on solutions that are less politically controversial than gun control laws, McBride said.\n\n\u201cWe think Republicans, historically, have been huge supporters of these kinds of strategies, because of the role that faith communities and redemption and healing play,\u201d he said.", "description": "New bill would focus federal dollars on public health approaches to gun violence Senator Cory Booker gives a speech on gun violence at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, known as Mother Emanuel, in Charleston, South Carolina, in August.
