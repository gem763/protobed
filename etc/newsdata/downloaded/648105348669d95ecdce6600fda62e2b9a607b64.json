This began after Trump retweeted a pastor saying impeachment would cause a \u201ccivil war-like fracture in this Nation.\u201d Never mind that it was a retweet, and never mind that the original statement used \u201clike\u201d to make a comparison. The next headline was set: Trump Threatens Civil War If He\u2019s Impeached. Newsweek quoted a Harvard Law professor saying that the \u201cthreat\u201d alone made Trump impeachable. Another headline asked: \u201cIf Trump\u2019s Rage Brings Civil War, Where Will the Military Stand?\u201d\n\nBlowing up some online nonsense into a declaration of war tracks with the meme that Trump will refuse to leave office if defeated in 2020, or will declare himself the winner even if he loses, sending coded messages to armed minions. \u201cTrump Is Going to Burn Down Everything and Everyone,\u201d reads the headline from a NASDAQ-listed media outlet. \u201cBefore Trump will allow himself to be chased from the temple, he\u2019ll bring it down,\u201d wrote The New York Times.\n\nThat\u2019s just what the MSM is saying; it gets worse the further off the road you drive. \u201cTrump is going to try everything, Fox is going to try everything, and they\u2019re going to both further the injuring of societal reality and inspire dangerous individuals to kill and maim,\u201d Jared Yates Sexton, a well-known academic, tweeted on September 28. \u201cThere\u2019s a vast number of people in this, people who have been taught their whole lives that they might need to kill in case of a coup or corrupt takeover,\u201d he continued. \u201cTrump and Republicans signal to them constantly. They\u2019re more than ready to see this as the occasion.\u201d\n\nThe idea that Americans are steps away from squaring off across the field at Gettysburg is something that should only exist in satire. It would be hilarious, except that such fantasizing is influencing the actual future of our country. We have crossed a line where rationality is in the rearview mirror.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of us have lost track of the constitutional crises that have never actually happened since the first one was declared, over the non-issue of Trump losing the popular vote in 2016. What was it last week? Sharpiegate? Or the hotel in Scotland? Or an impeding war with Iran/North Korea/China? Or treason? Or something about security clearances? The Kurds were a thing in 2017 and again now. Paul Krugman of the New York Times first declared that Trump was going to destroy the economy in 2016, and has written the same article regularly ever since, most recently just last week. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that none of these things have actually proven to be true. Learned people are saying them again and again.\n\nThose who oppose Trump have convinced themselves they must impeach for something, and if all of Russiagate (remember that? It\u2019s like Aunt Edna\u2019s brief failed marriage, only not mentioned at the dinner table) wasn\u2019t enough, then Democrats will impeach over a phone call to a minor world leader.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. The fantasy was to use Robert Mueller\u2019s summer testimony about Trump being a literal Russian asset to stir up the masses\u2014Mueller Time, Baby! Congress would go home for August recess to be bombarded by cries for impeachment, and then autumn would feature hearings and revelations amplified by the Blue Check harpies leading up to, well, something big.\n\nWere rationality still in vogue, it would be hard to imagine that Democrats would consider the Ukraine call impeachable. But they closed out Russiagate like the OJ Simpson murder trial, certain Trump had gotten away with so much that they had to catch him at something else to make it even.\n\nDesperation makes for poor strategy. Think back just two weeks and no one had heard of any of this. Yet Dems and the media took America from zero to 100 nearly overnight as if this was another 9/11. With the winter caucuses approaching, Dems in search of a crime groped at something half slipped under the door and half bundled up by clever lawyers to be slipped under the door. Mueller was a lousy patsy so a better one needed to be found in the shallow end of the Deep State pool. It wasn\u2019t much but it was going to have to be made good enough.\n\nThe details will come out and they will stink. The first whistleblower had some sort of prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democrat. Given that he is a CIA analyst, that suggests a member of Vice President Biden\u2019s White House team, Cory Booker\u2019s Committee on Foreign Relations, or maybe Kamala Harris\u2019s Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nThe so-called second whistleblower appears to actually be one of the sources for the first whistleblower. That\u2019s a feedback loop, an old CIA trick where you create the appearance of a credible source by providing your own confirming source. It was tried with the Steele Dossier where the original text given to the FBI appeared to be backed up by leaks filtered through the media and John McCain\u2019s office.\n\nSo forget everything about this cooked-to-order crisis except the actual thing impeachment would turn on: the transcript of Trump\u2019s call. It does not matter what one, two, or 200 whistleblowers, former Obama officials, or talking heads \u201cthink\u201d about the call. There it is, the actual words, all pink and naked on the Internet for everyone to read. Ukraine did not investigate Biden. Trump did not withhold aid. The attorney general was not involved. DOJ ruled there was no violation of the law. It has little to do with Pompeo or Pence (though Pompeo was on the call). You and the Congress pretty much have it all in the transcript. It\u2019s bathroom reading, five pages.\n\nOnly a few months ago, the Democrats\u2019 drive to the White House began with the loftiest of ideals, albeit a hodgepodge from trans toilet \u201crights\u201d to a 100 percent makeover of the health care system. It is now all about vengeance, clumsy and grossly partisan at that, gussied up as \u201csaving democracy.\u201d Our media is dominated by angry Hillary refighting 2016 and \u201cjoking\u201d about running again, with Adam Schiff now the face of the party for 2020. The war of noble intentions has devolved into Pelosi\u2019s March to the Sea. Any chance for a Democratic candidate to reach into the dark waters and pull America to where she can draw breath again and heal has been lost.\n\nOkay, deep breath myself. A couple of times a week, I walk past the caf\u00e9 where Allen Ginsberg, the Beat poet, often wrote. His most famous poem, Howl, begins, \u201cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked.\u201d The walk is a good leveler, a reminder that madness (Trump Derangement in modern terminology) is not new in politics.\n\nBut Ginsberg wrote in a time when one could joke about coded messages\u2014before the Internet came into being to push tailored ticklers straight into people\u2019s brains. I\u2019ll take my relief in knowing that almost everything Trump and others write, on Twitter and in the Times, is designed simply to get attention and getting our attention today requires ever louder and crazier stuff. What will get us to look up anymore? Is that worth playing with fire over?\n\nIt is easy to lose one\u2019s sense of humor over all this. It is easy to end up like Ginsberg at the end of his poem, muttering to strangers at what a mess this had all become: \u201cReal holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell! They jumped off the roof! To solitude!\u201d But me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s funny at all.\n\nPeter Van Buren, a 24-year State Department veteran, is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People, Hooper\u2019s War: A Novel of WWII Japan, and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the #99 Percent.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/impeachment-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
