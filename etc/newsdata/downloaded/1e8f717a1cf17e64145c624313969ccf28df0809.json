They have to: If a guest gets into bed to find that the sheets are scratchy, or hot, or simply ill-fitting, the hotel is going to hear about it. \u201cA bed and its linens can make or break the whole hotel experience,\u201d says Alexandra Champalimaud, founder of Champalimaud Design, a firm whose projects include the Waldorf Astoria in Chengdu, Four Seasons Hotel in Jakarta, and newly restored Troutbeck country house in Dutchess County, New York. \u201cWhich is why, when we re-designed Troutbeck, we knew one of our main focuses was going to be on creating a particularly beautiful sleeping experience with crisp, smooth linens.\u201d\n\nIn order to determine what hotel insiders consider the best, most comfortable, and most durable (something hotel people know better than anyone \u2014 they wash their sheets daily, which means they learn quickly which pill and fray quickly and which maintain their integrity over time) sheets, we spoke to some 25 of them, from the interior designer of the Shinola Hotel in Detroit to the director of housekeeping at Texas\u2019s Camp Comfort. Two winners emerged quickly from the pack \u2014 one brand was recommended by six of our experts, the other by five. And for sheet lovers who have particular, nitpicky sheet preferences \u2014 linen fanatics, for instance, or those who will only deign to sleep on sateen \u2014 we asked our experts for the best of the best in those categories as well.\n\nThe Overall Best Sheets\n\nFrette Hotel Classic Sheet Set It will come as no surprise to anyone who frequents upscale hotels that Frette, a circa-1860 Italian company that has supplied linens to everyone from the Italian royal family to nearly every luxury hotel around the world (the Danieli in Venice, the Ritz in Paris, the Peninsula in Hong Kong), handily bested the competition. When Champalimaud was designing Troutbeck, she chose Frette because \u201ctheir quality is simply exquisite.\u201d Ave Bradley, SVP of design and creative director for Kimpton, collaborated with Frette to customize sheets for each of their 68 hotels. Rob Arthur, the general manager at the Ivy Hotel in Baltimore (which has a four-diamond rating from the AAA), sampled more than 50 types of sheets before deciding on Frette. Like Champalimaud, he was drawn to the brand\u2019s \u201cultra-luxurious fabric\u201d and \u201csimple yet chic\u201d designs. For Amy Finsilver, general manager of XV Beacon in Boston, Frette\u2019s durability was the deal sealer; the fabric, she says, \u201cremains smooth after many, many washes.\u201d While the products Frette supplies to its hospitality partners are not available for direct purchase, Frette\u2019s Hotel Classic Collection is. Christine Gachot, the interior designer of the buzzy Shinola Hotel in Detroit, actually prefers the direct-to-consumer version. \u201cThe super-crisp white percale sheets that you can buy through their website are just top, top quality,\u201d she says. Ron Gorodesky, managing director at the Reeds at Shelter Haven in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, who has used Frette bedding for years, says guests frequently request sheet-purchasing info before checkout. \u201cThey\u2019re as soft as a cloud, and our guests just love them,\u201d he says. $425 at Saks Fifth Avenue Buy $450 at Frette Buy\n\nA Dupe for the Overall Best Sheet\n\nGarnier-Thiebaut Nice Queen Sheet Set Mariano Galante, director of housekeeping at Sonnenalp Hotel in Vail, Colorado, was a Frette devotee for years. But eventually he discovered Garnier-Thiebaut. The 186-year-old French company made 100 percent cotton sheets \u2014 with a 320-thread-count percale \u2014 that didn\u2019t shrink or ever seem to lose their softness. And they did this at half the cost of a Frette set. He was sold. [Editor\u2019s note: there\u2019s actually a pretty solid selection of GT sheets on Amazon \u2014 click here \u2014 though inventory appears to be low. Their duvet covers are available on Wayfair.] $140 at Gracious Style Buy\n\nThe Second-Best Sheets\n\nComphy Sheet Set Other than Frette, the name that came up again and again was Comphy, a synthetic American brand originally designed for spas. \u201cNearly every guest comments how much they love our beds and bedding,\u201d says Kate Sheldon, co-owner of the Sheldon Chalet in Denali, Alaska. \u201cComphy\u2019s sheets have an ultra-luxurious touch and feel: In them, you\u2019re never too warm or too chilly. Plus, since they\u2019re ultra-light, they dry faster than cotton \u2014 and dry wrinkle-free.\u201d Lisa Kelleher, the co-owner of Camp Comfort in Comfort, Texas, uses Comphy as well \u2014 and frequently gets asked by guests where they can buy them for themselves. Kennley Selby, the director of design and owner of the Surf Hotel in Buena Vista, Colorado, likes Comphy so much that she uses their sheets in the hotel and at home, as does Matthew Carroll, the owner of Jail Hill Inn in Galena, Illinois (one of the highest-rated B&Bs in the country). \u201cThese sheets are easily the most talked-about amenity in my suites,\u201d he says. \u201cAlmost every morning at breakfast when I ask guests how their night was, their first comment is how soft and amazing the sheets are. I have been in the hospitality industry for over 18 years, and they are the best I have ever worked with. They are wrinkle resistant, they are durable against stains, and they look crisp and new every time we make a bed, which is very important when you\u2019re dealing with an upscale property.\u201d From $138 at Comphy Buy\n\nThe Best Linen Sheets\n\nMatteo Mica Linen Sheet Set \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with Matteo sheets since a stay-over in a friend\u2019s guest room several years ago,\u201d says Melanie Raines, director of design at New Waterloo, the hospitality management and development company behind Austin\u2019s South Congress Hotel. As soon as she got home, she upgraded her own sheets \u2014 and eventually incorporated the line into her work in hospitality. \u201cMatteo offers the loveliest fabrics, all made in a sort of \u2018slow-batch\u2019 manufacturing process in Los Angeles,\u201d says Raines. \u201cPrior to my switch, I had linen sheets from West Elm. They served me well but were in a different ballpark in terms of quality and detailing: Matteo\u2019s are soft but not worn-in, breathable, textured, and the right amount of refined without being slick.\u201d They are also, she says, the perfect hotel sheets. \u201cDurability in commercial washer/dryers is as important as feel and design when it comes to picking sheets for the rooms,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd to the surprise of the entire New Waterloo staff, Matteo bedding actually gets better with each wash, while still retaining its structure.\u201d $485 at Matteo Los Angeles Buy\n\nThe Best Eco-conscious Sheets\n\nRivolta Carmignani Classic Bedding Set Rivolta Carmignani are the sheets of choice at the Mokara Hotel & Spa in San Antonio \u2014 in part because they are certified STeP by OEKO-TEX. This makes them 100 percent ecofriendly, says Laura McKoy, creative director and vice-president of interior design for Omni Hotels & Resorts. Also, they\u2019re super-cozy. Says McKoy, \u201cThey\u2019re made of very high-quality Egyptian cotton, bleached, then mercerized, and hand-finished in a way that makes them feel really buttery.\u201d From $259 at Eric & Gustaf Buy\n\nThe Best Sateen Sheets\n\nKassatex 300-Thread-Count Sateen Sheet Set Another bargain pick with an Uber-luxe, high-end feel comes courtesy of Richard Fernandez, director of guest experience at EAST, Miami. He loves Kassatex\u2019s sateen sheets because they\u2019re made with 100 percent combed long staple cotton, a.k.a. \u201cthe most luxurious cotton in the world because of its softness, coolness to the touch, and durability.\u201d $100 at Kassatex Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
