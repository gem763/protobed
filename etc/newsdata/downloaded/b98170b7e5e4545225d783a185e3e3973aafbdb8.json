The Chiefs announced minutes later that Mahomes had a knee injury and wouldn\u2019t return.\n\n\u201cExcited for the win,\u201d Moore said after completing 10 of 19 passes for 117 yards. \u201cAt the same time, a guy like Patrick goes down it can be deflating.\u201d\n\nBefore he got hurt, Mahomes became the fastest player in NFL history to throw for 7,500 yards, in his 25th game.\n\n\u201cYou feel for anybody that has something that looks like it may be pretty serious,\u201d Broncos quarterback Joe Flacco said. \u201cThat\u2019s not just other quarterbacks; that\u2019s everybody. But man, a young guy like that who\u2019s starting off his career the way he has and starting off this season the way he has, it\u2019s definitely not easy to watch guys go down with injuries like that. I hope that he\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\nMahomes didn\u2019t speak with reporters after the game but he did lead the team\u2019s \u201cbreakdown\u201d after the game, when he praised Moore, who completed 10 of 19 passes for 117 yards, and the defense.\n\nThe Broncos had won two straight after a winless September and were hoping to turn the AFC West upside down by handling the Chiefs their third straight loss.\n\nComing in, the Chiefs were ranked 24th in the league with 11 sacks and they\u2019d allowed an average of 190 yards rushing over their previous four games.\n\nBut the Chiefs sacked Flacco a career-high eight times , drew three holding flags on grabby left tackle Garett Bolles, held Denver to 1-of-13 on third downs and benefited from Denver\u2019s poor special teams play and curious calls by coach Vic Fangio that backfired spectacularly.\n\nWhen Flacco did stay upright to deliver deep passes, they fell incomplete. Rookie tight end Noah Fant dropped three passes that would have totaled more than 100 yards.\n\nAt one point, Fox NFL analyst Troy Aikman exclaimed, \u201cThis is about as bad an offense as I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m shocked there\u2019s as many people still here at the game.\u201d\n\nThere weren\u2019t for very much longer as the fans streamed to the exits with the never-ending bungled plays by the Broncos, especially the porous O-line that was jeered by frustrated fans.\n\nThe Chiefs even sacked punter Colby Wadman, who had nowhere to throw the ball on a failed fake punt that gave Kansas City the ball at the Broncos 38 on the drive that ended with Mahomes\u2018 injury.\n\nAfter Mahomes got hurt, Moore couldn\u2019t get the Chiefs into the end zone on three plays from the 3, and Harrison Butker\u2019s 20-yard field goal gave KC a 13-6 lead.\n\nFlacco, who was sacked five times and knocked down eight more times in 15 first-half drop-backs, was sack-stripped by linebacker Anthony Hutchins on the next series and linebacker Reggie Ragland scooped up the loose ball at the 5 and rumbled into the end zone for a 20-6 halftime lead.\n\nBrandon McManus missed a 45-yard field goal that sailed well above the top of the right upright.\n\nThe Broncos scored first after getting a reprieve on a three-and-out when Frank Clark\u2019s face mask gave Denver a first down and Royce Freeman took it in from a yard out seven plays later. But Fangio decided to take the extra point off the board and go for 2 when Alex Okafor was whistled for encroachment.\n\nInstead of handing the ball off to Freeman again, Fangio had Phillip Lindsay, who\u2019s about 50 pounds lighter, pound the ball up the middle and he was stuffed, leaving the Chiefs celebrating instead and the crowd no longer buzzing.\n\nTheir 6-0 lead was short-lived as Mahomes somehow escaped the clutches of Von Miller and fired a pass that safety Will Parks tipped but Mecole Hardman reigned in anyway before avoiding sidestepping safety Kareem Jackson for a 21-yard score .\n\nHardman added a 37-yard punt return that led to a 33-yard field goal.\n\nINJURIES: Parks left the game with a hand injury and didn\u2019t return and Broncos rookie linebacker Justin Hollins left with a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nChiefs: Face the Green Bay Packers on Oct. 27.\n\nBroncos: Visit the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 27.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Reigning MVP Patrick Mahomes injured his right knee in a pileup near the goal line before his Kansas City teammates rallied around their fallen superstar for a 30-6 thrashing of Denver on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/chiefs_broncos_football_97231_c0-145-3473-2170_s1200x700.jpg?9f6b25a620b3e38ee6272850752dcb60c5266d55", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
