REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nThe company\u2019s remarks follow an earlier report by Bloomberg that said the United States is considering extending Chevron\u2019s waiver to operate in Venezuela with more limitations by granting the company a 90-day sanctions reprieve.\n\n\u201cWe are a positive presence in Venezuela, and we are hopeful that General License 8C is renewed so that we can continue operations in the country for the long-term,\u201d Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWe have dedicated investments and a large workforce who are dependent on our presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeneral License No 8C\u201d is the license that authorizes transactions in Venezuela involving PDVSA and entities it owns, according to the website of the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n\nChevron\u2019s future in Venezuela now depends on U.S. President Donald Trump, who must decide by Oct. 25 whether to renew the waiver allowing the company to keep operating in Venezuela despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe Treasury Department aims to further limit Venezuela\u2019s crude production and is concerned that Chevron\u2019s joint venture projects in Venezuela are providing financing to help Maduro\u2019s socialist government pay back its debt to Russian oil company Rosneft PJSC, Bloomberg reported on Friday. This could encourage more loans in the future.\n\nThe report added, however, that the United States also wants to maintain a presence in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry in case of a political transition.\n\nChevron has been present in Venezuela for nearly 100 years. It opened its Caracas office in 1923, and first struck oil at the Boscan field in 1946.\n\nThe Trump administration has several times imposed sanctions on Venezuela and sought to limit PDVSA\u2019s transactions to largely cut off Maduro\u2019s access to oil revenues, which account for most of the South American country\u2019s hard currency income.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment late on Friday.", "description": "U.S. oil major Chevron Corp said late on Friday it is optimistic about maintaining a presence in Venezuela even amid U.S. sanctions on the country and state oil company PDVSA as part of Washington's effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro.", "authors": ["Kanishka Singh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442539685&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I02X", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
