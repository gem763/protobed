He said his biggest challenge in the Johannesburg DA-led coalition was the DA itself.\n\nMashaba told journalists he could not reconcile himself with a DA that believed race was irrelevant in formulating its redress policies.\n\nHis resignation came a day after Helen Zille was elected to the powerful federal council chairperson position.", "description": "The Gauteng provincial Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs has again threatened to place the City of Johannesburg under administration if it fails to hold a council meeting.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9151/fc070512f6e94c1e982b4608aaf7ae9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
