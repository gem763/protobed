Special to the Register\n\nA former assistant football coach was arrested early Wednesday morning and charged with first-degree harassment following a weekend confrontation with a football official in West Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThe charge stems from a criminal investigation into the incident at Valley Stadium during which Lincoln High School (Des Moines) assistant coach Jason Storm, 44, of Des Moines, charged at a referee after a perceived missed call during Friday night's game against Dowling Catholic.\n\nStorm was riled up after a helmet-to-helmet collision between a Dowling defender and Lincoln quarterback Cayden Storm, who is the assistant coach's son, resulted in a \"no-call.\" The assistant coach, Storm, believed the collision to be intentional and claims his son suffered a concussion.\n\nNFL'S 100 WORST TEAMS OF ALL TIME: Could Dolphins, Redskins join most hopeless in history?\n\nTHE AWARD MLB NEEDS: Introducing the 'Jeter-Ortiz Cup'\n\nJason Storm, 44, of Des Moines. (Photo: Polk County Jail/Special to the Register)\n\nStorm left the sideline and approached the head official, stating that he was going to \"(expletive) kill him,\" according to court documents. Storm was restrained from attacking the head official by the coaching staff, and was escorted out of the stadium.\n\nThe incident was documented on video.\n\nThe official filed a police report with a police officer, according to a news release.\n\nCourt documents claim Storm admitted to being upset over the \"no-call,\" and apologized for his actions and disrupting the game. He resigned on Monday after coaching for about 15 years.\n\nStorm was booked into Polk County Jail early Wednesday and charged with first-degree harassment. A person convicted of the aggravated misdemeanor can be imprisoned for two years.\n\nHe appeared in court and was ordered released on his own recognizance; jail records showed that he had not yet been freed as of 9:30 a.m. He is scheduled to be arraigned Nov. 20.\n\nPhil Roeder, a Des Moines school spokesman, said there were mistakes made on both sides.\n\n\"There are two sides to the story, and neither one of them are particularly good,\" Roeder said. Storm \"recognized his mistake and owned up to it and stepped down. I hope the ref goes back and looks at the video and realizes he made a serious mistake, as well. There are missed calls in any sporting event, but missing something like that could have been a danger to both players.\"", "description": "Jason Storm was arrested Wednesday morning after threatening a referee at Friday night's game.", "authors": ["Andrea May Sahouri", "Published P.M.
