(TSX-V: VIS) (\u201cVisionstate\u201d or \u2018the Company\u201d) is pleased to announce updates on the Company\u2019s sales activities for its main operating division Visionstate IoT Inc., an Internet of Things (IoT) company specializing in solutions for the facility management industry.\n\n\n\nDuring the month of September 2019, the Company received orders for its WANDA product in new verticals, while existing customers continued to order additional units. WANDA, an IoT device designed to measure efficient restroom cleaning and customer satisfaction, was introduced to its first municipality last month. The 15-inch device, which collects data from sensors, customer alerts and staff cleaning activities, will be installed in large multiuse recreational centres located within the municipality.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of WANDA to our first major municipality is a key milestone for Visionstate,\u201d said CEO John Putters. \u201cWANDA lends well to the continued growth of smart cities, and therefore opens an entirely new sales vertical for the Company.\u201d\n\nIn the month of September, Visionstate also received orders from its first power authority located in the US. The installation will occur at their head office in November and represents another new vertical for the Company.\n\nThe diverse install base demonstrates the widening appeal for WANDA as more and more facility managers look to IoT solutions to make their work more efficient. WANDA acts as a hub for key cleaning, maintenance and customer satisfaction information that is summarized in an analytics dashboard. It measures traffic, supplies, cleaning activities and provides customers with the ability to issue alerts.\n\nExisting customers, including a Canadian hospital and a large shopping centre in Eastern Canada, purchased additional WANDA units during the month of September.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased to see existing customers order additional units,\u201d explained Putters. \u201cIt demonstrates the value of our product and the growing interest in IoT solutions. Once you switch to WANDA that provides accountability, efficiency, inventory tracking and real-time alerts, there is no way back to the traditional paper-based reporting. \u201d\n\nIndustry experts predict substantial investments into IoT solutions in upcoming years based on the value of the analytics it produces. Facility managers use that data to identify inefficiencies in operations, and can better respond to customer demands.\n\nAbout Visionstate Corp.\n\nVisionstate Corp. (TSX-V: VIS) is a growth-oriented company that invests in the research and development of promising new technology in the realm of the Internet of Things, big data and analytics, and sustainability.
