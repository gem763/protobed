And in this instance, they've been crossed.\"\n\nWeWork recently postponed an IPO and has been mulling slashing its valuation to lure investors, according to media reports. Its S-1 filing revealed details behind its wide losses and mounting pressure on founder Adam Neumann, who stepped down as CEO.\n\nArmstrong, speaking on the impact WeWork would have on other companies, said: \"Valuations overall will probably go down...and WeWork is gonna bleed into a lot of the other companies that have business models that are gross margin-negative.\"\n\nArmstrong said Peloton, for one, would take a hit. Peloton's stock began trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday, starting at $27 a share \u2014 nearly 7% lower than the $29 price set in the company's IPO \u2014 and closed down 11.2% to $25.76 a share.\n\n\"[WeWork] is going to have a bigger dent than people realize,\" he said. \"I think it [Peloton] gets out and I think, it goes up... slim chance... but if it does, I think it will repair some of the We stuff.\"\n\nRead More: Peloton boosted its marketing spend by 114% ahead of its IPO in its quest to win over a young, affluent audience\n\nArmstrong also said growing government scrutiny facing big tech companies including Facebook and Google, the rise of privacy laws, and increasing customer acquisition costs are hurting startups. DTC companies that are unable to show growth and a path to profitability will face tougher scrutiny. DTC founders need to understand their unit economics and explain how they plan to grow their customer bases, he said.\n\nHe said he was still bullish on DTC brands that are solving problems for customers but that only some were likely to succeed, such as Third Love that's taking on big incumbents like Victoria's Secret, as opposed to those in more crowded categories.\n\n\"You'll end up with hundreds of companies that have solved very specific issues,\" he said. \"And I'm sure there'll be giant roll-ups of DTC companies over time.\"", "description": "Armstrong predicted DTC companies and other IPO-hopefuls like Peloton would take a hit as a result of WeWork's troubles.", "authors": ["Tanya Dua"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d1f352e22af0c1070b512?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
