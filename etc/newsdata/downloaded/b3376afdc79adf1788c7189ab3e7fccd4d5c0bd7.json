She went on to say: \"I am not doing double standards anymore.\"\n\nShe went further, stating she was \"embarrassed at South Africans generalisations about 'whiteness'. We just love victimhood.\"\n\nResponding to Madonsela, Zille said \"whiteness\" was a swear-word used to \"stigmatise and marginalise\".\n\nZille then went on to tag Madonsela in a audio post, saying the larger Twitter audience and the former public protector would \"get a kick out of it\".", "description": "Outgoing Western Cape premier Helen Zille is choosing to stand by her \"black privilege\" tweets and has chosen not to apologise as suggested by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7740/928365a2c1dd4505b804c9073366d82a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
