This morning the White House issued a transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian president Voldymyr Zelensky. Now, Paul Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, has apparently threatened to resign unless he is allowed to testify as he deems fit before the House Intelligence Committee. He is scheduled to testify tomorrow morning.\n\nThe thirty-minute conversation is recorded on a redacted page of a five-page document, one which alerts readers that it \u201cis not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place.\u201d\n\nThe phone call took place four days after Zelensky\u2019s party won a majority in the Ukrainian parliamentary elections, and the purpose was ostensibly for Trump to offer his congratulations.\n\n\u201cI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it,\u201d says Trump. \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike . . . I guess you have one of your wealthy people . . . the server they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nThis is a reference to the origins of special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, which used information provided by the Ukrainian government. This information contributed to the prosecution of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. During the call, the president proceeds to mention the \u201cincompetent performance\u201d the elderly Mueller gave testifying before Congress. Today, at the United Nations, in a press briefing with Zelensky, Trump responded to a question about Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails by observing that he believes they may well be located in Ukraine.\n\nTrump alludes several times to Biden and the allegation that the former vice president worked to fire the former general prosecutor of Ukraine to prevent an investigation into his son\u2019s business dealings. \u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it . . . It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nZelensky assured Trump that there was a new general prosecutor getting appointed in September, who will be \u201c100% my person, my candidate.\u201d Reiterating that his goal is honesty in government and preventing corruption, Zelensky asks Trump to provide the Ukrainians with any information that may help the investigation. Trump says he\u2019ll have Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr contact him.\n\nThe president\u2019s domestic opponents aren\u2019t receiving the story as lightheartedly. CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza said the call \u201cis pretty darn close to a smoking gun.\u201d House Democrats are complaining that what was released isn\u2019t a real transcript but a partial summary and are still demanding to see the unaltered whistleblower complaint that started this whole thing.\n\nEven some Republican senators, members of the body that would likely acquit Trump after a probable impeachment by the Democratic House, are jumping ship before they even know it\u2019s sinking. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who two days ago Trump mocked for his defeat in the 2012 presidential election, said, \u201cClearly what we've seen from the transcript itself is deeply troubling.\u201d\n\nOne anonymous Republican senator, speaking to the Washington Post, called the release of the transcript a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d Mike Murphy, a former advisor to Romney and the late Sen. John McCain, informed MSNBC, \u201cOne Republican senator told me if it was a secret vote, thirty Republican senators would vote to impeach Trump.\u201d\n\nPlenty of Republicans are prepared to defend the president\u2019s conduct, however. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rand Paul (R-KY), who often give Trump opposing advice on foreign policy, both agree that he\u2019s in the right. \u201cWow. Impeachment over this? What a nothing (non-quid pro quo) burger,\u201d tweeted Graham. Paul responded that \u201cBiden is the one who threatened Ukraine\u2019s aid, not Trump, and that has to be investigated.\u201d The upcoming battle over Trump is likely to reveal as much about the Republican as the Democratic party.\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter at the National Interest.\n\nImage: Reuters\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The upcoming battle over Donald Trump is likely to reveal as much about the Republican as the Democratic party.", "authors": ["Hunter Derensis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KqW5gkHfwgAIWd.gY.Vkuw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/60b9d4e4d7d6da9e562e4bed69d68a69", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
