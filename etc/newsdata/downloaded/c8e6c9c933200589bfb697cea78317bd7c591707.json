The new data comes as the US-China trade dispute increasingly threatens the outlook in the largest economies and elsewhere.\n\nThe world economy will expand by 2.9% in 2019, the OECD projects, the weakest annual growth rate in a decade. Output could fall further in 2020 if the effects of tariffs worsen, the Paris-based organization said, or remain low at 3%.\n\n\"The global economy is facing increasingly serious headwinds and slow growth is becoming worryingly entrenched,\" said Laurence Boone, the chief economist at the OECD. \"The uncertainty provoked by the continuing trade tensions has been long-lasting, reducing activity worldwide and jeopardising our economic future.\"\n\nThe OECD also said that uncertainty surrounding Brexit had dimmed the outlook, warning that if the UK were to leave the European Union without a deal it could significantly chip away at output.\n\nThe US and China have slapped tariffs on thousands of each other's products and vowed to further expand those punitive measures in the coming months.

The central bank lowered interest rates in July and September, its first attempt to aid the economy since the financial crisis.\n\n\"Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on US investments and exports,\" Fed Chairman Jay Powell said Wednesday. \"Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Cell C's fair value cut to zero.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9385/414ed8ba1dcb4b3990726294e108f91e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
