Elizabeth Warren\u2019s rise in the polls in the Democratic presidential primary race has brought increased scrutiny of her past, including whether she was let go from a teaching job in 1971 for being pregnant. Warren has been telling the story for years. Now, some circles are questioning the veracity of her claims, and she is sticking by them.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Warren, like many politicians, often tells her personal story on the campaign trail, and has throughout her political career. Part of that story is an anecdote about her first teaching job as a speech pathologist for special-needs children in New Jersey. She was hired for the 1970-\u201971 school year by the Riverdale Board of Education of New Jersey but says she didn\u2019t get a job the following year because she was visibly pregnant with her daughter, Amelia.\n\nShe describes it as a pivotal moment in her life: After losing the teaching job, she would later go to law school and eventually land at Harvard, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and in the United States Senate.\n\nExcept some media outlets are claiming Warren\u2019s version of events isn\u2019t accurate. On Monday, the conservative website the Washington Free Beacon published a report it says counters Warren\u2019s claims. The outlet surfaced a copy of minutes from a board of education meeting in April 1971 showing a unanimous vote to extend Warren\u2019s teaching contract (her exit followed two months later in June). People have also surfaced a 2007 interview in which Warren paints the scenario in a different light.\n\nNone of this necessarily counters Warren\u2019s story \u2014 she likely wouldn\u2019t have been visibly pregnant in April, but would have in June, and Warren is sticking by her story. \u201cAll I know is I was 22 years old, I was six months pregnant, and the job that I had been promised for the next year was going to someone else. The principal said they were going to hire someone else for my job,\u201d she said in an interview with CBS News on Monday. Warren also defended her claims on Twitter.\n\nThis was 1971, years before Congress outlawed pregnancy discrimination\u2014but we know it still happens in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 8, 2019\n\nThe matter has stirred controversy among Warren\u2019s detractors, who say, like her claims of Native American heritage, this demonstrates a penchant for bending the truth, and among her supporters, who argue that her story stands up. It also shows the rough terrain Warren now faces as she cements her status as one of the frontrunners in the 2020 presidential race. But beyond that, the matter brings into focus a broader problem women face: discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWarren\u2019s claims and the controversy around them, explained\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Houston in 1970 with a degree in speech pathology and audiology, Warren moved with her then-husband, Jim, to New Jersey after his job transferred him there. She was subsequently hired by the Riverdale Board of Education of New Jersey, but after a year on the job, she says she was let go.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the school year, I was pretty obviously pregnant,\u201d Warren wrote in her 2014 book, A Fighting Chance. \u201cThe principal did what I think a lot of principals did back then \u2014 wished me good luck, didn\u2019t ask me back for the next school year, and hired someone else for the job.\u201d\n\nShe tells the anecdote on the campaign trail often.\n\nBut on Monday, the Free Beacon cast doubt onto Warren\u2019s story after finding minutes of an April 21, 1971, school board meeting in which a second-year teaching contract for her was approved. Then, minutes from a separate board meeting on June 16, 1971, say that her resignation had been \u201caccepted with regret.\u201d\n\nThe Free Beacon and others also pointed to a 2007 interview Warren gave at the University of California Berkeley in which her account of what happened omitted being let go by the principal.\n\n\u201cI worked in a public school system with the children with disabilities. I did that for a year, and then that summer I didn\u2019t have the education courses, so I was on an \u2018emergency certificate,\u2019 it was called,\u201d Warren said at the time. \u201cI went back to graduate school and took a couple of courses in education and said, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is going to work out for me.\u2019 I was pregnant with my first baby, so I had a baby and stayed home for a couple of years.\u201d\n\nCBS News delved into the controversy and found other pieces of evidence that reference Warren\u2019s personal life, but no firing:\n\nLocal newspaper reports from 1971 also present reasons for her leaving the school alternative to what she describes on the trail. The Paterson News, a local paper, reported that summer that Warren was \u201cleaving to raise a family.\u201d The next month, a story about the school board hiring a replacement said Warren had \u201cresigned for personal reasons,\u201d even though the board had voted to \u201cappoint\u201d Warren to the same speech pathology job that April, according to an earlier report.\n\nMinutes also show that board granted her a provisional certificate in speech pathology in November 1970.\n\nWarren told CBS News that entering into politics had led her to \u201copen up\u201d about \u201cdifferent pieces in my life,\u201d including this episode, and she stands by her version of the story. The outlet also spoke to two retired teachers who worked at the same school. They said that while they don\u2019t remember anyone being explicitly fired for being pregnant, there was little job security for pregnant women at the time. One former teacher said pregnant women were expected to leave \u201cat five months.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s defenders also note that her timeline adds up: In April, she would have been four months pregnant and therefore not visibly so, but in June, she would have been six months pregnant and unable to hide it. Her daughter was born in September. Some people also pointed to a June 1972 Associated Press article about how New Jersey\u2019s civil rights division ruled that pregnant teachers couldn\u2019t be pushed out of the classroom.\n\nEliana Johnson, editor-in-chief of the Free Beacon, said in a phone interview that the documents the publication uncovered \u201cseem to undercut\u201d Warren\u2019s story, though they doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she was lying. She tied this instance to broader pressure political candidates on both sides of the aisle seem to face to craft \u201cfoundational myths\u201d about themselves and sometimes bend the truth, such as Ben Carson claiming he got a West Point scholarship and Richard Blumenthal misrepresenting his military service. \u201cIt seems to me that these sorts of claims, whether it\u2019s Democrats or Republicans making them, warrant scrutiny,\u201d she said.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.\n\nWarren is starting to take frontrunner heat\n\nWarren, who was the first major candidate out of the gate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, has largely avoided criticism by other contenders and heightened scrutiny in the media \u2014 until now.\n\nShe has gained slowly and steadily in the polls and now, alongside former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, is considered one of the frontrunners in the race. In fact, she has almost eclipsed Biden in a RealClearPolitics average of national polls.\n\nAs Warren cements her status as one of the leaders of the pack, she\u2019s all but guaranteed to face more pressure as a candidate and have more reporters \u2014 and opposition researchers \u2014 looking into her past. This pregnancy story drama bubbled up most among conservatives and progressive Sanders supporters online.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Warren has faced scrutiny over her telling of her personal story. Early on in her presidential bid, Warren came under fire for claims of Native American heritage and releasing DNA results to try to demonstrate the veracity of those claims. (The results showed that she probably had some Native American ancestry, but a small amount.) There is also evidence Warren claimed American Indian heritage on official forms earlier in her career.\n\nThis shines a spotlight on pregnancy and gender discrimination in the workplace\n\nWhatever the details of Warren\u2019s pregnancy and teaching job, the scenario highlights a much broader issue: pregnancy and gender discrimination and the way people with families, especially women, are treated in the workplace.\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act, a federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, wasn\u2019t passed until 1978, seven years after Warren says she was let go. Despite it, pregnancy discrimination remains a problem. The New York Times earlier this year published a lengthy feature on its persistence in American culture. It found that companies still \u201csystematically sideline pregnant women\u201d in a number of ways:\n\nIn physically demanding jobs \u2014 where an increasing number of women unload ships, patrol streets and hoist boxes \u2014 the discrimination can be blatant. Pregnant women risk losing their jobs when they ask to carry water bottles or take rest breaks. In corporate office towers, the discrimination tends to be more subtle. Pregnant women and mothers are often perceived as less committed, steered away from prestigious assignments, excluded from client meetings and slighted at bonus season.\n\nIn light of the controversy surrounding Warren, many women have taken to Twitter to discuss their experiences with pregnancy discrimination, gender discrimination, and having families in the workplace.\n\nIf you have trouble believing that Elizabeth Warren experienced pregnancy discrimination because no one wrote down \"Fired because pregnant,\" you are going to be floored when you learn about the experiences of.... any other human woman you know. \u2014 Alyssa Leader (@alittleleader) October 8, 2019\n\nApparently a lot of men are just learning that pregnancy discrimination existed way back when Liz Warren was a teacher.\n\n\n\nJust wait \u2018til they hear it still exists. \u2014 The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) October 8, 2019", "description": "The 2020 presidential candidate says she faced pregnancy discrimination early in her career, and some detractors doubt her story.", "authors": ["Emily Stewart", "Hannah Brown", "Nicole Narea", "Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez Campbell", "Andrew Prokop", "Constance Grady", "Umair Irfan", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jh5lIyHMY6QPMuWBvwhNWrTAG-U=/0x0:4469x2340/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19270041/1179050364.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
