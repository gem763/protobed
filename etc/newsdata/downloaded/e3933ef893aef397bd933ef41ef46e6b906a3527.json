And the list goes on.\n\nSo is the $4.99 plan from Apple AAPL, -2.14% a lifeline, or just another bucket of water over the head?\n\nThat all depends on how much consumers want to pay and what they want to watch. Experts have found most families are willing to pay up to $50 a month for streaming services, typically paying for up to three services.\n\nMarketWatch caught up with one expert, B.J. Pichman, research manager at market research firm Comperemedia, to help wade through all the choices and consider their pros and cons.\n\nApple TV+\n\nThe pros: \u201cThe upside is going to be completely fresh and exclusive content,\u201d Pichman said. Not only that, it will probably look pretty slick too, he said \u2014 \u201ctypical Apple high production values.\u201d Big names like director Steven Spielberg and actors Steve Carell and Jennifer Aniston have signed on for projects, he noted. The video service goes live Nov. 1, while a gaming service for another $4.99 a month is scheduled to start Sept. 19.\n\nThe cons: There\u2019s not really much of a back catalog of shows and movies to pick from \u2014 not yet at least.\n\nHulu\n\nThe pros: \u201cHulu\u2019s got a lot of content. They\u2019ve got a pretty great back catalog of old television programs,\u201d he said. That includes past hit shows like Bob\u2019s Burgers, Family Guy and 30 Rock. And it\u2019s pretty quick to post current primetime programming. \u201cFor the cord cutter, they are not really missing out on any broadcast TV,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cons: \u201cOriginal programing is pretty sparse right now,\u201d noting that original shows like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d are few and far between, in his view. And then there are the commercials that viewers have to watch on the basic plan, which could actually be a pro or a con. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind the commercials, it\u2019s a very competitive price,\u201d Pichman said.\n\nDisney Plus\n\nThe pros: The Disney Plus offering will have everything from Star Wars to Bambi. \u201cIt\u2019s really great for families with children,\u201d Pichman said. The service will go live Nov. 12, replete with 7,500 episodes from various Disney shows and 500 movies \u2014 and that\u2019s just the start, Pichman said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of runway with those series to do a lot of spin-offs,\u201d Pichman noted.\n\nThe cons: Disney has a lot of offer, that\u2019s for sure. But it\u2019s still just one service, Pichman noted. \u201cThey don\u2019t have everything. It\u2019s one house.\u201d\n\nNetflix\n\nThe pros: Choice, choice, choices. There\u2019s the catalog of Hollywood movies and all the original programming like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d and \u201cOrange is the New Black.\u201d \u201cNetflix still has a lot of content,\u201d and it\u2019s pouring money into creating even more, Pichman said.\n\nThe cons: \u201cNetflix is starting to look expensive in comparison,\u201d Pichman said. While the Netflix basic plan is $8.99, the premium one is $15.99 a month. And some of the new programming coming out now leaves Pichman a little underwhelmed. \u201cThe content coming out now feels a little rushed,\u201d he said.\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nThe pros: \u201cThe fact you get it for free with Prime membership is fantastic,\u201d said Pichman. And there\u2019s also some good shows on there as well, he noted \u2014 that includes shows like \u201cTransparent,\u201d the \u201cJack Ryan\u201d series, and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d\n\nThe cons: \u201cIt feels like a benefit for Amazon Prime people that most people they don\u2019t know they have,\u201d he said. There are certainly some hits on the programming, but there are misses too. \u201cIt feels random,\u201d Pichman said of the array of shows and movies. And while Amazon Prime memberships have their perks, they aren\u2019t for everyone.\n\nHBO Now\n\nThe pros: It\u2019s a clear leader in quality programming, Pichman said. The outlet has \u201chuge well-known shows, arguably some of the best\u201d including TV icons like \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d and more recent hits like \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d and \u201cSuccession.\u201d\n\nThe cons: The price tag. \u201cNow with Disney Plus and Hulu and Apple +, HBO seems wildly expensive,\u201d Pichman said.\n\nConsumers have no shortage of choices \u2014 but certainly a shortage of time and energy. They\u2019ll have to figure out what works for them. \u201cI think attention span and time-wise, people will have hard time paying for more than three [services]\u201d Pichman said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s hard finding time to consume all that content.\u201d\n\nApple shares have been up 37% this year compared to a 15% gain for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.23% and an 18% increase for the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.01%", "description": "Viewers will weigh cost, content and convenience \u2014 and whether they have the time to watch all that content.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR053_tv_str_ZG_20190910221454.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
