(Photo: Waterpik / Reviewed)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWhen I need a few things for my apartment, I head to Amazon knowing that even if I forget what I need, I\u2019ll find something interesting worth checking out. But when I\u2019m interested in discovering new products, or just seeing what\u2019s new on the site, I usually head to Amazon\u2019s Movers and Shakers page, which highlights all the largest gainers in sales rank over the last 24 hours.\n\nSince the page covers every product category on Amazon\u2014from books to children\u2019s toys to pet supplies and more\u2014it gives you a real sense of what\u2019s actually trending across the site so you can make more informed purchasing decisions. The one catch? Because the page is completely trend-based, there\u2019s no way to tell whether these products are worth buying, or whether they\u2019re, well, just useless knick knacks.\n\nSince we spend a lot of time here at Reviewed testing and analyzing products, we decided to take a closer look at the Movers and Shakers page. While the page updates hourly and some of these items might not be trending at this very second, these are the 20 best items we've seen on it over the last week or so that absolutely live up to the hype.\n\n1. These Kindle e-readers that make it easy to read anywhere\n\nThese are our favorite Kindles for unlimited reading pleasure.

Our experts named these two Kindles as the best to own thanks to their comfortable feel, storage capacity, and Bluetooth compatibility, among other things.

We missed this product when we ranked our favorite dry shampoos of 2019, but $6 sounds like a steal when you see its 4.2-star rating on Amazon. Plus, reviewers rave about the volume and texture, light coconut scent, and lack of residue. Joelle writes, \u201cThis smells amazing! I love the texture it gave my hair as well.
