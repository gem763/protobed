He gets his power through me, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d\n\nShe then appeared to threaten the reporter, saying, \u201cSo, listen, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, if you\u2019re going to cover my personal life, then we\u2019re welcome to do the same around here. If it has nothing to do with my job, which it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019s obvious, then we\u2019re either going to expect you to cover everybody\u2019s personal life or we\u2019re going to start covering them over here.\u201d\n\nConway was taking issue with a short article Yilek wrote on Tuesday about reports that President Donald Trump was considering Conway to replace acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nIn the article, Yilek referenced George Conway, Kellyanne Conway's husband, who repeatedly scorches the president on Twitter and recently said in a podcast that Trump's closest aides should consider resigning since they have limited ability to positively influence him.\n\n\"Conway has been in the middle of Trump\u2019s barbs with her husband, George, a conservative lawyer who frequently makes headlines for his criticism of the president,\" Yilek wrote in the article.\n\nKellyanne Conway appeared Friday on Fox News to discuss the ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump, but when the reporter inquired about her clash with the Yilek, she became visibly frustrated and offered a combative defense of the call.\n\n\u201cAlso, you really didn\u2019t \u2014 respectfully, Sandra \u2014 you didn\u2019t need to show those three things,\u201d Conway told Sandra Smith after she explained the exchange to viewers and displayed a note from the Examiner\u2019s editor-in-chief. \u201cI've already disabused everybody of what he said. I never said the conversation was off the record or commented on that one way or the other. Everything I said in the phone call I've said publicly before. Every single thing. I said it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeorge and I agree on many big things. We disagree on many big things. None of that affects my job here and exactly none of that is anybody's business,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think people constantly covering that is lazy and it doesn't add to the conversation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the White House after her Fox News appearance, Conway was again pressed about the perceived threats in the call.\n\n\"I never threatened her. Excuse me, don't use that word,\" she told reporters. \"If I threaten someone, you'll know it.\"\n\n\"Don't use the word threaten, and don't use the word investigate and stop being so silly,\" she concluded. \"Honestly, stop being so silly. It's silly.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/674/1155968404_6097753751001_6097749345001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
