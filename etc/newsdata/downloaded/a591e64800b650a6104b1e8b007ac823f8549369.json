I guess that\u2019s just what it\u2019s like to be a Twitter cowboy. Cain later told CNN his words were \u201cnot a true threat at all,\u201d but a reflection of the popular Texas saying, \u201cCome and Take It.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis https://t.co/rU3WoYQFQV \u2014 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 (@BriscoeCain) September 13, 2019\n\nPer an O\u2019Rourke spokesperson, Cain has been reported to the FBI for his violent speech, which you might think would fly in the face of the \u201csanctity of life\u201d\u2013type rhetoric he uses as an anti-choice legislator in the Texas legislature. Earlier this year, Cain was an architect of the draconian heartbeat bill, which failed in the Texas House in May, that sought to ban abortion at six weeks, before most women even realize they\u2019re pregnant. When introducing it, he said in a statement, \u201cWhen you have a heartbeat you have a life and we should honor that life at all cost.\u201d So zealous is he in these views that, just this week, he took the bold stance of wanting to abolish the city of Austin, after it voted to provide $150,000 to help women retain access to abortion care.\n\nAnd yet, this isn\u2019t even the first time Cain has pulled a gun-related stunt targeting a political opponent: Last year, he was ejected from the Texas Democratic Party\u2019s state convention for sneaking a handgun inside, as part of a \u201canti-liberal prank.\u201d\n\nThe twin conservative principles of protecting both fetuses at the very moment of conception and the right to buy the kinds of guns that can (and have) murdered dozens of fully grown children in just a few minutes is a well-worn contradiction, a hypocrisy even older than the many Republican men who have been caught railing against abortion in public, then quietly paying for them in private. Restricting women\u2019s autonomy over their own bodies is a cornerstone of the Republican Party\u2019s ongoing national project, which is to consolidate power among the white and wealthy over the most vulnerable Americans.\n\nIf a Democratic candidate is going to beat Donald Trump, and help dismantle the GOP\u2019s stronghold in Congress, they will need to be able to talk about abortion. While Cain was tweeting at O\u2019Rourke, many of us watching the debates were wondering if the moderators were going to bring up the subject just once. They didn\u2019t.", "description": "Briscoe Cain, the Texas state representative who threatened presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke with his AR-15 on Twitter during the Democratic debate, is also, of course, \u201cpro life.\u201d", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/13/13-briscoe-cain-tweet-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
