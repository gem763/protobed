Along with the red-backed chairs and reversible red-and-white napkins, the tables\u2019 diminutive floral displays were also red. Surely, Van Wyck & Van Wyck designed the decor with purpose. Even the Olivier Cheng-catered lunch of tarte tatin aux tomates and lobster tail \u2014 were you guessed it \u2014 red. One attendee arrived prepared, teetering in six-inch Gaga-worthy red patent stilettos with a pair of metallic sneakers slung over one shoulder.\n\nMore from WWD\n\nBefore taking a seat for the festivities, Louboutin lingered a bit at the step-and-repeat arm-in-arm with Diane von Furstenberg outside of the David H. Koch Theater. Indoors, the promenade was abuzz with various sectors of the fashion camp. Representing the media world \u2014 past and present \u2014 were Glenda Bailey, Derek Blasberg, Hamish Bowles, Joanna Coles, Martha Stewart and Hal Rubenstein. Rounding off the retail side were Nordstrom\u2019s Jamie Nordstrom, Bergdorf Goodman\u2019s Linda Fargo, Saks Fifth Avenue\u2019s Roopal Patel and Triple Five Group\u2019s Ken Downing. As the luncheon\u2019s presenting sponsor, Nordstrom reminded attendees of the company\u2019s long-awaited New York City women\u2019s store opening on Oct. 24.\n\nThe Museum at FIT\u2019s director Valerie Steele offered something else to pencil into the fall calendar \u2014 Friday\u2019s public opening for the museum\u2019s \u201cParis, Capital of Fashion\u201d exhibition. The French-born guest of honor also plugged the show in his acceptance speech. But before he took to the stage to accept the Couture Council\u2019s award for Artistry in Fashion, his presenter Priyanka Chopra warmed up the crowd. She said, \u201cHe has achieved what so many of us just aspire to do. He has built a legacy that will outlive almost all of us for sure,\u201d adding how his iconic red-soled shoes relay a sense of pride and aspiration. \u201cThey have been immortalized by many people that we know \u2014 Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Sarah Jessica Parker, uh, me.\u201d\n\nThe actress also drew attention to less-photographed females in Louboutin\u2019s life \u2014 his four-year-old twin daughters \u2014 asking, \u201cCan you imagine being born into closets full of Louboutins?\u201d\n\nAt the podium, Louboutin pled shyness and explained the French don\u2019t give speeches. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of our culture. We don\u2019t have this British humor or American je ne sais quoi. We just don\u2019t do that. We barely say thank you,\u201d he said.\n\nTrying to do his best to say something, Louboutin thanked Brown, Nordstrom, Chopra and his team. Recalling how he first met the actress at a film festival in Morocco, Louboutin spoke of how they later reconvened in India \u201cwhere they got to share lots of great nights and dirty stories. But this was all before she was married. So Nick [Jonas], you have a fun girl by your side \u2014 so behave.\u201d\n\nAfter taking the approach that he was a best man giving a speech at a wedding, Louboutin struck a more emotional note in thanking von Furtsenberg. \u201cShe\u2019s my godmother, my sister, my traveling companion, my oracle and my partner in every crime. She opened her arms to me almost 30 years ago when I sold my first collection of shoes in America from the table in her dinning room \u2014 before I had an office.\u2026She has supported me emotionally for all of my career, I owe her so much. More than that, I love her so much. And today is probably a good day to tell her, \u2018I will never forget her for her dedication. I would like to share this award with her.\u201d\n\nAfter, von Furstneberg stood briefly to acknowledge the crowd\u2019s applause, Louboutin added, \u201cI share [it], but I keep it.\u201d\n\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.
