I don't see it as a problem I actually think we are extremely lucky to have 2 homes,\" she replied.\n\n(Image: lucymeck1/Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nIt has confirmed that the happy couple will still live in separate homes when their baby, due in February 2020, is here.\n\nBut the shock confession comes as no surprise as Lucy admitted back in August that she doesn't plan on moving in with Ryan, 35, - even after they are married.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: lucymeck1/Instagram)\n\nThe loved-up pair currently live apart and Lucy said they have no plans to change this when they become man and wife because it's what 'works best for them.'\n\nLucy owns a property in London while Ryan resides in his hometown of Manchester in order to be close to his 10-year-old daughter Scarlett, who he shares with ex partner Tina O'Brien.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe told The Sun : \"We will always have 2 homes north and south.\n\n\"It works well for us right now and we don't see it changing anytime soon.\"", "description": "The social media star, 28, has opened up about her personal life with Ryan Thomas and their plan as the baby arrives", "authors": ["Brogan-Leigh Hurst", "Image", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20728344.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Lucy-Mecklenburgh.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
