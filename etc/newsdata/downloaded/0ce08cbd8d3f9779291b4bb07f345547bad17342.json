Andrew Cuomo Compares Politics to \u2018Foreplay\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "New York Democrat Gov. Andrew Cuomo made a creepy comparison between sex and politics during a speech at an event in Syracuse on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a concept in life called foreplay,\u201d Cuomo said at the event, which focused on jobs, according to the New York Post.\n\nHe tried to relate \u201cforeplay\u201d to how Syracuse Mayor Ben Walsh and Onondaga County executive Ryan McMahon advocated hard for state funding to revitalize Syracuse and the surrounding area.\n\n\u201cIt starts with \u2018Hello, how are you today? Everything good? Pleasure to see you,\u2019\u201d continued Cuomo, drawing some laughter from the crowd. \u201c\u2018Oh, by the way, there\u2019s something else I wanted to mention.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe New York Democrat\u2019s already off-putting speech got more awkward when he compared his efforts to boost the area\u2019s economy to \u201cgoing all the way.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019ll call you in the morning.\u2019 And I did,\u201d he said, laughing loudly at his own joke, according to the Post.\n\nCuomo announced an emergency executive order banning the sale of flavored e-cigarettes last month and raised the age for purchasing them from 18 to 21.\n\nCuomo also recently blamed \u201cangry leftists\u201d for their roles in trying to impeach President Donald Trump, even though he said 24 hours earlier that he would support impeaching the president.", "description": "New York Democrat Gov.
