REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe divide among the candidates over the proposal known as Medicare for All, which would cover every American under a government health plan and essentially eliminate private insurance, was again laid bare in the opening moments of the Democratic Party\u2019s third presidential debate in Houston.\n\nBut after some sharp exchanges, several of the White House hopefuls warned that too much acrimony would distract them from the ultimate goal: defeating Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020.\n\nAfter another wave of mass shootings, the candidates all agreed on increasing restrictions on firearms to address gun violence, the latest sign that Democrats have made gun control a top priority for the first time in a generation.\n\nHere are some highlights from the debate, which featured the top 10 Democrats from a field of 20 seeking the nomination:\n\n\u2018THE DAMN BILL\u2019\n\nThe first question of the night went to Biden, asking him whether liberals like Warren and Sanders had gone too far left for mainstream Democrats.\n\nBiden quickly pivoted to healthcare, challenging Sanders of Vermont and Warren of Massachusetts to explain how they plan to pay for what some analysts expect would be a $30 trillion Medicare for All plan.\n\n\u201cThus far, my distinguished friend, the senator on my left, has not said how she\u2019s going to pay for it,\u201d said Biden, referring to Warren.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders were careful to avoid saying explicitly that middle-class families would see higher taxes, instead emphasizing that they would save money overall by eliminating medical costs.\n\n\u201cThose at the very top, the richest and corporations, are going to pay more,\u201d Warren said. \u201cMiddle-class families are going to pay less.\u201d\n\nSanders acknowledged the cost of his signature plan \u2013 but said studies show the status quo will cost Americans $50 trillion over the same time period.\n\n\u201cI wrote the damn bill, if I may say so,\u201d he said, repeating his main applause line from the second debate in July.\n\nBiden emphasized that his plan would allow people who like their private insurance to keep it, a key point of distinction from Sanders\u2019 and Warren\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear - I\u2019ve actually never met anybody who likes their health insurance company,\u201d Warren replied. \u201cI\u2019ve met people who like their doctors.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders noted Americans spend far more per capita on healthcare than Canadians, Biden interrupted, saying, \u201cThis is America.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans don\u2019t want to pay twice as much as other countries,\u201d Sanders shot back.\n\nMEDICARE FOR ALL: A BOLD IDEA OR A BAD IDEA?\n\nOther candidates seeking to make their mark on the stage also took aim at Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan.\n\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has run as a moderate, said Sanders\u2019 proposal would force millions of people off their insurance plans.\n\n\u201cWhile he wrote the bill, I read the bill,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bold idea, I think that\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg sought to contrast his proposal to offer a government plan as an alternative, which he describes as \u201cMedicare for all who want it,\u201d with Sanders\u2019 more sweeping reform.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that it doesn\u2019t trust the American people,\u201d he said of the senator\u2019s plan. \u201cI trust you to choose what makes the most sense for you.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California, who has released her own Medicare for All plan, redirected the conversation toward Trump. She noted that the current administration has sought to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, in federal court.\n\n\u201cI think this discussion has given the American people a headache,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat they want to know is that they\u2019re going to have healthcare and the cost.\u201d\n\n\u2018A HOUSE DIVIDED\u2019\n\nFollowing the heated discussion about healthcare in the first 40 minutes of the debate, several candidates stressed the importance of standing together as Democrats, saying fighting one another would play into Trump\u2019s hands.\n\nMoments after former U.S. Housing Secretary Julian Castro, 44, of Texas accused Biden, 76, of forgetting what he had just said two minutes earlier \u2013 a comment seemingly aimed at Biden\u2019s age that many in the audience jeered \u2013 Buttigieg called for civility.\n\n\u201cThis is why presidential debates are becoming unwatchable,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThis reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. Scoring points against each other, poking at each other.\u201d\n\nCastro was unbowed. \u201cThat\u2019s called an election. This is what we\u2019re here for, it\u2019s an election.\u201d\n\n\u201cA house divided cannot stand,\u201d said Klobuchar, quoting Civil War-era President Abraham Lincoln. \u201cAnd that is not how we\u2019re going to win this.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed by U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who said while they had differences on how to pay for and deliver healthcare, every person on stage believed in universal care.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sacrifice progress on the altar of purity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018HELL YES, WE\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR AR-15\u2019\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman from El Paso whose hometown was the site of a racially motivated mass shooting that killed 22 people last month, minced no words when asked whether he was proposing confiscating assault-style rifles.\n\n\u201cHell, yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said in a moment that instantly went viral, describing those guns as weapons that belong on the battlefield, not in America.\n\nIn a sign of just how much the Democratic Party has shifted on gun control, the ensuing discussion focused on ideas once seen as political dynamite: gun buybacks, assault weapon bans and licensing requirements.\n\nBooker, who has proposed a national licensing system, said he has seen the impact of everyday gun violence in Newark, where he lives in a largely minority and low-income community and where he was mayor.\n\n\u201cThese mass shootings are tragedies, but the majority of the homicide victims come from neighborhoods like mine,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Warren and Sanders blamed corruption and a Congress beholden to the gun industry for failing to pass meaningful gun reform like universal background checks. Biden touted his work in passing the original assault weapons ban decades ago, despite opposition from the National Rifle Association.\n\nAnd Harris repeated her contention that Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric had inspired the El Paso shooter, who apparently wrote an anti-immigrant screed before the attack.\n\n\u201cObviously he didn\u2019t pull the trigger, but he\u2019s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition,\u201d she said of Trump.\n\nOBAMA\u2019S LEGACY\n\nDuring the first two debates, some candidates questioned former President Barack Obama\u2019s failure to include a public option as part of the Affordable Care Act and his mass deportations of illegal immigrants as a way of attacking Biden, Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s debate, however, candidates went out of their way to praise Obama, who remains the party\u2019s most popular figure.\n\n\u201cI want to credit President Obama for bringing us this far,\u201d Harris said of Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law. Castro said America \u201cowed a debt of gratitude\u201d to Obama for the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nAnd Warren, who wants to scrap Obamacare, nevertheless praised the former president for the advances he made in providing health insurance to millions more Americans.\n\nBut Castro would later go after Biden for distancing himself from the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, accusing the former vice president of cherry-picking parts of Obama\u2019s record when it suits him.\n\n\u201cEvery time something good about Barack Obama comes up, he says, \u2018Oh, I was there, I was there, I was there, that\u2019s me, too,\u2019 and then every time somebody questions part of the administration that we were both part of, he says, \u2018Well, that was the president,\u2019\u201d Castro said.\n\nGiven the chance to respond, Biden said: \u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years, good, bad and indifferent.\u201d\n\nYANG ANNOUNCES $120,000 \u2018FREEDOM DIVIDEND\u2019 GIVEAWAY\n\nAndrew Yang, the entrepreneur whose campaign is centered on a proposal to give every American a universal basic income of $1,000 a month, announced at the debate\u2019s outset that he was ready to put his plan to the test.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to trust ourselves more than our politicians,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to do something unprecedented tonight: My campaign will now give a \u2018freedom dividend\u2019 of $1,000 a month for an entire year to 10 American families, someone watching this at home right now.\u201d\n\nThe unorthodox gambit left Klobuchar dissolving into admiring laughter, while Buttigieg started his own remarks by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s original, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders \u2013 the leading contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2013 wasted no time in Thursday's debate sparring over how to best expand healthcare coverage for Americans.", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429306540&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0AK", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
