We have the Indian Premier League (cricket), Indian Super League(football), Pro Kabaddi League (Kabaddi), Hockey India League (Hockey), yet there is no similar for basketball.\n\nNBA is one of the most popular and watched leagues in the world - attracting the top players across the world, with a revenue amounting to billions of dollars.\n\nAFP\n\nEven if we aren't ardent followers of basketball and NBA, we have heard the names of the current top crop of players Lebron James, Kyrie Irving, Stephen Curry, and the former famous legends like Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nIndia has it's own NBA connection - the owner of Sacramento Kings is Mumbai born Vivek Ranadive, the man who pushed for the games to be held in his hometown.\n\nRanadive takes keen interest in the sport and also owned a stake previously of another NBA side Golden State Warriors.

Not only will these games bring more audiences, it will act as a precursor for more international tournaments to be hosted by the country.\n\nSatnam Singh/ESPN\n\nWith Bollywood and business magnate Mukesh Ambani in attendance, the game between Indiana Pacers and Sacramento Kings gave a fitting picture of what NBA and basketball has to offer - sensational talent, exceptional play, and vocal crowds.\n\nThe NBA passed its Indian audition with aplomb, wit another game today - it promises to be another feast and exhibition of crazy manoeuvres.\n\nFor basketball to develop and take the next big stride in India, NBA India Games is a perfect platform to launch the next big chapter - where the sport is a force to be reckoned with.", "description": "National Basketball Association's much anticipated India debut got off to a rollicking start as Indiana Pacers beat Sacramento Kings 132-131 in an absolute thriller.
