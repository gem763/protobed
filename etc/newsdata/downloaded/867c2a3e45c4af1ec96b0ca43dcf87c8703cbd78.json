These firms make a large chunk of their revenue from the United States.\n\nFalling for a second straight session, the banking sector dropped 0.5 per cent to lead losses in Australia's main index. The \"Big Four\" banks shed between 0.7 per cent and 1.1 per cent.\n\nWealth manager IOOF Holdings marked its highest in a year, advancing as much as 6 per cent, after the sale price it had to pay for Australia and New Zealand Banking's pension assets was shaved off by 13 per cent on Thursday.\n\nIn further windfall for IOOF, the banking regulator on Friday stood down from appealing a Federal Court decision to dismiss its regulatory action against the wealth manager.\n\nOil and gas producers Woodside Petroleum and Santos both retreated up to 1.5 per cent, a day after strong results had propelled their shares.\n\nThe New Zealand benchmark declined 0.3 per cent, or 26.11 points, to 11,115.75. Specialist outdoor retailer Kathmandu Holdings was the top loser, dropping as much as 2.2 per cent.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [BENGALURU] Australian shares dropped on Friday as a weaker US dollar dented blue-chip healthcare firms that have offshore operations, while fears of a slide into recession continued to dog sentiment amid scepticism over the Brexit deal and Sino-US talks. .
