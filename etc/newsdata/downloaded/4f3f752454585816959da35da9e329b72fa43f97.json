There\u2019s an expectation that we can win games regardless of who\u2019s in our lineup and that\u2019s how we approach it.\u201d\n\nTanev, Pittsburgh\u2019s biggest free-agent pickup in the offseason, spent the first four seasons of his career with Winnipeg, earning a reputation as a quality penalty killer and a hard-working, two-way player who can chip in at both ends of the ice.\n\nTanev, who set career highs in goals and points last year, scored his first goal with the Penguins at 3:57 of overtime and joined Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux as the only players in franchise history to score an overtime goal while short-handed.\n\nTanev swooped into the zone and threw a shot on goal that went between Philipp Grubauer\u2019s pads. Colorado forward Gabriel Landeskog knocked the puck into the net, giving Pittsburgh its fourth straight win for the first time since an eight-game winning streak last season.\n\n\u201cI saw some open ice and just wanted to get one to the net,\u201d Tanev said. \u201cI was fortunate enough to get a generous bounce.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s Sidney Crosby continued a season-long, seven-game point streak, scoring his fourth goal of the season. Jake Guentzel added to his six-game point streak with his fifth goal in four games. Matt Murray made 26 saves.\n\nThe Avalanche, the NHL\u2019s last unbeaten team, looked to start the season with six straight wins for the first time since 2013-14. The best start in franchise history came during the 1985-86 season, when the team was located in Quebec and the Nordiques opened 7-0.\n\nNathan MacKinnon scored his third for Colorado, off an assist from Mikko Rantanen. Both have a six-game point streak to open the season. Matt Calvert also scored, and Grubauer stopped 30 shots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re happy with the outcome or how we played,\u201d Grubauer said. \u201cA couple games ago, we weren\u2019t playing great and found a way to get two points. Maybe this was a little bit of a reality check.\u201d\n\nSullivan credited the Penguins\u2019 leadership while the team is without so many players.\n\nJared McCann missed the game with a lower-body injury, forcing defenseman Juuso Riikola to play left wing on the team\u2019s fourth line.\n\nEvgeni Malkin and Nick Bjugstad have been out for five games, while Alex Galchenyuk missed his fourth on Wednesday. All have lower-body injuries. Bryan Rust has been out since the start of the season with an upper-body injury.\n\n\u201cI think our veteran guys have really stepped up,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIn some ways, the young guys are helping the veterans by bringing the energy and our veterans are providing leadership and playing the game the right way.\u201d\n\nCrosby and Guentzel stepped up early for Pittsburgh.\n\nCrosby evened the score at 17:22 of the first on an individual effort with the teams at 4-on-4. He chipped the puck past Erik Johnson along the boards, worked around Samuel Girard in the slot and backhanded a shot past a fallen Grubauer.\n\nGuentzel gave Pittsburgh a 2-1 lead at 15:30 of the second. He took a pass from Crosby, pulled the puck under Ryan Graves\u2019 stick and flicked a wrist shot over Grubauer\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201c(Guentzel) got a great pass from Sid, but to get the puck under the stick, onto his forehand and under the bar the way he did, that\u2019s a goal-scorer\u2019s goal,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring the way he plays.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Penguins D Kris Letang surpassed Jean Pronovost for fifth on the team\u2019s all-time games-played list with 754. Letang\u2019s season-opening six-game point streak ended. \u2026 Avalanche D Cale Makar was unable to become the second defenseman in NHL history to begin his regular-season career with a six-game point streak. \u2026 Avalanche F J.T. Compher returned after missing three games with a lower-body injury. \u2026 Colorado didn\u2019t score a power-play goal in a game for the first time this season. \u2026 Pittsburgh has seven wins and points in eight of its last 10 home games against the Avalanche.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nAvalanche: Continue a season-long six-game trip Friday at Florida.\n\nPenguins: Host Dallas on Friday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan believes his undermanned Penguins can beat any team right now, despite missing five of their top nine forwards.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Scifo"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
