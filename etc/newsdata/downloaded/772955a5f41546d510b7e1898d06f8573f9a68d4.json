Many of those loans were packaged into bonds.\n\nSantander Consumer is one of the largest subprime auto lenders in the market. The rapid failure of some of its loans implies that a growing number of borrowers may be getting loans based on fraudulent application information, a problem the company has had before, and that weaker consumers are increasingly struggling. During last decade\u2019s housing crunch, mortgage loans started souring within months of being made, signaling growing problems in the market.\n\nSubprime car loans aren\u2019t in a crisis, but lenders across the industry are facing more difficulty. Delinquencies for auto loans in general, including both prime and subprime, have reached their highest levels this year since 2011.\n\nSantander Consumer had sold to bond investors many of the loans that are going bad. When the debt sours soon after the securities are sold, the company is often obliged to buy the loans back, shifting potential losses on the loans to the original lender and away from bond investors.\n\n\u201cThis could eventually be a problem for the company and impact its actual performance,\u201d said Kevin Barker, an equity analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co. Souring loans can cut into profitability, he said, adding that the company can raise its lending standards to reduce losses on new financing it provides.\n\nA Santander Consumer USA spokeswoman said the firm\u2019s asset-backed securities performance has been consistent over time, and are structured with credit enhancement levels that are appropriate for the risk profile of the securitizations. The firm \u201cdoes repurchase loans from its securitizations for various reasons, which have been consistent over time and in line with the requirements of our transactions,\u201d she said.\n\nOn earnings calls this year, executives at Santander Consumer have said that the company is less likely to cut deals with borrowers that fall behind on their obligations now. That results in the lender writing off more bad loans, but also cuts the balance of troubled credits it is looking to restructure.\n\nChrysler Tie\n\nSantander Consumer had $26.3 billion of subprime auto loans as of June 30 that it either owned, or bundled into bonds, according to a report from S&P Global Ratings. That represents nearly half of the company\u2019s total managed loans. The percentage of borrowers behind on their loans climbed to 14.50% from 13.80% a year earlier for the loans the company collects payments on, S&P said.\n\nThe uptick in delinquencies and defaults may be tied to Santander Consumer\u2019s efforts to win more business from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV after tightening its longtime financing partnership with the carmaker in July. The updated agreement, which included a one-time payment of $60 million from Santander Consumer to Fiat Chrysler, came after the carmaker\u2019s chief financial officer had said last year that his company was looking at forming its own financing business in the U.S.\n\nBut the rising losses may also be a sign that the weakest borrowers are having growing financial trouble as economic growth shows signs of slowing. The percentage of borrowers that are at least 90 days late on their car loans is broadly growing, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. At the end of 2018, the number of delinquent loans exceeded 7 million, the highest total in the two decades the New York Fed has kept track.\n\nLowering Standards?\n\nLenders don\u2019t seem to be broadly tightening their standards in response. About 21% of new auto loans made in the first half of this year went to subprime borrowers, a slight increase from last year\u2019s pace. The subprime loans made in the first two quarters amounted to around $61 billion.\n\nIn fact, banks and finance companies are making increasingly longer-term loans for cars, a sign they\u2019re taking more risk by waiting longer to get fully repaid. The terms of loans reached record highs in the second quarter, averaging 72.9 months for subprime new vehicle loans, according to Experian.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A growing percentage of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc.\u2019s subprime auto loans are turning out to be clunkers soon after the cars are driven off the lot.Some loans made last year are souring at the fastest rate since 2008, with more consumers than usual defaulting within the first", "authors": ["Adam Tempkin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/D_6gha.o_sCWfrpFiWXQZw--~B/aD04MjI7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/89100344f8b9ac066a2e2424c3ff9326", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
