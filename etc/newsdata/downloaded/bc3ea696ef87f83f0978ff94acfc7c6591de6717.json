The event is set to take place at Sun Yat Sen Place at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) from 5pm to 7pm on October 18.\n\n\u201cMore and more arrested protesters have opened up about their unfair treatment by the police, from verbal abuse to sexual assault \u2026 there are so many examples,\u201d an organiser wrote on Instagram.\n\nHong Kong protests: Students warned human chains at schools could be considered illegal assemblies\n\nThey are calling for students across Hong Kong to join the rally, which will feature a sharing session by barrister Billy Li On-yin, one of the conveners of the Progressive Lawyers Group, and a first aid provider, who will share their thoughts about what they see as abuse of power by police during the protests.\n\nThe organiser also mentioned that participants can wear a face mask to the rally, on the grounds that the event is held on campus, which is private property. But legal experts warned that, while the university campus is privately owned, it is considered a public place, meaning participants are subject to the anti-mask law.\n\nStuart Hargreaves, a professor in the Faculty of Law at Chinese University, said that, under the Public Order Ordinance, any place where the public are permitted access is defined as a public space, so the anti-mask law can be applied to participants of the student rally.\n\nAlthough the University of Hong Kong is private property, students may still be subject to the anti-mask law.

Still, she believes students risk violating the anti-mask law, as the event could easily fall within other circumstances that are regulated by the law.\n\nIn response to an inquiry, a HKU spokesperson said the university\u2019s Student Union is a co-organiser of the rally, but did not comment on whether the event has been approved. Young Post reached out to the Student Union for comment, but did not get a response before going to press.\n\nHong Kong protests: What are the 'five demands'? What do protesters want?\n\nMeanwhile, more than 100 students and alumni of Hon Wah College formed a human chain outside the school yesterday morning. Their protest was in support of the student who was asked to take off his black face mask by the school last week.\n\nMasked participants gathered on Harmony Road in Siu Sai Wan around 7am. They chanted slogans such as \u201cFive demands, not one less\u201d and \u201cHongkongers, resist!\u201d, and sang protests songs. Students from neighbouring schools also joined in.\n\nA former Hon Wah College student told the media that the school has a pro-China stance, and that students cannot express their opinions freely. If they did, they could be penalised by the school.", "description": "Mass gathering is set to take place on private property at university campus, but participants could still be subject to anti-mask law.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/9214a1ce-ee41-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires181726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
