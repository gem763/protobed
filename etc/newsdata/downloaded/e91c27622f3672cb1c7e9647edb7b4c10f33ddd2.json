Fifteen members of the group were arrested this week in Gothenburg in connection to drug trafficking cases, Sveriges Radio reports.\n\nEarlier this week, Gothenburg police arrested 15 drug smugglers connected to an international cocaine and heroin smuggling ring, finding 115 million Swedish kronor\u2019s ($11,647,775/\u00a39,467,375) worth of drugs.\n\nSwedish customs say they seized approximately 300lbs of narcotics in total, including 110lbs of heroin. Prosecutor Anna Svedin noted that the network was based in the Netherlands and said: \u201cSome of the defendants have links to Black Ax, but not all.\u201d\n\nLennart Karlsson, intervention manager at the Klara area in Stockholm, said that police have noted an increased presence of the Nigerian mafia in recent years.

They often meet people who have been told to come here and get contacts to get a job. But then the Black Ax members hang outside and attract them,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThis organisation works with both prostitution and drug trafficking,\u201d he added.\n\nKarlsson labelled the Nigerian mafia \u201cone of the world\u2019s most effective crime syndicates\u201d and went on to note: \u201cSo unfortunately for us, they probably have a pretty bright future.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian mafia is also known to use juju, a Nigerian equivalent of voodoo, to force migrants to become drug traffickers or prostitutes. This technique has been seen elsewhere in Europe such as Spain and Italy where the Nigerian mafia also operates.\n\nEarlier this year, Italian police warned of the potential of Islamic radicalisation among the Nigerian mafia, saying that the influence of terrorist groups like Boko Haram was spreading among mafia members.", "description": "Stockholm police have warned of the growing influence of the \"Black Ax\", a Nigerian criminal gang connected to drug trafficking.", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/GettyImages-906225764.png", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
