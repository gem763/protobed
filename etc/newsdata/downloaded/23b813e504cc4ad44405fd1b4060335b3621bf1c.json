Many Kashmiris demand either a merger with Pakistan or an independent state.\n\nThe abrogation of Kashmir's special status was accompanied by the detention of hundreds of political leaders and activists, including pro-India politicians as well as those who had been resisting Indian rule, from the region.", "description": "Police say no reports of casualties from the fighting following a raid in a village south of India-administered region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/6eff6f1dbe2946fa968a494e2d6c4aa1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
