His opponent Tiger (right) agreed, adding he respected kung fu\n\nDing's opponent is 25-year-old Chen Jinyun, nicknamed Tiger, who is a Chinese kick-boxer and Muay Thai practitioner.\n\nTheir fight, which had been highly anticipated, was part of the Chongwu Hero World Kick-boxing City Tour.\n\nPrior to the duel, Ding said his goal was to demonstrate real-life combat abilities of Wing Chun.\n\nHe claims to be a fourth-generation descendant of Ip Man, a master teacher of Wing Chun and a mentor of late Hollywood star Bruce Lee.\n\nWing Chun is a type of Chinese martial arts originating in southern China's Guangdong Province, which allows practitioners to defend themselves against bigger and stronger rivals using close-range combat.\n\nThe style has gained widespread popularity after Hong Kong actor Donnie Yen portrayed Ip Man in a series of blockbuster films.\n\nDing's swift defeat has sparked controversy online, with many web users accusing him of lying about his kung fu qualification. One web user accused him of demonstrating 'fake Wing Chun'\n\nDing had to start defending himself as soon as the game began.\n\nHe was kicked in the chest twice and took a few heavy blows from Tiger in less than 20 seconds.\n\nTiger then grabbed Ding by the head and kneed him repeatedly.\n\nAlthough Ding attempted to attack Tiger several times, he was hit in the leg again and again by Tiger's sidekicks.\n\nThe fight came to a swift end when Ding was knocked to the ground by a fly-kick from Tiger and failed to get up.\n\nThis is the second embarrassing defeat for Ding in the space of less than two years.\n\nIn March last year, he was battered by MMA fighter and coach Xu Xiaodong, who beat him to the ground six times in a three-round live game.\n\nMany Chinese web users called Ding a 'scam master' on Twitter-like Weibo and accused him of lying about his Wing Chun qualification.\n\nOne user known as 'Naflllla' said: 'How on earth is this Wing Chun? You think I haven't watched the film?'\n\nAnother user known as 'Musterliu' claimed Ding's kung fu was 'nothing but flowery hitting motion and fancy footwork'.\n\nA third user known as 'Feng Fei Ying Hua' wrote: 'It's fake Wing Chun.'\n\nIp Man, who died in 1972, is played by Hong Kong actor Donnie Yen in film series Ip Man\n\nIp Man was a mentor of Hollywood star Bruce Lee. The picture shows them practising kung fu\n\nDing was knocked out due to his lack of experience fighting in a boxing ring, claimed his master Yu Changhua who also acts as his publicist.\n\n'We traditional kung fu practitioners normally fight on wooden floor or cement, which doesn't bounce. We rarely fight in a ring,' Yu told MailOnline.\n\n'It's possible that when he was moving around that night, he couldn't get used to it and became a little nervous,' said Yu who owns a Wing Chun centre in the city of Nanchang.\n\n'He wasn't relaxed and didn't showcase his normal skills,' he explained.\n\nHe added: 'Ding Hao is a top fighter in our centre and has been practising kung fu for more than 10 years.\n\n'He will not be frustrated by the loss of just one game. Instead, he will ponder on the reasons of the failure and prepare for future games even better.'\n\nThis is the second embarrassing defeat for Ding (pictured) in the space of less than two years. In March last year, he was battered by MMA fighter and coach Xu Xiaodong in a live game\n\nThe winner of the fight Tiger said he respected traditional kung fu.\n\n'After all, it has more than 5,000 years of history in China,' Tiger told MailOnline.\n\nHe also defended Ding, calling him a master and real kung fu fighter.\n\nHe said: 'I had spent more than one month preparing for the fight. It was a challenge for me too.\n\n'Before the game I was confident to win. But once the game started and I engaged with Wing Chun Master Ding, I could feel how strong he was.'\n\nThe kick-boxer said Ding could have won if he had had more experience in live combat.", "description": "Ding Hao, 29, who claims to be a descendant of Wing Chun master Ip Man, was humiliated in front of a live audience at a packed arena on Saturday by 25-year-old Chinese kick-boxer known as 'Tiger'.", "authors": ["Tracy You For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027448-0-image-a-2_1571735489872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
