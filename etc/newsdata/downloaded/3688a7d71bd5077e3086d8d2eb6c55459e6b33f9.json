The new 6-Series TVs add quantum dots to the mix, and start at $599 for a 55-inch version. However, there's still some of the 2018-era TVs to clear out, and TCL has announced that Best Buy will sell the 55-inch version for just $399.\n\nThe sale starts at 2 AM ET on Friday morning and will run through Sunday night, or as long as supplies last.
