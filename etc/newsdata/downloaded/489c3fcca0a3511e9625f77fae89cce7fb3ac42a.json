Only excuse would be a problem with the birth or health of baby or mother. If all is well, he needs to get to St. Louis. Inexcusable. Will it matter?\"\n\nIt didn't matter. The Nationals ended up winning the game, and fans, franchise leaders and teammates came to Hudson's defense.\n\n\"Boss moves by Daniel Hudson missing Game 1 of the #NLCS for #paternityleave to be there for the birth of his daughter,\" wrote Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian on Instagram. \"I'm buying his jersey right now.\"\n\n\"It's all about family, man,\" Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo told USA Today after the Nationals' win. \"We said, 'You have to take care of your family,' that's a No. 1 priority and you do what you have to do. No second thoughts about that, by any means.\"\n\n\"If your reaction to someone having a baby is anything other than, 'Congratulations, I hope everybody's healthy,' you're an a------,\" Sean Doolittle, a fellow Nationals pitcher, told reporters. \"As important as our careers are to us as players, nothing is more important to us than our families. Our careers will end someday, but family is forever.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We sacrifice so much and we miss so much during our careers. We miss graduations and weddings. Lots of players might miss their kids' first steps or first words. They're gone six to eight months out of the year and can't take their kids to school or help their wives with taking care of the kids. So when he said, 'Hey, I need a day to be with my family because my wife is about to give birth,' it was a no-brainer for me, and we focused all our energy on picking him up.\"\n\nHudson said he is grateful for the support he and his family have received. \"We were made aware of a lot of negative comments, but everybody's got their opinions and everybody's got their own priorities,\" he told NBC Sports. \"And this organization was 100% on board with what my priorities are, and I'm really appreciative of that.\"", "description": "On Oct. 11, the Washington Nationals announced that pitcher Daniel Hudson would be placed on postseason paternity leave so that he could be present for the birth of his daughter.
