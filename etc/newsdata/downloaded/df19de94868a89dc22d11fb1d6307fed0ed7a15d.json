But neither can we make a sport as fantastic as this one because of the latest result.\n\n\"We must learn from defeats to be able to exceed our limits and that begins by accepting that you don't always win and that the opponent also works hard and makes merits. You must always react with dignity to the result, regardless of whether it is good or bad. \"\n\nBut Arsene has claimed Tottenham have been \u201cdestabilised\u201d by their move to a new stadium like his old Arsenal side.\n\nAnd the former Gunners boss said Mauricio Pochettino's side now lack their previous hunger and energy just as fans demand more than Champions League qualification.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nWenger spoke up in support of the Argentine but admitted he saw parallels with Arsenal when they moved to the Emirates in 2006 \u2013 and then did not win a major trophy for eight years.\n\n\u201cWell yes, I would say that they\u2019re a bit destabilised as well,\u201d said the Frenchman who left the Gunners last year.\n\n\u201cWhen I played them two or three years ago they looked like a young hungry team who had found a good strength and a good core, with people who were growing together inside the club, and players from outside who are vital like [Christian] Eriksen.\n\n\u201cToday, you don\u2019t feel exactly the same chemistry, and a player like Eriksen is a bit sidelined because he looks like he doesn\u2019t want to commit his future at the club.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nArsenal's trophy drought followed three Premier League titles while Pochettino has never won any silverware.\n\nBut Wenger told beIN SPORTS: \u201cI think he has done very well, which everybody acknowledges.\n\n\u201cWhen he came to Tottenham he slowly built them up with a very good young generation and every year people want something more from you.\n\n\u201cI experienced that at Arsenal. We were twenty consecutive years in the top four but in the end it was not enough anymore. Today if you get into the Champions League people are very happy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s happened to Pochettino, when you have been somewhere for four or five years, you have to show people you can give more - he is at that stage.\u201d", "description": "Tottenham were beaten 3-0 by Brighton on Saturday just days after they shipped seven against Bayern Munich in the Champions League", "authors": ["Neil Mcleman", "Image", "Mark Pain Pa Images Contributor", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529160.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-AMEX-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
