A record number of cities and states will celebrate Indigenous People\u2019s Day and reject Columbus Day, which activists both Native and non-Native, argue commemorates genocide, rape, colonization, and cultural degradation. In 2015, professor and artist Melanie Yazzie, a founding member of The Red Nation, along with other Native activists, petitioned the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico, to officially establish Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Day and this year the state followed suit.\n\nYazzie said that changing the holiday is an important consciousness-raising effort, but more importantly, it lays the groundwork for other organizing efforts that center the needs of Native communities. \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d Yazzie said. \u201cI mean, people were crying. That\u2019s how significant it was. And, it was a feeling I had when I saw Standing Rock...I think people had that feeling: our people are rising up and we\u2019re actually winning something for once. Like we\u2019re not being brutalized today. We won today.\u201d Here are a few more artists, activists, and leaders you should know.\n\nElizabeth Peratrovich.
