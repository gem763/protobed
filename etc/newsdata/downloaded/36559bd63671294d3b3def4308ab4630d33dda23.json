REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo\n\nNow gay rights activist Melusi Simelane plans to go further by timing Pride events to coincide with independence anniversary celebrations in September to draw attention to the country\u2019s colonial-era law against sodomy.\n\n\u201cWe are looking at the history of colonisation and the common-law offence, which is a hangover of colonisation,\u201d Simelane told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of the One Young World forum in Britain.\n\n\u201cWe want to celebrate our Pride in September to say, \u2018While you guys are saying you are free to be who you are because you are now an independent country, we also want to be free and let go of all those colonial laws\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for the government of eSwatini could not be reached for comment on Friday.\n\nGoverned by Africa\u2019s last absolute monarch, eSwatini is an impoverished, land-locked nation of 1.5 million people that borders South Africa and Mozambique.\n\nIt gained independence from Britain in September 1968 and is among a number of African countries to retain colonial-era laws against consensual gay sex, though it does not enforce them.\n\nConservative attitudes against LGBT+ people are widespread in eSwatini. The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), a pressure group, says they face pervasive discrimination and violence.\n\nStigma and prejudice are \u201crampant\u201d, said Simelane, ranging from family life to jobs, healthcare and housing, while there is no legal protection from discrimination for LGBT+ people.\n\n\u201cIf I wake up and am feeling ill and I go to a hospital, the fact that I have dreadlocks, the fact that I\u2019ve got an earring, the fact that I\u2019ve got nail polish \u2013 that\u2019s an issue for the nurse because now they are thinking of my sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cBecause there is no legal recourse for that kind of stigma or discrimination or prejudice, it makes it easier for them to continue persecuting us,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that despite pledges from officials they would not enforce the law on sodomy, its existence created fear.\n\n\u201cIt is like a gun that is pointing at us and (the government is saying) \u2018Our policy is not to shoot at you but we are going to keep the gun there\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Theresa May said last year that she regretted Britain\u2019s role in anti-gay legislation across its former colonies, saying such laws \u201cwere wrong then and they are wrong now\u201d.\n\nCommonwealth countries Botswana and Mozambique have dropped colonial anti-gay legislation in recent years.\n\nThe plan to move eSwatini\u2019s Pride rally to September is a departure from tradition. Such events are usually held in June to honour the Stonewall riots in New York in June 1969 that are popularly hailed as the birth of the modern LGBT+ movement.\n\nSimelane was a driving force of the country\u2019s first Pride march two years ago and founded the new LGBT+ rights group eSwatini Sexual & Gender Minorities this year.\n\nHe said he was frequently the target of abuse and lived in fear, but remained hopeful for change and increased rights for LGBT+ people.\n\n\u201cI am afraid \u2013 obviously, we have to live in fear. But I am not afraid in a sense that I would then just pack up,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am going to stay here as far as it is safe for me ... Because if I run, then who will do what I do?\u201d", "description": "LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When LGBT+ people took to the streets last year for the first ever Pride march in eSwatini, formerly known as Swaziland, some hardly believed they could celebrate the event in a country where stigma is rife and gay sex remains illegal.", "authors": ["Sonia Elks", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445164995&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P0A1-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
