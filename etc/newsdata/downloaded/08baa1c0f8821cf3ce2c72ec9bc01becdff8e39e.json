Firm founded by David Cameron's mother-in-law warns of hit from Brexit: A high-end furniture seller co-founded by David Cameron\u2019s mother-in-law has warned its earnings could be hit by Brexit as losses widened. Oka made \u00a332m of revenue from selling dining tables and sofas for as much as \u00a36,050, but losses widened to \u00a38.2m from \u00a3180,000 for the 11 months from January to the end of December, Companies House accounts showed.\n\n4) Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse is expected to cost the taxpayer an extra \u00a360m in unpaid wages, holiday pay and redundancy fees. The bill - which is on top of the cost of repatriating more than 150,000 holidaymakers - was revealed as it emerged that Brussels rules prevented hundreds of Thomas Cook shops from accessing a critical tax break ahead of the firm's collapse.\n\n5) Gisela Abbam, the first black chair of the British Science Association, has been named Black British Businessperson of the Year.

Market pricing for a Fed interest-rate cut at the next meeting climbed.\n\nThis week\u2019s slew of poor data confirmed the global economy is struggling for traction, and went some way to validating concerns the weakness may be seeping from the manufacturing sector into consumer sentiment, as the US-China trade war continues.\n\nThat\u2019s also driving bets that the Fed will pump more stimulus into the economy this year. Focus now turns to the non-farm payrolls figure, and then to Powell\u2019s address later Friday.\n\n\u201cThe facts are that the U.S. consumer still looks terrific, we\u2019re coming into a third quarter earnings season where we\u2019re not seeing revisions downward or upward either, and that\u2019s all pretty good news for the market,\u201d Sherry Paul at UBS Global Wealth Management told Bloomberg TV.
