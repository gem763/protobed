Other clumps of new stars form a nose and mouth.\"\n\nA menacing looking face was formed by a collision between two galaxies. NASA, ESA, and J. Dalcanton, B.F. Williams, and M. Durbin (University of Washington)\n\nThe head-on collision will give the galaxies a ring structure for about 100 million years, which is a rare cosmic circumstance, according to NASA. Eventually, in about 1 or 2 billion years, the two galaxies will fully merge.\n\nBut in the meantime, don't let the spooky image haunt your dreams. The galactic ghoul is about 704 million light-years away from Earth.\n\nAs for the image that resembles a menacing pumpkin head, fit only for a character from Sleepy Hollow, it was originally taken in 2014 by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and re-shared on Twitter Monday. The sun's active regions are lit up as markers of an intense and complex set of magnetic fields hovering in the sun's atmosphere, NASA said.\n\n\"This image blends together two sets of wavelengths at 171 and 193 angstroms, typically colorized in gold and yellow, to create a particularly Halloween-like appearance,\" NASA said on its site.", "description": "The agency posted images of a celestial phenomenon that looked like a galactic ghoul and the sun resembling a menacing jack-o'-lantern.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4268734/1000x563_nbc-191029-pumpkin-sun-cs-403p_677b6decea957cc1af007058f972644b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
