He still plays like he\u2019s much younger than he is, and puts up numbers that guys 15 years younger would be envious of.\n\nBut the New England Patriots\u2019 QB isn\u2019t impervious to the unceasing march of time. He knows that it takes longer for him to recover from week to week, and makes his body more fragile. Neither he nor the Patriots can reverse it (though both have probably tried), but they can manage it.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Brady has been limited in three of the Pats last four practices, and protecting his 42-year-old body is the reason.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\"Football is a contact sport. I wouldn't say I'm a spring chicken anymore,\" Brady told ESPN on Wednesday. \"I'm trying to just feel as great as I can and we'll see how it goes tomorrow. But I feel pretty good.\"\n\nLimiting Brady\u2019s practice time isn\u2019t the only thing coach Bill Belichick is doing to keep his franchise QB in tip top shape. ESPN reported that signing backup quarterback Cody Kessler is part of what Belichick referred to as \u201croster management.\u201d\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any doubt that Brady will play on Sunday when the Patriots take on the Buffalo Bills in New York. Even though the Pats have historically dominated Buffalo, the Bills are 3-0 and Brady isn\u2019t taking anything for granted.\n\n\"This will be the toughest game we've faced, and we're going to have to play a great game. To go on the road is tough, and certainly early in the game, after their pregame tailgate when they're a little fired up -- they're pretty loud. We've got to execute early. Starting fast, which we've actually done a good job with all year, is really important this week.\"\n\nTom Brady may play like someone 10 years younger, but he's still 42.
