And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $1 trillion over the next decade. Those projections stand in contrast to President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts, he would be able to eliminate the federal budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts.\n\nThe budget showed that revenue rose 4% in the 2019 budget year, which ended Sept. 30, but that spending surged at twice that rate. Spending increased for defense programs and for the government\u2019s big benefit programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Mnuchin argued that to put the budget on a sustainable path, Congress must enact proposals \u201cto cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.\u201d\n\nSo far, though, neither party has shown much interest in reducing the soaring deficits. Trump and Republicans seem content with the $1.5 trillion tax cut measure that Congress passed during Trump\u2019s first year in office. And Democrats who are running to oppose him in next year\u2019s election have proposed their own expensive spending plans, including Medicare for All.\n\nWhile pledging to protect Social Security and other benefit programs, many of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they will roll back Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations to pay for their programs. Against that backdrop, budget deficits are on track to keep rising \u2014 thereby raising the national debt, as a percentage of the economy, to its highest point since the end of World War II.\n\nThe government did previously run $1 trillion annual deficits from 2009 through 2012, when the Obama administration was spending heavily to combat the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the worst recession since the 1930s.\n\nThis time, the deficits are occurring at a dramatically different time: The unemployment rate is historically low, and the economy is in a record 11th year of expansion.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The increase stands in contrast to President Trump's campaign promises that he would be able to eliminate the deficit", "authors": ["Martin Crutsinger"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/us-budget-deficit-rises-984-billion.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
