(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nClemson, Alabama and Georgia have held down the top three spots in the Associated Press poll all season, in that order, with some combination of LSU, Ohio State and Oklahoma occupying Nos. 4 through 6. This is no way to run an interesting college football season.\n\nTime Game TV Noon Northwestern at No. 8 Wisconsin ABC Noon Texas Tech at No. 6 Oklahoma Fox Noon No. 23 Texas A&M vs. Arkansas in Arlington, Tex.

Northwestern, the Badgers\u2019 opponent Saturday, is the only team to accomplish that rare feat twice, in each of the past two seasons. Wisconsin might be able to get by even without the usual game from Taylor, however: The Badgers have allowed 14 points all season and lead the nation in scoring defense, total defense, rushing defense and passing efficiency defense. Northwestern has failed to score more than 10 points in two of its three games. Only seven teams average fewer passing yards per game, and no team has fewer scrimmage plays that have gone for at least 20 yards than the Wildcats, who have six. If the Badgers can crush an ostensibly good team such as Michigan, imagine what they can do against a team that has shown no sign of possessing a viable offense. \u2026\n\nTexas Tech will go into its annual track meet against Oklahoma without starting quarterback Alan Bowman, who\u2019s out with a shoulder injury. Both of his possible replacements aren\u2019t exactly compelling: Transfer Jackson Tyner wasn\u2019t particularly good at Rice, completing less than 50 percent of his passes, and Jett Duffey threw six interceptions and struggled to hold on to the ball when keeping it himself last season. Duffey did play well in relief work last year against the Sooners, with two touchdown passes and a touchdown run, but Coach Matt Wells said both will play Saturday.\n\nMidafternoon\n\nConsidering Coach Clay Helton\u2019s shaky grasp on his job entering the season and his team\u2019s quarterback woes, Southern California\u2019s 3-1 record might be the accomplishment of the season. To start, first-stringer JT Daniels suffered a torn ACL and meniscus in the Trojans\u2019 season opener against Fresno State. Then backup Kedon Slovis absorbed a big hit from Utah\u2019s Leki Fotu on the second play from scrimmage in last week\u2019s win and entered the concussion protocol, a status he remained at through late in the week. Enter junior Matt Fink, who entered the transfer portal at one point over the summer and reportedly was close to leaving for Illinois before deciding to stay with the Trojans. Fink threw for 351 yards and three touchdowns against the Utes and seems likely to make his first career start for USC at Washington, which features a coach who has thrived against Air Raid offenses such as the one commanded by Trojans first-year offensive coordinator Graham Harrell (a disciple of Washington State Coach Mike Leach). Huskies Coach Chris Petersen is 5-0 against Leach\u2019s Cougars during his time at Washington, winning by an average of 24 points and allowing just 13.8 points per game.\n\nThe late show\n\nThoughts and prayers go out to woeful Connecticut, which visits a likely salty Central Florida team coming off its first regular season loss since Thanksgiving weekend 2016. Last weekend, the Knights spotted Pittsburgh a 21-0 lead, scored the next 31 points but then lost on a last-minute trick play dubbed \u201cPitt Special.\u201d Saturday\u2019s game also is the final scheduled game of the Civil ConFLiCT series, a ludicrously contrived \u201crivalry\u201d (there\u2019s a trophy and everything) between wholly unconnected schools that will end when the Huskies leave the American Athletic Conference after this season. U-Conn. is so dreadful \u2014 quarterback Jack Zergiotis threw the ball 28 times but somehow gained only 90 yards through the air in last week\u2019s 35-point loss at Indiana \u2014 that Coach Randy Edsall already has begun the process of determining the players he\u2019s going to redshirt this season. A reminder: it\u2019s September. \u2026\n\nOhio State is only ranked fifth in the country but I\u2019m not sure anyone has been more dominant than the Buckeyes, who have won their four games by a combined 214-36. None of their first four opponents were much to speak of and three of the games were at home, however, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what Ohio State does at Nebraska. It\u2019s probably the biggest game in Lincoln in nearly a decade, and ESPN\u2019s \u201cCollege GameDay\u201d will be paying its first visit since 2007. But asking a Nebraska team that trailed middling Illinois for nearly the entire game last weekend to keep up with the rampaging Buckeyes is probably a bit of a stretch.\n\nRead more:\n\nReferee shot by cannon during college football game\n\nCollege football has Rivalry Week, Week Zero and now Redshirt Week\n\nAmid band drama, Iowa and Iowa State can\u2019t even agree whether rivalry game is in trouble\n\nUCLA-Washington State was a wild reminder: Really young people play football\n\nCollege football Week 4 winners and losers: Michigan is mashed, UCF\u2019s run ends", "description": "These are the games you need to watch.", "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel", "Reporter For The Early Lead", "September At Am", "Matt Bonesteel Spent The First Years Of His Washington Post Career Writing", "Editing.
