The $140 million lefty starts at home against Cardinals rookie Dakota Hudson.\n\nWashington hasn\u2019t put a baseball team in the World Series since 1933, when the Senators lost to the New York Giants in five games. The nation\u2019s capital owns one MLB championship; the Senators won all the way back in 1924. There wasn\u2019t even a baseball team at all in Washington for more than three decades until the Montreal Expos franchise moved to town before the 2005 season and was renamed the Nationals. Until this season, the Nats hadn\u2019t won a playoff series, going 0-4 since 2012.\n\nCOLE COUNTRY\n\nWith the Astros and Yankees tied 1-all, the best-of-seven AL Championship Series shifts to New York for Game 3. Houston ace Gerrit Cole, who is 18-0 with a 1.66 ERA in 24 starts since his last loss on May 22, pitches against Luis Severino.\n\nIn beating Tampa Bay in Games 2 and 5 of the Division Series, Cole allowed one run and six hits over 15 2/3 innings, striking out 25 and walking three. His winning streak is the longest by a pitcher in one year since Rube Marquard began 19-0 for the 1912 New York Giants, winning 18 of 19 starts and adding a victory in relief.\n\nCole, primed to become a prized free agent this fall, grew up in California rooting for the Yankees and was drafted by them 28th overall out of high school in 2008. He didn\u2019t sign and chose to attend UCLA instead, then was selected first overall by Pittsburgh in 2011.\n\nAt times he wondered what his career would have been like in pinstripes, especially when the Pirates were considering trades.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be dishonest and tell you that it didn\u2019t cross my mind. Obviously I got drafted by them, so I thought about it then,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all the rumors going around, it\u2019s kind of hard to control what you hear. But as of late it\u2019s just been not a thought at all.\u201d\n\nSTANTON\u2019S STATUS\n\nBefore setting their lineup for Game 3 against Houston, the Yankees must make a decision on outfielder Giancarlo Stanton. The slugger strained his right quadriceps in the series opener and missed Game 2.\n\nLimited by injuries to 18 games during the regular season, Stanton homered and singled in Game 1. If he were dropped from the roster against the Astros, he would be ineligible to return this year.\n\n\u201cIt is a sensitive decision, a tough decision,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just try and evaluate and try and get as honest as feedback as we can from Giancarlo.\u201d\n\nAaron Hicks could get his first start since Aug. 3, taking over in center field from Brett Gardner, who would replace Stanton in left. Sidelined by an injured flexor near his right elbow, Hicks pinch-hit for starting left fielder Cameron Maybin and grounded out leading off the 10th inning in Game 2, then moved to center.\n\n\u201cAaron is very much in play,\u201d Boone said.\n\nSILENT NIGHTS\n\nIf the Cardinals want to prevent a four-game sweep and get back into the NL Championship Series, their bats need to wake up fast.\n\nSt. Louis has all of two runs and 11 hits through three games and trails 3-0. Washington\u2019s three starters - An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg - have a combined ERA of 0.00. Strasburg took his turn quieting the Cardinals on Monday night, going seven innings in an 8-1 victory. He finished off each of his 12 strikeouts with an off-speed pitch.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t scored,\u201d said Cardinals slugger Paul Goldschmidt, who fanned four times in Game 3. \u201cWe haven\u2019t executed as an offense. I haven\u2019t really done anything this series, and the results speak for themselves, especially tonight. Just have to do a better job.\u201d\n\nDODGER BLUES\n\nAfter an agonizing playoff exit, Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman will be back next season.\n\nRoberts led the team to its seventh straight NL West title and a franchise-record 106 wins - second-most in the majors - but has been criticized for his pitching decisions in losing Game 5 of the Division Series to Washington. His in-game tactics during defeats in the 2017 and \u201818 World Series drew some disapproval, too.\n\nRoberts signed a contract extension through the 2022 season last November.\n\n\u201cWhen the season ends as abruptly as it did, and it\u2019s one of the more painful losses that I can remember, the whole thing is focusing on how we get to winning those 11 games in October,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cIn our mind Dave is absolutely a part of that.\u201d\n\nFriedman said he expects his own extension to be finalized in the next few days. His $35 million, five-year deal expires at the end of this month.\n\nPitching coach Rick Honeycutt, 65, will transition to a special assistant role next season, which would be his 15th with the Dodgers.\n\nCUBS CANDIDATES\n\nThe Chicago Cubs plan to interview former Philadelphia manager Gabe Kapler and Houston bench coach Joe Espada this week for their managerial opening.\n\nKapler was fired last week after going 161-163 in two years with the Phillies.\n\nThe Cubs are searching for a successor to Joe Maddon, whose contract expired after Chicago missed the playoffs this year for the first time since 2014. At least four other candidates have spoken with the Cubs about the job: Joe Girardi, Mark Loretta, David Ross and Will Venable.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A look at what's happening around the majors today:", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/nlcs_cardinals_nationals_baseball_76138_c0-122-2912-1820_s1200x700.jpg?437611272de35c638c09bf0a62282caf218b1392", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
