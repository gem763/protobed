Add San Diego to your travel bucket list.\n\nThe Southern California city offers incredible beach views in multiple areas, so if you're looking for some natural beauty that will take your breath away, these spots are for you.\n\nAnd the best part? They're all free.\n\nNo entrance or admission fees for these gorgeous views. You may need to pay a dollar or two for street parking for some of these locations, though, depending on where you park.\n\nOther than that, sit back and enjoy the view at these five places in and around San Diego:\n\nLa Jolla Cove\n\nView of La Jolla beach.

Walk along the sidewalk for a high-up perspective of the scenic view below or walk along the beach. There's also a railed walkway that takes you out into the middle of the water, another great photo opp \u2013 just be careful not to drop your phone or get wet from crashing waves!\n\nLa Jolla Beach.

These cliffs overlook the Pacific Ocean and offer an incredible view of the setting sun. Be sure to get there in time to snag a spot at the popular destination and in time for the sunset, of course. And the horizon isn't the only impressive view \u2013 the natural cliffs also provide a beautifully colored sun-soaked scene.\n\nMount Soledad\n\nMount Soledad.

Soledad National Veterans Memorial.\n\nWalk up the memorial's stairs to read the stories of American veterans and get a closer look at the cross, or walk around the perimeter of the spot to take in the incredible view.\n\nThere are are also several benches facing outward, so you can relax while looking out at the water and city below.\n\nMt. Helix Park\n\nView from Mt. Helix. (Photo: Courtesy of Callie Riley)\n\nMt. Helix Park is another hilltop spot that offers high-up views of San Diego, even though it's located outside the city itself in La Mesa, California.\n\nThe park also features a memorial cross you can take photos with, as well as picnic tables for lunches and the Yawkey Trail for walking along. The park's amphitheater is also home to events and other activities.\n\nMore: The SoCal beach towns you shouldn't miss between Los Angeles and San Diego\n\nMore: Sargassum seaweed, invader of Florida and Caribbean beaches, may be the 'new norm'\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/19/san-diego-california-best-free-views-beach-coastline/3932005002/", "description": "Add San Diego to your travel bucket list.
