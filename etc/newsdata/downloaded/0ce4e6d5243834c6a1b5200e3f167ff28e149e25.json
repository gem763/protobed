You\u2019re probably going to have to grind it out next year. That\u2019s just the way it is.\n\nThat\u2019s how Steve Cohen, the man behind the$15 billion hedge fund Point72 Asset Management, sees the run-up to the 2020 election playing out for investors.\n\nCohen was speaking at the Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York on Monday, according to Bloomberg. He was joined by fellow hedge-fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, who agreed the market is careening toward a volatile future.\n\nFor his part, Jones said that if Elizabeth Warren were to win the election, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.08% would drop by about 25% and economic growth in the U.S. would slip to 1% from estimates of more than 2% this year.\n\nCohen predicted Warren only need win the Democratic nomination for a double-digit drop in the stock market to take place, according to Bloomberg\u2019s report.\n\nCheck out: Building a secure retirement by creating a personal pension\n\nThe views of Cohen and Jones echo those of fellow Wall Street billionaires Rob Citrone and Leon Cooperman, in making bearish market forecasts should Warren\u2019s rise toward the White House continue.\n\nRead: Billionaire investor says market might not open if Warren wins\n\nJones told the audience that Warren\u2019s more centrist opponents, like Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, would also be a drag on the market, just not as severe.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, would boost the S&P 500 to 3,600, Jones estimated, which would be an 18% surge from the close of trading on Monday.\n\nAt last check, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.07% and the S&P 500 were mostly flat in Tuesday\u2019s session while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.59% was trading in negative territory.", "description": "The views of Steve Cohen and Paul Tudor Jones echo those of other big name Wall Street types, like Rob Citrone and Leon Cooperman, in making extremely...", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU251_cohen__ZG_20191029143628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
