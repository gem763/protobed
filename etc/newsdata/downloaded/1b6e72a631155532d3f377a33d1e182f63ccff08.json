But the new Eden is in the middle of Sweden, amid forests, farmhouses, hills and lakes, two-and-a-half hours by road west of Stockholm. It isn\u2019t exactly paradise, but it certainly comes close \u2013 and you get to drive a tractor.\n\nThe owner, Adam Arnesson, could do for farming what Greta Thunberg is doing for climate change. As I sit in the sun under a clear blue sky, on the terrace at the back of his wooden farmhouse, painted in the traditional deep red colour falu (laced with a pigment dug out of a copper mine), and gaze around at his fertile lands \u2013 a robot lawnmower is buzzing away placidly doing the mowing \u2013 I get to wondering if it isn\u2019t too late to stop being a journalist and become a farmer instead.\n\nThe ironic thing is that Arnesson didn\u2019t even set out to be a farmer. He thought he might do something with computers. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he says, serving up a pot of coffee and a plateful of chocolate. \u201cBut I knew that I didn\u2019t want to be a farmer. You go to these meetings and you read the farming magazines and it\u2019s depressing. Nothing but crisis. No future for young people.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut then he had an epiphany, when, aged 16, he came home one day to the farm where he was born in 1990 and realised it was no longer the farm he remembered growing up. His parents, Thomas and Berit, had more or less stopped farming. \u201cOur land had started to deteriorate,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was losing its diversity, the birds and butterflies were leaving and the forest was closing in. And I thought: I ought to take care of this land.\u201d\n\nArnesson left to study farming for three years at the Swedish Agricultural University. During his degree he started selling some of his farm products on Twitter. But the real revolution at the farm came in 2015, when he got in contact with Oatly, the Swedish plant-based milk company. There was a war going on at the time. The Milk War.\n\nThe Swedish Dairy Federation was suing Oatly for daring to describe their product as \u201cmilk\u201d. Milk comes from cows, they said, not oats. Technically, they won the case, but Oatly won a moral, strategic victory in getting their case for more sustainable farming in the public arena. And they acquired a new campaign slogan: \u201cIt\u2019s like milk but made for humans.\u201d They also angered traditional farmers, who felt under threat. Arnesson thought Oatly was \u201cprovocative\u201d, but that they were right to be. So much so, he tweeted: \u201cIf I was a dairy farmer with bad economy I would call up Oatly offering to plant all my land with Swedish high quality oats.\u201d\n\nFurious fellow farmers shot back, \u201cWhy don\u2019t YOU?!\u201d So that\u2019s what he did. It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, a meeting of minds, ethics, environmentalism, and capitalism, blended all together with vegan milk. Oat cuisine, Swedish-style. The joy of porridge.\n\nI wanted to create a more sustainable farm. My idea was that it was the same on the global scale. So that if everyone was to take small steps it would make a big difference\n\nArnesson\u2019s grandparents started subsistence farming here, in Jannelunds G\u00e5rd, outside \u00d6rebro, in 1960. It started as a dairy farm then became beef before going fully organic in 1995, acquiring the KRAV label from the Swedish soil association. Arnesson has turned the farm around to put the emphasis on cereals and pulses, but especially oats. \u201cYou have to start with where you are at \u2013 that\u2019s all you can do.\u201d A healthier planet, he argues, is built up gradually out of small incremental steps rather than born of a revolution.\n\nHe is completely non-evangelical but is all the more persuasive for it. He lets the farm do most of the talking. And the soil. If you look at soil that is conventionally farmed with chemical fertiliser with the same plants all the same height, \u201cit\u2019s just brown\u201d (as he puts it neatly). Whereas real soil is pulsing with life and insects. Arnesson doesn\u2019t mind getting his hands dirty, but it has to be good dirt.\n\n\u201cMy parents were very sceptical at first,\u201d says Arnesson. \u201cBut then they saw that it worked.\u201d When he first got in touch with Oatly, other Swedish farmers \u2013 and the farming press in Sweden \u2013 feared Oatly. \u201cWhen you criticise another farmer, it\u2019s seen as a lack of solidarity. But I liked Oatly. They were asking ethical questions about what we were doing.\u201d\n\nArnesson emailed Oatly in May 2015, saying that it would be \u201cfun\u201d to try and make the \u201ctransition\u201d away from dairy and towards plant-based. He was, he said, \u201csolution-focused\u201d. Carina Tollmar, director of sustainability at Oatly, replied the following morning, saying: \u201cWe have not been as concrete as you are in your thinking, and it would be really interesting to talk to you.\u201d They spoke on the phone and set up a meeting with Toni Petersson, the CEO, in Stockholm shortly after, and the rest is history. Arnesson\u2019s farm sells oats direct to Oatly and they turn those oats \u2013 using natural enzymes \u2013 into milk, yoghurt, ice cream and other good things.\n\nTo put my own cards on the table, I am a fan of Oatly, but will try not to shove it down anyone\u2019s throat (having said that, I sampled the Oatly \u201ccold brew latte\u201d in a can \u2013 100 per cent vegan \u2013 and, in my opinion, it\u2019s better than the non-vegan kind). It seems obvious that cows\u2019 milk really ought to be reserved for baby cows. Lactose-intolerance is normal.\n\nArnesson collaborated with Swedish Agricultural University food production scientist Dr Elin R\u00f6\u00f6s (also associated with the Food Climate Research Network at Oxford University). She did the theory \u2013 calculations about climate, emissions, biodiversity \u2013 and Arnesson put it all into practice. \u201cI wanted to create a more sustainable farm,\u201d he says. He could see that a lot of energy was going into the farm but only a small amount of food was coming out. \u201cMy idea was that it was the same on the global scale. So that if everyone was to take small steps it would make a big difference.\u201d\n\nHis simple step was to decrease the dependency of the farm on animals and increase \u201chuman food\u201d, cutting out the middle cow. \u201cWe could have more cows, more sheep. That\u2019s what most farmers are doing all over the world. But I didn\u2019t want to create a factory.\u201d At the more industrial end of farming, the three biggest meat producers are now producing more CO2 than the whole of France and nearly as much as oil companies, according to a recent report.\n\nArnesson started growing not just oats for Oatly, but rye for a local bakery, the Swedish grey pea (like chickpeas but grey), buckwheat, barley, alpine lentils and sunflower seeds. The effect was immediate. \u201cWhen we started out we could support 60 people with our food in one year [in terms of sheer calories]. In the following year, we could support nearly 200.\u201d Greenhouse gas emissions were cut in half (R\u00f6\u00f6s reckons the average diet of a single Swede produces two metric tons of CO2 per year; Arnesson brought it down to 0.72 of a ton). Moreover, the farm was more profitable than ever before and expanded to cover 100 hectares (250 acres). Thus proving that \u201cethical capitalism\u201d is not a total oxymoron.\n\nThis year has been their best yet, partly blessed by a good summer, with the right mix of sun and rain and not too hot. \u201cYou can actually see the difference,\u201d says Arnesson. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about numbers and charts. The birds and the butterflies are back.\u201d The other great thing, as Arnesson points out, is \u201cI don\u2019t have to get up quite so early in the morning to milk the cows.\u201d Oats don\u2019t need milking.\n\nJust as you can have heirloom tomatoes, so too you can have heirloom oats. Arnesson has specialised in ancient varieties (drawn from NordGen, which stores genetic material from agricultural plants and animals) that traditionally have done well in Sweden. \u201cSun oats\u201d are a very tall, very yellow plant growing to 1.5 or 1.6 metres tall (over 5 feet). \u201cNaked oats\u201d have no husk. I know. I pick up a few grains from the great vat where they are stored and have a good chew: sweet and nutty.\n\nArnesson is hoping to get Oatly to produce a special line of Naked Oatly. \u201cThe old varieties used to handle the heat better,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have more leaves to compete with wheat. And they have better root systems. Without fertiliser the roots go deeper in search of nutrients. Fertiliser only sits on the topsoil.\u201d He gives a shoutout to Hodmedod\u2019s in the UK for doing something similar. They are part of a network of like-minded, progressive, eco-aware farmers.\n\nYou can actually see the difference. It\u2019s not all about numbers and charts. The birds and the butterflies are back. I don\u2019t have to get up quite so early in the morning to milk the cows\n\nVegans and vegetarians may be disappointed to learn that Arnesson is neither. He eats meat once or twice a week. \u201cAnimals have their place here,\u201d he insists. He takes me to meet the pigs. Big old Herman the boar is in a field on his own. But Annie (four years old) and Reidun (an old Swedish name) and their brood are being very sociable. They come running up to us and try to nibble my boots and turn over so I can stroke their bellies. They look to me like very contented, cheerful pigs. As Arnesson says, he has \u201chigh animal welfare values: they mustn\u2019t be in a big barn where they never see the light\u201d. He has personally bottlefed one of the piglets. But the fact is that some of the young ones, when they turn two, will become bacon and sausages.\n\n\u201cThey have a purpose here,\u201d says Arnesson. \u201cThey\u2019re not just meat. Their main role is to kill the grass and to fertilise the soil.\u201d A year from now the field I am standing in communing with the pigs will be given over to oats. But I also have the impression that Arnesson feels that a farm wouldn\u2019t be complete \u2013 or sufficiently bio-diverse \u2013 without its fair (but very reduced) share of cows, pigs, sheep and hens. He quotes the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard: \u201cI\u2019d rather be a swineherd in Amagerbro and understood by pigs than a poet and misunderstood by people.\u201d\n\nArnesson is a philosopher of farming, the Obama of agriculture. He may have pushed back the forest but he still finds room for plenty of trees on his farm. He tries to include everyone in his vision and not set up one camp against another. He is pro-oats but not to the exclusion of all else. He disapproves of monoculture. It\u2019s a rainbow approach to agriculture, something he shares in common with Oatly. CEO of Oatly Petersson isn\u2019t vegan either. Neither is Michael Lee, their creative director. \u201cWe can\u2019t just appeal to urban hipsters and yoga bunnies,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if you\u2019re the biggest BBQ guy in the world, and you have steak for breakfast, it still makes a difference if you want to put plant-based milk in your coffee.\u201d\n\nThere is a distinctively Swedish style at work here. Swedes tend to work against the classic stereotypes of being tall and blond and Viking. They tend to focus on being sensible and moderate and accommodating. They are the opposite of hardline and dogmatic. But they also follow the science of climate change. The figures vary, but they don\u2019t lie. In the UK alone, plant-based milk produces somewhere between 70 and 75 per cent less CO2 than dairy. If you want to do something to improve the planet and make a dent in climate change, all you have to do is drink less cows\u2019 milk and eat less meat. It\u2019s actually pretty easy. And it\u2019s working: Oatly has seen an annual growth of over 30 per cent over the past five years. People drank 3 million litres of oat milk in 2001; last year it was 81 million.\n\n\u201cWe eat two or three times a day and we choose every time,\u201d says Arnesson. \u201cEveryone has the power to make a difference. In the end it comes down to the consumer. What farmers can do is limited by what consumers want and are prepared to pay for.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think farmers want to lock pigs up in a concrete jailhouse. \u201cThere is a better way.\u201d\n\nOther plant-based milks are available, but this vegetarian has a soft spot for Oatly\u2019s style of laid-back non-advertising, which doesn\u2019t really try to twist your arm but just gets you thinking. When I was in New York recently I noticed the following poster on the back of a bus: \u201cThe most popular oat milk ads are the ones that drive away and leave you alone.\u201d\n\nYou can read the Oatly sustainability report here\n\nAndy Martin is the author of \u2018With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher\u2019, published by Polity", "description": "Nobody knows where the old Garden of Eden was.
