The area is also thickly forested.\n\nLinda is hoping that Amelia, a former student at Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College, got \"lost on her way back\" and the search party will be able to find her.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nAmelia's sister Georgie, 19, said she is close to her sister and that Amelia would message the family whenever she had wifi.\n\nGeorgie said: \"She is strong minded, really sensible and very organised.\n\n\"She spent the last year Googling solo female travelling, looking at pages and blogs and sorting out everything.\n\n\"I'm just in shock. She has never done anything like this before.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n\"I spoke to her on Wednesday and she normally messages us every now and then, every time she got wifi.\n\n\"I told her to put loads of pictures online to see what she was up to.\n\n\"It's horrendous but we need to be positive and she needs to be found.\"\n\nAmelia left the UK last month after completing an apprenticeship. It is her first time travelling on her own.\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\n(Image: ViralPress)\n\nRyan Harris, 18, who was part of the group travelling Cambodia with the 21-year-old, raised the alarm. He had moved onto another island with plans to meet back up with Amelia.\n\nA Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: \"We are assisting the family of a British woman who has been reported missing in Cambodia and are in close contact with the Cambodian police.\"", "description": "Amelia Bambridge, 21, from Worthing, West Sussex, has not been seen since she left a beach party on the popular tourist destination in the early hours of Thursday morning", "authors": ["Lorraine King", "Image", "Pa", "Viralpress", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734675.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Amelia-Bambridge-missing.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
