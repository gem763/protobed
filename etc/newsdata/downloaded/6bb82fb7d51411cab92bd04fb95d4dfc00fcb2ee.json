That is 10 more than the 46 House bills that have become law this year.\n\nIt\u2019s far from a subpoena record, but it is complicating Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s attempt to portray her troops as focused on their agenda.\n\nPerhaps more worrying to Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s cause is the conclusion of a former senior oversight attorney for the House, who said the spate of subpoenas issued this month as part of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry is illegal.\n\nSamuel Dewey, a lawyer at McDermott Will & Emery who used to lead investigations for the House Financial Services Committee, said the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, is not authorized under the rules to lead an impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cUnless there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that\u2019s not public, which would in itself be extraordinary, there is no way he has jurisdiction to conduct an impeachment inquiry. I think his proceeding is illegal,\u201d Mr. Dewey said.\n\nMr. Schiff\u2019s impeachment inquiry subpoenas have all centered around Mr. Trump\u2019s attempts to rope Ukraine into investigating a potential political opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. The Washington Times counts 15 publicly acknowledged subpoenas issued on the Ukraine matter so far, including the one Tuesday to Mr. Taylor.\n\nThe House also has approved 22 subpoenas related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling and Trump campaign behavior in 2016, seven subpoenas dealing with the president\u2019s finances, three concerning White House matters such as security clearances or the activities of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, five subpoenas over immigration policy, three over Mr. Trump\u2019s now-abandoned attempt to ask about citizenship on the 2020 census, and one subpoena to the State Department over U.S. policy in Afghanistan.\n\nThose are publicly acknowledged subpoenas that have been approved or for which chairmen have given notice. Other subpoenas may have been sent in secret, which would mean the ratio of subpoenas to bills could be even higher.\n\n\u201cThis is becoming a do-nothing Congress, and it will ultimately cost them the majority in 2020,\u201d said Corey Lewandowski, a confidant of Mr. Trump and the target of one of the 56 subpoenas, sent in August.\n\nMr. Lewandowski questioned the way Democrats went about calling him. He said it seemed more about confrontation than getting information.\n\nHis subpoena was issued even though his attorney told the House Judiciary Committee that he was willing to testify voluntarily \u2014 as he had already done for two other committees. But Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York issued a subpoena anyway. Mr. Lewandowski said he learned about it first from a reporter, hours before his own attorney received notice from the committee.\n\n\u201cPerhaps they wanted to make it a media story,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that the hearing itself was for show.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that the subpoena was issued the same day Mr. Trump was traveling to New Hampshire, where he all but endorsed a potential U.S. Senate bid for Mr. Lewandowski.\n\nHe also said the committee treated him differently than Mr. Mueller, who, unlike Mr. Lewandowski, demanded to be subpoenaed.\n\nWhen during his July hearing a lawmaker asked Mr. Mueller to read parts of his report and he declined, the committee accepted that. When Mr. Lewandowski was asked and tried to decline, he was castigated.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to be treated the same,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they did that.\u201d\n\nMr. Lewandowski said he doesn\u2019t question the legality of his subpoena. By that point, Mr. Nadler was arguing to the courts that he was engaged in an impeachment inquiry and had received his committee\u2019s approval for 18 subpoenas related to the Russia investigation.\n\nThat probe petered out after Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s testimony.\n\nNow the focus is on Ukraine, and Mr. Nadler\u2019s committee has been sidelined.\n\nThe Washington Times reached out to staff for Mr. Nadler\u2019s committee and three others responsible for almost all of the subpoenas. None of them responded.\n\nBut Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, a Virginia Democrat and senior member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, challenged The Times\u2019 comparison of laws to subpoenas. He said the House can issue the subpoenas on its own but needs cooperation from the Republican-led Senate and Mr. Trump to write legislation.\n\nHe said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, is refusing to pass Democrats\u2019 bills, hurting their legislative record.\n\n\u201cSomething becomes law when both parties vote for it. And we\u2019ve passed easily 100 pieces of legislation waiting at the grim reaper\u2019s \u2014 Mitch McConnell \u2014 desk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got at least 100 more ready to go. They won\u2019t bring it up.\u201d\n\nThe House is on a good pace with 46 bills signed into law. Eight years ago, when Democrats controlled the White House and Senate and Republicans led the lower chamber, the House had written 32 bills signed into law at this point.\n\nIn 1995, when Republicans took both houses of Congress under a Democratic president, just 23 House bills were signed into law by this point.\n\nMrs. Pelosi\u2019s tally this year is inflated by nine ceremonial pieces of legislation, such as renaming post offices. Even among the substantive bills, many are tweaks or extensions to current law, leaving few marquee accomplishments.\n\nMr. Connolly said whatever the ratio, the House is well behind Republicans in terms of subpoena records. When Republicans controlled the House and Barack Obama was in the White House, he said, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee alone fired off \u201cwell over 100 subpoenas.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1990s, when President Clinton was in office, Rep. Dan Burton sent out more than 1,000, including one notorious incident in which he sent a subpoena to the wrong person because he confused two people with similar Asian surnames.\n\nBut Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the oversight committee, said the subpoena numbers summed up Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been saying this. When the Democrats are completely focused on attacking the president, it\u2019s tough to do what\u2019s best for the country,\u201d he told The Times.\n\nMr. Dewey, the former House attorney, indicated that Democrats have been more publicly confrontational in their approach to subpoenas than past congresses.\n\nHe said his own usual approach was to make a voluntary request to a target for documents or testimony and try to reach accommodations with those who resisted. Only after that failed would a subpoena be necessary, he said. He also said he worked with his counterparts in the other party, notifying them when subpoenas were issued.\n\n\u201cHonestly, if you\u2019re cutting corners on procedure, my experience is you\u2019re hiding something or you\u2019re just lazy,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Dewey said Democrats could face a legal challenge over any impeachment-related subpoenas because the House has yet to vote to authorize an inquiry. Mrs. Pelosi created an inquiry by proclamation, turning the reins over to Mr. Schiff. Mr. Nadler, meanwhile, has argued to the courts that he has been in the midst of an inquiry for months.\n\nMr. Dewey said those arguments aren\u2019t frivolous, but \u201cI think they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think as a matter of law that the Judiciary Committee can exercise the impeachment power without a vote of the full House,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think independently of that, I do not think any other committee can exercise the impeachment power.\u201d\n\nHe said that could be an argument Mr. Trump\u2019s team could make to defy some of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the defense to a subpoena,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that you would have a way to challenge it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
