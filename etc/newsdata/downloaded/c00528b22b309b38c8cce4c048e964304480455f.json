Trust me, I\u2019m not worth the energy, nobody should be worth that energy! \u2014 Hailey Bieber (@haileybieber) October 7, 2019\n\nAs many of Swift\u2019s fans pointed out, Bieber and Swift haven\u2019t always seen eye-to-eye in the past.\n\nUpon learning in June that Bieber\u2019s manager Scooter Braun had acquired Swift\u2019s music catalogue, the singer expressed disdain for Braun, claiming that he used Bieber and on-and-off client Kanye West to bully her on social media.\n\nTo illustrate her point, Swift also shared a screenshot from Bieber\u2019s Instagram account of an August 2016 post, in which he shared a FaceTime call between himself and Braun \u2014 who can be seen with West. \u201cTaylor swift what up,\u201d Bieber captioned the post.\n\nIn response, Bieber apologized for his \u201cdistasteful and insensitive\u201d post, writing that \u201cat the time I thought it was funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the years have passed we haven\u2019t crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts or frustrations,\u201d Bieber wrote. \u201cSo for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on Scooter isn\u2019t fair. What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter.\u201d", "description": "Justin Bieber Reenacts Taylor Swift\u2019s Banana Freakout", "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Umrwy2qEDwIC5qbIt4zzfw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/d689094c09b54e45d647bd7b5a2dda30", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
