Christopher Moran explains that while in the past that has traditionally meant the company\u2019s in-house VC sought out later-stage investments in companies with more \u201cmature\u201d technology, the fund recently shifted its focus to early-stage companies.\n\n\u201c[Lockheed\u2019s venture arm] was actually established in 2007, as a fund called the \u2018Emerging Technologies Funds,\u201d Moran said in an interview. \u201cAnd it was a vehicle for the business areas to look for and find small startups [\u2026] They were using it to look for sort of leading edge, but more mature technology. We started realizing that what we wanted to do was focus more on commercial tech, with a dual-use capability for aerospace, then that made us think that we should probably be looking at much earlier stage companies.\u201d\n\nAerospace has always spun out dual-use technologies like GPS and satellite imaging, but today\u2019s startups are solving larger problems; autonomous technologies like machine learning, computer vision, neural networks and artificial intelligence have tremendous potential for application in Lockheed\u2019s aerospace and defense businesses \u2014 but most of the startups working on these challenges are geared towards automakers and mobility, since they offer a clearer and more immediate path to revenue.\n\nMoran accordingly shifted the focus of the fund, aiming its investments at much earlier stage companies, and looking instead for leading edge or \u201cvisionary\u201d startups. Once identified, they look to establish partnerships with areas of Lockheed\u2019s business to help inform the startups\u2019 work at an earlier stage in the process.\n\nLockheed Martin Ventures now has $200 million committed, and Moran says it has returned around $80 million on its first $100 million invested already in its first decade of operation. It\u2019s an \u2018evergreen\u2019 fund by design, meaning that returns generated by the fund go back into funding more startups through the venture wing exclusively.", "description": "In niche markets like aerospace, where the traditional VC model might not yield an abundance of available funding, corporate venture funds can offer entrepreneurs an interesting alternative.
