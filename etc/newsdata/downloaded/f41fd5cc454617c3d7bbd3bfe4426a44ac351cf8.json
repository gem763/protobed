As Boris Johnson heads to Brussels for a crucial 2-day summit, the DUP have made his trip much trickier.\n\nThe Northern Ireland party issued a statement this morning stating they \u2018cannot support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues\u2019 and that there is \u2018a lack of clarity on VAT\u2019. That means either Johnson needs to compromise further, the EU needs to accept the DUP\u2019s demands, or the DUP themselves need to back down. The party did end its statement claiming it will \u2018continue to work with the Government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland\u2019, so progress is still possible. It just might need an extension to allow a deal to blossom.\n\nFirmly strapped onto the Brexit roller coaster, the pound tumbled following the DUP\u2019s comments, shedding 0.4% against and alike. That fall keeps the gains from this week intact, but takes it from yesterday\u2019s fresh 5-month highs. Not that sterling will necessarily remain in the red; it opened in much the same way on Wednesday, only to end the session up thanks to the positive \u2013 but clearly not positive enough \u2013 Brexit chatter.\n\nLike with Tuesday\u2019s and Wednesday\u2019s figures, it is hard to see the latest UK reading meaning much to the pound. Nevertheless, it is expected to rise from -0.2% to -0.1% month-on-month.\n\nDespite the pound being in an emotionally unstable place, the was unable to capitalise on the currency\u2019s losses, instead starting Thursday flat at 7170. This as the Eurozone indices saw a muted open, with the and slipping 0.1% and 0.3% respectively.\n\nDisclaimer: Spreadex provides an execution only service and the comments above do not constitute (or should not be construed as constituting) investment advice or recommendations, or a record of our trading prices, or an offer of, or solicitation for, a transaction in any financial instrument.
