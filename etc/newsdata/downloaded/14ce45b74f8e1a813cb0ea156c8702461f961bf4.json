But hey, at least everyone would\u2019ve been united on something on 31 October, before Boris Johnson moved the deadline again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, David and Matt, you have a hell of a lot of making up to do if there\u2019s even a thought that this show could get legs again.\n\nWe\u2019ve come too far as a country to step back into the world of \u2018I\u2019m a Lady\u2019 (Picture: BBC)\n\nPreviously speaking about any potential reunion to the Big Issue, Matt admitted he was aware and embarrassed of the show\u2019s controversial characters.\n\n\u2018If I could go back and do Little Britain again, I wouldn\u2019t make those jokes about transvestites,\u2019 he told the mag. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t play black characters.\n\n\u2018Basically, I wouldn\u2019t make that show now. It would upset people. We made a more cruel kind of comedy than I\u2019d do now.\u2019\n\n\u2018Society has moved on a lot since then and my own views have evolved,\u2019 he added. \u2018There was no bad intent there \u2013 the only thing you could accuse us of was greed.\u2019\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s not the greatest start in the world that all the show\u2019s tired clich\u00e9s seem ready to be wheeled out for listeners once again \u2013 the only gay in the village Dafydd, gobby working class benefit scrounger Vicky Pollard, Fat Fighters\u2019 Marjorie Dawes, and, you guessed it, Emily \u2018I\u2019m A Lady\u2019 Howard.\n\nFor someone who\u2019s only just said that character has died a death, especially in the 13 years of societal growth the UK has been through since it last aired on TV, what on earth possessed them to bring, of all people, Emily back.\n\nVicky Pollard will be revisited in the radio special (Picture: BBC)\n\nAt least on the radio the pair don\u2019t have to run the risk of falling into old habits and wearing fat-suits and blackface in a bid to get a laugh (both of which are present and correct in Walliams\u2019 Desiree in Little Britain.) Though you have to kind of wonder what it is they\u2019re going to be talking about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a character like council estate Vicky around, and the stereotypical trope she often falls into, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to hear some pro-Brexit, anti-immigrant nonsense she doesn\u2019t understand coming out of her mouth when she\u2019s not watching Love Island, we assume.\n\nWhy do you think Britain should leave the EU? Yeah but, no but, yeah but, no but\u2026\n\n(While that sounds like I\u2019m the one being offensive, this was a character that was displayed wheeling around six kids in an extended trolley, before trading one in for a Westlife CD and exchanging sexual favours for electronic equipment.)\n\nAnd what is \u2018rubbish transvestite\u2019 Emily (their words not mine) without the screeches of \u2018I\u2019m a Lady\u2019 defining every sentence? With the sexual revolution upon us, is Dafydd going to remain the Only Gay In The Village\u2122? Or, god forbid, decide that seeing as everyone else was gay, he was going to be sexually liberated in some other way, and preach that to the masses.\n\nWe\u2019re sure Dafydd will have some thoughts on Brexit (Picture: BBC)\n\nPlease, please don\u2019t be these people you two. You need to be better than what is currently running through mine and hundreds of other peoples\u2019 heads right now.\n\nBy all means, share both sides of the Leave/Remain coin, and do it well. Don\u2019t resort to cheap, mocking that by your own words was \u2018cruel\u2019 even 13 years ago.\n\nIn the years that have passed both Lucas and Walliams have become household names in their own right. Not only that, family friendly names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is despite their follow-up show, Come Fly With Me, featuring them in blackface, brownface yellowface. They\u2019ve somehow managed to have that smited from their record in favour of children\u2019s books and Britain\u2019s Got Talent.\n\nMore: Brexit Boris Johnson welcomes back 10 MPs who rebelled against him EU citizens and 16-year-olds will not be allowed to vote in December election How to register to vote as Boris Johnson attempts to secure General Election\n\nBut the very pinnacle of the show and what it\u2019s based on is terrifying, and leaves so much room for error you can\u2019t help but feel that something is about to go seriously wrong.\n\nYou guys have a short period of time to autocorrect years of offensive sketches that have marked British culture.\n\nI wish you the best, but can\u2019t help but think this is a bit of a thankless venture.\n\nLittle Brexit airs Thursday at 6.30pm on BBC Radio 4.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
