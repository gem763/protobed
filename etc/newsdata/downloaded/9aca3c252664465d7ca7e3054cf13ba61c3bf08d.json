She added that the Obama administration never asked her to help with the Clinton campaign or work against the Trump campaign, \"nor would I have taken any such steps if they had.\"\n\nYovanovitch said she had never met with Hunter Biden and had only met briefly with Giuliani.\n\n\"I do not know Mr. Giuliani's motives for attacking me. But individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\" Yovanovitch said.\n\nYovanovitch's testimony comes a day after two foreign-born men who helped Giuliani in his efforts to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden were arrested on federal campaign finance charges, with prosecutors describing a sprawling effort to funnel foreign money into the American political process at the behest of Ukrainian officials.\n\nShe concluded by expressing \"deep disappointment and dismay\" she felt as the events in Ukraine unfolded, including her removal. She also said the State Department is being \"hollowed out and attacked from within.\"\n\n\"We need to rebuild diplomacy as the first resort to advance America's interests and the front line of America's defense. I fear that not doing so will harm our nation's interest, perhaps irreparably,\" Yovanovitch warned. She also expressed concern that bad actors in foreign countries will \"see how easy it is to use fiction and innuendo to manipulate our system.\"\n\n\"Our efforts were intended, and evidently succeeded, in thwarting corrupt interests in Ukraine, who fought back by selling baseless conspiracy theories to anyone who would listen. Sadly, someone was listening, and our nation is the worse off for that,\" Yovanovitch concluded.\n\nYovanovitch is providing her deposition behind closed doors.", "description": "Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch said in her prepared remarks that she was \"incredulous\" that she had been removed as ambassador based \"on unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\"", "authors": ["Grace Segers", "Grace Segers Is A Politics Reporter For Cbs News Digital."], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/11/a0db63f0-2ff4-46e5-9493-88ecd942a74e/thumbnail/1200x630g2/4fef0571f78b324f3d6c749761990c34/gettyimages-1180430419.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
