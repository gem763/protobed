Ozil - the new Hatem Ben Arfa\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nWhen Emery was in charge of Paris Saint-Germain, he ostracised a supremely talented but unreliable wayward creator.\n\nThat, ultimately, led to Hatem Ben Arfa taking PSG to court.\n\nNow Emery has appeared to sideline World Cup winner Mesut Ozil, who has been training and, seemingly, is fully fit and available.\n\nOzil hasn\u2019t been seen since the Carabao Cup win over Nottingham Forest and has played just 142 minutes this term.\n\nOf course, it won\u2019t just be Emery\u2019s call to effectively freeze out the club\u2019s biggest earner; those above Emery will almost certainly be in agreement.\n\nBut, surely having Ozil on the bench would have been a good option for the Spaniard.\n\nThe sight of Lucas Torreira playing as the No.10 in the second half won\u2019t have done anything to appease the section of the crowd chanting the German\u2019s name.\n\n2. Edwards impresses on north London return\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIf you ask them now, Mauricio Pochettino and Marcus Edwards probably both regret the Tottenham manager\u2019s likening his then-fledgling prospect to Lionel Messi in 2016.\n\nEdwards was tipped to start for Spurs, one of English football\u2019s brightest young prospects then.\n\nThree years on, after a failed loan spell at Norwich (one appearance) and a temporary stay at Excelsior Rotterdam (who were relegated), Edwards is now moving forwards at Vitoria, whom he joined in September on a four-year deal.\n\nThis was just the Camden kid\u2019s fourth appearance for the Portuguese side, but the 20 year-old showed enough here with his goal - his second for the side - and some fine touches to suggest that he can enjoy an impressive season with them, and then make forward strides once more.\n\n3. Maitland-Niles misses his mark\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nAinsley Maitland-Niles has more often than not operated as a fullback under Emery.\n\nHector Bellerin\u2019s injury offered him first-team opportunities last term and he grabbed them with both hands.\n\nBut after a difficult start this season he\u2019s lost the spot as first reserve to Bellerin to Calum Chambers - and has been quick to point out that he prefers to play further forward anyway.\n\nTonight he got the chance to start in midfield - and was bitterly disappointing.\n\nSloppy in possession, he took too many touches when on for two would suffice and failed to have any real positive impact.\n\nWith Arsenal 2-1 down, it was unsurprising to see him hooked at the break.\n\n4. Promising signs from Pepe\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Everything is new for him, in the last two or three games, I think he's improved a lot of things,\" said Granit Xhaka in his programme notes.\n\n\"He's working hard, in defence as well. Maybe at the moment he just needs a bit of luck.\"\n\nThe Arsenal captain is certain the \u00a372million winger just needs time to adapt and will come good for the Gunners and the signs in his second-half cameo certainly suggest as much.\n\nThe Ivorian produced a wonderful freekick from distance to level the scores at 2-2.\n\nHe produced a better one to win it with virtually the last kick.\n\nHis arrival injected some dynamism into the Arsenal attack. At his best, he can be a real difference-maker, someone who can beat a man and lead a counter - as well as being able to pick a clever pass.\n\nThis was a promising display that, you hope, he can build upon.\n\n5. Unai Emery still not getting things right\n\n(Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\nThe Arsenal boss had the opportunity to experiment with his first XI this Thursday; bring the hungry players in out of the cold, try a new formation etc.\n\nHe did that for the most part, giving the likes of Lucas Torreira and Emile Smith-Rowe a rare run-out, but apparently learnt very little about his side.\n\nArsenal were their usual sloppy selves in defence, the fringe players - Gabriel Martinelli aside - did little to prove they're hungry for a regular place in the first team, and the Gunners were largely second best.\n\nFans are starting to get on Emery's back now too - one supporter even had an Emery Out sign, while others sang the name of the ostracized Mesut Ozil.\n\nThe win will paper over the cracks for now, but Emery needs to start getting things right soon.", "description": "Record signing Nicolas Pepe stepped from the bench and scored two late freekicks to secure victory for Arsenal", "authors": ["Alex Richards", "Image", "Reuters", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20719019.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Vitoria-Guimaraes-Group-F-UEFA-Europa-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
