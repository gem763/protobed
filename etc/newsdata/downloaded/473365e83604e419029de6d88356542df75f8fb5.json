You should have called me the first time this happened.\"", "description": "Rebekah Vardy could earn a fortune from her Instagram after Coleen Rooney unmasked her account as the leaky source who had been selling stories to the press", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Aaron Parfitt", "Splashnews.Com", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566099.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Pride-Of-Sport-Awards-2018-Red-Carpet-Arrivals.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
