A lot of markets that really aren't doing well. Even Europe was up nearly double-digits for us as well,\" he said.\n\nHoneywell is a multinational company that makes a range of goods, including home products for consumers, automation software for warehouses and construction technology focused on energy efficiency. The company is valued at $120 billion, and the shares have gained 27% this year. The company topped EPS expectations when it reported third-quarter earnings last week, and it raised the lower end of its full-year 2019 earnings forecast. Revenue did come up short, however, at $9.086 billion versus the $9.12 billion analysts polled by FactSet were expecting, and profit fell by 30% as the company sold off some of its businesses last year. The company also lowered the top-end of its full-year sales forecast. But Adamczyk said the global environment is strong. \"Overall we're actually not seeing the softening of this environment, and actually I was very pleased with the bookings, which is really a predictor of our future,\" he said. Despite the global scope of the company, Adamczyk said it focuses on local supply chains and has managed to navigate the imposition of tariffs well. But he said that he would like \"to have a fair trade resolution between China and the U.S.\"\n\nTrade war", "description": "Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk says the company is seeing strength in areas of the market that aren't doing so well.", "authors": ["Pippa Stevens"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105293193-1529952569074rts1fw5u.jpg?v=1536701905", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
