These will take time to heal,\u201d Lam said in an opinion piece in the New York Times.\n\n\u201cBut it remains this government\u2019s hope that conversation will triumph over conflict and that through its actions, calm can be restored and trust can be rebuilt within the community.\u201d\n\nBut resident Poon Yau-lok, 62, was sceptical that the talks would make any difference.\n\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t listen when 200,000 people marched on the street. Why would they listen to just 150?\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nWhat started as protests over a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial have evolved into broader calls for greater democracy, among other demands.\n\nThere has been violent unrest in parts of the former British colony over the last three months, but life for most people goes on as normal most of the time.\n\nThe protests have taken a heavy toll on some businesses as tourists stay away. Cathay Pacific (0293.HK), the city\u2019s flagship carrier, has been the biggest corporate casualty after China demanded it suspend staff involved in the protests.\n\nCathay CEO Rupert Hogg and Chairman John Slosar have since left the company.\n\nRail operator MTR Corp (0066.HK) has also suffered, with passenger numbers on the high-speed rail link to mainland China plunging 30% to 1.14 million people in August from July.\n\nPassengers on the Airport Express, which links the city to the airport where protesters have disrupted operations, were down 10% over the same period to 1.3 million people.\n\nThe MTR has at times suspended city rail services during the protests, preventing some demonstrators from gathering and making it a target of attack, with protesters vandalising stations and setting fires near some exits.\n\nThe rail operator halted services at Sha Tin station on Wednesday night after protesters vandalised facilities there for a second time since the weekend.\n\nTrain services resumed on Thursday.\n\nThe protesters are also angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nChina says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest.\n\nHong Kong is on edge ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic on Oct. 1, with authorities eager to avoid scenes that could embarrass the central government in Beijing.\n\nThe Asian financial hub also marks the fifth anniversary this weekend of the start of the \u201cUmbrella\u201d protests, a series of pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014 that failed to wrestle concessions from Beijing.", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam will hold her first talks with the public on Thursday in a bid to resolve a political crisis that has fuelled nearly four months of sometimes violent protests and plunged the Chinese-run city into chaos.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433978016&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P042", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
