Its former Kurdish allies immediately forged a new alliance with Assad's government, inviting the army into towns across the breadth of their territory.\n\nA Reuters cameraman on the Turkish frontier reported heavy bombardment on Tuesday morning of the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain where an SDF spokesman reported a fierce battle going on.\n\nU.S. military aircraft carried out a \"show of force\" in Syria after Turkish-backed fighters came in close proximity to American forces during the Turkish offensive, a U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nThe official said U.S. military aircraft were flown over the area after troops in northeastern Syria felt the Turkish-backed fighters were too close. The Turkish-backed fighters dispersed after the show of force, the official said.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence will meet Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara, where he will urge Turkey to reach an immediate ceasefire in Syria and to work towards a negotiated settlement.\n\n\"Vice President Pence will reiterate President Trump's commitment to maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nTrump announced a set of sanctions on Monday to punish Ankara, and on Tuesday a senior Trump administration official said Washington would threaten more sanctions to persuade Turkey to reach a ceasefire and halt its offensive.\n\nThe measures announced on Monday - mainly a hike in steel tariffs and a pause in trade talks - were less robust than financial markets had anticipated, and Trump's critics derided them as too feeble to have an impact.\n\nThe Turkish lira, which had fallen on the expectation of tougher U.S. measures, recovered after the sanctions were announced, as did its bond and stock markets, with traders noting that Trump had spared Turkish banks.\n\nBilateral trade between Turkey and the United States is relatively small - around a tenth the size of Turkey's trade with Europe. Washington's most effective form of economic leverage would be to hinder Turkey's access to U.S. financial markets, a step Trump has so far avoided.\n\nIn a potentially more damaging blow, German carmaker Volkswagen said it was postponing a final decision on whether to build a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) plant in Turkey, citing concern over \"current developments\" after international condemnation of the incursion.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, the U.S. Treasury said on Monday it had sanctioned Turkey's energy, defence and interior ministers, as well as the ministries of energy and defense.\n\nACCUSATIONS OF BETRAYAL\n\nTrump has defended his reversal of U.S. policy as part of a plan to extricate the United States from \"endless\" wars in the Middle East.\n\nBut his critics, including senior figures in his own Republican Party, cast it as a betrayal of the Kurds, loyal allies who lost thousands of fighters as the principal ground forces in Washington's battle against Islamic State.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG militia, the key component of the forces who fought Islamic State, is seen by Ankara as a terrorist group aligned with Kurdish separatist insurgents in Turkey.\n\nTurkey says it aims to defeat the YPG and create a \"safe zone\" where millions of Syrian war refugees now in Turkey could be resettled.\n\nThe United Nations says 160,000 people have fled their homes as Turkish forces advance. The regional Kurdish administration puts the number of displaced at 270,000.\n\nThe U.N. Security Council will likely meet on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in Syria, diplomats said, the second such session since Turkey began its offensive.\n\nThe U.N. Human Rights office said on Tuesday that Turkey could be held responsible for war crimes by fighters under its direction, potentially including the assassination of Hevrin Khalaf, a leading Kurdish politician killed on the side of a highway on Saturday by gunmen who posted the incident on the Internet.\n\nTurkish-backed fighters have denied blame for her murder.\n\nErdogan, who has pledged to continue military operations come what may, said Ankara was giving the world a chance to bring peace to the region.\n\n\"The international community missed its opportunity to prevent the Syrian crisis from pulling an entire region into a maelstrom of instability,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal.\"The European Union - and the world - should support what Turkey is trying to do.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Turkey pressed ahead with its offensive in northern Syria on Tuesday despite U.S. sanctions and growing calls for it to stop, while Syria's Russia-backed army moved on the key city of Manbij that was abandoned by U.S. forces.
