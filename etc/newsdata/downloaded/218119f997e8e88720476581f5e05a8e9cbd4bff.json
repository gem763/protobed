Don't be up in arms, the gates will be opened when the time comes,' he said.\n\n'You have money, you are strong but when 100, 200 people go to Greece by sea, you rush to the phone,' Erdogan complained.\n\n'Look here, there are four million people. You do not say anything about this.'\n\nWarning: Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan (pictured during a speech in Ankara today) said the 'gates to Europe' will be opened to Syrian refugees 'when the time comes'\n\nHardware: Turkish soldiers in military vehicles return from the border town of Tal Abyad in northern Syria today as Ankara repeated its threats to 'crush' Kurdish fighters\n\nPoised: A military vehicle with two Turkish flags lies in wait on the Syrian border as Ankara warned it was ready to 'neutralise' Kurdish fighters if necessary\n\nKurdish fighters claim Turkey has launched new offensive Kurdish fighters in Syria say Turkey has resumed its military onslaught today despite a fragile truce agreed with Russia. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Turkey and its rebel allies had launched a large ground offensive against three villages today and forces thousands of civilians to flee. Calling on the U.S. to intervene and protect them, the Kurds warned they would exercise their 'right to self-defence' in the disputed border zone. SDF commander Mazloum Abdi on Twitter accused the Turkish-led forces of violating the truce on the eastern front of Ras al-Ain. 'The guarantors of the ceasefire must carry out their responsibilities to rein in the Turks,' he added on Twitter. Turkey has given the Kurds 150 hours to withdraw from the zone, escorted by Russian and Syrian troops.\n\nErdogan has helped to guard Europe's borders since a deal struck with the EU in 2016 but has repeatedly threatened to throw that door open since then.\n\nAround a million Syrians moved to Germany at the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and the influx has caused a series of political headaches for Angela Merkel ever since.\n\nTurkey has said it hopes to resettle more than a quarter of its Syrian refugees in the former Kurdish territory.\n\nToday Russian and Syrian forces were deploying across the border zone where they are tasked with assisting the 'removal' of Kurdish fighters and their weapons.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the Kurdish-led SDF had pulled out of some areas at the eastern end of the border on Thursday.\n\n'The SDF have withdrawn from positions between Derbasiyeh and Amuda in the Hasakeh countryside,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based war monitor.\n\nFighters of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) - the main component of the SDF - remained in numerous positions across the 275-mile border, he added.\n\nThe Observatory also reported clashes near the town of Tal Tamr between SDF fighters and some of the Syrian former rebels paid by Turkey to fight ground battles.\n\nKurdish fighters said Turkey had launched a new ground offensive against three border villages which they said forced thousands of civilians to flee.\n\nIn addition, there were reports of Turkish attacks on Syrian government troops in the tinderbox border zone.\n\nReady and waiting: A man cycles past a Turkish military vehicle near the Turkish-Syrian border today\n\nPatrols: A Russian military policeman outside an armoured vehicle in the city of Kobane today\n\nSyria's state-run SANA news agency said Turkish troops and its allied fighters attacked Syrian army positions outside the town of Tal Tamr.\n\nThe Syrian troops fought back and suffered 'martyrs and wounded,' the agency reported without elaborating.\n\nUnder a deal struck between Erdogan and Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, the Kurds have 150 hours to withdraw from the zone.\n\nHowever, Turkey remains poised to attack and Erdogan yesterday voiced fears that the Kurdish fighters might stay in the zone by pretending to be Syrian government forces.\n\nToday he renewed his threat to resume Turkey's military offensive if his country continued to be 'harassed' by the Kurdish militia.\n\nHe also said Turkey would 'crush' any Syrian Kurdish fighter its military comes across while trying to secure areas under its control.\n\nTurkish and Russian troops will jointly patrol a buffer zone after the Kurdish fighters have withdrawn, while another area will be under sole Turkish control.\n\n'We would never shy away from moving ahead on our path. We would never calculate whether the price to pay on this path would be too high or too low,' Erdogan said.\n\nAnkara faced fresh condemnation today as U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Turkey was 'heading in the wrong direction'.\n\n'Turkey put us all in a very terrible situation and I think the incursion's unwarranted,' the Pentagon chief said.\n\nNew power brokers: Russian troops stand next to two of their vehicles in northern Syria today\n\nOn alert: A Russian military vehicle drives under an archway in the city of Kobane on Thursday\n\nEuropean Parliament condemns Turkey The European Parliament today condemned Turkey's invasion of northern Syria and demanded an urgent withdrawal. MEPs backed a resolution which branded the Turkish offensive a 'serious violation of international law' and 'comrpomises the stability and security of the region as a whole'. They also rejected the creation of a so-called 'security zone' and voiced their solidarity with the Turkish people. Members also called on EU nations to take a 'series of targeted sanctions and visa bans' against officials 'responsible for human rights violations'. They want member states to consider 'the suspension of trade preferences under the agreement on agricultural products and, as a last resort, the suspension of the customs union' between the EU and Turkey. While the European Parliament wields some influence it is not the key decision-maker in Brussels. Its resolution today earned an instant rebuke from Ankara. 'We reject in totality the approach adopted today by the European Parliament on Operation Source of Peace', the Turkish foreign ministry reacted in a statement. 'No force will be able to prevent Turkey from taking the necessary measures to ensure its security,' they said.\n\nIn Strasbourg, the European Parliament urged a Turkish withdrawal from Syria and accused Erdogan of a 'serious violation of international law'.\n\nRejecting the idea of a 'security zone', MEPs called on member states to take 'a series of targeted sanctions and visa bans' against any top Turkish officials 'responsible for human rights violations.\n\nHowever, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has refused to condemn Turkey, saying it has 'legitimate security concerns' along its border with Syria.\n\nDiscussions among NATO ministers 'are going to be forceful' but 'there's no question of arguing,' a high-ranking diplomat said.\n\nGermany has already floated the idea of an international security zone, possibly even involving German troops.\n\nBerlin's defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said she would raise the plan with her counterparts at the NATO meeting.\n\n'It is important that international action to resolve this crisis is not limited to Turkey and Russia,' Angela Merkel's spokesman told reporters yesterday.\n\n'Europe must deal with current events taking place at the border of our continent because these are issues that directly affect several EU member states.'\n\nStoltenberg said the German proposal would need UN approval to be implemented and therefore 'needs to be discussed more in detail before any decision can be made'.\n\nIn addition, any deployment of German troops remains highly controversial because of the legacy of World War II.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad has profited from the turmoil by dispatching troops to part of the country where they had not set foot in years.\n\nA map showing the area that will be patrolled by Russian and Turkish forces under the agreement struck between Putin and Erdogan this week\n\nDiscussion: A Russian officer rests his hand on the front of a military vehicle as he speeks to a colleague in the city of Kobane yesterday\n\nTurkish presence: Two of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's soldiers patrol the northern Syrian town of Tal Abyad on Wednesday as Turkey stamps its authority on the border zone\n\nHis forces will help the Russians carry out joint patrols in the 18-mile zone along the Turkish border.\n\nThe two countries are also said to be in talks about extra deliveries of Russian-made S-400 missile defence systems to Ankara.\n\nTurkey has previously backed rebels fighting against Assad, but Erdogan's deal with Putin has now given the Syrian leader 'de facto recognition', experts said.\n\nWith American troops gone, Russia is now the major power-broker in Syria - another boost to Assad who counts Putin as a close ally.\n\nYesterday Putin hosted dozens of African leaders at a summit in Sochi as Moscow seeks to spread its influence across Africa and the Middle East.\n\nRussian troops crossed the Euphrates River in Syria on Wednesday to start patrolling the area alongside Syrian forces.\n\nPatrols have already begun near the city of Manbij, where U.S. troops were manning a base until two weeks ago.\n\nThe Russians also entered the city of Kobani in a particularly symbolic blow to the Kurds, who fought ISIS for control of it in 2014-15.\n\nMoscow's deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin said he hoped the Kurds would go voluntarily, avoiding the dire fate predicted by the Kremlin which said they would be 'mauled' by Turkish forces if they remained in the zone.\n\nTurkey said there was 'no need' to resume its military onslaught when a five-day ceasefire ended on Tuesday night- but Syrians were injured by a blast in the border area\n\nProvocation: The Turkish flag (right) and the emblem of anti-Assad rebels in Syria (left) are unfurled on the roof of a former Kurdish headquarters in the town of Ras al-Ain yesterday\n\nHowever, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said Kurdish civilians would not have to leave their homes, amid fears of 'ethnic cleansing' in the region.\n\nTurkey halted its offensive last week under a US-brokered ceasefire and said there was 'no need' to resume military operations when the ceasefire expired on Tuesday.\n\nBut Ankara has also warned that it will take 'necessary measures' to 'neutralise' any Kurdish fighters who remain in the border area.\n\nErdogan wants a southern buffer zone against the Kurdish fighters, whom he considers terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, Bashar al-Assad's forces are returning to long-abandoned towns and villages without firing a shot after the Americans pulled out.\n\nAbandoned by U.S. forces, the Kurds had no choice but to turn to Russia and its ally Syria for help against Turkey.\n\nAnkara has previously backed anti-Assad rebels and an opposition flag was unveiled alongside a Turkish one at a former Kurdish headquarters in Syria yesterday.\n\nHowever, Turkey has decided it would rather have Assad's forces along the border than the Kurdish fighters it wants expelled.\n\nRussian presence: Putin's soldiers walk past a Russian military police vehicle at a position in the north-eastern Syrian city of Kobane\n\nU.S. troops leaving Syria and heading to Iraq earlier this week in a withdrawal which has opened the way for a Turkish invasion and thrust Syria back into the international spotlight\n\nAngry Kurds have blocked US troops in the streets as they cross from Syria into Iraq in a display of hostility after Washington pulled the plug on their support\n\nThe deal has given the Syrian leader 'de facto recognition,' said Lina Khatib of UK think-tank Chatham House.\n\n'Assad and Russia see this recognition as the beginning of international community normalization with the Assad regime, and as such an indication of their victory in the war,' she said.\n\nTrump has shown no interest in toppling Assad and pulled U.S. forces out of Syria to bring troops home from what he called 'endless wars' in the Middle East.\n\nThat opened the door to Turkey's invasion in what was widely condemned as a betrayal of the Kurdish fighters who had helped to defeat ISIS.\n\nWith American forces gone, the border zone is now a tinderbox of Turkish, Russian and Syrian forces as well as anti-Assad rebels - shattering Kurdish hopes of autonomy.\n\nDeclaring that the ceasefire would become 'permanent', Trump said he was lifting sanctions which were imposed on Turkey after the invasion began.\n\nHowever, a a top U.S. official warned that more than 100 ISIS prisoners had escaped since Turkey's invasion began.\n\nJames Jeffrey told Congress that the State Department 'does not know where they are', amid fears of a mass jailbreak amid the chaos in the region.\n\nDetention camps in Syria are believed to be holding more than 10,000 militants, including some 2,000 foreign fighters.", "description": "In a provocative speech in Ankara, Erdogan (pictured today) savaged Western powers for refusing to take in millions of refugees and threatened to send to Europe to 'see how they deal with it'.", "authors": ["Tim Stickings For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/16/20138412-0-image-a-20_1571929355944.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
