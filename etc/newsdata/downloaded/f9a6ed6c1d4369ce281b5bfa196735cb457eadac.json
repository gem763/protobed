The prime minister, who repeatedly promised to pull the country out by the previous deadline of October 31, now hopes to run on a platform that blames the U.K. parliament for blocking Brexit.\n\nJust 299 of 650 MPs voted for the motion. Johnson needed a two-thirds majority to trigger an election through the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act. His move was blocked by opposition parties including Labour, which has ruled out voting for an election unless a no-deal Brexit is completely ruled out.\n\n\"It is frankly time for the leader of the opposition to move his rusty Trabant from the yellow box junction where it is currently blocking progress.\u201d \u2014 Boris Johnson\n\n\u201cThis house cannot any longer keep this country hostage,\u201d the prime minister said after he lost the vote, and called on the public to \u201creplace this dysfunctional parliament.\u201d\n\nYet Johnson had Plan B ready in his back pocket.\n\nHe told MPs he will propose a short, one-off piece of legislation to trigger an election on December 12. The advantage of this route is that it requires just a simple majority of MPs to vote in favor of it, instead of two-thirds of the house.\n\nA No. 10 Downing Street official said: \u201cThis is the way to get Brexit done so the country can move on.\u201d\n\nTo pass the bill, Johnson will seek to work together with the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party, who have said they will back a December election now that Brexit has been delayed to January 31.\n\nStuck on the date\n\nBut there is still one major sticking point: the date.\n\nThe Lib Dems and SNP want the election to take place on December 9, while the prime minister has insisted on December 12. The pro-EU parties favor the earlier date because it leaves less time for the prime minister to push the deal he struck with EU leaders through parliament, thus pulling the U.K. out of the European Union.\n\nIt\u2019s a difference of just three days \u2014 but it could sink Johnson\u2019s fresh attempt to force an election.\n\nAccording to a No 10 official, the thinking in Downing Street is that for an election to happen on December 9, parliament would have to be dissolved on November 1 \u2014 at the end of this week. The official said this was too short a time period in which to get the election bill through parliament, especially as the government also plans to pass a budget bill for Northern Ireland this week.\n\nBut Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said her party had \u201calready rejected\u201d the December 12 proposal. \u201cBoris Johnson claims he wants a general election, but he also claimed he wouldn\u2019t prorogue parliament or put a border down the Irish Sea,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could have supported our bill for a general election on December 9.\u201d\n\nIf the Liberal Democrats refuse to back Johnson's election bill on Tuesday, that reduces the chances that it will succeed. But it doesn\u2019t eliminate them completely.\n\nThe government needs 326 votes, and if it gets the entire Conservative Party and SNP\u2019s backing, it will have 323 \u2014 meaning that just three Labour rebels or ex-Tory independents could see the bill pass.\n\nOne Labour MP, Kate Hoey, voted in favor of a snap election on Monday, alongside 18 independent MPs including ex-Tories Alistair Burt, David Gauke, Amber Rudd and Rory Stewart.\n\nThe SNP has refused to reveal its hand. Following Monday's vote, its Westminster leader Ian Blackford said his party required \u201can absolute cast-iron assurance\u201d that Johnson would not bring back his Brexit deal before an election.\n\n\u201cWe have a prime minister who will say anything, do anything to get his way.\u201d \u2014 Jeremy Corbyn\n\nBoth the SNP and Liberal Democrats fear the deal being ratified before an election is held. They now publicly admit that there is no majority for a second Brexit referendum in this current parliament, and they fear that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which ratifies Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal into U.K. law, could go through with the support of maverick Labour MPs. In a vote last week, the bill was approved with a majority of 30.\n\nA No. 10 official said the government will not bring back the Withdrawal Agreement Bill while the election bill is going through parliament \u2014 which could give the SNP the assurance it needs to throw its weight behind a snap poll.\n\nBut if both the SNP and Liberal Democrats decide that Johnson can't be trusted to keep his promise, his election bid could once again fail.\n\nA key risk for Johnson during the passage of the bill is that opposition MPs could attempt to extend voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds or to EU citizens by amending the bill. It is not clear, however, whether those voters would make it onto the electoral register in time.\n\nAn election no one wants\n\n\u201cNobody in this house relishes the idea of a general election,\u201d the prime minister told the Commons ahead of the vote on Monday, insisting that he would rather deliver Brexit with a \u201cblazing urgency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI simply do not believe that this house is capable of delivering on the priorities of the people, whether that means Brexit or anything else,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is frankly time for the leader of the opposition to move his rusty Trabant from the yellow box junction where it is currently blocking progress.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nJeremy Corbyn replied that he didn\u2019t trust the prime minister \u2014 and neither did voters. \u201cWe have a prime minister who will say anything, do anything to get his way,\u201d he said. \u201cHe will avoid his responsibilities, break his promises to dodge scrutiny.\u201d\n\nCorbyn accused Johnson of trying to suppress voter turnout by forcing a poll in the depths of winter. \u201cIn parts of this country it will be dark before 4 p.m.,\u201d he said, adding that students will have gone home for their Christmas holidays. \u201cNo general election has been held in December since 1923.\u201d\n\nAfter Johnson announced that he would put a general election bill to a vote on Tuesday, Corbyn said that Labour would \u201cobviously look and scrutinize that bill.\u201d\n\nBut it may turn out to be a decision that is out of his party's hands.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
