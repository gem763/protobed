An investigation revealed that Helus and his fellow officers essentially \u201cwalked into an ambush.\u201d This Sunday, a charity event featuring a flag football game, dubbed \u201cthe Blue Bowl\u201d was scheduled to raise money to help Helus\u2019 widow and child, along with the families of other LEOs who fell in the line of duty. That\u2019s a nice gesture for those who gave all to serve their fellow citizens, isn\u2019t it?\n\nExcept now it\u2019s apparently not going to happen. The event has been \u201cindefinitely postponed\u201d after Thousand Oaks Police Chief Tim Hagel withdrew his department from participation. The thousands of dollars already raised are being returned. Why? The Chief was no longer \u201ccomfortable\u201d with the event because Trump supporters had been invited to speak there. (Fox News)\n\nA charity event planned in honor of an officer killed in a 2018 mass shooting at a country music bar in in Southern California has been postponed indefinitely \u2014 reportedly because a police chief didn\u2019t want Republicans invited. The Blue Bowl, a charity flag football game, was intended to raise money for the family of fallen Ventura County Sgt. Ron Helus as well as other officers killed in the line of duty, FOX 11 of Los Angeles reported\u2026 \u201cHe basically said over and over in the conversation, \u2018This is not Trump country, that slogan \u2018Make America Great\u2019 is not favorable, popular, within 1,200 square miles,\u2019 that we don\u2019t want Republicans here. I could not believe it,\u201d Mike Randall, vice president of the Fallen Officers Foundation, said, according to FOX 11.\n\nPolice Chief Tim Hagel went on from there to tell the organizers that the only thing they could have done to make it worse would be to \u201cinvite Dick Cheney and Sarah Huckabee Sanders.\u2019\n\nI realize we\u2019re talking about California here, so you should always expect the worst, but is this really how far we have fallen at this point? This wasn\u2019t a political rally or a fundraiser for candidates from one party or the other. This is a senior cop boycotting a fundraiser for fallen officers. Chief Hagel reportedly told the organizers that the Honor Guard would not be attending and that none of his officers would be allowed to show up.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but notice one comment left at the original article from someone claiming to be a conservative and a Trump supporter who knows Chief Hagel personally. He describes the Chief as being a generally decent man and \u201can excellent officer.\u201d The commenter goes on to state that he was at the Helus funeral and he saw the Chief looking \u201cgenuinely torn up\u201d over the officer\u2019s death. Maybe there\u2019s more than meets the eye here, though I have a hard time coming up with an alternate explanation.\n\nPerhaps if Hagel gets blistered enough in the public square over this there will still be time for the event to go off as scheduled this Sunday. That is, of course, assuming that he has the capacity to feel enough shame to issue an apology and schedule the Honor Guard to attend. But as of this writing, there are no signs that he\u2019s going to try to walk this PR disaster back yet.\n\nAssuming the Chief sticks to his guns, what are the other options for the organizers? Perhaps they could just rely on other, more sane departments to pitch in the manpower and ask the Trump supporters to drum up additional participants. In the meantime, I suppose the widows and children of the fallen officers will just have to wait.", "description": "It's come to this", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/police-memorial.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
