Lose and have their fate tested \u2014 at least a bit. The Nationals still could have beaten the Cleveland Indians in their regular season finale Sunday to secure home field, or the Milwaukee Brewers could have fallen Saturday night (or Sunday) to the Colorado Rockies in Denver. Yet there was no reason to bring other teams into the equation.\n\nThe Nationals chose the path of least resistance. They beat the visiting Indians, 10-7, on Saturday to ensure they\u2019ll host the Brewers or the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday at Nationals Park. The only questions after their seventh straight win were which team they\u2019ll face and which 25 players they\u2019ll carry on their roster.\n\nWashington racked up nine runs in the second inning, a rally capped by a Gerardo Parra grand slam, to create a yawning deficit and make it so a rough start by Patrick Corbin didn\u2019t sting. That let the Nationals shift their focus to the game that could be the beginning or sudden end of their October baseball. It also made sure that game will be in their park.\n\n[Svrluga: Ryan Zimmerman is at the end of his deal, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the Nats without him]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome. I don\u2019t have to go home and pack,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez. \u201cNice to stay at home. The boys wanted to stay at home, so they came out and swung the bats. And here we go on Tuesday.\u201d\n\nBut while home field was a goal and preferred by most players in the clubhouse, it was never painted as a necessity. Trea Turner noted that the Nationals have lost Game 5 of an NL Division Series in Washington three times. Brian Dozier, on the other hand, described the Brewers\u2019 playoff atmosphere at Miller Park as the best he has seen. Bench coach Chip Hale said the Nationals would play on the moon if they had to.\n\nAnd it\u2019s likely that everyone would get in the shuttle with him.\n\n\u201cWould it be nice? Yes. But is it imperative? No,\u201d said Max Scherzer, who\u2019s slated to start the wild-card game, a few hours before its location was sealed. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to play anybody anywhere.\u201d\n\nMartinez didn\u2019t stress how important home-field advantage was to him, but he didn\u2019t have to. He showed it with the lineup he rolled out Saturday, including every regular starter except Victor Robles. Robles is sick \u2014 the team has spent the past week passing around a nasty cough \u2014 and that led Parra into center field and the seventh spot in the order. The 32-year-old shook off a slump with three hits and four RBI on Friday. Then he contributed to the Nationals\u2019 latest depth display.\n\nThe second-inning eruption began with Corbin. The pitcher, who entered with a .079 batting average, lifted a single to left center to score Ryan Zimmerman with the game\u2019s first run. That left the bases loaded with no outs. Turner struck out swinging, but after that Washington clicked. Adam Eaton blooped an RBI single behind third base. Anthony Rendon roped a two-run double. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera added an RBI knock after Cleveland intentionally walked Juan Soto, and Zimmerman popped out before Parra walked to the plate.\n\n[Baseball according to Gerardo Parra]\n\nIndians starter Adam Plutko had already been chased from the game, so reliever Hunter Wood stared Parra down. Parra\u2019s first grand slam for the Nationals, way back on May 11 in Los Angeles against the Dodgers, was a lift for a club still trying to find itself. His second, off Wood\u2019s high fastball, all but put the Indians away. It sent the home crowd into a shark-clapping frenzy. It triggered a dugout dance party \u2014 a tradition Parra helped start \u2014 and ended with him embracing teammate and close friend An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable, unbelievable,\u201d Parra said of his hot streak. \u201c[Friday] was a big day, but I think today is another big day because it\u2019s a big win and we\u2019re starting here in the wild-card game.\u201d\n\nCorbin was soon roughed up for six runs on three homers. It was only the fourth time this season that he allowed six or more runs. Two of Cleveland\u2019s home runs against Corbin came in a four-run fourth. The last came in the fifth, a two-run rocket by Franmil Reyes, and that led Martinez out to hook Corbin. He lasted 4\u2153 innings and got up to 94 pitches just three days before Martinez wants him available in the bullpen during the wild-card game.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 bullpen has just one healthy left-hander: closer Sean Doolittle. Martinez has stated, repeatedly, that Corbin and fellow starter Stephen Strasburg would pitch behind Scherzer if necessary. Corbin\u2019s final start wasn\u2019t an encouraging audition for such a high-leverage role in such a high-pressure game. But his overall body of work \u2014 a 3.25 ERA in 33 starts, more than 10 strikeouts per nine innings \u2014 is substantial enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be ready to go if my name is called,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a do-or-die game Tuesday, so it will be exciting.\u201d\n\nThe bullpen held the Indians down beyond Sean Doolittle allowing a solo homer in the ninth. The Nationals have spent this week working through an unwritten checklist. They clinched their spot in the postseason. They gained traction with a five-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThen they locked up home field, whether they needed to or not, and now only the biggest objective looms.", "description": "Gerardo Parra\u2019s second-inning grand slam gave Washington a nine-run lead, and the Nationals held on for a 10-7 victory over Cleveland.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/r2UIVyIqFUOuX9FV98I_YGwIs4c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KBFZKLXCIYI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
