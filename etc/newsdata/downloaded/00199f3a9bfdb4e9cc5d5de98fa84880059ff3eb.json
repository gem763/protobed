Buzz60\n\nPHOENIX, Ariz. \u2014 For nearly 20 minutes Sunday, Carl and Marsha Mueller spoke by phone with President Donald Trump about the military operation that ended with the death of the terrorist leader believed to be the captor and rapist of the Mueller's daughter, Kayla.\n\nTrump had answered many of the questions the Muellers asked, and they were grateful for his kindness.\n\nThey were not expecting the next phone call.\n\nIt was Robert O\u2019Brien, the White House national security adviser, who delivered a new bit of news: The military operation, the one that resulted in the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, had been named after their daughter, Kayla.\n\n\u201cIt was so touching for us to know that,\u201d Carl said.\n\nAl-Baghdadi reportedly had been the captor and rapist of Kayla, a 26-year-old aid worker who was taken hostage in 2013 as she left a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria. She was held hostage for 18 months before militants announced her death in 2015.\n\nThe events of the weekend brought some comfort for two people who had found little of that in the six years since their daughter disappeared.\n\n'She wants us to get them'\n\nFrom their Prescott, Arizona, ranch house along a curvy mountain road, Carl and Marsha had watched Trump\u2019s press conference Sunday morning, when he announced al-Baghdadi's death.\n\nAnd then they had waited for the president's call.\n\nCarl fielded phone calls from media, calling for Marsha to come from the kitchen, where she was cleaning.\n\nIt\u2019s what she does when she\u2019s anxious. As she wiped counters and swept, she talked to Kayla, and to God.\n\nThrough the sliding glass door in the house where Kayla grew up, Marsha can keep an eye out for the great horned owls that sometimes appear on top of a wooden power pole out back. They were Kayla\u2019s favorite.\n\nWhen she was still in high school, Kayla had claimed the owl as her \u201cspirit animal.\u201d Just before she graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, she had an owl feather tattooed on her right side.\n\nMarsha was sure her daughter would be pleased that al-Baghdadi was dead.\n\n\u201cShe wants us to get them,\u201d Marsha said. \u201cI\u2019ve felt that with all my heart.\u201d\n\nAt the dining table, Carl made a list of questions for the president. \u201cIf you don\u2019t write it down, you forget in the moment,\u201d Carl said. \u201cIt\u2019s very intimidating.\u201d\n\nStill searching for answers\n\nA candlelight memorial in honor of Kayla Mueller was held on Feb. 18, 2015, in Prescott.

She hoped the ISIS leader\u2019s death would bring them answers.\n\nThe president called in the late afternoon Sunday.\n\nIt started as a typical condolence call, Carl said on Monday. He and Marsha are used to that.\n\nBut it became clear as Trump spoke that he knew Kayla\u2019s story, what she had endured, and what her parents had endured. Carl and Marsha found that comforting.\n\n\u201cHe was very cordial, and it was almost like talking to a friend,\u201d Carl said.\n\nHe told Trump that he and Marsha had a lot of questions, which he answered. When Carl paused, Trump asked, \u201cDo you have any more?\u201d\n\nThey spoke for 18 minutes and worked through 90 percent of the questions on the list Carl had made.\n\nThere was one question Trump couldn't answer. He promised Carl he would bring it up in a meeting he had scheduled Monday.\n\n'We have the ear of the White House'\n\nWhen O'Brien called, Carl and Marsha asked that he convey their gratitude to the force that conducted the mission that resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cWe know those men don\u2019t do it for the thanks or the gratitude,\u201d Carl said. \u201cThey do it for God and country. That\u2019s what those men are all about. They know how we feel, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nCarl said he suspects the mission involved some of the same soldiers who were part of a an unsuccessful 2015 rescue mission that targeted four prisoners held at a makeshift ISIS prison.\n\nBy the time U.S. commandos stormed the compound in that mission, the hostages were already gone. Some relatives and people who worked on the raid blamed the Obama White House for not acting swiftly enough on giving the mission a green light.\n\n\u201cNow they get a victory,\u201d Carl said Monday. \u201cNaming it after Kayla would make that victory even sweeter.\u201d\n\nAfter the two phone conversations, the Muellers felt buoyed.\n\n\"I still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\" Marsha said.\n\nOn Monday morning, just before 9 a.m., the Muellers' phone rang once more. Vice President Mike Pence was calling to express his support for the family.\n\n\u201cThis administration is being proactive, and we are very confident we are going to be be able to get the answers we\u2019ve been wanting for six years,\u201d Carl said.\n\nMost of the information the Muellers have gathered about Kayla have come from non-governmental sources and people working in the area still, all unofficial channels. Now, they feel like they are getting the help they wanted.\n\n\u201cWe have the ear of the White House now,\" he said. \"It\u2019s what we needed.\"\n\nFollow Katrina Bland on Facebook and Twitter @KarinaBland.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/29/trump-operation-killing-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-named-kayla-mueller/2494275001/", "description": "Carl and Marsha Mueller expected a call from President Donald Trump.
