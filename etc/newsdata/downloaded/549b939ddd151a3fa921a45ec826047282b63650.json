There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2019\n\n2) Pelosi\n\nPelosi told reporters after the meeting that Trump called her a \u201cthird-grade politician\u201d before adding, \u201cI think now we have to pray for his health.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n3) Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper\n\nEsper has not commented publicly on the meeting. After the meeting, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Esper undercut Trump\u2019s plan for containing the Islamic State by saying there was no intelligence to back up Trump\u2019s claim that Turkey and Syria would have the same interest in guarding Islamic State prisoners as the Kurds.\n\n4) Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs\n\nMilley\u2019s facial expression was the focus of much speculation following the meeting. An aide told The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey that Milley also undercut Trump\u2019s assertions on the Islamic State.\n\nAD\n\nTrump told legislative leaders today that he was tougher than Mattis, who was \"world's most overrated general,\" per Dem familiar with meeting. \"He wasn't tough enough. I captured ISIS.\" But Mark Milley, chairman of joint chiefs, said ISIS could \"reconstitute,\" per aide familiar. \u2014 Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) October 16, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s also the subject of a lot of Twitter jokes.\n\n5) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell did not speak at the meeting and declined to discuss it afterward. Sullivan and Scalise appeared to be in the same mind-set as Milley at the moment this photo was taken.\n\nMcConnell tells reporters, \u201cI didn't make any observations in the meeting. I don't have any to make now.\u201d \u2014 Emily Cochrane (@ESCochrane) October 16, 2019\n\n6) White House counsel Pat Cipollone\n\nMuch of Cipollone\u2019s face is hidden behind Scalise. Cipollone recently wrote to House Democrats that the White House would not participate in what he called an illegitimate impeachment inquiry. Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said impeachment did not come up at the meeting.\n\nAD\n\n7) White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland\n\nUeland\u2019s facial expression at the end of the table seems to mimic that of Scalise, Sullivan and Milley.\n\n8) Reps. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) and Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.)\n\nAfter Trump played down the threat posed by the Islamic State, saying the United States doesn\u2019t need to worry about \u201cterrorists 7,000 miles away,\u201d Cheney said the 9/11 terrorists also came from thousands of miles away. Engel is one of three House Democratic chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry.\n\nAD\n\nMenendez told CNN after the meeting that Trump was \u201cbelligerent\u201d from the start of the meeting.\n\n\u201cHe smacked down a whole bunch of papers on the table and said: \u2018You all asked for this meeting. I reluctantly agreed to it,\u2019\u201d Menendez said, referring to Trump. \u201cNo one had asked for the meeting.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n9) House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.)\n\nAfter the meeting, Hoyer said, \u201cNever have I seen a president treat so disrespectfully a co-equal branch of the government of the United States.\u201d\n\n10) Sens. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.)\n\nSchumer told reporters after the meeting that Trump engaged in a \u201cnasty diatribe not focused on the facts.\u201d\n\n11) Reps. Mac Thornberry (R-Tex.) and Michael McCaul (R-Tex.)\n\nBoth voted to broadly condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria before meeting with Trump. Pelosi raised the 354-60 vote with Trump at the meeting.\n\nAD\n\n12) White House and congressional aides, including Schumer\u2019s chief of staff, Mike Lynch, and Pelosi\u2019s chief of staff, Terri McCullough\n\nAD\n\nTop aides for Pelosi, Schumer, McConnell and McCarthy attended the meeting.\n\n13) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and McCarthy\n\nAfter the meeting, McCarthy slammed Pelosi for \u201cstorming out\u201d of the meeting and said it was \u201cproductive\u201d after she left.\n\n14) Other reported attendees\n\nTrump tweeted out two additional angles of the meeting.\n\nDo you think they like me? pic.twitter.com/TDmUnJ8HtF \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2019\n\nAdam Smith (D-Wash.), the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was seated next to three empty chairs after Pelosi left. After the meeting, Smith said Trump insulted former defense secretary Jim Mattis \u201cat great length.\u201d\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith on Trump\u2019s comments about Mattis at White House meeting:\n\n\n\n\"He insulted the former defense secretary at great length. \u2026 He basically said, \u2018Consider the source, he doesn't know what he's talking about, he's a terrible general.\u2019\" pic.twitter.com/pUeeV1dzKn \u2014 JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) October 16, 2019\n\nMcConnell\u2019s chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, and McCarthy\u2019s chief of staff, Dan Meyer, are among those seated against the back wall.\n\nDid we miss anyone or anything?
