It has pledged to plant an additional 1 million trees in the next six months in response to Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s anti-environment policies.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

For many it might seem \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d \u2013 but is it?\n\nEach month the company releases financial reports which show how it is spending money.\n\nIts July 2019 report shows that 52 per cent of its total income was spent on tree-planting (which is 80 per cent of surplus revenue). This amounted to more than \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3725,000). It spent 5 per cent on advertising, 30 per cent on operational costs and 12 per cent was saved to fund future investments.\n\nOrganisations that work with Ecosia confirmed to online fact-checking website Snopes that they received the money as outlined in the financial report.\n\nExperts agree that the company is a progressive and environmentally conscious organisation. However, funding tree-planting schemes must not distract people from stopping deforestation \u2013 much of which is driven by unregulated trade agreements with the EU and US.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

is too little to initiate the urgent large-scale action required,\u201d said Andre Laperri\u00e8re, executive director of UK-based NGO Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (Godan).\n\n\u201cWhat the Amazon needs at this stage is not more trees, it needs a policy level change at the government level, to truly make a difference. Temporary planting of trees only to be cut down by the industries and farming communities would be unhelpful.\u201d\n\nBrazil is home to 200 million cows and is the largest beef exporter in the world. The proposed EU-Mercosur free trade agreement could mean South American countries can increase their beef quota to 99,000 tonnes on a new low 7.5 per cent tariff.\n\nInvestigations have found meat farmed on illegal pasture in the Amazon can already be bought on the shelves of five major British supermarkets.\n\nMr Laperri\u00e8re said global governments \u2013 particularly those that import Brazilian beef and agricultural produce \u2013 need to put pressure on the country to create better environmental certification standards. The EU and US are some of Brazil\u2019s largest traders and hold considerable influence over how produce is grown.\n\nReducing beef consumption, avoiding food waste and shopping more ethically can also avoid environmental destruction. \u201cThe individual carbon footprints have the biggest impact, often in places hundreds of miles from your home,\u201d said Mr Laperri\u00e8re.\n\nIn an open letter published in April this year, more than 600 scientists and 300 Brazilian indigenous groups asked the EU to ensure that trade deals with Brazil respect the environment.\n\nRichard George, head of forests at Greenpeace UK, agreed that reforestation is essential but means nothing if the Amazon is still going up in smoke. He said people can make a difference by eating less meat and dairy and eating more plant-based foods.\n\n\u201cAlongside this, governments must suspend trade deals and companies suspend purchasing until the Amazon and its people are protected \u2013 we can all put pressure on them to do this ... We can\u2019t just plant our way out of the climate emergency by using a different search engine \u2013 if only it were that simple,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Anna Kitulagoda from WWF-UK, it is important that tree-planting projects \u2013 although important \u2013 don\u2019t make people lose focus from tackling deforestation.\n\n\u201cWell-designed projects to plant trees \u2013 ensuring the right trees in the right places \u2013 are urgently needed. But it\u2019s critical that projects like these continue to complement and don\u2019t replace a focus on tackling deforestation, and the loss of the most carbon and biodiversity-rich forests on our planet: our tropical rainforests,\u201d she said.", "description": "Images of the Amazon being ravaged by wildfires has unified the public in shock and sadness.\u00a0 Scientists warn that these fires are destroying \u201cthe lungs of the Earth\u201d which will seriously jeopardise our ability to avoid catastrophic levels of global warming.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/19/ecosia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
