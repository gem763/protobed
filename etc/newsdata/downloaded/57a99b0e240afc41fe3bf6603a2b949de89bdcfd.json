Because I believe that hurt people, hurt people. And you\u2019ve got to be in a really bad headspace to want to make someone feel bad.\n\nTruth: The former Gogglebox star 28, also stated that \u2018the world would be a boring place if we all looked the same\u2019 as she launches her new, inclusive Scarlett Loves Peacock edit\n\n\u2018So, a couple of times I have actually messaged people and said, \u201care you okay?\u201d and every time I\u2019ve done that, they\u2019ve always messaged back and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d So hopefully they learn from it.\u2019\n\nPointing out the downside to her bold actions, she added: \u2018Unfortunately, you can\u2019t spend all your time messaging people asking if they\u2019re alright!\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not just Scarlett who has her own way of coping with the criticism, her mother Betty also has a tried and tested method of releasing her anger when her daughter is trolled.\n\n\u2018My mum will write out her response to the trolls but will never actually post it, she just deletes it!\u2019 she explained. \u2018She\u2019s always like \u201cI just want to press send!\u201d and I\u2019m like \u201cyou can\u2019t! It would be everywhere; you can\u2019t press send!\u201d\n\nBold move: \u2018A couple of times I have inboxed people who have said horrific things and I\u2019ve asked if they\u2019re okay. Because I believe that hurt people, hurt people\n\nOn a more serious note, Scarlett stresses that trolls should be called out for what they really are; \u2018bullies\u2019, adding that the word \u2018troll\u2019 in a way \u2018de-humanises\u2019 the person making them seem less real.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I know that that is sounds really mean but I feel like we\u2019ve got to a stage where the word \u2018troll\u2019\u2026 when you think of trolls you think of a fantasy character, whereas I think they should just be called bullies because that is what they are essentially.\n\n\u2018I feel like by calling them trolls, we\u2019re sort of de-humanising them and at the end of the day, they are just people being mean!\u2019\n\nOpening up on how the negative feedback impacts on her, she shared: \u2018Obviously, it gets to me, I\u2019d be lying if I sat here and said, \u201cyeah everything\u2019s fine\u201d. But there are some days where it\u2019s just relentless and I think I just want a bit of a break from it. But I just try and now focus on the positives,\n\nApology: \u2018So, a couple of times I have actually messaged people and said, \u201care you okay?\u201d and every time I\u2019ve done that, they\u2019ve always messaged back and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\n\nSpeaking out: On a more serious note, Scarlett stresses that trolls should be called out for what they really are; \u2018bullies\u2019, adding that the word \u2018troll\u2019 in a way \u2018de-humanises\u2019 the person\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just in a good headspace where I think I can\u2019t let them win. For every hundred comments, there might be five to ten bad ones. Rather than focusing on those ones, I\u2019ll re-read the positive ones and try and focus on the positivity.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s this positivity that the presenter has held on to as she embraces her curves and conveys the message that it\u2019s okay to just be yourself and not have to compare yourself with anyone else.\n\nIn a message of body positivity for her fans, she said: \u2018Without sounding clich\u00e9, you just have to try and focus on the things you do like about yourself.\n\n\u2018I think even some people even struggle to find one thing they like about themselves, but I say listen to your friends and family around you. Listen to positive things that they say, and then focus on those because sometimes we just get caught up in looking at people who are conventionally beautiful and think \u201cwhy can\u2019t I look like that?\u201d The world would be so boring if we all looked the same!\u2019\n\nHaving her say: 'When you think of trolls you think of a fantasy character, whereas I think they should just be called bullies because that is what they are essentially'\n\nAmazing:' For every hundred comments, there might be five to ten bad ones. Rather than focusing on those ones, I\u2019ll re-read the positive ones and try and focus on the positivity'\n\nShe continued: \u2018There are so many people on TV that are all different shapes and sizes, it\u2019s wonderful that some people are really fit. I\u2019m not body shaming for those who are slim but there seems to be like a huge amount of people who are fit on the TV but not a lot of curvy girls. So, I feel like I\u2019ve got to rep it a little bit for the curvy girls!\u2019\n\nAnd with that said, the I\u2019m A Celebrity winner has teamed-up with Highstreet chain Peacocks to launch her new Scarlett Loves edit, which caters for women from size 8 to size 22.\n\nSpeaking of her new range, she enthused: \u2018This has given me such a massive confidence boost!\n\nConfident: Sometimes we just get caught up in looking at people who are conventionally beautiful and think \u201cwhy can\u2019t I look like that?\u201d The world would be so boring if we all looked the same!\u2019\n\n\u2018It goes from size 8-22 and I\u2019ve really focused on having things that nip you in the waist and cover the tops of your arms, things that I feel slightly self-conscious about. I\u2019ve taken all those aspects away so that when you look in the mirror, you think \u201cyeah, I look good!\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u2018The big thing that I think a lot of women struggle with, me included, is what to put with stuff. So, I tried to pick items that literally goes with jeans, with jeggings, or you can wear a dress with ankle boots and put a pair of tights on with it. I tried to choose very classic pieces. I\u2019m really proud of it and excited for everyone to see it!\u2019\n\nWith the recent influx of celebrity edits and endorsed clothing ranges on the market, the star revealed what makes hers stand out from the rest of the pack.\n\nRepresent: 'There seems to be like a huge amount of people who are fit on the TV but not a lot of curvy girls. So, I feel like I\u2019ve got to rep it a little bit for the curvy girls!\u2019\n\nShe explained: \u2018Obviously aside from being affordable, I think that there isn\u2019t a specific age. The thing is, a lot of the others are directed at young people. And with mine, yes, they can be worn by the young but because they are classic pieces, I can wear it, or my mum can wear it. I tried to not specifically go for just young people, which was hard to do, but I think we\u2019ve really managed it!\u2019\n\nFurther discussing the affordability of her collection, which includes a camel coat, floral print dress and chunky knits, Scarlett said: \u2018Whenever I watch telly and have seen an outfit that looks amazing, I\u2019d Google it or go on someone\u2019s Instagram and then it turns out to be like a \u00a3400 dress!\n\n\u2018Whereas a big thing for me is I wanted women and girls to be able to go \u201coh, where is this from?\u201d and it will be actually affordable, and they won\u2019t actually have to save up for a year to get it!\u2019\n\nScarlett Loves Peacocks edit is out now in-store and online at www.peacocks.co.uk ranging in sizes 8-22 with prices starting from \u00a36.00.", "description": "Scarlett Moffatt, 28, revealed that she privately messages body shamers on social media to ask if they're okay as she discusses how she tackles negative criticism.", "authors": ["Niomi Harris For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/20/19268196-0-image-a-28_1570130323732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
