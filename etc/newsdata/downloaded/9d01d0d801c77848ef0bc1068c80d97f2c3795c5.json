He was also there for the first Battle of Ypres.\n\nHe was awarded both the Iron and Military Merit Cross and discharged in 1918.\n\nRudolf Hess is pictured with Adolf Hitler at Party Day in Nuremberg, Germany\n\nAfter hearing Adolf Hitler speak for the first time at a rally in Munich in 1920, Hess became completely devoted to him.\n\nHe shared Hitler's 'stab in the back' theory, that Germany lost the Great War because the Jews and Bolsheviks conspired.\n\nHess joined the NSDAP in 1920 and worked closer and closer with the leader as time went on.\n\nIn November 1923 Hitler decided to try to overthrow the Bavarian leader Gustav Von Kahr with the SA.\n\nA gun-wielding Hitler interrupted Kahr's speech and called for a national revolution. The following day Hitler and thousands of his supporters marched to the Ministry of War, where shots were fired and 14 marchers and four police officers were killed.\n\nBoth Hess and Hitler were sent to Landsberg Prison, where the latter wrote his autobiography Mein Kamph.\n\nHe dictated it to Hess and rewarded him by giving him the job of deputy Fuhrer on the pair's release.\n\nRudolf Hess was Hitler's right-hand man in the Third Reich throughout the 1930s and assumed his position as his deputy in April 1933.\n\nHe became increasingly marginalised after the Second World War broke out as Hitler became more and more concerned by foreign policy and not internal affairs.\n\nHess was very concerned about Hitler's plans to invade Russia, fearing Germany would face war on two fronts.\n\nA young Hess gives the Nazi salute at the opening of the Adolf Hitler Canal in 1939\n\nHe was so concerned he taught himself to fly so he could go to Britain and seek a peace deal from the British Government.\n\nIt is thought he flew the Messerschmitt Bf 110 to Scotland in May 1941 in a bid to bring Britain to the negotiating table and put an end to the war.\n\nHe ended up running out of fuel and landed in Eaglesham, 10 miles south of Glasgow.\n\nHe was captured by a local policeman and held in custody. Meanwhile Hitler was furious at the betrayal.\n\nThe British spent a whole year debriefing him before he was sent to a medical institution in Monmouthshire, Wales for three years.\n\nAfter peace returned in 1945 he was tried for war crimes at Nuremburg and sentenced to life behind bars.\n\nHess is pictured in the height of his power when he was Adolf Hitler's deputy Fuhrer\n\nHe was found guilty of crimes against peace and conspiring with other German leaders to commit those crimes. He was not convicted of crimes against humanity.\n\nDuring the trial he developed 'amnesia', unable to recall details of what happened during the war.\n\nHe was eventually declared sane and fit to stand trial and was forced to admit he had faked the amnesia as a defence tactic.\n\nIt took the court two months to decide on sentencing. Most of the Nazis tried at Nuremburg were given the death penalty.\n\nInstead Hess was sentenced to life in prison at Spandau, west Berlin.\n\nHe spent 41 years there, where he disconnected himself with his family, and often complained about the food and the state of his heath.\n\nThe six other Nazis housed there were eventually released, leaving him the sole prisoner.\n\nHe hanged himself in a summer house that had been built for him in the grounds on August 17 1987.\n\nAfter his death Spandau was demolished to prevent it become a shrine for neo-Nazis.", "description": "Hess was captured by\u00a01941 in Scotland after parachuting into the UK and tried at Nuremberg and later imprisoned at Berlin's Spandau prison.", "authors": ["Joe Pinkstone For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/22/17/8848262-0-image-a-31_1548179625201.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-22"}
