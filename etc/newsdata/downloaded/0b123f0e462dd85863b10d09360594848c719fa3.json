They were calling for a new war in Colombia.\n\nIn 2016, the pair made regular appearances on television screens across the country \u2013 and the world \u2013 dressed in white shirts, symbolic of the historic peace accord they had finally reached with the government after four years of internationally mediated negotiations in Havana. Mr Marquez had led Farc\u2019s negotiating team with Mr Santrich also at the table.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

He wants to create a new unit dedicated to pursuing them, and offered a reward of \u00a3725,000 for the head of each commander who appeared in the video.\n\nBut although Duque reiterated support for the peace process, the majority of his party would like to see it torn up.\n\nThis gifts them an opportune moment to return the country to war, said Sandra Borda, political analyst and associate professor at Los Andes University in Bogot\u00e1.\n\n\u201cThis could be a strong wake-up call to the government\u2026 does it want its main achievement to be having ended the prospect of peace?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t commit to it, if they don\u2019t realise the best response is committing to peace process, the potential that this becomes the beginning another conflict is very high.\u2019\u2019\n\nShe added: \u201cI am not optimistic at all.\u201d", "description": "Colombians awoke to two familiar faces on their TV screens on Thursday morning \u2013 those of\u00a0Ivan Marquez and Jesus Santrich,\u00a0former\u00a0leaders of the now-demobilised guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc).
