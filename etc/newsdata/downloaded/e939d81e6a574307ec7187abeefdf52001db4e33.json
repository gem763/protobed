As such, U.S. viewers may think that they\u2019ll be able to just tune into RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race U.K. and totally understand what\u2019s going on \u2014 and they would be as wrong as if they dared to show their index and middle fingers to say \u201ctwo, please.\u201d (Oh, you silly American, that is the British equivalent of flipping the bird.)\n\nSo in order to help Stateside viewers navigate Drag Race\u2019s trip across the Atlantic, here\u2019s what you need to know about the U.K. and its drag scene, so that you\u2019ll know what the bloody hell you\u2019re talking about when the show premieres on Logo tonight.\n\nDrag in the U.K.\n\nAs you might glean from the contestant with the chest hair or another who confesses to never having used fake boobs before, drag is a little bit different for the queen\u2019s subjects. England has a much longer history of men dressing as women, going back to Shakespeare\u2019s day, and is generally more accepting of drag in general. Just think about how many times the Monty Python guys dressed up as women to get a laugh.\n\nDrag is a popular form of pub entertainment not just in drag bars, but for the whole family. In the U.K. they would call it \u201cend of the pier\u201d entertainment, sort of working-class diversions that aren\u2019t meant to be art or to be taken too seriously. The quintessential English drag act is Lily Savage, a comedian and entertainer who was wildly popular way back in the \u201990s. (Good luck trying to understand a word she says.)\n\nU.K. queens tend to be much more used to doing jokes and singing their own songs, and less reliant on lip-syncing than queens in the U.S. Without the \u201cpageant system\u201d that is popular in parts of the States, English drag often eschews the sort of female impersonation and big-haired, rhinestone-dripping glamour you see from people like Kennedy Davenport. That\u2019s why no one really seems to care if a queen has chest hair, a flat chest, or, in some cases, even a beard.\n\nDrag Race in the U.K.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s signature show is already quite popular, and you will see that there are just as many self-referential jokes in this series as there are in its Yankee counterpart. Fans here are just as rabid as in the U.S., but because it airs on Netflix they haven\u2019t had the opportunity to watch the show live in gay bars \u2026 until now!\n\nThe BBC Factor\n\nDrag Race U.K. airs on BBC Three, which is not so much a channel as a streaming service with delusions of grandeur. Yes, that means that Drag Race U.K. is only available online, but being on the BBC, it will get tons of attention in a country that still basically has only five channels. Fleabag started on BBC Three, and look how that turned out!\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded enterprise, and as such is notoriously stingy, and there are certain restrictions about what its shows can and can\u2019t do. Much like PBS, there are no commercials (which might make slicing it up for ads on Logo a little awkward), but they also can\u2019t have any product placement or partnerships. That means no Jewels for Queens, no Anastasia Beverly Hills, no Al and Chuck dot travel (RIP), and no Interior Illusions Lounge.\n\nThe (Lack of) Prizes\n\nBecause the BBC is stingy and can\u2019t get someone to sponsor a prize, the winner of Drag Race U.K. only gets \u201ca trip to Los Angeles to star in their own show made by the producers of Drag Race.\u201d It\u2019s safe to assume that the winner will be paid for that series, but probably not the $100,000 that the U.S. winner gets. Also, the winner each week gets a RuPeter Badge. (English-to-American translation: \u201cbadge\u201d means a button you pin on a jacket.) This is a spoof of the Blue Peter badge, which is given out to guests and viewers of the show Blue Peter, which is like the BBC\u2019s Sesame Street. Yeah, this is a joke that only tried-and-true Brits will get. Sorry, Uncle Sam.\n\nThe New Judges\n\nYou already know Ru and Michelle. (Quick aside: Contrary to what Michelle may lead you to believe, British people don\u2019t actually universally love her, she\u2019s just \u2026 kinda here a lot.) You\u2019ll need to meet the Ross and Carson of the U.K.: Alan Carr and Graham Norton. Alan Carr is a gay comedian who hosted the talk show Alan Carr Chatty Man for seven seasons. Here he is interviewing Nicki Minaj! He\u2019s also a fixture on panel shows, which are a strange British creation where comedians sit around and do funny things for no apparent reason. He\u2019s especially good on 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, which is a game show only funny people can play. Trust me, it\u2019s better than it sounds.\n\nGraham Norton is like the Jay Leno of the U.K. except gay, Irish, and actually funny. He started his career in drag doing a show where he played Mother Teresa. A veteran talk-show host, he tried to make it in America in 2004 with a short-lived show on Comedy Central. When he returned to the U.K. he started hosting the BBC\u2019s Friday-night talk show and has been there ever since. Yes, there are only enough famous people in the U.K. for them to have a celebrity chat show once a week.\n\nThe Drag Names\n\nOne of the queens is named Cheryl Hole, which is not just cheeky because of the word hole; it\u2019s also a take on Cheryl Cole, who was a judge on The X Factor. (They tried to bring her to the U.S. for X Factor, but she got fired because no one could understand her accent, which is as thick as the Rock\u2019s biceps.) Another queen known on the show as Crystal had to change her name from Crystal Beth, for somewhat obvious reasons. Baga Chipz is a great name for a queen, but it doesn\u2019t mean what you think it means. It means a container of French fries. What you call a bag of chips, Brits call a packet of crisps. (Even worse than a confusing name, Baga has already come under fire for supporting former prime minister Theresa May and making racist statements in the past.)\n\nThe Geography\n\nThe regional accents in Britain are a lot stronger and carry more connotations than those in the U.S. In general, the harder it is for an American to understand an accent, the farther north the person is from. The north of the island is something like the south of America, generally more rural and conservative. Also know that a couple of the queens are from Essex, which is the New Jersey of England. Strangely enough, people from Essex have the same sense of tacky glamour as those from Jersey. Some things are universal.\n\nTuppence\n\nA Tuppence is a two-pence coin. It also means vagina. Don\u2019t say I never taught you nuffin, gov\u2019nah.", "description": "Why are there no prizes or sponsorships? What changes has the BBC made? Who are the new judges?
