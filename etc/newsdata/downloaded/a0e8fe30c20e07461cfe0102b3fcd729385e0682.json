Like so many acts of violence in Britain these days, it happened in a tranquil place, and was utterly unprovoked.\n\nOne moment Jeanette Carroll was walking five dogs through a scenic country park, on the outskirts of Middlesbrough, Teesside \u2014 a job she does every day to earn a few pounds.\n\nThe next she was being punched in the mouth by a middle-aged man, who went berserk simply because she had let the well-trained dogs off their leads to run through the woods.\n\nJeannette Carroll was walking her dogs near Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough when an agitated man approached her and punched her in the face. He went mad because she had let the well-trained dogs off their leads to run in the woods - and the police's response was disgraceful\n\nHe struck Mrs Carroll, 51, such a vicious blow that she was knocked unconscious and three of her teeth were loosened, but she managed to dial 999 on her mobile phone.\n\nIt was a despicable and cowardly act, yet it was the police\u2019s disgraceful response to her distress call that makes this story even more disturbing.\n\nIndeed, even in a week when the reputation of British policing has sunk to new depths, following the report into the Metropolitan Police\u2019s appallingly mishandled investigation into a non-existent VIP paedophile ring, it almost beggars belief. For it is Mrs Carroll\u2019s misfortune to live in an area where the police force is so dysfunctional that it makes the troubled Met appear to be a paragon of efficiency by comparison.\n\nA damning report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, branded Cleveland Police to be \u2018inadequate\u2019 by every benchmark of policing standards, two weeks ago (file image)\n\nA damning report by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, published two weeks ago, branded Cleveland Police to be \u2018inadequate\u2019 by every benchmark of policing standards.\n\nIt is the first time such a poor rating has been awarded, which must make Cleveland the worst-performing force in England and Wales. Given the many failings of the police service as a whole, this is quite some indictment.\n\nBut back to Mrs Carroll. Incredibly, when she got through to the control-room, the call-handler told her the assault \u2018wasn\u2019t serious enough\u2019 to warrant an emergency turn-out \u2014 though her attacker would surely have faced a charge of actual bodily harm, at the very least, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of five years in prison.\n\nMs Carroll was told her assault 'wasn't serious enough' by Cleveland Police (pictured) and this meant she would not receive an emergency turn-out\n\nInstead, though she was bleeding profusely and could barely function, she was advised to drive herself to hospital and contact the police again after her wounds had been treated.\n\nSince the thug did not bother to run away \u2014 and also attacked a park warden who tried to intervene \u2014 Mrs Carroll believes he would have been arrested if a patrol car had been dispatched speedily.\n\nYet she had to wait for eight days \u2014 yes, eight \u2014 before an officer came to take her statement. To make matters worse, she says, she felt belittled by his \u2018patronising\u2019 manner.\n\nCleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, Barry Coppinger said he will not be standing for re-election next year\n\nMrs Carroll is sure she could identify the culprit, and believes he lives less than 200 yards from her Middlesbrough home. Yet he remains at liberty. She still wears a brace on her teeth, can only drink soup and takes painkillers.\n\n\u2018I have always been very supportive of the police, and I know how difficult their job is because my nephew is a police officer, and I\u2019m super-proud of him,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But the way I\u2019ve been treated really is shocking.\u2019\n\nEveryone who reads her story will doubtless agree.\n\nMiddlesbrough's mayor Andy Preston has said the force has struggled protect the 740 children at Ayresome Primary School. He says it has sometimes gone into 'lockdown' because intruders have come in with knives\n\nAccording to HM Inspectorate, the failings of Cleveland Police are so serious they are deemed to be placing lives at risk. The force has now been placed under the national oversight process, the police equivalent of \u2018special measures\u2019.\n\nThough it is one of the nation\u2019s smaller forces, serving just 500,000 people \u2014 the majority living in the towns of Middlesbrough, Stockton on Tees, Redcar and Hartlepool \u2014 its demise is a matter of pressing concern to us all.\n\nFor at a time when the police appear to be losing the crime war on so many fronts \u2014 county-lines drug gangs, Romanian burglary syndicates, rampant knife crime \u2014 Cleveland, with its myriad shortcomings, might be regarded as a microcosm of our creaking police service.\n\nOf course, Boris Johnson and hard-line Home Secretary Priti Patel have pledged to turn the tide by stiffening sentences and recruiting 20,000 extra officers. They promise that the Tories will regain their reputation as the party of law and order.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel has pledged to turn the tide by stiffening sentences and recruiting 20,000 extra officers\n\nYet to gauge the enormity of this task they should take a train to Teesside, as I did last week (passing the new Chief Constable Richard Lewis, who was heading in the opposite direction, having been summoned to London to attend a mandatory seminar designed to improve his force\u2019s performance).\n\nThey might start by walking down Parliament Road, a busy, multi-cultural thoroughfare in Middlesbrough town centre, with takeaway food shops, convenience shops, and a wonderfully old-fashioned fishmonger.\n\nIn bygone years, this was the sort of street where order was kept by the presence of a firm but friendly bobby.\n\nFantasist Carl Beech made up a series of claims about public figures, prompting a bungling police probe. The police watchdog today stood by its finding that no officers were to blame\n\nToday, those who live and work here tell me, officers seldom venture here to investigate a crime, much less walk the beat, so they police the community themselves. This can be a precarious business. In the corner newsagent he has run for 19 years, Usman Wajid shows me footage of two shoplifters filmed that day by his CCTV cameras.\n\n\u2018We let this guy go with a warning because he only took some jam tarts, and pleaded with us that he needed to feed his family,\u2019 he says, gesturing to a man slipping a packet furtively under his coat.\n\n\u2018We didn\u2019t catch the other one. But sometimes they\u2019ll turn rough, so we have to pin them down and grab the stuff back, and it can turn nasty.\u2019\n\nWhy not hold them and call the police? He shoots me a glance that suggests I must have beamed down from Mars. \u2018We gave up calling the police for help a long time ago,\u2019 he says.\n\nThis was the cue for Mr Wajid\u2019s young cousin to describe, indignantly, how Cleveland Police treated him when he discovered his hospitalised father\u2019s house had been burgled. Not only did they refuse to attend the scene, he says, but he was admonished for calling 999 for a crime that was \u2018not high risk\u2019.\n\nOpposite the newsagent stands Ayresome Primary School, a community pillar since the days of inkwells and fountain pens. With its austere Edwardian facade, it looks reassuringly safe, but according to Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston, its staff struggle to protect the 740 children.\n\n\u2018The school sometimes goes into lockdown because intruders have come in with knives,\u2019 he told me grimly. \u2018Staff won\u2019t go out for a sandwich because they get abused. The headmistress has reported these incidents to the police. Sometimes they come . . . the next day.\u2019\n\nThe school did not respond to requests for a comment.\n\nThe Independent mayor, who made his fortune as a City hedge-fund manager before returning to Teesside, where he was raised, remains proud of this blue-collar sprawl, which once boasted world-renowned steel, chemical and ship-building industries.\n\nYet he portrays Middlesbrough as a town where the daytime streets are now plagued by drug-addicts, beggars and prostitutes, untroubled by the police.\n\nAnd he cites the plight of decent residents, such as \u2018Matt\u2019, a single parent whose life, and that of his four-year-old son, is being made hell by the drug-dealers and sex workers dossing in the house next door. It\u2019s a familiar story. The police do nothing, so Matt no longer even bothers to complain.\n\nCleveland, with its myriad shortcomings, might be regarded as a microcosm of our creaking police service. The force has been placed under the national oversight process, the police equivalent of \u2018special measures\u2019 (file image)\n\nOther locals do, however, especially when they discover, as those in the Acklam Road area of Middlesbrough have this week, that Britain\u2019s first \u2018shooting gallery\u2019 is set to open on their doorsteps.\n\nTo widespread outrage, residents say they only found out about the new initiative at the clinic, in which 15 of the area\u2019s worst heroin addicts will be provided with diamorphine to inject twice a day in a safe environment, on Facebook. It is the brainchild of the beleaguered Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner, Barry Coppinger, whose office will foot a third of the \u00a3440,000 a year cost of the clinic.\n\nMayor Preston lays some of the blame for the local force\u2019s failings on Mr Coppinger \u2014 \u2018a nice guy, but out of his depth\u2019 \u2014 who has announced that he won\u2019t stand for re-election next year. The local newspaper has demanded that he must resign.\n\nHe also points to a crony culture in which those in authority \u2014 the commissioner, MP, councillors \u2014 never criticise anyone\u2019s handling of police issues, because they are all Labour Party \u2018mates\u2019.\n\nHe speaks optimistically of making the streets safer by boosting the number of \u2018neighbourhood wardens\u2019 from 12 to 60, equipping them with body-cameras, and giving them powers to issue fines of up to \u00a31,000 for anti-social behaviour. However, the Inspectorate\u2019s report suggests it will need more than this to safeguard the people of Cleveland, whose police service is said to have \u2018declined significantly\u2019 since the last inspection two years ago.\n\nFewer resources are dedicated to community policing; the force is \u2018without a clear plan or direction\u2019; and though it is good at fighting organised crime, it \u2018needs to improve\u2019 on tackling the everyday offenders who cause untold fear and misery.\n\nThese so-called \u2018lesser offences\u2019 are not always allocated to trained staff, the report says, nor are they investigated thoroughly or supervised efficiently (as Jeanette Carroll knows all too well).\n\nThere are \u2018serious concerns\u2019 that the force doesn\u2019t adequately protect vulnerable people, and in Middlesbrough \u2014 which has some of the country\u2019s most deprived wards \u2014 there are many of those.\n\nThe desperate cry for help might come from a woman being beaten by her partner, or a frantic parent whose child is missing. Yet all too often it is simply forwarded to a front-desk answering machine.\n\nHMICFRS inspector Mike Gormley, who led the review of Cleveland Police, told me the failure to identify and prioritise such calls was placing people in danger.\n\nBut the report highlights many more failings: Cleveland treats the public and its own workforce poorly, and misuses resources.\n\nOfficers of superintendent rank are often uninspiring leaders who fail to act as role models, and conceal the true extent of problems from the top brass; the force\u2019s \u2018ethical behaviour\u2019 is unsatisfactory.\n\nAnd, unsurprisingly, in a force mired in scandals for decades and which has seen six chief constables come and go in the past six years, the Inspectorate says action is needed to \u2018root out corruption\u2019.\n\nAmong senior officers dismissed for wrongful conduct is former chief constable Sean Price. A female chief inspector with whom he was having a relationship (they are now married) was subsequently arrested for drunkenness and allowed to resign. She denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThen, last year, a detective inspector \u2014 in the force\u2019s professional standards department \u2014resigned following accusations that he coerced a junior officer to have sex.\n\nIn a particularly ironic episode, Cleveland Police were also caught hacking into journalists\u2019 phones. Seven officers were served with disciplinary notices.\n\nWhich brings us to Mike Veale, whose lack of judgment might be regarded as the precursor to the Operation Midland debacle.\n\nDuring his time as Wiltshire\u2019s police chief, he was responsible for launching the much-cricitised investigation into allegations made by Carl Beech, alias \u2018Nick\u2019, that former prime minister Edward Heath was part of a child-sex ring.\n\nMr Heath\u2019s supporters claimed the investigation was one-sided, but Mr Veale has insisted it was even-handed and in the public interest. A report later concluded that, had he been alive, Mr Heath would have been interviewed under caution for alleged serious sex offences against young boys.\n\nFor reasons best explained by crime commissioner Coppinger, when Wiltshire did not renew Veale\u2019s contract, he was appointed to take charge of Cleveland.\n\nHe didn\u2019t last long, resigning after being accused of a disciplinary breach \u2014 yet to be uncovered \u2014 of \u2018a serious nature\u2019. And so this sorry saga rolls on.\n\nIn the Inspectorate\u2019s report, the shamed police force offers several excuses for its abject performance. It points to the area\u2019s social problems, saying it has Britain\u2019s highest number of asylum-seekers, and an increase in violence that mirrors the national trend. Inevitably, it also mentions spending cuts, which have seen the force\u2019s annual budget reduced by \u00a335 million, and lost them 488 officers.\n\nI\u2019m afraid this just won\u2019t wash. How can they plead poverty when neighbouring Durham, whose funds have been similarly reduced, has been Britain\u2019s best-performing force for four years running?\n\nAnd consider this fact: in recent years, Cleveland is reckoned to have spent at least \u00a340 million investigating, and paying-off, its own officers!\n\nSo what is the truth behind Cleveland Police\u2019s cataclysmic decline? After all, it hasn\u2019t always been this way. Formed as one of the new \u2018metro forces\u2019, in 1974, from parts of Durham and North Yorkshire constabularies, Cleveland developed a reputation as one of the most effective and innovative forces in the country.\n\nCredited with much of its success was Ray Mallon, a ferociously-driven detective whose adaptation of the Zero Tolerance policing methods pioneered in New York had slashed crime rates, and brought him national renown. Headline writers called him \u2018Robocop\u2019.\n\nOn the eve of the 1997 general election, burnishing his fabled, and ultimately hollow, mantra \u2014 \u2018tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u2019\u2014 Tony Blair (accompanied by the actress Helen Mirren) dashed to Teesside to stage a photo-op with Mallon.\n\nHowever, \u2018Robocop\u2019 was abruptly stopped in his tracks. Despised and distrusted by envious superiors, he was accused of misconduct \u2014 unjustly, I wrote, after investigating his case \u2014 and suspended.\n\nAfter fighting for four years to clear his name, he admitted to 14 regulatory offences, though only, he has always maintained, so that he could resign in time to stand in Middlesbrough\u2019s first mayoral election, in 2002, which he won by a landslide.\n\nMallon was among 61 officers suspended during Operation Lancet, one of the most protracted, and many would say futile, police corruption inquires ever staged.\n\nAnd according to some former Cleveland officers, the bitter divisions and climate of suspicion it created persist to this day.\n\nAmong informed observers who believe those tumultuous years contributed to Cleveland\u2019s current woes is Jack Straw, home secretary in Blair\u2019s first Cabinet.\n\nIn a letter to The Times last week, Mr Straw said Cleveland Police had become \u2018systematically hopeless\u2019 during his term of office, and was now \u2018worse\u2019. He regretted not merging the force with an adjacent police authority.\n\nMr Straw told me: \u2018I know from my experience and knowledge that it [the force\u2019s malign culture] has been going on for 20 years.\u2019\n\nHe is convinced it is now beyond salvation.\n\nMallon, who stepped down as mayor in 2013, and now does charity work for Middlesbrough FC\u2019s foundation, is similarly dismayed.\n\nWhen I met him last month, he said the first thing the police needed to do was return to the rigorous standards that he once set.\n\nHe describes a force where no-one dares use \u2018proactive policing\u2019 methods, as he did when \u2018camping on the doorstep\u2019 of known burglars, and where officers are \u2018scared of their own shadow\u2019 for fear of offending against some politically correct doctrine laid down by professional standards mandarins.\n\nYet it is when he turns to the behaviour and image of Cleveland\u2019s Police officers that he becomes most animated.\n\n\u2018The other day I saw an inspector address the TV cameras after a court case, and he had no hat on, no jacket, no tie, and his hands in his pockets,\u2019 he says incredulously. \u2018That told me everything I needed to know about Cleveland Police.\n\n\u2018You might not think it\u2019s important for a police officer to wear a hat, but to me it\u2019s vital. It gives them a presence and makes them stand out from the crowd, so it is a crime prevention tool.\u2019\n\nAnother bugbear is the way, he claims, Cleveland Police routinely flout rules which apply to ordinary members of the public. \u2018They\u2019ll park in disabled bays, and they aren\u2019t supposed to do it unless they\u2019re answering an emergency.\n\n\u2018Then you\u2019ll see kids riding their bikes on the pavement, and a police officer can\u2019t be bothered to tell them to get off.\n\n\u2018These might seem like small things, but they all add up. Zero Tolerance was just about not walking by. It\u2019s about policing the streets, not de-policing them.\u2019\n\nAs so often, Robocop has his finger on the pulse.\n\nOn exiting Middlesbrough station earlier that day, I had been surprised to see a police car abandoned in a space for the disabled for 15 minutes. According to an irked taxi-driver, the police regularly park there while buying coffee, but a Cleveland spokesman said the female officer who returned to the car had been answering a \u2018concern for safety\u2019 call.\n\nAs Cleveland\u2019s new chief constable, Mr Lewis, only took his post in April \u2014 after rising through the ranks in Wales \u2014 it is too early to say whether he will prove more effective than his predecessors. So far, however, he has impressed observers. And has won support for his candour, admitting, for example, that the failure to dispatch officers in attack-victim Jeanette Carroll\u2019s case was a mistake, and \u2018exactly the type of thing\u2019 flagged up by the HMICFRS report.\n\nMr Lewis said: \u2018This report echoes my initial assessment of the force and will act as a line in the sand. Improvements have already been made and I take full responsibility for driving through the changes that are so obviously needed. We do not underestimate the challenges ahead of us.\u2019\n\nHe urges people to give him enough time to bring the organisation back to scratch. They have no choice. But during my time in Middlesbrough it became very evident that the public\u2019s patience is fast running out with Cleveland Police.\n\nJack Straw is not alone in believing that this shambolic force has had too many second chances, and that it would be in everyone\u2019s best interests for its flickering blue light to be extinguished.\n\nMeanwhile, for police services across the country, the struggle to maintain standards at a time when challenges grow ever greater, continues.\n\nAdditional reporting: Kevin Donald.", "description": "DAVID JONES: Cleveland Police has been branded 'inadequate' - as its mistakes include telling assault victim Jeanette Carroll that her incident 'wasn't serious enough' for emergency turn-out.", "authors": ["David Jones For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/22/19608144-0-image-a-45_1570829046037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
