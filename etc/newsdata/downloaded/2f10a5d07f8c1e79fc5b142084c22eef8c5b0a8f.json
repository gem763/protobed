It\u2019s our historic water tower, a feature so uniquely Brainerd you may have to be from here to be charmed by it (and even then, many are not). Last week, we hosted the entire Strong Towns team in Brainerd, and the consensus reaction seemed to fall somewhere between underwhelmed and confusion. You really like it?\n\nYes, I love it. As a kid, I remember dreaming of the castle tower in the middle of town. I always wanted to go up there and play. It\u2019s the most dominating feature in the skyline. I can see it from here at the office, lit up at night. Like most things my ancestors and their peers did here before World War II, I love the hubris of it. Let\u2019s not build a water tower; let\u2019s build a castle water tower.\n\nHere\u2019s the history of it as printed in the local paper:\n\nDesigned by L.P. Wolff, the Brainerd historic water tower was constructed between 1919-22 when a new water system was implemented in the city. It stands at 134 feet high, at one time featuring a maximum capacity of 300,000 gallons housed in a bowl created by a single pouring of concrete.\n\nIt's one of two water towers by the architect still standing\u2014the other being the Pipestone water tower\u2014and it was the first all-concrete elevated water depository used by a municipality in the United States. Retired in 1959-60 from use, the historic water tower evolved from practical to symbolic purposes, elevated to a status as an icon of the city, an imposing presence on the Brainerd skyline and an image emblemized on the city's seal. It was added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1974.\n\nIn a Strong Towns mindset, it\u2019s not difficult to understand what those 1920s Brainerd residents were doing. The main artery in and out of town was the railroad. The tower sat right next to the depot (R.I.P., 1968) amid of collection of the most valuable real estate, and nicest structures, in the area. If you\u2019re going to spend the money on a water tower, you should put in that fractional bit of extra capital to make the real estate around it more valuable.\n\nToday, surrounded by stroads, a strip mall and parking lots, the historic water tower comes across as a white elephant. That was not the case back then. I think about my ancestors and feel more than a modest amount of shame\u2014and some anger\u2014over what we did with what they gave us. There is a sentimental obligation in my soul to not let this structure go.\n\nYet it serves no real purpose beyond the sentimental. And with us committing this summer to another generation\u2014or more\u2014that has to live with a nasty stroad running through the center of town, it\u2019s going to take a lot of extra effort for the city to evolve into a productive place again around this water tower. If the historic water tower is going to transform from white elephant at the intersection of stroad and stroad to the symbolic center of a functional and strong downtown Brainerd, a lot of heavy lifting is going to have to take place.\n\nAnd that heavy lifting is going to require capital, money we don\u2019t seem likely to have even if we forgo borrowing an additional $3 million or more to fix the tower. Question #10 on the Strong Towns Strength Test asks whether the city spends more than 10% of its locally-generated revenue on debt service. The last time I calculated that for Brainerd, we were over 100%. I know things have changed and some of that debt has come off the books, but I doubt that much of it has. And while the list of other critical obligations grows each day, I lack confidence that local government aid\u2014that is, annual aid from the state that makes up a huge portion of our budget\u2014will survive the next recession.\n\nIt seems the matter is going to be on the ballot this fall as a non-binding referendum. While the oddly specific cost estimate for something so non-routine raises all kinds of red flags for me\u2014$2,443,238 is the kind of silly number that destroys credibility\u2014 it\u2019s hard for me to see myself not voting for it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s hard to see me not regretting that vote afterward. That's one of the many costs of living in a fragile place.\n\nTop image from Adam Brown Photography (Chuck's favorite local photographer)", "description": "When your community is financially fragile, you lose options.
