The White House and State Department had ordered them not to appear.\n\nIt was unclear what Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state responsible for U.S. policy toward six former Soviet republics including Ukraine, was telling lawmakers.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Kent raised concerns with colleagues as far back as March about Giuliani pressuring Ukraine to pursue investigations into Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nDIPLOMATS TESTIFY\n\nMarie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, on Friday accused the Trump administration in testimony of recalling her in May based on false claims.\n\nFiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former Russia adviser, told lawmakers on Monday that she and her then-boss, former national security adviser John Bolton, were alarmed this summer by efforts to force Ukraine to investigate Biden and other rivals and advised her to notify a National Security Council lawyer, according to a source familiar with her testimony.\n\nGeorge Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian Affairs, arrives to testify at a closed-door deposition as part of the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nHill told lawmakers that Bolton characterized Giuliani as \u201ca hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up,\u201d according to two sources familiar with her testimony. A Bolton spokeswoman said he would have no comment on the testimony.\n\nGordon Sondland, a Trump political donor appointed as the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who was involved in the Ukraine discussions, is due to testify later in the week in response to a congressional subpoena.\n\nGiuliani had faced a Tuesday deadline to produce the requested documents. His lawyer, Jon Sale, said the documents were protected by legal principles that protect attorney-client communications and presidential communications.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be an unconstitutional, baseless, and illegitimate \u2018impeachment inquiry,\u2019\u201d Sale wrote, echoing language the White House used last week.\n\nPence\u2019s lawyer, Matthew E. Morgan, also cited the White House\u2019s response, saying the House had not voted to authorize the inquiry. Democratic leaders have said no vote is necessary.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN DENIES WRONGDOING\n\nThe investigation is focused on the July call in which Trump pressed Zelenskiy to have Ukraine officials investigate Biden and his businessman son, Hunter Biden, who had been on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nHunter Biden, 49, denied doing anything improper here in past work for the company but acknowledged he had benefited professionally from his father's political career in an interview with ABC News that aired on Tuesday.\n\nJoe Biden has denied Trump\u2019s allegations of corruption.\n\nDemocrats have accused Trump of pressuring a vulnerable U.S. ally to dig up dirt on Biden after withholding $391 million in U.S. security aid intended to help combat Russian-backed separatists in the eastern part of Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to investigate. Trump eventually allowed the aid.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing and defended his request to Zelenskiy during the phone call, which prompted a formal whistleblower complaint by a person with a U.S. intelligence agency.\n\nIf the Democratic-controlled House votes to approve articles of impeachment - formal charges - the Republican-controlled Senate would then hold a trial on whether to remove the president from office.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nAccording to State Department emails seen by Reuters, diplomat Kent told colleagues that Yovanovitch had become the target of a \u201cclassic disinformation operation.\u201d Yovanovitch on Friday denied Giuliani\u2019s allegations that she provided a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d to Ukrainian officials to protect Biden and others.\n\n\u201cOne key sign of it being fake is that most of the names are misspelled in English - we would never spell most that way,\u201d Kent said in the email to colleagues.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Tuesday they will not cooperate with a U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441153399&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1D2", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
