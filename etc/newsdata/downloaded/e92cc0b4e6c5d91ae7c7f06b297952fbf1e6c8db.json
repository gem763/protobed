At its core, it is born out of the cold calculation that Trump probably cannot stop the Democrat-led House from impeaching him, so the real goal is to delegitimize the process.\n\nJust last week, Trump acknowledged that Democrats appeared to have enough votes to impeach him in the House and that he was counting on the Republican-controlled Senate to acquit him. By presenting the inquiry as the work of an unholy alliance of deep-state saboteurs and Democratic hatchet-men, he hopes to undermine its credibility, forestall Republican defections and energize his voters heading into next year\u2019s reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cAs a general matter, painting the process as highly partisan should rally the GOP and Trump base, as those groups will see the current inquiry as merely a continuation of the past three years,\u201d said Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a Washington research organization, and a student of conservative thought.\n\nBut it may also harden opposition to Trump, bolstering the impression that he considers himself above the law. That could build support for an article of impeachment that charges him with obstructing Congress in addition to any related to his effort to pressure Ukraine for damaging information about his Democratic adversaries.\n\nThe eight-page letter signed by Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and sent to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats outlined a bevy of grievances about the House inquiry, some procedural and others political.\n\nIt argued that \u201cthis purported \u2018impeachment inquiry\u2019\u201d was not valid because the House did not vote to authorize it, as it did in the cases of Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton, with Pelosi taking it upon herself instead to declare the existence of an impeachment process by fiat. It complained that Republicans have not been granted subpoena power of their own and that the president\u2019s lawyers have not been allowed to attend closed-door interviews, cross-examine witnesses or call their own to testify.\n\nBut it also threw in a hodgepodge of Trump\u2019s favorite objections, essentially memorializing some of his many Twitter blasts at Rep. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., who is leading the inquiry and has become the president\u2019s chief target.\n\n\u201cYou look at all the irregularities, you can come to the conclusion that this is an illicit hearing,\u201d Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cThis is the first time that a president hasn\u2019t had the ability to have his party to call witnesses in the preliminary phase. It sounds like they\u2019re singling him out for unfair treatment.\u201d\n\nConstitutional scholars, though, were not impressed. \u201cIt looks like a pathetic attempt to make a legal argument when the president is really expressing rage at the Congress for trying to stop him,\u201d said Corey Brettschneider, an impeachment expert at Brown University. \u201cWhat\u2019s sad about it is it\u2019s so poorly drafted and the legal arguments are so nonexistent that you wonder who\u2019s advising the president.\u201d\n\nJack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, said Trump\u2019s position was more political than constitutional.\n\n\u201cThe White House letter\u2019s legal objections don\u2019t have merit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe letter, like the \u2018official impeachment inquiry\u2019 itself, is a hardball tactic designed to achieve maximum political advantage\u201d before the public.\n\nIndeed, it could ultimately end up being a negotiating position. Trump, who on Tuesday denounced the \u201ckangaroo court, told reporters Wednesday that he could change his mind and cooperate if the House voted to formally authorize the impeachment inquiry. \u201cYeah, that sounds OK,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would if they give us our rights. It depends.\u201d", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Breathtaking in scope, defiant in tone, the White House's refusal to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry amounts to an unabashed challenge to America's long-standing constitutional order.In effect, President Donald Trump is making the sweeping assertion that he can ignore", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UKyRKennDVibPDEHz_wqmw--~B/aD0yOTIxO3c9NDM4MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/8683d73072427d0ed54f8914ed871939", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
