We didn't start well, then we recovered and we could have gone in ahead at the break,\" said Mancini, according to the Italian Football Association's website.\n\n\"Their sending off made it tough for us in the end because it meant they defended with 10 men for the entire second half and closed up any space. Things would have been better if they had remained as 11.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Euro 2020 - the stadiums Show all 13 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Former Manchester City manager Mancini felt the opposition's superior fitness levels were a factor in his side labouring to success.\n\n\"We're back together after four months, the boys have only played two games in the league and it's normal to have encountered difficulties,\" said Mancini. \"A lot of the Armenia players are in the middle of their seasons, physically they were slightly ahead of us.\"\n\nTorino striker Belotti was particularly wasteful in front of goal and also had two efforts ruled out for offside, one incorrectly, while Federico Bernardeschi struck the crossbar.\n\nBelotti, who broke a national team drought dating back to May 2018, has been in good form for his club this term, claiming six goals in Europa League qualifying and one in Serie A.\n\nThe 25-year-old admitted he should have been more potent on Thursday evening and is determined to establish himself as Mancini's first-choice centre forward.\n\n\"We have to hold our hands up and say that we missed too many chances, myself included,\" said Belotti. \"There were two moments where I missed the target or didn't react quickly enough.\n\n\"When I'm given the chance to take to the pitch I have to be ready. Scoring goals is simply something that us strikers have inside us, we just have to stay focused and express our quality on the pitch.\n\n\"I'm happy with my goal but the team deserves the credit and for that I'd like to thank all of my team-mates. Now I don't want to stop and I have to do everything that the coach asks of me.\"\n\nPA", "description": "Roberto Mancini claimed it would have been easier for Italy to beat Armenia had they not played the entire second half of their Euro 2020 qualifier against 10 men.
