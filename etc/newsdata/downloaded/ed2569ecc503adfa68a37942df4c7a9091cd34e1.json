I consider it a bigger threat than the terrorists I\u2019ve fought.\u201d\n\nMattis frets about rising intergenerational debt, which he called but one symptom of that bigger, defining problem\u2013\u2013\u201cthe lack of fundamental friendliness, fundamental respect, as if we don\u2019t even believe that the person we disagree with might be right once in awhile.\u201d Lamenting the \u201cscorching kind of no-holds-barred fight against each other,\u201d he granted that harsh insults are perhaps inevitable in political campaigns, but said that after Election Day everyone is supposed to come together.\n\n\u201cWhen governing begins, it\u2019s all about unity,\u201d he said.\n\nMattis occupies an unusual place in our culture in that he is held in relatively high esteem across party lines. Partly for that reason, there is a hunger, among those who see Trump as a force for disunity, for figures like Mattis to speak out and criticize the president. Some even feel that figures like Mattis have an affirmative duty and responsibility to speak out against aberrant presidential behavior.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, pressed Mattis to weigh in on Trump\u2019s recent behavior, and when Mattis declined to do so, asked him to explain his silence. \u201cWhat is keeping you from talking in the blunt terms that we\u2019ve come to expect from a blunt general about the current policies and behaviors of this administration?\u201d Goldberg asked him. \u201cWhat is it that keeps you from doing that?\u201d\n\nRead: The man who couldn\u2019t take it anymore\n\nMattis answered bluntly:\n\nIf you take the word you just used\u2013\u2013current situation\u2013\u2013there\u2019s a tradition going back to George Washington that military people and those in the departments do not make political assessments of a sitting commander in chief. This is a long-standing tradition. And there\u2019s a reason for it. We have civilian control of the military.\n\nGranted, he said, he is now a civilian, and he held the civilian position of Cabinet secretary in the Trump administration. However, \u201cwhen I just got out of the car here and walked into this building, the young man in charge of security who let me through the door said, \u2018Welcome General Mattis,\u2019\u201d he related. \u201cNow I may agree or disagree with how he\u2019s characterizing me, but that\u2019s my reputation, that was my role for 40-odd years.\u201d And he felt an associated duty:\n\nThe French have a saying called a devoir de r\u00e9serve\u2013\u2013a duty of reserve. We have tens of thousands of troops deployed right now protecting this experiment in democracy. The last thing they need is for someone to break under the current passions we see in the country and start speaking out.\n\nWhile some may argue that Trump\u2019s behavior justifies an unusual response, Mattis sees the \u201cduty of reserve\u201d as something that\u2019s especially vital now, \u201cat a time when we\u2019re awash in change and passions.\u201d Taken as a whole, his remarks might be seen as urging all Americans to reflect on whether they are living up to their \u201cduty of reserve,\u201d their duty to refrain not from forthright or even passionate political speech, but from indulgent rhetoric or behavior that needlessly divides.", "description": "The former defense secretary said the greatest threat to national security is domestic disunity.", "authors": ["Conor Friedersdorf", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/9_26_Main_Stage_1676/facebook.jpg?1569530849", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
