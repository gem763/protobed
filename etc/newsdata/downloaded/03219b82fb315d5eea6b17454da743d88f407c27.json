Three officials dissented in this week\u2019s vote, the most \u201cno\u201d votes at a single meeting since 2016.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President James Bullard, one of those who broke with the consensus, earlier Friday made the case for a more-aggressive half-point cut.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Bullard: Dissent was due in part to worries about slowing economy\n\nAt the same time, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the rate cut was unnecessary and created bad side effects.\n\nSee: Fed\u2019s Rosengren sees risks \u2018people are taking on too much leverage\u2019\n\nIn an interview on CNBC, Clarida said the \u201ccenter of gravity\u201d on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee was for the second quarter-point cut in as many months.\n\nClarida tried to paint the dissents in a positive light, saying the disagreements were actually a sign of strength.\n\nEconomists said the divisive debate makes the outlook for interest rates cloudy at a pivotal time for the central bank, with talk of a recession louder than at any time in the decade-long expansion.\n\nClarida stressed the FOMC would make interest-rate decisions on a \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d basis going forward.\n\nBut reading between the lines, there was a dovish bias to many of Clarida\u2019s comments.\n\nTom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, said Clarida is \u201cdefinitely\u201d one of the seven Fed officials who indicated in the dot plot that another rate cut would be appropriate this year.\n\nFirst of all, Clarida downplayed the risk of financial instability from an easy policy stance that Rosengren had stressed.\n\nRight now, the majority of Fed officials do not see elevated risks of financial instability, he said.\n\nAnd secondly, the Fed vice chairman highlighted the grim global economic picture.\n\n\u201cWe clearly have a slowing global economy\u201d that is \u201cbroader\u201d than the trade tensions between the U.S. and China, Clarida said.\n\n\u201cThere is a slowdown in global capital spending and global manufacturing and also some pretty important disinflationary forces,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd these factors have been getting worse since the beginning of the year, he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development downgraded its assessment of the global economy to the worst growth rate since the financial crisis.\n\nSee: Global economy growing at slowest pace since recession, OECD says\n\nStocks DJIA, -0.59% SPX, -0.49% sank in late trading Friday after conflicting reports on U.S. and China trade negotiations.", "description": "Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday defended the central bank\u2019s decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR741_clarid_ZG_20190920103615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
