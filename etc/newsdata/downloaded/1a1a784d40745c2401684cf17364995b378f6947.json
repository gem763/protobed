The rain was absolutely driving as well so it wasn't the most pleasant of times but we knew the children were safe.\"\n\nShe said the children had all been taught what to do in case of a fire.\n\nBBC\n\nNottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service said the swift actions of the children \"undoubtedly saved themselves and more damage to the property\".\n\nThe cause of the fire is believed to be a fault with the tumble dryer's control panel. Amazingly, all the washing inside the machine wasn't damaged.\n\nThe family is currently staying in their caravan until more is known about the damage caused to the house.", "description": "BBC News", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1"}
