The groin is the best place but you have to prepare and clean the area.\n\n\u201cIn a hurry, with an assistant pushing really, really hard on the aorta to reduce the massive blood loss, we threw some prep solution on to the groin and then cut the skin to find the artery.\u201d\n\nAs there was some blood, Nashef used an electric device to cauterise it \u2013 a medical technique which involves burning to mitigate bleeding.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the prep solution hadn\u2019t dried. The flames reached the operating light. We managed to put them out using the drapes,\u201dhe said.\n\n\u201cTo cut a long story short, the patient did absolutely fine but, he was an 80-year-old man, he was rather bemused to find he\u2019d had a full Brazilian.\u201d\n\nThe surgeon said he was congratulating himself on an amazing save but was nevertheless summoned to management and told what had happened was an NHS \u201cnever event\u201d. Never events, such as taking out the wrong kidney, are \u2013 as the name suggests \u2013 events that should never happen.\n\nThe never event in this case referred to not burning or scalding patients, although Nashef argued the rule did not apply because the guidelines say it applies to kettles. There was no kettle involved in his operating room, he insisted.\n\nNashef, better known to Guardian crossword solvers as Philistine, was talking about his book, The Angina Monologues, sharing a stage at Cheltenham with fellow cardiac surgeon Stephen Westaby, author of The Knife\u2019s Edge.\n\nThe discussion touched on how far along the psychopathic spectrum, how fearless and inhibited, surgeons should be.\n\nNashef said the quality was more important in surgeons practising in the early days of heart surgery when it was only carried out as a last resort. \u201cThe surgeons who took the chance to do that had to have supreme self-confidence in themselves.\n\n\u201cNow, we do not need to be so psychopathic. A good heart operation now should be as boring as possible, where nothing unexpected happens, where everything goes according to plan.\u201d\n\nThe session was interrupted for five minutes when a man in the audience appeared to faint, even before Nashef\u2019s fire-fighting story. Fortunately there were doctors \u2013 or rather surgeons \u2013 in the house, both of whom went down from the stage and diagnosed him as fine.", "description": "Samer Nashef, author of The Angina Monologues, tells of coronary bypass that didn\u2019t go to plan", "authors": ["Mark Brown"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48bcdc1773673035e0ba354ed0fdc1051750db08/0_1723_2704_1622/master/2704.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=20c3ec5e429942eb0102c55b0935da2e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
