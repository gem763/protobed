British lawmakers forced him to ask for a delay rather than to lead Britain out of the European Union in October without any deal in place to buffer the way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m recommending the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted Wednesday, saying he had spoken to Johnson by phone to explain his reasoning. Under the likeliest terms of an extension, Britain could leave earlier than the end of January if it approves the withdrawal deal before that and says it wants to go.\n\nBut it was not fully resolved whether E.U. leaders would go along with Tusk. France, in particular, has been deeply skeptical about repeated delays to the departure, with President Emmanuel Macron questioning whether the bloc\u2019s being flexible takes too much pressure off British lawmakers to act.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has been an important voice in the Brexit discussions, said Wednesday that he would support the extension until Jan. 31.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJohnson has floated the idea of holding a general election, but it remains unclear how that would fit into a Brexit delay, and for now, E.U. leaders aren\u2019t showing much interest in factoring that into their decision.\n\nE.U. ambassadors will meet later Wednesday for a preliminary discussion about the delay request, and they will take further action on Friday. If the remaining 27 E.U. countries are comfortable with putting off Brexit until the end of January, they could agree to it on Friday without further discussion. If not, E.U. leaders would have to discuss it in person, probably on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe need clarity on the next steps and a political clarification to stop the toxic uncertainty that is hurting European citizens, millions of families and businesses,\u201d French E.U. affairs minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin told the French parliament on Tuesday. \u201cAn extension is requested: What for? With what justifications? We know that time alone will not bring the solution, but a political decision. We cannot extend this situation indefinitely.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there was widespread expectation that a delay of some sort would be granted and that Britain will not crash out of the bloc next week.\n\nSome British lawmakers told Johnson on Wednesday to get over it.\n\n\u201cWill my right honorable friend get over his disappointment and accept that October 31 is now Halloween and it is devoid of any symbolic or political content and will fade away into historical memory very rapidly,\u201d said Kenneth Clarke, a longtime Conservative lawmaker and senior member of the House of Commons.\n\nThere was little progress in London on Wednesday, as Johnson met with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn but failed to agree on a timetable to move the Brexit bill forward.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cJeremy Corbyn reiterated Labour\u2019s offer to the prime minister to agree [to] a reasonable timetable to debate, scrutinise and amend the withdrawal agreement bill, and restated that Labour will support a general election when the threat of a no-deal crash-out is off the table,\u201d a Labour Party spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nBooth reported from London. Quentin Ari\u00e8s in Brussels contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "British lawmakers forced Johnson to ask for an extension rather than have Britain crash out of the E.U. on Oct. 31.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fVIMqVCRrgLcm1ESh-GtBk3FNWA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MGBXX3HVUQI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
