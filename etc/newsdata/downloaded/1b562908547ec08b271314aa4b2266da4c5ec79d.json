Ticket holders, most of whom paid $200,000 or more for a Virgin Galactic flight, will one day congregate at the spaceport before they board a supersonic plane for a 90-minute ride into the upper atmosphere.\n\nThe renovations are another sign that Virgin Galactic is preparing to open for business at Spaceport America, a controversial facility that was built a decade ago using local taxpayer dollars.\n\nImages of the first-floor lounge area show a large coffee bar made of \"back-lit Italian marble hovering above hand-crafted oak,\" according to a press release. Modern couches line the floor-to-ceiling windows at the spaceport with panoramic views of the surrounding desert. Other new facilities include a mission control center, a working area for pilots, and a briefing center.\n\nHundreds of people are lined up to ride a short high-speed trip aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane. Branson, who founded the venture in 2004, plans to be the first tourist aboard a Virgin Galactic space plane. The company said it has additional test flights planned and will be ready to start flying paying customers in the first half of 2020.\n\nVirgin Galactic named the downstairs lounge area \"Gaia,\" the Greek word for Earth.\n\nRead More", "description": "Richard Branson's space tourism startup, Virgin Galactic, is showing off a luxurious lounge area and top-shelf amenities for its wealthy clientele.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190815111020-01-virgin-galactic-airport-for-space-tourism---interior-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-15"}
