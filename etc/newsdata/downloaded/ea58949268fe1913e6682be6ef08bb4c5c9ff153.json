Here's What's Going On With Them", "language": "en", "text": "As the Trump administration pulls American troops away from Syria\u2019s northern border, the President has repeatedly insisted that the region\u2019s oil has been \u201csecured,\u201d even going so far as to suggest the United States is now responsible for the fate of the oil.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area where they have the oil,\u201d Trump said during an Oct. 23 press conference. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to be protecting it, and we\u2019ll be deciding what we\u2019re going to do with it in the future.\u201d\n\nIndeed, further complicating an already confusing shift in Washington\u2019s Syria strategy, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Thursday that an unspecified number of American troops and materiel are being sent to defend oil fields in eastern Syria held by Kurdish forces. They were key U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS, but the American withdrawal opened the door for Turkey, which views the main Kurdish militia in Syria as a threat, to launch an offensive against the group.\n\nFrom the Kurdish forces to the Syrian government, the oil fields are vital to actors within Syria, experts say. What\u2019s less clear, however, is whether Trump or the U.S. more broadly can determine what happens to the oil, as the President suggested he has the power to do. Moreover, experts say Trump\u2019s focus on the topic fits into a broader pattern of fixating on Middle Eastern oil, which he has often suggested \u201ctaking\u201d as compensation for U.S. military activity in the region.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about Syria\u2019s oil fields, and why President Trump keeps mentioning them.\n\nWhy are Syria\u2019s oil fields important?\n\nBefore the Syrian civil war began in 2011, Syria produced about 385,000 barrels of oil per day, says Jeff Colgan, a political science professor at Brown University and author of Petro-Aggression: When Oil Causes War. The majority of that oil came from the fields in the country\u2019s northeast.\n\nAs Syria descended into bloodshed, The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, took advantage of the chaos and began to grow in military strength and in territory. Eventually, it took over oil fields, the proceeds from which helped fund the group\u2019s sprawling operations.\n\nTargeting the oil fields helped the U.S. and its allies strip ISIS of its territory. \u201cA big part of the strategy of defeating ISIS was actually to try to disrupt the oil supply chain, to take out tankers carrying oil, or to destroy any kind of refineries, any sort of ISIS oil operations,\u201d says Colgan. ISIS lost control of the oil fields in 2017 amid fighting with the Kurdish-lead, American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. \u201cThe net result was Kurdish forces and U.S. forces helped occupy the territory where the oil fields are,\u201d says Colgan.\n\nLate in the fighting, ISIS forces destroyed much of the oil infrastructure. But Kurdish forces have since been able to repair some of the damage, says Dareen Khalifa, the senior Syria analyst for International Crisis Group, another think tank. Revenue from the fields has helped support the Kurdish forces in the area, who use the money to pay fighters and civil servants.\n\nWhy is the U.S. keeping troops in Syria to defend the oil fields?\n\nAfter the White House\u2019s Oct. 6 announcement that American troops were being withdrawn from Syria\u2019s border with Turkey ahead of a planned Turkish offensive against Kurdish forces, critics on both sides of the aisle accused Trump of abandoning Washington\u2019s Kurdish allies. In a statement, the SDF called the U.S. withdrawal a \u201cstab in the back;\u201d locals reportedly pelted American vehicles with rotten fruit and potatoes as they left. Others say the move destabilized the region more broadly, in part by triggering a humanitarian crisis that has displaced hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nTrump has repeatedly defended the decision to leave the Syrian border, saying the Kurdish forces are \u201cno angels,\u201d arguing that \u201cit\u2019s not our border,\u201d and describing the conflict as \u201clike two kids in a lot, you\u2019ve got to let them fight, and then you pull them apart.\u201d The President caused further confusion Thursday when he tweeted that \u201cperhaps it is time for the Kurds to start heading to the Oil Region;\u201d what he meant by that was unclear. Meanwhile, Turkey\u2019s offensive against Kurdish forces continues despite an American-crafted ceasefire. And Russia, Washington\u2019s longtime geopolitical foe, has sent troops to the region, in part filling the power vacuum left by the American absence.", "description": "Syria's oil fields once served as the economic engine powering ISIS", "authors": ["Madeleine Carlisle"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_QaF7RkxEjUM2pxuMZRuNw--~B/aD02NjM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/997050cb61a421e56093c5e4e6f56807", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
