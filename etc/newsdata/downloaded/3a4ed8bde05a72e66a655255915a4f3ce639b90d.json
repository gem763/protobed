Mr Trump told the United Nations on September 24 that \u201cthe future belongs to patriots, not globalists\u201d. Everyone assumed our Prime Minister had sipped the same Kool-Aid during dinner on the White House lawn a few days earlier. \u201cGlobalism must facilitate, align, and engage, rather than direct and centralise\u201d, he said in his Lowy speech. \u201cSuch an approach can corrode support for joint international action. Only a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia\u201d.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, meanwhile, has been busy demanding the redesigning of national energy industries by next year, declaring fossil-fuel industries dead, and wants the West to hand over $100 billion a year to developing countries to mitigate climate change.\n\nHow does that even work?\n\nLiberal Party suspicion of an overreaching UN owes far more to Robert Menzies than Mr Trump. And much of what Mr Morrison said is long-standing common sense. The nation state remains the basic decision-making unit for the world\u2019s citizens that are lucky enough to live in a democracy. Self-important global bureaucrats cannot generate consent from the governed, essential if anything is to get done, no matter how much they would like to. Mr Morrison\u2019s formulation that global bodies should coordinate rather than direct is a good one. That is not Trumpian populism speaking over the global good.\n\nPutting policy through the filter of national self-interest is more likely to produce action. European activists have managed to push global warming to the top of the UN\u2019s calendar, at the expense of low-income countries that are more interested in poverty reduction and living standards. More would happen if noisy climate change agitation was balanced against those objectives too.\n\nAll nations pool their sovereignty to get things done collectively. That can be extreme in some instances. Britain for example is a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Its core Article 5 says that if a fellow member is attacked, then the UK is automatically is at war too, the most drastic action a sovereign nation can take. Yet the pooling of Britain\u2019s peacetime sovereignty in the European Union clearly went a step too far, rightly or wrongly, for a majority of British voters. What should have remained essentially a giant free trade area now revolves around its shared 19-nation currency. But the euro is now forcing the EU into ever-greater political integration to try and fix the currency\u2019s perpetual crisis. Those pressures could yet set Europeans against each other and put the whole EU project, with all the good that it has done, in jeopardy.", "description": "Putting action through the filter of national self-interest is more likely to get things done.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.672%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1070%2C$y_150/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d7dc98264b40a4a7129fc16d88416bbca05b423b", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
