Is it safe?", "language": "en", "text": "But we\u2019ve recently reviewed the research and found vigorous exercise is safe during pregnancy, including in the third trimester. Not only is it safe; it\u2019s healthy, too.\n\nModerate or vigorous?\n\nThe safety of moderate intensity exercise during pregnancy has been well-established. Walking, swimming and using an exercise bike are all activities that could be considered moderate intensity.\n\nAD\n\nExpectant mothers who do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week, as recommended by the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines, are healthier, happier, stronger and develop fewer complications like gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.\n\nAD\n\nWhen we\u2019re talking about vigorous exercise, this means exercising to an intensity where you struggle to maintain a conversation, but can still manage a sentence. This could include activities such as jogging, circuit-based resistance training, or interval training on a stationary bike.\n\nIn the broader population, it\u2019s exercise at 70 percent to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate (where maximum heart rate is about 220 beats per minute minus your age).\n\nAD\n\nFor pregnant women, it may feel a little harder to achieve vigorous intensity exercise because of some normal changes to the heart and blood that occur during pregnancy.\n\nAnd the safety of doing vigorous exercise during pregnancy has been more controversial. For example, past research has suggested that during vigorous exercise, blood flow is redirected to the muscles and could take away oxygen and nutrients from the growing baby.\n\nAD\n\nOur research\n\nWe collated all studies looking at mothers exercising at a vigorous intensity during the third trimester, to understand how safe this was for mothers and babies. Our review included 15 studies totaling 32,703 pregnant women.\n\nAD\n\nWhat we found should be reassuring for active women with healthy pregnancies: Vigorous exercise appears to be safe for both mom and baby, even into the third trimester.\n\nThe studies looked at a range of outcomes for both mother and baby, and none showed any meaningful increase in risk. There was no difference in birth weight of babies when their moms did vigorous exercise; and in particular no difference in the number of babies born small for gestational age.\n\nFor women in the healthy-weight range, vigorous exercise didn\u2019t affect the amount of weight they gained during pregnancy. That is, they followed the expected trajectory of weight gain as their pregnancy progressed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut, in overweight and obese women, for whom it can be more difficult to adhere to the recommended weight gain during pregnancy, vigorous exercise did appear to reduce maternal weight gain.\n\nIt was also associated with a slightly lower chance of a baby being born premature, and a few extra days of gestation.\n\nHigh-intensity and high-impact exercise\n\nExercise at greater than 90 percent of maximum heart rate is considered \u201chigh-intensity exercise.\u201d This is where you can\u2019t even string a sentence together.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know if high-intensity training carries any risks, so there\u2019s still a limit to what expectant mothers might want to do later in a pregnancy. We\u2019d recommended they do the \u201ctalk test\u201d to make sure they can still speak while exercising.\n\nAD\n\nExpectant mothers should also be cautious about doing \u00adhigh-impact exercise in the third trimester, like running, jumping or lifting heavy weights. The findings from our review suggest these types of high-impact activities are not likely to affect the baby, but it\u2019s still not known whether they may weaken the mother\u2019s pelvic floor muscles, which may contribute to incontinence.\n\nAD\n\nIf expectant mothers want to keep these activities up, we\u2019d recommend they consult an exercise professional and their doctor.\n\nAny exercise is good\n\nVigorous exercise is an efficient strategy for improving a mother\u2019s physical and mental health. The benefits to her heart, lungs, muscles and mood are likely to be the same, if not greater, than for moderate exercise.\n\nAD\n\nThe main aim of physical activity in pregnancy is to achieve health-enhancing benefits in a way that is safe, enjoyable and sustainable.\n\nSome women may find it difficult to be mobile in the third trimester, let alone exercise vigorously. So, if you\u2019re happily doing lighter exercise, like regular walks, you can feel confident in the benefits you\u2019re providing both you and your baby.\n\nPregnancy specific yoga or Pilates may also be a gentler way to improve muscular strength, heart health and mental health. These activities might help you prepare your body for the upcoming challenge of childbirth and subsequent recovery.\n\nAD\n\nIf you\u2019re struggling to achieve the recommended 150 minutes per week, particularly in the third trimester, then find ways to increase your breathing rate in shorter bouts. For example, by taking the stairs, parking the car a little farther away or going for a brisk walk on your lunch break.\n\nAD\n\nMothers will usually get the most benefit with some extra support, whether from an exercise professional (like an accredited exercise physiologist), medical practitioner or both. Programs can be tailored to the most suitable exercise intensity for you.\n\nKassia Beetham is a lecturer in exercise physiology at Australian Catholic University in Brisbane.
