Sign up here.\n\nMitt Romney admitted with a coy \u201cc\u2019est moi\u201d that he'd been tweeting under the moniker \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d since 2011.\n\nDelecto barely posts, but when he does, he acts exactly the way you'd expect from the Utah senator. He once went after President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull troops out of Syria, liked tweets critical of the president, and made broad statements about principle over party politics.\n\nRomney let it slip that he had an online alter ego to the Atlantic\u2019s McKay Coppins Sunday, but he didn\u2019t reveal the handle. Almost immediately, known Twitter sleuth and journalist Ashley Feinberg took up the case and soon found him: @qaws9876. (She had experience unearthing former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s secret Twitter, after all.)\n\nRomney later confirmed to Coppins that the account was, in fact, his brainchild. But the moniker he chose may not be quite as erudite as the one Comey chose for himself, Reinhold Niebuhr, the theologian that Comey wrote his college thesis about.\n\nShortly after \u201cDelecto\u201d was outed, he set his account to private, then to public again for a few minutes, before finally going private for good (at least as of press time). But from what we know, the account posted in a voice that sounds, well, distinctly like Mitt. He even tweeted about himself once, to clarify to CNN\u2019s Soledad O\u2019Brien that he was, in fact, the \u201conly Republican to hit Trump on the Mueller report, only one to hit Trump on character time and time again.\u201d\n\nRomney told Coppins that he follows 688 people, including \u201cWhat\u2019s his name, the big redhead from Boston?\u201d (He meant Conan O\u2019Brien.) By the time Feinberg found his account, Delecto had followed 702 people and had just eight followers. And the rest of his followers make perfect sense for Romney \u2014 a smattering of political journalists, commentators, politicians, and several members of the Romney family.\n\nBill Kristol, the late John McCain, and Peggy Noonan also made the cut, as did reporters on the Romney beat when the account was created back in 2011, as \u201cDelecto\u201d \u2014 erm, Romney \u2014 was launching his presidential bid. The account also follows Brett Favre.\n\nDelecto doesn\u2019t follow President Trump. Romney said he tweets too much, and compared his account to one of his nieces, who posts too much on Instagram. \u201cI love her, but it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much,\u201d Romney told Coppins.\n\nTurns out that Feinberg found Delecto\u2019s account through Romney\u2019s granddaughter, Allie. She has a manageable number of followers on Twitter, and the Delecto account seemed to be one of the few that followed her and appeared to be actively working to conceal the identity of the person behind it.\n\nThe internet, of course, loved the nickname.\n\nTrump, too, used a fake name, for the sake of self-promotion, back in the 1980s. When he pretended to be his own publisher, Trump went by \u201cJohn Barron.\u201d\n\n\n\nCover image: Sen.
