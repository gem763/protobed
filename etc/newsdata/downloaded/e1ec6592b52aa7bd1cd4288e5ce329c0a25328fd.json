But \"Julia\" was the first prime-time network series to star a black woman playing a professional character, as opposed to a maid or domestic worker, as was the case in the 1950s sitcom \"Beulah.\"\n\n\"She never wanted to praise herself for anything in that regard,\" Panella said. \"It was more that she felt that she was a part of the expansion of the African-American community in the arts, not the sole creator of that movement.\"\n\nCarroll's close friend and fellow vocalist from that era, Dionne Warwick, reacted with grief, saying, \"My personal world has taken a downward spiral. Losing my dear friend and mentor comes as a true hurt to my heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nANOTHER SINGLE-MOM ROLE\n\nCarroll's success as \"Julia\" set her up for another title role in the 1974 movie, \"Claudine,\" for which she received an Academy Award nomination as best actress. Playing opposite James Earl Jones, she reprised her single-mother persona, this time living in Harlem with six children and on public relief.\n\nShe went on to play numerous screen roles, mostly in television shows and made-for-TV movies, until just a few years ago. Besides \"Julia,\" she is perhaps best remembered by TV audiences for her role as Dominique Deveraux, a glamorous diva on the 1980s hit prime-time soap opera \"Dynasty.\"\n\nCarol Diann Johnson was born in the Bronx borough of New York City on July 17, 1935, daughter of a subway conductor, and began singing with her Harlem church choir at age 6, according to IMDB.com.\n\nModeling for Ebony magazine by the time she was 15, she adopted the more exotic-sounding Diahann Carroll as a teenager auditioning for singing gigs, it said.\n\nIn 1954, she landed her first singing role on Broadway in the musical \"House of Flowers,\" before going on to play Clara in the Otto Preminger's big-screen version of \"Porgy and Bess in 1959. She also had auditioned for the lead in Preminger's 1954 film adaptation of \"Carmen Jones\" but ended up cast in the supporting role of Myrt instead.\n\nHer performance as a fashion model in the 1962 Broadway musical interracial love story \"No Strings\" won her a Tony Award as best actress, a first for an African-American performer.\n\nCarroll, who had been married four times, also sang in nightclubs and recorded several record albums from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s.\n\n\"She was a tremendous talent and just a very unique human being,\" said Panella. \"I was blessed to have her as my client for all of that time.\u201d (Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty, David Gregorio and Daniel Wallis)", "description": "Diahann Carroll, a versatile singer and stage actress who quietly blazed a trail for black women on American television in the late 1960s by playing a widowed nurse and single mother in \"Julia,\" died on Friday at age 84, her manager said.
