In the show, the mask-wearing enigma is second-in-command to the leader of the sect, Alpha (Samantha Morton).\n\nHurst revealed to companion show The Talking Dead, however, that his character\u2019s true face could be easily recognisable to viewers.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t say too much,\u2019 the actor reveals. \u2018All I can say at this point is maybe Beta was a large personality in the world before the apocalypse, and that sort of letting go of that might have been tragic to his psyche. I can\u2019t say much more than that.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Sons of Anarchy star had previously joked to Entertainment Weekly that Beta\u2019s true face was a \u2018bleary resemblance to Whoopi Goldberg,\u2019 so we could be in for a real shock if and when his true face is revealed in season 10.\n\nAs ever, though, The Walking Dead comic book itself did reveal who was behind the mask \u2013 a famous basketball player whom the survivors recognise from car commercials.\n\nBeta\u2019s relationship with Whisperer leader Alpha could be tested in the new season (Picture: AMC)\n\nAt this point, however, the show has digressed from the comics on so many pivotal moments we don\u2019t know for sure if this will happen on-screen, or whether the producers have surprise casting announcement under their sleeve.\n\nIn other zombie apocalypse based news, we\u2019re still reeling from the introduction of Gemma (Thora Birch) in the newest episode of the show.\n\nAnd could Carol and Daryl actually leave The Walking Dead together in a blaze of glory? Say it isn\u2019t so!\n\nThe Walking Dead season 10 continues Sunday in the US, with episodes releasing Mondays on Fox in the UK.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
