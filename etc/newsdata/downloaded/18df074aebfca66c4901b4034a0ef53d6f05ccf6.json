The world record is 90,185 set at the Women\u2019s World Cup Final between the USA and China in Pasadena in 1999.\n\n\"This is a dream come true,\u201d said former England captain Casey Stoney who has over 130 caps for England and is now managing Manchester United. \u201cI played for Chelsea first team aged 12 so I\u2019ve been involved in the game at the top level for 25 years and I didn\u2019t ever, ever see the day. What an occasion. Let\u2019s hope the performance matches the occasion and that everyone wants to come back.\u201d\n\nThe FA are hopeful that everyone who bought a ticket will turn up and there will not be a repeat of Chelsea\u2019s game at Stamford Bridge earlier this season where they gave out 40,000 free tickets but just under 25,000 attended on the day.", "description": "The England women's football team are set to break the women's all time attendance record with next month's friendly against Germany at the 90,000 capacity Wembley Stadium now sold out.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213221290-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcCUlY4ecowelYv5R9cM4VwiWPPJj3RTaXWF1UIDDREk.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
