It\u2019s something else,\u201d the director said Sunday at a BFI London Film Festival press conference for his new film The Irishman, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be invaded by it. We need cinemas to step up and show films that are narrative films.\u201d\n\nHis most recent critique follows other comments made Saturday, when Scorsese took part in the BAFTA\u2019s David Lean Lecture, also in London. \u201cTheaters have become amusement parks. That is all fine and good but don\u2019t invade everything else in that sense,\u201d the director said. \u201cThat is fine and good for those who enjoy that type of film and, by the way, knowing what goes into them now, I admire what they do. It\u2019s not my kind of thing, it simply is not. It\u2019s creating another kind of audience that thinks cinema is that.\u201d Hey, at least he admires how much work goes into making all these terrible \u201ctheme park\u201d movies? That\u2019s something, right?", "description": "Martin Scorsese continues to publicly critique \u201ctheme park\u201d movies, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying cinema needs to step up.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/13-Martin-Scorsese.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
