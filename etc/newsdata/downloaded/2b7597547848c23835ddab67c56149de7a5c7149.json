The law only applies to certain animals \u2013 deer, elk, pronghorn antelopes or wild pigs \u2013 and the perpetrator must apply for a \u201cwildlife salvage permit\u201d within 24 hours in order to legally move the animal.\n\nCalifornia is the 29th US state to enact such a law; many US states have been happily serving up roadkill for years. In West Virginia, there is even an annual roadkill festival, where local chefs compete with their best roadkill recipes.\n\nWe spoke to an expert to answer all the burning questions people may have about roadkill as a dinner entr\u00e9e.\n\nIs it safe to eat?\n\nThis depends on a few things, according to chef Doug Paine, who ran a popular roadkill supper club in Vermont. His first tip is to avoid already dead animals. \u201cDon\u2019t drive up to dead animals and pick them up,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIf the animal is injured or dying at least you know how long it has been there.\u201d\n\n(Anyone who finds an animal should notify officials first, to make sure of what the regulations are in your area around harvesting roadkill, or to see if it can be saved.)\n\nIf it is safe and legal for you to eat, you will need to cook it within 12 hours so it doesn\u2019t begin to spoil.\n\nPaine says that anyone with a basic understanding of food safety can prepare roadkill fairly simply. His definition, however, includes gutting, dressing and hanging the roadkill, so don\u2019t attempt it without some basic butchery skills.\n\nIf you are unsure, take it to a butcher: \u201cMost butchers are familiar with wild game, but you can also scout around online for speciality meat processors if you\u2019re nervous about that,\u201d he says.\n\nWhat are the best animals to eat?\n\nThere are many good things you can eat off the side of the road \u2013 and much of it is better quality than what you would get in the store.\n\n\u201cAny wild venison or moose meat is far superior in flavor to commercially grown meats because they have a naturally organic diet,\u201d explains Paine. In the US particularly, mass-produced meat is fairly mild because people are put off by stronger flavors like grass-fed beef or mutton, he adds.\n\nRoadkill, on the other hand, is pretty much the most organic you can get \u2013 the animal hasn\u2019t been reared in poor conditions or factory farmed, and it has survived on an organic diet, resulting in a rich and complex flavor, according to Paine.\n\n\n\nThe best thing he\u2019s eaten? \u201cFor us the most surprising was black bear. It\u2019s really quite tasty, like a darker pork with a little more red meat. We made some nice sausage out of it,\u201d says Paine. (You\u2019re perhaps best advised not to go out looking for that one.)\n\nIs there anything you can\u2019t eat?\n\nThere don\u2019t seem to be any clear guidelines about animals that you can\u2019t eat, although many people are against eating household pets such as cats or dogs.\n\nPaine does, however, know of a specific animal which is not that tasty: \u201cWe tried muskrat once, and it wasn\u2019t particularly great. It had a flavor like a cross between turkey and tuna fish. It was very strange,\u201d he says.\n\nIs it ethical to eat roadkill?\n\nStudies suggest the most environmentally friendly diet is a vegan one, but for those hell-bent on eating meat, roadkill could be a more ethically conscious alternative.\n\nThe animal rights campaign group Peta supports eating roadkill over eating meat prepared in slaughterhouses.\n\n\u201cPeta has no ethical objection to laws that allow the collection of an animal\u2019s remains discovered on the side of the road. While the best thing for animals, the environment, and human health is to go vegan, roadkill is certainly a superior option to the neatly shrink-wrapped packages of meat in the supermarket, which contain the corpses of animals who spent their lives on a filthy feedlot and were crammed on to a transport truck \u2013 and whose throats were slit in a terrifying slaughterhouse,\u201d a Peta representative said.\n\nWhere can I cook or eat roadkill?\n\nThere are 29 states (now including California) where you can eat roadkill, and some even have roadkill eating attractions.\n\nBut you should approach with caution: the laws around harvesting roadkill differ by state. For example, in some there is a legal requirement to have a permit or to submit your roadkill for inspection first; in others there are certain animals you can\u2019t eat depending on the time of the year. Always check the official guidance in your state first.\n\nWhat\u2019s a great roadkill recipe?\n\nPaine\u2019s easy recipe for bear chilli is laid out below, although we\u2019re betting you can use a substitute if you don\u2019t happen to stumble upon any wild bear.\n\nIngredients\n\nGround bear meat 1lb\n\nChopped bacon \u00bclb\n\n1/2 a chopped onion\n\n1 chopped red bell pepper\n\n1 chopped fresh tomato\n\nLime juice 1/4 cup\n\nChopped cilantro 2 tablespoons\n\nChopped garlic 1 tablespoon\n\nCocoa powder 1 tablespoon\n\nDried chilli or chilli powder 2 tablespoons\n\nMaple syrup 1/4 cup\n\nRed wine 1 cup\n\nSalt 1 \u00bd teaspoons\n\nTomato juice 1 cup\n\n1 cinnamon stick\n\nMethod", "description": "Some chefs and activists say animals killed on the road are the most organic and most ethical to eat \u2013 and bear meat is great in chilli", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b6a4fa92f91dbabba2c57d767de9e0ba5fedde/801_1494_2510_1506/master/2510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b42bc9dc1232a5e8a69bf307e2e0790f", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
