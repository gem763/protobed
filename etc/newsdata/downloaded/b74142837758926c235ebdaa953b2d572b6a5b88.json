Barr caught care in the least about the law, Congress or our institutions. Barr is literally wearing a police uniform as he commits his crimes and obstructs justice, and he has a long history of misrepresenting reports, documents and opinions, including his own opinions. William Barr lied to the American people and Congress by completely misrepresenting the findings in the Muller Report over Muller\u2019s objections and Barr tried to cover up the whistleblower complaint. Back in 1992, the last time Bill Barr was U.S. attorney general, New York Times writer William Safire referred to him as \u201cCoverup-General Barr\u201d because of his role in burying evidence of then-President George H.W. Bush\u2019s involvement in \u201cIraqgate\u201d and \u201cIran-Contra.\u201d Remember, John Mitchell, Nixon\u2019s AG, ended up going to jail for everything that Bagdad Barr is doing now - conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and sooner or later perjury. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Barr to the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General. He wrote a complete advisory opinion justifying the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel Noriega for the DOJ. Barr then declined a congressional request for the full opinion, but instead provided a document that \"summarizes the principal conclusions.\" Congress subpoenaed the opinion, and its public release after Barr's departure from the Justice Department showed he had omitted significant findings in the opinion from his summary document. Barr\u2019s summary to Congress was the opposite of his own complete advisory opinion, which is exactly what he did with the Muller Report.", "description": "Former Rep.
