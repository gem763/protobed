She is reported to have made a large sum from the deal.\n\nThe allegations, which first surfaced in 2017, forced Mr Ferrand to resign as a government minister in Mr Macron's cabinet.\n\nCharges of alleged misconduct were later shelved, however, after a court in Brittany ruled that there was no basis for prosecution, allowing Mr Ferrand to return to politics.\n\nBut on Thursday, prosecutors announced that they were proceeding with the case and charged Mr Ferrand with conflict of interest.\n\nFollowing the news, Mr Ferrand said in a statement that he would remain in his assembly post during the investigation, and that \"no new element\" had been produced in what he described as a case in which \"there is neither harm nor victim\".\n\nPresident Macron later said that Mr Ferrand still had \"all my confidence\".\n\nThe French president's popularity has been volatile since he took office in 2017.\n\nMr Macron has been forced to abandon policy plans in the face of violent street protests by the \"gilets jaunes\" (France's yellow-vest movement) and has become a target for nationalist politicians across Europe.", "description": "Richard Ferrand, a member of the French president's 2017 campaign team, faces corruption allegations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14BB4/production/_108761948_gettyimages-980379996-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
