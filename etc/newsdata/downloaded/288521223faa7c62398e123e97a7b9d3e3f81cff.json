This year a stunning fluorescent view of a turtle embryo won first place.\n\nMicroscopy technician Teresa Zgoda and recent university graduate Teresa Kugler captured the image using fluorescence and stereo microscopy.\n\nThe winning pair stacked and stitched together hundreds of images to create the final image of their turtle.\n\n\u201cMicroscopy lets us zoom in on the smallest organisms and building blocks that comprise our world\u2013giving us a profound appreciation for the small things in life that far too often go unnoticed,\u201d said Kugler. \u201cIt allows me to do science with a purpose.\u201d", "description": "Count the eyes of a spider, investigate the inner workings of an alligator embryo and see more of the world under a microscope.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_43/3059941/ss6-javier-ruperez-hairy-spider_846a53ccde8e5d09f6b911f08a142bf4.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
