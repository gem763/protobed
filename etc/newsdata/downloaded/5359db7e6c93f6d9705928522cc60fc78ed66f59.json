The federal agency named 362 schools as 2019 National Blue Ribbon Schools last week.\n\n\u201cAs a National Blue Ribbon School, your students\u2019 success demonstrates what\u2019s possible when committed educators partner with parents and community leaders to create vibrant, challenging cultures of learning,\u201d Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said in a video message to the schools.\n\nAlice Deal Middle and Ross Elementary in Northwest D.C. are the schools in the traditional public school system to receive the honor in recognition of high performance on standardized tests.\n\nKIPP DC Heights Academy, an elementary charter school in the Anacostia neighborhood, received the honor for its work in closing the achievement gap.\n\nAlice Deal and Ross students tend to come from wealthier families than the average D.C. student. But the schools are also among the city\u2019s more diverse, with large populations of white, black and Hispanic students.\n\nThe city nominates campuses for the award, and school leaders fill out a lengthy application.\n\n\u201cWe focused on our belief that all children can meet or achieve grade-level standards,\u201d said Holly Searl, principal of Ross, where nearly 20 percent of students do not speak English as their first language.\n\nAt Heights Academy, the student body is nearly entirely black, with 62 percent of students considered at-risk.\n\n\u201cThe students show up each day ready to embrace the joys and challenges that come with learning, and their staff commits each day to ensuring they feel valued, heard, and empowered to be successful,\u201d Gaelan Gallagher, principal of Heights Academy in 2018-2019, said in a statement.\n\nBlessed Sacrament Elementary in D.C.\u2019s Chevy Chase neighborhood and St. Peter School on Capitol Hill are the private campuses designated Blue Ribbon Schools for their performance.\n\nIn suburban Maryland, Glenarden Woods Elementary in Prince George\u2019s County, St. Raphael School in Rockville and St. Joseph\u2019s Regional Catholic School in Beltsville received the distinction.\n\nIn the Virginia suburbs, Arlington Traditional School, Rodney E. Thompson Middle in Stafford, Trinity Christian School in Fairfax and St. Francis of Assisi School in Prince William County earned the honor.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Three public schools and two private schools received the annual honor.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
