The jerseys were made as a special fundraising effort to raise money for girls youth sports in the community, the paper reported.\n\nHowever, their celebration in the eventual 1-1 draw came at a small price.\n\nThe four players who removed their jerseys were all shown yellow cards for unsportsmanlike conduct, according to the paper. Taking off one\u2019s jersey is reportedly against the league\u2019s bylaws.\n\nThe team had received full support from the school and coaching staff when they first came up with the idea to promote equal pay several weeks ago, their coach Jeff Hayes told ABC News\u2019 \"Good Morning America\" on Sunday.\n\nHe said their statement was inspired by the World Cup-winning U.S. Women's team. U.S. captain and FIFA player of the year Megan Rapinoe has been vocal in the fight for equal pay. The U.S. Women\u2019s team sued the U.S. Soccer Federation in March for gender and pay discrimination.\n\nUS WOMEN COUNTER SOCCER FEDERATION'S ASSERTIONS ON PAY\n\nThe prize money for the Women\u2019s 2019 World Cup totaled just $30 million compared to the Men\u2019s $400 million total from Russia last year.\n\n\"It goes for everyone \u2013 every girl, every woman, the world,\" player Helen Worden told GMA. \"It\u2019s not just about sports.\u201d\n\nThe girls\u2019 actions have attracted attention outside their community, including a tweet of admiration from former Women\u2019s star Brandi Chastain, who famously ripped her jersey off revealing her sports bra after scoring the winning penalty during the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup final against China.\n\nVermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy and his wife, Marcelle, also tweeted their support of the team\u2019s initiative, wearing the custom jerseys in a photo with the message: \u201cMarcelle and I stand with you!\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nOver 700 of the Nike jerseys have been sold so far. Even the ref who issued the yellow cards bought a one after the game, the team told GMA.\n\nThe jerseys cost $25, but men and boys were invited to pay 16 percent more to represent the average pay gap in Vermont, according to a website promoting the Free Press.", "description": "A high school girls soccer team in Vermont has gained national attention after their statement for equal pay during a game last week resulted in several yellow cards.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Burlington-High-School-Girls-Soccer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
