Raising the state pension age, forcing pensioners to pay national insurance contributions, the sale of the NHS to a foreign country, and insulting the previously untouchable royal family (I\u2019m looking at you, Nigel Farage) have become common currency.\n\nAdd to that the recent events where we have what appears to be a serial misleader as a PM. Boris Johnson is less than two months into the job \u2013 and heading for the Supreme Court on an accusation of yet more misleading statements, this time to Her Majesty.\n\nThat court \u2013 whose quality and independence was accepted by everyone \u2013 will now probably be attacked by friends of said PM.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

It cannot be stressed enough that progressive parties need to work together.\n\nNigel Farage has offered to form an electoral pact with the pro-Brexit Conservatives, which they have rejected. But if this were to happen, it would change the arithmetic of politics for the worse and would result in a real advantage for the Brexit Party in a forthcoming general election. In order to counter this eventuality, progressive parties \u2013 Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP, Plaid, TIG \u2013 must work together and hopefully form electoral pacts in order to neutralise any advantage that a Tory/Brexit Party pact would have. Otherwise it is entirely possible that it could lead to a Tory/Brexit landslide under our first-past-the-post electoral system.\n\nThis past week has shown how much more effective cooperation is over divisive party politics. This proposal may be opposed by some party members, but if it were to be organised in a fair and proportionate manner for a strict time limit, it would give the progressive opposition parties an equal playing field, thereby insuring a more balanced outcome in a general election. It would also go a long way to stopping Britain being dragged closer to being a low-tax, Singapore-type economy with poor environment and employment standards.\n\nJustin Beament\n\nCrediton\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Richard Morgan/The Independent\n\nOperation Yellowhammer\n\nI wonder if the choice of the name \u201cYellowhammer\u201d for the scenario after a no-deal Brexit was down to the fact that the song of the bird of the same name has a rhythm which sounds like \u201ca little bit of bread and no cheese\u201d. Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings... and little yellow birds!\n\nColin Burke\n\nCumbria\n\nWhy didn\u2019t we see this before?\n\nI have not yet heard anyone in the media ask why the consequences of a no-deal Brexit were not sought and made available to voters before the referendum. The fact that this didn\u2019t happen with such a momentous issue points unequivocally to gerrymandering by the government, and complicity by some parts of the media who don\u2019t question this obvious evidence for it.\n\nAndrew Mclauchlin\n\nStratford-upon-Avon\n\nRecycling the old way\n\nPhoebe Weston highlights how complex seemingly straightforward solutions to recycling can be (MPs call for tax on all single-use plastic packaging, 12 September). As she points out, many \u201csolutions\u201d can be shown to have an environmental cost when looked at in depth. Reuse seems to be the most viable option available, and it is gratifying to read that some retailers are seriously investigating this option.\n\nIt should be remembered that until fairly recently \u2013 the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 a deposit was payable on soft drink and beer bottles, to be redeemed on return to the retailer. Even if the purchaser was disinclined to go to the trouble of returning the bottles, youngsters were more than happy to augment their meagre pocket money by taking the empties back. Of course, we live in a different world now where, unless the deposit was significant, say \u00a31 per bottle, youngsters would probably be unwilling to go to the trouble.\n\nHowever, the general public is becoming more aware of the environmental costs, and public pressure, rather than financial inducements, will hopefully be an effective deterrent to the unacceptable pollution of our planet.\n\nPatrick Cleary\n\nGloucestershire", "description": "Brexit has turned us into an utterly divided country.
