Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like the worst-kept secret that\u2019s out there right now why Jimmy missed the game. Jimmy is now a proud father, and he has a baby daughter,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThe rest I\u2019ll let him give you the details. Everything has obviously been unbelievable news in the last 24 hours. We\u2019re thrilled for him and really excited to add his daughter to our Heat family.\u201d\n\nThe Heat beat the Memphis Grizzlies 120-101 on Thursday and are heading north to meet the Milwaukee Bucks on Saturday and the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. He is not expected to travel with the team and play in either game. The Heat acquired Butler in an offseason trade with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nIn 65 games last season between Minnesota and Philadelphia, Butler averaged 18.7 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers have reached a four-year deal worth $30.8 million with starting small forward Cedi Osman, according to multiple reports.\n\nOsman, 24, was acquired by the Cavaliers in a draft-night deal in 2015 and joined the team prior to the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe new contract will pay Osman $8.75 million next season, then drop by $700,000 each season after. The final year is not guaranteed, giving the Cavaliers flexibility down the road. In 76 games last season (75 starts), Osman averaged 13.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 32.2 minutes per game. He had 13 points and three rebounds in a season-opening loss to the Orlando Magic on Wednesday.\n\nGuard Jordan McRae will have surgery to repair a fractured right ring finger, the Washington Wizards announced.\n\nMcRae, 28, suffered the injury in the tip of his finger in a 108-100 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. The team says he\u2019ll be re-evaluated early next week.\n\nMcRae had 11 points, five rebounds and three assists in 23 minutes off the bench in the season-opening loss. In 87 career games (five starts) since 2015, McRae has averaged 5.0 points and 1.2 rebounds in 10.7 minutes per game.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Jimmy Butler missed his regular-season debut with the Miami Heat for unspecified \"personal reasons,\" but coach Erik Spoelstra cleared up the mystery Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445149723&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P06T-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
