REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\n\nOsram, which is larger than AMS and a leader in automotive lighting, said on Wednesday that buyout firms Bain and Advent were prepared to offer \u201cmeaningfully\u201d more than the Austrian firm\u2019s bid, which was then 38.50 euros a share.\n\n\u201cAMS ... has increased the price of its all-cash takeover offer for 100% of the share capital of Osram to 41.00 euros per Osram share. All other terms and conditions of the best and final offer remain unchanged,\u201d AMS said in a statement on Friday.\n\nIt later added that it had gained a significant foothold.\n\n\u201cAMS now holds 14.69% of all Osram shares as a direct shareholding including shares unconditionally bought today but not counting the shares already tendered into the Best and Final Offer,\u201d AMS said. \u201cThis makes AMS the largest shareholder in Osram based on the latest information available.\u201d\n\nBest known for supplying Apple (AAPL.O) with sensors for iPhones, AMS said the offer would still expire on Oct. 1, leaving rivals a short window to offer an alternative.\n\nAMS wants to expand in the auto industry and supply manufacturers with sensors and lighting systems for self-driving cars to reduce its dependence on smartphone producers.\n\nSdK, a group representing small shareholders and itself a holder of Osram shares, said that it would now tender its stock to AMS. It did not say how many Osram shares it owns.\n\n\u201cFrom SdK\u2019s point of view the industrial logic of a tie-up of AMS and Osram is understandable,\u201d SdK said.\n\n\u2018CAREFULLY PLANNED\u2019\n\nAMS has said it would cut Osram jobs outside Germany, sell its digital business and phase out its consumer general lighting LED business.\n\nShares in Osram were up 3.1% at 39.90 euros, valuing the company at around 3.86 billion euros ($4.2 billion), while those in Zurich-listed AMS were down 7.5% at 1010 GMT. Its market capitalization is 3.54 billion Swiss francs ($3.57 billion).\n\n\u201cWe have provided comprehensive commitments aimed at safeguarding employees and production facilities of Osram in Germany and have carefully planned the successful integration of both companies,\u201d AMS said.\n\n\u201cWe offer a superior proposal to all stakeholders, including the Osram employees, given our strategic vision, higher growth, better cash flows and lower cost of capital,\u201d it added.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of German lighting manufacturer Osram is illuminated at the company's headquarters in Munich, Germany, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert\n\nOsram, hit by profit warnings and a weak car market, this month formally backed AMS\u2019s previous offer, which was 10% higher than a bid by Bain Capital and Carlyle Group.\n\nBut reservations within management remained, dominated by doubts about the proposed group\u2019s long-term business prospects.\n\nOsram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien expressed his misgivings at the time by saying he would not sell his shares to AMS.", "description": "Austrian sensor maker AMS raised its takeover offer for Osram to 4.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) on Friday, ratcheting up the pressure on a private equity consortium also vying to buy the German lighting group.", "authors": ["Francois Murphy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434647697&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0QP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
