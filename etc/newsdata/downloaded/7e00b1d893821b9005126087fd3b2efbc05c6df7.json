There is no frontier infrastructure and there are no checks at roughly 270 crossing points used by tens of thousands of vehicles every day.\n\nThis is because Ireland and Britain are both members of the EU and fall under the same \u2018single market\u2019 customs and regulatory arrangements.\n\nBut when Britain leaves, it will become the only land frontier between the EU and Britain, and so logically a \u201chard border\u201d would be needed to ensure that goods entering Ireland from Britain comply with EU standards and do not threaten the bloc\u2019s single market through price dumping or unfair competition.\n\nIf it failed to check goods coming in from Britain, Ireland itself could find the EU raising questions on whether Irish exports to the rest of the Union should remain free of all checks at their ports.\n\nBACKSTOP SOLUTION\n\nTo get around this, a so-called \u201cbackstop\u201d became the keystone of a Withdrawal Agreement that former Prime Minister Theresa May struck with the EU last November.\n\nUnder the backstop mechanism, effectively an insurance policy to keep the border open, Britain would have remained in a customs union with the EU \u201cunless and until\u201d alternative arrangements were found to avoid a hard border.\n\nIreland says an invisible border is a key national interest as any checks or infrastructure on the frontier could undermine Northern Ireland\u2019s 1998 peace deal, known as the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nMore than 3,600 people died in the three-decade conflict between unionists who wanted Northern Ireland to remain British and Irish nationalists who want Northern Ireland to join a united Ireland ruled from Dublin. The open border has helped defuse anger among Irish nationalists about British rule.\n\nHowever, many British lawmakers oppose the prospect of being bound to EU rules and customs duties that would prevent Britain doing its own trade deals and leave it overseen by EU judges.\n\nBoris Johnson, who became British prime minister two months ago, has insisted that to reach a new withdrawal agreement, the backstop would have to be struck out. He has vowed to take Britain out of the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a deal.\n\nALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nJohnson wants \u201calternative arrangements\u201d to be put in place and has urged the other 27 EU member states to be flexible and creative in negotiations to clinch a deal at a Brussels summit on Oct. 17-18.\n\nThe EU\u2019s executive, the European Commission, insists that any new arrangement must deliver on all the core objectives of the backstop. These are: to maintain a fully open border, protect the EU single market and maintain the north-south cooperation made possible by the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThere was talk last month that the Johnson government was considering an initial EU proposal that the backstop would apply only to Northern Ireland, effectively drawing a border in the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and the rest of Britain.\n\nHowever, this option appears to have been abandoned by Johnson, who no longer has a parliamentary majority and may need the support of lawmakers from the DUP, a Northern Ireland unionist party favoring British identity.\n\nBritain has submitted several technical papers to the EU with proposals on customs arrangements after Brexit.\n\nHowever, the EU says London\u2019s ideas so far - on food and animal checks, customs and regulatory controls, checks on manufactured goods and market surveillance, among others - fall short and are not acceptable as alternatives.\n\nThe EU\u2019s Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last week that Britain had not presented any \u201clegal and operational\u201d proposals that could break the impasse, and many in Brussels doubt he is genuinely seeking a solution.\n\nJohnson said on Tuesday that he would submit \u201ca very good offer...very soon\u201d.\n\nHe denied a report on Monday by Irish broadcaster RTE that there would have to be border posts 5-10 miles (8-16 km) back from the border, an idea Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney quickly called a \u201cnon-starter\u201d.\n\nHowever, Johnson said there would have to be some checks on the island of Ireland.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the reality,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in the end, a sovereign, united country must have a single customs territory.\u201d", "description": "The 500-km (300-mile) land border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland has become the sticking point in efforts to agree on the terms of an orderly British exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["John Chalmers", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
