Rwanda has in the past seen incursions by fighters from the rebel FDLR force from their bases in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe FDLR is composed of former Rwandan soldiers and Hutu militias who fled after taking part in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.\n\n(Corrects number of assailants killed to 19, not 18)", "description": "Rwandan security forces have killed 19 people who were part of a group that carried out a deadly attack in a tourist hub in the north of the country on Friday, a police spokesman said.", "authors": ["Clement Uwiringiyimana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
