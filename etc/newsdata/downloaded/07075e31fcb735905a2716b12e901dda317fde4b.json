Friday\u2019s second round was washed out because of torrential rain at Accordia Golf Narashino Country Club, located approximately 35 miles east of Tokyo in an area pummeled by a typhoon.\n\nAD\n\nWoods ended up carding a 3-under final round of 67 for a total of 19-under, three shots better than Japan\u2019s Hideki Matsuyama.\n\nAD\n\nThe win also made Woods a likely choice for the Presidents Cup team that will play in December at Royal Melbourne. Woods, who happens to be the U.S. captain, will make his picks in November.\n\nWoods and Snead are the only two golfers with 80 or more PGA titles. Snead won his 82nd when he was 52. Woods, the Masters champion in April, is nine years younger.\n\nThe tournament itself was of a historic nature, as it marked the first official PGA event to be held in Japan. Woods hadn\u2019t played a competitive round in that country since losing in a playoff to Padraig Harrington at the 2006 Dunlop Phoenix, in the southern city of Miyazaki.\n\nAD\n\nWoods won that tournament in 2004 and 2005, and he led from the start in the Zozo Championship, but he admitted that Sunday\u2019s marathon session was difficult, calling it \u201ca long day in the saddle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long week. Five days at the top of the board is a long time, and it was definitely stressful,\u201d Woods said Monday.\n\nTiger Woods is the first player since at least 1983 to win a PGA TOUR event after bogeying each of his first three holes.\n\n\n\nHe ties Sam Snead for most wins in PGA TOUR history (82) and has twice as many wire-to-wire wins as any other player in PGA TOUR history (14).
