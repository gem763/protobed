Two months later, the White House proposed a budget that the Congressional Budget Office said would increase the deficit.\n\nIn June 2018, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the deficit was \u201ccoming down rapidly\u201d (it wasn\u2019t); he later clarified that future deficits would be lower. Since then, the federal deficit has grown to the fifth-highest level in U.S. history.\n\nAnd 17 months after then-budget director Mick Mulvaney said that deficit spending was needed to grow the economy, acting budget director Russell Vought told reporters in March that deficit spending was not needed to grow the economy. Over that time, the United States added approximately $1.7 trillion to the debt.\n\nIn March 2016, Trump himself promised to eliminate the entire national debt in eight years when it was at $19.2 trillion and made up approximately 76 percent of GDP. Today, it is over $22 trillion and on track to account for 79 percent of GDP in fiscal 2019.", "description": "", "authors": ["J.M.
