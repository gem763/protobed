This caused his condition, as well as epilepsy and a tendency to suffer from life-threatening seizures.\n\nOver the past year Jack and his family have been in and out of hospital as he was having regular seizures, but he has now been put on new medication which has stabilised him.\n\nBut he still has difficulties with his mobility and requires round-the-clock care.\n\nHe receives visits from Julia\u2019s House nurses to help him with his condition, but his mum has recently given up her job as a special needs nurses to be his full-time carer.\n\nHayley added: \u2018Jack is such a happy and social little boy. Despite his health and physical challenges he is a very determined and brave little boy.\n\n\u2018Today Jack uses a walking frame and sometimes a wheelchair to get about.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Stairs can be a struggle especially when he is tired, which is why the extension would be so useful.\u2019\n\nMORE: KFC is selling an 80-piece popcorn chicken bucket for less than \u00a36\n\nMORE: Boy diagnosed with dementia at 5 can only remember how to say \u2018mummy\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A little girl is raising money for an accessible room and bathroom for her disabled brother by designing Christmas cards.", "authors": ["Hattie Gladwell"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_92225109_1572015042.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
