Absolutely furious,\u201d Gosselin told the outlet in an interview published Thursday. \u201c[The network] didn\u2019t care. It\u2019s really upsetting that big businesses and big corporations go do whatever they want, against a parent\u2019s legal right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judge and the guardian ad litem both agreed that it wasn\u2019t in my children\u2019s best interests to be filmed, but my ex-wife and TLC had other ideas,\u201d Gosselin added. \u201cThey put profits and ratings ahead of the well-being of my children and filmed illegally without work permits.\u201d\n\nThe Gosselins welcomed twins Madelyn and Cara, 19, in 2000, followed by sextuplets Hannah, Collin, Leah, Aaden, Alexis, Joel and Leah, in 2004. They announced their split in June 2009 after 10 years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized the following December.\n\nGosselin made a shocking claim against Kate last month after a 10-year gag order had reportedly been lifted. The former reality star alleged the mother-of-eight mentally abused their 15-year-old son Collin and sent him to a special needs institution in Philadelphia for three years.\n\nJON GOSSELIN GETS TEMPORARY SOLE CUSTODY OF SOON COLLIN AFTER KATE GOSSELIN MISSES COURT\n\nJon said he removed his son from Fairmont Behavioral Health Institute last year after Collin wrote to him, begging for help.\n\n\u201cDear Dad, I\u2019m not trying to trick you, but I still love you,\u201d the teen wrote in a June 2017 letter obtained by the outlet. \u201cI told Mom [Kate Gosselin] I want to live with you, she said no. But right? She can\u2019t choose for me. I\u2019m old enough now, I\u2019m YOUR son, not hers. She was abusive to me after I left your house. I\u2019m sorry. Take this to court because \u2026 you\u2019re my dad, my savior.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving the letter, Jon fought for sole custody of Collin as well as 15-year-old daughter Hannah.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJon alleged that Collin was diagnosed with ADHD and \u201cKate \u2026 couldn\u2019t deal with him.\"\n\nA rep for Kate Gosselin did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.", "description": "Jon Gosselin couldn\u2019t contain himself when asked about his thoughts on his ex-wife Kate Gosselin continuing to let their children film despite a judge\u2019s ruling that it wasn\u2019t good for the kids.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/7e7c9c3df260b510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-640_jon_gosselin_466238247.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
