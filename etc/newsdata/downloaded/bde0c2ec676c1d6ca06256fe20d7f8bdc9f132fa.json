But a World Rugby spokesman said the game is expected to be played.\n\n\u201cWe are confident that the match will go ahead as scheduled,\u201d a spokesman told AFP.\n\nWorld Rugby also said it would inspect venues for Sunday\u2019s four matches immediately after the typhoon has passed before deciding whether they can go ahead, as the crunch Japan-Scotland game in Yokohama hangs in the balance.\n\n\u2013 Flooded passageway \u2013\n\nThe potential cancellation of the Pool A showdown has prompted an ugly row, with Scotland \u2014 who will be eliminated if it is called off \u2014 threatening legal action.\n\nWorld Rugby has found itself in the firing line for staging the tournament in Japan, which is prone to typhoons and is also in one of the most seismically active regions on the planet.\n\nBut the governing body rejected a British media report that the back-up stadium for England v France was in Tokyo, not far away from the original venue in Yokohama, and that there were no contingency plans for the Japan v Scotland game.\n\nThe report was \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d, a World Rugby spokesman said.\n\nEven as the fate of Sunday\u2019s showdown remained unclear, Japan\u2019s players took to a sodden training field in Tokyo \u2014 wading through a flooded passageway to get there, widely shared footage showed.\n\nHagibis, which brought heavy rain and high winds to Tokyo on Saturday, even before it has arrived, has also disrupted the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka, where Saturday\u2019s qualifying session has been moved to race day on Sunday.\n\nThe typhoon is forecast to crash into central or eastern Japan early Saturday evening, packing maximum gusts of 216 kilometres per hour (134 miles per hour) Japan\u2019s Meteorological Agency said.\n\nHagibis is forecast to be the first storm rated \u2018very strong\u2019 to hit the nation\u2019s main island of Honshu since 1991, when Japan\u2019s category system was introduced.\n\nOn Sunday, as well as the Japan-Scotland game, Canada are due to play Namibia in the eastern town of Kamaishi, USA face Tonga in Osaka and Wales are against Uruguay in the country\u2019s far southwest, out of the path of the storm.\n\nBut most of the attention focuses on the showdown between hosts Japan against Scotland, scheduled to be played in Yokohama near Tokyo at 7:45pm (1045 GMT).\n\nHagibis will have passed by then but tournament officials will assess the safety of the stadium and transport infrastructure before deciding whether the game can go ahead.\n\nThere is much riding on the fixture for both teams, with Japan hoping to reach their first World Cup quarter-final and Scotland desperate to avoid being knocked out.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 Rugby World Cup officials defended their contingency planning and urged fans to stay safe as Typhoon Hagibis, which has already caused", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/12/f56e54_friday-game-australia-georgia-in-shizuoka-was-played-in-heavy-rain-rugby-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
