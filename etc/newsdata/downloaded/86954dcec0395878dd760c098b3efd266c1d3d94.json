This year\u2019s gathering is focused on the Pan-Amazonian region where the land is enduring catastrophic environmental destruction and indigenous peoples are threatened with multiple forms of cultural genocide. Catholics in the region are also affected by a severe shortage of priests, to the point that some are forced to go without access to the Eucharist for months, sometimes even years.\n\nThis particular Synod, which began on Oct. 6 and will conclude this Sunday, Oct. 27, has been anticipated for years, with speculation that the Synod Fathers, as they\u2019re called, may open up the possibility of ordaining married men to the Roman Catholic priesthood, at the very least in struggling regions like the Amazon.\n\nAfter three weeks of meetings here in Rome, with 10 of the 12 working groups discussing the ordination of married men, some Vatican watchers are speculating that the Synod may vote to recommend this major change in church law.\n\nExperts in church doctrine say that the change would be relatively easy since mandatory celibacy for Catholic priests is a \u201cchurch practice,\u201d and not a \u201crevealed dogma.\u201d\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the ban on women\u2019s ordination to the Catholic priesthood, a doctrine, Pope Francis has said more than once, that is unchangeable and not up for discussion.\n\nThough many will see married priests as a groundbreaking moment of progress in a church that has been retrograde in its approach to all issues related to gender and sexuality, it may cause a serious setback for women.\n\nProof of this is evident in the workings of this Synod.\n\nThere are nearly 230 male bishops, priests, and one brother currently meeting in the Synod Hall, 180 of whom will have a vote in the group\u2019s final decision. There are 35 women in the hall serving as auditors, 20 of whom are nuns. Not one of these women has a vote.\n\nLast year, Catholic women activists made international headlines when they campaigned for women to have a vote in the Synod. (The New York Times dubbed them \u201cmodern day suffragists.\u201d) That demonstration led the Synod Fathers to declare a greater inclusion of women\u2019s voices in church structures a \u201cduty of justice\u201d that requires a \u201ccourageous cultural conversation.\u201d\n\nBut they never managed to muster that courage. Women were denied a vote again this year. If married men are allowed to be priests, it won\u2019t be because a woman had any say in the matter.\n\nThe treatment of women at this Synod is consistent with the way women have been treated by an all-male hierarchy for centuries: they are voiceless, deprived of any decision-making power, barred from developing church doctrine, and refused all opportunities to serve in sacramental roles. It is hard to imagine how the addition of more men into the current all-male clerical structure would do anything other than reinforce the second-class status of women in the church.\n\nA married male clergy will simply give more power to more men. Women will be made subservient not only to celibate men but to married men, too.\n\nThe inner workings of this year\u2019s Synod have been more secretive and opaque than usual. However, during the event\u2019s opening press conference on Oct. 7, a striking revelation was made by Sister Teresa Cediel Castillo, who ministers with women in the Pan-Amazonian region.\n\nShe said that women \u201cknow that they are baptized, and therefore, prophets and priests. Women baptize children. If there is a marriage, women witness and celebrate the marriage. If someone has need of confession, we listen to the bottom of our hearts. We may not be able to absolve according to the Church, but we listen with humbleness.\u201d\n\nPan-Amazonian women have empowered themselves and embraced the power of God that works through them for the sake of a people in desperate need.\n\nWhat will happen to them and their ministries if married men are suddenly given sacramental power and authority over them? Will the people still turn to women in their most crucial moments when a married man will be able to offer them \u201cthe real thing\u201d? What would stop married male priests from supplanting their roles?", "description": "Tetra Images/GettyThis week in Rome, change is in the air in the unlikeliest of places: the Vatican.Expectations are high that at the conclusion of a month-long meeting of Roman Catholic Church leaders, known as a Synod, there will be a recommendation to change the 1,200-year-old rule requiring mandatory", "authors": ["Jamie L.
