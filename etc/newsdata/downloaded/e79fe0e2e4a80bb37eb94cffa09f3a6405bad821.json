Hinch. \u201cFeeling like you did the right thing is putting Yordan in the game and have him have three incredible at-bats, the first one being the most impactful, just being able to hit a missile to centerfield to kick-start our offense.\u201d\n\nThe Astros seized a 3-2 lead in Major League Baseball\u2019s best-of-seven final with game six on Tuesday in Houston.\n\nAlvarez is typically the Astros\u2019 designated hitter, but three games in Washington under National League rules force pitchers to hit and bench designated hitters.\n\nBut Hinch said he didn\u2019t want to leave Alvarez out of the lineup three days in a row so he inserted him into a starting outfielder spot and reaped the rewards.\n\n\u201cThe homer he got to get the early lead, the two singles, it\u2019s huge to see him swinging the bat like that,\u201d said Astros shortstop Carlos Correa, who snapped a 2-for-16 slump with a two-run homer of his own in the fourth inning after an Alvarez single.\n\n\u201cNow we go back home and he\u2019s our DH at 22 for a reason. He\u2019s young and powerful and he\u2019s a great hitter. So we believe in him and we know he\u2019s going to keep it going.\u201d\n\nAlvarez was thrilled at his first playoff homer, which made him the youngest Cuban to ever homer in the World Series.\n\n\u201cVery happy with with the home run. All my teammates were saying, \u2018Today is your day.\u2019 And it happened. So very happy about it,\u201d Alvarez said through a translator.\n\n\u201cJust looking for a pitch to hit. Looking for something in the middle. Not really thinking about home run, just trying to make hard contact and it went out.\u201d\n\nAlvarez said that growing up in Cuba, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be here in the big leagues performing at the biggest stage.\u201d\n\nAlvarez took his off days and went to the batting cage to work on minor changes in pitching strategy and mechanics. They paid off.\n\n\u201cJust different adjustments to make, different pitches, and to be able to focus on any pitches in the zone, those were the basic things,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cVery happy to go back to Houston and do my job to hit as a DH.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Your night, brother\u2019 \u2013\n\nHinch said he wasn\u2019t worried about using Alvarez as a fielder in a pivotal playoff contest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely comfortable with Alvarez in left field,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cHe\u2019s limited in some ways in his range and in his experience, but he\u2019s not a liability. He\u2019s going to catch the balls he\u2019s supposed to catch. He\u2019s going to make the plays he\u2019s supposed to make.\u201d\n\nCorrea, from Puerto Rico, was happy to see Alvarez doing the work.\n\n\u201cI told him that\u2019s what great players do when they struggle, is try to figure out a way to contribute to the game,\u201d Correa said. \u201cHe went to the cage. He spent time in the cage. He put in his work.\n\n\u201cHe told me he was feeling great. I said, \u2018It\u2019s your night brother, let\u2019s go.\u2019 And he was able to contribute in a big way.\u201d", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Yordan Alvarez celebrated his return to Houston lineup with a home run and a 3-for-3 batting effort Sunday, putting the Astros on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/28/2d970d_houston-rookie-yordan-alvarez-celebrates-his-two-run-home-run-washington-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
