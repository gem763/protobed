The Kincade fire in Sonoma county in California\u2019s north had destroyed 123 homes and other structures by Tuesday morning and was 15% contained. Crews were also working to control a fierce fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles that had prompted evacuations on Monday.\n\n\u201cI know this moment generates a tremendous amount of anxiety,\u201d California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said on Monday about the two major blazes.\n\nStrong winds were expected to complicate firefighting efforts on Tuesday. \u201cThe worst of this [weather] is coming later today and tonight,\u201d said Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the National Weather Service\u2019s Weather Prediction Center, early on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe winds in the south will really pick up, 50 to 70mph, with some gusts up to 80mph in the Los Angeles mountain area.\u201d\n\nThe so-called Santa Ana winds in the south could hit their worst levels of the season and last into late Thursday, Chenard said, adding that northern California will not be spared either.\n\nUntil at least Wednesday, in the bone-dry wine country about 70 miles north of San Francisco, winds will hit up to 65mph in the mountain areas and 35mph in the valleys and coast, he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A residential area during a blackout in Redwood City, Tuesday.

The announcement came even before the last blackout had ended, which shut off power to more than 2.5 million people. It wasn\u2019t clear if power that for many went out Saturday would be restored before the next round of outages.\n\nWhat was clear was that patience was wearing thin and frustration at the utility was growing. From the suburbs of San Francisco up north to the wine country, people searched for places Monday to charge phones and stocked up on ice for the non-perishable food.\n\nPetaluma resident Scotty Richardson, whose lights went out Saturday, said the prospect that power might not be restored for days makes him \u201cfurious, furious\u201d.\n\nRichardson was out Monday getting breakfast, charging his phone and making business calls at the Lumberjacks restaurant in Petaluma. He vented frustration at the on-again, off-again rollercoaster of outages but also anger at the utility\u2019s role in causing deadly fires in the past, and apparently sparking some of this season\u2019s fires.\n\n\u201cPG&E can\u2019t figure out how to deliver power reliably without killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more than three strikes, it\u2019s a failure of epic proportions.\u201d\n\nPG&E, which was driven into bankruptcy because of legal claims over its role in several deadly wildfires in recent years, admitted on Monday that despite the outages, its power lines might have started two smaller fires over the weekend in the San Francisco Bay Area. It has also said its transmission lines may have been responsible for the Kincade fire.\n\nThe utility has been roundly criticized for its handling of the blackouts, the first of which came early in October. And in a new, 230-page report made public on Monday, PG&E acknowledged \u201csignificant shortcomings\u201d, admitting that its communication with customers and agencies was inadequate.\n\nPG&E stock dropped 24% Monday to close at $3.80 and was down more than 50% since Thursday.\n\nSouthern California Edison had cut off power to about 800 people as of Monday night and warned that it was considering disconnecting about 400,000 more as winds return midweek. The company also faced a growing backlash from regulators and lawmakers.\n\nUS congressman Josh Harder, a Democrat from Modesto, said he plans to introduce legislation that would raise PG&E\u2019s taxes if it pays bonuses to executives while engaging in blackouts.", "description": "Winds gusts could reach 80mph in the Los Angeles mountain area, and PG&E says latest blackout will affect about 1.5 million more people", "authors": ["Guardian Staff", "Bill Mckibben"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a2a6fed496fe881ebd17aa05195b3cfb9b766d/0_119_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57c03beca44aaaf9b63dabd816e4370b", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
