From what I saw, it was, as always, joyful, happy, and completely bad-ass. Brass bands played, whole oxen were roasted, giant loaves of gingerbread were eaten and a small ocean of beer was enjoyed.\n\nBut Germans, of course, don\u2019t just consume any old beer for Oktoberfest. Generally, the festbier that is made in the spring and then consumed during the fall \u201cdelivers malty aromatics, bready depth and full mouthfeel,\u201d says Bill Covaleski, co-founder of Victory Brewing in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe best of them do all of the above and leave a dryish impression that begs for another sip.\u201d He should know, since the first beer he brewed at Victory was a fest beer\u2014I was actually there on that fateful day back in 1996.\n\nWhile Oktoberfest beer is the king of all seasonal beers, it\u2019s not the only seasonal beer in Germany. There is bock during Lent, a special maibock in May and foamy wheat beer in the summer.\n\nWe used to enjoy seasonal beer in America, too. It was one of the things craft beer did best. We drank toothsome fest beer in the fall, winter warmers through the holidays, burly barleywine in the very depth of winter, invigorating bocks and maibocks in the spring and spritzy hefeweizens in the summer. It was so widespread, that I once wrote up a proposal for a beer-based \u201cbook of days,\u201d a calendrical compilation of what beers would be best for each day, and why, and what foods would make a proper feast with them, and recipes.\n\nI dropped that proposal, because seasonality doesn\u2019t really exist in our beer world anymore except for a few disparate days.\n\nBut Oktoberfest beer might be the way back to seasonal drinking.\n\n\u201c The loss of beer seasons actually started with, sigh, pumpkin beer and the seasonal creep it engendered. \u201d\n\nThe loss of beer seasons actually started with, sigh, pumpkin beer and the seasonal creep it engendered. Pumpkin beers became so popular in the fall\u2014along with flavored coffees, damn them all\u2014that they not only eclipsed Oktoberfest beers, which would have been sin enough, but they eventually broke the whole beer calendar. Unforgivable.\n\nBrewers, wholesalers, and drinkers are all to blame for this sad state of affairs. Pumpkin beer sales grew every year through the 2000s, and they didn\u2019t even slow down for the Recession. It\u2019s hard to tell, but my hunch is that pumpkin beers may have even triggered the whole pumpkin spice latte madness.\n\nBrewers joked about \u201cpumpkin beer zombies,\u201d the drinkers who would start asking in July: \u201cIs the pumpkin beer out yet?\u201d Wholesalers ordered big as soon as the pumpkin beers arrived because they wanted to sell through by Halloween despite people clamoring for pumpkin beer to have with Thanksgiving dinner. As a result, brewers started making the gourd brews earlier and earlier, because they didn\u2019t want to miss the early ordering frenzy.\n\nIt got to the point where pumpkin beers were becoming available in early August, and from there seasonal creep began to spread to Oktoberfest beers, which started going on sale ever earlier. Then we got winter beers in early November, and maibock in March...The calendar was blowing apart and the idea of beer seasons was becoming quickly obsolete. In October and November, stores could barely stock all the pumpkin, Oktoberfest and holiday beers available. It was like we were having dessert before our entrees and then finishing with appetizers.\n\n\u201c Then the IPA steamroller came out of nowhere, and shattered what was left of the beer calendar like plates at a Greek wedding. \u201d\n\nThen the IPA steamroller came out of nowhere, and shattered what was left of the beer calendar like plates at a Greek wedding. When all anyone wants to drink is variations on IPA, or simply any beer the brewer labels an IPA, seasonality goes out the window.\n\nAs a result, the growth of pumpkin beer finally trailed off and bocks gasped and disappeared. The only months on the beer calendar now left are December, because holiday beers are still hanging on by their fingertips, and September, the month of the hop harvest when fresh-hop IPAs come out. I could applaud the recent resurrection of harvest beers, but not when it comes at such a price.\n\nSo, how do we bring back seasonal beer drinking?\n\nFortunately, there are still pumpkin beers and Oktoberfest beers. (I never thought I would be grateful for pumpkin beer.) The demand is much diminished, but the heart still beats.\n\nAnd I accept that IPA is here to stay and chances are good that it will have a hugely long run.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to vanquish IPA, but to reclaim the space the calendar beers used to own. To do that, I need your help. Please grab a stein of malty fest beer, wrap it in a flag of Bavarian blue and white, and shout nein! to the IPA-crazed category.\n\nLong-time brewer Dick Leinenkugel is ready, and so is his Leinenkugel Oktoberfest Beer. \u201cWe definitely see the love for Oktoberfest, and there\u2019s an inevitable craving for something else when IPAs have been popular for so long,\u201d he recently told me.\n\nThere sure is. My wife and I love a good IPA, of many types, but when September comes around, we start buying (and drinking) Oktoberfest beers by the case. We\u2019ve been very happy with Sierra Nevada\u2019s series of collaborations with German brewers, including this year\u2019s with Bitburger.\n\nOne we can\u2019t get enough of is Von Trapp, out of Stowe, Vermont. I was happy to find it on tap in Philly last week, and jumped on it. I\u2019ll let brewer J.P. Williams describe it. \u201cThe style is a bit darker than traditional marzens [the German name for Oktoberfest beer], but the flavor is spot on. It\u2019s a mix of caramel, toffee and sweetness with the malt that is balanced with a touch of noble hops.\u201d\n\nThat flavor is a classic, and the balance of caramel, toffee, toastiness, and that hint of hop, is what makes tasting all of them in a season so much fun.\n\nSam Adams Octoberfest is often a bit heavier on the caramel. Hacker-Pschorr is, I think, a bit more pronounced on that toasty malt dryness Bill Covaleski from Victory talked about. And Jack\u2019s Abby Copper Lager is more firm with the hops.\n\nNo matter which one you choose, Oktoberfest beer is the key to jump-starting the beer calendar, the defibrillator jolt to re-set our seasonal beer heartbeat. Why? Well, for one, its name is a month; that\u2019s a marker. But mainly because it\u2019s just awfully good, and with a small move back to lager beer taking place, now\u2019s the time for it.\n\n\u201cWhy are they coming back?\u201d Williams asked. \u201cThey were awesome to begin with, and what took people so long to figure that out is beyond me.\u201d\n\nSo, here\u2019s what you need to do. Go get a six-pack or two and chill them. While that\u2019s working, grill some bratwurst, roast a chicken, cook some hot dogs. Heat up some kraut, and slice up some gouda and Swiss with honey mustard and a hearty loaf of rye bread. Pour those Oktoberfest beers and chow down.\n\nBecause it\u2019s time. It\u2019s the right beer season.\n\nNow that you\u2019ve got Oktober covered, what are you going to be drinking in November?", "description": "Our columnist hopes that celebrating Oktoberfest can bring back the tradition of seasonal beer drinking.", "authors": ["Lew Bryson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570737523/191010-HF-oktoberfest-tease_s1o7ls", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
