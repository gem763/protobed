Pressly, basically dragging his right foot, met Gregorius in the baseline and tagged him out.\n\nPressly, who grimaced as he went toward the dugout, had arthroscopic surgery on the same knee on Aug. 22 and returned Sept. 20.\n\n\"Just some scar tissue that broke off,\" he said. \"It was bound to happen at some point, I just didn't think it was going to happen in the middle of that game. I'll be good and ready to go next week.\"\n\nHouston won 6-4 on Jose Altuve's ninth-inning homer. The Astros will host Game 1 of the World Series against the Washington Nationals on Tuesday night.\n\nIt was the sixth appearance this postseason for Pressly. He was awarded the win in Game 4 of the ALCS after striking out consecutive batters to leave the bases loaded in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Astros used a bullpen game to wrap up the ALCS. Pressly was the third pitcher used and was replaced by Jose Urquidy to start the fourth. Urquidy allowed a solo homer to Gio Urshela, the second batter he faced.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
