He will not face criminal charges after the district attorney's office in Las Vegas ruled that the allegations could not \"be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nSoccer star Morgan has formerly passed indirect comment on the case via social media, tweeting (and eventually deleting) a VICE article about the Portuguese star titled \"Ronaldo is an icon of corruption in sports\" alongside the caption: \"Now this is great journalism.\"\n\nBut the Orlando Pride forward has now addressed the accusations directly ahead of this month's Best FIFA Football Awards 2019, where she and Ronaldo are both nominated for the top two prizes.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I don't anticipate approaching [Ronaldo] any differently than I would approach anyone else who I meet [in Milan],\" Morgan recently told Sports Illustrated.\n\nHowever, she added: \"I do think that a lot of times in today's climate women have spoken up, and it's important to support those women. And I think a lot of people right now are questioning who is right and who is wrong.\n\n\"When you look at this story in particular, I think there's too much evidence to cover up and I think at the end of the day money helps put stories down.\n\n\"The charges were dropped, so he can and does continue playing.\"\n\nShe added: \"What he does as a job and him entertaining people on the football field has nothing to do with who he might be as a person or the actions that he may have taken.\n\n\"For me, it just kind of taught me that although I'm still going to continue to stay true to what I feel in my heart and speaking up about important issues, it was really difficult to go through people having so much hatred with really understanding the story.\"\n\nRead more: The Cristiano Ronaldo rape allegations started with a chance meeting at a Las Vegas nightclub. Here's a timeline of everything that's happened so far.\n\nThe allegations against Ronaldo came to light in April 2017 when German website Spiegel published \"Cristiano Ronaldo's Secret,\" which detailed the alleged rape.\n\nThe piece named the alleged victim as Kathryn Mayorga, and claimed that Ronaldo had paid her $375,000 to settle a sexual assault claim.\n\nRonaldo's lawyers have since confirmed a sexual encounter occurred that night, but said it was \"consensual.\" They have also confirmed the payment of money to Mayorga \"to maintain the confidentiality of their dispute.\"\n\nSpeaking last month on Portuguese television channel TVI, Ronaldo said the allegations, which he strenuously denies, made 2018 the worst year of his life.\n\nMorgan is up for \"Best Women's Player\" at FIFA's upcoming awards night in Milan, while Ronaldo has been nominated for \"Best Men's Player.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nSimone Biles broke her silence over her brother's triple-murder charge, calling the shooting a 'tragedy'\n\nAntonio Brown asks for 'release' in Instagram post after Raiders reportedly void $30 million in guaranteed money\n\nDana White says Conor McGregor told him the sexual assault he has been accused of was 'somebody else'\n\nNOW WATCH: The US women's team won the World Cup.
