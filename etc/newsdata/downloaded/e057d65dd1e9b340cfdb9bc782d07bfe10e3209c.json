It thoroughly berates Comey for leaking memos about conversations with President Trump for personal and political gain. Most importantly, the report concludes Comey improperly released FBI material in order to launch the Special Counsel investigation into the 2016 presidential election. This report is separate from the highly anticipated IG report about the origins of the Russia investigation and FISA abuse.\n\nComey admitted during sworn congressional testimony in 2017 that he purposely leaked the confidential memos to a friend, who then gave them to the New York Times.\n\nHere is the IG conclusion and details about his leaking. It holds Comey accountable for setting a \"dangerous precedent\" by providing confidential FBI material to the media for personal and political gain:\n\nHowever, after his removal as FBI Director two months later, Comey provided a copy of Memo 4, which Comey had kept without authorization, to Richman with instructions to share the contents with a reporter for The New York Times. Memo 4 included information that was related to both the FBI's ongoing investigation of Flynn and, by Comey\u2019s own account, information that he believed and alleged constituted evidence of an attempt to obstruct the ongoing Flynn investigation; later that same day, The New York Times published an article about Memo 4 entitled, \u201cComey Memo Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn Investigation.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information falls in large part to the employees of the FBI who have access to it through their daily duties. On occasion, some of these employees may disagree with decisions by prosecutors, judges, or higher ranking FBI and Department officials about the actions to take or not take in criminal and counterintelligence matters. They may even, in some situations, distrust the legitimacy of those supervisory, prosecutorial, or judicial decisions. But even when these employees believe that their most strongly-held personal convictions might be served by an unauthorized disclosure, the FBI depends on them not to disclose sensitive information.\n\n\n\nFormer Director Comey failed to live up to this responsibility. By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees\u2014and the many thousands more former FBI employees\u2014who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information. Comey said he was compelled to take these actions \u201cif I love this country\u2026and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI.\u201d However, were current or former FBI employees to follow the former Director's example and disclose sensitive information in service of their own strongly held personal convictions, the FBI would be unable to dispatch its law enforcement duties properly, as Comey himself noted in his March 20, 2017 congressional testimony. Comey expressed a similar concern to President Trump, according to Memo 4, in discussing leaks of FBI information, telling Trump that the FBI's ability to conduct its work is compromised \u201cif people run around telling the press what we do.\u201d This is no doubt part of the reason why Comey\u2019s closest advisors used the words \u201csurprised,\u201d \u201cstunned,\u201d \u201cshocked,\u201d and \u201cdisappointment\u201d to describe their reactions to learning what Comey had done.\n\n\n\nIn a country built on the rule of law, it is of utmost importance that all FBI employees adhere to Department and FBI policies, particularly when confronted by what appear to be extraordinary circumstances or compelling personal convictions. Comey had several other lawful options available to him to advocate for the appointment of a Special Counsel, which he told us was his goal in making the disclosure. What was not permitted was the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.\n\nThe report specifically addresses a number of claims made by Comey that the memos he leaked were \"personal documents.\" The IG concluded the memos, which were written on an official FBI computer while Comey was working in his official capacity as FBI director, belong to the FBI. Further, after Comey was fired he held onto the memos, which was against FBI protocol.\n\nWe conclude that the Memos were official FBI records, rather than Comey's personal documents. Accordingly, after his removal as FBI Director, Comey violated applicable policies and his Employment Agreement by failing to either surrender his copies of Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7 to the FBI or seek authorization to retain them; by releasing official FBI information and records to third parties without authorization; and by failing to immediately alert the FBI about his disclosures to his personal attorneys once he became aware in June 2017 that Memo 2 contained six words (four of which were names of foreign countries mentioned by the President) that the FBI had determined were classified at the \u201cCONFIDENTIAL\u201d level. Comey told the OIG that he considered Memos 2 through 7 to be his personal documents, rather than official FBI records. He said he viewed these Memos as \u201ca personal aide-m\u00e9moire,\u201d \u201c like [his] diary\u201d or \u201clike [his] notes,\u201d which contained his \u201crecollection[s]\u201d of his conversations with President Trump. Comey further stated that he kept Memos 2, 4, 6, and 7 in a personal safe at home because he believed the documents were personal records rather than FBI records. Comey's characterization of the Memos as personal records finds no support in the law and is wholly incompatible with the plain language of the statutes, regulations, and policies defining Federal records, and the terms of Comey's FBI Employment Agreement. We conclude that the Memos are official FBI records as defined by statute, regulations, Department and FBI policies, and Comey's FBI Employment Agreement. Because they are official FBI records, Comey was required to handle the Memos in compliance with all applicable Department and FBI policies and the terms of his Employment Agreement. Comey Violated Department and FBI Policies Pertaining to the Retention, Handling, and Dissemination of FBI Records and Information Comey's actions with respect to the Memos violated Department and FBI policies concerning the retention, handling, and dissemination of FBI records and information, and violated the requirements of Comey\u2019s FBI Employment Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the findings, Comey will not be prosecuted. He has responded to the report with a false narrative about its findings:\n\nDOJ IG \"found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.\" I don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u201csorry we lied about you\u201d would be nice. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\nAnd to all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u201cgoing to jail\u201d or being a \u201cliar and a leaker\u201d\u2014ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) August 29, 2019\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\n", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:15:50AM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/165/879a8d02-8b8f-4721-8a08-70c1a273e326.jpg"}
