REUTERS/Juan Gonzalez\n\nJUMP IN ARRESTS\n\nOn Tuesday, prosecutors confirmed the death toll in the unrest had risen to 15 people, adding that 5,400 people had been detained by the security forces - a significant and unexplained leap from the 2,600 earlier confirmed by a government spokesman.\n\nThere were further, massive marches around the country, triggering more clashes with police and soldiers. In a poor area of Santiago, protesters were pictured hijacking a city bus to ram into a department store.\n\nIn an open letter to Pinera, rights group Amnesty International said it was concerned over human rights violations and limitations imposed by the military during city-wide evening lockdowns.\n\n\u201cThe sole fact that some groups or people have committed acts of violence in a protest does not authorize security forces to dissolve them with the use of force,\u201d said Erika Guevara, the group\u2019s Americas director.\n\nThe military general in charge of security in Santiago said he was aware of videos circulating on social media suggesting brutality by police or the military in tackling protesters and vandals.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating every one of these situations,\u201d General Javier Iturriaga told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hide anything.\u201d\n\nInterior ministry sub-secretary Rodrigo Ubilla initially declined to identify the 15 killed since last Friday, but the national prosecutor\u2019s office later named seven.\n\nIn a heated exchange with reporters, Ubilla said 11 people had died in arson attempts, looting and rioting in Santiago, while two people had died of gunshot wounds. Two others died in vehicle-related accidents, one outside of Santiago and one, further south, in the port city of Talcahuano.\n\nProsecutors said the Talcahuano death was that of a 23-year-old man run over by a military vehicle, and that a soldier had been charged with culpable homicide for the shooting of a man in northern Coquimbo.\n\nThe Chilean Institute for Human Rights said by Monday night it had registered 84 people injured by firearms.\n\nU.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, has called for independent investigations into the deaths in weekend protests.\n\n\u201cNEW SOCIAL CONTRACT\u201d\n\nPinera announced his new social plan after a crisis summit with coalition and opposition lawmakers on Tuesday.\n\nAlmost all the key left-leaning opposition parties rejected the invitation to talks until Pinera showed proof of safeguarding the human rights of protesters and removed the armed forces from the streets.\n\nMembers of Pinera\u2019s coalition and a handful of opposition figures who did attend the talks told reporters they had pushed for quick and sweeping reforms to quell the unrest and economic inequality.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to listen to what the people are asking for, which is profound social change. He must listen to the people, not just political parties,\u201d said former foreign minister Heraldo Munoz, head of the centre-left Democratic Party (PPD).\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nSome politicians and protesters pointed to a leaked audio recording of first lady Cecilia Morel as proof of a disconnect between ordinary voters and Pinera, a billionaire businessman who introduced credit cards to Chile in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been overrun, it\u2019s like an alien invasion,\u201d Morel said in the audio, which authorities confirmed as authentic. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to cut back on our privileges and share with the rest of them.\u201d", "description": "Chile's President Sebastian Pinera announced an ambitious raft of measures on Tuesday, aiming to quell protests against his government with a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in the state pension offering and the stabilisation of electricity costs.", "authors": ["Aislinn Laing", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443969190&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M06F", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
