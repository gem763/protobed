They will be rolled out to all Air Force personnel over the next three years.\n\nThe new OCPs were chosen because of superior design and fit, their resistance to fire and their capability to fit in with uniforms of counterparts in the Army and in other countries\u2019 militaries. Airmen\u2019s boots, socks and T-shirts will change over to \u2018coyote brown\u201d by June 1, 2020, and the current Airman\u2019s Battle Uniform will be phased out.\n\n\u201cOur airmen have made it clear with a resounding, \u2018Hey, we want to get into this uniform as soon as we possibly can,\u2019\u201d Maj. Gen. Robert LaBrutta, director of military force management policy, said in May. \u201cDownrange and in garrison, [airmen reported that] it\u2019s a better utility uniform than the ABU.\u201d\n\nThe new OCP has six colors, allowing its camouflage to better blend in with various environments, compared to the four pixelated colors of the ABU, and will cost $20 per set more. Insignia indicating rank will no longer be on airman\u2019s sleeves or officer\u2019s collars, but will be displayed in the center of their chests. Organizational patches and a U.S. flag will appear on the new uniforms as well.\n\nThe new uniforms have already been in use at Air Force bases in Afghanistan.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The U.S. Air Force, after a three-year wait, issued its new uniforms to recruits entering basic military training, utility uniforms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
