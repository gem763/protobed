A few of them, like Michigan and Pennsylvania, are traditionally Democratic. Others, like Florida, are tossups trending Republican. And then there\u2019s Arizona, the longtime GOP stronghold where Democratic gains are causing major heartburn for national Republicans.\n\nAnd Republicans are right to be worried about Arizona, says Cindy McCain, wife of the late Sen. John McCain, who represented the state in the U.S. Senate for more than three decades prior to his death in 2018.\n\n\u201cI can see [Arizona] going Democrat, I really can,\u201d McCain said during an interview for POLITICO\u2019s Women Rule podcast. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I want that, but I can see it happening.\u201d\n\nThere are, said McCain, two major reasons why: one has to do with changes in the state, and the other stems from the transformation of the Republican Party during the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge Hispanic population now that have found their voice in politics, number one. And number two, we have on my side of the aisle \u2014 on the Republican side \u2014 we see a local party in Arizona that\u2019s not functioning well, and it\u2019s excluding people,\u201d said McCain. \u201cIf you\u2019re not walking the line, then you\u2019re out. That\u2019s just not right. That\u2019s not the party that my husband and I belonged to.\u201d\n\nIn the year since her husband died following a long fight against brain cancer, Cindy McCain has largely stepped away from the public eye. But she has maintained a vocal role on two issues of deep personal import: promoting civility in politics and combatting human trafficking.\n\nIn August, the McCain Institute unveiled a new \u201c#ActsOfCivility\u201d campaign aimed at urging American citizens to foster a spirit of bipartisanship and open dialogue in their own lives, hoping that this behavior might trickle up, with elected officials in Washington following suit.\n\n\u201cThe inability to even discuss issues \u2014 differing issues \u2014 it\u2019s degenerated into name-calling and Twitter responses, and all of these things that not only do they not help the argument, but they don\u2019t help foster good relationships with people,\u201d McCain said.\n\nOne of the people engaged in incendiary Twitter theatrics is, of course, President Donald Trump, whose obsessive ire for John McCain continues in both public and private, even well after McCain\u2019s death.\n\nCindy McCain said she finds the president\u2019s behavior \u201cfrustrating,\u201d but does not intend to publicly engage with Trump. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, for me, it doesn\u2019t do me any good to dwell on the past or dwell on anything that\u2019s been negative or positive or whatever it may be,\u201d said McCain. \u201cI want this country to move forward. I want this country to be the vision that my husband had for it.\u201d\n\nThough some Americans see the 2020 presidential election as a chance to change the trajectory of the country, McCain doesn\u2019t see herself taking an active role in the campaign, even as she expressed a heartfelt fondness for Jill and Joe Biden, whose friendship with the McCains dates back to the night Cindy and John first met.\n\n\u201cIt was Jill Biden that was really pushing John to come over and meet me, introduce himself to me,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful he did, and I\u2019m grateful she did that. \u2026 Jill and Joe Biden and my husband and I were such good friends.\u201d\n\nThat friendship continued all the way through Sen. McCain\u2019s battle with brain cancer, said McCain. Throughout that time, and in the year since, Joe Biden has been \u201ca remarkable source of inspiration, kindness, and just a shoulder,\u201d McCain said.\n\nAs for whether or not she\u2019ll publicly endorse Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign, McCain demurred. \u201cI\u2019m really going to try to stay out of politics altogether,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cThis season, anyway.\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Cindy McCain, listen to the full podcast here.
