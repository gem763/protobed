[Photo provided to China Daily]\n\nLanzhou offers 'immersive' experience with food and music\n\nAlong the Yellow River, some fluorescent city lights shine when night falls and lovers of barbecue start looking for the next feast.\n\nThe river runs through Lanzhou, capital of Northwest China's Gansu province. Once dubbed China's \"wild west\" and nestled among mountains, Lanzhou has its charm. Special Hui food is found in stalls on the sidewalks of the river. Lanzhou serves as a bridge between the country's bustling east and its more remote west.\n\nThe thriving city is also rejuvenating its night life.\n\nAccording to local government data, the first half of the year saw the revenue of Lanzhou's catering industry reach 14.12 billion yuan ($1.99 billion), up 15.2 percent year-on-year.\n\nThe city has established 33 food streets in night markets and the business area has reached 250,000 square meters, with more than 3,000 households involved.\n\nOn weekends and during holidays, the city has many ways of welcoming outsiders: Walk along the banks of the Yellow River, over the Zhongshan Bridge and through the Baita Mountain area to downtown Zhengning Road, and you will come across food stalls and beverage stations where you can have skewered mutton or a bowl of egg milk rice wine. You could also try Yellow River beer alongside young Lanzhou people who gather nightly there to dance.", "description": "Lanzhou offers 'immersive' experience with food and music", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/09/5d9d3603a310cf3e97a03510.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
