While celebrities like Felicity Huffman broke the law to give their children a boost, there are a number of legal moves that are seen as giving rich people the ability to tip the scales in favor of their kids.\n\nOne of these methods is so-called legacy admissions, the practice of giving an advantage to children whose parents attended the school. Family history is considered in the admissions decisions of 42 percent of private colleges in the U.S., including many of the most renowned universities in the country, according to a 2018 study.\n\nChildren of legacies are estimated to be two to four times more likely to be accepted to elite schools. Having a parent who\u2019s an alum is the equivalent of a 160-point boost in a student's SAT score, research shows.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate\n\nLegacy admissions have been called \u201caffirmative action for rich white people.\u201d Critics of the practice say it gives priority to students who need it the least and undermines the idea that academic success should be based purely on merit. As opposed to race and income considerations \u2014 which are aimed at reducing inequality \u2014 legacy preference serves to perpetuate it, some say. A recent study found that 70 percent of Harvard legacy applicants are white.\n\nDefenders of legacy admissions say they create a generational commitment to a university that improves the campus community and makes alumni more likely to donate money. Those funds are needed to fund scholarships for students from lower-income homes or underrepresented groups, some college officials say.\n\nSome argue that it would be a shame to get rid of legacy admissions at a time when people of color have finally put themselves in a position to take advantage of them. Others say eliminating legacy preference would do little to fix issues of diversity on college campuses.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nWith some of California\u2019s most prominent schools at the center of the college admissions scandal, lawmakers in the state considered banning schools that receive state grants from using legacy preference. The bill was watered down significantly before it was passed, but the original draft could become a model for states that want to push colleges to abandon the practice.\n\nPerspectives\n\nOpponents\n\nLegacy preference makes inequality worse.\n\n\u201cPreferential treatment for legacy admissions is anti-meritocratic, inhibits social mobility and helps perpetuate a de facto class system. In short, it is an engine of inequity.\u201d \u2014 Editorial, New York Times\n\nIt undermines the American ideal that anyone can succeed if they work hard.\n\n\u201cAs we become a more diverse and hopefully more democratic nation, it just becomes harder and harder to defend these anachronistic practices that are deeply un-American.\u201d \u2014 Education expert Richard Kahlenberg to USA Today\n\nAll other countries have abandoned legacy admissions.\n\n\u201cThe United States is now the only nation in the world where colleges routinely use legacy status as a factor in admissions.\u201d \u2014 Richard V. Reeves, Brookings Institution\n\nLegacy preference holds back people of color.\n\n\u201cHarvard\u2019s preference for legacies places almost all non-white applicants at a distinct disadvantage.\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Lee, Los Angeles Times\n\nUniversities should prioritize students who are the first in their family to go to college.\n\n\u201c...efforts and initiatives to support first-generation students and others cannot be fully realized if practices that give preferential treatment to those from families of multigenerational college graduates continue to exist.\u201d \u2014 Peter McPherson, Inside Higher Ed\n\nPeople who oppose affirmative action should also oppose legacy admission.\n\n\u201c...those of us who detest racial preferences should despise legacy preferences twice as much.\u201d \u2014 Robert Verbruggen, National Review\n\nLegacy admissions don\u2019t actually lead to more donations.\n\n\u201cThe irony: Favoring the sons and daughters of alums to cement a relationship with the parents doesn\u2019t result in more donations.\u201d \u2014 Howard Gold, MarketWatch", "description": "The massive college admissions bribery scandal that has entangled Hollywood stars, wealthy elites and prestigious universities is drawing attention to a broader discussion of how colleges decide who to accept.", "authors": ["Mike Bebernes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ebb53PNHuZiaoCRTbeVv_A--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/66503a50-e183-11e9-9dda-ba03ee41c6eb", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
