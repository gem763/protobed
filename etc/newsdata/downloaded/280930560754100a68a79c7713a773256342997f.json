Luckily, no loss of life reported.\u201d\n\nThe hurricane was approaching the eastern end of Grand Bahama island in the evening, forecasters said.\n\nWith its maximum sustained winds of 185 mph and gusts up to 220 mph, Dorian tied the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane ever to come ashore, equaling the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, before the storms were named.\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!\u2014 The following message will be displayed to users with unsupported browsers: \u2014&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; Your browser does not support the &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;code&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;iframe&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/code&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; HTML tag.

But authorities warned that even if its core did not make U.S. landfall, the potent storm would likely hammer the coast with powerful winds and heavy surf.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster ordered a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast of the state amid Dorian\u2019s threat. The order, which covers about 830,000 people, goes into effect at noon Monday, when state troopers will begin reversing lanes so they all head inland on major coastal highways.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make everybody happy,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cBut we believe we can keep everyone alive.\u201d\n\nAuthorities in Florida also ordered mandatory evacuations in some vulnerable coastal areas.\n\nMore than 600 Labor Day flights in the U.S. had been canceled as of Sunday afternoon, many of them in Florida as Dorian barreled toward the state\u2019s coast.\n\nThe only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 190 mph (305 kph) winds. That storm did not make landfall at that strength.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic conditions\u201d were reported in Abaco, with a storm surge of 18-23 feet (5.5-7 meters), and Dorian was expected to cross Grand Bahama later in the day \u201cwith all its fury,\u201d the center said. The hurricane was moving to the west at 5 mph (7 kph).\n\nIn the northern stretches of the archipelago, hotels closed, residents boarded up homes and officials hired boats to move people to bigger islands.\n\nVideo that Jibrilu and government spokesman Kevin Harris said was sent by Abaco residents showed homes missing parts of their roofs, downed power lines and smashed and overturned cars. One showed floodwaters rushing through the streets of an unidentified town at nearly the height of a car roof.\n\nIn some parts of Abaco, \u201cyou cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins,\u201d said Prime Minister Hubert Minnis.\n\nAccording to the Nassau Guardian, he called it \u201cprobably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Minnis had warned that anyone who did not evacuate was \u201cin extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence.\u201d\n\nThe government opened 14 shelters across the Bahamas. Dozens ignored evacuation orders, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe end could be fatal,\u201d said Samuel Butler, assistant police commissioner. \u201cWe ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\u201d\n\nBahamas radio station ZNS Bahamas reported a mother and child in Grand Bahama called to say they were sheltering in a closet and seeking help from police.\n\nSilbert Mills, owner of the Bahamas Christian Network, said trees and power lines were torn down in Abaco.\n\n\u201cThe winds are howling like we\u2019ve never, ever experienced before,\u201d said Mills, 59, who planned to ride out the hurricane with his family in the concrete home he built 41 years ago in central Abaco.\n\nEarlier Saturday, skiffs shuttled between outlying fishing villages and McLean\u2019s Town, a settlement of a few dozen homes at the eastern end of Grand Bahama island, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast. Most came from Sweetings Cay.\n\n\u201cThey said evacuate, you have to evacuate,\u201d said Margaret Bassett, a ferry boat driver for the Deep Water Cay resort.\n\nBut Jack Pittard, a 76-year-old American who has visited the Bahamas for 40 years, decided to ride out the storm \u2013 his first hurricane \u2013 in Abaco.\n\nHe said he battened down his house to spend the storm in a nearby duplex. He noted the ocean is quite deep near where he was staying, and there is a cay that provides protection.\n\nA short video from Pittard about 2:30 p.m. showed winds shaking his home and ripping off its siding.\n\nOver two or three days, the hurricane could dump as much as 4 feet (1 meter) of rain, in addition to the winds and storm surge, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.\n\nHarris, the government spokesman, said Dorian could affect 73,000 residents and 21,000 homes. Authorities closed airports for Abaco, Grand Bahama and Bimini, but Lynden Pindling International Airport in the capital of Nassau stayed open.\n\nThe archipelago is no stranger to hurricanes. Homes are required to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a Category 4 hurricane, and compliance is generally tight for those who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer neighborhoods, with wooden homes in low-lying areas.\n\nAfter the Bahamas, the slow-crawling storm was forecast to turn sharply and skirt toward the U.S. coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday and then buffeting South Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u2019s East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line. The same area was put under a storm surge watch. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the state\u2019s densely populated Atlantic coast: \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet.\u201d\n\nHe suspended tolls on the Florida Turnpike and other roads, including Alligator Alley, from Fort Lauderdale to Naples, to keep traffic flowing for evacuees.\n\nDeSantis noted some forecast models still bring Dorian close to or even onto the Florida peninsula.\n\n\u201cThat could produce life-threatening storm surge and hurricane force winds,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThat cone of uncertainty still includes a lot of areas on the east coast of Florida and even into central and north Florida, so we are staying prepared and remaining vigilant.\u201d\n\nMandatory evacuation orders for low-lying and flood-prone areas and mobile homes were in effect starting either Sunday or Monday from Palm Beach County north to at least the Daytona Beach area, and some counties to the north issued voluntary evacuation notices. Weekend traffic was light in Florida despite those orders, unlike during the chaotic run-up to Hurricane Irma in 2017 when the unusually broad storm menaced the entire state.\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Dorian is forecast to be 40 to 50 miles (64 to 80 kilometers) off the Florida with hurricane-force wind speeds extending about 35 miles (56 kilometers) to the west.\n\nNational Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham urged residents not to bet on safety just because the specific forecast track has the storm just a bit offshore. Don\u2019t focus on the track, he said, but the larger cone of possibility that includes landfall.\n\nComplicating matters is that with every new forecast, \u201cwe keep nudging (Dorian\u2019s track) a little bit to the left\u201d which is closer to the Florida coast, Graham said.\n\nDorian is a powerful but small storm with hurricane force winds Sunday only extending 29 miles to the west, but they are expected to grow a bit. That makes forecasting its path delicate and difficult.\n\nPresident Donald Trump already declared a state of emergency and was briefed about what he called a \u201cmonstrous\u201d storm.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to hit but we have an idea, probably a little bit different than the original course,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut it can change its course again and it can go back more toward Florida.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the state could see heavy rain, winds and floods.\n\nThe hurricane upended some Labor Day holiday weekend plans in the U.S.: Major airlines allowed travelers to change reservations without fees, big cruise lines rerouted their ships and Cumberland Island National Seashore off Georgia closed to visitors. Disney World and Orlando\u2019s other resorts held off announcing any closings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Authorities in the Bahamas say they are receiving preliminary reports of heavy damage in areas being pounded by Hurricane Dorian; says one official, 'It's devastating'", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/bahamas_tropical_weather_70230_c0-120-2880-1799_s1770x1032.jpg?5a462229d3de71d993226ff82b6d4b518e407774"}
