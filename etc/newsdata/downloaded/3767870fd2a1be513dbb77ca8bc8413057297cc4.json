Trump began pulling U.S. troops back from northeastern Syria in early October, opening the way for Turkish troops to launch an offensive against the Kurdish fighters.\n\n\u201cWe have troops in towns in northeast Syria that are located next to the oil fields, the troops in those towns are not in the present phase of withdrawal,\u201d Esper told reporters during a visit to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to deny access, specifically revenue to ISIS (Islamic State) and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities,\u201d he said.\n\nEsper said there had been discussions about keeping some of the U.S. troops, who were with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in place. He said he had not presented that option yet, but the Pentagon\u2019s job was to look at different options.\n\nThe SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has been the main partner for the U.S.-led coalition in Syria.\n\n\u201cThere has been a discussion about possibly doing it (keeping some troops), there has been no decision with regard to numbers or anything like that,\u201d Esper added.\n\nA Reuters cameraman saw more than 100 vehicles carrying U.S. troops crossing from the northeast tip of Syria, where Turkey has agreed to pause its offensive for five days under a deal agreed between Washington and Ankara. The truce expires late on Tuesday.
