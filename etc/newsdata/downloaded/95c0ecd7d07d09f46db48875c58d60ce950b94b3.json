Are you an action sports junkie trying to capture your sick moves for a highlight reel? An aspiring cinematographer aiming to up your production values? Or a social media star hoping to supercharge your selfie game? There are great drones across a wide range of sizes and prices, and the best match depends on your answer.\n\nOkay, you say, but what if I\u2019m not sure exactly what I want out of a drone? Well, if you are intrigued by the category and want to get a taste, we\u2019ve picked the perfect starter drone, a unit that won\u2019t break the bank, but can still deliver serious footage and range. Along with that, we\u2019ve picked the best drone for amateur filmmakers and a unit that can satisfy all the needs of an outdoor athlete.\n\nThis article will be continually updated as new drones are released and reviewed, so be sure to check back if you\u2019re not buying a drone right now.\n\nThe best starter drone right now: DJI Spark\n\nAt $500 and 300 grams (less than the weight of three iPhone 7 phones), the Spark is DJI\u2019s most approachable drone. You don\u2019t have to learn how to fly a two-stick controller to get results. You can launch and land it from the palm of your hand and use gestures to move it around and snap photos. With the tap of a button in the app, you can initiate more complex maneuvers for more dramatic shots or set the drone to follow a particular subject.\n\nIf you control the Spark with your gestures or a smartphone, the range is rather limited. But if you want to get more ambitious, DJI sells a remote control that will allow you more fine-grained control and over a mile of range and a top speed of just over 30 miles an hour in \u201csport mode.\u201d\n\nThe camera only records in 1080p and is stabilized with a two-axis gimbal. But the results, when compared with most drones of this size and price, are spectacular. If your goal is to make great memories and have footage good enough to share on social media and YouTube, the Spark has you covered.\n\nA second option: DJI Mavic Pro\n\nIf you want a drone with a range and speed that goes well beyond the Spark, the next-best option is DJI\u2019s Mavic Pro. Like the Spark, it\u2019s quite portable. With its legs folded up, the Mavic fits easily into my messenger bag, and can even slip into a large jacket pocket. It has over 25 minutes of flight time on a single charge, a top speed of 40 miles and hour, and a range of over four miles when used with a remote. Importantly, it also has a larger camera with a three-axis gimbal, meaning your video footage is better stabilized, and can shoot in full 4K.\n\nThe trade-offs for this extra power and performance over the Spark come in the form of size, price, and complexity. The Mavic is portable, but definitely larger and heavier than the Spark. It\u2019s also twice the cost, retailing for $999. Lastly, unless you\u2019re a very confident expert, you need to have a flat surface to take off and land, not just the palm of your hand. And while you can use the Mavic indoors, it\u2019s much bigger, louder, and more intimidating to bystanders than the Spark.\n\nOTHER CONTENDERS\n\nThere are plenty of other drones on the market. Some might be better for you if you\u2019ve already bought into the company\u2019s ecosystem, or want more flexibility out of your camera gear. Others should be avoided at all costs.\n\nOur review of GoPro Karma (2017) Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Detachable gimbal doubles as handheld stabilizer\n\nComes with shoulder harness for mounting camera on your body\n\nWell priced if you already own a GoPro camera Bad Stuff Limited range\n\nCan\u2019t autonomously track subjects\n\nCan\u2019t sense and avoid obstacles Buy for $799.99 from Amazon", "description": "The right pick for pros, beginners, or adrenaline junkies", "authors": ["Ben Popper", "Jul"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4MVjuzWmffwuJ0Cu8ydALarRZQ=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8632397/akrales_170526_1710_0016.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-27"}
