The former Soviet stronghold is a fascinating historic destination", "language": "en", "text": "John Steinbeck described himself as being \u2018out-eaten, out-drunk, out-danced and out-sung\u2019 in Georgia.\n\nOn a visit with war photographer Robert Capa in 1948, he said its people had an undentable spirit.\n\nOver the course of Georgia\u2019s complex history that spirit has been tested, with invasions by Russia, the Turks, Persians and Mongols.\n\nGeorgian splendour: Narikala Fortress towers over Tbilisi, Georgia\u2019s hilly capital\n\nSince the country gained its independence in 1991, relations with Russia have been problematic. But although President Putin is not popular, there has been no conflict since 2008.\n\nToday, the centre-Right Georgian Dream party, led by a president and prime minister, are in power and the country\u2019s hopes to join the EU are encouraged by the pro-West youth.\n\nHospitality reigns in Georgia \u2014 sandwiched between Russia and Turkey \u2014 with locals keen to show you the historical sites, of which there are a great many, and even keener to make a warm impression. A taxi driver may try to waive your fare after getting lost, or the diners on the next table could strike up a song in a restaurant.\n\nThose who have visited the UK profess an affinity with the Cornish and Scots \u2014and as far as they are concerned, Georgian is the only, unalterable cuisine. Your glass will always be full of home-made wine or potent grape vodka.\n\nHome to just under four million people, the country is easily negotiable by car \u2014 and with direct flights from London, there\u2019s no better time to visit.\n\nImposing capital\n\nPerched between the botanical gardens and the old town, the 16th and 17th-century walls of Narikala Fortress dominate the skyline of Georgia\u2019s hilly capital, Tbilisi.\n\nAlmost a third of the country\u2019s inhabitants live here. Tbilisi \u2014 built on top of sulphurous hot springs \u2014 means \u2018warm\u2019 and the old town is full of bathhouses, such as Orbeliani.\n\nAfter your scrub down, stroll down the road to Culinarium Khasheria, which serves modern takes on local cuisine.\n\nA SHARED SAINT AND TOASTS GALORE The country has 12 climate zones, from subtropical to semi-desert. Visit in spring or autumn when it\u2019s warm (mid-70s fahrenheit) and dry.\n\nEngland and Georgia share a patron saint. There\u2019s a statue of St George in Tbilisi and his feast days are celebrated on May 6 and November 23.\n\nGeorgians believe they live long because the time you spend with guests doesn\u2019t count towards ageing.\n\nThe Caucasus mark the border with Russia and are the highest mountain range in Europe (Mount Elbrus is 18,510ft).\n\nThe Georgian alphabet is unique to the region and its origin has never been established.\n\nAt traditional meals, a \u2018tamada\u2019 will make a successions of toasts. Guests must finish their glass each time.\n\nThe city\u2019s imposing landmarks are easily reached on foot \u2014 the Mother Georgia Statue, the Peace Bridge over the Mtkvari river, and the vast hilltop house of former prime minister Bidzina Ivanishvili.\n\nVisit the grand Rustaveli Avenue, site of political demonstrations and home to Western chains and street art.\n\nIn the evening, take a walk around the streets off Liberty Square, stopping in unassuming but top-notch restaurants such as Salobie Bia and Old City Wall.\n\nOn Sundays, worshippers flock to the golden Holy Trinity Cathedral, where Patriarch Ilia II celebrates Mass before being whisked off in a black motorcade.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: The fortresses, monasteries and cathedrals of Mtskheta, the old capital, 45 minutes away.\n\nWHERE TO STAY: B&B doubles at the Radisson Blu Tbilisi (radissonblu.com) from \u00a3115 a night.\n\nWines and romance\n\nThe Bolsheviks were not particularly fond of stately homes, princes or poetry \u2014 so it\u2019s surprising that the 17th-century Tsinandali Estate, in the Kakheti wine region, an hour and a half\u2019s drive east of Tbilisi, is still standing.\n\nRefurbished by Prince Alexander Chavchavadze \u2014 soldier, poet and the founder of Georgian Romanticism \u2014 in 1835, this is where the country\u2019s 8,000-year-old winemaking process was formalised.\n\nThe house is now a museum and the vineyard produces about 150,000 bottles a year from 11 indigenous grape varieties.\n\nYou\u2019ll see vines everywhere in Georgia, but here they cover the facade of the 141-room Radisson Collection hotel, which opened in the grounds in January.\n\nA couple of days is plenty to visit the nearby Shumi and Telavi wineries as well. And if you need to tap out of being topped up, wander the ornamental gardens or flop by the rooftop pool.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: Georgian specialities \u2014 amber wines and chacha (grape vodka).\n\nWHERE TO STAY: B&B Doubles at the Radisson Tsinandali (radissonhotels.com) from \u00a3130 per night.\n\nThe Stalin legacy\n\nJoseph Stalin was born in Gori, an hour-and-a-half west of the capital, in 1878. At the museum dedicated to his legacy, your guide will say he was handsome and studious, great friends with Lenin and heroically escaped from Siberian labour camps six times.\n\nThis Soviet-era oddity produces eye-rolling from some Georgians, but it does house a fascinating collection \u2014 including one of Stalin\u2019s eight death masks.\n\nA 20 ft statue of the Soviet leader was removed from the central square in 2010 and it\u2019s the Georgian flag that flies from the 13th-century fortress on the small city\u2019s outskirts, but there is a lingering sense of respect for \u2018Uncle Joe\u2019.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: Stalin\u2019s railway carriage, built by the Romanovs in the 1850s.\n\nWHERE TO STAY: Day-trip from Tbilisi.\n\nHead for the hills\n\nGergeti Trinity Church provides spectacular views of Georgia\u2019s third-highest peak\n\nThe Georgian Military Highway splits this small mountain town of Stepantsminda in two \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t take long to find deserted green spaces in the Caucasus.\n\nFve hours north-east of Tbilisi, Stepantsminda is eight miles from the eerie Russian border, where hundreds of lorries queue to cross.\n\nHike the nearby Juta Valley \u2014 home of the best honey in Georgia \u2014 or visit Dariali, the country\u2019s largest monastery, and walk to the waterfall nearby.\n\nThe Gergeti Trinity Church is the main attraction; it\u2019s a sharp ascent that takes an hour (or you can drive) but the views of Georgia\u2019s third-highest peak, 16,512ft Mount Kazbek, are spectacular.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: Spotting Caucasian Shepherd Dogs \u2014 mostly strays, often friendly and always enormous.\n\nWHERE TO STAY: Comfortable but sparse doubles at Hotel Stancia (booking.com) from \u00a368 B&B.\n\nAn old favourite\n\nMounds of fresh produce on sale in Kutaisi, Georgia\u2019s second city\n\nKutaisi, Georgia\u2019s second city, is in the green west, has a population of about 150,000 and feels markedly different from Tbilisi, a four-hour drive away.\n\nOld men unload watermelons from their Soviet-era cars outside the Green Bazaar (central market), which is filled with a vast array of local produce.\n\nOn the surface this is old Georgia \u2014 it was the 11th-century capital, after all \u2014 with potholed streets and lines of crumbling houses.\n\nBut Kutaisi hides bohemian restaurants full of pastel-painted wooden furniture, serving makeshift cocktails, heaped dishes and playing early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. Two of the best are Palaty and Althaus.\n\nWalk off your meal en route to the thousand-year-old Bagrati Cathedral, overlooking the city. At weekends you\u2019ll encounter multiple wedding parties, arriving for short ceremonies before rushing off, horns honking, to celebrate.\n\nThis city is also a good base to strike out to the nearby Gelati monastery, Prometheus Cave (the largest in Georgia) or north to mountainous Svaneti.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: Toma\u2019s Wine Cellar, a family- run restaurant serving three courses and homemade wine for \u00a311 \u2014 the best meal you\u2019ll eat in Georgia.\n\nWHERE TO STAY: B&B doubles at Hotel Solomon (Solomon.ge) from \u00a350.", "description": "Hospitality reigns in Georgia - sandwiched between Russia and Turkey - with locals keen to show you the historical sites, of which there are a great many, and even keener to make a warm impression.", "authors": ["Hugo Brown For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/14/10/18471330-0-image-a-10_1568452287778.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
