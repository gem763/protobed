We have heard of attacks on cow trackers (they wear them to monitor the amount of milk given).\u201d\n\nOther larger devices Professor Slay says are at risk include small internet-of-things (IoT) devices such as connected security systems, thermostats, cars, electronic appliances, light bulbs, alarm clocks, speaker systems, vending machines and coffee pots.\n\n\u201cThere are huge unknown and unmitigated risks produced by the massive uptake in IoT devices. If they are not secured downstream, the risk is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nSecurity awareness\n\nSince IoT is here to stay, how can Australian business secure their firm from this latest assault on both their livelihood and their customers\u2019 safety and privacy?\n\n\u201cAustralian businesses need to first be aware of and find out which devices are connected to the internet, and find out which devices, if any, have any kind of built-in security,\" says Professor Slay.\n\n\u201cThen they must look at issues such as the embedded operating systems, which may have security vulnerabilities; the embedded hardware, which may have security vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThese devices may run for decades and never been patched, updated, or secured by passwords.\u201d\n\nSome devices may be covered by stringent regulation and testing, especially medical devices, or have very little protection at all.\n\n\u201cBusiness owners should consider the wisdom of using insecure devices in critical contexts,\" she said.\n\n\u201cThe people who own them may not even be aware they\u2019re present, and if they are, how to upgrade them \u2013 or if this is indeed actually possible.\n\n\u201cIt is incumbent upon every business owner to undertake a case-by-case security check or audit of all their devices.\u201d\n\nThe benefits of IoT\n\nThe rewards for getting the security right make the expense and effort worthwhile, Professor Slay says.\n\n\u201cIt means they will be able to use IoT devices for competitive advantage, to use sensors and gather big data, for positive digital disruption and flexibility for their business.\u201d\n\nFoolproof solutions are yet to emerge, she says.\n\n\u201cAs yet there is no consensus on how to secure IoT devices, and no comprehensive solutions have appeared to date,\u201d Professor Slay says.\n\n\u201cLooking to the future, we see large-scale acceleration of the use of IoT sensors, more excitement about their use, some development of security standards, but no obvious engagement with potential disruption.\n\n\u201cThe US Government has taken a legislative approach in some jurisdictions, but the growth in the market would make any proposed Australian legislation hard to police.\u201d", "description": "Security experts tell us that everything attached to the internet can be hacked, but a security audit is a smart first step for businesses wanting to shore up their defences.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7c21ef43e1692e14165b2831d75d3541b2a0fc58", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
