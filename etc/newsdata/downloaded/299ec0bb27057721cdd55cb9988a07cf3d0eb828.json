Gavin Newsom on Friday signed a bill phasing out all private, for-profit prisons and immigration detention facilities in the state.\n\nHe said the new law makes good on a promise he made in his inaugural address to end private prisons, saying they contribute to over-incarceration in the state.\n\n\u201cThese for-profit prisons do not reflect our values,\u201d Newsom said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation withdrew its use of two private prisons this year, the Central Valley Modified Community Correctional Facility and another in Arizona.\n\nThe new law comes four months after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it observed \u201cegregious\u201d violations at the Adelanto Detention Facility, a private immigration detention center. Federal officials said they observed overly restrictive segregation, inadequate medical care, unreported security risks and food safety issues.\n\nCalifornia plans to phase out its use of the Adelanto facility under the new law.\n\nAssemblymember Rob Bonta, a Democrat who authored the bill, praised Newsom for signing it.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a historic moment for California. By ending the use of for-profit, private prisons and detention facilities, we are sending a powerful message that we vehemently oppose the practice of profiteering off the backs of Californians in custody, that we will stand up for the health, safety and welfare of our people, and that we are committed to humane treatment for all,\u201d he said.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 California Gov.
