He faces a prison term of one to five years.\n\nPresley sat silently at the defense table. Green's relatives wiped away tears after the verdict was read.\n\nFormer Kingsland, GA police officer Zechariah Presley was acquitted Saturday on voluntary manslaughter\n\nTony Green was fatally shot by a now-former Georgia Police Officer Zechariah Presley. A jury acquitted the ex-cop Saturday on manslaughter charges\n\nPastor Mack De'Von Knight, whose church Green attended, denounced the acquittals outside the courthouse, saying the evidence was 'open and shut.'\n\n'He admitted that he killed Tony Green in cold blood,' Knight said. 'To me, it's hunting season for the young black man and we're being gunned down in the streets and there's no repercussions, there's no consequences for these officers.'\n\nThough Presley's body camera recorded his fatal encounter with Green, darkness and something covering the camera lens obscured the shooting and the moments leading up to it. That left the jury to weigh Presley's court testimony recalling what had occurred with a sometimes conflicting account by prosecutors and investigators.\n\nPresley said he followed Green's car on the night of June 20, 2018, because he believed Green was driving with a suspended license. Dash camera video showed Green drive the car off the road, then open the door and run. He briefly returned to the vehicle to grab an unseen object, then fled again.\n\nPresley chased Green on foot down a darkened street. A short struggle followed that's not visible on the video. The recording picked up the electrified clicking sound from Presley's Taser, followed by eight gunshots.\n\nFormer Georgia Police Officer testifying at his manslaughter trial. A jury acquitted him Saturday for shooting an unarmed black man, but found that he violated his oath of office\n\nThere was plenty of outrage in the community of Kingsland, GA, after a white cop, Zechariah Presley fatally shot an unarmed black man. The former police officer was acquitted Sat. of manslaughter\n\nAnother officer arrives afterward to find Presley lying on the ground. Presley says Green had been on top of him, trying to grab his Taser. Presley then says: 'And then I was going for my gun, and he started taking off. And I fired.'\n\nAn autopsy found Green was struck by eight bullets - one to his chest, the rest to his back and hips. Green also had small amounts of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and a tranquilizer in his system.\n\nOn the witness stand Wednesday, Presley added details he had not mentioned previously. He said he opened fire after Green turned back to face him and extended an arm, saying he feared Green had a gun. Investigators determined the object in his hand was a cellphone.\n\nA Kingsland, Georgia memorial in June 2018 near the spot Tony Green, 33, was fatally shot by a police officer\n\nPresley's attorneys argued the shooting was justified because Presley believed his life was in danger.\n\n'Tony Green was not shot because of misdemeanor offenses,' defense attorney Adrienne Browning said in her closing argument Thursday. 'He was shot because of bad decision after bad decision, until the threat was overwhelming and Zech feared for his life.'\n\nProsecutors said jurors shouldn't believe the revised account of the shooting Presley gave in court.\n\n'He made a fatal mistake and it was a mistake that cost a man his life,' prosecutor Rocky Bridges said of Presley in his closing argument. 'You don't have to like Tony Green. ... He ran from the police, not a good decision. But he was not armed. He did not turn on officer Presley. He did not deserve to die.'\n\nThe shooting of a black man by a white officer sparked protests by Green's relatives and other black residents of Kingsland. They argued a manslaughter charge wasn't severe enough for Presley, who was fired after the shooting.
