In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies,\u201d Mesires wrote.\n\nHe continued: \u201cHe will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden, speaking to reporters after a union forum in suburban Des Moines, Iowa, said his son did not discuss that decision with him before posting the statement.\n\n\u201cNo one has asserted my son did a single thing wrong,\u201d Biden added, pounding his finger into the podium, \u201cexcept a lying president.\u201d\n\nAnd Biden promised to bar his family members from occupying any office within the White House and said they won\u2019t \u201csit in meetings as if they are a Cabinet member.\u201d That was a jab at Trump, who taps daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, as advisers. Biden did not say if his pledge meant that his wife, Jill Biden, would not get the office traditionally assigned to first ladies, should he win.\n\nHe further vowed that no one in his family will have \u201cany business relationship with anyone that relates to a foreign corporation or foreign country.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s work overseas sits at the center of the House impeachment inquiry into Trump, who has admitted asking foreign powers to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings abroad.\n\nThe White House released a rough transcript of a call in which Trump asks Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to probe Biden\u2019s family and Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election that put Trump in office. Trump has also encouraged China to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s work in that country, asserting without evidence that earned $1.5 billion from a \u201csweetheart\u201d business deal there.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, is also under increasing scrutiny for his efforts to dig into Hunter Biden\u2019s business background. Late last week, two businessmen involved in Giuliani\u2019s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine were charged with federal campaign finance violations.\n\nStill, Republicans reacted to news of Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to step away from the Chinese-backed BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. with deep skepticism.\n\n\u201cI think this is just another way to save a flailing campaign that\u2019s going down,\u201d Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201dHe knows he\u2019s in trouble and this is just another way to try and detract attention\n\nOn the same show, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Hunter Biden \u201cshould have done this quite a while ago.\u201d\n\nMesires noted repeatedly that there is no evidence of wrongdoing against Hunter Biden, despite intensifying attacks from Trump before the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDespite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term,\u201d Mesires said in his Sunday post of Biden\u2019s experience in Ukraine.\n\nThe attorney wrote that Hunter Biden worked as an unpaid board member for BHR Equity Investment Fund Management Co. \u201cbased on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors,\u201d Mesires said. \u201cHe has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest.\u201d\n\nOne of Biden\u2019s Democratic presidential rivals praised the move, noting that Trump\u2019s children are openly trading on his name in business deals around the world while Trump occupies the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cI think it demonstrates the difference in standards relative to the White House,\u201d said Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\n\u201cI mean, here you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there\u2019s been no accusation of wrongdoing \u2014 doing something just to make sure there\u2019s not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interest,\u201d he said.", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Facing intense scrutiny from President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, Hunter Biden says he will step down from the board of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/fa0b7a_presidential-families-35833-in-jan-30-2010-file-photo-vice-president-joe-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
