Parents can also choose investment options to buoy returns on money for their child\u2019s education and then make tax-free withdrawals. It\u2019s named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, which created the accounts in 1996.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCurrently, more than 30 states offer a full or partial tax deduction or credit for 529 plan contributions. Research also shows that children with 529 plans are three times more likely to attend college, and four times more likely to graduate.\n\nOnly 23 percent of respondents in the Fidelity study said they actually owned a 529 plan, however, and some reported built-in obstacles to amassing a college fund..\n\nAbout 29 percent of respondents said their families didn\u2019t make enough money, while 26 percent said the cost of college was higher than expected. Some 25 percent said they expected to receive more from grants or scholarships.\n\nRespondents suggested researching scholarships and grants in order to offset costs, and starting to save as early as possible. About 34 percent believed that prospective students need to research and understand the implications of taking on student loans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Student loan debt is the highest non-mortgage debt in the U.S.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/studentloan-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
