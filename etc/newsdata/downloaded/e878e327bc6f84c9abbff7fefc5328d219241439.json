Grossi credits his \"stubborn positivity.\"\n\n\"It all boils down to the first moments that we spent together,\" said Grossi.\n\nGrossi said he had first spotted the dog \"bouncing around the battlefield in between gunfights.\" He first approached the dog when things began to calm down.\n\nFred appeared malnourished; his fur was matted and he was covered in insects. Grossi said he almost turned away from the dog when Fred began to \"wag his tail.\"\n\n\"I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' This dog has nothing to wag his tail about,\" Grossi recalled.\n\nAfter feeding Fred some spare beef jerky, Grossi said he felt an immediate connection with the dog, who \"gently and politely\" chewed what was his first meal in days.\n\nA \"blown away\" Grossi said it was this initial interaction with Fred that touched him the most, and he thanked Fred for teaching him an invaluable lesson.\n\n\"He was sending me a message when I came home from Afghanistan, and to all of us just about how we go about our lives and how when we feel completely justified in reacting negatively, or calling someone a name, or doing something nasty, or honking your car horn a little too long in traffic,\" Grossi said. \"Those are the moments that we need to dig deep and find us a reason to wag our tails.\"\n\nMARINE KILLED IN HUMVEE ACCIDENT AT CA TRAINING CENTER\n\n\"And his [Fred] life, if nothing else, is an example of how far you can go, and how different life can be if you do that\" he added.\n\nGrossi, not yet finished with his deployment, snuck Fred out of Afghanistan and sent him home to his family in 2010 to be nursed back to health, returning home later that year.\n\nTo hear Grossi's full story about how Fred helped him cope with the loss of those close to him during his time abroad, and the challenges he faced upon his return home, join Fox Nation and watch the inspiring episode of \"UNPC\" today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
