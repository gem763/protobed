For those that do expect to use one of these offerings, the vast majority expect to also maintain their Netflix subscription,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson said.\n\nNetflix shares fell 1.1% in trading Wednesday, from its previous close of $269.58 a share, amid broad declines in U.S. markets. Piper Jaffray has an overweight rating on Netflix with a price target of $440 a share \u2013 nearly 64% above the company's current stock price.\n\nBoth Disney and Apple are launching new streaming video platforms in the next few weeks. But Piper Jaffray's survey of about 1,500 subscribers found they don't plan to leave Netflix for Disney+ and Apple TV+\n\n\"Most existing Netflix subscribers appear to be trending towards multiple streaming video subscriptions, especially as many continue to reduce their spend on traditional TV offerings,\" Olson said.\n\nPiper Jaffray's confidence comes after multiple Wall Street analysts have sounded the alarm on Netflix' rising costs and potential losses to its streaming market share. As recently as July, optimistic forecasts for Netflix were nearly universal on the Street. But, since then, Netflix stock has dropped nearly 30% and erased its 2019 gains.\n\nWhile Netflix faces other risks, such as rising content licensing costs and eroding pricing power, Piper Jaffray believes the competitive threat is now priced into the stock.\n\n\"NFLX now trades at multi-year valuation lows, suggesting shares reflect much of the upcoming competition risk and periodic sub add volatility,\" Olson added.\n\n\u2013 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.", "description": "Piper Jaffray remains unfazed by the recent drop in Netflix shares, sticking by its optimistic forecast.", "authors": ["Michael Sheetz"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106060132-1565015076326gettyimages-973217394.jpeg?v=1565015111"}
