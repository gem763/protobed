The House this week approved a two-year, $322 billion spending increase. The Senate may soon follow suit.\n\nIf this happens \u2013 and the president signs off \u2013 this profligate spending would guarantee the return of trillion-dollar annual deficits, something not seen since the Obama-era recession.\n\nUnless Congress changes direction, our debt will balloon from today\u2019s unprecedented level of $22 trillion to more than $37 trillion in 10 years. That\u2019s nearly two times what our entire economy produces in a year.\n\nSuch massive debt can\u2019t help but threaten funding for federal programs \u2013 from national defense to Social Security, to safety-net programs for the poor. Next year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Washington will spend more on interest payments than on Medicaid. In six years, spending on interest will eclipse the entire defense budget.\n\nAlready, our accumulated debt is hobbling the economy. Numerous studies show that countries with debts as large as their economies experience slower growth, depressing wages and limiting new economic opportunities. The fear of debt-driven financial instability makes investors less likely to take risks on new innovative ideas such as long-shot therapies to treat cancer or new strains of crops that will flourish in hotter, dryer climates.\n\nGovernments are also less equipped to manage the next crisis when their balance sheet is already stretched to the point of breaking.\n\nSome pundits have been quick to blame the 2017 tax cuts for America\u2019s growing debt. They appear to believe that the federal government can tax its way out of its fiscal problems. But repealing the tax cuts would cover less than 7 percent of the current policy deficit and cost the average worker $26,906 in lost income over 10 years.\n\nWe could also raise taxes on the rich, right? Consider Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s proposal to slap people making over $10 million with a 70 percent tax rate. Her plan would only raise $19 billion in 2019, about 6 percent of the most recent budget deal and only 2 percent of this year\u2019s projected deficit. The 70 percent tax could actually lose revenue if all income (including capital gains) were taxed at a high rate because investors would simply stop actively investing.\n\nEven adding in other soak-the-rich proposals \u2013 such as a \u201cwealth tax\u201d or a tax on financial transactions \u2013 would only cover about 15 percent of the likely deficit over the next 10 years.\n\nIf Washington is unwilling to cut spending, Americans can get a glimpse of our financial future in Europe. There, workers toil two months longer than we do to pay their tax bill.\n\nThe only feasible way to close the deficit through taxation is by laying significant tax hikes on middle and lower-income Americans. Put another way, Congress cannot tax itself out of the budget hole it is digging without raising taxes on Americans who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nCurrently, Congress chooses to budget only about 30 percent of federal spending. The rest is on auto-pilot, consumed by mandatory entitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security) and interest on the debt. By 2041, all revenue will go toward entitlement spending and interest, leaving no money for the military, no money for infrastructure or education or food stamps. No money for anything else.\n\nThere are still reasonable paths to budget reform that include reforming entitlements to account for people living longer, healthier lives, removing duplicative and ineffective programs and encouraging competition in health care markets to allow more choices, better access, and lower costs.\n\nThe U.S. fiscal crisis is not likely to come crashing down around us all at once, as it did in Greece or Argentina. Instead, the current generation will just methodically march young Americans into a world of high taxes, high debt, and less opportunity.", "description": "With linked arms,\u00a0Republicans\u00a0and\u00a0Democrats\u00a0are marching our kids into a world of higher taxes and fewer economic opportunities.
