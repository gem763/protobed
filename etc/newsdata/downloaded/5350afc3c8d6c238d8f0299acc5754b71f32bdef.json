Really, New York is a movie star, with Paris as its only serious rival among the world\u2019s great metropolises. Its charisma is that of an old-fashioned screen idol, like Bette Davis, Cary Grant or Sidney Poitier. However many different faces the city might present to the camera \u2014 dressed up or roughed up, gritty or glamorous, tragic or madcap \u2014 it remains always and unmistakably itself.\n\nAnd like any human movie star worth talking about, New York off screen can be difficult as well as charming. It\u2019s seductive, demanding, elusive and impossible to separate from its image. Perpetually on, perpetually engrossed in the theater of its existence.", "description": "Is there an Oscar for Best Supporting Zip Code?", "authors": ["A.O.
