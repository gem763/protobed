While Orb\u00e1n's brand of nationalist politics enjoys strong support across the country, that's not as much the case in Budapest, where his Fidesz party won 41.17 percent in May's European Parliament election (and dipped as low as 31.72 percent in one city center district), compared with 52.56 percent nationwide.\n\nHowever, the anti-Orb\u00e1n vote has long been split, so many of the capital city's local officials, as well its mayor, are either members of Fidesz or backed by the ruling party.\n\nNow, the opposition is experimenting with a new strategy: a coalition of parties from across the political spectrum backing joint candidates in the local elections to prevent anti-Orb\u00e1n groups from competing with one another.\n\n\"It's the most united I've ever seen the opposition. Budapest is definitely winnable\" \u2014 Daniel Berg, opposition board member\n\n\"I'm very optimistic,\" said Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, a liberal who is running to be mayor of Budapest with the support of five opposition parties.\n\nSpeaking with POLITICO in his office in the leafy Zugl\u00f3 area of the city, where he currently serves as a district mayor, Kar\u00e1csony said opposition parties have been working to back single candidates in the capital's 23 districts. \"A few years ago, this would have still been unimaginable,\" he said.\n\nThe 44-year-old was selected to be the opposition's joint candidate for mayor of Budapest following a series of public debates and the first-ever primary, where Budapest residents could choose from three opposition candidates.\n\nThree liberal parties, as well as the socialists and greens, are currently backing Kar\u00e1csony, while the right-leaning Jobbik is not fielding a candidate against him.\n\nKar\u00e1csony will be facing 71-year-old Fidesz-backed incumbent Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s.\n\nMeanwhile, in the city's districts, as well as outside of Budapest, joint candidates were chosen after monthslong negotiations among opposition groups.\n\n\"You have to bring a lot of different types of political actors on the same platform, and these actors aren't necessarily used to working with each other. They come from different political cultures, there are some ideological differences to bridge over,\" said Daniel Berg, a 30-year-old member of the board of the liberal party Momentum, which won 17.35 percent of votes in the capital during the European Parliament election and 9.93 percent nationally.\n\nDuring negotiations on joint candidates, opposition parties looked at polling data and past election results as well as \"who has good local candidates, which parties are the most entrenched\" in each area, Berg said. \"It's the most united I've ever seen the opposition,\" he said, adding that \"Budapest is definitely winnable.\"\n\nBut like most local elections around the Continent, the race will in large part center on questions that impact residents' daily life. In Budapest that means a focus on issues such as rising housing prices, transportation challenges and poor air quality.\n\nAsked what he would tell a Fidesz voter to convince him or her to opt for the opposition in Budapest's mayoral race, Kar\u00e1csony said he would tell them that \"this election is not about Fidesz and not about the opposition,\" adding that Orb\u00e1n has taken development funding away from the capital and transferred it to provincial towns.\n\nThe prime minister has always had an \"anti-Budapest policy,\" Kar\u00e1csony said.\n\nIn a sign that Orb\u00e1n might be worried about the upcoming election, in late August the Hungarian government announced that it will distribute utility vouchers worth 9,000 forint (about \u20ac27) to each pensioner by the end of September.\n\nBut despite Orb\u00e1n's lack of widespread popularity in Budapest, some within the opposition camp are worried about low turnout, as well as the presence of other candidates not backed by opposition parties, whose participation could impact results in case of tight races. There is also a belief that some voters could opt for Fidesz out of fear that their area will be punished financially by the national government if they elect the opposition.\n\nAnd there are worries that even if Kar\u00e1csony wins the mayoral race, his city council could remain dominated by Fidesz, making it highly difficult to push through policies. Some opposition voters also question his record and ability to stand up to special interests and stamp out corruption.\n\nOne opposition insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the anti-Orb\u00e1n camp has a chance of winning in four districts of Budapest, while a further nine are \"maybes.\" Outside the capital, the insider said it is \"highly possible\" to see opposition victories in the towns of Miskolc, Szombathely, P\u00e9cs and Szeged, and \"maybe\" in Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros and Eger.\n\n\"This is not a celebrity post, you cannot live off of bluffs\" \u2014 Istv\u00e1n Tarl\u00f3s, current mayor of Budapest\n\nBudapest's current mayor, Tarl\u00f3s, who began his career as a liberal but has long been backed by Fidesz, declined to be interviewed for this article and did not respond to written questions about his campaign goals and record.\n\nBut in an interview with state-owned media over the summer, Tarl\u00f3s compared Kar\u00e1csony's knowledge of Budapest to that of an employee of a huge hypermarket who works at the back of the store, running a section on birdbaths.\n\n\"This is not a celebrity post, you cannot live off of bluffs,\" Tarl\u00f3s said. \"To some extent you have to get along with the government,\" he added, warning of significant harm for the city if its leadership fails to work with the national government.\n\nAsked what he would tell Orb\u00e1n if elected, Kar\u00e1csony said he is not running for mayor in order to take the city into battle.\n\n\"Viktor Orb\u00e1n's favorite political pursuit is war, he's always at war with somebody: with the [European] Union, with migrants, with George Soros, with liberals, with communists, with UFOs ... he loves to go to war. He does not want to with the Budapestians, because there are too many of them, that's what I'll tell him.\"", "description": "Opposition joins forces to try and loosen Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s grip on power.", "authors": ["Lili Bayer", "Anca Gurzu"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/budapest-1200x628.jpg"}
