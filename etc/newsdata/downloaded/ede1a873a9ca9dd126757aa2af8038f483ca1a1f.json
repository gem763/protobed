Agents of the Saudi government killed Khashoggi inside the consulate and apparently dismembered his body, which has never been found. Saudi Arabia has charged 11 people in the slaying and put them on trial, which has been held in secret. As of yet, no one has been convicted.\n\nJamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post writer, was killed in October 2018 after a visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain paperwork before marrying his Turkish fianc\u00e9e.

In Washington, Congress has said it believes the crown prince is \"responsible for the murder.\" Saudi Arabia has long insisted the crown prince had no involvement in an operation that included agents who reported directly to him.\n\n\"Some think that I should know what 3 million people working for the Saudi government do daily,\" the powerful heir told 60 Minutes. \"It's impossible that the 3 million would send their daily reports to the leader or the second-highest person in the Saudi government.\"\n\nIn an interview Thursday in New York, Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, told The Associated Press that responsibility for Khashoggi's slaying \"was not limited to the perpetrators\" and said she wanted the crown prince to tell her: \"Why was Jamal killed? Where is his body? What was the motive for this murder?\"\n\nWatch: Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e still seeking justice\n\nHatice Cengiz, the fianc\u00e9e of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, is still searching for answers and is asking the government of Canada for support. 0:56\n\nThe crown prince also addressed the Sept. 14 missile and drone attack on Saudi oil facilities. While Yemen's Iranian-allied Houthi rebels claimed the assault, Saudi Arabia has said it was \"unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\"\n\n\"There is no strategic goal,\" the crown prince said of the attack. \"Only a fool would attack 5 per cent of global supplies. The only strategic goal is to prove that they are stupid and that is what they did.\"\n\nHe urged \"strong and firm action to deter Iran.\"", "description": "Asked if he ordered the murder of Khashoggi, who had criticized him in columns for The Washington Post, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman replied: \"Absolutely not.\"", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4944516.1544725996!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/afp-1ab21i.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
