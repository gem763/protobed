It is the same conclusion reached by U.S. intelligence agencies: Russia wanted Trump to win and pushed pro-Trump propaganda on close to 150 million Americans through Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Google.\n\nBut in his \u201cunmatched wisdom\u201d Trump is pursuing delusional conspiracy theories about who is to blame.\n\nWhen Trump spoke to Ukraine\u2019s President, Volodymyr Zelensky, on a late July phone call, he asked for a \u201cfavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe server,\u201d Trump told Zelensky, \u201cThey say Ukraine has it\u2026They say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it, if that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nBy the way, Trump\u2019s request for Zelensky to produce information on the magical server preceded his putting the strong arm on his Ukrainian opposite number for dirt on his top political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump hits Fox News's Chris Wallace over Ukraine coverage Schiff: Whistleblower testimony might not be necessary Trump warns Democrats will lose House seats over impeachment MORE, as well as Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThe latter request set off calls for impeachment.\n\nBut the first thing on Trump\u2019s mind after reminding the Ukrainian president \u201cthat we do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d was to put the squeeze on him to investigate CrowdStrike.\n\nThat is the American private security company hired by the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to find out who hacked their systems. The answer from \u201cCrowdStrike\u201d was that Russia had infiltrated the Democrats\u2019 operation to help Trump win the White House.\n\nTrump apparently wants to rewrite history by shifting blame from Russia and pinning it on someone he described to Zelensky as \u201cone of your wealthy people.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department said in September that Attorney General Bill Barr asked Trump to contact these countries to help find \u201cthe origins of the U.S. counterintelligence probe of the Trump 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiRand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter Sunday shows \u2014 Officials rush to Trump's defense on Syria, sanctions Cruz: 'Of course' it's not appropriate to ask China to investigate Bidens MORE also has said the president enlisted him to identify the real culprit behind disruptions in the 2016 race.\n\nAnd last week two Ukrainians with ties to Giuliani were indicted on alleged campaign finance violations for funneling money to a congressman \u2014 former Rep.

First, \u201cto find people and information that could be used to undermine the special counsel\u2019s investigation,\u201d and second to \u201cdamage\u201d Biden, the Democrat whom many polls project could beat Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nAgain, the first order of business was to find information to turn attention away from Russia\u2019s helping hand to Trump in the 2016 election.\n\nAnd that fit with Trump\u2019s comment, while standing next to Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinPutin: Trump not to blame for lack of improved relations with Russia The Trump doctrine: Principled realism or endemic confusion?
