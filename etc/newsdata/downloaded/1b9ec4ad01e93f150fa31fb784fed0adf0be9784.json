Olivia Reiner, PackersNews\n\nIf you were guessing which young and unproven receiver was most likely to come through for the Green Bay Packers with Davante Adams out Monday night, Allen Lazard probably would have been your last guess.\n\nLazard was, after all, the lowest on the pecking order as the No. 6 receiver on a six-man receiving corps. He was a first-year pro who had one career catch (late last season) and had played but 21 snaps total this season going into this game.\n\nHe\u2019d also been cut at the end of training camp \u2014 a surprise cut, really, because receivers with his size (6-feet-5, 227 pounds) are hard to find, and he\u2019d played well enough in camp to warrant a look-see for the regular season. But after nobody claimed him on waivers he was back with the Packers on their practice squad, and then quickly promoted to their 53-man roster.\n\nAnd then there he was Monday night playing a prominent role (four catches for 65 yards and a touchdown) in the fourth quarter of the Packers\u2019 23-22 comeback win over their NFC North rival Detroit Lions.\n\nGreen Bay Packers wide receiver Allen Lazard (13) catches a fourth quarter touchdown pass over the defense of Detroit Lions cornerback Justin Coleman (27) during their football game Monday October 14, 2019, at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. (Photo: William Glasheen, USA TODAY NETWORK-Wis)\n\nLazard was on the field in large part because Aaron Rodgers had asked receivers coach Alvis Whitted to get Lazard out there after the Packers had fallen behind by nine points with about 12\u00bd minutes to play. And Rodgers fed Lazard the ball because the young receiver was bold enough to ask for it with the game on the line.\n\n\u201cThe thing that got me was, which you love as a quarterback, and that\u2019s receivers coming back and telling you he wants the ball and what routes he wants to run,\u201d Rodgers said after the game. \u201cThe big first down we had to him on the (15-yard) out route, that was him coming back to the huddle and telling me what play he wanted. For a young guy to do that, how can you not have confidence in that? So (coach) Matt (LaFleur) was between one of two plays, I said, \u2018Go with the first one because I\u2019m going to throw it to Allen, and we\u2019re going to move the sticks,' and we did.\u201d\n\nThat was a key play, but Lazard\u2019s 35-yard touchdown catch was his biggest and was a display of an uncommon level of trust in a player with so little playing time. Or it was a huge risk by Rodgers, depending on how you look at it. Because it came on a third-and-5 with a little more than nine minutes to play, and Rodgers, down by nine, decided to forego a short throw that would have kept the chains moving and went for the big play instead.\n\nThe quarterback dropped a perfect throw to Lazard over cornerback Justin Coleman, and Lazard made the contested over-the-shoulder catch that brought the Packers to within one score.\n\nLater, on the game-winning drive, Lazard converted a first down with a 12-yard catch off a Rodgers scramble and throw. There was also a three-yard hitch, then the big 15-yard out pattern in front of Coleman just after the two-minute warning that put the Packers in scoring position at the 22. That basically was the play that won the game, because it put the Packers in field-goal position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m made for stuff like this,\u201d Lazard said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m made for big moments. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ll never back down from.\u201d\n\nAnd to think, Lazard was there only because nobody claimed him after the Packers kept Darrius Shepherd over him on the cut to 53.\n\nThat move was a mild surprise because Lazard has the rare size that general manager Brian Gutekunst covets at receiver. While Lazard is not a burner (4.55 40), he runs well enough and coming out of Iowa State last year had an excellent vertical (38 inches) that showed he was an athlete, too.\n\nThe undrafted rookie Shepherd, on the other hand, had dime-a-dozen size (5-11, 186) and speed (reported 4.57 40 at his pro day), but was a plucky performer in training camp. He also had the conventional compact body type of a slot receiver, something the Packers\u2019 receiving corps lacked, and was a return man to boot.\n\n\u201cI was definitely worried (Lazard) was going to get picked up,\u201d Rodgers said, \u201cbecause the production was there in preseason. And the body type, there\u2019s just not that many guys like that who can run.\u201d\n\nAnd it was Lazard who came through Monday night on what was a forgettable night for Shepherd, who set up the Lions for an easy score by fumbling a punt return and cost the Packers points when a pass bounced off his facemask and was intercepted as he slipped at the goal line early in the fourth quarter.\n\nNot that Lazard\u2019s performance suddenly means the Packers have a burgeoning star on their hands. Their offense at times looked short of weapons, especially in the first half, and they are not the same team without Adams (turf toe) even if they did in the end put up 477 yards in total offense.\n\nThen again, this is why the Packers pay Rodgers $33.5 million a year. With no Adams, and with Geronimo Allison an in-game casualty (concussion evaluation, chest), it was up to Rodgers to elevate the receivers he had. And he did it, most especially with the dimes he dropped to Lazard on the touchdown and a 46-yard bomb to Marquez Valdes-Scantling earlier in the fourth quarter, as well as completing four passes and scrambling for 12 yards on the game-winning drive in the last 6:46.\n\nGutekunst still figures to be in the market for a receiver or tight end as the Oct. 29 NFL trade deadline closes in. Whether he finds a palatable deal for someone who\u2019s better than the guys he has behind Adams is another matter.\n\nThen again, maybe the GM found some help Monday night at the bottom of his roster.", "description": "Allen Lazard, the No. 6 receiver on a six-man receiving corps, played a prominent role in the Packers\u2019 23-22 comeback win over the Lions.", "authors": ["Pete Dougherty", "Published A.M.
