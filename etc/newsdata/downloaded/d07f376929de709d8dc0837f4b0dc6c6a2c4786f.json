One police car was also damaged.\n\nThe police said a policeman was slightly injured.\n\nEU states have been at loggerheads over how to handle refugees and migrants who have been reaching its shores since a 2015 spike in Mediterranean arrivals of people fleeing conflicts and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.\n\nMalta and neighbouring Italy have long complained that they have been left alone to deal with the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean in recent years looking for a better life in Europe.\n\nInterior ministers from five European Union countries, including Malta and Italy, said last month they had agreed on a new scheme to distribute migrants saved from the Mediterranean under a deal aimed at relieving the pressure on southern EU states.\n\nHowever, Valletta and Rome sought in vain to enrol earlier this month more EU peers in a migrant relocation scheme among EU countries they agreed with France and Germany.", "description": "Hundreds of people have been held in overcrowded detention centres and former army barracks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/21/adce8011d560405f97c057ead252aeda_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
