Ms Wall asked.\n\nTomovska is eligible for parole in nine months, but has a maximum sentence of 18 months\n\nThe court earlier heard police were following Tomovska's car after receiving a tip off that King would be the only one inside and could possibly have a gun on him.\n\nKing was the target of the strike force, with police reports suggesting he had links to firearms, the Illawarra Mercury reported.\n\nHighway patrol officer Nathan Grant and Senior Constable Joel Tuma followed the pair along the highway for around 10 minutes.\n\nThey travelled at 30km/h under the 100km/h speed limit, before speeding away when the police car turned on its lights and sirens to pull the car over.\n\nPolice dash-cam footage showed the officers weaving in and out of two lanes to avoid other vehicles while pursuing Tomovska, who was driving in the left-hand lane.\n\nEventually, the $450,000 dark silver Mercedes AMG abruptly pulled over to the side of the highway.\n\nSen Con Grant and Sen Con Tuma were then seen holding their guns up as they walked toward each side of the car.\n\nThe police officers later revealed that they were not expecting to see Tomovska or a child inside the car, but believed there may have been a gun inside.\n\nTomovska attempted to get out of the driver's seat, but Sen Con Grant waved his arm at her, instructing her to get back in the car.\n\n'Stop! Put your hands on your heads, hands on your heads! Do not do anything, do not talk, quiet, hands on your heads! he shouted at Tomovska.\n\nBefore her court appearance in August, Tomovska posted a photo of her pouting to the camera with the caption 'resting bitch face on for tomorrow. Practice makes perfect' to her 70,000 Instagram followers\n\nDuring the November 13 pursuit on the Princes Highway, Tomovska reached speeds of more than 200km/h before abruptly pulling over\n\n'Why were you running?' Sen Con Grant asked the mother.\n\n'Because I got scared,' Tomovska replied.\n\n'How can you go that fast with a baby in the car? You just went 200km/h in a pursuit with a [child] in the car,' Sen Con Grant said.\n\n'Can you give me a legitimate reason that you were involved in a high-speed pursuit with me today?\n\n'No,' Tomovska responded.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen Con Tuma put King face-down on the ground before handcuffing him.\n\nSeveral plain-clothed officers were then filmed arriving on the scene, before uniformed officers searched the boot and inside of the car.\n\nThey didn't uncover any weapons, but a search on the highway found a gun magazine in the nearby bush.\n\nOfficers then found Tomovska's unrestrained three-year-old daughter in the back seat.\n\nMargarita Tomovska's full conversation with police after finally pulling over 'You could've killed (the girl), do you get that?' Sen Con Grant asked. 'I do,' Tomovska replied. 'Over what?' he said. 'Over nothing,' she said. 'Nothing, stupidity, but at least I gave up.' 'That was nice of you,' Sen Con Grant replied. 'You were getting away from me too\u2026 you were getting away from me, you did all right. 'No those cars go all right,' Tomovska said. 'Yeah you done any driving courses or anything like that before?' 'No,' Tomovska responded. 'Just put your foot down?' Sen Con Grant asked. 'My mate is highway patrol and he was telling, I took him for a spin and he was saying (the Mercedes) are like highway patrol but on steroids those cars \u2026 yeah no chance if I kept going,' Tomovska said. 'You reckon,' Sen Con Grant said. 'It's not funny,' Tomovska replied. 'It's not funny, no it's not,' he said. 'I know it's not funny, I was just being a stupid idiot,' she said. 'Do you know what happens when a body hits a pole at 200km/h? \u2026 There is nothing left,' Sen Con Grant said. 'F**k that, but at least it's a highway,' she replied.\n\nIt was at that moment that Senior Constable Grant chatted to Ms Tomovska - and she admitted what she had done was stupid.\n\nMagistrate Susan McGowan brought up that conversation in court, news.com.au reported.\n\n'You could've killed (the girl), do you get that?' Sen Con Grant told the 28-year-old.\n\nTomovska and the officer continued their back-and-forth as she defended herself by saying 'at least I gave up.'\n\n'Do you know what happens when a body hits a pole at 200km/h? \u2026 There is nothing left,' Sen Con Grant said.\n\n'F**k that, but at least it's a highway,' she replied.\n\nTomovska's lawyers tried to argue that she was under duress from King to speed away from police, but the court found this wasn't the case.\n\nTomovska's lawyers tried to argue that she was under duress from her passenger to speed away from police, but the court found this wasn't the case\n\n'I was scared he was going to do something to me if I didn't do what he said,' she told the court that King yelled at her 'whatever you do, do not stop'.\n\n'He was telling me what to do... I was just focusing on the road,' Tomovska said of the pursuit.\n\n'I was scared if I didn't [obey] him he was going to do something to me.'\n\nPolice described King as a 'potentially dangerous man' whose body was so large officers needed two sets of handcuffs to restrain him.\n\nMagistrate McGowan told the court she was 'speechless' at the excuse.\n\n'It's obvious (Tomovska) could've told police at a later time as to what happened\u2026 there were numerous occasions where she had the opportunity to tell police that she was scared. She never mentioned it once.\n\n'Would a reasonable person act as she did with a little girl in the back of the car? I don't think they would.'\n\nTomovska claimed that her passenger, Christopher King, told her to 'floor it' after spotting police driving behind them\n\nTomovska had only known King for a week when she drove him down to Wollongong to meet up with a friend.\n\nSergeant Wall asked Tomovska why she would drive all the way down to Wollongong for a man she had only met a few times, and wasn't in an intimate relationship with, to which she replied: 'I love driving, that's what I do'.\n\nSergeant Wall also question why Tomovska didn't tell police she was scared of King at the time.\n\nTomovska said it was because he was right next to her, but Sergeant Wall also debunked that, arguing that King was by the back of the car getting handcuffed, while the Tomovska was at the front of the car speaking with officers.\n\nSergeant Wall also disputed Tomovska claims that King told her to 'floor it' after spotting police driving behind them.\n\nShe said that Tomovska hadn't mentioned the words 'floor it' until now.\n\nTomovska was found guilty of leading police in a chase in August.\n\nKing wasn't charged with any offences in relation to the incident.\n\nDonning a Versace dress and a black cape, the mother-of-one walked out of court and was driven off in the same Mercedes she drove in her high-speed chase.\n\nBefore her court appearance in August, Tomovska posted '#NotGuilty' and a photo of her pouting to the camera with the caption 'resting bitch face on for tomorrow. Practice makes perfect' to her 70,000 Instagram followers.\n\nIn May this year, she used her platform to beg for money to fund her lifestyle, claiming harassment from Raptor, a New South Wales Police strike force targeting bikies and related criminal activity, had stopped her being able to get a job.\n\n'I know you all don't know me but I'm actually not a bad person,' she wrote on a GoFundMe page.\n\nTomovska, 28, tried to raise $100,000 through donations, as she claimed she was unable to maintain full time employment after the charges were laid\n\n'These dogs are liers [sic] and have something against me for no reason as I'm sure I'm not the only one.\n\n'They have made it very hard for me to maintain a job as no one would hire me due to the bullsh** from raptor and ACA combined.\n\n'So I created this GoFund me to raise some support against the bullsh** that they have done to me and everyone else. It's about time we fight back. Enough is enough!\n\n'Thank you in advance for your support.'\n\nThe mother-of-one encouraged followers to support her by sharing the link on her Instagram story.\n\nShe later claimed she had nothing to do with the fundraiser and did not endorse it.\n\nTomovska declined to comment at the time as to why the link was shared on her Instagram account.", "description": "A Sydney mother who led police on a 10km chase reaching speeds of up to 200km/h in her Mercedes Benz - while her toddler daughter sat unrestrained in the back - has been jailed for 18 months.", "authors": ["Hannah Moore", "Alana Mazzoni For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19821396-0-image-a-20_1571289105455.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
