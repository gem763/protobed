But you won\u2019t find any in Mary Digges\u2019s apple butter, and for good reason. Its distinct lopsided shape means it doesn\u2019t sit straight in the tabletop crank peeler. And when you\u2019re battling to skin 10 bushels (about 400 pounds) of apples in a few hours, a trusty peeler, and at least a dozen good friends, is the only path to victory.\n\nThe friends are gathered by the Turner family, who have thrown an annual apple-butter-making party here in Bentonville for some 40 years. Back in the day, children were not invited. The drinking started early and ended late. And it wasn\u2019t unusual to find the apple butter still cooking and needing to be jarred at 2 a.m.\n\nThen 26 years ago, Digges, a stout woman with cheeks as ruddy as her beloved York, took charge of production. Now, the apple butter die-hards arrive by 11 a.m. and set up an assembly line at three picnic tables, covered in red-and-white-checked plastic tablecloths. Over the course of several hours of chitchat and a steady hum of country music, apples are peeled, cored and chopped into two-inch \u201csnits,\u201d then dumped into white plastic buckets.\n\n\n\nSlow Cooker Apple Butter . (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nA few feet away, volunteers led by Digges\u2019s husband, Linwood Burton, keep the fire going and stir two copper kettles with a long wooden paddle, swirling the snits into the bubbling, swampy stew. In the rare moments when the tireless Burton is not stirring himself, he instructs a younger generation on technique: when to add the next batch of apples, how to make the \u201ccrazy 8\u201d motion that keeps the apples from sticking to the bottom of the kettle. \u201cPlace the paddle against your hip and rock back and forth,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like slow dancing.\u201d These days, when all goes well, 25 gallons of apple butter is ready by 9 p.m.\n\n[Make the recipe: Slow Cooker Apple Butter]\n\nYou might expect that the tradition of making apple butter \u2014 outdoors and by the vat \u2014 would have disappeared long ago. It\u2019s time-consuming, labor-intensive: the anti-everything of our American age. And if the zeitgeist were not strong enough to do in the custom, the popularity of the slow cooker \u2014 dump in apples, press a button and walk away \u2014 should have banished it for good.\n\n\n\nAll hands are on deck to prep apples for making apple butter. (Christina Holmes)\n\nAnd yet the annual apple-butter gatherings survive. Throughout Appalachia and much of the South, families congregate in their backyards to stock up for the season, while churches, schools and social clubs join forces to make apple butter for community fundraisers. There are even annual apple butter festivals, like the one in Berkeley Springs, W.Va., which this year will celebrate its 45th anniversary.\n\n\u201cI remember being a kid and going through town and everything would smell like burnt molasses and cinnamon,\u201d says chef Travis Milton, who grew up in the mountains of southwest Virginia and is now culinary director and chef at Nicewonder Farm and Vineyards in Bristol. \u201cI assumed all that would be gone. But the culture is still vibrant.\u201d\n\nAs with most historic foodways, the tradition of making of apple butter began as a way to fill a need. Apples thrive in the mountains; perhaps counterintuitively, a slight elevation protects them from frost damage. Early settlers were keen to preserve the abundance. Fresh apples could be stored in a cold house or sliced and dried. But apple butter, with its concentrated sugars, was a powerful way to extend shelf life before refrigeration. Each fall, families would assemble to make fun of the hard work of putting up. \u201cApple butter making is like a hog killing used to be,\u201d said Eddie Williams, the proprietor of Williams Orchard in Flint Hill, Va. \u201cIt was a social event, but it was also productive.\u201d\n\n\n\nViews of the majestic apple orchards in Warren County, Va. (Christina Holmes)\n\nAt one time there were as many as 1,600 varieties of apples in southern and central Appalachia. Today, according to Slow Food\u2019s Renewing America\u2019s Food Traditions Alliance, more than 600 remain. There are Adam and Eves and Arkansas Blacks, Limbertwigs, Maiden\u2019s Blush, and Yorks. No wonder the alliance\u2019s founder, ethnobotanist Gary Paul Nabhan, has dubbed the region \u201cApple-achia.\u201d\n\nWhich apples are the best for apple butter depends on whom you ask. Milton likes Arkansas Blacks because they have a balance of starch and tart sweetness. Williams insists on a mix and recommends Yorks, Winesaps and Golden Delicious. The disagreement, says cookbook author and Appalachian historian Ronni Lundy, reflects the region\u2019s geography and its character. \u201cOne apple grew well on one part of a property, and another grew well on another, while the neighbors maybe grew different varieties entirely. It bred a kind of individualism,\u201d she says. \u201cYour family had your apple and you liked it better than someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\n\nHot apple butter is poured into jars for preserving. (Christina Holmes)\n\nFor Kendra Honaker\u2019s family in Bristol, the right apple for nearly a century has been the Stayman. That was the variety her great-grandparents grew in nearby Scott County. One year, when the two bushels of Staymans from the local orchard weren\u2019t up to snuff, Honaker\u2019s mother drove 85 miles to Asheville, N.C., to replace them. \u201cIt\u2019s serious business in our household,\u201d Honaker said with a laugh.\n\nThe family has not missed a year making apple butter since Honaker\u2019s great-grandmother, Nellie Mae Pullon, launched the tradition in the early 1920s. The clan gathers the day before to peel and chop; then the next morning, they build a fire in the backyard and start cooking. The Stayman rule is not the only one that is observed with reverence. The cooking vessel must be her great-grandfather Nelson\u2019s 10-gallon kettle. Lots of sugar \u2014 a contentious point with some aficionados \u2014 also is a must, as is a generous dose of cinnamon oil to cut the sweet. Each year, the family puts the same 1895 silver dollar in the bottom of the kettle because Nellie Mae insisted that it keeps the apple butter from sticking.\n\nIf there\u2019s any debate about the rules, it circles the question of Red Hots. Yes, those Red Hots. Starting in the 1950s, many mountain families ingeniously used the old-timey hard cinnamon candy to spice up their apple butter when cinnamon sticks or powder were unavailable or too expensive. Honaker\u2019s grandfather, Ray, was a fan, and he used to sneak a small bag into the pot when no one was looking. \u201cSomeone still runs to Walgreens to get them, and we let the nieces and nephews put them in,\u201d Honaker says. \u201cIt\u2019s a thing.\u201d\n\n\n\nChai-Spiced Apple Butter Cake. (Laura Chase de Formigny for The Washington Post; food styling by Lisa Cherkasky for The Washington Post)\n\nIs apple butter made the traditional way really better than one from a slow cooker or a store-bought version? Jeremiah Langhorne, chef-owner of the Dabney in the District, says \u201cif you do Pepsi challenge, you can tell.\u201d Some of it, no doubt, is the romance, he explained. When you open the jar, you remember the smoke rising into the crisp fall air and the fun of catching up with friends. But the process \u2014 eight or more hours of stirring \u2014 also means that the apple butter stays at a rolling boil, a much higher temperature than it would in a slow cooker, so it produces a richer, more complex flavor.\n\n[Make the recipe: Chai-Spiced Apple Butter Cake]\n\nThe other big question \u2014 what exactly do you do with 100 or so jars of apple butter? \u2014 doesn\u2019t seem to trouble the families who make an annual batch. Stick it on a cheese plate, put it in marinades for chicken or pork, or spoon a giant dollop into the batter for apple cake. Or you really can\u2019t beat apple butter French toast. If you\u2019re a bourbon lover, a dab of apple butter sands the sharp edges of a classic Old-Fashioned.\n\n[Make the recipe: Apple Butter Old-Fashioned]\n\nAt the Turners\u2019 annual party, the menu does not include anything made with apple butter. For one thing, there generally isn\u2019t any left from the previous year by the time the party comes around again. \u201cTo be honest, I actually don\u2019t like apple butter much,\u201d Barry Turner says, cracking open a Bud Light with a smirk. \u201cBut it\u2019s a tradition. We don\u2019t even think about, \u2018Will we have the party this year?\u2019 We just do it.\u201d\n\n\n\nApple Butter Old-Fashioned.
