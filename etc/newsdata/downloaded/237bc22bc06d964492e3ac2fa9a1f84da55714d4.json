USA TODAY\n\nWe know what LeBron James said.\n\nOh, do we ever.\n\nJames\u2019 comments haven\u2019t gone over well since he responded Monday to questions about China and Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s pro-Hong Kong tweet that instigated a crisis for the NBA.\n\nWhen James said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get in a word or sentence feud with Daryl Morey. But I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand and he spoke,\" he should have said, \u201cI support democracy, free speech and denounce human rights abuses throughout the world. It wasn\u2019t a good week for the NBA, and Daryl\u2019s tweet put the players and the league in a challenging situation. That\u2019s all I have to say on the topic.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not what James said, which is his choice, but the fallout \u2013 at least in terms of criticism \u2013 has been significant. It's not known yet if there is a financial cost, but his reputation took a hit as his \"More Than An Athlete\" mantra runs hollow.\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers.

You\u2019d have to go back to the conclusion of the 2011 NBA Finals between Miami and Dallas when James spoke about the people who were happy to see him fail. This is the harshest criticism he has received since then.\n\nThere were several approaches the Los Angeles Lakers superstar could have taken this week but did not.\n\nJames also said Monday: \"So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually. Just be careful what we tweet, what we say and what we do. We do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too.\"\n\nHe could have said: \"Daryl has a right to say what he wants, especially if he is passionate about it, but perhaps he didn't foresee the impact his tweet would have on those who had to answer for him in Japan and China.\"\n\nHe also could have said: \u201cIt was a tense situation, but it wasn\u2019t just the players who were concerned. The NBA had several staffers in China, including a couple hundred who work for NBA China and have to remain there after we leave.\u201d\n\nAnd since James brought up the financial impact, that can be addressed, too. Yes, the NBA and its players benefit from the league\u2019s partnerships with China, and players benefit individually based on endorsement deals. James had three appearances canceled, and one Lakers player had a $1 million deal withdrawn in China, ESPN reported.\n\nJames could have said, in a brutally honest way, he wishes to make money for different reasons.\n\n\u201cCapitalism has been a part of life for centuries, and some of the money my teammates and I make goes back into the community to help people,\" James could have said. \"There are hundreds of American companies who do business in China for the sake of making significant profit. If we want to have a larger discussion about the cost of doing business in China and whether that\u2019s worth it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nJames could have also said: \u201cWhen we talk about the political side, I think it\u2019s a very delicate situation, a very sensitive situation. And for me personally, if any you guys know me or always cover me, you guys know when I speak about something, I always speak about something I\u2019m very knowledgeable about, something that hits home for me, something I\u2019m very passionate about. And I felt like with this particular situation, not only was I not informed enough about, I just felt like it was something that my teammates or my organization had enough to talk about it at that time, and we still feel the same way.\u201d\n\nWait, that's one quote James actually said.\n\nA demonstrator stomps on LeBron James jerseys during a rally in Hong Kong. (Photo: Mark Schiefelbein, AP)\n\nHe also said, \u201cI also don\u2019t think every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem.\"\n\nHe could have left that unspoken and said, \u201cThere\u2019s things that happen in my own community in trying to help my kids graduate high school and go off to college. That's been my main concern the last couple of years with my school, trying to make sure the inner city kids that grow up in my hometown can have a brighter future and look at me as an inspiration to get out of the hellhole of the inner city.\u201d\n\nOh wait, James actually said that, too.\n\nBut the valid points he made got lost amid all the other things he should have avoided. He is, after all, free to say what he wants.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "description": "LeBron James said a bunch of things that didn't go over well.
