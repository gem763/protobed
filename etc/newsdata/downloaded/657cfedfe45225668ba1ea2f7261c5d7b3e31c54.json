The abiding memory of the Seoul game in April 2009 was the eternally glum North Korea coach, Kim Jong-hun, striding into the post-match press conference flanked by two minders. Taking no questions, the trench coat-wearing tactician accused the hosts of poisoning his players and then stormed out, pushing bewildered South Korea FA officials out of the way.\n\nThere was a much more positive atmosphere in the qualifier that had been scheduled to be held in Pyongyang a few months earlier. With the two countries technically still at war, Dear Leader Kim Jong-il moved the home tie to Shanghai as the prospect of seeing the flag of the south flutter and its anthem ring around the stadium named after his (and the nation\u2019s) father Kim Il-sung was a bit too much.\n\nGareth Southgate\u2019s England gamble after James Maddison\u2019s casino visit | David Hytner Read more\n\nThe game in China was an emotional affair, with fans from both sides of the 38th parallel in fine voice. At the end, the southern players bowed to the white-clad northern cheer squad and were warmly clapped and vice versa (well, the north\u2019s players did not bow but did acknowledge the crowd). Even the Chinese journalists were moved and talked wistfully of one day doing the same with Taiwan.\n\nAt least both episodes distracted from the football on display: games between the rivals are often dull. The desire to avoid defeat does not help, resulting in plenty of huff and puff and little else. The atmosphere is often surreal too because of neutral venues or supporters in the south being a little unsure how to act when faced with their fellow Koreans. There is more needle when both face their former coloniser, Japan, and even China.\n\nThis time could be different. Nobody knows what Pyongyang will be like. South Korea have played there only once, in a 1990 friendly that remains the north\u2019s only victory in this fixture (the women played at the Kim Il-sung Stadium in 2017 in an Asian Cup qualifier). The DPRK capital is more a novel football experience than an intimidating one, with a World Cup qualifier against Iran in 2005 an exception when fans stormed the visitors\u2019 dressing rooms and bus after a controversial defeat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest North Korea, in white, and South Korea salute the crowd in Seoul after their meeting there in April 2009.

The federation has been communicating with the AFC and did not respond to requests for information from its Seoul counterpart.\n\nThere will be no South Korean journalists or fans allowed and the game is not being televised. On the flip side, there is the joint Korean bid in the offing for the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup (an idea raised by Fifa), which means it is in a lot of people\u2019s interest that it goes smoothly off the pitch.\n\nGiven the fact four goals have been scored in the past six meetings (South Korea got three of those), being unable to watch may not be a big deal but then the sides have a little more attacking talent these days. There is Son Heung-min of course, ready to make his first appearance against the neighbours. Son, recently linked with Napoli and Real Madrid, has rarely managed to look quite as good for his country as for Tottenham, even if he did score twice in an 8-0 thrashing of Sri Lanka last week. The result means both Koreas have six points from two games, though only the winners of the five-team group are certain of a place in the next stage.\n\nThere are calls for Son to partner the in-form Hwang Hee-chan, last seen scoring for Salzburg against Liverpool after making Virgil van Dijk look foolish.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Han Kwang-song leaps over Sri Lanka\u2019s Manaram Perera during North Korea\u2019s 1-0 win last week.

In recent years they have become one of Asia\u2019s most unpredictable teams. They lost six straight games at the turn of the year, conceding no fewer than 27 goals against Bahrain, Qatar, Uzbekistan, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. Things have tightened up, with two conceded in the past five, though the opposition have been weaker.\n\nMuch depends on Han Kwang-song, the explosive forward who recently joined Juventus. Known as the \u201cNorth\u2019s Ronaldo\u201d in Seoul, this No 7 has had an expansive football education in Pyongyang, Spain and Italy.\n\nQatar 2022 is a long shot though. Unlike for the 2010 tournament, North Korea look short of the quality needed to get to the World Cup but beating the south \u2013 who are aiming for a 10th successive appearance on the global stage \u2013 for the first time in almost three decades would go down very well in Pyongyang and perhaps ensure the headlines this time are football ones.", "description": "World Cup qualifier is first competitive men\u2019s game between North and South in Pyongyang and pits Tottenham\u2019s Son against Han Kwang-song", "authors": ["John Duerden"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/831850e3ae2de849a0549f6ad8e65b649b134fec/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4aa548ef4bdb13185e65438164c917d0", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
