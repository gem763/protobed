The price is down more than 8% in the past three sessions and it is now trading below the USD 7,550 pivot level.\n\nSimilarly, there were strong downsides in ethereum, EOS, ripple, bitcoin cash, litecoin, binance coin, ADA and XLM. ETH/USD is down more than 8% and it broke the key USD 160 support area.
