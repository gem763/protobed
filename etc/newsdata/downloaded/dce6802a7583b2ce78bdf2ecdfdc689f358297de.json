And sparked by batters going for the fences to beat suffocating shifts, strikeouts set a record for the 12th year in a row and outnumbered hits for the second straight season.\n\nWith some teams out of contention even before their first pitch, average attendance has dropped four years in a row for the first time since the commissioner\u2019s office started tracking it in 1980.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to draw 68-plus million people at the big league level,\u201d baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said this week, \u201canother 41 million in minor league baseball - they\u2019re actually going to be up. I\u2019ll take 110 million people going to see the sport live. That\u2019s a really, really awesome number in an environment where people have more and more and more alternatives to consume.\u201d\n\nMore and more teams have adopted an all-in or all-out philosophy. If they don\u2019t think they can win it, why bother to be in it? Better to shed expensive veterans and rebuild with cheaper rookies - and incur the box-office hit. Management calls that prudent rebuilding. The players\u2019 association labels it tanking.\n\n\u201cWe have some of the most remarkably talented players our game has seen as a whole in a long time,\u201d union head Tony Clark said. \u201cBut the willful failure of too many franchises to field competitive teams and put their best players on the field is unquestionably hurting our industry.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco has dropped from 3.2 million fans at home to about 2.7 million, Seattle and Toronto both from 2.3 million to about 1.8 million. Baltimore drew 1.3 million, its lowest total at home in a non-strike shortened season since 1978. Kansas City\u2019s 1.5 million is its lowest since 2006.\n\nWhile Philadelphia rose by about 500,000 following the signing of Bryce Harper and Minnesota by 300,000 during the Twins\u2019 winningest regular season in a half-century and San Diego by over 200,000 after adding Manny Machado, about half the teams are headed to declines. This year\u2019s drop was just around 2% with three days left in the regular season, from 28,830 to 28,252, but the final average should rise slightly after weekend games. The average fell below 30,000 last year for the first time since 2003.\n\nManfred points to increases in television viewers. Fox is up 9% this year and at a seven-year high, and local broadcasts are first in prime time in 24 of 25 markets. Use of MLB\u2019s At-Bat app is up 18%.\n\nStill, wins and attendance are correlated in many markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of games this year, a few more than we wanted to, but ultimately it\u2019s about getting on the right side of things and sometimes you do have to take a step back,\u201d said Mariners manager Scott Servais, whose team entered the weekend 66-93. \u201cThe disparity in the game between the top and the bottom, it\u2019s real. There\u2019s no question about it. Is it good for the game? I don\u2019t know. I do know that there are a lot of really smart people that work in front offices and ownership groups and they do realize that sometimes you do need to pull back, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and I\u2019m all in because I think it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\nHouston (104 wins), the Los Angeles Dodgers (103) and New York Yankees (102) all broke the century mark with time to spare, and Minnesota (99) and Atlanta had a chance to join them. It\u2019s the third consecutive year three teams have reached 100 - before this run it occurred only in 1942, 1977, 1998, 2002 and 2003.\n\nDetroit (112), Baltimore (107), Miami (103) and Kansas City (101) gave baseball four 100-loss teams for the first time since 2002. One-sided season series included Houston going 18-1 against Seattle and the Yankees 17-1 vs. Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWhether a team loses 95 or loses 100, I just don\u2019t see that as a relevant issue,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cI think the more important point is that we have different clubs from all sorts of market sizes that are successful.\u201d\n\nPlayers are upset that many teams failed to pursue free agents the last two offseasons, executives concentrating two-to-five years into the future rather than trying to win now.\n\n\u201cEach free agent market is a little bit different, but what we have seen that seems to be consistent over these last two markets is this all-in and all-out mentality,\u201d Clark said.\n\nStill, spending and success are not completely linked.\n\nTampa Bay, last in payroll at $66 million, has a chance to make the playoffs along with Oakland, 25th at $95 million. Three of the six highest payrolls failed to reach the postseason: No. 1 Boston ($228 million), the No. 3 Chicago Cubs ($217 million) and No. 6 San Francisco ($181 million).\n\nThroughout the game, the increase in home runs and strikeouts has been a constant. The 6,647 home runs through Thursday were up 19% from last year and well above the previous record of 6,105 in 2017. About half the clubs are on track to establish team records, led by Minnesota (301) and the Yankees (299), who set the previous big league mark of 267 last year.\n\nAlready 128 players have hit 20 or more homers, 11 more than the old high set in 2017, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Among that group, 55 have reached 30 to better the record of 47 that had stood since 2000.\n\nAnd 23 pitchers have 200 or more strikeouts, topping the post-1900 record of 18 in both 2015 and last year, Elias said.\n\nBaseball\u2019s efforts to quicken the pace of games have not resulted in swifter play: the average time of a nine-inning game is 3:05:35, up from 3:00:44 last year and 3:05:11 in 2017.\n\nMLB and players have agreed to cut the active roster size from Sept. 1 on from 40 to 28 and increase the maximum from 25 to 26 from opening day through Aug. 31, which should cut down on late-season pitching changes. Management has not decided whether to exercise its right to install pitch clocks and a three-batter minimum for next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a final answer once I have a chance to review the issue with ownership in November,\u201d Manfred said.\n\nOn-field rules are part of collective bargaining. The sides agreed last winter to an early start to negotiations for a labor deal to replace the agreement that expires in December 2021. But there have been just three negotiating meetings, one of them a preliminary session, and the labor rules will remain unchanged this offseason.\n\n\u201cWe made a deal in 2016. We\u2019re good,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cThe union\u2019s got to decide what it is they want us to consider. When they\u2019re ready to do that, I\u2019m sure they will make a proposal.\u201d\n\nSaid Clark: \u201cWe have had conversations. We anticipate those conversations continuing and at the point in time that they lend themselves to proposals from both sides, then we\u2019ll do so.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Major League Baseball has entered the Boom/Bust Era.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/astros_angels_baseball_83835_c0-136-3238-2023_s1770x1032.jpg?d1f54729dfb36fffc8e0275ebaaa8af920d5063f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
