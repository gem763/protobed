But I'm happy to be here and stay in Leverkusen for another year. We'll see what will happens next summer.\"\n\nArsenal , Man City and Real Madrid are among the list of other clubs monitoring the wingers progress.\n\nSpeaking on his possible options in the summer, Havertz told Bild: \"I really don't know yet whether Bayern is the next and right step for me.\n\n\"I also don't know whether foreign countries would not be more suitable for me. I really don't think too much about it at the moment.\"\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nRegardless of who declares an interest in Havertz, manager Bosz is resigned to losing his young talent.\n\n\"Of course I would like to keep him, just as I would have liked to keep Julian Brandt, for example,\" Bosz told Sport Bild . \"Kai is only 20 and still has room for improvement. I can help him there.\n\n\"But it is like this, at the end the player himself must feel when he is ready for the next step.\n\n\"Nobody can decide that for him.\"", "description": "The 20-year-old set the Bundesliga alight last season and made the rest of Europe sit up and take notice", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Sipa Usa Pa Images", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20637965.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Estonia-v-Germany-UEFA-Euro-2020-Qualifier.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
