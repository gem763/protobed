People about 50 miles to the north in Marsh Harbor weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\n\u201cThe affected areas look like a nuclear bomb was dropped on the place,\u201d said Sandy Point resident Vaughn Rolle, whose house was only slightly damaged. \u201cWe drove up (to Marsh Harbor) day before yesterday, 10 minutes in I had to get away. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. It\u2019s unbelievable. I never imagined a hurricane can do that type of damage.\u201d\n\nThe island of Great Abaco has no power and a fuel shortage has slowed relief and recovery efforts.\n\nHowever, aid continues to pour in Saturday and the attitude of residents continues to be positive.\n\n\u201cEverybody is trying to help everyone else,\u201d said Sandy Point resident Gerard Lightbourn. \u201cThat\u2019s all we can do. To see people reaching out touches your heart. We appreciate it.\u201d\n\n'Paradise has been turned to hell': Residents, aid workers in Bahamas deal with Dorian devastation\n\nA small paved runway near Sandy Point is the busiest place on the island. Private jets continually fly in, drop off aid and fly out.\n\nOne such group came Saturday from Florida, delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies collected from residents eager to help. Roughly 75 volunteers converged on Orlando Melbourne International Airport prior to the flights to sort the supplies that were loaded onto five planes.\n\n\u201cOne of our troop mothers made a direct call to the prime minister\u2019s office to get an idea of what they need,\u201d said Bart LaGrone of Scout Troop 323. \u201cWe sorted all the items so the most critical things get to the island first. That\u2019s mostly medical supplies, water and food.\u201d\n\nState Rep Randy Fine was on one of two planes from Melbourne that flew into Sandy Point.\n\n\u201cThe response has been nothing short of remarkable,\u201d Fine said. \u201cWe have collected over 100,000 pounds of supplies. It\u2019s amazing and it says a lot about our community.\u201d\n\nHurricane Dorian has wreaked havoc: Here's how you can help.\n\nFlorida Tech provided a Piper Navajo and pilots that carried Fine and two members of the media to the Bahamas. The other plane that went to Sandy Point was the Tico Belle, a World War II Douglas C-47 Skytrain that dropped Allied paratroopers over France on D-Day.\n\nThe vintage plane, supplied by the Valiant Air Command in Titusville, carried 3,500 pounds of aid.\n\nThe airstrip on Grand Abaco has a small clearing where supplies are offloaded. Roughly 40 cars line a parking area nearby. Locals say the cars are abandoned. People drive to the air strip, board a plane to depart and leave their cars. Remaining fuel has been siphoned from those vehicles.\n\nThose who are lucky enough get out while others wait.\n\nShivalo Roberts, who moved to West Palm Beach about 18 months ago, is a Grand Abaco native whose shipping business in Marsh Harbor, R.S.P. Services, was destroyed.\n\n\u201cI have no more business here,\u201d he said. \u201cI arrived Thursday and we\u2019re waiting to get out. The business is totaled.\u201d\n\nWhile access to the island was limited, nature\u2019s force could be seen in one beachside house in Sandy Point where rooms were exposed to the ocean. The roof was gone and everything inside ruined. Its residents were still in the house, grateful to be alive.\n\nOutside the house a boat was flipped on top of a car. Other boats were smashed into the shore. Large palm trees had been uprooted and dumped on their side.\n\nAnd this was the part of the island that didn't get hit as bad.\n\nOnce the TiCo Belle and the Navajo were offloaded, the group headed back to Florida to reload to take back more supplies.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Florida Today: Hurricane Dorian: Vintage plane helps fly aid to Grand Abaco, Bahamas", "description": "The island of Great Abaco in the Bahamas has no power and a fuel shortage has slowed relief and recovery efforts.
