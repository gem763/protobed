There was an appreciation of our involvement in that particular operation, which I remind everyone is about freedom of navigation in the Straits of Hormuz,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what that is about. The other matters that are being pursued by the United States are matters that they\u2019re pursuing, and I made it very clear when we announced our involvement in [the Strait of Hormuz] that it was very much about that freedom of navigation issue and that\u2019s what it is about and that\u2019s appreciated.\u201d\n\nMorrison said he had discussed arrangements for the freedom of navigation exercise with the US defence secretary, Mark Esper during his meetings with members of the Trump cabinet on Friday Washington time.\n\nMorrison praised Trump\u2019s restraint on Iran. \u201cI made a point of commending the president yesterday on what I understand to be his natural instinct of restraint on these matters and he said that I think fairly plainly yesterday in the Oval Office I think there is an instinct towards restraint from the president and I commended him for that, and it was good to have the opportunity to confirm that again in the course of our discussions.\n\n\u201cI mean Australia will make its decisions in our national interest. I said at the press conference yesterday that where we\u2019ve worked together it\u2019s because we have shared objectives,\u201d the prime minister said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because [America] asks us to do this, or we ask them to do that, it\u2019s because we share objectives and where those objectives are shared then you can expect an alignment of activities and operations.\u201d\n\nScott Morrison scrambles to contain political mushroom cloud after Trump raises nuclear option with Iran | Katharine Murphy Read more\n\nMorrison said people needed to avoid \u201cgetting ahead of themselves\u201d about what Trump might or might not do in relation to Iran. He said these issues were \u201cdealt with I think in a very iterative way and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing\u201d.\n\nTrump told reporters during his meeting with Morrison that he could launch a military strike on Iran \u201cright here\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all set to go. I could do it right here and then you\u2019d have a nice big story to report,\u201d the president declared. But moments later he suggested holding off was the better course of action. \u201cI think the strong person\u2019s approach, and the thing that does show strength, would be showing a little bit of restraint.\u201d\n\nMorrison wound up his Washington program on Saturday local time with a $150m commitment to support Nasa in launching expeditions to the moon and to Mars, and with a visit to a centre helping veterans to become entrepreneurs. He then attended a soiree at the ambassadorial residence with Trump administration officials and Australian business figures including Gina Rinehart, Anthony Pratt and Kerry Stokes.\n\nMorrison will travel with Trump to Ohio on Sunday local time to open a box factory owned by Pratt, the Australian billionaire box maker.
