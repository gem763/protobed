The first was installed at the Anchorage Fire Department.\n\nFormer fire respondent Chris Northcut volunteered to have the second monitoring device placed on the roof of his home just east of Anchorage, officials said. Integrated Robotics Imaging Systems President John Parker installed the cameras at no cost to the city as part of the pilot system. Forester John See oversaw the installation.\n\nThe system was designed to detect \u201cpersistent heat sources, heat sources that grow over time, moving heat sources and heat sources that have the common elements of a fire,\u201d Parker said.\n\nIf the pilot system works as planned, it will be able to show exactly where the fire is, officials said. Firefighters have had a hard time locating fires, because the people who call in to report smoke rising from the forest cannot pinpoint a location.\n\nWildfires north and south of Anchorage have recently burned dozens of square miles and over 50 homes.\n\nThe Eyak Corporation, the village corporation for Cordova, is helping fund the pilot project in hopes that it could ultimately be used for wildfire detection in rural Alaska, Parker said.\n\nDuring the testing phase, the cameras are expected to monitor the western part of Far North Bicentennial Park just outside the city, officials said. If anything suspicious is detected, a green signal will be sent to the fire department. The signal will turn red if it is actually a fire, accompanied with an alarm and GPS location.\n\nTesting is scheduled for this fall, officials said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thermo-sensing cameras were installed in Alaska to help the fire department locate, analyze and monitor wildfires, officials said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
