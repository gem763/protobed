Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Sunday denounced President Donald Trump\u2019s decision earlier this month to publicly urge China to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary race.\n\nAsked during an interview Sunday with CBS\u2019 \u201cFace The Nation\u201d whether he believes it\u2019s appropriate for Trump to ask China to open such a probe, Cruz stammered for a few moments before saying \u201cof course not.\u201d\n\n\u201cElections in the U.S. should be decided by Americans and it\u2019s not the business of foreign countries \u2015 any foreign countries \u2015 to be interfering in our elections,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump drew heated backlash from Democrats and some Republicans on Oct. 3 when he told reporters on the White House lawn that China \u201cshould start an investigation into the Bidens\u201d while discussing trade talks with the country.\n\nHis comments echoed remarks he made to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during a July phone call in which he urged the foreign leader to look into Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe call became the subject of a subsequent whistleblower complaint filed by a U.S. intelligence official and later the centerpiece of the House\u2019s ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s Republican defenders have claimed the president was only joking when he encouraged China to investigate the Bidens. But one of Trump\u2019s China advisers, Michael Pillsbury, told the Financial Times that he received \u201cquite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese\u201d following Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nCBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan continued to press Cruz on Sunday, asking whether it had been appropriate for Trump to ask Ukraine to get involved.\n\n\u201cDo you think that, say, the president\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s been talking about China, who\u2019s been talking about Ukraine, do you want to hear him testify about this sort of shadow foreign policy?\u201d she asked.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said last week that he wants Giuliani, who has been urging foreign officials to investigate the Bidens at the behest of Trump, to testify before his committee.\n\n\u201cListen, foreign countries should stay out of American elections,\u201d Cruz, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Brennan. \u201cThat\u2019s true for Russia, that\u2019s true for Ukraine, that\u2019s true for China \u2015 that\u2019s true for all of them. It should be the American people deciding elections.\u201d\n\nHe added that it would \u201cmake a lot of sense\u201d for Giuliani to testify.\n\nWatch Cruz\u2019s full interview with \u201cFace The Nation\u201d below. His comments about Trump\u2019s request to the Chinese begin around the 4:30 mark.", "description": "\"Foreign countries should stay out of American elections,\" the Republican senator said.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da36ebd2100002b0b344ac6.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
