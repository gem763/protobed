Within a week, he pleaded no contest in court to two attempted larceny charges and was sentenced to 30 days in jail.\n\n\u201cI truly believe this is the Neighborhood Watch of 2020,\u201d said Livonia Police Capt. Ronald Taig, whose force was one of the first law enforcement agencies in Michigan \u2014 and is one of more than 400 across the country \u2014 to partner with the Ring Neighbors app, owned by Amazon.\n\nRecognizing the growing proliferation of home security cameras \u2014 in doorbells, on floodlights and porches and at back doors \u2014 many law enforcement agencies are jumping on the latest tech bandwagon to spot possible crime trends, share safety information and request videos from app users in an effort to stave off and solve crimes.\n\nApple recall: Aldi, Kroger recall apples due to possible Listeria contamination\n\nPotential smartwatch deal: Google parent Alphabet reportedly has made an offer to buy Fitbit\n\nBut Amazon's Ring app (and others like it) and the idea of law enforcement joining the \u201creal-time crime and safety alerts\u201d community is raising concerns about privacy, profiling, less than transparent public-private partnerships and what critics see is another step closer to a Big Brother police state.\n\nAmong the worries of some critics is video captured by Ring and other security systems being stored online by Amazon and other companies, adding to the mass of personal information being collected from all of us.\n\nRing's doorbell camera footage shows 60-year-old Jeffrey Couch rummaging through a pickup parked in a driveway.

A centrally-connected alarm system beyond property and on driveways and streets into Amazon\u2019s cloud, that\u2019s different than on your property or door,\u201d said Chris Gilliard, a professor at Macomb Community College in Warren, Mich.\n\nGilliard has been critical of Amazon and Ring, but is aware of some of the advantages of assistance to police.\n\n\u201cPart of where my concern starts is the secretive way this all came about. Amazon did not (initially) tell the number of police across the country they\u2019ve partnered with. That\u2019s no way a public service should operate,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month, more than 30 civil rights groups in the U.S. signed a letter with concerns, saying the police partnerships \"exemplify the company's willingness to do what it takes to expand their data empire ... Amazon Ring partnerships with police departments threaten civil liberties, privacy and civil rights, and exist without oversight or accountability.\"\n\nIn the letter, the groups claim the partnerships \"pose a serious threat to civil rights and liberties, especially for black and brown communities already targeted and surveilled by law enforcement.\"\n\nRing disputes many of the claims in the letter, saying its mission is to help make neighborhoods safer, including the free app tool that connects communities and their local law enforcement agencies.\n\n\"We have taken care to design these features in a way that keeps users in control and protects their privacy. The Neighbors app has strict community guidelines, trained moderators, user flagging capabilities and other tools in place to create a safe place for all members of the community to talk about what\u2019s happening in their neighborhoods,\u201d Ring said in a statement.\n\n\"All content submitted to our app is reviewed to ensure that it adheres to our community guidelines, including our policies against racial profiling and prohibiting hate speech or other forms of prejudice before it goes live on the platform. We take this very seriously and have invested many resources, tools, and human power to ensure we uphold a standard of trust and civility,\" the statement said.\n\nMichael Siegel of Detroit is a proponent, having multiple Ring cameras at his west-side home. He bought them \"to give me peace of mind\" and for \"deterrence.\"\n\nHis cameras caught a man who came up his driveway and checked out his vehicle. He said the man looked right at a camera and stared at it.\n\n\"It was amazing that he didn't care,\" Siegel said, but added that he believes the cameras are helpful and beneficial.\n\nSiegel said he doesn't have concerns about the police partnership, saying his only issue would be \"if they had the ability to tap into your home private network.\"\n\n'We all wanna live in Mayberry, but we don't'\n\nMore than 400 law enforcement agencies across the country have joined the app as partners, including about 20 in Michigan \u2014 all in the Lower Peninsula \u2014 from Kentwood and Kalamazoo to Grand Blanc and St. Clair.\n\nIn August, Ring released a map showing law enforcement partners across the country. The map appears to be updated, with more than a dozen of Michigan's police partners in metro Detroit including Livonia, Ferndale, Troy, Auburn Hills and Clinton Township. Others police departments, such as Birmingham and Sterling Heights, have discussed using the app or are making further inquiries about it.\n\nGilliard said he wasn't aware of any law enforcement agencies across the country that have said no to participating, but a few haven't said yes \u2014 yet.\n\nRing launched the Neighbors app in May 2018, and anyone can download and use it, whether or not they have a security system. Law enforcement can join, too, and view comments or video that users post inside and outside their jurisdiction.\n\nCaptain Ronald Taig of the Livonia (Mich.) Police Department at his desk with the Ring Neighborhood app on his computer screen on Tuesday, October 1, 2019. (Photo: Eric Seals, Eric Seals/Detroit Free Press)\n\nA look earlier this month at what Taig saw in Livonia showed a video that indicated an unknown man backed into someone's driveway, then went into the yard for an unknown reason and was talking on a cellphone. More than a dozen other situations in the city posted by users were listed as \"suspicious,\" \"unknown visitor\" and \"crime.\"\n\nUsers are identified as Neighbor No., not with a name or exact address. Law enforcement can post alerts and submit video requests to users in their jurisdiction.\n\nLaw enforcement goes through Ring to make a video request and must reference a relevant case and videos within a limited time and area. Ring doesn't provide information about users unless a user chooses to share video with police. Then, the user's email and address are disclosed.\n\nUsers can say no and opt out of future requests. Police said they don't have direct access to a user's cameras or system.\n\nThe Free Press couldn't find any examples of law enforcement using a warrant to obtain video from this partnership, but would likely have the legal right to do so. Authorities can use warrants, for example, to obtain cellphone records, other types of videos and to search computers.\n\nCNET, an online news site covering tech, culture and science, had an article in June that discussed a post by Houston Police and a Ring doorbell camera giveaway that the department posted on NextDoor, another social network for neighborhoods. Among the requirements to win a free Ring doorbell camera, were signing up for the Ring video recording plan for $30 a year or $3 a month and allowing \"HPD to access the cameras when a crime occurs when we request it.\"\n\nAccording to the CNET article, \"Ring said that it doesn't support this model and that it was reaching out to police partners to make sure this wasn't a requirement for Ring giveaways.\"\n\nLivonia Police was giving away Ring doorbell cameras monthly while supplies lasted. Some other departments in the region said they do not participate in such giveaways.\n\nThe Free Press asked Ring that, if deemed necessary, can law enforcement obtain video they believe Ring may have from an user for an investigation.\n\n\"Ring will not disclose user videos to law enforcement unless the user expressly consents or if disclosure is required by law, such as to comply with a warrant,\" Ring said in a statement. \"Ring objects to overbroad or otherwise inappropriate legal demands as a matter of course.\"\n\nHow other departments use Ring app\n\nThe Detroit Police Department is listed on the map. It signed an agreement, which was executed in May, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean the officers have the authority to use it.\u201d Deputy Chief Grant Ha said.\n\nHa said while some people have been trained on how to use the app, the department is developing policies and standard operating procedures. Ha said once the policies and procedures have been completed, possibly this year, they will have to be reviewed by himself, the chief and the Board of Police Commissioners.\n\nHa said the app may be used for serious crimes, such as murder and arson, and may be restricted to those who work in certain units or bureaus, such as homicide. He said it could bring \u201can additional investigative tool to communicate with the neighbors on crimes and safety, put a finger on it in real time.\u201d\n\nAmazon Ring: Doorbell cameras attract congressional concern over police partnerships\n\nPCs through the years: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\nWhen asked whether an image on a video obtained through the app may be tied into facial recognition technology, Ha said it would depend on whether there is a clear enough image on whatever video is posted if that still shot could be taken for facial recognition analysis.\n\nHe said it would be no different than seeing something on Facebook \u2013 if it\u2019s a particular crime and the image is of a good enough resolution \u2013 to analyze.\n\n\u201cIt not the investigative tool, but an investigative tool,\u201d Ha said.\n\nFerndale (Mich.) Policestarting using the app in mid-September and put out a request for information about a rash of larcenies from several dozen unlocked vehicles. The department received a few responses, but none proved fruitful, Sgt. Baron Brown said.\n\nBut, one time, it may. \u201cWe get the environment in which we operate. We\u2019re very careful to live up to the expectations of our community,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe are not gonna use it willy-nilly in a Big Brother aspect. We\u2019re really gonna use it carefully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get people are worried and I understand that, and we operate kinda keeping them in mind,\" he said. \"But we need to use modern technology to do our job.\u201d\n\nBrown said only he, the detective lieutenant and the captain are allowed to use the app and only in the \u201cmost serious situation.\u201d\n\nOne example, had it been available then to Ferndale Police, was the disappearance and murder of Ferndale mom Lily Camara in July. Police could have asked users to check for video in that unsolved case. Perhaps it would have garnered video of Camara leaving her house and with whom, if she returned, a vehicle description \u2013 even her demeanor.\n\nData entry: Wisconsin workers embedded with microchips\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know, that\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s why we\u2019re using this technology,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt might have given us this type of information. It might give us more information to prevent something like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all wanna live in Mayberry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTroy (Mich.) Police Sgt. Meghan Lehman said the department is using the app, but \u201cnot very aggressively.\"\n\n\"This is just another tool for us,\" she said. \"Like we use social media, but it\u2019s a very specific group.\u201d\n\nLehman said the department requested video footage related to a home invasion after a person broke into a house at night, touched a sleeping female resident, walked around the house and left. It put out a message to all residents in that particular neighborhood who are on the Neighbors app, she said, but it had not led to an arrest.\n\nOnly a handful of people within Troy Police can use the app, Lehman said.\n\n\u201cI totally understand people\u2019s concerns\u201d over the Big Brother fears, Lehman said. She also understands what is considered \u201cone person\u2019s suspicious (person) could be another person\u2019s meter reader.\u201d\n\nNeighbors is a safety social media app that allows users to view and share posts, videos, and photos of suspicious activity. The app is free on iOS and Android. (Photo: Ring)\n\nLehman said a con of the app is that people could misunderstand police are actively monitoring this, \u201cwhich we\u2019re not. If we were monitoring people\u2019s cameras and had access to people\u2019s cameras that would be different.\u201d\n\nAmazon free food delivery: The service for Prime members has a catch.\n\nAt the Livonia Police Department, Taig said, the partnership has been \u201cnothing but successful for us,\u201d leading to multiple arrests from people sharing video, such as of people stealing packages. He and two command officers running the detective bureau check and post on the app.\n\nTaig said he likes to interact with app users, and he doesn\u2019t believe it feeds into the idea of people thinking there's more crime in a community than is actually occurring, as some critics have charged. He said no one is forced to buy and use such cameras.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, as far as I look at it, if I\u2019m a crime victim, there\u2019s at least a chance to get this person because we have them on video,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not for everybody.\u201d\n\n'There is a big brother aspect to it'\n\nPeter Henning, a former federal prosecutor and professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, said Ring \u201cplays on people\u2019s fears about home security and so partnering with the police is smart for them. It sends a message we\u2019re here to help, and certainly for the police, anytime they can get video, it\u2019s helpful to them.\u201d\n\nHenning said most citizens will want to provide video because they want to help the police.\n\nThe pro for law enforcement is they get access to real-time evidence, he said, \u201cand that\u2019s the greatest benefit to them. They can use that to identify a potential suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe con,\u201d Henning said, \u201cis that there\u2019s a certain loss of privacy (for the homeowner). I don\u2019t have to provide it to the police, but if I choose to, I could be called to testify at a trial. This is evidence. But in court, it has to be verified. \u2026 That could involve individuals in the criminal process much more than they might have ever expected.\u201d\n\nHenning added: \u201cThere is a Big Brother aspect to it. Do we want everything out there? And do I want to get caught up in a case?\u201d\n\nHe said that police cannot demand the video \u2014 unless they have a warrant.\n\nBut the 30-plus groups critical of the partnership believe Amazon's technology creates \"a seamless and easily automated experience for police to request and access footage without a warrant, and then store it indefinitely,\" according to their letter.\n\nThe Ring doorbell sold at Prudential Alarm by Security System Specialist Rachel Murray, at her office in Oak Park, Mich. on Tuesday, Aug, 21, 2018.n (Photo: Kimberly P. Mitchell, Detroit Free Press)\n\nThey state that they believe the footage could be used by law enforcement to conduct facial recognition searches, target protesters exercising their First Amendment rights or share with other agencies, such as ICE or the FBI. They are calling on mayors and city councils to require police to cancel existing partnerships and pass surveillance oversight ordinances.\n\nThe groups also claim that Amazon scripts what authorities say and coaches police on talking points to get users to hand over footage.\n\nRing, in a statement, said this is inaccurate; and that it does not script what law enforcement says.\n\n\"We provide them with materials and information about our products and services to help ensure they are accurately represented to the public, but we do not require them to use that information,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"Ring also does not require or force police to promote our products, nor do we dictate what police should say regarding Ring and Neighbors app. The claim that we coach police in order to get customers to hand over their footage is false. Customers choose whether or not they want to share footage\" it states.\n\nCyberspace milestone: The first online message was sent 50 years ago. How has the internet evolved since then?\n\nSamer Naim Jadallah, an attorney who represented Couch in the Livonia case, said once suspects are presented with any video footage of them committing a crime \u201cthey become speechless and want to resolve the matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said, attorneys have also used camera footage to exonerate people, too.\n\nJadallah said that he has found that citizens in the region are volunteering if they have video and saw something that might be helpful to police. He said he can see the app being a useful resource to help police.\n\nIn his experience, he said, very seldom have police harassed a neighbor for video.\n\nJadallah said of the 20 houses on his block in Dearborn, more than half have security camera systems.\n\nHe said he could see problems if cameras capture a moment without context. For example, a couple wrestling for fun and caught on a neighbor's camera, and police being called to the home for domestic violence.\n\n\u201cI tell all my clients, we are in a world right now, there is a potential of being watched 24 hours a day,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes when you think you're in the privacy of your property, you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nContact Christina Hall: chall@freepress.com.
