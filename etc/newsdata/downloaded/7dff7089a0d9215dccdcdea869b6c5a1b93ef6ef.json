He was 70.\n\nHis family announced the death, according to the Associated Press. Mr. Money underwent heart valve surgery in the spring, canceled concert dates because of pneumonia and announced in August that he had Stage 4 esophageal cancer.\n\nA singer-songwriter who also played the saxophone, keyboard and harmonica, he specialized in a polished, upbeat brand of blue-collar rock \u2014 notably in \u201cTake Me Home Tonight\u201d (1986), which featured former Ronettes vocalist Ronnie Spector singing \u201cbe my little baby\u201d during the chorus, in a nod to her 1963 hit \u201cBe My Baby.\u201d\n\nThe single revitalized Spector\u2019s singing career, earned a Grammy nomination and became Mr. Money\u2019s biggest commercial success, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard charts despite his early skepticism that the song would be a dud. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t have Ronnie on the tune, I never would have done it,\u201d he told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nIts popularity capped a remarkable decade-long run for Mr. Money, a Long Island rocker who was plucked from obscurity by rock impresario Bill Graham; opened for Santana, the Rolling Stones and the Who after releasing his first album; nearly crippled himself from a drug overdose; and recovered in the early 1980s to become a shaggy-haired fixture of the newly created television channel MTV.\n\n\u201cEver since I was young I\u2019d sing in my home / Those crazy songs I heard on the radio,\u201d he declared in \u201cWanna Be a Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Star,\u201d from his 1977 self-titled debut. He wanted \u201ca mansion on the hill\u201d and \u201cthousand dollar bills\u201d to burn, he said, and to some degree he got it \u2014 certified platinum records, if not wheelbarrows of cash, and a devoted following that persisted into recent years, when he continued touring and starred with his family in an AXS reality series called \u201cReal Money.\u201d\n\nLabeled \u201crock\u2019s Rodney Dangerfield\u201d by Rolling Stone, Mr. Money spouted profane one-liners and dad jokes in interviews; spoofed himself in a 2012 Geico ad, as a travel agent who sings \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d; and acquired a reputation as a slightly spastic performer and reckless wild man offstage. \u201cI got so high in the \u201970s and \u201980s, my whole life is still an acid flashback,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 1996. \u201cI get up in the morning, smoke a cigarette and see paisley.\u201d\n\nMr. Money had initially pursued a far more conventional lifestyle, following his father and grandfather into the New York Police Department. He worked for two years as a clerk and typist, but in 1968 he either quit or was fired \u2014 he told both versions of the story, invariably citing his desire to grow out his hair \u2014 and moved to Berkeley, Calif.\n\nImmersing himself in the region\u2019s burgeoning rock scene, he studied with Judy Davis, the vocal coach of Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand, and performed with local groups. He supported himself by selling bell-bottom blue jeans and, perennially broke, adopted a tongue-in-cheek stage name, dropping a few letters from his surname, Mahoney, to become Eddie Money.\n\nMr. Money said he linked up with Graham after playing in a battle of the bands contest at the rock promoter\u2019s Winterland Ballroom venue in San Francisco. With Graham\u2019s help, he signed a contract with Columbia Records, resulting in a studio debut that most critics panned. \u201cLive inspection reveals that the sleek stud on the cover (and in the ads) is as pudgy and sloppy as his voice,\u201d wrote Robert Christgau of the Village Voice.\n\nNonetheless, the album spawned two Top 40 singles, \u201cBaby Hold On\u201d and \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise,\u201d and featured an acclaimed backing band that included guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Lyon, saxophonist Tom Scott and a pair of Steve Miller Band veterans, bassist Lonnie Turner and drummer Gary Mallaber.\n\nMr. Money found mixed success with a pair of follow-up records and had completed a tour for \u201cPlaying for Keeps\u201d (1980) when he snorted a barbiturate, phenobarbital, apparently believing it was cocaine. Amid a night of heavy drinking, he \u201cwent into a semi-catatonic state,\u201d he said, damaging his kidneys and the sciatic nerve in his left leg. He was unable to walk for nearly a year.\n\n\u201cEddie Mahoney didn\u2019t do this to himself, Eddie Money did this to Eddie Mahoney,\u201d he told Rolling Stone while still recovering. \u201cThe big rock star with the Mercedes and the half a million dollars in the bank almost ruined what I really am. It took me a lot of years and a lot of work to get what I wanted, but it took Eddie Money only a couple of days to almost throw it away.\u201d\n\nHis follow-up, \u201cNo Control\u201d (1982), invigorated his career and launched him to prominence on MTV with videos for two songs: \u201cThink I\u2019m in Love,\u201d a spoof on black-and-white Dracula movies that concluded with Mr. Money being bitten by a vampire; and \u201cShakin,\u2019 \u201d which starred actress and singer Apollonia Kotero (later featured in Prince\u2019s film \u201cPurple Rain\u201d) as the driver of a bouncing Chevy Malibu.\n\nInto the early 1990s, Mr. Money recorded hits such as \u201cI Wanna Go Back,\u201d \u201cPeace in Our Time\u201d (originally released by Jennifer Holliday), \u201cI\u2019ll Get By,\u201d \u201cEndless Nights\u201d and \u201cWalk on Water,\u201d which peaked at No. 9 on the charts. For many listeners, however, he was most closely identified with \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise,\u201d an anthem that he described as a fantasy.\n\n\u201cI was going with a girl and her mother didn\u2019t like me because I was, you know, a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll wannabe,\u201d he told the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call in 2014. \u201cShe used to go home on the weekends, and I would never see her. I wrote \u2018Two Tickets to Paradise\u2019 about having no money. I had a ticket for a bus ride to California \u2014 I was going to take a little bus ride. But she dumped me anyway.\u201d\n\nEdward Joseph Mahoney was born in Brooklyn on March 21, 1949, and raised in the planned community of Levittown, N.Y. Partly to score dates with cheerleaders, he began performing in rock groups as a teenager, playing with a band called the Grapes of Wrath. His father disapproved, tearing Jimi Hendrix posters from his bedroom walls.\n\nMr. Money married Laurie Harris in 1989 and had five children. Several performed with him in recent years, after the release of albums such as \u201cWanna Go Back\u201d (2007). A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nInspired by the Four Seasons musical \u201cJersey Boys,\u201d Mr. Money wrote an autobiographical musical \u2014 naturally, it was titled \u201cTwo Tickets to Paradise\u201d \u2014 that chronicled his rise to fame and premiered in 2009 on Long Island. By then, he said, he had settled into a more low-key lifestyle, taming his excesses to focus on his family.\n\n\u201cEddie Money is just a figment of your imagination,\u201d he told the New York Times . \u201cWe let him out for an hour and a half at a time.\u201d", "description": "He was a police trainee before turning to rock music, and reached No. 4 on the charts with \u201cTake Me Home Tonight,\u201d a collaboration with Ronnie Spector.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ViUxxcTxyTBk5yOEaYgUmkOzTTY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JGKMHEGWGQI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
