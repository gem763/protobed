I ask him what she should do, but amid all of this chaos, he doesn\u2019t have an immediate answer.\n\nThe ISIS wife continues: \u201cI like how America thinks it\u2019s too dangerous for them [the U.S. military] to be here but safe for us to remain with Assad.\"\n\nOver the past two years I\u2019ve been in and out of the northeastern territory of Syria held by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) six times with staff from the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE). We have conducted in-depth interviews with 217 ISIS men and women, 100 of them in SDF held territory, for our project countering the ISIS brand, which the SDF has supported fully.\n\nThe woman texting me today gave us an interview last year and has managed to stay in touch via illicit phones other detainees allow her to use.\n\nAt the same time she is texting me, our Kurdish translator texts that they are living under the sound of bombs and troops advancing. Assad\u2019s troops are marching eastward, while Turkey is barreling in from the north. Which soldiers will reach Camp Roj first and what the women should do if the Kurdish YPJ-Women\u2019s Protection Units guarding them decide it\u2019s too dangerous to remain in place, is something the guards have told the inmates to think about.\n\nThe female inmates of Camp Ain Issa, farther west, faced a similar dilemma earlier in the week when the Turks began shelling. Until Sunday, Ain Issa Camp housed a total of 12,000 women and children, but according to one Belgian woman, it descended into \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d as fires broke out, the guards left, and the women escaped in the hundreds.\n\nAmong the women housed there, 265 were wives of foreigner terrorist fighters, alongside 1,000 of their children. On the second day of the Turkish air assault, Belgian ISIS wives Bouchra Abouallal and Tatiana Wielandt decided it was better to go on the run with their small children than remain in place to learn what next disaster might befall them.\n\n\u201c We don\u2019t want to keep running away. We want to be tried. \u201d \u2014 Text message from Western wife of ISIS fighter\n\nWe interviewed Bouchra Abouallal in September 2019. Completely exhausted from her experience with ISIS, she said that life inside the Caliphate was \u201cthe best possible deradicalization program ever.\u201d Already prosecuted in absentia and facing a five-year sentence in her home country of Belgium, she told ICSVE researchers she would prefer to return home even to serve a 20-year sentence rather than remain in the camp under the menace of the cruel ISIS-inmate enforcers who threatened all European women who no longer wanted anything to do with the ISIS Caliphate.\n\nNow Bouchra Abouallal is on the run with her three small children. In audio messages punctuated in the background by shelling she told Belgian journalist Bruno Struys that she was headed toward the front lines in hopes she could make it to safety in Turkey, where she wishes to turn herself into the Belgian consulate and make her way home.\n\nWhile European officials here in Brussels have stated that Turkey agrees to help any escaped ISIS cadres that end in their hands to be returned to their homelands, up until recently, Belgium was refusing to let her come back. Instead of seeing her as someone victimized by the Islamic State\u2019s propaganda and lies, and fooled by the \u201cShariah for Belgium\u201d group that had radicalized many in her native city of Antwerp, Belgian politicians see her as a threat.\n\nBut it is not difficult for Belgian authorities to turn past posts on her social media accounts against her.\n\n\u201cYour system has failed oh Belgian state,\u201d Bouchra\u2019s Facebook page read after she slipped out of Belgium to go live under the Islamic State. Referring to the way the Belgian police had hassled her upon her first return home from Syria, her posts taunted them, saying \u201cYou were watching us 24/7 and you still haven't managed to stop us. Why? Because Allah is the best planner (...)\u201d Her threats continued with, \u201cWe have left because we believe that it is a duty for every Muslim. To the policeman who threatened to take our children away, I can say that my children will turn yours into orphans, with the will of Allah.\u201d\n\nBouchra claims that it wasn\u2019t she, but one of her ISIS husbands, who authored these hate-filled posts. She says he used to lock her up at home and post on her Facebook page without her permission. Indeed, when we interviewed Bouchra in September she spoke gently as she denounced ISIS, giving us permission to use both her image and her name in a counter narrative video\u2014this, while knowing the ISIS enforcers in the camp would likely punish her for it.\n\nThe woman texting me today from Camp Roj does so fearing that if it becomes known it was her texting she will be punished by her YPJ guards. Yet pure terror drives her to try to stay connected with the outside world as she makes wrenching decisions for herself and her young child.\n\nAmericans are also in this camp. We have interviewed two American passport holders\u2014Canadian dual-citizen Kimberly Pullman and disputed American citizen Hoda Muthana.\n\nWhen I ask today\u2019s texter about Americans in the camps, she tells me there are five in all, two more in Camp Roj and another in Camp Hol. She states that there are also two American children in Camp Roj. We\u2019ve met one of them, Adam, the two-year-old son of Hoda Muthana. Both times we interviewed his mother, Adam was struggling with chronic bronchitis. Today the woman texting me from Camp Roj tells me that the air is thick with fumes from the bombings, which is causing many of the children to have breathing difficulties.\n\n\u201cGoing to jail right now won\u2019t be great,\u201d this woman writes as she imagines her future in the West\u2014if she can ever manage to get home. Then she envisions another future: \u201cI could get lost among all of this trouble.\u201d Then again she realizes that fleeing the camp, if her guards do abandon their posts, might also prove disastrous.\n\n\u201cPlease let the governments know that we are not happy with the escape of the women [who have left the camps]. We are actually scared and want to just be safe in our own embassies,\u201d she texts. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep running away. We want to be tried. I\u2019ve already had the chance to run away before and I decided to be tried in my own country.\u201d\n\nNow the pressing question, amid all of this chaos unleashed by Trump greenlighting the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria: Is anyone going to do anything to get these former ISIS wives and their children back home where they can face justice and live in safety or do we just leave them to face whatever fate turns up as hostile armies converge?", "description": "As the Turks and Syrians close in from opposite directions, these women and their children don\u2019t expect much sympathy, but they don\u2019t want to die.", "authors": ["Anne Speckhard"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1350,w_2400,x_300,y_168/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571332064/191017-Speckhard-ISIS-camp-tease_swd4ms", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
