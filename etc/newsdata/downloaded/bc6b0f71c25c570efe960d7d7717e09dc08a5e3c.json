(AP) - Aaron Rodgers presented Matt LaFleur with the game ball Thursday night after the Green Bay Packers\u2018 10-3 victory over the Chicago Bears. It was LaFleur\u2019s first regular-season victory as an NFL head coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got such a high regard for him, not only as a football player but as a person,\u201d LaFleur said Friday. \u201cI can sit up here and talk all day about how much fun I enjoy working with him. But I think that really shows our relationship, how it is. I told him I need to be better for him, too. And not only him, but for all our guys.\u201d\n\nThe Packers\u2018 offense - LaFleur\u2019s offense - has to be better. The unit had minus-12 yards in the first quarter before finally opening things up at the start of the second. LaFleur needed to use some post-snap misdirection/deception on his first play call of the quarter to move the chains.\n\nEven still, the 10 points the Packers mustered tied for the fewest Green Bay has scored against the Bears since Rodgers became quarterback.\n\nLaFleur said the ability of the Chicago defense is no excuse for how poorly Green Bay executed offensively.\n\n\u201cThat defense is legit. There\u2019s no doubt about it,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Even if you\u2019re going against a good defense like that, your standards from an offensive perspective don\u2019t change. I think we all have higher expectations and higher standards for our offense to operate.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nPackers general manager Brian Gutekunst spent a lot of money over the offseason retooling and reshaping defensive coordinator Mike Pettine\u2019s side of the ball, and it\u2019s paying off.\n\nGutekunst acquired safety Adrian Amos and linebackers Preston Smith and Za\u2019Darius Smith in March through free agency. Za\u2019Darius Smith had three tackles for loss on Thursday, Preston Smith had the game-sealing sack, and Amos, who signed a four-year contract with Green Bay after spending his first four seasons in Chicago, picked off former teammate Mitch Trubisky in the end zone late in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of confidence,\u201d linebacker Blake Martinez said about the defense. \u201cI think for us it\u2019s just being consistent. I think going from here, every single day we gotta keep bringing it at practice, walkthroughs, in the meeting room to make sure we don\u2019t get complacent.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NOT WORKING\n\nLaFleur has stressed from day one the importance of establishing the run. Green Bay had just 47 yards on the ground in the win. Aaron Jones had 39 of those on 13 carries.\n\n\u201cI thought in the second half there were some moments where it felt like we were starting to get the run game going,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cWe just gotta be a little more consistent with it.\u201d\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nPunter JK Scott booted the ball nine times for 428 yards and pinned the Bears inside their own 15-yard line on three separate occasions. Two of Scott\u2019s punts traveled 63 yards, including a clutch kick in the final two minutes that sailed from his own 16 to the Bears 13.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nGeronimo Allison was seen as the guy who could step up and be Rodgers\u2018 No. 2 option behind fellow receiver Davante Adams. But Thursday night\u2019s opener was not encouraging for Allison, who only played in 50 percent of the offensive snaps (32 of 64). He finished with zero catches and wasn\u2019t targeted once.\n\nINJURED\n\nLinebacker Oren Burks (pec) and wide receiver Darrius Shepherd (hamstring) are both sidelined with injuries. Their respective statuses for Week 2 are to be determined.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n5. The Packers play five of their next six games at home at Lambeau Field.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nGreen Bay has 10 days to get ready for another division foe in Minnesota. The Packers went 0-1-1 against the Vikings last season, playing Minnesota to a 29-29 tie Sept. 16, 2018, at Lambeau.\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Aaron Rodgers presented Matt LaFleur with the game ball Thursday night after the Green Bay Packers' 10-3 victory over the Chicago Bears.
