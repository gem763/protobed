The British pound slipped 0.2% against the dollar.\n\nTrading was stronger in Asia, where the Shanghai Composite, Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index were all up 0.5%.\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe was Danske Bank, the Danish lender, which reshuffled its management this week as a money-laundering scandal continued to weigh on the company. Its shares were up 1.7% in morning trading.\n\nMeanwhile, Telenor's shares dropped 5.1% after the Norwegian telecoms giant said it had ended talks to merge its Asian business with Axiata Group Berhad. Axiata shares gained 2.3%.\n\nInvestors will be watching closely as the U.S. Labor Department releases the August jobs report later in the session. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast the U.S. economy added 149,000 jobs during the month and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.\n\nAnalysts at Barclays have flagged concerns that expectations of further interest-rate cuts from the U.S. central bank could be tempered by suggestions that the labor market is stronger than expected, sending the dollar higher.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will make a speech in Zurich later in the day, which could provide further signals about future monetary policy.\n\nThe price of oil remained steady even as Iran said it would abandon constraints on nuclear research set out in the 2015 nuclear deal, ratcheting up tensions with the U.S., which have led to conflict in the Strait of Hormuz. Brent crude was flat on Friday at $60.92 a barrel.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nStory corrected at 1007 GMT because the original misstated the day in the last paragraph as Monday in reference to brent crude.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 06, 2019 04:28 ET (08:28 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
