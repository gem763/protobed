But it\u2019s not all good news, as the exchange has also upped its fees.\n\nIn an announcement last night, Coinbase\u2018s UK CEO Zeesham Feroz wrote that UK customers can fund their wallets directly from GBP bank accounts or credit/debit cards once again.\n\nThe news comes as Coinbase had to find a new British banking partner when its relationship with Barclays came to a close \u2013 something it found with ClearBank.\n\nAs ClearBank is part of the UK\u2018s faster payments system, Coinbase is now able to offer fast transfers between Coinbase wallets and GBP bank accounts, Bloomberg reports.\n\nWhen Barclay\u2019s and Coinbase\u2018s relationship broke down, UK customers were inconvenienced as bank transfers took much longer to clear.\n\nEven though all appears to be back to normal for UK customers at least, it\u2019s not all good news.\n\nCoinbase has also reworked its fee structure on its \u201cPro\u201d platform, and as a result trading is a bit more expensive for low-volume traders. Previously, those that traded less than $10 million per month were charged a 0.3 percent fee.\n\nThere are now three new fee tiers below that figure. Fees for those investing between $0 and $10,000 have been bumped from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent. And those that trade between $10,000 and $50,000 per month have had their fees bumped up by o.05 percent.\n\nContrary to this, Coinbase has dropped the fees for big-time traders. For example, fees for those that trade between $100 million and $300 million per month have dropped by 0.3 percent. Fees are based on a trailing 30-day volume.\n\nHow these prices changes will affect traders remains to be seen, but if responses to its blog post are anything to go by, people aren\u2019t happy.\n\nWant more Hard Fork?
