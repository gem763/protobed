Pound Traders Watch Supreme Court Hearing Against Parliament", "language": "en", "text": "The drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco over the weekend rose geopolitical tensions and hammered the risk appetite. Investors are escaping equities and moving capital into the sovereign bond markets.\n\n\n\nThe US 10-year yield retreated to 1.82%, as British and European yields eased on Monday.\n\n\n\nGold is left behind the actual flight to safety. An ounce of gold slid below the $1500 mark and met limited buying interest below this level as investors favored buying sovereign bonds amid last week\u2019s slump in prices.\n\n\n\nNikkei (+0.04%), Hang Seng (-1.01%) and Shanghai\u2019s Composite (-1.02%) traded on mixed sentiment, as the ASX 200 (-0.06%) saw some support by healthcare and energy stocks.\n\n\n\nWTI and Brent crude stabilized near $62 and $68 a barrel respectively on fears that the recovery on Aramco\u2019s production site could take up to weeks and even months. The supply shortage in Saudi Arabia should keep oil prices sustained above the pre-attack levels for the weeks to come. We could see a floor building near $60 in WTI crude and near $65 in Brent. Meanwhile, the expectation that the trade talks between the US and China could lead to a temporary agreement should give an additional boost to energy prices.\n\n\n\nThe FTSE 100 closed 0.63% lower on Monday, despite the 2.71% rally in energy stocks. FTSE futures (-0.30%) hint at a soft start on Tuesday, on the back of limited risk appetite, or the lack thereof.\n\n\n\nThe pound gave back gains as discussions between Boris Johnson, and the outgoing EU President Juncker were little constructive. Although the leaders decided to intensify talks, the UK will likely remain in no man\u2019s land with the absence of \u2018legally operational solutions\u2019 to reach a comprehensive Brexit deal in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s Supreme Court will discuss the case against Johnson\u2019s most controversial suspension of parliament. If the MPs are allowed to return, expect a decent rally in the pound.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the pound\u2019s recovery should remain topped near the 1.25 mark against the US dollar. The downside correction could stretch to 1.2390, the minor 23.6% Fibonacci retracement on September rebound. But Cable will remain in the bullish consolidation zone above the 1.23 mark, which stands for the major 38.2% retracement.\n\n\n\nThe EURUSD fluctuates near the 1.10 mark, awaiting the ZEW survey results for September in Germany and the Eurozone. A soft read in German expectations could further weigh on the single currency and justify a renewed attempt below the 1.10 mark against the greenback. But the 1.0930 support should remain intact ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) policy decision.\n\n\n\nThe is expected to open 15 points higher at 12395.\n\n\n\nFOMC meets as markets and Trump push for lower rates\n\n\n\nThe FOMC starts its two-day policy meeting today. The FOMC is under a decent political pressure as President Donald Trump explicitly and relentlessly pushes for significantly lower, and ideally negative interest rates. Hence, the Fed is sandwiched between a deteriorating economy due to Trump administration\u2019s aggressive foreign policy, dovish market expectations, and a demanding president. Therefore, the Fed is broadly expected and somewhat forced to lower its interest rates by 25 basis points for the second straight meeting to meet all expectations.\n\n\n\nBut this month\u2019s accompanying statement could be less dovish to prevent the market from taking the lead and pricing in another rate cut immediately after the meeting, again.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, despite a fairly dovish stance, it seems that the Fed struggles to control the short-term interest rates, as the overnight repo jumped to 4.75% according to ICAP and settled more than 20 basis points higher within the session. Hence, the Fed may want to come up with new and creative policy tools, similar to a reverse operation twist considered by Bank of Japan (BoJ), to control the short end of the interest rate curve, to support the longer-term rates and to relieve the pressure on institutional returns.\n\n\n\nIn Japan, the BoJ may hold fire at this week\u2019s monetary policy meeting, relying on the recent yen depreciation past the 108.00 marks against the US dollar.\n\n\n\nOpening calls\n\n\n\nto open 3 points higher at 7324\n\n\n\nto open 15 points higher at 12395\n\nDisclaimer: The information and comments provided herein under no circumstances are to be considered an offer or solicitation to invest and nothing herein should be construed as investment advice.
