At Chinese New Year, I ate huge handfuls of \u2018smiling\u2019 sesame cookies. The only lunch I wanted to eat in the school canteen was dark sticky chilli and sesame chicken. But out of all these meals, it was a bowl of soba noodles from a Japanese restaurant on my 8th birthday that got me hooked. The noodles were served with a cold sauce (called gomadare) that I had to make myself by grinding up toasted white sesame seeds in a traditional bowl (called a suribachi). The bowl was gorgeous, glazed on the outside, with rough grooves on the ceramic inside to crush the seeds with. And next to it on the table, to add an extra topping of sesame, sat a bright and cheerful Slicky-N sesame-seed grinder.\n\nWhen I moved to London as a student, I tried to re-create the meals I missed from Singapore. Homesick, I baked the sesame cookies, stir-fried chicken, and attempted my mum\u2019s most complicated of recipes. But when I made the soba noodles, they didn\u2019t taste the same. Despite the gomadare, they lacked a crunch. Mid-slurp, I had a realisation and searched for \u2018red sesame grinder\u2019 on Google. Up came Slicky-N for \u00a36.50: No-one has ever clicked the order button so fast.\n\nFive years on, it\u2019s still going strong. Even though it looks like a kid\u2019s plastic toy, it\u2019s sturdy. Many reviewers say they\u2019ve owned it for years and years. I fill mine with white sesame seeds from my local Turkish grocer. For optimum flavour (and so they\u2019re easy to grind), you have to toast the seeds in a skillet with no oil and then let them completely cool before filling up the grinder. I refill my Slicky-N almost weekly, as my sesame obsession extends to almost everything I eat: I add a dusting of ground toasted sesame seeds to blanched broccoli, eggs, or even ice cream for a pinch of savoury saltiness.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
