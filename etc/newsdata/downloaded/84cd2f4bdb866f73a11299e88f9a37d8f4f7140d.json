(Loren Elliott/Reuters)\n\n'One a day'\n\nOfficial numbers on how many Canadians have been issued bans isn't currently available but the U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed the uptick.\n\n\"While I can acknowledge there has been a recent increase in the issuance of expedited removals, there has not been a policy change within CBP nor is there a quota,\" a spokesperson said in an email to CBC.\n\nSaunders, who has been practicing immigration law for two decades, said he noticed the dramatic increase in the travel bans over the summer.\n\n\"Until recently, it was very rare \u2014 maybe once every two or three years \u2014 that I would see a five-year bar [that seemed undeserved],\" he said.\n\n\"Now, I'm literally seeing one a day.\"\n\nSame rules, different application\n\nImmigration lawyer Andrew Hayes, who works for a firm that has offices in B.C. and Washington, said the reason for the increase in bans isn't totally clear \u2014 but the likely cause is an overall desire by the administration of President Donald Trump to project a toughness around issues of immigration.\n\n\"The rules that apply now have always been the rules,\" he said.\n\n\"[The change] is on how this is applied.\"\n\nHe urges travellers be as clear as possible about their plans at the border and bring all the necessary documents of proof.\n\n\"People who show up at the border that can't explain what their plan is tend to have a worse time of it,\" he said.\n\n\"You have to be able to explain where you are going, what you are doing and when you are going to return.\"", "description": "If you are thinking about driving across a U.S. border any time soon take note - immigration lawyers in British Columbia and Washington State are seeing an increase in travellers being issued five-year bans from U.S. border guards.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.3755547.1473447421!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/peace-arch-customs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
