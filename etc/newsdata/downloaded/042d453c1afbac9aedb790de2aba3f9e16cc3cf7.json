Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is leading the pack with 28 percent support \u2013 a four-point jump from last month\u2019s results. Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) jumped to second place with 20 percent support, marking a seven-point jump for the South Bend mayor. Buttigieg\u2019s spike coincides with the Suffolk University/USA Today poll released Monday, which showed the presidential hopeful rising to third place with 13 percent support among the crowded field of candidates.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) fell to third place, trailing Buttigieg by two points with 18 percent support. Most significantly, perhaps, is Biden\u2019s fourth-place status, garnering just 12 percent support \u2013 a four-point drop from September\u2019s results.\n\nThe poll shows Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) in a distant fifth place with four percent support, followed by Tom Steyer (D) and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with three percent support each. Harris\u2019s single-digit support follows weeks of pledging to blitz Iowa, telling one colleague that she was going to \u201cf*cking\u201d move there.\n\nThe poll\u2019s margin of error is +/- five percentage points:\n\nIowa Democratic Caucus: Warren 28 (+4 Since last Month)\n\nButtigieg 20 (+7)\n\nSanders 18 (+2)\n\nBiden 12 (-4)\n\nKlobuchar 4 (+1)\n\nHarris 3 (-2)\n\nSteyer 3 (+1)\n\nGabbard 2 (-4)\n\nYang 2 (-1)\n\nEveryone else 1% or less Iowa State University/@Civiqs Pollhttps://t.co/TFEtJZaDBB \u2014 Political Polls (@PpollingNumbers) October 24, 2019\n\nRespondents were also asked to choose a second choice candidate.\n\n\u201cIf the Democratic Caucuses were held today, which one of the following candidates would be your second choice?\u201d the survey asked.\n\nThe order among top-tier candidates remained unchanged.
