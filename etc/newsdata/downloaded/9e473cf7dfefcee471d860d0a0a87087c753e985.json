The relationship between the two was \"highly suspicious\", he said.\n\nResponding to the allegations, Makhubo said: \"The mayor is dragging me into this latest issue of a dispute between Cedar Park and the City given that Cedar Park is partly owned by Regiments.\n\n\"Whenever Regiments or the sinking fund are mentioned, he regurgitates the same rhetoric even when the issue at hand has nothing to do with me. Since the mayor began making these allegations, which are criminal in nature, we have requested that he present evidence to the authorities, so that the law can take its course. We are still waiting.\"\n\nMakhubo said Johannesburg Property Company (JPC) reported to the economic development department and pointed out that, except for reports JPC took to the mayoral committees, which are discussed collectively, as MMC of finance he would have had nothing to do with the deal.", "description": "Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba's comments on Sandton Gautrain station water cuts display 'extreme desperation', Gauteng Public Transport and Road Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5550/635968f4e94e49df8d4c29972f4dca9a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
