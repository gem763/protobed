We'll look at South32 Limited's (ASX:S32) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company's share price. South32 has a price to earnings ratio of 24.84, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 4.0%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for South32\n\nHow Do I Calculate South32's Price To Earnings Ratio?\n\nThe formula for P/E is:\n\nPrice to Earnings Ratio = Share Price (in reporting currency) \u00f7 Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for South32:\n\nP/E of 24.84 = $1.91 (Note: this is the share price in the reporting currency, namely, USD ) \u00f7 $0.077 (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)\n\nIs A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?\n\nA higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn't a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business's prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.\n\nHow Does South32's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?\n\nThe P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. The image below shows that South32 has a higher P/E than the average (11.9) P/E for companies in the metals and mining industry.\n\nASX:S32 Price Estimation Relative to Market, September 8th 2019 More\n\nThat means that the market expects South32 will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn't guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.\n\nHow Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios\n\nGenerally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company's P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the 'E' increases, over time. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.\n\nSouth32's earnings per share fell by 70% in the last twelve months.\n\nRemember: P/E Ratios Don't Consider The Balance Sheet\n\nIt's important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).\n\nSuch spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.\n\nSouth32's Balance Sheet\n\nSouth32 has net cash of US$1.0b. This is fairly high at 11% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.\n\nThe Bottom Line On South32's P/E Ratio\n\nSouth32 trades on a P/E ratio of 24.8, which is above its market average of 17.2. The recent drop in earnings per share would make some investors cautious, but the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If fails to eventuate, the current high P/E could prove to be temporary, as the share price falls.\n\nInvestors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated.
