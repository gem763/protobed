Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Gennifer Flowers\u2014their stories can blur, but each of these women has a distinct set of allegations, and Broaddrick\u2019s are the most serious. She says Clinton raped her in 1978, when he was the attorney general of Arkansas and she was a volunteer for his gubernatorial campaign. She did not report the alleged crime to the police; in fact, Broaddrick\u2019s name wasn\u2019t made public until two decades later, via a 1998 court filing in the Paula Jones case. (Clinton denied the allegations.) Even though Broaddrick did some press\u2014once she\u2019d been outed, she wanted the chance to share her perspective\u2014the story didn\u2019t stick to the Clinton legacy the way Lewinsky\u2019s has. At the time, her claims were mostly ignored, and when acknowledged they were often disparaged; the fact that she\u2019d recanted in an affidavit after being subpoenaed by Jones\u2019s lawyers was a favorite data point of critics. (Broaddrick says she denied that anything had happened with Clinton because she didn\u2019t want to get involved in a big legal circus with Jones.)\n\nRead: Bill Clinton: a reckoning\n\nBut the worst part of the aftermath had already happened by then, Broaddrick told me. Clinton had been the leader of the free world for five long years. \u201cJust seeing him on TV, it was constant. I don\u2019t know who got to be the quickest, my husband or me, switching the channel,\u201d she said. She even ended up going to an earlier church service, because at her usual one the priest had taken to asking congregants to pray for the president. \u201cI had to sit in church, down on my knees, and be told that I am to pray for Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\nBy the early aughts, she\u2019d faded into relative obscurity and basically moved on with her life. Then Hillary Clinton ran for president, and her pronounced pro-woman agenda stirred up decades-old resentment. \u201cI kept thinking, Why can\u2019t you see this huge elephant in the room?\u201d Broaddrick recalled. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you see this woman for what she really is?\u201d One day, Broaddrick decided she had to weigh in. Though she\u2019d tweeted only three times before the 2016 election cycle, she sent out a statement that went viral: \u201cI was 35 years old when Bill Clinton, Ark. Attorney General raped me. I am now 73 \u2026 it never goes away.\u201d Nine months later, the Trump campaign issued what would be a fateful invitation: Would she sit in the audience during the candidate\u2019s second debate with Hillary Clinton?\n\nSince that October evening, Broaddrick has popped up semi-regularly on Fox News and become something of a MAGA thought leader, with 133,000 followers on Twitter, where her commentary ranges from insults (like calling Representative Schiff \u201cSchiff for Brains\u201d) to borderline hate speech (retweeting a picture of the short-haired soccer star Megan Rapinoe and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez captioned \u201cBoy Meets Girl\u201d). She travels the country speaking to conservative groups and signing copies of her self-published memoir, You\u2019d Better Put Some Ice on That (so named for the last thing Broaddrick says Clinton uttered before leaving the scene of the alleged assault, in which he bit her lip so violently that he drew blood).", "description": "Juanita Broaddrick, who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978, has found new life as a Trump defender.", "authors": ["Amanda Fitzsimons"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/2019/08/DIS_Sketch_Fitzsimons_Broderick_crops/facebook.jpg?1566932163", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
