I scooped Harley into my arms and he let out a scream and started whingeing.\n\nThen his eyes closed, and he went floppy. An ambulance rushed us to hospital where a team of 30 doctors worked on Harley.\n\nBut before long, a doctor took me to one side. \u2018I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s nothing more we can do,\u2019 he said gently. I held my baby boy in my arms as he died.\n\nThere was barely a mark on him, it looked like he was sleeping. But he\u2019d been crushed by the television and his little body couldn\u2019t take the massive internal injuries.\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n'A sign from Harley'\n\nAfter Harley died, I broke down. I pushed everyone away, and Kelvin and I ended up splitting. For a long time, I didn\u2019t see the point of carrying on without Harley.\n\nBut then I saw a spiritualist, who told me Harley wanted to be a big brother. \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019re pregnant,\u2019 she told me. I thought it was a load of rubbish.\n\nBut it played on my mind, so two days later, in 2016, I took a test. It was positive. This is a sign from Harley, I thought.\n\nKnowing I was carrying Harley\u2019s little brother helped me turn my life around but when little Jace was born in March 2017, I started to get anxious.\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n'We'll honour his memory forever'\n\n\u2018Is he alive?\u2019 I asked doctors, the second he came into the world. Terrified something bad would happen to him too, I didn\u2019t let Jace out of my sight.\n\nI was convinced I was jinxed and something terrible would happen again. I even tried to stop him crawling in case he had an accident. \u2018You\u2019ve got to let him be a kid,\u2019 Mum said gently one day.\n\nAnd when Jace reached 10 months, the age Harley was when he died, I started to relax a little. His milestones have been bittersweet.\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\n(Image: Medavia)\n\nI\u2019m glad he\u2019s progressing, but I\u2019m sad Harley never reached them.\n\nNow two, I tell Jace all about his amazing big brother. I\u2019ll never get over the day my baby was killed by the television but I believe Harley sent me Jace to help me through, and I\u2019ll make sure we honour his memory forever.\"", "description": "Brave Natalie Bifulco writes of her devastation at the freak accident that killed her ten-month-old baby Harley", "authors": ["Natalie Bifulco", "Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Medavia"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20464100.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Natalie-Bifulco.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
