He made some very big mistakes,\u201d Trump said a day after his abrupt ousting of Bolton.\n\nHe said the \"Libyan model\" remark had set back talks with North Korea and was \u201cnot a good statement to make.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it set us back, and frankly he wanted to do things \u2014 not necessarily tougher than me \u2014 You know John\u2019s known as a tough guy. He\u2019s so tough he got us into Iraq \u2026 but he\u2019s actually somebody I had a very good relationship with.

And that's not a question of being tough. That\u2019s a question of being not smart to say something like that.\u201d\n\nTrump later belittled Bolton as \"Mr. Tough Guy.\"\n\n\u201cJohn wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing and actually in some cases he thought it was too tough what we were doing,\" he said. \"Mr. Tough Guy, you know, you had to go into Iraq.
