Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) and former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nClinton and Nielsen were both slated to deliver a speech at the event in Washington, D.C., but the former first lady canceled her planned appearance because of scheduling issues, her team claimed.\n\nSlate reports:\n\n[A] person close to Clinton\u2019s decision-making process told Slate that she had decided to drop out after hearing that Nielsen was also on the docket. \u201cWe work with a lot of activists who are trying to do their best to improve this horrible situation down at the border,\u201d the person said, citing Clinton\u2019s support of RAICES and other organizations that advocate for asylees and immigrants. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s an easy decision. You have to side with them.\u201d The person said one of those activists alerted Clinton to Nielsen\u2019s slot on the schedule earlier this week, after which Clinton\u2019s team notified Fortune that she would no longer be attending the event. Friday evening, Clinton\u2019s name and headshot were removed from the summit\u2019s website.\n\nNielsen\u2019s inclusion in the event has garnered blowback, resulting in over 51,000 people signing a petition demanding Fortune boot the former Trump cabinet member from the event. However, Fortune communications manager Alison Klooster signaled there are no plans to bow to the pressure campaign:\n\nFortune strongly believes that interviewing Nielsen\u2014and other key figures from the private and public sector, however controversial\u2014is important journalism and provides us an opportunity to ask substantive questions in front of our viewers and readers.\n\nNielsen served as head of the DHS from December 6th, 2017 to April 10th, 2019. The event will take place over October 21st-23rd.\n\nIn addition to Nielsen, 2020 presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) \u2014 whom Clinton attacked on Friday as \u201cthe favorite of the Russians\u201d \u2014 is also scheduled to attend the Fortune event. Appearing on a podcast hosted by David Plouffe, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign manager, Clinton claimed Gabbard was being \u201cgroomed\u201d by the Kremlin as a potential third-party candidate.\n\nGabbard clapped back at Clinton in a series of tweets, branding her the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and the culprit behind a smear piece published by the New York Times ahead of this week\u2019s Democrat presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio:\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain.
