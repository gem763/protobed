You have a camera in your face and you don\u2019t really want to have a camera in your face.\u201d\n\nJustin Gatlin, who won silver in the 100m, made his own preparations for the camera angle. \u201cI made sure I had my lucky underwear on,\u201d said the American.\n\nDoha\u2019s empty seats tell tale of corruption, warped priorities and vested interests | Richard Williams Read more\n\nFor others, the perceived invasion of privacy was not a laughing matter. The backlash against the intrusive angles started as soon as athletes received images from the \u201ccrotch cams\u201d.\n\n\u201cMy friends told me the pictures weren\u2019t very flattering,\u201d said Britain\u2019s Dina Asher-Smith, who made history on Wednesday when she won gold in the 200m.\n\nAn official complaint came from the German track and field federation. It led to the competition organizers rolling back the use of the cameras that were introduced in Doha as part of a push to attract new viewers. They\u2019ve also introduced pre-race dimming of the lights and graphics being projected on the track, updates that have received a mixed reaction.\n\n\u201cWe have noted some specific feedback about the block cameras and we have confirmed we have appropriate measures in place to protect athlete privacy during the process of selecting images for broadcast,\u201d the IAAF said in a statement. \u201cWe also have strict editorial guidelines for what is broadcast and these have been observed since the beginning of the championships.\u201d\n\nRob Harris (@RobHarris) Have you seen the \u201ccrotch cameras\u201d on starting blocks at #WorldAthleticsChampionships?\n\nSome athletes found the innovation too intrusive, so the angles have been adjusted by the IAAF after complaints.\n\nFrom Doha:https://t.co/rXHKV4FD54 pic.twitter.com/7o2TEGsEmT\n\nThe IAAF installed the two miniature cameras in the starting blocks to capture what it called the \u201cexplosion of energy\u201d from athletes who were only previously seen from above or the side of their heads. Not all competitors objected to the unfamiliar angles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool for the fan base they get to see us in the blocks,\u201d said Canada\u2019s Andre De Grasse, who won bronze in the 100m. \u201cBut you can\u2019t get distracted by it. You\u2019ve just got to focus on your race and not look too much toward the camera.\u201d\n\nThe British sprinter Zharnel Hughes welcomed the IAAF innovating but not the execution of the technology.\n\n\u201cSometimes you hear the camera inside the blocks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a cool feature but it\u2019s a bit scary at the same time because it\u2019s looking up your nose. You aren\u2019t looking at it. You know it\u2019s there because when you are set on your blocks you hear it.\u201d", "description": "Television viewers have been taken closer to the action than ever before at the world championships \u2013 and it is a little too close for some athletes", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bcbb6f2d4790f2eeaee0e314a53d68b06785027/0_288_5070_3041/master/5070.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7e5f5c699a0695c96468362b025b2939"}
