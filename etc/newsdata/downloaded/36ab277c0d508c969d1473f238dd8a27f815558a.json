Mark Milley said they have stressed to their counterparts in Ankara that \u201cunilateral action creates risks for Turkey.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry nevertheless stated on Tuesday that \u201call preparations for the operation have been completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe establishment of a Safe Zone/Peace Corridor is essential for Syrians to have a safe life by contributing to the stability and peace of our region. Turkish Security Forces will never tolerate the creation of a terror corridor at our borders,\u201d the Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Ministry said the operation will eliminate \u201ca serious threat to the territorial integrity and unity of Syria\u201d and \u201cprevent the recurrence of the terrorist Daesh and similar problems in the future.\u201d\n\nDaesh is another name for the Islamic State, which Turkey portrays as one of its two main nemeses in the Syrian border region. The other is the Syrian Kurdish militia known as the YPG, which Turkey regards as an extension of the PKK, a Kurdish separatist party in Turkey designated a terrorist organization by the United States, European countries, and NATO, of which Turkey is a member. All of those other nations and organizations disagree with Turkey\u2019s classification of the YPG as terrorists, having worked with the Syrian Kurds for years to defeat ISIS.\n\nTurkish officials told Reuters on Tuesday they have conducted strikes along the border between Syria and Iraq to prevent Kurdish reinforcements from moving through Iraq.\n\n\u201cIn this way, the group\u2019s transit to Syria and support lines, including ammunition, are shut off,\u201d a Turkish source said, without providing details of the strikes or how they were carried out. Reuters expressed skepticism about Turkey\u2019s claims, as its reports saw no signs of activity from major Turkish artillery positions near the border.", "description": "The Pentagon says Turkey has been removed from the \u201cair tasking order\u201d for members of the anti-Islamic State coalition operating in Syria.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/f1a609_serbia-turkey-70885-turkey-president-recep-tayyip-erdogan-speaks-joint-e1570571401211-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
