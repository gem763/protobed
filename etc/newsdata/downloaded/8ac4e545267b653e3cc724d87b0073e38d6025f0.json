Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has her photo taken at a presidential primary campaign event at Clinton College in Rock Hill, S.C., Aug. 17, 2019. (Travis Dove/The New York Times)\n\nROCK HILL, S.C. \u2014 For her most recent rally in South Carolina, Sen. Elizabeth Warren chose Clinton College, a historically black institution in this racially diverse city. Her campaign handed out signs reading, \u201cAfrican Americans With Warren.\u201d And in smaller print: \u201cBlack issues are American issues.\u201d\n\nBut when Warren looked out at the audience, she saw mostly white faces. The view reflected perhaps her biggest political challenge as she seeks the Democratic presidential nomination: adding black voters to her base of support.\n\nAfrican Americans were critical to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton winning competitive primary contests and capturing the nomination. Like those earlier candidates, Warren faces multiple rivals who may splinter the electorate this winter, and running up the vote margin in predominantly black areas could once again deliver troves of delegates needed for the nomination.\n\nWhile Warren is rising in polls thanks to support among liberals, women, young people and college-educated whites, black voters, who are the most essential part of the traditional Democratic coalition, have yet to embrace her in large numbers.\n\n\u201cI just think people don\u2019t know her yet,\u201d said Kim Ume, 51, who came to see Warren in Rock Hill. But Ume, like some other black admirers here, was hopeful: \u201cAll she needs to do is put herself in front of people.\u201d\n\nPart of Warren\u2019s challenge is that her leading rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, appears to have strong support among black Democrats, which could help him in delegate-rich states with heavily black districts like the Carolinas, Texas and Virginia that hold early primaries. (In interviews with black voters in South Carolina recently, President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden over Ukraine did not appear to worry them.) Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, the two leading black Democrats in the race, are also courting African American voters.\n\nBut more broadly, Warren is running an ideologically left-wing campaign and basing her appeal on policy proposals more so than long-standing relationships and endorsements. Sen. Bernie Sanders ran a similar campaign in 2016 and lost black voters in landslides to Hillary Clinton, who was better known and had key allies among black leaders, most importantly Obama. Warren has several months to build ties, of course, but many black voters measure political relationships in years, not months.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard very little about her,\u201d Charles Rodgers, 57, said after leaving a library in downtown Columbia. He said he had not yet paid close attention to the primary race, given the size of the field.\n\nThe clear deficit with black votes stands out in part because, on so many other fronts, Warren is excelling. She is now running closely with Biden in polls in the first two states to vote, Iowa and New Hampshire, where the electorate is overwhelmingly white. She is well positioned to navigate the rushing political waters of impeachment, having called for the House to begin an inquiry for months. And the sizable crowd in Rock Hill, which her campaign put at 1,400, was another sign of the palpable interest in her candidacy.\n\nAt the same time, the largely white audience was only the latest sign that she still has a long way to go in increasing her support among black voters. Six weeks earlier, when she held a rally in Aiken, South Carolina, the crowd that turned out was also predominantly white.\n\nAsked recently about her limited support among black voters, Warren refrained from offering a political analysis. Instead, she ticked off a number of policy issues that are important to African Americans, and that she has plans to address, such as housing and maternal mortality.\n\n\u201cThe way I see this is that African American women have really been the backbone of the Democratic Party for generations now,\u201d Warren said as she spoke with reporters. \u201cThey get out there and they fight for people. And what I\u2019m doing is showing up and trying to talk to people about why I\u2019m in this fight.\u201d\n\nSix in 10 voters in South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary in 2016 were black, and they favored Clinton over Sanders by 72 percentage points, according to exit polls. This time, it is Biden who is counting on black voters to propel him to a victory in South Carolina, the fourth state to hold a nominating contest in 2020.", "description": "ROCK HILL, S.C. -- For her most recent rally in South Carolina, Sen.
