Last year, the rate hit its lowest point in a decade, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday.\n\nThe drop is modest, but health officials say it is good news.\n\nPregnancy with more than one raises the risks of complications and death for both the mother and her fetuses. Complications include premature birth and a low birth weight.\n\nTwin births have hit a decade low in the US, according to the latest CDC figures, released Thursday. Experts say that that's good news as twins are more likely to be premature and small\n\n'In the media, there are often stories about very cute twins and talking about how great to have two babies at the same time,' said the CDC\u00b4s Dr Dmitry Kissin.\n\nBut 'these stories don\u00b4t focus on the risk.'\n\nNearly 60 percent of twins are born preterm, at an average of 32 weeks into their mothers' pregnancy, compared to 39 weeks for singleton babies.\n\nWith preterm birth often comes potential health problems, such as low birthweight and underdeveloped lungs.\n\nLast year, about 124,000 babies were twins - about one of every 31 births, the same as a decade earlier. The rate peaked at one in 29 in 2014.\n\nThe CDC did not release figures on triplets or other multiple births, but said data suggests it\u00b4s trending the same way.\n\nExperts can't say for sure what's driving the decline.\n\nBut Joyce Martin, the report\u00b4s lead author, noted the decrease occurred only in white women and in women 30 or older.\n\nThose women are the biggest customers of expensive in vitro fertilization treatments, which are involved in roughly 15 percent of multiple births.\n\nAnd there\u00b4s been a shift in how that technique is done.\n\nIn vitro fertilization involves surgically removing eggs from a woman\u00b4s ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and transferring the days-old embryo to the woman\u00b4s uterus.\n\nMore than a decade ago, it was standard to implant two or more embryos to improve the chances of success.\n\nBut that also greatly increased the odds of more than one baby.\n\nSince then, there have been advances in growing embryos longer in the lab and testing them for genetic problems.\n\nThat\u00b4s allowed doctors to select the best single embryo to use, said Dr Aaron Styer, an infertility treatment specialist in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.\n\nThe success rate for one embryo rose from about 20 percent in the 1980s to around 50 percent today, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, insurers and medical organizations increasingly have been pushing doctors to transfer single embryos more often.\n\nPatients have bought into it. They understand that\u00b4s the ideal pregnancy, Dr Styer said.\n\nToday, about two-thirds of IVF procedures use one embryo, according to the CDC\u00b4s Dr Kissin.", "description": "Since the peak of twin births in the US in 2014, the rate has fallen by 4%..
