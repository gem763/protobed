But just a few months later, she returned to Vancouver for another business trip, during which she saw Dave again and the pair went on their first date.\n\nAlthough they knew they wouldn\u2019t get to live in the same city for a year until Emily moved back to Canada, they both felt there was something good between them and opted to try a long-distance relationship.\n\nThe pair spoke about how they\u2019d decorate a flat together and what trips they\u2019d take when they were reunited. Dave even found a flat and the lease began in April 2019.\n\nBut after experiencing night sweats, bloating, kidney pain and fatigue for a few weeks, Emily saw her GP who referred her for an ultrasound.\n\nThe results of the ultrasound looked troubling, so Emily had an emergency MRI and on 19 March 2019, she was diagnosed with germ cell ovarian cancer.\n\nWithin a week of her diagnosis Dave flew to London to be with her. Emily\u2019s cancer was aggressive and she began chemotherapy immediately, followed by surgery to remove a 17cm tumour.\n\n\u201cThe afternoon of my diagnosis, I met with a gynaecological oncology surgeon to discuss my options,\u201d Emily said.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking to hear all of this over a few hours. Then a few days later, I had a CT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread. Fortunately, it hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMy GP said that based on the results of the CT scan, and the size and speed of tumour growth, I\u2019d undergo four to six months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before they operated.\u201d\n\nThe cancer diagnosis derailed the couple\u2019s plans to live together, but Dave made the decision to quit his job in Vancouver and move to London so that he could support Emily.\n\nThe global brand ambassador believes that the months spent living together in London deeply strengthened their relationship because Dave remained by her side throughout her battle.\n\n\u201cI knew early on there was something special about Dave and I was so excited to build a home with him.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in London many of our phone conversations were spent planning how we\u2019d decorate the flat, the trips we\u2019d go on and how we\u2019d like to spend our lives together.\n\n\u201cThe one positive thing about the cancer diagnosis was that we got to live together sooner than we\u2019d planned, even though the situation wasn\u2019t quite what we had planned.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the months in London strengthened our relationship. He was by my side the whole time, and while our plan A might\u2019ve been easier, I wouldn\u2019t trade the time we spent together or the experiences we\u2019ve shared,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily reveals that she and Dave are now planning to start a family.\n\n\u201cDave has been part of the fertility conversation since my diagnosis because this affects him too.\n\n\u201cWe talked about having kids before my diagnosis and he\u2019s been so supportive throughout this entire process.\n\n\u201cHe wants the best for me and we both agree that the best thing is for me to survive.\n\n\u201cThroughout this whole process Dave has never made me feel like he was trapped or angry for the unexpected turn our lives took.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the strongest man I\u2019ve ever met and he was there for me every step of the way. Something like this brings out the truth in a person and I feel like I truly know him.\u201d\n\nSources: Magazine Features", "description": "Despite only going on one date, this woman\u2019s boyfriend moved from Vancouver to London to be with her after her shock cancer diagnosis.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/e577fe0b9fab42f696c24c7fb07ac437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
