Joe just stood at slip watching (Steve) Smith take the match away from us.\n\n\u201cAs much as we all love Joe it seems he does not have a feel for the nuances of the game.\u201d\n\nRelated Coverage England name unchanged squad for final Ashes test\n\nBoycott believes the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) will be wary of taking the captaincy away from Root but his criticism is echoed by another former captain Nasser Hussain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been clear in this game that Root has felt let down by some of his bowlers, especially on the first day,\u201d Hussain told the Daily Mail. \u201cBut he knows the buck stops with him. It\u2019s up to the captain to get the best out of his team.\u201d\n\n(This story refiles to change spelling of Alasdair to Alastair in par 7)", "description": "Joe Root came out fighting after Australia retained the Ashes with a thrilling victory in the fourth test at Old Trafford on Sunday but questions remain about his effectiveness as captain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427934127&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8813B", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
