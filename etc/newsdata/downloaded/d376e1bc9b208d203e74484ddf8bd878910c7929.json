A University of Kansas researcher was recently charged with collecting federal grant money while working full-time for a Chinese university, and a Chinese government employee was arrested in a visa fraud scheme allegedly aimed at recruiting US research talent.\n\nThe Justice Department launched last year an effort called the China Initiative aimed at identifying priority trade secret cases and focusing resources on them.\n\n'Existentially, we look at China as our greatest threat from an intelligence perspective, and they succeeded significantly in the last decade from stealing our best and brightest technology,' said top US counterintelligence official William Evanina.\n\nAssistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department's top national security official, said: 'What we're trying to do is highlight the risk to them without discouraging them from welcoming the researchers and students from a country like China'\n\nThe most consequential case this year centered not on a university but on Huawei, charged with stealing corporate trade secrets and evading sanctions.\n\nThe company denies wrongdoing. Several universities including Illinois, which received the FBI email last February, have begun severing ties with Huawei.\n\nBut the government's track record hasn't been perfect.\n\nFederal prosecutors in 2015 dropped charges against a Temple University professor earlier accused of sending designs for a pocket heater to China.\n\nThe professor, Xiaoxing Xi, is suing the FBI. 'It was totally wrong,' he said, 'so I can only speak from my experience that whatever they put out there is not necessarily true.'\n\nRichard Wood, the then-interim provost at the University of New Mexico, conveyed ambivalence in an email to colleagues last year.\n\nHe wrote that he took seriously the concerns the FBI had identified to him in briefings, but also said 'there are real tensions' with the 'traditional academic norms regarding the free exchange of scientific knowledge wherever appropriate.'\n\nThe most consequential case this year centered not on a university but on Huawei, charged with stealing corporate trade secrets and evading sanctions\n\n'I do not think we would be wise to create new \"policy\" on terrain this complex and fraught with internal trade-offs between legitimate concerns and values without some real dialogue on the matter,' Wood wrote.\n\nFBI officials say they've received consistently positive feedback from universities. The emails show administrators at schools including the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and Nebraska requesting briefings, training or generally expressing eagerness for cooperation.\n\nKevin Gamache, chief research security officer for the Texas A&M University system, told the AP that he values his FBI interactions and that it flows in both directions.\n\n'It's a dialogue that has to be ongoing.'\n\nThe vice president for research and economic development at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas welcomed the assistance in a city she noted was the 'birthplace of atomic testing.\n\n'We have a world-class radiochemistry faculty, our College of Engineering has significant numbers of faculty and students from China, and we have several other issues of concern to me as VPR. In all of these cases, the FBI is always available to help,' the administrator wrote to agents.\n\nMore than two dozen universities produced records, including symposium itineraries and a 13-page FBI pamphlet titled 'China: The Risk to Academia' that warns that China does 'not play by the same rules of academic integrity' as American universities.\n\nSome emails show agents seeking tips or following leads.\n\n'If you have concerns about any faculty or graduate researchers, students, outside vendors ... pretty much anything we previously discussed - just reminding you that I am here to help,' one wrote to Iowa State officials in 2017.\n\nIn May, an agent sent the University of Washington a records request for two researchers' emails, seeking references to Chinese-government talent recruitment programs.\n\nLast year, an agent asked Oklahoma State University if it had researchers in encryption research or quantum computing.\n\nThe University of Colorado received an FBI request about an 'internal investigation' into a professor's 'possible misuse' of NIH funds. The school told the AP that it found no misconduct and the professor has resigned.\n\nThough espionage concerns aren't new, FBI officials report an uptick in targeting of universities and more US government attention too. The FBI says it's seen some progress from universities, with one official saying schools are more reliably pressing researchers about outside funding sources.\n\nDemers, the Justice Department official, said espionage efforts are 'as pervasive, as well-resourced, as ever today.\n\n'It's a serious problem today on college campuses.'", "description": "Intelligence agents have lectured at seminars, briefed administrators in campus meetings and distributed pamphlets at US universities with cautionary tales of trade secret theft.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19403044-0-image-a-36_1570462745970.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
