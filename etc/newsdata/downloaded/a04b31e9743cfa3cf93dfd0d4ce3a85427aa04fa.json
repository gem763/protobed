No 10 said it would abide by their decision.\n\nBut former Tory MP Dominic Grieve - who had the Conservative whip removed after voting to block a no-deal Brexit - called for Parliament's immediate recall and said if it was the case the government had misled the Queen, Mr Johnson should resign.\n\nThe judges made it \"quite clear\" the explanation for suspending Parliament was \"simply inaccurate and untrue\", he added.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption There were a number of protests around the country after the government confirmed it was suspending Parliament\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: \"Most people didn't believe Boris Johnson, but for the courts to find he has unlawfully shut down Parliament and that his motive wasn't the one he said it was? That's very powerful.\n\n\"I call on him to recall Parliament. Let's get it back open, and sitting this afternoon and tomorrow, so we can debate what happens next and we can debate this judgement.\"\n\nSNP's leader in Westminster Ian Blackford, who has written to the prime minister to insist Parliament is recalled, said: \"Every day Parliament remains suspended, Boris Johnson and the UK government are shutting down democracy.\"\n\nAngry MPs protested in the Commons as Parliament was shut down for five weeks on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the suspension, parties are due to hold their annual conferences but no debates, votes or official committee scrutiny sessions will take place.\n\nFollowing the court ruling, some MPs - including Labour's Kevin Brennan - said they were returning to Parliament.\n\nLabour's Luke Pollard tweeted: \"Quietly and peacefully I have gone back to sit in my usual spot in the House of Commons. No shouting or scuffles - just a quiet statement about our democracy.\"\n\nGovernment sources said those trying to recall Parliament were seeking to pre-empt the appeal on Tuesday.\n\nNo 10 also denied reports that sources had been critical of the Scottish judges.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland later tweeted he had \"total confidence\" in the court's independence.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @RobertBuckland Our judges are renowned around the world for their excellence and impartiality and I have total confidence in their independence in every case. \u2014 Robert Buckland QC MP (@RobertBuckland) September 11, 2019 Report\n\nWhile it awaited the verdict of the Supreme Court, No 10 said it stood by its justification for curtailing the current Parliament session.\n\nIt said it had been the longest in almost 400 years, that Parliament had in recent months become \"one of the least active\" and that the PM wanted to put a \"proper domestic legislative programme\" before MPs.\n\nBut the SNP's Joanna Cherry, who was one of the lawyers involved in the case in Scotland, said Parliament should be recalled \"for the time being\".\n\nShe told the BBC that, even if the Supreme Court were to issue its decision immediately, \"we will have lost about 10 days of Parliamentary time.\"\n\n\"We think Parliament should go back and get on with the job of scrutinising this government, looking at what they're up to,\" she added.\n\nThe BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the law in Scotland was different to that in England and the ruling would put \"massive pressure\" on the Supreme Court over who to side with.\n\nA bombshell moment?\n\nThe response of Team Johnson this morning has been to say \"calm down, we are not recalling Parliament now, just wait and see what the Supreme Court decides.\"\n\nBut any way you look at it, this is bad for the prime minister and has the potential to become a full-blown bombshell moment for him.\n\nBad because he has been judged to have behaved unlawfully and, more than that, the judges clearly believe he misled Parliament.\n\nIf the Supreme Court upholds their view, it seems he will have no option but to recall Parliament which would be a political humiliation for him.\n\nOn top of that, MPs will almost certainly vote to scrap the party conference recess and sit through September right up to the 31 October Brexit deadline.\n\nThe bottom line, to put it mildly, is that an awful lot is hanging on what the judges decide on Tuesday.\n\nGuto Bebb, another Conservative rebel stripped of the whip last week, said No 10 must now release all internal communications relating to the decision to suspend Parliament as demanded by MPs in a vote on Monday.\n\n\"We now have a question as to the integrity and honesty of the Downing Street operation,\" he told Radio 4's World at One.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats' Brexit spokesman, Tom Brake, said the ruling was \"highly embarrassing\" for the prime minister, and showed prorogation was \"never more than a power grab\".\n\nBut Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the decision \"smelt\" of judicial interference.\n\n\"How can a Queen's Speech be unlawful?\" he said. \"The establishment will stop at nothing to frustrate the will of the people.\"", "description": "Opposition parties say it should return as soon as possible so scrutiny of the government can resume.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07n0k28.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
