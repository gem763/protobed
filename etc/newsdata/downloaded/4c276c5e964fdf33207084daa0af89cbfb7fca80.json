REUTERS/Kham\n\nThe five European members of the U.N. Security Council met on Tuesday to urge North Korea \u201cto take concrete steps\u201d towards giving up its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.\n\nThat call came days after North Korea said it test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, in what was the most provocative action by North Korea since it resumed dialogue with the United States in 2018.\n\nNorth Korea, as part of its efforts to sustain that dialogue, which has included three meetings between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump, has stopped testing nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\nBut North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, in a statement reported by its state KCNA news agency, raised questions about that restraint.\n\n\u201cThere is a limit to our patience and there is no law that anything we have refrained from so far will continue indefinitely,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman also denounced what he said was the U.N. Security Council\u2019s unfair taking up of the issue of North Korea\u2019s self-defense.\n\n\u201cThe fact ... is prompting us to reconsider the crucial pre-emptive steps we have taken to build trust with the U.S.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman did not elaborate on what pre-emptive steps he was referring to, but North Korean state media and officials have referred to the halting of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and the return of remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-1953 Korean War, as good-faith gestures to the United States, which it says have not been reciprocated.\n\nThe North Korean spokesman also referred to a U.S. Air Force test of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile this month.\n\nThe U.S. test was \u201cclearly carried out in order to pressure us\u201d, the North Korean spokesman said.", "description": "North Korea said on Thursday its patience has limits and it could reverse steps to build trust with the United States, as it criticized a U.N.
