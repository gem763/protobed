And public opinion could turn against him, and make him seem not so invulnerable.\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s Yale University finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller talking to Time about what he sees as an inevitability.\n\n\u201cThere will be a recession. The question is when,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m tempted to say that we\u2019re overdue for one, because this expansion will be the longest in history. That\u2019s assuming the economy isn\u2019t already in recession.\u201d\n\nIn his recently published book \u201cNarrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events,\u201d Shiller contends that \u201cif enough people begin to act fearfully, their anxiety can become self-fulfilling, and a recession, sometimes a big one, may follow.\u201d These trade headlines, he says, are weighing heavily.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going back to a 1930s narrative about a tariff war, a trade war,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling people. It\u2019s causing some people to curtail their spending. Distrust of President Trump is building.\u201d\n\nHe suggests that Trump, in the spirit of self-preservation, is constantly generating news in an attempt to distract from the reality of an expansion that is clearly getting long in the tooth and is due for a slowdown.\n\n\u201cIf we start a recession, it will discredit him,\u201d Shiller told Time. \u201cAnd public opinion could turn against him, and make him seem not so invulnerable.\u201d\n\nRecession fears didn\u2019t keep the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.11% from ending last week with a triple-digit rally, though Monday\u2019s session was mostly flat.", "description": "Yale University finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Shiller talks to Time about what he sees as an inevitability.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY436_grow_n_ZG_20171115165235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
