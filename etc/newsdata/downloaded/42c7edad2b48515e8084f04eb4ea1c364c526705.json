To the extent that Trump has harmed US credibility, he didn\u2019t do it in Syria this week by rejecting war with Turkey. He did it last month by failing to retaliate militarily against Iran\u2019s brazen military attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil installations. Whereas the US has no commitment to protect the Kurds, the US\u2019s central commitment in the Middle East for the past 70 years has been the protection of Saudi oil installations and maintaining the safety of maritime routes in and around the Persian Gulf.\n\nThe best move Trump can make now in light of the fake narrative of his treachery toward the Kurds is to finally retaliate against Iran. A well-conceived and limited US strike against Iranian missile and drone installations would restore America\u2019s posture as the dominant power in the Persian Gulf and prevent the further destabilization of the Saudi regime and the backsliding of the UAE toward Iran.", "description": "", "authors": ["Caroline Glick", "Israelhayom.Com Opinions Trump-Did-Not-Betray-The-Kurds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
