J&J declined to comment and Mr. Swanson couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nAt Bayer, Mr. Swanson led initiatives that involved data science\u2014generating insights or predictions from data using algorithms. In one example, he used data science to reduce the crop-science division\u2019s carbon footprint, according to a video on Bayer\u2019s website.\n\nJ&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky spoke about the strategic importance of data science on an earnings call in May: \u201cWe\u2019re spending a lot of time looking at data-science capabilities and how we integrate that more and more into what we\u2019re doing on a daily basis in pharma.\u201d\n\nThe company makes prescription drugs, medical devices, consumer goods such as Band-Aids and baby shampoo, and other products.\n\nMr. Swanson joins J&J at a time when the health-care industry is betting on emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to identify patients at risk for opioid abuse and chronic diseases, said Ana Gupte, an independent health-care analyst. The drugmaker this week agreed to a $20.4 million settlement to avoid a trial accusing the company of helping spark an opioid-addiction crisis in two Ohio counties.\n\nMs. Gupte said that health-care companies are also using emerging technologies to help physicians improve the accuracy of various diagnoses and to advance the development of drugs. \u201cArtificial intelligence and machine learning are pretty critical for a company like J&J,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Swanson has a reputation for being a solid manager and technology leader, said Gerry McNamara, senior partner for the technology officers practice at executive-search firm Korn Ferry. \u201cHe\u2019s a very highly collaborative team player, thoughtful on the field with his people and rolls up his sleeves when necessary,\u201d Mr. McNamara said. Korn Ferry wasn\u2019t involved in Mr. Swanson\u2019s recruitment.\n\nAt J&J, Mr. Swanson is based at the drugmaker\u2019s headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J. At Bayer, he was based in Monheim, Germany, according to the company\u2019s website. The new CIO at Bayer\u2019s crop-science unit is Ingo Elfering, formerly CIO and innovation officer at U.K.-based drugmaker Indivior PLC.\n\nBefore joining Bayer, Mr. Swanson was CIO at seed and pesticide company Monsanto, acquired by Bayer for $63 billion in 2018.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2005, Mr. Swanson was an IT executive at J&J\u2019s research-and-development division. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in bioscience and biotechnology as well as a master\u2019s degree in computer science, both from Drexel University.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "Jim Swanson, formerly a technology executive at Bayer\u2019s crop-science division, has joined Johnson & Johnson as chief information officer.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-113461/social"}
