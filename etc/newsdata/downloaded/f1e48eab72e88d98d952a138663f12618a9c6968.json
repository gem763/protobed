He said it had some embarrassing stuff on it. I did reassure him I wasn't interested in his embarrassing photos or whatever he had.\n\n'While we were talking to him he was scrolling through his phone. He was sat opposite me and I could just see the back of his hand but he was, what I would say, frantically going through his phone.'\n\nThe officer said Lacomba agreed to sign a consent form allowing the downloading of call logs, contacts, chats, messaging, WhatsApp and texts.\n\nProsecutors say movements of a taxi they believe is Lacomba's after Ms Wellgreen went missing show he was her killer, despite her not having been found. Pictured: Lacomba's car\n\nBut when asked about other options such as location data, he replied 'there was no point' as he had switched it off.\n\nHis attitude was said to have 'completely changed' when he was asked to permit the recovery of any deleted data.\n\n'He got quite animated. He said 'Why would I want you to have deleted stuff when I have deleted it for a reason?'' DC King told the court.\n\nShe added Lacomba then 'scrutinised' the consent form before eventually handing the phone over. He never agreed however to them retrieving any deleted data.\n\n'He was reluctant. I kept having to tell him to switch it off and put it in the evidence bag.'\n\nLacomba was told the Samsung S8 would be returned to him the next morning.\n\nBut as the officers left at 8.50pm, he followed them and demanded it back.\n\n'He said that he had changed his mind and wanted his phone back. He said he needed it for work. I explained we could download it back at the station there and then and get it back to him that night,' said DC King.\n\nThe footage filmed at several houses and farm buildings near the beautician's home in Kent\n\n'After a while, because we did stand there for a while to convince him, he got quite animated again and said 'You said it was voluntary and I didn't have to give it to you so I want it back.' I had to give it back to him.'\n\nThe court heard earlier in the trial that he told his mum the following day that he had subsequently 'chucked it in the river'.\n\nSarah's sons Lewis, 23, and 22-year-old Jack Burdett, and her mum Ann Reid were at court for the first time since the trial started last week.\n\nThey sat in the public gallery on what was the eve of the first anniversary of Sarah vanishing.\n\nIn a statement Lewis gave to police after Sarah vanished he said: 'I know my mother. She would not just leave her children.....She would not do that.\n\n'She loved the children. She has never gone off before. She always keeps in touch.'\n\nThe prosecution say 'compelling evidence' points to Lacomba being guilty, including CCTV footage of a vehicle 'similar' to his Vauxhall Zafira taxi driving along isolated country lanes near his home in Bazes Shaw between 2.20am and 4.27am on October 10.\n\nAt the start of Lacomba's trial, the court heard she was 'in good spirits' at the time she vanished.\n\nPolice during the search for Ms Wellgreen. She has never been found and prosecutors say she was murdered\n\nShe had landed a new job with a good salary and was in the process of buying Lacomba out of his share in the family home.\n\nDespite being under the same roof, the couple led 'completely separate lives', with Sarah in a new relationship and also seeing other male friends.\n\nIn one of her final texts, sent to her on/off boyfriend Neil James on the night she was allegedly murdered, Sarah referred to Lacomba as 'a fat t**t' and there was 'tension and problems' between them, said prosecutor Alison Morgan QC.\n\nIt is alleged his possible motive for murdering Sarah before disposing of her body was the potential loss of his property and resulting limited contact with his children.\n\nExtensive searches of the area and trawling approximately 22,000 hours within a five-mile radius of her home have not uncovered any trace and her body has ever been found.\n\nHer Hyundai car, handbag, purse and mobile phones were left behind, and she had no contact with any of her family or friends after 10pm on October 9.\n\nShe was last seen alive on neighbour's CCTV as she returned home from work that evening at 7.57pm.\n\nMiss Morgan said: 'The prosecution alleges that the defendant murdered Sarah in a calculated manner, designed to avoid detection, to leave no trace and to remove Sarah Wellgreen.\n\n'Despite his best efforts, he did leave a trace. In fact, he left far more than a trace of evidence.\n\n'The prosecution alleges that what he left behind provides a compelling picture from which you can be sure that he alone is responsible for Sarah Wellgreen's murder and disappearance.'\n\nAs well as his taxi allegedly being caught on camera in the early hours of October 10, it was said Lacomba had switched off his home's 'elaborate' security camera system that night and parked away from his usual spot adjacent to his house in a spot not covered by a CCTV.\n\nIt was also more than 24 hours before he reported Sarah's disappearance to police, and only after her family raised concerns about her well-being and whereabouts.\n\nTexts to her phone went unanswered and calls went to voicemail, with no activity on her Facebook account, the court heard.\n\nMore than 19 hours after her last communication, an anxious Mr James messaged Sarah to ask 'Are you alive?'\n\nYesterday the jury at Woolwich Crown Court heard the initial 999 call and then subsequent 'high priority' call in which Lacomba claimed his ex had a 'complicated and messy' lifestyle.\n\nHe said she had up to seven phones, and claimed she had been stalked and assaulted at work.\n\nHe described how they shared the house for the sake of their children but that Sarah was 'sort of like seeing a few blokes' other than Mr James, adding 'and so it looks like she's cheating on him'.\n\nLacomba described how Sarah split her time between living in the family home, at Mr James's home in Farnham, Surrey, and in Portsmouth where she worked for Puresun beauty salon.
