Martin believed his nightmare to be over, but little did he know it was only just beginning, as Ben set about seeking retribution and, while doing so, reminded Martin of who\u2019s boss.\n\nMartin has been accompanying Tubbs on several pick-ups over the last couple of weeks, and as a result, he\u2019s become a shell of his former self. The dodgy activities were impacting his life greatly, and thus he decided that enough was enough, and opened up to Jack (Scott Maslen) during last night\u2019s episode about the whole thing.\n\nThe pair orchestrated a plan, and Ben was caught in the act and subsequently arrested for his illegal money-lending activities. Martin later informed Ben that this was the end of their alliance, before calling the Mitchell lad a coward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was clear that Ben wasn\u2019t going to let him away with such a betrayal and tonight he set about seeking revenge. With Tubbs having been released from jail, Ben orchestrated a plan to put Martin in his place, and thus they waited in the Square \u2014 hoping for the Fowler legend to make an appearance.\n\nMeanwhile, Martin was partaking in a movie marathon with Bex (Jasmine Armfield) in an attempt to make up for how he\u2019s neglected her as of late. However, when the ice-cream ran out, Martin resolved to make a trip and stock up on the goods.\n\nWhile on his way back, he was ambushed and beaten. Later, he found himself hanging upside down from the railway bridge \u2014 the very same bridge where he took a much younger Ben all those years ago. The thugs pulled him back up \u2014 just as a train rushed by, and they held his face within inches of the speeding machine.\n\nAfter the train passed, Martin set his sights on Ben, who possessed that sweet look of revenge in his eyes \u2014 while wearing that dashing new coat of his. He informed Martin that he will continue to do his bidding for him, but when Martin refused to do so, Tubbs and his mates hung him from the bridge once more, as Ben threatened Stacey (Lacey Turner) and their children.\n\nA devastated Martin returned home and broke down while looking at Bex \u2014 having no clue as to how he\u2019s going to get himself out of this situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill Martin do as Ben asks?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ben\u2019s darker side has well and truly come to light \u2014 but is he too far gone for redemption? Is anyone capable of bringing him back from the dark side? Callum (Tony Clay) perhaps? The two passionately kissed after Ben\u2019s antics on the bridge, and it was clear in this scene just how much Ben cares for him.\n\nMum Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) is certainly an option too, or perhaps returnee Pam Coker (Lin Blakley) will have what it takes to get through to him?\n\nEastEnders continues on Monday 28thOctober at 8pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: EastEnders spoilers: Mariam Amhed tries to split up Honey Mitchell and Adam Bateman?\n\nMORE: 10 EastEnders spoilers: Sharon and Mel\u2019s feud reaches new heights, A new romance and a shocking secret revealed\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "After Martin's betrayal, Ben set about getting revenge on the market trader in a well and truly dark fashion.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/martin-fowler-and-ben-mitchell-in-eastenders_1572025537.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
