Jackson was especially good in the second half, when he led Baltimore on a pair of crucial scoring drives.\n\nEarl Thomas made his return to Seattle after nine seasons of playing for the Seahawks, but aside from some occasional barking at the sideline of his former team and running off the field twirling Wilson\u2019s jersey over his head after the victory, the former All-Pro safety ceded the spotlight to Jackson.\n\nThe second-year quarterback ran for an 8-yard touchdown late in the third quarter on fourth-and-2 to give the Ravens (5-2) the lead. On their next possession and backed up deep in their own end, Jackson made a series of highlight plays to drive Baltimore into scoring position for Justin Tucker\u2019s fourth field goal and a 10-point lead with 3:47 left.\n\nJackson had a 30-yard run on third-and-8 from the Ravens 12. He scrambled 13 yards for another first down and hit tight end Nick Boyle for a 20-yard completion to get the Ravens inside the Seattle 10. Baltimore went 86 yards in 13 plays and ate 9 minutes off the clock.\n\nAnd when Wilson finally got the ball back in his hands, the Ravens quickly stretched the lead to 17. DK Metcalf fumbled Wilson\u2019s first pass, and Marlon Humphrey returned it 18 yards for a touchdown, the second defensive TD of the game by Baltimore.\n\nJackson completed just 9 of 20 passes for 143 yards on a cold, wet day in the Pacific Northwest. He was hampered by several drops and could have had an even more dynamic performance running if not for footing problems on the wet turf.\n\nWhile Jackson was great, he was helped by a defense that held Seattle to three points in the second half and capitalized on two turnovers.\n\nWilson was nearly flawless for the first six games but struggled to find open receivers against Baltimore\u2019s physical secondary. Seattle (5-2) was leading 10-6 and driving when Wilson made the mistake of double-clutching and trying to throw late into the flat. Peters, traded to Baltimore less than a week ago, made a quick break on the throw, stepped in front of Jaron Brown and outraced Wilson for his fifth career interception return touchdown, the most of any player since Peters entered the league in 2015.\n\nWilson was 20 of 41 passing for 241 yards and an 8-yard TD in the first quarter to Tyler Lockett.\n\nRETURN OF EARL\n\nThomas had a mostly uneventful return and finished with five tackles. He caught up with a handful of his former teammates before the game and signed a few of his Seahawks jerseys still floating around. He exchanged jerseys with Wilson after the game.\n\nINJURIES\n\nBaltimore defensive end Pernell McPhee suffered an arm injury in the first half and did not return.\n\nMISSING\n\nSeveral key starters were missing for both teams. Seattle was without starting safety Bradley McDougald (back), defensive end Ziggy Ansah (ankle) and left tackle Duane Brown (biceps). McDougald\u2019s absence meant rookie Marquise Blair made his first start and had six tackles.\n\nThe Ravens were without starting wide receiver Marquise Brown and linebacker Patrick Onwuasor, and top cornerback Jimmy Smith. Brown and Onwuasor both have ankle injuries, while Smith has a knee injury.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRavens: After a bye next week, Baltimore will host New England on Nov. 3.\n\nSeahawks: Seattle will travel to Atlanta next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Whether it was scrambling away from trouble or designed runs to use his speed, there was no stopping Lamar Jackson.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/ravens_seahawks_football_37204_c0-203-4877-3047_s1200x700.jpg?005315482a639ada975a20e97d25ee7e65cfe855", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
