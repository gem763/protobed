Shares in another French carmaker, Renault, which was in talks with Fiat earlier this year about a similar deal, slid 3.5%.\n\n\"The deal is geographically complementarily given FCA's strong hold in North America and PSA's footing in Asia and (the) rest of the world,\" Martino De Ambroggi, senior equities analyst at Equita, wrote in a note.\n\nOslo-listed stocks got a boost from a near 2% rise in the world's largest fish farming company Mowi which plans to increase its production by 4.7% in 2020.\n\nAll eyes will move later in the day to the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest announcement on interest rates, widely expected to cut borrowing costs for the third time this year and offer more signals on the path ahead.
