One gunshot in Arizona sparked a massive wildfire. In Iowa, a 56-year-old grandmother-to-be died Saturday when a homemade device, intended to throw coloured powder into the air, exploded.\n\nBut critics are questioning the aim of these parties, saying that they reinforce gender stereotypes and a binary gender identity.\n\n\"I don't think this would have become a trend without social media blogs and YouTube \u2026 sharing is actually part of the ritual,\" Florence Pasche Guignard, philosophy instructor at Ryerson University, told The Current's interim host Laura Lynch.\n\nGuignard has studied the history of gender reveal parties, and says that the spectacle is a product of the times and part of a bigger consumer culture that reinforces gender stereotypes.\n\n\"We'll see what happens in terms of society as more and more people criticize these gender reveal parties. We'll see if trend keeps up, or if people gradually will shift to celebrating something else that is beautiful about pregnancy and becoming parents,\" said Guignard.\n\nElaborate reveals as grand as weddings\n\nIn 2008, Jenna Karvunidis was one of the early adopters of gender reveal parties.\n\nBut after seeing what the parties have become, Karvunidis now regrets contributing to its spread.\n\n\"They've become ever more aggressive and outlandish,\" said Karvunidis.\n\n\"I think it's putting the focus somewhere it doesn't necessarily need to be with a new baby.\"\n\nGlenn Needham, owner of Needham\u2019s Market Garden near Ottawa, fires the \"Pumpkin Modulator\" canon to reveal the sex of Kendra and Brandon Holmes's unborn baby. (Submitted by Kendra Holmes and Brandon Holmes.)\n\nOne father, Jon Reilly, co-founded a business in 2015 selling gender reveal-tailored party products missing then from the market.\n\nReilly said that his business, Poof There It Is!, provides expecting parents the power to do whatever they want.\n\n\"We had one client that purchased 100 cannons and she goes, 'There's been two events in my life that I've dreamed of, and that was getting married and having kids. How much did I spend for my wedding? I assume I'm going to spend the same for when I'm announcing the birth of my children.'\"\n\nGender versus sex\n\nGuignard questions calling them \"gender reveal\" parties.\n\n\"What is really revealed through the ultrasound is fetal sex,\" said Guignard. \"So it's not the gender of a baby. These parties tend to conflate sex with gender.\"\n\nKarvunidis is concerned that the trend she contributed to is harming young children, transgender and non-binary people.\n\n\"Right out of the gate, [children] walk into a world that's been pinkwashed for them,\" said Karvunidis.\n\n\"They've walked into an expectation. You're really limiting who they can be.\"\n\nShe sees potential for lots of other celebrations, such as name reveal parties, that may sidestep prickly or controversial gender conversations.\n\nThank you, yes I \"invented\" the gender reveal in July 2008 and it was picked up in Bump Magazine and kinda spread from there. I've felt major mixed feelings about my contribution to the culture. PLOT TWIST: The world's first gender-revealed baby girl wears suits!
