Today, a new challenger appeared: the nonprofit organization Fight for the Future, which has spun up a campaign called Gamers for Freedom to put pressure on Blizzard to reevaluate its stances on China and Hong Kong.\n\nFight for the Future organizes online (and in-person) campaigns to, as they write in their mission statement, \u201censure that the web continues to hold freedom of expression and creativity at its core.\u201d (They were the ones who mobilized basically the entire internet against SOPA and PIPA in 2012.) For this latest battle, the org has planned two actions, one online and one IRL. Next week, they\u2019re organizing an \u201conline day of action for free expression,\u201d which will \u201cdemand that gaming companies make a public statement supporting basic rights in their games and on their platforms.\u201d\n\nWhile they don\u2019t exactly make it clear what \u201cbasic rights\u201d means, I suspect it has something to do with Blizzard\u2019s commitment to not rocking China\u2019s boat as it regards the protests in Hong Kong. They outline five steps: signing a petition; contacting gamers, streamers, and YouTubers on a list that currently redirects to a Google Spreadsheet with more instructions on how to get involved; pressing game developers to have a stance on the issue; tweeting, so your friends know where you stand; and lastly creating fan art or cosplay depicting a character from a video game protesting for Hong Kong.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong are deadly serious\n\nOn Friday, November 1st, Gamers for Freedom is organizing a protest at BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard\u2019s biggest event of the year \u2014 it\u2019s when fans from around the world show up to a convention center to hear the company\u2019s latest announcements. The Facebook event is more explicit about Gamers for Freedom\u2019s goals because it spells out the connection between the protest action and Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung\u2019s ban from Hearthstone. Recall: he was banned by Blizzard for speaking up about Hong Kong, and advises participants to \u201cbring an umbrella\u201d \u2014 a callback to Hong Kong\u2019s 2014 Umbrella Movement \u2014 \u201cand join other gamers [as] we show our support for free speech and free expression.\u201d At the time of this writing, 84 people have marked themselves as \u201cgoing.\u201d\n\nWhile identifying as a \u201cgamer\u201d is a little cringeworthy \u2014 and more than a little reminiscent of Gamergate, which the movement\u2019s organizing tactics echo by uniting under that banner \u2014 the protests in Hong Kong are deadly serious. The territory really is fighting for democracy and freedom from Chinese meddling. It remains to be seen what\u2019ll happen, both online and at BlizzCon.\n\nFor now, Gamers for Freedom has a Discord, a running list of game publishers with their views on Hong Kong appended, and a list of \u201cmore ethical\u201d games to play that aren\u2019t Blizzard\u2019s. That language is similar to what gamers said during Gamergate \u2014 it was ostensibly about \u201cethics in games journalism,\u201d which was not the case \u2014 and they used the same kind of targeting to get companies to accede to their demands. This, obviously, is very different; Hong Kong is fighting for its right to self-determination. And this probably won\u2019t end in a bunch of people harassed off the internet for the crime of being female.", "description": "For this latest battle, Fight for the Future has spun up a campaign called Gamers for Freedom, in the mold of its previous efforts. If the org\u2019s previous endeavors are any indication, it seems like Gamers for Freedom will put real pressure on Blizzard to reevaluate its stances on China and Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Bijan Stephen", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HpEdL_I7Qj1lRgYm7YYwcFNdhKE=/0x383:6168x3612/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19316784/1020639442.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
