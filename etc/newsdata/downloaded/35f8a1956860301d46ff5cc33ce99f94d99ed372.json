A fresh start \u2014 and a delightful one, run by an enthusiastic young team who seem determined to blow away any cobwebs from the previous regime.\n\nThere are eight rooms, six above the 17th-century inn and two round the back in an attractive paved garden.\n\nRooms are small but there\u2019s not much anyone can do about it in such a higgledy-piggledy old boozer with low ceilings, exposed beams and flagstone floors.\n\nAnd although space might be tight in the bedrooms, there are plenty of cosy nooks downstairs for romantic liaisons in front of two open fires.\n\nHighclere Castle (of Downton Abbey fame) is just up the road, which surely will be good for business, and there are fabulous walks nearby.\n\nThe menu bounces along in traditional gastro-pub style, with starters from \u00a33.50 for a terrific Scotch egg to crab cakes for \u00a38.\n\nThe dining room in the traditional gastro-pub style, where there are starters from \u00a33.50 for a terrific Scotch egg to crab cakes for \u00a38\n\nMain courses are divided into \u2018pub favourites\u2019 such as posh fish and chips (\u00a313) and pie and mash (\u00a311), and the \u2018grill\u2019 offers an 8oz rib eye for \u00a318 and half a lobster for \u00a322.\n\nI daresay prices will rise once the new team gets into the pricey Hampshire spirit but, right now, \u00a380 or so for bed and breakfast is good value.\n\nBreakfast is generous, too. I down three double espressos to get the engine started but am only charged for one. We hope this pheasant will fly for years to come.", "description": "The Pheasant is a pub with eight rooms. The Inspector checked in to find it is run by an 'enthusiastic young team'. He also approved of the menu. Starters cost from \u00a33.50 and a 'terrific' Scotch eggs costs \u00a38.", "authors": ["The Inspector"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/19/19020724-0-image-a-66_1569607347528.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
