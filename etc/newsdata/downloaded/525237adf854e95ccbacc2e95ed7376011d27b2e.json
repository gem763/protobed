(Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows)\n\nJustin Bieber said in a candid Instagram post Sunday that he isolated himself and turned to \u201cheavy drugs\u201d at 19 while struggling to cope with his rapid rise to fame.\n\nThe 25-year-old pop star has become increasingly open about his personal life in recent years as he has rebounded from a string of missteps \u2014 including a 2014 DUI arrest \u2014 that led to concerns about his career. Last year, he shocked fans (and pop culture writers) when he took to Instagram to confirm his engagement to model Hailey Baldwin, whom he married two months later. On Sunday, Bieber referenced their marriage as \u201cthe best season of my life.\u201d\n\nHe put their union in stark contrast to the relationships he \u201cabused\u201d as he grappled with the dark side of fame. \u201cI Became resentful, disrespectful to women, and angry,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI became distant to everyone who loved me, and i was hiding behind, a shell of a person that I had become.\u201d\n\nBieber skyrocketed to fame at 13 when a little-known talent manager named Scooter Braun stumbled across YouTube videos of the baby-faced Ontario native crooning R&B hits. He certainly isn\u2019t the first child star to struggle with fame or sudden wealth \u2014 a theme to which Bieber alluded in his post. \u201cHave u noticed the statistics of child stars and the outcome of their life?\u201d he asked. \u201cThere is an insane amount of pressure and responsibility put on a child who\u2019s brain, emotions, frontal lobes (decision making) aren\u2019t developed yet.\u201d\n\nStill, Bieber faced a unique hurdle as part of an early generation of celebrities who grew up in the social media era. That has made the singer and his peers (including his famous, social-media-wary ex, Selena Gomez) more accessible to fans \u2014 and criticism.\n\nBut social media has also allowed celebrities to confront everything from rumors to harsh truths on their own terms. Bieber\u2019s post prompted messages of support from several fellow celebrities, including singer Sean Kingston, actor-model Patrick Schwarzenegger, reality star Khloe Kardashian and Braun, who simply wrote: \u201cProud of you.\u201d\n\n[Celebrities get slammed for everything online \u2014 even how they grieve]\n\nLiam Payne, who rose to fame in the British boy band One Direction, seemed particularly moved by Bieber\u2019s forthrightness, and disappointed that many headlines focused on the singer\u2019s admitted drug use. \u201cI think what you did yesterday was incredibly brave and you deserve a little more respect,\u201d Payne tweeted, using Bieber\u2019s handle.\n\nBieber\u2019s reference to \u201cheavy drugs\u201d was jarring, but it\u2019s not the first time the singer has broached the subject. He told Vogue earlier this year that he used Xanax to mask his shame during his lowest points. \u201cDrugs put a screen between me and what I was doing. It got pretty dark,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cI think there were times when my security was coming in late at night to check my pulse and see if I was still breathing.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his marriage, Bieber has cast his Christian faith as a pivotal aspect of his healing. It\u2019s something he and Baldwin share: The couple, who dated briefly in 2015, reunited last year after running into each other at a Miami conference hosted by Kardashian-favorite pastor Rich Wilkerson Jr.\n\n\u201cJesus loves you,\u201d Bieber wrote near the end of his lengthy post, which he summarized as a reminder to \u201ckeep fighting\u201d even when \u201cthe odds are against you.\u201d\n\nBieber\u2019s frank discussions about fame and mental-health struggles are particularly notable because they seem to be unfolding in real time.\n\nLast week, People reported that he cried while singing Marvin Sapp\u2019s chart-topping gospel song \u201cNever Would Have Made It\u201d at Churchome Beverly Hills. Bieber, whose song \u201cI Don\u2019t Care\u201d with collaborator Ed Sheeran sits in the Top 10 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, later documented the emotional performance on Instagram.\n\n\u201cGod is pulling me through a hard season,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe quiet brilliance of Kenan Thompson, SNL\u2019s longest-tenured cast member\n\nJohn Travolta is in the Rotten Tomatoes clunker, \u2018no regrets\u2019 stage of his career \u2014 and is enjoying every minute of it\n\nHow Rosal\u00eda brought flamenco to the VMAs \u2014 and into the genre-bending world of modern pop", "description": "The pop star continued to get honest about his adolescent struggles in a recent Instagram post.", "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
