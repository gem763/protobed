Give us a system where our vote counts.\n\nThis will be the first federal election I'm eligible to vote in. My riding is solidly Conservative. Based on polling, history and the current state of the NDP, I would bet money that my riding will still be Conservative after election day.\n\nSo what is the point in even voting?\n\nMany of my friends echo this sentiment.\n\nI truly believe that my vote does not matter under our first-past-the-post (FPTP) system, in which I only vote for one MP. The MP who wins has the same authority whether they win by one vote or 10,000.\n\nSince it is a winner-take-all-system, a candidate can become your MP with 30 per cent of the vote, leaving 70 per cent of voters in a riding feeling as though their voices don't matter.\n\nOne of the most important things for my generation is a politician who sticks to their word. - Andrew Batycki\n\nJustin Trudeau got 39.5 per cent of the popular vote, received 54 per cent of the seats and now has 100 per cent of the power.\n\nBefore Trudeau was elected as prime minister, he stated that 2015 would be the last election under FPTP. This was incredibly exciting to hear. My first-ever vote would be under a new system, one where I made a difference even if I wasn't voting for the dominant candidate.\n\nYou probably know Trudeau did not follow through on that promise. This is incredibly frustrating, but sadly not surprising.\n\nTrudeau was able to renege on his promise because FPTP empowers him to do so. I don't know about you, but I'm not excited to vote when our government can't be held accountable for breaking promises.\n\nForce politicians to work together\n\nOne thing that I believe could both help hold politicians accountable and increase voter turnout among young people is a shift to proportional representation.\n\nUnder this system, MPs in different regions would be assigned based on the percentage of support each party gets. This helps ensure the number of seats a party gets directly corresponds to how many people who voted for it.\n\nThis system would also force parties to work together to pass legislation, as it would be much harder to get a majority.\n\nYou might be thinking this all sounds a little idealistic and that politicians will be politicians no matter how they are elected. There's probably a degree of truth to that statement, but I truly believe we would see a more responsible government if we had a system that forces politicians to work together.\n\nFrom what I've seen, one of the most important things for my generation is a politician who sticks to their word. There's not a doubt in my mind that a system that holds them to account and gives us the ability to truly elect who we want would increase voter turnout among young people.\n\nThis column is part of CBC's Opinion section.
