But stormquakes are something new.\n\n\u201cThere's a low hum in the Earth called the microseism that's happening all the time generated by the action of wind and waves around the world drumming on the seafloor,\u201d said Wendy Bohon, geologist and science communication specialist at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology. The very biggest storms drum on the ocean floor with even more energy, creating stormquakes, a newly-discovered phenomena announced this week in an article published in Geophysical Research Letters.\n\n\u201c[Stormquakes] are seismic activity that can travel across the continent that are excited by hurricanes and large winter storms,\u201d Catherine de Groot-Hedlin, geophysicist at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography involved in the research, said.\n\nUnlike the background microseism hum, stormquakes are localized point sources that only show up in certain areas. While the phenomena is so newly-recognized that scientists aren\u2019t entirely sure of the mechanisms yet, they have determined that stormquakes occur along technically passive margins\u2014places that don\u2019t get earthquakes\u2014on broad, large continental shelves.\n\n\u201cIt's something about the shape\u2014or the bathymetry\u2014of the seafloor interacting with these big ocean waves that are produced during storms,\u201d Bohon said. \u201cYou're getting some kind of energy relief that's beating on the seafloor in a particular way, and those waves are moving out in all directions as coherent packages which we\u2019re then able to detect using seismometers.\u201d\n\nImage: Geophysical Research Letters\n\nWith ocean waves all over the world drumming on the ground, the microseism is a mess of incoherent waves, the seismic equivalent of tossing a handful of gravel into a pond and the myriad of many-sized ripples spilling out in all direction. But, Bohon explains, these stormquakes are creating coherent seismic waves that are more like tossing a single pebble into a pond to create clean, coordinated ripples radiating from a single source.\n\nStormquakes were discovered by adapting a tool originally used to search for a totally different type of geophysical signal.\n\n\u201cI developed it for infrasound, which is sound waves travelling through the air,\u201d de Groot-Hedlin said. One of her co-authors, Sloan Coats, noticed an unusual seismic pattern in the extremely seismically-active Cascadia Subduction Zone of the Pacific Northwest, and asked de Groot-Hedlin to modify her algorithms. \u201cThe amplitude are much lower than what we're used to seeing with earthquakes normally,\u201d explains de Groot-Hedlin, but once they saw it, they were able to apply the same technique to other locations and soon realized it was storms, not tectonic movement, that was triggering the stormquakes.\n\nSeismic waves generated by earthquakes, explosions, and now, apparently, storms, can be used to map what\u2019s underground by carefully measuring when seismic waves arrive at different places on the planet. Different types of seismic waves each have different characteristics that interact in specific ways with the materials they pass through. \u201cThat gives us an idea of what's happening in the subsurface, both the wave speed, the way the waves change and when the waves stop,\u201d says Bohon.\n\nOne of the fundamental assumptions of using background seismic waves like the microseism to map subsurface structures is that they are incoherent\u2014it\u2019s random noise from all directions. \u201cThat\u2019s an incorrect assumption,\u201d de Groot-Hedlin said, pointing out that since stormquakes only happen in particular places, they aren\u2019t random. While stormquakes won\u2019t directly lead to better seismic imaging of the Earth\u2019s interior, it will lead to researchers questioning what we think we know so far.\n\n\u201cWe can use seismometers to learn a whole lot more than just about earthquakes,\u201d Bohon said. Geophysics is a science of indirection and creativity. \u201cA lot of the things that we're looking for, we can't directly observe, so we have to think of other ways to look at them.\u201d\n\nSeismometers can even be used to study atmospheric phenomena. \u201cThere's a slight tilt in the seismometers before a tornado touches down,\u201d Bohon said. These stormquakes are another tool for geophysicists to deploy, and both Bohon and de Groot-Hedlin agree the most exciting part will be the unexpected interdisciplinary collaborations neither of them have even thought of yet.\n\n\u201cNoise means whatever you're not interested in,\u201d said de Groot-Hedlin, who is already adapting her search algorithms to listen to breaking ice, fracking, and even nuclear explosions.\n\n\u201cThey found these signals and they've come up with this idea that's supported by evidence,\u201d Bohon said. \u201cBut now other scientists from other fields are going to be able to use and run with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you're kids, you feel like everything's been discovered. You read textbooks and it's just a bunch of facts,\u201d she added. \u201cWe don't know everything there is to know. We know a lot, but we don't know everything,\u201d", "description": "Some powerful storms are so intense that they literally shake the ocean floor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9bc4c3116b2000a62ee0c/lede/1571405189757-Screen-Shot-2019-10-18-at-92557-AM.png?crop=1xw:0.8384279475982532xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
