Do we have to go there? Apparently so\u2026 #sigh.\n\nProcter & Gamble is the parent company that produces the Always brand line of feminine hygiene products. (You\u2019ve probably seen the advertisements on television, even if you\u2019re a dude.) Some of their packaging for sanitary napkins includes a \u201cvenus\u201d symbol of femininity. It\u2019s the one with what appears to be a cross with a circle on top, frequently seen on some women\u2019s restroom doors. And considering the nature of the product (based on what very little I know of the subject) that\u2019s probably not surprising, right?\n\nPerhaps not surprising, but still offensive apparently. At least to some in the transgender community who insist that there are still \u201cmen\u201d out there who use these products. You know\u2026 because they were born as women and need them. So outraged complaints were hurled on social media. To make a long and uncomfortable story short, P&G caved almost immediately and will be removing the symbol from their packaging. (Daily Mail)\n\nThe maker of Always sanitary pads has given in to claims of discrimination by transgender men and removed the \u2018Venus\u2019 symbol of the female sex from the wrapping. Outraged women are now boycotting the leading brand after the decision by makers Procter & Gamble (P&G) to kowtow to trans activists who were born female and still use sanitary products. Last night, feminists warned that the concession is a chilling move towards the \u2018elimination of women\u2019s biology\u2019.\n\nSo it\u2019s come to this. A leading manufacturer of feminine hygiene products is taking the symbol for females off its packaging. Just let that sink in for a moment. The trans mafia has basically declared war on common sense.\n\nTo add even more spice for the goose, there is now an online battle raging in England between feminists (actual women) and trans activists. One \u201cradical feminist writer,\u201d Julie Bindel, issued the following statement: \u201cRemoving the female symbol from sanitary towel packaging is basically denying the existence of women. We\u2019re now moving towards the total elimination of women\u2019s biology. The women\u2019s symbol has been used by feminists for decades. This is pure cowardice and virtue signaling from these big corporate brands who are capitulating to the trans agenda.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t appear that P&G is going to back down from caving in, however. I checked on their web page for these particular products (an internet journey I had never anticipated taking and which might require some sort of trigger warning for some of the guys in the audience) and found no sign of the Venus symbol anywhere to be seen.\n\nLet me guess. Are we now going to have a Supreme Court case looming on the horizon over this? We\u2019re already tying up the courts over questions of trans athletes wrecking competitive women\u2019s sports and whether or not \u201cwomen with penises\u201d should use one bathroom or the other. So what the heck. We might as well kick one off over feminine hygiene products too.
