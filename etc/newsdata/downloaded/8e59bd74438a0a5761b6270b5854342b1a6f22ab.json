The rest would be utility-scale solar farms. The number of solar rooftop systems on homes is expected to double to 100 million by 2024.\n\nOverall, the report said, renewable energy\u2019s share of the power mix is expected to increase from 26 percent to 30 percent \u2014 due partly to rapid expansion in the European Union, strong growth in India and an \u201cinstallation boom in Vietnam.\n\n\u201cRenewables are already the world\u2019s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,\u201d IEA Executive Director Faith Birol said.\n\n\u201cAs costs continue to fall, we have a growing incentive to ramp up the deployment of solar [photovoltaic].\u201d", "description": "Oct. 21 (UPI) \u2014 The world\u2019s renewable energy capacity will increase by 50 percent within the next five years, as prices drop and government", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
