(John McDonnell/The Washington Post via Getty)\n\nDown by two runs in the eighth inning with two outs on the board, 20-year-old Juan Soto delivered for the Washingon Nationals in the NL wild-card game Tuesday night.\n\nThe second-year player stepped to the plate against Milwaukee closer Josh Hader and hit a bases-loaded single that scored three runs and put Washington up 4-3 over the Brewers, a lead they would not relinquish.\n\nSoto made solid contact with the ball, but he likely would not have given Washington the lead had it not been for an error by rookie outfielder Trent Grisham.\n\nJuan Soto was 0-3 before giving the Nationals their 4-3 lead and the win.

Drew Pomeranz gave way to Hader to start the eighth in what seemed to be an ideal turn of events for the Brew Crew.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have drawn it up any better,\u201d manager Craig Counsell said later. \u201cIt went the way we wanted.\u201d\n\nBut, Washington did not relent and the Nationals now carry a nine-game winning streak into their best-of-five NL Division Series against the league-best Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The Associated Press", "description": "Juan Soto stepped to the plate against closer Josh Hader and hit a\u00a0bases-loaded single that scored three runs and put Washington up 4-3 over the Brewers.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173047434-e1570020684406.jpg?fit=860%2C573"}
