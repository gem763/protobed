The dress was one of his favorite designs he created before his death on April 2 at age 56. To pay homage to the celeb-loved tailor, Jolie decided to wear one of his design while in the Italian city of Rome.\n\nZahara also wore a dress by the brand, a green ombr\u00e9 halter gown, and wore her hair in its natural, curly hair texture.\n\nErnesto S. Ruscio/Getty More\n\nShiloh coordinated in a similar color palette with a metallic embellished bomber jacket teamed with matching trousers and Converse sneakers.\n\nZahara, who was adopted by Jolie from Ethiopia in 2005, is just one of many public figures raising awareness and spreading empowerment about embracing natural hairstyles.\n\nTelevision producer Shonda Rhimes, the Dove Self-Esteem Project and the CROWN Coalition (created by Dove in partnership with the National Urban League, Color of Change, and Western Center on Law and Poverty) recently hosted a workshop on hair discrimination. According to Fashionista, the discussion focused all the ways hair, specifically African-American hair, has \u201cbeen unfairly policed instead of widely celebrated for its beauty.\u201d\n\nAnd a bigger movement has been gaining traction in the state of California. In July, California was the first state to ban racial discrimination against people based on their natural hairstyle when Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Crown Act bill into law. According to The New York Times, this bill is designed to update the definition of race in existing law. Now, it will be inclusive of \u201ctraits historically associated with race, including, but not limited to, hair texture and protective hairstyles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a society in which hair has historically been one of many determining factors of a person\u2019s race, and whether they were a second-class citizen, hair today remains a proxy for race,\u201d the bill says, according to the NYT. \u201cTherefore, hair discrimination targeting hairstyles associated with race is racial discrimination.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s other five children, with her ex-husband Brad Pitt, also accompanied her to the film\u2019s previous premieres. In Los Angeles, she was joined by Knox, 11, Zahara, 14, Pax, 15, Vivienne, 11, and Shiloh, 13, who all posed for photos on the carpet with their mom.", "description": "Angelina Jolie's Daughter Zahara Wears Her Natural Curls at the Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Rome Premiere", "authors": ["Colleen Kratofil"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CYyGZrGflNIcXmDVzLdtKw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/26d1d351669104ba3e7cd9e317d1d123", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
