At the embargoed press conference two hours before he took to the podium in the National Assembly, he treated journalists to some economic straight-talking they hadn't seen or heard in ages.\n\nHe spoke of government having reached a crucial turning point and of difficult decisions that can't be put off any longer. He crucified Eskom for being the single biggest danger to the fiscus and national economic stability and he openly and honestly questioned the value of a national airline. The impossibly high public sector wage bill was unsustainable, he said, and extolled the value of private equity partners in failing state-owned companies.\n\nMboweni unrestrained was \u2013 and remains \u2013 quite a sight.\n\nREAD: Mboweni's medium-term budget in a nutshell\n\nThe consensus in October 2018 was that he was exactly the type of minister President Cyril Ramaphosa needed and that, in tandem with Pravin Gordhan at the department of public enterprises, they might just be the duo that could right the ship of state.\n\nMboweni, after all, doesn't have to worry about a political constituency (his ego is a big enough constituency and needs constant attention), he doesn't need the money and he doesn't want to be president. He can actually do the dirty and get the job done. He is unencumbered by the constraints of ANC palace politics and the stifling of lateral thought induced by alliance contestation.\n\nThe theory went that with Ramaphosa's political protection and support, Mboweni and Gordhan can break some bones and forge on into a brave new post state capture world, clearing the decks and making sober economic decisions.\n\nThis theme \u2013 and the same determined rhetoric by Mboweni \u2013 continued in February when he tabled the budget proper: Eskom is a danger, the public sector wage bill is too high, and we can't continue down the same road any longer.\n\nOn Wednesday South Africans got more of the same, but in the year that's elapsed since Mboweni's maiden appearance tabling a policy document in Parliament, not a lot has changed.\n\nHis speech in the National Assembly, his press conference and National Treasury's (excellent) budget policy book tell the exact same story he told South Africa in February and last October.\n\nTreasury's diagnosis of the country's structural economic dilemmas is spot on.\n\nEskom remains the economy's biggest threat, the public sector wage bill is astronomical (for every R1 000 spent by government, R340 goes to paying civil servants), GDP growth is tepid and deteriorating, the debt-to-GDP ratio is ballooning, the budget deficit is increasing and expenditure on debt repayments is the single fastest growing line item in the budget.\n\nREAD: Party almost over for government's 29 000 millionaires, Mboweni warns\n\nBut Mboweni and Treasury, and presumably Ramaphosa, also knew this a year ago. And both Mboweni and Treasury admit that, as far as Eskom is concerned, progress in its unbundling \"has been limited\". And still there's no clear plan on restructuring its crippling debt.\n\nThe budget policy book is laced with phrases and language which seems very close to admitting defeat in government's efforts to save the country from a very precarious position: \"We have not moved as rapidly \u2026 urgent action needed \u2026 (progress) mostly unrealised \u2026 significant decline \u2026 modest employment \u2026 gradual recovery \u2026 risk skewed to the downside ... \"\n\nSouth Africa was in a dangerous place in February, and things have deteriorated considerably.\n\nBoth Mboweni and the group of excellent bureaucrats at 40 Church Square in Pretoria \u2013 as well as the SA Reserve Bank and SA Revenue Service \u2013 know exactly what needs to be done.\n\nA profligate state needs to be reined in urgently and non-core public assets must be sold off. The private sector also needs to be invited to invest in and own public goods and services, such as harbours and energy generation.\n\nBut in the year that's passed since his first Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement Mboweni's worst fears before he came into the job \u2013 red tape and political quicksand \u2013 have come to pass.\n\nAlmost every single one of the most urgent structural reforms are absolute anathema to ANC policy.\n\nThe culling of an ineffective public sector, selling of state assets and the introduction of (limited) private equity haven't managed to gain traction in the new dawn. Government and ANC gridlock has meant we've sunk even further into the morass of inefficiency. Nothing is getting done, political decisions take precedent over sound economic policy and fears over infighting restrains urgency.\n\n\"Options to stabilise the fiscus are limited \u2026 revenue options are constrained,\" Treasury declares, and adds that recovery is possible if reforms are \"enacted with speed and determination\".\n\nWhen, during the press conference, Mboweni was asked whether the fact that his message hasn't changed in 12 months means he has admitted defeat, he replied: \"We don't admit defeat, Mbowenis don't easily admit defeat \u2026 we trudge on, we keep walking on.\"\n\nSouth Africa has been trudging along for far too long, Sir.", "description": "Despite Tito Mboweni's plans for the economy, nothing is getting done, political decisions take precedent over sound economic policy and fears over infighting restrains urgency, writes Pieter du Toit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8941/6c295d315c9747b9a913d87a752b98ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
