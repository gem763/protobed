Gorsuch, sided with the liberal wing of the court in divided rulings more than any other Republican-appointed justice during the 2018 term. But don\u2019t mistake him for a swing vote.\n\nCourt watchers say he aligns with the more liberal side of the court on only a few legal cases dealing with criminal law and tribal issues.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s pretty predictable,\u201d said Adam Feldman, founder of the Empirical SCOTUS blog. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like [the late Justice Antonin] Scalia was predictable in some areas.\u201d\n\nJustice Gorsuch accounted for four of the 10 times a justice from the conservative wing of the court crossed over to vote with Democrat-appointed justices in 5-4 decisions last year.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sided with the liberal wing three times, and the other three Republican-appointed justices swung to the left only once.\n\nBut Justice Gorsuch\u2019s four tiebreakers didn\u2019t signal to court watchers that he is necessarily representing the bench\u2019s middle ground in all disputes.\n\n\u201cGorsuch is far too conservative to be seen as a reliable swing vote for the liberals. This is clear in his method of interpretation favoring originalism,\u201d Mr. Feldman said.\n\n\u201cI see a blatant demarcation between a justice that swings in a few particular case areas and justices like Kennedy and O\u2019Connor who, though conservative, would often split their votes in both directions in the court\u2019s closest decisions.\u201d\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy was considered the court\u2019s \u201cswing vote\u201d after Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor retired in 2006, but he rejected that term.\n\n\u201cThe cases swing; I don\u2019t,\u201d Justice Kennedy said during a 2015 appearance.\n\nWith nine justices on the high court, there has almost always been one nicknamed the \u201cswingman\u201d or \u201cswing vote,\u201d which signals who could be the one to decide a tight case.\n\nJustice Kennedy voted with the conservative bloc in 64% of cases from 2006 to 2017, a more than 10% drop after Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s retirement, according to a FiveThirtyEight report after his retirement last year. The legal areas where he tended to sway to the left involved civil rights, criminal law and due process.\n\nBut Justice Gorsuch tends to vote with the liberal side of the court on cases interpreting criminal statutes and tribal matters.\n\nJosh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, said the disputes don\u2019t always \u201cfit a neat right-left divide.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s 2019 docket doesn\u2019t have any tribal disputes, and there doesn\u2019t appear to be a number of criminal cases that court watchers say could lead Justice Gorsuch to cross over.\n\n\u201cIn terms of ones that are expected to be 5-to-4 with Gorsuch as the one joining the liberals, there are two fairly high-profile criminal cases coming up in the October sitting,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, editor of the Cato Institute\u2019s Supreme Court Review.\n\nMr. Shapiro said Justice Gorsuch\u2019s votes in criminal matters tend to parallel those of his predecessor, Justice Scalia, who died in 2016.\n\n\u201cMy impression is that they\u2019re identical. And that goes for the types of criminal cases where they\u2019re with conservatives, like in death penalty cases,\u201d said Mr. Shapiro, noting that challenges to executions are different from questions of whether a law is too vague to pass constitutional scrutiny.\n\nAdvocacy groups, though, are hoping Justice Gorsuch \u2014 or another Republican-appointed justice \u2014 will align with Justice Scalia\u2019s reasoning in a prominent LGBTQ case to be heard Tuesday.\n\nThe legal battle is over the definition of \u201csex\u201d under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Advocacy groups have filed briefs trying to sway some of the Republican-appointed justices to the liberal side of the court by arguing that \u201csex\u201d includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nSeveral of the briefs have turned to Justice Scalia\u2019s opinion in a unanimous ruling in a 1998 case that said Title VII protected a male employee from sexual harassment from someone of the same gender, Mr. Blackman said. The briefs say the opinion provides the Republican-appointed justices with a standard in ruling for the LGBTQ plaintiffs, who said they were fired from their jobs based on their sexual orientation or based on being transgender.\n\n\u201cThey no doubt hope that Gorsuch will find these textualist arguments persuasive,\u201d Mr. Blackman said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
