The lyrical film, chronicling Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion, had landed at just the right time\u2014in the midst of #OscarsSoWhite, a controversy stemming from the fact that all 20 acting nominees at the Academy Awards that year were white. After a heated bidding war, it was acquired by Fox Searchlight for $17.5 million, making it the priciest acquisition in Sundance history, and looked poised for an awards run.\n\nThen, in the months prior to its release, writer/director/producer/star Nate Parker\u2019s past rape allegation resurfaced.\n\nIn 1999, while a student on a wrestling scholarship at Penn State University, Parker and his best friend, Jean Celestin\u2014a co-writer on The Birth of a Nation\u2014were accused of raping a young white woman on campus, as well as subsequently launching a harassment campaign against her that ultimately forced her to switch schools. A jury acquitted Parker, but Celestin was found guilty and sentenced to six months to a year in jail. When the judge deemed that sentence \u201ctoo lenient,\u201d Celestin was sentenced to an additional two to four years behind bars\u2014upon being granted a second trial, however, prosecutors declined to retry the case, and he was set free.\n\nParker and Celestin\u2019s accuser wasn\u2019t so lucky. She dropped out of school, and her mental health gradually deteriorated until, in April 2012, she took her own life.\n\nDuring the press tour for The Birth of a Nation, Parker was criticized for a perceived coldness and lack of remorse concerning the woman and her allegation\u2014so much so that the producers of the film had to hire several firms to give him media training\u2014and the film took in just under $16 million at the box office while receiving no major awards attention.\n\nThree years later, Parker is back with his sophomore feature American Skin, which debuts Sept. 1 at the Venice Film Festival. The film, written, directed by, and starring Parker, centers on Lincoln Jefferson (Parker), a Marine veteran who, after his 14-year-old son is executed by a white police officer during a traffic stop, and after no charges are filed against the cop, holds the entire precinct hostage in his quest for justice.\n\nAmerican Skin\u2014which currently lacks a U.S. distributor\u2014was a late addition to the festival lineup, and on Sunday afternoon, a last-minute press conference was held for the film featuring Parker, producers Mark Burg and Tarak Ben Ammar, and Spike Lee, who is given a \u201cpresented by\u201d credit on the project.\n\nAt the presser, Parker\u2014whose facility with the media has clearly improved since 2016, with the actor bursting into tears on several seemingly-at-random occasions\u2014immediately addressed the controversy surrounding the rape allegation and his response.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot in the last three years. It\u2019s been a journey of wisdom\u2014talking to people who are important to me, asking their advice, getting their support and learning more about myself, being introspective about the last three years, and I\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d said Parker. \u201cStanding here at 39, the reality is I was quite tone-deaf to a lot of the things around in the climate, and my response during that time obviously hurt a lot of people, and frustrated and angered a lot of people, and I apologize to them. I\u2019m still learning, and growing, and still feeling the need to make films that I think speak to things that need to change in our country, and the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to piggyback on my brother Nate,\u201d chimed in Spike Lee. \u201cI know it was troubled times\u2014we had not spoken in a while\u2014and Nate called me up, he said, \u2018Spike I\u2019ve got a film, I want to show it to you, I\u2019ll come to New York\u2019\u2026So Nate came to New York and screened it for me, and this film affected me\u2026there hasn\u2019t been a film that\u2019s affected me this deeply in a while. And I said, \u2018Nate, if I could help you, tell me what to do.\u2019 And Nate and I also had a private conversation because I had to see where his head was too, because it was no joke what he had to go through. It was a man-to-man, a black man-a black man, brother-to-brother, friend-to-friend talk. There\u2019s an expression, it was \u2018100,\u2019 meaning legit. All the way \u2018100.\u2019 And I said, let\u2019s go. I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d spoken to Lee about the Parker controversy in 2017, and he communicated how he believed there was a double standard in the way Parker and Casey Affleck, who settled a pair of sexual-harassment suits, were treated\u2014with The Birth of Nation being shut out of the Oscars, and Affleck winning the Best Actor Oscar. \u201c[Casey Affleck] settled several times. I don\u2019t know the exact details of it. One day, someone\u2019s going to write a book about that whole thing, because I\u2019ve never seen someone fall so quick,\u201d said Lee. He also accused the media of \u201cshenanigans\u201d in pursuing the Parker story, and insinuated that a rival producer tipped off the press to the case in order to knock it out of the Oscar race.\n\nWhen I asked Lee in Venice about why he decided to go to bat for Parker and put his name on American Skin, and also how he felt Parker was treated, he seemed a bit more diplomatic. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s move forward. Nate is in here, he\u2019s not hiding, he\u2019s answered all questions, and we\u2019ve got to move forward. That\u2019s how I feel. It\u2019s fruitless for me to say, this happened to Nate and this happened to other people. Can\u2019t do that. This is only Nate\u2019s second feature film. He has a lot more in him. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d", "description": "The Oscar-winning filmmaker was on hand to present Parker\u2019s new film \u201cAmerican Skin,\u201d his first since a rape allegation against him resurfaced in 2016.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567350906/190901-stern-nate-parker-tease_v2ctro"}
