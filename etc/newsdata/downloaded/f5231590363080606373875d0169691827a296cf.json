REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wow\n\nSet in 1981, Hermanus\u2019 drama, provocatively called \u201cMoffie\u201d a derogatory slang term for being gay, shows a group of white teenage boys called to complete their two years\u2019 compulsory military service.\n\nAfter a brutal training regime they are sent to fight on the frontline in a border dispute with Angola.\n\nHermanus tells the story of young white men struggling emotionally and physically to deal with army life.\n\n\u201cThis film is challenging in a way because 25 years later after the end of apartheid, I have chosen to make a film that tries to explore the trauma of white teenagers,\u201d Hermanus told Reuters after his film screened at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nThe film follows 18-year-old Nicholas who not only has army life to contend with but is also coming to terms with his sexuality and feelings he develops for a male soldier.\n\nHermanus is unsure how the film will be received in South Africa where he says \u201cmoffie\u201d is still a slur used in newspaper headlines but he hopes the film can help bring about cohesion.\n\n\u201cI would like the conversation to be about the trauma that toxic masculinity that we need to address in South Africa, I would like it to be about the treatment of the LGBT community and I hope with any film that I make about South Africa ... that it expands our understanding of each other,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile South Africa is the only African country to have legalised same-sex marriage, Hermanus said the LGBT community \u201cis still struggling to be heard, still experiencing horrific, horrific abuse and shaming\u201d.\n\nKai Luke Brummer who plays Nicholas said his father went into to the army and had never spoken about the experience until Brummer made this film.\n\n\u201cI think the way that Oliver told the story and him himself being a person of colour ... we are forced into an understanding and for instance like my father there\u2019s a lot of things that I didn\u2019t understand about him and now ... after going through the process, I have started to learn more about him and the way that he operates,\u201d Brummer told Reuters.", "description": "South African director Oliver Hermanus hopes his new film about young soldiers during apartheid will help open up a conversation about what he calls \"toxic masculinity\" and LGBT rights.", "authors": ["Sarah Mills", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426934976&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851A3-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
