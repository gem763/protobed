Jane Fonda is the climate icon we need.\n\nIn her long career, Jane Fonda has repeatedly used her platform to advocate for important causes, which is one of the many reasons I\u2019m personally obsessed with her. From protesting the Vietnam War to being inspired by Greta Thunberg, Fonda is no stranger to a protest. This isn\u2019t even the first time she\u2019s been arrested, she was taken into custody on drug suspicions (they were actually vitamins) back in 1970, which she believes was President Nixon\u2019s attempt to \u201cruin [her] respectability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Come on, you know, you\u2019re taking our future away from us. We need \u2014 we need you to support us.\u2019 And so grandmas unite,\u201d Jane Fonda said. \u201cI want to stand with them and raise up\u2026 their message. This is \u2014 this is serious\u2026 This is a crisis unlike anything that has ever faced humankind.\u201d\n\nAlthough Fonda has been passionate about the planet for a long time, she was quick to thank Greta Thunberg for inspiring her to take a more active approach to the issue.\n\n\u201cRegister and vote, and vote for the climate. Vote for a Green New Deal. Up and down the ticket, not just president, but all the way down to your local officials,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then march. Demonstrate. Make a scene. Put your body on the line.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her weekly #FireDrillFriday protests, Jane has also started a web series that will feature climate experts every Thursday to keep the issue of the climate crisis relevant and spread more information.", "description": "Hollywood actress and activist Jane Fonda has been arrested in Washington, D.C for her participation in a climate change protest.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173985465-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
