Potential candidates include at least two conservative foreign policy commentators who appear on Fox News, where Bolton\u2019s fierce attacks on Democrats endeared him to Trump nearly two years ago.\n\nThe appeal didn\u2019t last, however, as Bolton\u2019s opposition to elements of Trump\u2019s approach on North Korea, Iran and Afghanistan, among other issues, put him at odds with his boss and other advisers. Trump also largely blamed his third national security adviser for overselling the strength of Venezuela\u2019s political opposition earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cI asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\u201d\n\nThe chaos and infighting that swirls around Trump\u2019s White House was on immediate display, as Bolton disputed the president\u2019s account of his departure.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, I resigned, having offered to do so last night,\u201d Bolton said in a text to The Washington Post. \u201cI will have my say in due course. But I have given you the facts on the resignation. My sole concern is US national security.\u201d\n\nBolton also responded to Trump on Twitter. \u201cI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow,\u2019 \u201d he wrote.\n\nBolton\u2019s chief nemesis within the administration, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, told reporters that \u201cthe president\u2019s entitled to the staff that he wants at any moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe should have people that he trusts and values,\u201d said Pompeo, who readily acknowledged disagreements with Bolton.\n\n\u201cThere were definitely places where Ambassador Bolton and I had differing views about how to proceed,\u201d Pompeo said as he and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke to reporters about an unrelated terrorism issue.\n\nJust hours earlier, the White House had listed Bolton as being scheduled to appear alongside Pompeo and Mnuchin at the same session. Despite months of rumors about Bolton\u2019s imminent ouster, the timing Tuesday appeared to take several senior White House officials and others by surprise.\n\n1 of 32 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Departures that made headlines during Trump\u2019s administration View Photos Thirty-two notable officials, from John Bolton to Sally Yates, have quit or been fired.

Other potential candidates include Douglas Macgregor, a retired Army officer whose conservative commentary has praised Trump\u2019s approach on Iran, and Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany, current and former officials and outside Trump advisers said.\n\nMacgregor met recently with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to discuss the potential of an administration job, two people familiar with the meeting said.\n\nBolton and Trump had been at odds on issues of both substance and style.\n\nBolton did not like Trump\u2019s repeated meetings with Kim Jong Un, administration officials said, and he had argued against directly meeting with Iranian officials. He also did not like the president\u2019s repeated insistence that Russia rejoin the Group of Seven nations.\n\nTrump regularly mocked Bolton as a warmonger, sometimes ticking off the names of countries and joking that Bolton would want to invade them, current and former senior administration officials said.\n\nThe mustachioed conservative, a fixture in Republican administrations and hawkish foreign policy circles for decades, was an odd fit from the start.\n\nWidely read and witty, Bolton was also known as a bureaucratic knife-fighter and a difficult colleague. He had ruffled feathers in previous administrations and on Capitol Hill. He could not win Senate confirmation as United Nations ambassador in 2005, leading President George W. Bush to install him there in a temporary capacity.\n\nAlthough he frequently said he had checked his own views at the West Wing door when he went to work for Trump, Bolton\u2019s distrust of diplomatic engagement with North Korea and Iran never abated. He also had more recently been seen as an obstacle in Trump\u2019s effort to broker an end to the Afghanistan war.\n\n\u201cThere is no one issue here,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t align on many issues.\u201d\n\nSenate Republicans were caught off guard \u2014 the Armed Services Committee chairman, James M. Inhofe (Okla.), said he found out because a staffer heard the news on the radio \u2014 and several expressed concerns about losing the hawkish adviser from the president\u2019s national security team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed. I don\u2019t know whether he was fired, or whether he resigned. I know what the president said, I know what he said,\u201d Inhofe said. \u201cNonetheless, he\u2019s one of my closest friends. He\u2019s one of the most knowledgeable that I know and I\u2019m disappointed that association has been dissolved.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a close Trump ally, said Trump deserved a national security adviser \u201che has confidence in.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me the relationship had soured and I hope he\u2019ll pick a national security adviser that he has confidence in,\u201d Graham said. \u201cBut I appreciate John Bolton. I think he sees the world for the dangerous place it is.\u201d\n\nBolton, who took the job in April 2018, was Trump\u2019s third permanent national security adviser. His deputy, Charlie Kupperman, will continue in an acting capacity.\n\n[Collapse of Afghanistan peace talks spotlights internal Trump administration divisions]\n\nBolton brought in many friends and former colleagues to the National Security Council, which while in keeping with past practice at the White House was also viewed by some Trump aides as excessive. Bolton\u2019s large entourage seemed to have deeper loyalty to Bolton than to Trump, one former senior administration official said.\n\nBolton acted like \u201ca big shot\u201d and Trump \u201cgot sick of it,\u201d said that former official, who like others interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.\n\nBolton recently said he did not want to appear on television to defend some of the administration\u2019s positions, particularly on Afghanistan and Russia, according to administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\n\u201cI think fundamentally President Trump and Bolton have different worldviews,\u201d said Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nWhile Bolton tweeted that he \u201coffered to resign\u201d on Monday evening, the actual time of his offer was Monday afternoon, in a meeting in the Oval Office with the president before Trump flew to North Carolina for a political rally, according to two people familiar with the discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations.\n\nBolton then mulled his resignation into Monday evening and gave a short letter to NSC staff on Tuesday, these people said.\n\nA former senior official said Mulvaney, Pompeo and Pence all concluded that Bolton had leaked internal deliberations surrounding a planned meeting at Camp David last weekend in which Trump would have met with Taliban representatives as a step to ending the 18-year war in Afghanistan. Trump canceled the secret meeting via Twitter on Saturday evening.\n\nTrump was infuriated at the idea that Bolton was trying to make himself look good, the official said.\n\nBolton has insisted to colleagues and confidants that he had done no such thing. Bolton\u2019s allies viewed this charge as a way to \u201cknife John on the way out,\u201d one person close to him said, and called it \u201cflatly untrue.\u201d\n\nBolton had argued against the U.S.-Taliban negotiations for months, saying that the Taliban could not be trusted and that Trump could achieve his chief aim in Afghanistan \u2014 the withdrawal of U.S. troops \u2014 without any agreement with the militants.\n\nDemocrats seized on the latest turnover in the administration.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action by the president is just the latest example of his government-by-chaos approach and his rudderless national security policy,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \u201cWhen Ambassador Bolton\u2019s extreme views aren\u2019t enough for you, the United States is headed for even more chaotic times.\u201d\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, lamented that \u201cwe\u2019re now headed for our fourth national security adviser in less than three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis revolving door of American leadership is devastating to our nation\u2019s security as our allies now turn to more stable nations \u2014 like China and Russia \u2014 as our foreign policy infrastructure falls apart,\u201d he said.\n\nBolton was preceded by Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.\n\nFlynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, resigned in February 2017 over revelations about his questionable contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States and his misleading statements about the matter to senior Trump administration officials. He is awaiting sentencing later this year after pleading guilty to lying to the FBI.\n\nMcMaster, an Army lieutenant general at the time of his hiring by Trump, was forced out in March 2018 after enduring the ire of conservatives for months and disagreeing with Trump on some key foreign policy strategies.\n\nJosh Dawsey, Mike DeBonis, Karen DeYoung, John Hudson, Colby Itkowitz, Seung Min Kim, Toluse Olorunnipa and Philip Rucker contributed to this report.", "description": "Bolton, who was Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, took issue with the president\u2019s assertion that he was fired, saying that he had offered his resignation.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_cQsW9XZpl_UrvVMgW9Qew9cyOQ=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YCP4SNWT4UI6TFQQ7NLMKURODQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
