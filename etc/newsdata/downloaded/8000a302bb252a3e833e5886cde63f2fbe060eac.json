Trump questioned if the process unfairly favored Amazon, long seen as the front-runner.\n\nExperts say it's unprecedented: A challenge from Amazon's cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), involving allegations that the president improperly intervened in the contract process would be unprecedented. Some of the top federal contracting experts in the country told The Hill they can't think of any similar case in recent history.\n\n\"We've had other contracts that have had major issues which were fought out in the public but none of which I'm aware where the president is alleged to have somehow tried to influence the procurement process,\" Dave Drabkin, a former top procurement executive at the General Services Administration, told The Hill.\n\nSteven Kelman, former head of the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Federal Procurement and current professor of public management at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, called the president's involvement in a specific contract \"extremely unusual, close to unheard of.\"\n\n\"It's against the norms and expectations of a system,\" Kelman said.\n\nTrump's involvement: Over the summer, Trump publicly questioned whether the JEDI contract was written with Amazon in mind, touting the argument that had been circulated for months by Amazon's cloud-computing rival Oracle and a procession of Republican lawmakers.\n\nDuring a news conference, Trump said, \"I'm getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. They're saying it wasn't competitively bid.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Donald (Don) John TrumpTrump Jr. sending copies of 'Triggered' book to Romney, top Democrats Transgender cyclist responds to Trump Jr. criticizing her women's world championship win Trump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House MORE, has publicly referred to the JEDI contract as the \"corrupt #BezosBailout,\" claiming it was written to bolster profits for the Amazon chief. The president's public remarks about JEDI, paired with his open antagonism toward Bezos, has raised serious questions over whether Trump weighed in on Microsoft's behalf in order to burn Amazon.\n\n\"The President's public comments about the JEDI contract have been well outside the norm,\" Rep.

Now, it is pinning the attack directly to the NSO Group.\n\nIn court filings with U.S. District Court in San Francisco, WhatsApp is alleging that the NSO Group sent malware to more than 1,000 of its users. That \"spyware\" allegedly allowed the NSO Group's clients to surveil users' messages.\n\nFacebook is claiming that the NSO used its software to access messages sent on WhatsApp as well as other messaging platforms including Apple's iMessage.\n\nRead more on the allegations here.\n\nBLUE DOGS PUSH FOR ELECTION SECURITY: Leaders of the Blue Dog Coalition on Tuesday urged House and Senate leaders to provide states with election security funds as part of the ongoing appropriations process.\n\nThe Coalition, which consists of 26 moderate Democrats, wrote a letter to the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees asking for their support in including $600 million to be given to states in order to bolster election security as part of the ongoing appropriations process.\n\n\"In light of the proven threat posed by Russia--and possibly other foreign powers--to our democratic process, we believe the final bill should provide $600 million or as close to it as possible,\" the leaders of the Coalition wrote.\n\nThey also asked that when the House and Senate meet to negotiate their bills that language requiring the funds to go towards improving the cybersecurity of elections also be added, such as providing cybersecurity training for election officials and moving towards voter-verified paper ballots.\n\nThe letter was signed by Reps.
