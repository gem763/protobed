Or do we help it more by keeping the small anchor we have in order maybe to exert pressure in other areas?\"\n\nGermany, Britain, France, China, Russia and the European Union have been trying to keep the 2015 deal with Iran alive since President Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out of it last year.\n\nThe deal offers Iran sanctions relief for limiting its nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that, so far, Tehran is sticking to the agreement.\n\nBut the US argues that the deal just puts off when Iran might be able to build a nuclear bomb. Speaking after Merkel, Pence pushed for Europeans to end their involvement in the nuclear deal, calling Iran \"the leading state sponsor of terrorism in the world.\"\n\n\"The time has come for our European partners to stop undermining US sanctions against this murderous revolutionary regime,\" Pence said. \"The time has come for our European partners to stand with us and with the Iranian people, our allies and friends in the region. The time has come for our European partners to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\"\n\nMerkel's speech was warmly received, while Pence's was met with polite applause.\n\n\"This was a big and say-it-as-it-is Merkel speech,\" Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations think tank, wrote on Twitter. \"Minutes of applause and standing ovations for a powerful commitment to picking up the pieces of a shattered (world) order and working on a European and (international) order that creates win-win situations.\"\n\nFormer US Vice President Joe Biden, who was in office when the Iran nuclear deal was negotiated, went out of his way to thank Merkel and defended the Iran deal as a \"significant agreement.\"\n\nBiden told the group that many Americans did not agree with the Trump administration's \"America first\" approach.\n\n\"You heard a lot today about leadership but in my experience, leadership only exists if somebody and others are with you,\" he said after Pence's address. \"Leadership in the absence of people who are with you is not leadership.\"\n\nIn her speech, Merkel also questioned whether it was a good idea for the US to withdraw troops quickly from Syria \"or is that not also strengthening the possibilities for Iran and Russia to exert influence there?\"\n\nTurning to nuclear disarmament, Merkel said the recent US announcement that it was pulling out of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty was \"inevitable\" because of Russian violations.\n\nMoscow followed suit by also withdrawing from the treaty, strongly denying any breaches. The US administration was also worried that the pact was an obstacle to efforts to counter intermediate-range missiles deployed by China, which is not covered by the treaty.\n\nMerkel noted the treaty was conceived \"essentially for Europe,\" where such missiles were stationed during the Cold War. She said \"the answer cannot lie in blind rearmament.\"\n\n\"Disarmament is something that concerns us all, and we would of course be glad if such negotiations were conducted not just between the United States ... and Russia, but also with China,\" she said.\n\nMerkel also defended Germany's progress in fulfilling NATO guidelines for countries to move toward spending 2% of their gross domestic product on defence by 2024, which has been criticized as too slow. And overall, she rejected the idea of a go-it-alone foreign policy.\n\nShe said it's better to \"put yourself in the other's shoes ... and see whether we can get win-win solutions together.\"\n\nPence stuck to the US line that the 2 percent NATO guideline is a strict commitment rather than a target, saying while more alliance members have met the criteria, \"the truth is, many of our NATO allies still need to do more.\"\n\nHe also reiterated American opposition to the joint German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Washington fears will make Europe overly reliant on Russian gas.\n\n\"The United States commends all our European partners who've taken a strong stand against Nord Stream 2,\" he said. \"And we commend others to do that same.\"\n\nHe added: \"We cannot ensure the defence of the West if our allies grow dependent on the East.\"\n\nMerkel defended the pipeline under the Baltic Sea, dismissing the American concerns as unfounded and assuring Ukraine that it won't get cut off from Russian fuel.\n\nSpeaking as Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko looked on, she told him his country would continue to be a transit country for Russian gas even after the pipeline is complete.\n\nMerkel noted that Europe also has enough terminals to receive more liquefied gas from the US, among other options.\n\n\"There's nothing that speaks against getting gas from the United States, but to exclude Russia is the wrong strategic signal,\" she said.\n\n\n\n", "description": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel has robustly defended European powers' decision to stand by the Iran nuclear deal but US Vice President Mike Pence promptly accused Europe of once again undermining the United States", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7993/88c8934f34be4fefb655a9979be744e5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-17"}
