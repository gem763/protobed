Strong winds and rain from Typhoon Lingling caused power outages in some 17,000 homes on the southern resort island of Jeju and in southern mainland regions, South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety said.\n\nThe typhoon was 114 miles southwest of the southern mainland city of Gunsan on Saturday morning, moving north at 28 miles power hour with winds of up to 87 miles per hour, the Korea Meteorological Association said.\n\nIt is expected to affect a broader part of the country as it passes off South Korea's west coast later on Saturday before making landfall in North Korea in the evening.\n\nFishing boats are anchored in port as Typhoon Lingling approaches to Korean peninsular on Jeju Island, South Korea, Friday, Sept. 6, 2019. Byun Ji-chul / AP\n\nThe storm toppled trees and street lamps and damaged traffic signs in Jeju overnight, caused airports to cancel 89 flights and forced 38 people to evacuate from their flooded homes in a city near Seoul. There were no immediate reports of injuries.\n\nNational parks were closed as were southern ports on the mainland and major cross-sea bridges. South Korea's weather agency has warned of flooding, landslides and structure damaged caused by strong rain and winds expected nationwide until early Sunday.\n\nNorth Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said leader Kim Jong Un \"urgently convened\" an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss disaster prevention efforts and scolded government officials who he described as \"helpless against the typhoon, unaware of its seriousness and seized with easygoing sentiment.\"\n\nKim called for his military to drive national efforts to minimize damage from the typhoon, which he said would be an \"enormous struggle\" that would require the entire country to step up, KCNA said.", "description": "It is expected to affect a broader part of the country as it passes off South Korea's west coast before making landfall in North Korea in the evening", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/07/5adb12ac-9f0b-431d-93a7-5c6a72e7bda6/thumbnail/1200x630/e8a021277978e1a520f790f0d9dcdb12/ap-19249358126973.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
