Johnson said it didn\u2019t \u201cline up with\u201d the city\u2019s core values, or his own, either.\n\n\u201cWith some of our communities under seige, it just doesn\u2019t line up with our city\u2019s core values, along with my personal values,\u201d Johnson said. At a news conference on Saturday, Johnson added, \u201cwe need immigrant communities to trust our police department.\u201d \u201cWe do not need them to fear us then to flee us,\u201d he said. \u201cOftentimes they won\u2019t report crimes, because they fear they may be revictimized. So, I think just personally for me, I just have to take that into account\u2026 and represent the way I think I should.\u201d\n\nProtests were organized prior to Trump\u2019s arrival on Monday.\n\nSeveral groups were also planning to meet near Trump Tower, including the Lincoln United Methodist Church and the Right to Family Campaign, who jointly hosted a candlelight vigil near the downtown hotel on Sunday evening. In preparation for these events, the Chicago Police Department says it placed safety barriers along the Chicago River as part of a wide-ranging \u201crolling security plan.\u201d Various security and safety measures were implemented by the department, and residents were told to expect significant traffic impacts, rolling street closures, and the potential for large crowd gatherings throughout the president\u2019s visit.\n\nImagine that. The top cop in America\u2019s third-largest city was unwilling to extend the basic courtesy of attending a speech delivered by the president. It sounds as though he is more concerned about the feelings of illegal immigrants than American citizens and Chicagoans. To be honest, that\u2019s common in the Age of Trump. The upper management of police departments in lots of large cities, including my own, often defy federal law in order to make a political statement against President Trump. Many cities place a priority on being sanctuary cities and calling for ICE to stay away.\n\nMaybe Superintendent Johnson just doesn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d President Trump. Chicago is a largely Democrat city. Perhaps Johnson is simply putting politics above all else. Chicago has a lot of problems, especially its murder rate, though, so I would think was a good opportunity to have a chat with the president and present some concerns. Johnson\u2019s ego may have been hurt when President Trump said Chicago is a poster city for violence. The truth hurts.\n\nThe Chicago-Sun Times editorial board published a screed heavy on sarcasm and light on common sense. The piece conflates illegal immigration with legal immigration among other standard criticisms of the Trump administration. We get it. The brutally honest Orange Man is bad. How dare he says what most Americans are thinking about Chicago.\n\nTrump is at war with everything that\u2019s best about our city and country \u2014 values like honesty, integrity, decency, compassion and a fair shake\n\nJohnson is vocal in his opinion that Trump is racist. The man he accuses of casting \u201cracial insults and hatred\u201d from the Oval Office is the same man that signed into law major criminal justice reform legislation which many in his city will benefit from but never mind those pesky facts.\n\n\u201cAs police officers, our job is to be the voice for the voiceless and ambassadors to the communities that we serve,\u201d Johnson said in response to the vote. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the oval office or Chicago is held hostage because of our views on new Americans.\u201d\n\nChicago Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham said the superintendent\u2019s decision to boycott the speech prompted a vote of \u201cno confidence\u201d from FOP union members.\n\n\u201cHe is the president of the United States. And, the reality of this is there are plenty of times I\u2019ve sat listening to speeches that I didn\u2019t care for, and I certainly didn\u2019t walk out on them,\u201d he said. Graham noted that the city of Chicago has \u201cderived a great deal of support\u201d from the president, particularly with ATF agents and federal prosecutors that \u201cprosecute our gun laws because our local prosecutor hasn\u2019t done the job.\u201d \u201cAnd, it\u2019s driven down the crime. Last month we took a thousand guns off the street. Last month alone,\u201d said Graham.\n\nLast week, an editorial in the Chicago Tribune called for an internal investigation into an incident involving Johnson.\n\nNot long after midnight last Thursday, officers responding to a 911 call found Johnson asleep behind the wheel of his parked car at a Bridgeport intersection. A department spokesman said that officers \u201cdid not observe any signs of impairment\u201d and let him drive himself to his nearby home. On Thursday evening, Johnson explained that he had felt exhausted during the day and, as he was driving, felt he was about to pass out from high blood pressure, for which he had stopped taking medication. So he pulled over and dozed off. On Friday, though, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Johnson told her he had \u201ca couple of drinks with dinner\u201d before getting behind the wheel. But because the officers didn\u2019t administer a field sobriety test, as would be expected in such a case, it\u2019s not clear whether he was impaired. The mayor shrugged off his decision to imbibe before driving, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s a grown man.\u201d\n\nThe Tribune points out that Johnson referred the matter to the bureau of internal affairs but that\u2019s not good enough. The Chicago Police Department doesn\u2019t have a good track record on policing its own. You would think, given the recent headlines like this, that Johnson would be looking to keep a lower profile, not to heap more public scrutiny upon himself.\n\nI\u2019ll end with this \u2013 President Trump also did some fundraising while he was in the Windy City. A fundraiser was hosted by Todd Ricketts, Chicago Cubs co-owner and RNC Finance chairman. With a fundraiser and a speech on Trump\u2019s schedule in Chicago, it seems like a missed opportunity for city leaders to come together and ask for their own meeting with Trump. There is a strong possibility Trump would relish a chance to be seen as a problem-solver and reaching out to those who politically oppose him would be good for both sides. The Rev. Michael L. Pfleger, a pastor at St. Sabina Church and far-left social justice warrior (and friend of Obama\u2019s pal Rev. Wright) wrote to Trump recently, he claims, to come and meet with city leaders.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump has continually tweeted and spoken in sound bites about Chicago,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cSince he is coming, take time to listen and learn, to see how he can help. If he is only coming to pick up money, he should stay home.\u201d\n\nThe losers in all of this?
