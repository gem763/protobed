I think she handled it in a classy way,\" Lelling said. \"And so, at the end of the day, we thought the one-month was proportional.\"\n\nLelling told WCVB that the larger amount of money Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying could work against them. Cooperating, he said, would help.\n\n\"The longer a case goes \u2014 let's say if she goes through to trial \u2014 if it's after trial, I think certainly we'd be asking for something substantially higher,\" the prosecutor said. \"If she resolved her case short of trial, something a little lower than that.\"\n\nNOW WATCH: 30 years after 'When Harry Met Sally,' Katz's is still the most legendary deli in NYC", "description": "Andrew Lelling, the US attorney for the District of Massachusetts said Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, should plead guilty.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XFOalTaIyWMyPJL9Jmp2Cw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/447c97cc34b0053984553c9d89a867c4", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
