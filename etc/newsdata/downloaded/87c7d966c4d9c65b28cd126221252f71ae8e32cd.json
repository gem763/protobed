In other words, no detail is too small for him to control.\n\nNeedless to say, this micromanaging boss will not delegate any decision making to anyone who works under him. Every morning, for example, he or she, the micromanaging boss will tell their charge what their jobs are and everything has to be done their way, exactly their way.\n\nOnly in this way will the micromanaging boss be satisfied. Only then will they feel that they\u2019re in complete control. Otherwise they\u2019ll get terribly uneasy and probably go mad.\n\nBeing a freak, you see, means that they\u2019re not normal but are excessively obsessed with something. A fitness freak, for example, is someone who is always in the gym trying to get more muscular. A diet freak, for another example, is someone who may insist on eating only vegetables. Or they may eat chicken breast but not red meat, like, at all.\n\nA control freak, on the other hand, is someone who takes controlling others or controlling situations to the extreme. They get out of control themselves if people don\u2019t carry out their orders to a T.\n\nActually, a control freak may just be an insecure person who needs others to obey their orders to feel confident.\n\nAt any rate, there\u2019s something abnormal about a control freak or any other freak, for that matter. There\u2019s something wrong.\n\nAnd here are examples of real people who are described as a control freak:\n\n\n\n1. Doris Day, who died this month at 97, was the queen of wholesome, romantic comedies \u2014 America\u2019s sweetheart of the Eisenhower age. But one of her more memorable roles was anything but sweet or lovely.\n\nIn the 1955 biopic \u201cLove Me or Leave Me,\u201d Day played a singer for whom romance was a tragedy, complete with a jealous husband, a murder attempt, and death.\n\nThe movie was based on the life of Ruth Etting, America\u2019s sweetheart of song in the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression.\n\nLike Day, the blond, blue-eyed \u201cQueen of the Torchers\u201d gave voice to her era, with such hits as \u201cTen Cents a Dance,\u201d \u201cShine On Harvest Moon,\u201d and \u201cShakin\u2019 the Blues Away.\u201d Her rise was meteoric, bringing her center stage of the Ziegfeld Follies and, through radio, recordings, and movies, into the homes and hearts of millions of Americans.\n\nNo less an authority than Mae West admired her allure. \u201cShe had a sex quality that seemed to mesmerize the audience,\u201d West said, \u201cWhen she finished singing, they just kind of went crazy.\u201d\n\nUnlike Day, Etting is almost forgotten now, even though we still sing songs she made popular. The scandal surrounding her troubled marriage killed her career, wrote Kenneth Irwin and Charles O. Lloyd in \u201cRuth Etting: America\u2019s Forgotten Sweetheart.\u201d\n\nEtting was born in Nebraska in 1896. At 19, she moved to Chicago to study art and found work making theatrical costumes. Within a year, she had become a chorus girl, sewing by day and singing by night.\n\nIn 1920, Ruth met Martin Snyder, 26, who grew up in one of the Chicago\u2019s toughest neighborhoods. He was known as \u201cMoe the Gimp.\u201d No one knows exactly how he hurt his left leg \u2014 stories included a scuffle with the KKK, a gunshot wound, or a childhood injury.\n\nSnyder used his influence with Chicago\u2019s underworld big shots to open some doors for his \u201clittle lady.\u201d They married in 1922.\n\nThe bride had misgivings from the start. Etting said she married him because she was afraid to say no.\n\nFriends asked why she stayed. \u201cIf I leave him, he\u2019ll kill me,\u201d she told them.\n\nHe managed her career, but there was no denying that her talent was driving her success. Some of the biggest names in entertainment \u2014 King of Jazz Paul Whiteman, songwriter Irving Berlin, and Flo Ziegfeld \u2014 were impressed with her voice. She sang her most famous torch song, \u201cLove Me or Leave Me,\u201d for Ziegfeld\u2019s production of \u201cWhoopee!\u201d in 1928.\n\nAlong with glowing reviews, newspapers started to carry stories about her husband.\n\nIt was an ugly picture of a control freak who managed every aspect of her life, where she went, who she talked to, even how she wore her hair.\n\nHe harassed, threatened, and beat up friends and colleagues, often while carrying a knife or gun. He also slapped her around.\n\n- Justice Story: The sour tale of one of America\u2019s Sweethearts, NYDailyNews.com, May 26, 2019.\n\n\n\n2. Her voice is hoarse from talking, her authority waning, and her overriding political goal \u2014 taking Britain out of the European Union with a negotiated deal \u2014 seems like a mirage.\n\nYet British Prime Minister Theresa May keeps going, declining to resign despite two successive parliamentary defeats of historic proportion. She is still pushing her agreement, ignoring ample evidence that Parliament won\u2019t buy it and the Europeans won\u2019t sweeten it.\n\nBritons seem divided between expressing admiration for her fortitude and wondering how badly her head must hurt from continually banging it against the wall.\n\nHer position is weak: May leads a minority government that depends on a small Northern Ireland party to keep her in power, and that party \u2014 and many of her own Conservatives \u2014 have twice voted against her withdrawal plan.\n\n\u201cI think it is time to realize that if two votes have gone unsuccessful then she really needs to consider things,\u201d said artist Louise Webb in the port city of Dover, suggesting it may be time for May to step down.\n\n...\n\nFellow Conservative Party lawmaker Nick Boles says May is \u201ca control freak\u201d who has greatly restricted Parliament\u2019s ability to consider other possible paths to Brexit that might actually get approved.\n\n\u201cShe hasn\u2019t allowed Parliament to explore what alternative compromises we might support,\u201d he told BBC radio. \u201cPeople keep saying there is no majority for any compromise. We don\u2019t know that. We\u2019ve never been allowed to debate and vote on anything other than her deal.\u201d\n\n- UK PM Theresa May: Hoarse, Beaten Down but Won\u2019t Give up on Brexit, MoneyAndMarkets.com, March 13, 2019.\n\n\n\n3. On a sweltering August morning early in training camp, Miami Dolphins first-year coach Brian Flores made a mistake.\n\nIt was a mental lapse involving the defense, the sort of thing he rails against every day. And so Flores did what his players do as punishment in such situations, sprinting across the field into the corner, slapping a wall designated for the acknowledgement of mistakes in practice and then hustling back to rejoin his team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lead by example,\u201d Flores said.\n\nOK, so maybe he\u2019s not a Bill Belichick clone.\n\nBut how far does Flores fall from the Belichick coaching tree? The answer could determine whether the Dolphins win with their new coach, a longtime New England Patriots assistant.\n\nThe Dolphins hired Flores even though the Patriots' Way tends to be a dead end for other teams. While the Pats are six-time Super Bowl champions under Belichick, his former New England assistants have combined for one playoff victory as NFL head coaches.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t replicate what they have up there, right?\u201d former Patriots tight end Dwayne Allen said. \u201cA lot of people have tried and failed.\u201d\n\nThat group includes former head coaches Romeo Crennel, Eric Mangini and Josh McDaniels in the NFL, and Charlie Weis at Notre Dame and Kansas. The jury is still out on two second-year head coaches with New England backgrounds: former Belichick assistant Matt Patricia (6-10 with the Lions last year) and ex-Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel (9-7 with the Titans).\n\nAdd to that sextet the somewhat successful Bill O'Brien (43-41 entering his sixth season with the Texans, but only 1-3 in the playoffs), and their combined winning percentage is .430, compared with Belichick\u2019s .741 in New England.\n\nSome suspect Belichick\u2019s proteges have tried too hard to Be Like Bill.\n\n\u201cThere have been mistakes,\u201d said former Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi, who spent nine seasons playing for Belichick and is now an ESPN analyst. \u201cWhen you try to clone Bill Belichick\u2019s style and it\u2019s not who you are, it\u2019s going to come off as disingenuous. You\u2019re not going to feel real to players, and players can feel that. That mistake has been done in the past by his coaching tree.\u201d\n\nPatricia had a rocky first season in part because he sounded a little like Belichick during news conferences, snapping at questions and providing short answers that made him a punchline with pundits.\n\n\n\nMangini was a control freak who was hard on his players with the Jets and Browns, and he got off to a bad start in Cleveland when he made rookies take a 10-hour bus trip to attend his youth camp. McDaniels wore a hoodie every day in Denver and yelled at his assistants.\n\nIn sum, Belichick\u2019s proteges tend to mimic his unrelenting approach. And they tend to struggle.\n\n\u201cThey try to push it hard, and it's hard for certain players to grasp,\u201d Bruschi said. \u201cSay you\u2019ve been coddled. It can be a shock to the system when you\u2019re told to be somewhere at a certain time, stay until a certain time, work hard every second you\u2019re there and do things a certain way, which is a night-and-day difference from the previous head coach. Some of these coaches experience resistance, and it's hard to break that. You're reprogramming players on what winning football is.\u201d\n\n- Patriots\u2019 Way has often been a bust elsewhere, AP, Aug. 31, 2019.\n\n\u672c\u6587\u4ec5\u4ee3\u8868\u4f5c\u8005\u672c\u4eba\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4e0e\u672c\u7f51\u7acb\u573a\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6b22\u8fce\u5927\u5bb6\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b66\u672f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c0a\u91cd\u4ed6\u4eba\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u4eba\u8eab\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u4e00\u5207\u8fdd\u53cd\u56fd\u5bb6\u73b0\u884c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6cd5\u89c4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n\nAbout the author:\n\nZhang Xin is Trainer at chinadaily.com.cn.
