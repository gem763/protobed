Trump's comments after the close on Wall Street, calling negotiations \"very, very good,\" sent S&P 500 futures higher.\n\nThe euro hit its highest since Sept. 20 versus the dollar as the greenback turned weaker across the board <.DXY>, partly due to a Bloomberg report about a U.S.-China currency pact to stop the yuan's devaluation. China's offshore yuan hit its strongest levels in more than two weeks.\n\nSterling jumped just shy of 2%, on track for its largest gain against the dollar in seven months, after Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\nThe risk-on environment weighed on the greenback, and even harder on Japan's yen.\n\n\"With a Brexit deal looking more likely and U.S.-China talks showing more progress, it's just clear that the dollar is losing some safe-haven demand,\" said Juan Perez, senior currency trader at Tempus Inc in Washington.\n\nThe dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.4%, with the euro <EUR=> unchanged at $1.1004.\n\nSterling <GBP=> settled at $1.2440, up 1.9% on the day. The safe-haven yen suffered through a risk-on session and dropped 0.46% to the greenback at 107.96 per dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRADE THE TWEETS\n\nTrump's tweet announcing his Friday meeting with Liu gave \"market participants a reason to believe that perhaps a trade deal or at least a partial trade deal might be announced as early as tomorrow,\" said Robert Pavlik chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.\n\nSeparately, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported Liu said Beijing was willing to reach an agreement with Washington to prevent any further escalation of the trade war.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 150.66 points, or 0.57%, to 26,496.67, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 18.73 points, or 0.64%, to 2,938.13 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 47.04 points, or 0.6%, to 7,950.78.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX600 index <.STOXX> rose 0.65% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.56%.\n\nEmerging market stocks rose 0.35%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> closed 0.17% higher, while Nikkei futures <NKc1> rose 0.74%.\n\nTreasury yields also rose on hopes of a trade resolution between the United States and China. However, some investors highlighted the difficulty of using the rapidly shifting headlines on trade to direct investment strategy.\n\n\"A choppy overnight session driven by conflicting signals regarding trade negotiations highlights the difficulty in chasing every 5 basis point move in yields, in that the proximate justification can unwind just as quickly,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nBenchmark 10-year notes <US10YT=RR> last fell 24/32 in price to yield 1.6698%, from 1.587% late on Wednesday.\n\nThe two-year note <US2YT=RR last fell 5/32 in price to yield 1.5464%, from 1.474% late on Wednesday.\n\nSafe-haven gold fell; spot gold <XAU> dropped 0.8% to $1,493.85 an ounce.\n\nCopper <CMCU3> posted its largest daily gain in a month, up 1.70% to $5,780.50 a tonne.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic: Global assets in 2019 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic: Emerging markets in 2019 - http://tmsnrt.rs/2ihRugV\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Jessica Resnick-Ault and Kate Duguid in New York and Jeff Mason in Washington; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Tom Brown)", "description": "", "authors": ["Rodrigo Campos"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/V.Hdgh.UevwVgoZfwoCyCw--~B/aD0yOTk7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/5dd194e8b35959fadeb1f8b83ca81537", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
