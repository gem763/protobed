Huffman, Loughlin and Loughlin\u2019s fashion-designer husband, the 55-year-old Mossimo Giannulli, were charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty in May for paying $15,000 to have her daughter\u2019s SAT scores fixed in 2017. Her actor husband, William H. Macy, who starred in the film \"Fargo\" and Showtime's hit \"Shameless,\" was not named in court papers.\n\nThirteen other parents have allegedly copped to their crimes.\n\nLoughlin and her husband were among 16 parents indicted in April on charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nThe couple are accused of paying William \u201cRick\u201d Singer \u2014 who, according to the Department of Justice, ran a \u201cfor-profit college counseling and preparation business\u201d \u2013 approximately $500,000 to create nonexistent positions for their daughters on the University of Southern California\u2019s crew team even though neither had ever taken part in the sport.\n\n\u201cRest assured, other than Ms. Huffman and her immediate family, Ms. Loughlin was likely the second most anxious person awaiting the judge\u2019s decision with bated breath,\u201d New York City-based defense attorney and former prosecutor Jeremy Saland said.\n\n\u201cBarring an Emmy-winning performance and acquittal at trial, the ugly reality is that Ms. Loughlin\u2019s next role will be an inmate in a federal penitentiary.\u201d\n\nSaland has previously prosecuted a professional test-taking ring involving more than 500 students who had recruited an imposter to take their GRE, GMAT and similar exams.\n\n\u201cNot only did [prosecutors] need to demonstrate that society\u2019s entitled upper crust should not get a mere walk because of their celebrity and the white-collar nature of their criminality,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut if successful in their bid to incarcerate Ms. Huffman for any duration, then those who are convicted of more egregious conduct involving greater dollars should have no misgivings.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Julie Rendelman, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor who is also based in New York, said people are quick to \u201cassume [Loughlin] committed this crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s exercising her right to hold their feet to the fire,\u201d Rendelman said, calling Loughlin \u201csomeone who is exercising her right to make the prosecutors prove their case.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line, Colorado-based defense lawyer Sharon Liko noted, is that unless Loughlin pleads guilty, she will go to trial like any person would.\n\n\u201cLori Loughlin has not plead guilty and Lori Loughlin is going to go to trial,\" Liko said, matter-of-factly. \"Who knows what that outcome is going to be. If she\u2019s found not guilty, that\u2019s the end of it. If she\u2019s found guilty she\u2019s going to be sentenced like everybody else.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Associated Press and FOX News's Andrew Fone contributed to the reporting for this story.", "description": "Attorneys located in New York, Washington D.C. and Chicago spoke to FOX Business following Friday\u2019s sentencing.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/felicity-huffman-getty-01.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
