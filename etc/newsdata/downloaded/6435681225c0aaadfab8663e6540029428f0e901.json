The bank offers about 21 interest-free months to customers in exchange for a small fee, whereas its competitors offer up to 15 months for no fee.\n\nPer the payments industry publication, The Nilson Report, Citi is considered the third largest U.S. card issuer. Also, of the overall revenues, card business makes up about one-third share.\n\nPer the article, this facility is considered to be risky by some analysts, especially in scenario when the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowdown. Also, customers using such features are deemed risky as they use such facilities to accumulate more debt.\n\nHowever, Citi\u2019s executives support their strategy and argue that they have tough underwriting standards in place to safeguard the bank in case of any major loss from adverse situations in the future.\n\nCiti continues to advertise interest free feature on popular personal finance websites and through mailers. All other peers have reduced marketing efforts on this scheme.\n\nNotably, Citi\u2019s card business has witnessed delinquency rates much lower than the industry\u2019s average, per federal data and filings. Also, according to a credit rating firm Experian, 83% of consumers in its U.S. credit card business, excluding its retail partnership cards, have good credit scores of 680.\n\nCitigroup continues to execute growth strategies, such as entering the booming digital consumer payments industry and expanding global market presence, thereby aiming to diversify revenue sources.\n\nYear to date, the stock has gained 26.7%, outperforming 11.6% growth recorded by the industry.\n\nCurrently, Citi carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
