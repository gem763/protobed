But for two pitchers generally generous with words and insight, neither man seemed to want to talk about that collision much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years,\u201d Verlander said, deftly sidestepping a reporter\u2019s request for funny anecdotes about Scherzer, his teammate with the Detroit Tigers from 2010 to 2014. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any off the top of my head.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked what he learned from Verlander, Scherzer also avoided specifics.\n\n\u201cIn Detroit, I learned so much from everybody, and especially from Ver, of just how to go about it, attack the lineup, how you take a ball every fifth day,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cJust all the little things that go into being a major league pitcher. He was at the forefront of that, and we all developed together, and it was a fun time.\u201d\n\nScherzer and Verlander will always be linked. Their legacies will almost certainly fall side-by-side in the record books, where they will be remembered as two of the most durable, most decorated and most powerful pitchers of their generation. Verlander signed the biggest extension for a starter in major league history, a five-year pact with the Tigers in 2013 that meant he would get $180 million over seven seasons, including after he was traded to the Astros in 2017. Scherzer signed a seven-year deal worth $210 million with the Nationals in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey are both right-handers whose early success depended on power fastballs. They have both learned to maneuver with more finesse. They have both proved more durable than most of their peers. And they share five seasons of history in Detroit, where they were part of one of the more vaunted (and, ultimately, most disappointing) rotations of the past decade \u2014 a group that lost to San Francisco in the 2012 World Series and never got back.\n\nSeasons such as those might as well be mini-lifetimes, and they can foster lifelong bonds, but Scherzer and Verlander haven\u2019t shared one. They are closer with many other former teammates than they are with each other. They don\u2019t talk much off the field \u2014 colleagues but not friends.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of similarities but a lot of differences as well,\u201d Verlander said. \u201cI think on the field, there\u2019s a lot of similarities. Then off the field, there\u2019s a lot of differences in how we go about things as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVerlander has always been more of a red-carpet, celebrity-type. He married model Kate Upton. He is vocal and opinionated on Twitter. He dresses sharply and has shot non-baseball magazine covers. He is a traditional star who embraces the spotlight.\n\nScherzer, meanwhile, once walked out of the clubhouse in cargo shorts, a T-shirt, flip-flops and a backward hat \u2014 with a Cy Young Award he had left in the clubhouse under his arm. He isn\u2019t much of a tweeter. He still talks trash on a group text with his old college buddies. And he never stops talking trash with his teammates \u2014 unless, of course, he\u2019s explaining the differences between American and European weather modeling, which he is happy to do as well.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re totally different,\u201d said Nationals right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, who was also part of that Tigers rotation. \u201cMax is more electric. Verlander is more calm. I\u2019m not going to say one is better to the other one, but you can see they\u2019re different on the mound in that way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVerlander and Scherzer are both dogged in their preparation, but they differ there, too. Verlander is known as one of baseball\u2019s most relentless creatures of habit, particularly on days he pitches \u2014 \u201call about business,\u201d said Brayan Pe\u00f1a, who caught both Scherzer and Verlander for a year in \u00adDetroit.\n\n\u201cScherzer was a little bit looser. He was kidding around. He was goofing around the clubhouse. But when it was time to get serious, he was 100 percent committed.\u201d\n\nScherzer is quirky. Verlander is polished. Scherzer grunts and punches his glove and foams at the mouth. Verlander is less demonstrative. Jim Leyland, their old Tigers manager, said he never paid much attention to what effect their differences had on their relationship. S\u00e1nchez and Pe\u00f1a said they pushed each other, but then again, everyone pushed \u00adeveryone else on that team.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they probably fed off each other a little bit,\u201d said Leyland, who did say his pitching coach, Jeff Jones, always felt a rivalry existed between them.\n\n\u201cAll of them are full of pride. There\u2019s no question,\u201d Leyland added. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can be that good unless you have it.\u201d\n\nNow, as they prepare to take their turns on the World Series stage, their parallel careers still diverge in one particularly relevant way: Both Scherzer and Verlander started games that the Tigers lost in their unsuccessful World Series appearance in 2012. At the time, on that team, both seemed destined to get at least another chance or two. Verlander did. He won his title with the Astros in 2017. Scherzer, who allowed three runs in 6\u2153 innings in a decisive Game 4, never got a second World Series chance. His comes Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the World Series:\n\nAD", "description": "The future Hall of Fame starters were in the same rotation for five seasons with the Tigers, but their relationship isn\u2019t much deeper than that.", "authors": ["Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8f1PtDJRD8ynxEeXhCc-ZnFjzro=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7Z6AEFHUKII6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
