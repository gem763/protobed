The creepy coincidences in Hollywood horrors", "language": "en", "text": "Moviegoers flock to see horror films in their droves, relishing the feeling of being terrified to their core by menacing forces and otherworldly spirits.\n\nBut when the horror of these scary movies spills off screen, the impact can be much more disturbing.\n\nEver since the horror genre took off in Hollywood five decades ago, there has been a slew of sinister events surrounding some of the most famous flicks, including Poltergeist, The Amityville Horror, The Conjuring, and Annabelle.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEver since horror movies began to take off in Hollywood, there have been sinister events surrounding some of the most famous flicks, such as The Exorcist (left) and Poltergeist (right)\n\nRumors of horror movies being cursed have been swirling around from as early as 1973 when The Exorcist first terrified and horrified moviegoers with its chilling story of demonic possession.\n\nSeveral sinister incidents on and off set led to speculation that dark forces were at work. Actress Linda Blair, who played the little girl possessed by the devil, fractured her lower back, the set caught fire for no apparent reason, an actor's child was involved in a terrible road accident, and another actor lost his life to influenza shortly after filming ended.\n\nMore recently, there were fears that Resident Evil: The Final Chapter was cursed after a stunt woman lost her arm and suffered horrific injuries from an accident while filming in South Africa in 2015.\n\nOlivia Jackson spent 17 days in an induced coma after a high speed motorcycle stunt went terribly wrong and her bike collided with a mechanical mobile film camera. She had half her face torn off, suffered a painfully twisted spine, and was forced to have her left arm amputated as a result of her injuries.\n\nLater that year, another crew member died on the same set after being crushed by a Hummer. South African Ricardo Cornelius was pinned to a wall by the US Army issue vehicle when it tipped over as it was being moved from a rotating platform.\n\nAs well as raising questions about safety on set, the incidents led to speculation that this was another horror movie that was 'cursed'.\n\nIn 2015 a stunt woman lost her arm and suffered horrific injuries in an accident while filming Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (pictured) in Johannesburg, South Africa\n\nActor Brandon Lee was shot dead in a freak accident during filming of horror movie The Crow\n\nIn this week's episode of True Hollywood Story, E! will look at some of the most disturbing occurrences both on and off sets of horror movies, asking the question of whether Hollywood is tempting fate by telling these terrifying stories.\n\nWhether you believe in the supernatural or not, the list of incidents is chilling.\n\nThese include claw marks appearing on objects, lightning strikes during premieres, a helicopter crash, and actor Brandon Lee being killed in a freak accident during filming of The Crow.\n\nIn 1993, Brandon - the son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee - was shot in the abdomen by a gun that was meant to be firing blanks while on set in North Carolina.\n\nSo it's not hard to see why the superstitious among us believe that on-screen terror is being reflected in real-life, with some going as far as to reference demonic forces and dark curses.\n\nE! True Hollywood Story will delve into these incidents and more when Horror Movies: Cursed or Coincidence? airs on October 27.", "description": "Ever since the horror genre began to take over Hollywood, there have been a slew of sinister events surrounding some of the most famous flicks, including The Exorcist and  Poltergeist.", "authors": ["Annabel Grossman For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/21/19758400-0-image-a-154_1571171262081.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
