Among those that did arrive was a flight from Sydney via Singapore. An Australian couple, weary after the 24-hour trip, said they had had to travel two days\u2019 earlier than planned because of the stoppage.\n\nThe only short-haul arrival will be a single service from Edinburgh.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A trickle of smartly dressed British Airways ground staff bought coffee, and looked around for passengers to help.\n\nThey were thin on the ground, because the vast majority of the almost 200,000 passengers booked on BA during the strike have been handed their money back, transferred to other flights on the airline or been rebooked on other carriers.\n\nInevitably, some travellers did not get the message. Teresa McKeon had arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3, by air, on the longest possible flight: the 17-hour nonstop Qantas flight from Perth in Western Australia. She had a \u201cconfirmed\u201d connection to Dublin on British Airways from Terminal 5.\n\nDuring her four-week stay in Australia Ms McKeon had not had word of the strike, nor of BA\u2019s blanket cancellations on Monday and Tuesday. No-one during her journey or on arrival alerted her to the fact that her best hope was a flight on Aer Lingus.\n\nThe Independent told her of the shutdown. At least there were multiple British Airways staff on hand to try to rebook her and direct her back to the central area at Heathrow.\n\nEarlier in the morning, one or two journalists showed up to discreetly survey the wide-open spaces of Terminal 5, before retreating back to the media\u2019s usual encampment beside the Three Magpies pub \u2013 overlooking the tunnel to the central area, the miniature Emirates Airbus A380 and the northern runway.\n\nSadly for the sake of their live appearances, departures were thin on the ground. With more than half of Heathrow\u2019s departures grounded, take-offs seemed reduced to every five or 10 minutes. For local residents, the frequency of air movements was back to the 1970s \u2013 which is where the dispute also seems to be be heading.\n\nAs the biggest strike in the history of British Airways grounds almost all the airline\u2019s flights, BA and the pilots\u2019 union look further apart than ever.", "description": "Not since the ash cloud in 2010, when an Icelandic volcano shut down UK aviation for nearly a week, has Heathrow Terminal 5 been so quiet.
