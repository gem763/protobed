Ruby was just born and Davina was idly scrolling through properties in Cornwall.\n\nThey ended up renting a tiny house in Perranporth, got the kids into school and bought a derelict old miners\u2019 cottage in Redruth.\n\nThey created Cligga Cliff Farm (Picture: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\nTodd worked on renovating the house while Davina, who had been a professional photographer in London, worked in Spar and the Cornish Pizza Co.\n\nShe said: \u2018We had all these bills and all this pressure.\n\n\u2018It was not my ambition from being a successful photographer in London to working in a supermarket.\n\n\u2018And we were beginning to get burnt out by the property thing. Todd and I were used to camping \u2013 we met working at festivals \u2013 so we rented out the house in Redruth and started to look for land.\u2019\n\nThe family raise cows, pigs, and chickens (Picture: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe dream bit of land finally came up in the form of a seven and three quarter acre plot right on the heritage coast path, by the cliffs.\n\nThe sale went through and the family started working the land right away, adopting four black pigs and some chickens. At this point they had no income and were struggling to afford rent on their house in Redruth.\n\nEventually they had no choice but to move out of their home and on to the land, with just a horsebox, a bell tent, and a shack Todd had built out of some pallets.\n\nBy the end of next summer they\u2019ll be entirely self-sufficient (Picture: Cornwall Live /SWNS.COM)\n\nThey started to offer camping in the spot, which allowed them to set up Cligga Cliff Farm, a fully-fledged farm that runs a monthly plastic-free market, selling free-range pork, eggs, and vegetables.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe family now have cows and are starting their own micro-dairy, and plan to rear turkeys in time for Christmas.\n\n\u2018By the end of next summer we\u2019ll be self-sufficient,\u2019 says Davina.\n\nMORE: Mum had no idea \u2018funny\u2019 tasting wine was first sign of heart attack\n\nMORE: A petty man built the thinnest house ever just to block his brother\u2019s view of the sea\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Davina Foster and her four children have moved to Cornwall to start their own farm in Perranporth.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89830672_1571140746.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
