TSN, -2.25% announced Thursday plans to prohibit use of ractopamine in the hogs it buys from farmers starting in February 2020, in an effort to boost exports to countries that prohibit the feed ingredient. Ractopamine, a feed ingredient that helps increase the amount of lean meat in hogs, is deemed safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but some countries, such as China, ban the import of pork from hogs fed with ractopamine. \"We believe the move to prohibit ractopamine use will allow Tyson Fresh Meats and the farmers who supply us to compete more effectively for export opportunities in even more countries,\" said Tyson Fresh Meats President Steve Stouffer. Tyson, which generates nearly $1 billion in pork export sales a year, said it notified farmers on Wednesday of the new requirement. Tyson's stock, which was still inactive in premarket trading, has rallied 53.3% year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.20% has climbed 19.3%.", "description": "Tyson Foods Inc. announced Thursday plans to prohibit use of ractopamine in the hogs it buys from farmers starting in February 2020, in an effort to boost...", "authors": ["Tomi Kilgore", "Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
