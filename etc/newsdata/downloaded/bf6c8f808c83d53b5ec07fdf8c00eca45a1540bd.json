REUTERS/Carlos Osorio\n\nThe Bloc, which fields candidates only in the French-speaking province, has surged during the six-week official campaign, partly thanks to Blanchet\u2019s convincing performance in the debates, where he promised to stick up for Quebec.\n\nThat has eaten into both Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s support in the province, which is a key battleground in a very tight race.\n\nIn a speech on Saturday in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, a town to the southeast of Montreal, Blanchet said the Bloc\u2019s position was that the Quebec nation \u201cwill have to once again consider giving itself all the attributes of sovereignty.\u201d\n\nThat was enough for both Trudeau and Scheer to respond that Blanchet would take the province once again down a path toward separation from the rest of Canada, a prospect most Quebecers have not embraced in recent years.\n\n\u201cCanadians need to come together and we got a very clear reminder of that last night in Quebec when the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois came out and said its number one priority is separation, dividing the country once again,\u201d Trudeau said at a bakery in the Vancouver suburb of Port Moody.\n\nScheer said the Bloc would seek another referendum over whether Quebec should proclaim sovereignty after the two previous ones failed. The last one, in 1995, ended with 50.6% saying \u201cno\u201d and 49.4% saying \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cA vote the bloc is a vote for the referendum,\u201d Scheer said in Vancouver.\n\nThe provincial party that triggered both referenda was the Parti Quebecois, which got hammered in last year\u2019s provincial election by the nationalist Coalition Avenir Quebec.\n\nBlanchet himself responded to Trudeau and Scheer on Sunday on Twitter, saying ambiguously: \u201cWe understand the limits of the mandate of Quebecers and we respect all of Quebec.\u201d", "description": "The two frontrunners in Canada's election campaign attacked the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, Yves-Francois Blanchet, on Sunday, the final day before the vote, for again raising the prospect of a sovereign Quebec.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1443092059&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0NB-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
