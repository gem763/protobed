The selloff trims the year-to-date net inflow to $3.7 billion.\n\nInvestors have been worried that earnings will slump as growth in gross domestic product slows to 5.05%, the weakest in two years. To make matters worse, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Jakarta last week as part of countrywide protests aimed at forcing the government to reconsider legislation rights that groups say will curtail civil liberties.\n\nThe trouble signals a tough path ahead for President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, before he starts his second term next month. He managed to lead with a wider margin during the re-election in April and is expected to name his new cabinet after the Oct. 20 inauguration.\n\n\u201cThe economic slowdown has been caused by a wait-and-see attitude among investors in the lead up to the cabinet formation,\u201d said Harry Su, head of equity capital markets at Samuel International. \u201cContinued demonstrations and skirmishes on the ground are adding to worries and contributed to the biggest net foreign outflow since June 2018.\u201d\n\nSu said he would advise clients to maintain their holdings of defensive stocks and wait for Widodo to decide on his new cabinet.\n\nWidodo also has to deal with new police and military clashes with separatist forces in the province of Papua in which at least 30 people were killed.\n\n\u201cThe current situation is undoubtedly not conducive to investment,\u201d Su said. \u201cI find the degree of flash point emergence to be highly unexpected.\u201d", "description": "Foreigners Dump $1.2 Billion of Indonesian Stocks After Weak Growth, Protests", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic8a9ef9f31b992377a5cd532a379ec599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
