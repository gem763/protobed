Trade wars. Negative interest rates. Unprecedented levels of debt. Sagging economic growth and productivity. \u201cGo home,\u201d Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director implored an audience of policy-makers and various hangers-on at one point. \u201cAct. How many of you are going to do it?\u201d\n\nNo one from Canada\u2019s government was there to receive the message, obviously. But now that the election is over, let\u2019s put the question to Canada\u2019s new Parliament: the economy is in trouble; how many of you are ready to do something about it?\n\nWe can put that question to the entire Parliament because Justin Trudeau\u2019s best shot at running a decent government for the next four years will be to proceed bill to bill. As of 4 a.m., Trudeau\u2019s Liberals were leading or elected in 157 ridings, a 36-seat lead over the second-place Conservatives, but 13 short of a majority. That could prove to be a more stable government than many were expecting.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (32 seats) and the New Democratic Party (24 seats) both controlled enough votes to be king makers in the House of Commons. Bloc Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said he was uninterested in being anyone\u2019s formal partner, but would collaborate any legislation that he deemed good for his province. Jagmeet Singh, who revived the NDP\u2019s swagger during the campaign, even though he ultimately lost more than a dozen seats, listed pharmacare, affordable housing, eliminating interest on student loans, a cap on mobile-phone bills, ending oil subsidies, and taxing the \u201csuper wealthy\u201d as his priorities.\n\n\u201cCanadians sent a clear message they want a government that works for them, not the rich and powerful,\u201d Singh said in his post-election speech.\n\nMicheal Hsueh, a foreign-exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank, warned his clients on Oct. 21 that a Liberal tie-up with the NDP would be \u201cmild negative\u201d for the Canadian dollar. If so, the downward pressure likely will last for about as long as it takes traders to recall why they invested in Canadian assets in the first place. The 10-year bond was yielding about 1.6 per cent on Election Day, a little less than the comparable U.S. security, but much better than the negative yields on offer in Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n\nHsueh said the NDP\u2019s opposition to the Trans-Mountain pipeline could give investors a scare. I suspect that would be nothing like the chill Singh would experience if confronted with the economic and national-unity implications of actually orchestrating the death of the project, rather than promising to do so while surrounded by partisans at campaign rallies.\n\nRegardless, the parliamentary alignment will make it difficult for Singh to demand too much. Blanchet said he opposed new oil pipelines in Quebec, not British Columbia; the Bloc\u2019s support could come cheaper than that of the NDP. Or the Liberals could simply team with Conservatives to block any legislative effort to reverse existing pipeline construction. Trans Mountain is safe.\n\n\u201cYou are an essential part of our great country,\u201d Trudeau said of Alberta and Saskatchewan, which rejected every Liberal candidate. \u201cLet us all work hard to bring our country together.\u201d\n\nIf the prime minister means it, he will sample from the official opposition\u2019s election platform, and not just the wish books of the Bloc and the NDP.\n\nAndrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, said he would have called a meeting of First Ministers in January to start work on an enhanced internal free-trade agreement; Trudeau could do the same, as the Liberals also promised to get serious about erasing trade barriers between the provinces.\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing Georgieva was talking about when she called on policy-makers to act. The IMF cut its forecast for global growth this year to three per cent, the weakest since the Great Recession in 2009. The trade wars have killed global demand and business confidence, and ultra-low interest rates now provide stability more so than stimulus. \u201cWe\u2019re in a Great Sag,\u201d Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates LP, the world\u2019s biggest hedge fund, said on the same stage as Georgieva.\n\nStronger economic growth will require politicians doing difficult things to encourage growth. The IMF found earlier this year that internal free trade would increase Canada\u2019s GDP per capita by about four per cent, a larger boost than would be generated by the new North American trade agreement. Tax changes also could help. The government and the opposition each said they would cut personal tax rates by about $6 billion per year. The Liberals promised to look at the government\u2019s long list of special-interest tax breaks, while Conservatives pledged a review of the tax code, suggesting a compromise on tax reform could be found. (The Liberals and the NDP agree on taxing automobiles, boats and aircraft that cost more than $100,000.)\n\nHowever, it\u2019s unclear if Trudeau, Scheer and their respective tribes are capable of working together. They come from different worlds. Brendon Bernard, a former finance economist who now does labour-market research at Indeed, a jobs site, found that ridings won by the NDP and Liberals in 2015 experienced a disproportionate share of the hiring over the past four years, while Conservative areas lagged. Liberals and Conservatives spent the campaign spreading lies and disinformation about the other, and Scheer called Trudeau a \u201cfraud.\u201d On election night, Trudeau broke convention and began his victory speech in Montreal minutes after Scheer had begun addressing his supporters in Regina, denying the opposition leader a moment on live television.\n\n\u201cCanada is a country that is further divided,\u201d the broadcast audience eventually heard Scheer say.\n\nThose divisions don\u2019t look so serious on paper: the Liberal platform features numerous items that are similar to promises made by the Conservatives and the NDP. The question, then, is whether the 338 newly elected members of Parliament are humble enough to work together?\n\nTrudeau would have to acknowledge that Conservatives won 34 per cent of the popular vote, compared with about 33 per cent for his Liberals. \u201cConservatives have put Justin Trudeau on notice,\u201d Scheer said. Except that about 65 per cent of voters endorsed parties that support a carbon tax, which Scheer said he would scrap, so the Conservatives were put on notice too.\n\n\u201cThere is enough money to go around,\u201d Dalio said at the IMF meetings. \u201cThe big risk is now we are dealing with each other.\u201d\n\nHe was talking about the United States and Europe, but he could have been talking about Canada, too.\n\n\u2022Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com |", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: The economy is in trouble and it's going to take politicians doing difficult things to encourage growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/canadian-federal-election-results-2019-jagmeet-singh-justin-trudeau-elizabeth-may-maxime-bernier-andrew-scheer-yves-francois-blanchet.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
