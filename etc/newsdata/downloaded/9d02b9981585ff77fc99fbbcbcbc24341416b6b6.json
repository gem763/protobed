In fact, Netflix\u2019s NFLX, -0.45% most recent misses have been followed by strong rebounds in the following period.\n\nAfter missing by 19% in the June 2018 quarter, for example, Netflix rallied to deliver 34% upside to consensus estimates in the following quarter. And while the company posted a 7% miss in March 2017, it crushed forecasts by 61% three months later. The company failed to exceed Wall Street\u2019s projections for net additions five times from June 2014 to September 2018, with none of those coming in the same calendar year, according to MarketWatch analysis of FactSet data.\n\nR ead: Netflix stock battered as investors await a flood of new competitors\n\nStarting with the December 2018 quarter, Netflix began shifting Wall Street\u2019s attention to its paid net additions metric, a count that doesn\u2019t include free-trial subscribers. That\u2019s where Netflix posted a massive disappointment in its most recent report, delivering only 2.7 million new subscribers globally after projecting 5 million additions.\n\nThough the consensus forecast calls for a larger volume of net additions in Wednesday\u2019s report, analysts have been a largely pessimistic bunch lately. Netflix\u2019s own outlook calls for 7 million net new subscribers globally, but the FactSet consensus models just 6.7 million and is down by more than 100,000 since the end of September, suggesting a lowered bar for the company.\n\nManagement has argued that fluctuations in subscriber growth partly reflect the strength of Netflix\u2019s new content in a given quarter, with new second-quarter programming proving underwhelming in terms of subscriber momentum, especially after a very strong start to the year. Results from the third quarter, which Netflix is about to report, likely benefitted from the release of Season 3 of \u201cStranger Things\u201d in July, and the key question is whether that hit title helped drive new members to Netflix\u2019s platform.\n\nSee also: As Netflix earnings nears, here comes an onslaught of competition \u2014 and content\n\nNetflix\u2019s earnings promise to be one of the high points of Wednesday\u2019s docket as a last hurrah of sorts before Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.23% , Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.05% and others formally begin their streaming advances. Joining Netflix in the world of Big Tech earnings Wednesday is International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.68% , and investors will be looking to gauge the performance of IBM\u2019s legacy business on its own, prior to factoring in contributions from its recently closed Red Hat deal.\n\nAfter J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +3.01% and Goldman Sachs GS, +0.31% kicked off a parade of bank earnings on Tuesday morning, Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.02% will be the headliner from the financials sector on Wednesday, with PNC Financial Services Group Inc. PNC, +0.96% , U.S. Bancorp USB, +0.94% and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, +1.02% also scheduled to report. Goldman Sachs bemoaned a weak underwriting landscape while J.P. Morgan cheered its performance Tuesday, suggesting an uneven environment for financial companies.", "description": "The streaming-media giant posted a huge subscriber miss in its last earnings report, but has never fallen short on that closely watched metric in...", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HI055_netfli_ZG_20190422153716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
