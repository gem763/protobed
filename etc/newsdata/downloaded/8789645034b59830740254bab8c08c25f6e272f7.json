A snap election will resolve nothing and could prolong the agony.\"\n\nCorbyn warns colleagues against immediate referendum\n\nLeader of Britain's opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, is seen during a visit to Chingford, London Reuters\n\nBut Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dealt a blow to hopes of a second referendum on Sunday when he indicated Labour would not support the plan.\n\nAsked by Sophie Ridge on Sky News whether MPs would be more likely to support a deal if it was put to a public vote, Corbyn said: \"I think many in parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be inclined to support it, because they don't really agree with the deal \u2013 but I would caution them on this.\"\n\nHe said he would instead prefer to see an election, after which a Labour-led government would renegotiate a softer Brexit deal that kept the UK in the customs union.\n\nCorbyn's comments appear to put him at odds with many of his colleagues on the Labour frontbench.\n\nBrexit Secretary Keir Starmer told a conference on Saturday that Labour would press for a public vote to be attached to any deal Johnson negotiated.\n\n\"Next week our priorities are clear: if Boris Johnson does manage to negotiate a deal, then we will insist that it is put back to the people in a confirmatory vote,\" Starmer said.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, also indicated that she would support a second vote on any Brexit deal, telling BBC's Andrew Marrr that she \"had been on a journey in relation to a public vote on Brexit, but the only option now was to let the people decide.\"", "description": "There is a growing belief among Boris Johnson's opponents that they can secure a second Brexit referendum next week.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da300b24af909398849b0a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
