No replacement has been called up at this stage,\" the statement added.\n\nWales have already suffered injury problems with number eight Josh Navidi suffering a grade two hamstring tear in the gripping 20-19 quarterfinal win over France. They called up Cardiff Blues winger Owen Lane, suggesting coach Warren Gatland feels he needs more cover in the backs.\n\nOn the plus side, coach Warren Gatland welcomed back centrer Jonathan Davies, who missed the scrappy quarterfinal against France with a knee injury. Davies will resume his potent midfield partnership with New Zealand-born Hadleigh Parkes.\n\nScrum-half Gareth Davies wins his 50th cap and will link up again with Dan Biggar as a half-back combination.\n\nThe Springboks have their own injury concerns in the back three, with star wing Cheslin Kolbe out of the semifinal, also with an ankle injury.\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus has again gone for a forwards-dominated 6-2 split in the replacements, suggesting they will seek to overpower the Welsh up front. The Springboks outmuscled Japan with a ferocious defensive display in the quarterfinals before running out 26-3 winners.\n\nWales had to grind out their win over France, who had to play the last half-hour with 14 men after Sebastien Vahaamahina was sent off for elbowing Welsh flanker Aaron Wainwright.\n\nWales team: Leigh Halfpenny, George North, Jonathan Davies, Hadleigh Parkes, Josh Adams, Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Ross Moriarty, Justin Tipuric, Aaron Wainwright, Alun Wyn Jones, Jake Ball, Tomas Francis, Wyn Jones.
