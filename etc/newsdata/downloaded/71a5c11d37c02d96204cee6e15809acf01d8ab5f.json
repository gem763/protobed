Sheerin first had an inkling he was famous.\n\nAs the genial tour guide, who has been brightening up afternoons on Channel 4 since 2005, recalls, \u2018The first time I realised, \u201cOooh my goodness, this is a popular programme,\u201d was when all the immigration officers were like, \u201cHey, it\u2019s Brendan from Coach Trip.\u201d\u2019\n\nBefore receiving a call out of the blue asking him to audition for the show, Brendan was a semi-retired tour guide working in Scarborough.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/Shutterstock)\n\n\u2018Never in a million years did I think I\u2019d actually get the job,\u2019 he remembers.\n\nBrendan, 60, is wearing a dark blue shirt and a warm smile when we meet.\n\nAs he offers us some luxury chocolates, it\u2019s clear he has a knack for putting people at ease \u2013 which he\u2019ll need as he corrals another bunch of passengers, including jungle queen Vicky Pattison and Steps star Ian \u2018H\u2019 Watkins, in the new series of Celebrity Coach Trip.\n\nHe happily admits he\u2019s not always familiar with the celeb version\u2019s roster of reality stars.\n\n\u2018On many occasions I don\u2019t know who they are because I don\u2019t watch their type of programme,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I prefer documentaries.\n\n\u2018But I aways ask them a few questions about it.\u2019\n\nWith participation being the name of the Coach Trip game, Brendan\u2019s job is made much easier when people whole-heartedly embrace the concept.\n\n\u2018My favourite passengers are always the ones who throw themselves into the activities 150% \u2013 whatever it is or whatever age they are.\n\n\u2018Whether it\u2019s abseiling or paragliding.\u2019\n\n\u2018The other end of the spectrum is when people have been on the coach a bit too long and start to get a bit blas\u00e9.\n\n\u2018They take things for granted.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll say, \u201cThis morning we\u2019re going pottery making!\u201d and they\u2019ll go, \u201cUgggh.\u201d\n\n\u2018Do you know what I mean?\n\n\u2018We can\u2019t go gliding or up in aeroplanes every day!\u2019 he laughs.\n\n(Image: ENTERPRISE NEWS AND PICTURES)\n\nAs for whether he prefers shepherding regular people or celebs on the coach, Brendan muses that he enjoys helping Joe Public face their fear of heights through activities like abseiling.\n\nBut he adds with a mischievous glint in his eye, \u2018With celebs it\u2019s entirely different because if you ask them to dance they\u2019ll dance for you, won\u2019t they?\u2019\n\nHe grew up in Leeds, but sun worshipper Brendan is now happily based in Spain.\n\n\u2018I learnt Spanish when I went out to work as a courier.\n\n\u2018It was only a summer job and then I ended up staying.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve lived in Torremolinos for about 15 years, I love it,\u2019 he beams.\n\n\u2018I love the weather and it\u2019s my little rest and unwind when I\u2019m not doing Coach Trip.\u2019\n\nBrendan regularly socialises with friends and family, but lost his partner Les several years ago.\n\n\u2018Yes, I\u2019m still single,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m widowed, really.\n\n\u2018I had a lovely relationship with Les and we were together for 25 years.\n\n\u2018We lived together in L\u2019Estartit on the Costa Brava for a long time.\n\n\u2018In the early days it was a bit dark because you had to be 21 to have a gay relationship.\u2019\n\nSo Brendan\u2019s thrilled to see the changes in society these days.\n\n\u2018It does my heart good to see two boys holding hands.\n\n\u2018A while ago I was on Regent Street and I saw these two boys and they saw me looking.\n\n\u2018I said, \u201cDo you know, I would have been arrested for doing that when I was young.\u201d\n\n\u2018They just said, \u201cThank you for standing up for gay rights,\u201d because they know the older generation paved the way for the younger one.\n\n\u2018So it gladdens my heart.\u2019\n\n(Image: (Channel 4 images

true professional when he\u2019s on the job.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a time for work and a time for pleasure, and I do not mix both,\u2019 he says.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s in my contract \u2013 no knocking on any doors!\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had offers, don\u2019t get me wrong.\n\n\u2018But it would complicate things terribly, wouldn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nOne of five children, Brendan grew up in a Roman Catholic household.\n\n\u2018I had a lovely childhood, and I did a lot of Irish dancing when I was a kid because most Irish families had someone who played a fiddle or an accordion and I was the dancer,\u2019 he says.\n\nLike many Northern families at the time, his father worked in the industrial sector.\n\nHowever, Brendan is proud of a link between his dad\u2019s trade and his own eventual career in travel.\n\n(Image: Supplied by WENN)\n\n\u2018My dad was an engineer, he used to work for a company that produced blades for turbine engines,\u2019 he recalls.\n\n\u2018In fact, his company produced the turbine engines for Concorde.\n\n\u2018He never got to fly on it, but I did.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m the only supersonic Sheerin in my family!\u2019\n\nThe Sheerin clan may not have been jet-setters, but they always made the most of their holiday time.\n\n\u2018Every year we decamped to Yorkshire or would go to my grandmother\u2019s farm in the middle of Mayo, run havoc in the fields and have a brilliant six weeks of summer holidays,\u2019 says Brendan.\n\n\u2018The whole family would go.\n\n\u2018At Easter my dad would get us a caravan in York and we\u2019d go sightseeing.\n\n\u2018The caravan would be right on the River Ouse, at Acaster Malbis.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d go fishing and have a great time.\u2019\n\nBrendan\u2019s fans might be surprised to know that the king of coaches had his heart set on a very different vocation when he was younger.\n\nIf things had turned out differently, he could well have become Father Brendan.\n\n\u2018I thought I had a calling to the priesthood when I was about 13,\u2019 he muses.\n\n\u2018I was an altar boy and I was one of the favourites because I could do everything, like the incense, or the Smoking Handbag as we called it.\n\n\u2018I was brought up saying Mass, which in those days was in Latin.\u2019\n\nBrendan\u2019s hopes for joining the church were taken seriously enough for bishops and priests to consult him and his father on it.\n\n\u2018It was like a Vatican Council, there were all these priests asking me questions \u2013 did I do sports, what subject did I like at school?\u2019 he remembers.\n\n\u2018My dad wasn\u2019t happy about it, I think he wanted me to go out and see a bit of life before I decided on celibacy and all that carry on.\u2019\n\nWhen Brendan is back in his home town he\u2019s guaranteed to receive a good reaction.\n\n\u2018I do still come home a lot, my family live in Leeds.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not, \u201cOh it\u2019s Brendan from Coach Trip,\u2019 it\u2019s, \u201cEee, it\u2019s our Brendan!\u2019\u2019 he smiles.\n\n\u2018The welcome I get is amazing because I was born and bred there.\u2019\n\n(Image: PLANET PHOTOS)\n\nAlthough Brendan clearly loves his life in Spain, he always makes sure he tops up on home comforts when he\u2019s back in the UK.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll always eat Yorkshire pudding and roast beef when I\u2019m back.\n\n\u2018I have a fat rascal, which is a big fat scone, at Betty\u2019s in Harrogate with my agent Paula.\n\n\u2018I also love Galaxy chocolate.\n\n\u2018My friends fly out to Spain with it, they have orders!\u2019 he laughs.\n\nHis skill at helping the Coach Trip passengers to relax and enjoy the experience is one he learned very early on.\n\n\u2018When I started as a courier in Spain I used to go to the airport every week and you\u2019d have a Lord and Lady coming through alongside a miner from Barnsley.\n\n\u2018Now, I couldn\u2019t treat them any different, even though the Lady probably had seven hat boxes going round on the carousel with her luggage and the poor couple from Barnsley didn\u2019t,\u2019 he muses.\n\nThey say that if you choose a job you love then you\u2019ll never work a day in your life.\n\nBrendan obviously still gets a kick out of being a tour guide, but warns that it\u2019s not for everybody.\n\n\u2018You do have to be a people person to do the job that I do.\n\n\u2018When it\u2019s an industry dealing with people then you\u2019ve got to be.\n\n\u2018Otherwise don\u2019t bother, get another job!\u2019\n\nHow do you spend your Sunday?\n\n\u25a0 Lie-in or up with the lark?\n\nI sometimes have a quiet morning, a bit of a lazy day, but I do like to get up and swim in the pool in my garden or I might go to the beach for an hour or two.\n\nI usually treat myself to an English newspaper, I like to read one at least once a week.\n\n\u25a0 Telly or book?\n\nI\u2019ll watch NCIS but it\u2019s mostly Spanish shows we get, and I do love reading historical non-fiction, I\u2019ve got two on the go at the moment.\n\nOne\u2019s called Catherine Of Aragon by Giles Tremlett, which is all about her life.\n\nThe other one is Cathedral Of The Sea by a Spanish writer called Ildefonso Falcones, which is all about building this church in Barcelona.\n\n(Image: WENN.com)\n\n\u25a0 Entertain or eat out?\n\nI can cook. I\u2019m a very good cook.\n\nMy signature dish would be Greek lamb cooked very, very slowly in the oven.\n\nAnd I love fish, living on the coast.\n\nSalmon, trout, you can get all that in Spain easily.\n\nBut I\u2019ll often meet some friends for lunch, usually paella because you have paella on a Sunday.\n\nIn the evening I always go up to Malaga on the train and meet Bruno and Juanito, Pepe and all that lot.\n\nWe\u2019ll have some tapas or churros con chocolate, then go for a walk around Malaga.\n\n- Celebrity Coach Trip starts tomorrow, 7.30pm on E4, or catch up on All 4.", "description": "Legendary Channel 4 tour guide Brendan Sheerin, 60, tells all as he chats about the new series of Coach Trip - and how life has changed for young gay people", "authors": ["Adam Beresford", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Shutterstock", "Enterprise News And Pictures", "Channel Images Must Not Be Altered Or Manipulated In Any Way", "Channel Picture Publicity", "Horseferry Road", "London", "Supplied Wenn", "Planet Photos"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20394667.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_CCT-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
