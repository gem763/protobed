While not rubber stamping the country as bad, she argued the justice system is broken.\n\nDescribing the conditions she faced during her months-long detention, Butina said that being placed in solitary confinement was \u201cthe most terrifying experience\u201d of her life.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult when you have this little cell, very cold, just concrete and iron\u2026 Later I learned that by the United Nations, this is considered to be torture. Because it is torture\u2026 I still don\u2019t understand why it was necessary. I guess they were trying to break my will.\n\nHowever, that did not make any sense, Butina explained, sin\u0441e she \"didn\u2019t have any secrets.\"\n\n\"I was just a student, believing in peace-building between the two countries.\"\n\nShe talked about how the outpouring of support from Russians helped keep her sane, and that she struggled to find the time to respond to the flood of letters she received.\n\nDespite her harrowing experience, she said that she still believes in improving relations between the US and Russia, and that there are many \u201cwonderful\u201d Americans that she is still close friends with. She was less optimistic about the US justice system, however.\n\nWhat happened to me definitely shows that America is losing its justice system. It actually has been lost.\n\nGoing forward, she told RT that she wants to continue her gun activism, but will also speak out for prisoners in both Russia and the United States.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018It was very hard to bear\u2019: Maria Butina recalls how US media smeared her on TV & prison guards gathered to watch it\n\nNow that I have world recognition, I feel obligated, I feel responsible, to fight for those who are humiliated, who are unjustly accused, who are today forgotten, here in Russia and especially there in the United States.\n\nShe promised to continue talking about \u201cthe conditions of my imprisonment because a country should be measured on how it treats its prisoners.\u201d\n\nLike this story?
