Through an executive order released in July, Trump directed all federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration, to share their citizenship records with the Commerce Department.\n\n\"I understand that some State officials are interested in such data for districting purposes,\" Trump said in the executive order on collecting citizenship information. \"This order will assist the [Commerce] Department in securing the most accurate and complete citizenship data so that it can respond to such requests from the States.\"\n\nThe White House has not responded to NPR's questions about which state officials the president was referring to in the executive order.\n\nThe Commerce Department's Office of Public Affairs has also not responded to NPR's questions about Ross' decision to order the data produced.\n\nOne notable reason for citizenship data that is not mentioned in the executive order is enforcing the Voting Rights Act protections against the discrimination of racial and language minorities. Throughout the legal battle over the now-blocked citizenship question, the administration used that civil rights-era law as its stated motivation \u2014 a rationale that federal courts rejected, with one judge calling it a \"sham justification.\"\n\nThe order does reference a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Evenwel v. Abbott that left unresolved whether it is legal for states to redraw legislative districts based on the number of eligible voters in an area rather than all residents.\n\n\"We need not and do not resolve whether, as Texas now argues, States may draw districts to equalize voter-eligible population rather than total population,\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote on behalf of the court majority.\n\nThat decision set up this issue for a future Supreme Court fight, and the Trump administration's efforts around citizenship data have helped pave the path to a potential political battle.\n\nThe bureau's chief scientist, John Abowd, recently announced that by next March the bureau plans to finalize how it will release the citizenship data in 2021.", "description": "The Trump administration ordered the Census Bureau to produce citizenship data state officials can use when redrawing voting districts.
