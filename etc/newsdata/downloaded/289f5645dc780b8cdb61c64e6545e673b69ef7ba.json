Limited in power, the caretaker government was unable to rein in a gaping budget hole that grew to nearly 4% of gross domestic product in the last 12 months, versus an initial target of 2.9%.\n\nA national unity government could emerge following Tuesday\u2019s election, in which no single party won a majority. Such a government could be in a position to reduce pressure on state expenses, economic analysts said.\n\n\u201cA broad government where no small party has the power to extract what they want for special interest groups makes it easier to make policy for the entire society,\u201d said Karnit Flug, who was Israel\u2019s central bank governor until late last year.\n\nThe budget would be the first challenge, she told Reuters.\n\nOther tricky economic questions will remain, whether Netanyahu continues his record-breaking tenure as prime minister, or is replaced by his rival Benny Gantz, a former military chief.\n\nNo Israeli party has ever won an election outright, so the final outcome will depend on coalition negotiations, a lengthy and expensive process.\n\nFormer Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has emerged as potential kingmaker and favors a unity government with Gantz\u2019s and Netanyahu\u2019s parties.\n\nPreviously, Netanyahu relied on smaller religious parties which gave their support to him in return state handouts, such as costly stipends for seminary students. Those religious parties strengthened their position in Tuesday\u2019s vote, but could be left out of a unity government.\n\nIsrael\u2019s economy is forecast to grow 3.1% in 2019 and as much as 3.5% in 2020. An unchecked deficit would weigh on Israel\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio, which it lowered to 61% in 2018 from 74.6% in 2009.\n\nACTION NEEDED NOW\n\nBank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron warned this month that the deficit was too high to allow further growth and that cost cuts and tax increases were needed.\n\n\u201cOur economy is still in a good position to make changes in order to reduce the deficit, and we need to make them now,\u201d Finance Ministry chief economist Shira Greenberg said last week.\n\nShe advised the government not to be too aggressive in closing the gap because the Bank of Israel, whose benchmark interest rate stands at 0.25%, has less maneuverability to help stave off a potential slowdown.\n\nFlug, who is now vice president at the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank, said the economy was projected to keep growing near its potential and that the deficit should be \u201cno more than 2.5% of GDP for 2020,\u201d reflecting adjustments of at least 20 billion shekels ($5.7 billion).\n\nThat might be too optimistic for the Finance Ministry, where officials estimate a deficit target of around 2.9% next year, including more modest fiscal moves.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, coalition partners will have to look at the current situation and understand ... 2020 and 2021 are not years we will have extra (funds) to give out,\u201d said Shai Babad, the ministry\u2019s director general.\n\nBabad expects the next government to vote on the new budget for 2020 and 2021 in January, with final parliamentary approval in March.\n\nWhoever is tasked with forming a government will have up to 42 days to entice partners. Generous offers during negotiations can end up being followed by a broad cut across all sectors, economists said.\n\n\u201cUsually that\u2019s how they deal with it. You get, and then suddenly everyone is cut 2%,\u201d said Amir Kahanovich, chief economist for the Excellence Investment House. \u201cIt\u2019s the easy option.\u201d", "description": "Whoever emerges as Israel's prime minister after Tuesday's election will need to rein in a growing budget deficit quickly before it hits economic growth.", "authors": ["Steven Scheer", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431209815&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0TN", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
