When I was 29, I was tested and discovered that my mother had passed on her BRCA2 mutation to me. I decided to have a preventive double mastectomy, which shrank my risk of developing breast cancer from 80 percent to less than 5 percent.\n\nEven if a person decides not to do what I did, enhanced surveillance, like an MRI and mammogram every six months, can help detect cancer at an early stage when it\u2019s more treatable. If black women and men aren\u2019t receiving genetic testing, they\u2019re potentially missing out on the chance to catch breast cancer early on. This is crucial because black women are more likely than white women get diagnoses of breast cancer at a later stage, which has lower survival rates. Similarly, black men are also more likely than white men to be told they have prostate cancer when it has reached a more advanced stage.\n\nAs the use of personalized medicine and genomics in treating cancer increases, knowing whether a patient has a BRCA mutation allows for individualized treatment. It also lets the patient to take steps to prevent a recurrence or a second cancer elsewhere. For example, once my mother learned that she carried a BRCA2 mutation, which is also associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer, she underwent an oophorectomy. She has been cancer-free for 12 years.\n\nKnowing that a person carries a BRCA mutation also provides an opportunity to test and identify relatives who may carry a harmful mutation \u2014 potentially preventing and detecting cancer early in a whole family.\n\nWe need a large-scale effort to improve genetic counseling and increase testing rates in the black community. The first step is to make medical providers more aware that black women and men are at risk for carrying BRCA mutations. Numerous studies have shown that the biggest indicator of whether someone undergoes genetic testing is a recommendation from a doctor.\n\nAn educational effort would also help to dispel myths that genetic testing is financially prohibitive. Most insurance will cover the costs of testing for people who meet the national guidelines. When I underwent testing in 2014, I paid only $80 after insurance kicked in.\n\nCancer awareness organizations also need to do a better job of reaching out to the black community about BRCA mutations and the benefits of genetic counseling and testing. Research shows that black women are highly interested in undergoing testing for BRCA mutations once they are presented with information regarding its benefits.", "description": "An inherited gene that can be discovered early caused Matthew Knowles\u2019s breast cancer.", "authors": ["Erika Stallings"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16Stallings/16Stallings-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
