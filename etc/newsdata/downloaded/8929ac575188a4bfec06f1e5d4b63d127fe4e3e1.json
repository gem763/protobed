This month she dropped her fourth album, titled after her middle name, Hilda.\n\nOpening track Blessing is full of sass; Mauboy sings \u201cYou should know that I\u2019m a blessing/I\u2019m not gonna waste a breath on you/You should\u2019ve known I was your best and/I don\u2019t wanna save a prayer for you,\u201dover a finger click-heavy R\u2019n\u2019B track.\n\nMusically, the record feels a bit predictable: Come Runnin\u2019 plays with the pop sounds of Clean Bandit, Selfish is very Ed Sheeran-esque, and EDM banger Who We\u2019re Meant To Be, although decent, is more like a Miley Cyrus song. But there are some quirky moments \u2013 like the synth-pop track Better, and the groove-sounding Jealous.\n\nVideo of Jessica Mauboy - Little Things\n\nLead single Little Things sees Mauboy recall her Aussie Idol days with an over-emotive piano ballad, but it\u2019s Butterfly that feels most sincere. The track gradually evolves instrumentally and emotionally into a weighty but catchy, heartfelt tune, and alongside optimistic closer Wish You Well, is one of the record\u2019s highlights.\n\nThis comeback certainly isn\u2019t ground-breaking, but it\u2019s her ability to pack in dense lyrical passages alongside memorable melodies, that show us the full extent of Mauboy\u2019s talent.\n\n", "description": "The record feels a bit predictable, but shows that she's still going strong after 'Australian Idol'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/fd5c4a4a-f60c-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires180433.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
