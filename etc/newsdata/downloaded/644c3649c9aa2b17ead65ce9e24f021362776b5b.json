It delves into some of the relatively recent history that has shaped the current unrest in the city. The highlight of the piece might be this stunning admission from an anonymous Chinese government official:\n\n\u201cThank goodness we didn\u2019t give them democracy in 2014, it would be so much harder for us to get out of this mess now if we had,\u201d a Chinese government official tells me over the summer, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job. \u201cUniversal suffrage isn\u2019t going to happen for a very long time, if ever at all,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe official is referring to previous protests in 2014 which became known as the Umbrella Movement. At the time, protesters limited themselves to peaceful actions, which made them easy for authorities to handle. One of the protesters who participated in those protests as a college student told FT, \u201cDuring Umbrella, we didn\u2019t escalate our protests so we failed. It was stupid \u2014 we sat, holding hands, waiting for the police to take us away one by one. It\u2019s kind of funny to look back on it now.\u201d\n\nThe current protests which began in June have been much more aggressive. Some protesters are vandalizing public property and in some cases even setting fires. That has resulted in a crackdown from the police. Two teenagers have been shot and several Hong Kong policemen have been injured.\n\nThe person considered most directly responsible for the change in tone is Edward Leung Tin-Kei (pictured above). Last year, Leung was convicted of rioting in an incident that took place in 2016. He was sentenced to six years. A documentary was made about Leung and while it has played in various venues around the city, no commercial theater will show it. \u201cExecutives don\u2019t want to get into trouble. Maybe they aren\u2019t against you or the whole movement in general but they are too scared to do what should be allowed in a normal society,\u201d the filmmaker tells FT. (That sounds sort of familiar.)\n\nLeung has become a touchstone for the protesters. He\u2019s the person who coined the phrase, \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times.\u201d That\u2019s the same phrase that got a Hong Kong gamer in trouble with Blizzard Entertainment recently.\n\nFor Keith Fong, the union\u2019s president, Leung embodies traditional Chinese virtues such as sacrificing for the greater good. \u201cThe sense I get is most people our age support independence but people in their thirties and forties don\u2019t. There are two overwhelming emotions among our generation \u2014 helplessness and this sense of \u2018if we burn, you burn with us\u2019,\u201d Fong tells me\u2026 At high school, Fong\u2019s history teachers told him about the Tiananmen Square massacre and as troops massed on the mainland border of Hong Kong this summer, it was impossible not to draw parallels between then and now. \u201cAll the virtue and history embodied in traditional Chinese culture has been destroyed by the Chinese Communist party,\u201d he says with a shrug. He has been arrested twice, including for possession of offensive weapons in August after he purchased 10 laser pens, popular among protesters who use them to disorient police and deter passers-by from taking photographs that might identify protesters.\n\nThey have adopted some of the same tactics\u2014masks, protecting their identities\u2014as Antifa. The difference is the quote above. Antifa members live in far-left enclaves in one of the freest societies on the planet. They have lots of other options to advocate for change. That\u2019s not the case in Hong Kong where communist tyranny looms over the lives and futures of young people who wonder how long \u201cone country, two systems\u201d can survive.", "description": "\"Thank goodness we didn\u2019t give them democracy in 2014...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edward-Leung.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
