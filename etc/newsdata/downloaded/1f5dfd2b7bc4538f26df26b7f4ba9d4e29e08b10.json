The Oscars of Pizza awards if you will.\n\nREAD: What a cannabis pizza tastes like\n\nNaturally, the awards took place in the very birthplace of pizza itself, Naples, Italy.\n\nWhat makes this award so significant is that for the first time since the 50 Top Pizza awards was established three years ago, it recognised an African pizzeria as one of the world's top 50.\n\nNot just African, but South African!\n\nThe pizzeria has a cosy, authentic feel and caters to carnivores, veggies, kiddies and even has a doggy menu! Pizza for all!\n\nOpened in 2009 by owner Massimo Orione, the wood-fired, authentic Italian-style pizzas have high ratings of 4 and 5 out of 5 stars on reviewer websites like TripAdvisor.\n\nOne reviewer says, \"Having recently moved to Hout Bay it was imperative that my wife and I found a local pizzeria we could write home about. My goodness did Massimo\u2019s deliver, one of the best pizza\u2019s I\u2019ve ever had. We weren\u2019t lucky enough to meet the man himself but I\u2019m sure we will soon! Don\u2019t hesitate to book, it\u2019s a great experience. It\u2019ll be a regular dinner date for us from now on!\"\n\nMAPPED:Treat yourself to a foodie road trip filled with traditional Italian treats\n\nWatch the award ceremony here:", "description": "Weekend plans sorted!
