Positive DNA identification is just 90 minutes away.\n\nTAMPA \u2014 Fingerprints are so 20th-century. For special operations forces conducting midnight raids in places like Pakistan or Syria, DNA is becoming the gold standard.\n\nOn Wednesday, representatives from the U.S. Special Operations Command revealed that they were testing two rapid DNA readers in forward locations. The operators feed in a DNA sample, and the reader compares it against a database that matches DNA to identities. The machines weigh some 60 pounds, so they aren\u2019t small. And they aren\u2019t cheap: each costs about $250,000. But they can give a result in 90 minutes, a process that used to take weeks.\n\n\u201cThese things are downrange and we\u2019re spending a year gathering data \u2014 on the utility, on how well is it working, the match rate, how well are the operators keeping them up and running,\u201d said Michael S. Fitz, manager of the Sensitive Site Exploitation Special Reconnaissance, Surveillance & Exploitation program at U.S. Special Operations Command. He said that because the program was so new, \u201cwe\u2019re saving it for the juicy missions.\u201d\n\nThe devices are the RapidHIT 200 from IntegenX, a California-based company, and the DNAscan from Massachusetts-based NetBIO. Both are about the size of a copier, but compared to an entire DNA lab, require far less manpower. A single operator can get quick results. \u201cIn the past, when we captured DNA, the guy would put it in an envelope, send it back to the States and two or three weeks later, he would get a result on who it was that he had. By then, he moved on to other missions and he had forgotten who the guy was,\u201d said Fitz.\n\nWhat will they use them for? Verifying the identity of targets, either before raids or after the fact. \u201cOur whole program is built around follow-on targeting. We don\u2019t gather biometrics for criminal prosecution,\u201d Fitz said. \u201cOur primary objective is actionable intelligence for follow-on targeting.\u201d Think back to the Osama Bin Laden raid, where the terrorist mastermind\u2019s identity was confirmed via DNA analysis, according to documents leaked by Edward Snowden. In the future, virtually all terrorist suspects and insurgents killed by special operations teams could receive the same treatment.\n\nThe private market is actually full of interesting DNA-verification equipment. But most gear is too big, expensive, and delicate \u2014 hardly \u201cdesigned for that forward-deployed location,\u201d said Fitz.\n\nUltimately, he wants a rugged, battery-powered DNA reader the size of a cellphone, which will allow special operations fighters to \u201ccollect DNA right there on the site.\u201d It should connect to a database to allow verification on location as well.\n\nSuch a device might be available for field-testing around 2019 or 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s a ways out\u201d said Benji Hutchinson, senior director of federal business for MophoTrust, a company that markets the IntegenX. It would \u201crequire a major lift,\u201d he said.\n\nShrinking the technology is just one obstacle to a hand-held DNA matching system. Perhaps more important is growing the database of DNA samples to match against.\n\n\u201cRight now the database is a criminal database: U.S. people. We haven\u2019t been collecting DNA, in part because it\u2019s been a cumbersome and lengthy process to do that. There was no reason for the units to go out and collect DNA because the results were so slow,\u201d Fitz said. He described Defense Department\u2019s DNA database as \u201cnot robust; not populated with the people we\u2019re interested in\u2026Right now, rapid DNA is about where fingerprints were 10 or 12 years ago.\u201d\n\nDuring the height of U.S. operations in Afghanistan, the military fielded a device to take fingerprints, iris scans, and photos of people with whom troops came in contact. It was called the Biometrics Automated Toolset, and its data went on to populate the Defense Department\u2019s Automated Biometric Identification System.\n\n\u201cWhen we first went out with fingerprints we got about a 5 percent match rate. Now we\u2019ve populated the database, so we get 40 percent match,\u201d said Fitz. He hopes DNA matching will show the same rapid improvement. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d he said.", "description": "Conducting a midnight SEAL raid on a terrorist compound?
