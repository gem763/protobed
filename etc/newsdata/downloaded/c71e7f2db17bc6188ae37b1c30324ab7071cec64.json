Roberts Jr. joining the court\u2019s liberals. He had dissented in the 2016 decision.\n\nThe meaning of Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s vote to block the Louisiana law is contested, and it is hardly certain he will vote to uphold the law on the merits. Instead, he might have meant only to ensure an orderly process in which the Supreme Court, rather than an appellate panel, makes the momentous decision of whether to limit or overrule a recent Supreme Court precedent.\n\nOther abortion cases are likely to follow the one from Louisiana, as several state legislatures have enacted laws that seem calculated to try to force the Supreme Court to consider overruling Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. Mr. Trump has vowed to appoint justices who will vote to the overrule the decision.\n\nThe Louisiana law was struck down in 2017 by Judge John W. deGravelles of the Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, who said that doctors willing to perform abortions were often unable to obtain admitting privileges for reasons unrelated to their competence and that the law created an undue burden on women\u2019s constitutional right to abortion.\n\nThe law, Judge deGravelles ruled, was essentially identical to one from Texas that the Supreme Court struck down in the 2016 decision, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt. Justice Stephen G. Breyer, writing for the majority in that decision, said courts must consider whether the claimed benefits of laws that put restrictions on abortion outweigh the burdens they put on the constitutional right to the procedure.", "description": "The case will test the constitutionality of an admitting-privileges law that could reduce the number of clinics in the state one.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/us/politics/04dc-scotus-abort-promo/04dc-scotus-abort-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
