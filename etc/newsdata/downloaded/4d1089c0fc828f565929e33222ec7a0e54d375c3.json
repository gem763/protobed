The Philadelphia Federal Reserve also said Thursday its gauge of business activity fell to 5.6 in October from 12 in September, but the downbeat data didn\u2019t stop the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% from ending within 1% of its all-time high.\n\nEarlier this month, New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said the \u201coutlook is actually very favorable,\u201d for the U.S. economy, during a talk a the University of California, San Diego.\n\nStill, Forester at Lockwood Advisors said the recent shift out of an inverted yield curve was a worrying sign of a looming recession, even if others disagree.\n\nCheck out: The yield curve is no longer inverted. But some still see an impending recession\n\n\u201cIn each of the last three cycles, the yield curve was well on the way tightening before we actually entered a recession,\u201d Forester said. \u201cThis tends to happen in every cycle \u2014 we get a signal and people rationalize and explain why it may not be valid.\u201d", "description": "Investors say fears of credit-ratings downgrades to debt-laden companies is a top concern as the U.S. economy shows signs of weakening", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT571_standa_ZG_20191017204339.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
