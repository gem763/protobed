The project's price fell off a cliff last week, falling more than 20 percent from $10,026 last Sunday to today\u2019s price, $7,933.\n\nBakkt is the brainchild of the Intercontinental Exchange, the organization that runs the New York Stock Exchange. On Bakkt, investors could bet on the future price of Bitcoin, and place and receive those bets in Bitcoin, too. Experts hoped Bakkt would bring Wall Street money to Bitcoin because it has the backing of Wall Street\u2019s regulators, like the CTFC.\n\nWhile the JP Morgan report noted that the Bakkt contracts are a welcomed sign of the crypto market growing up, trading has been relatively underwhelming. Right now, just 54 Bitcoin is being traded ($430,000). Not much considering the hype.\n\nBut the JP Morgan report suggested that \u201cIt may be that the listing of physically settled futures contracts (that enables some holders of physical Bitcoin e.g. miners to hedge exposures) has contributed to recent price declines, rather than the low initial volumes,\u201d JPMorgan\u2019s analyst wrote in the report, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe report said that Bitcoin\u2019s price peaked a while ago, and the market only just started suffering as old deals, excitedly made from the ambitions of Bitcoin\u2019s bull run, finish up. \u201cThis position liquidation has also likely contributed to the sharp falls in Bitcoin prices this week,\u201d said the report.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price has got rid of the \u201coverhang of long Bitcoin futures positions...in Bitmex futures, this is not yet true for CME contracts,\u201d said the report. In other words, though the reasons for last week\u2019s misery have cleared up, the completion of over-valued CME contracts in the coming weeks and months could further depress the Bitcoin market. Hold on to your hats.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bitcoin dropped 20 percent in the past week.
