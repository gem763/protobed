Apply within.", "language": "en", "text": "The line between an epic ego boost and a nightmare from a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode, it seems, has never been thinner.\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement posted online, Geomiq says the robotics company \u2014 which remains unnamed due to an apparent non-disclosure agreement \u2014 isn\u2019t looking for just any old face, but a \u201ckind and friendly\u201d one that will may be reproduced \u201con potentially thousands of versions of the robots worldwide,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nAD\n\nThe blog post doesn\u2019t specify whether designers are seeking a particular age or gender for their robotic face.\n\nGeomiq notes that theirs is a \u201cunique request.\u201d As if trying to outdo that understatement, the company points out that licensing one\u2019s face to a humanoid robotic project of unknown origin is, after all, \u201cpotentially an extremely big decision.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPotentially, indeed.\n\nBut, they add, a nearly $130,000 enticement awaits the bold individual who agrees to let the robotics company license their visage, likely altering the course of their life forever.\n\nBecause the Internet is an unregulated house of mirrors patrolled by piratical tricksters who traffic in flimflam, it\u2019s unclear whether Geomiq\u2019s request is a daring social experiment, a prank, or a legitimate plea for assistance. The firm\u2019s statement includes a semi-detailed explanation for their client\u2019s secrecy.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe company is privately-funded and says the robots\u2019 purpose will be to act as a \u2018virtual friend\u2019 for elderly people, and is set to go into production next year,\u201d the statement says. \u201cThe designer has said that the project has been in development for five years, and has since taken on investment from a number of independent VCs as well as a top fund based in Shanghai.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe company says the need for anonymity is due to the \u2018secretive\u2019 nature of the project, however it believes the robot will soon be \u2018readily available\u2019 to the public and hopes the campaign will create extra buzz ahead of its eventual release,\u201d the statement adds.\n\nThe company claims that candidates whose faces advance to the the next phase of the selection process can expect full transparency about the nature of the robotics project.\n\nAD\n\nNot sure if your face is worthy of gracing a robot army? Don\u2019t fret. There\u2019s already a seemingly endless variety of robot faces on the market today, their design often reflective of the machine\u2019s purpose and expected location. Some robots, like the $1 million robotic Buddhist priest, Mindar, have human-like faces, though they\u2019re not always equipped to carry out realistic human expressions.\n\nAD\n\nin Thailand, one hospital has introduced robotic nurses whose faces consist largely of two blazing red eyes \u2014 each one massive and ghoulish \u2014 which glare from behind a darkened pane of transparent plastic like a demonic predator lurking in the dark. The robotic assistant known as Pepper, meanwhile, has a non-threatening face with cartoonishly large eyes that are designed to put people at ease.\n\nIn recent years, a growing number of robots have been developed with faces rendered on a screen, offering designers more flexibility in how they define a robot\u2019s personality. Last year, roboticists from the University of Washington in Seattle identified 157 different robots with rendered faces. Researchers categorized the faces according to dozens of attributes and then surveyed people about their reaction to different robotic facial styles.\n\nAD\n\nIn their paper, \u201cCharacterizing the Design Space of Rendered Robot Faces,\" researchers report that the plurality of robot faces are black (34.4 percent) and most (65.6 percent) include a mouth, but less than half have eyebrows and even fewer have a nose. Less than one in 10 robots have hair and even fewer have ears. Most robot eyes are white and circular and generally feature pupils.\n\nAD\n\nThough seemingly innocuous, a robot\u2019s facial features can have an enormous impact on how they\u2019re received by humans, who are hardwired to recognize and closely read faces.\n\n\u201cFaces are critical in establishing the agency of social robots; however, building expressive mechanical faces is costly and difficult,\" the paper states.\n\n\u201cWe find that participants preferred less realistic and less detailed robots in the home, but highly detailed yet not exceedingly realistic robots for service jobs,\" the paper adds. \"The lack of key features like pupils and mouths resulted in low likability ratings and engendered distrust, leading participants to relegate them to security jobs.\u201d\n\nMORE READING:\n\nAD", "description": "A British firm claims its been hired by a mysterious robotics company to find the perfect face for a new fleet of humanoid robots.", "authors": ["Peter Holley", "Technology Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/a87NJbv-YXVcfukbbDlfwaoVALs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CD66RWSTYII6TKUDKBHQQ27V2Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
