That.\n\nThe fashion, beauty, music, and pretty much everything else mogul broke the mold with a runway show during New York Fashion Week earlier this month, which debuted on Amazon Prime Video Friday for all our viewing pleasure.\n\nBut instead of a traditional runway presentation (Victoria\u2019s Secret, please see yourself out) to reveal her new Fall/Winter 2019 collection, Rihanna brought pop culture titans together for an all-inclusive, body-positive and diverse experience second to none.\n\nWith the Hadid sisters, Laverne Cox, Cara Delevingne and more stomping down the runway, it was a legends-only affair and, of course, Normani fit right in, leaving just about everybody on the floor with a jaw-dropping dance performance.\n\nMid-way through the show, the \u201cMotivation\u201d singer appeared in a printed bra and underwear ready to showcase her unparalleled moves with a group of dancers to the tune of Sean Paul\u2019s \u201cGet Busy.\u201d\n\ngood morning to normani destroying \u2018get busy\u2019 \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 pic.twitter.com/zPXicG3fEI \u2014 G (@oneofthosefaces) September 20, 2019\n\nFans on social media almost universally agreed that the 23-year-old singer stole the show, which also featured performances by Big Sean, Halsey, DJ Khaled and Migos, singing her praises and on social media.\n\nNormani was EASILY the best part of the Savage x Fenty Fashion Show and that\u2019s all I have to say pic.twitter.com/VoxcUL92rv \u2014 Riley Jay (@Ryan_Debra) September 20, 2019\n\nnormani in the savage x fenty show. legendary behavior. pic.twitter.com/TbxWkTvuX9 \u2014 do\u00f1a chayo (@ericdamianlo) September 20, 2019\n\nNormani is amazing.

And with someone like Normani, you know, she\u2019s an incredible dancer, and dance is athleticism. Dance is powerful. It would be a shame to miss out on the opportunity to have that kind of beauty and power in the show.\u201d\n\nNormani, who first appeared on the scene as a member of the now-disbanded girl group Fifth Harmony, has become a cultural force as of late, releasing her first official single \u201cMotivation\u201d and its accompanying music video to much acclaim.", "description": "The \"Motivation\" singer stole the show and then some during the Savage X Fenty runway presentation.", "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d850c10210000aa00e550d2.jpeg?cache=pvjydzyi3e&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
