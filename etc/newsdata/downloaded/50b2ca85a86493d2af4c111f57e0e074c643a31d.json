You could open a garden-variety savings account, but your interest might be microscopic. A high-interest or high-yield savings account is smarter, but an even better option is a certificate of deposit, or CD.\n\nWhile the top rates on high-yield savings accounts are currently topping 2%, you can find CDs paying more than 3%. But to earn that kind of interest, you better believe that you're going to have to give the bank something in return.\n\nHow CDs work\n\nNiglayNik / Shutterstock\n\nWhen you put your money into a CD, you agree to let the bank hold it for a certain period of time.\n\nMore\n\nSo, here's the not-so-fine print with CDs: You'll have to agree to let the bank hold on to your money for months or years. That's called the CD's term.\n\nYou might choose to stash your money away in six-month, two-year or five-year CDs. Normally, the longer the term, the higher the interest rate.\n\nThe potential payout from a long-term CD might be very enticing. Who doesn't want to earn better returns?\n\nBut you may have to lock your money away for a loooooooong time.\n\nIf some financial emergency comes along and you need to get at your money, tapping your CDs could be costly.\n\nThe risks with CDs\n\ndesigner491 / Shutterstock\n\nYou'll face penalties if you try to withdraw money from your CDs too early.\n\nMore\n\nYeah, we know \u2014 we said at the beginning that CDs were risk-free. That's true in one sense: You can put up to $250,000 in CDs and will never lose that money as long as your account is with a bank insured by FDIC or a credit union insured by NCUA.\n\nBut if you go back on your bargain with the institution and need to withdraw your money early, you'll face the risk of penalties. The rules vary, but generally you'll have to give up a chunk of your interest.\n\nFor example, if you close out a one-year CD too soon, you could say goodbye to six months' worth of interest. If you've had the CD only two months, the penalty would eat into your original deposit amount. Ouch!\n\nThe early withdrawal penalty for a five-year CD might be a full year of interest.\n\nAnother risk is that interest rates might rise while you've got your money locked up, and your savings will miss out on the opportunity to earn better returns.\n\nDifferent flavors of CDs, laddering\n\ntommaso79 / Shutterstock\n\nA CD ladder can help you take advantage of rising interest rates.\n\nMore\n\nStory continues", "description": "You'll earn better interest, if you can deal with having your money locked up for months or years.", "authors": ["Doug Whiteman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/S8fp.sQgepIXfgYtC0R7IQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/moneywise_327/d00ca6eaed872229af153f6573341d1b"}
