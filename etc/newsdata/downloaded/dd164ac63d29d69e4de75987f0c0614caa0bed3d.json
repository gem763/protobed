The state is trying to find out why.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s cute, that\u2019s real cute, City of Sacramento, letting people like that work in your state buildings,\" said one passerby, adding an expletive, in a video of the office window he uploaded to Imgur. The caption reads, \u201cThis is a trashy way to represent this beautiful city, especially in a state building.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe flag hung above a pair of SS bolts, a white supremacist symbol inspired by Nazi Germany\u2019s police force, and other symbols of hate, said Michael Johnson, the man who local media said made the video, which has been viewed tens of thousands of times.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to be close to the building at all,\" Johnson told TV outlet KTLA. \"People driving by could see it.\u201d\n\nJohnson said he took the video on Friday night. By Monday morning, the display was removed and the corrections department had launched an internal investigation.\n\nThe agency said the building, a parole office that deals with high-risk sex offenders and gang members, may by its very nature house offensive and obscene items, but officials said that\u2019s no excuse for the display and they\u2019re still trying to figure out why some of those accoutrements were placed prominently in a street-facing window.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe flag has been removed, and we apologize for this profoundly incendiary act,\u201d said Dana Simas, the department press secretary. \u201cThe display of an image representing violence and bigotry is a gross violation of department policy. ... Those found in violation of the department\u2019s policies will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe said the room, reported elsewhere as someone\u2019s personal office, is actually an agent training space. The instruction sometimes covers how to identify certain types of paraphernalia \u2014 including hate symbols \u2014 but the agency is still investigating whether the Nazi flag and other items were included in such a training session, Simas said.\n\nIf that was the case, it wasn\u2019t clear to the pedestrians or drivers who traveled through the busy intersection in front of the building and passed the window.\n\nAD\n\n\"That type of, you know, context was not included whatsoever,\u201d Johnson told KTLA.\n\nAt this point, Simas said, it\u2019s unclear why and for how long the flag hung next to the window. She said the department has never had a problem like this, but she understands why people are upset.\n\nThe agency, she said, has \u201ca zero-tolerance policy for the display of objects that are derogatory in nature.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The California agency has launched an internal investigation.", "authors": ["Reis Thebault", "National", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/YnkGklwxmhNyC-bKvtTd5zVBoM0=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-29-2019/t_13aaa6c0e1554c73ade3a186d407bdab_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_00_45_17_Still014.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
