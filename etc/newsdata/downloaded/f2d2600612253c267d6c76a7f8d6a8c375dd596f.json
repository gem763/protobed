When a player jumps before there is contact it is not a penalty,\u201d Klopp said.\n\nKlopp then wondered aloud how the referees came to the decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the best loser but I\u2019m not a bad loser. It was a decision made by human beings. As long as human beings make the decisions there is potential for failure. The referees and the VAR were all German, and they have experience with the VAR in Germany,\u201d said Klopp, who is also German. \u201cI\u2019m sure they will find an explanation on why they did the right thing.\u201d\n\nStill, Klopp was not altogether discouraged.\n\n\u201cThat was the game changer tonight and we have to accept the result,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are really critical with ourselves but it was not a really, really bad performance.\u201d\n\nThe latest chapter in what is becoming an intense rivalry between the two attack-minded clubs, which also met in last season\u2019s group phase, was full of action.\n\nThe atmosphere inside the newly renovated Stadio San Paolo was electric from the start as both sides attacked relentlessly from the opening whistle.\n\n\u201cIt was very balanced match,\u201d Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best squad in Europe and they were again tonight, because they forced us to be extraordinary.\u201d\n\nLiverpool became the first reigning champion to lose its opening game since AC Milan was beaten by Ajax in 1994.\n\nLast season, Napoli also beat Liverpool 1-0 at home before the English side won by the same score in England - denying Napoli a place in the knockout rounds.\n\nNapoli and Salzburg, which routed Genk 6-2, took the early lead in Group E.\n\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s not decisive,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cGive us at least a few more games to change the table.\u201d\n\nNapoli countered Liverpool\u2019s established attacking trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Man\u00e9 with a lineup featuring four forwards: Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon on the wings surrounding Dries Mertens and Hirving Lozano.\n\nSalah was on full sprint from kickoff but couldn\u2019t find a way past Napoli\u2019s center back Kalidou Koulibaly.\n\nLiverpool goalkeeper Adri\u00e1n - in his Champions League debut - denied Fabian Ruiz twice in one action before Lozano headed the second rebound into the net only to be whistled offside.\n\nAs dazzling as the offensive display was, the defense was just as impressive.\n\nJo\u00ebl Matip lunged to head away a cross intended for Lozano that seemed a sure goal then Ruiz sprinted back at the other end to intercept what would have been a tap-in for Salah.\n\nThe frantic pace continued, with Firmino heading just wide of the far post from a corner in the 44th.\n\nPossession in the first half was split exactly 50-50.\n\nThe fireworks continued immediately after the break when Adrian hung in the air to deny a volley from Mertens with one hand at the far post.\n\nThere was a rare defensive mistake when Kostas Manolas gifted the ball to Salah in a great position but Napoli goalkeeper Alex Meret extended to glove the Egypt international\u2019s shot wide.\n\nIt was only with 15 minutes to go that the pace slowed, with both teams visibly exhausted on a warm evening.\n\nThen came the decisive penalty.\n\nAdri\u00e1n lunged to his left and got a hand on Mertens\u2018 spot kick but couldn\u2019t stop it.\n\nIn the final minutes, Napoli fans\u2019 whistled so loud every time Liverpool had possession it was deafening, and it seemed to have an effect when Virgil van Dijk gifted the ball to Llorente, who rolled it past Adri\u00e1n with ease.\n\n\u201cWe put in practically the perfect performance,\u201d Callejon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve faced them so many times that we know them tactically by now and did everything right.\u201d\n\nAfter the final whistle, Manolas led the celebrations by dancing in the center circle wearing Salah\u2019s No. 11 shirt.\n\nMeanwhile, Ancelotti - who added another chapter in his long, personal history against Liverpool - consoled Klopp.\n\n\u201cI told him to relax, because if he loses here, he tends to go on and win the Champions League,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cI reassured him.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It didn't take long for VAR to become a talking point as the video refereeing system made its debut in the Champions League group phase.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/02/12/italy_soccer_champions_league_64173_c0-229-5472-3419_s1770x1032.jpg?6f9ce78ee1a3a25672569ab4bf84dc3559d8855e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
