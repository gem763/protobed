Charles Cascarilla, CEO and co-founder of Paxos, stated:\n\n\u201cWe're starting with U.S. listed equities, but this technology can be scaled to many asset classes across geographies and for all types of clients.\"\n\nAt the beginning of September, Paxos launched PAX Gold (PAXG), a gold-backed Ethereum token, claiming that it is \u201cthe first crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold.\u201d A few days later, the stablecoin received a regulatory nod of approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services, with the government body referring to PAXG as the first gold-backed digital currency to become eligible for trading in the state of New York.\n\nKraken adds support for PAX Gold\n\nJust today, the San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken announced that it is listing PAXG. The users of the exchange will be able to deposit, withdraw and trade the asset starting Oct. 29. Kraken will roll out trading pairs between PAXG and Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), as well as with fiat currencies such as the euro and the U.S. dollar.", "description": "Stablecoin operator Paxos is launching its settlement platform for U.S.-listed equity securities after receiving a no-action relief from SEC", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xMDNhMjRlYzhkN2IwMDg5NjdkM2QzNGFiYmE2YTc5YS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
