Notably absent were senior officials from the ruling party that he led for more than four decades, including during the fight for liberation.\n\nJust a handful of people in the gathering of some 200 wore party regalia, a sign of how the bookish, combative former leader died isolated from the people he called comrades for much of his adult life.\n\nMugabe\u2019s family earlier had agreed to a government request to bury him at the National Heroes Acre shrine in the capital Harare, but only after a hilltop mausoleum was built to set him apart from the rest. Then the government on Thursday abruptly announced the family had changed its mind, leaving it with scaffolding around the partially completed memorial.\n\nWhile some might blame his widow for the move, it was Mugabe himself who wanted the private ceremony instead of one presided over by the people who removed him from power, Grace\u2019s sister Junior Shuvai Gumbochuma said in a speech on Saturday.\n\nMugabe's coffin is seen during mass at his rural home in Zvimba, about 100 km from the capital Credit: AP More", "description": "Zimbabwe's former president Robert\u00a0Mugabe\u00a0was buried on Saturday in his rural home village of Kutama in a private farewell for one of Africa\u2019s most divisive figures.
