It\u2019s not quite magic, but it is pretty cool.\n\nFocos has long been one of the most ambitious photo-editing apps on iOS, giving you control over the depth map generated by dual-camera iPhones in portrait mode. You can adjust aperture, simulate different styles of bokeh from various lenses, choose different points of focus, and so on.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a picture of our bunny shot in portrait mode on an iPhone 8 Plus:\n\nAnd here it is in Focos, where you\u2019re able to view the depth map from another angle and actually add a virtual bulb in 3D space to provide directional lighting:\n\nHere it is flipped around to a side-on view where you can adjust the precise depth of field:\n\nYou can even use AR to move your perspective inside the depth map in real time.\n\nAll of this previously relied on access to depth information that Apple has made available to developers since iOS 11, meaning Focos only worked with photos that were taken on dual-camera iPhones: the iPhone 7 Plus, 8 Plus, X, or XS. Now, though, Focos 2.0 has just been released and works with single-lens cameras as well.\n\nFocos 2.0 uses machine learning to calculate depth maps for any picture. Developer Patrick Wang tells The Verge that his AI engine is based on Apple\u2019s CoreML framework and has been trained on a million images. It can run on any iOS device with a 64-bit processor, meaning the A7 (iPhone 5S) and up.\n\nIn my testing, the results are pretty impressive. The AI engine still gets tripped up on the kind of things that often trip up actual dual-camera systems \u2014 fine patterns, overlapping objects, hair, and so on \u2014 but overall it does a good job for regular snapshots.\n\nLike this one, for example:\n\nFocos is able to calculate a depth map that looks like this:\n\nAnd that gives you the ability to tap anywhere in the photo to select your focal point, like this:\n\nThe flaws aren\u2019t hard to see if you look closely, of course. No-one could or should be using this for critical photographic work. But it\u2019s a lot of fun to play with, and a great example of what can be done with computational photography. It also gives dual-camera iPhone users an option for portrait mode with the regular lens. The single-camera iPhone XR does that already when it detects people in the frame, but dual-camera iPhones can only use portrait mode with the telephoto camera, which gives a zoomed-in perspective and is much less effective in low light.\n\nFocos is mostly free, with subscription options that unlock extra lens effects and full-resolution image exports. The app is constantly pushing what\u2019s possible on iOS \u2014 it let you adjust aperture almost a year before Apple delivered a native version of the feature on the iPhone XS, for example. It\u2019s worth keeping around just to check in on the current limits of iOS camera technology.\n\nAs for what\u2019s next, Wang says he\u2019s working on a version of Focos for video that\u2019s due to ship this year.", "description": "Hands-on with Focos 2.0, the latest version of one of the most ambitious iOS photo editors.
