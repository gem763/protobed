The unknown is what makes a person not sleep at night.\n\n'It is hard to understand how someone who has families and children who love and need them live the life they do.\n\n'I have turned it over to God and pray that he decides he is tired of living like this and wants to come home to get help.\n\n'Through social media I have came along so many great people that have crossed his path over time through his past rehab.'\n\nSalfen-Tracy added many families suffer in silence with relatives who are addicted and are too afraid to share their experiences.\n\nJennifer Salfen-Tracy described her son as the 'face of heroin and meth' in her heartbreaking Facebook post\n\nShe wrote: 'I am hesitant on sharing but many people ask how things are going so I feel I should share.\n\n'I have learned along this path that so many people and families deal with the same heartache but just do not talk about it.\n\n'This is a true issue in our world today that we need to pull together and focus on to fix instead of the government worrying about and spending all their money on throwing each other under the bus.'\n\nSince her post went viral, Salfen-Tracy said she has received messages from people in the middle looking for help and advice about their own addition.\n\nShe finished her post with a plea for her son to call her, adding: 'Cody if you see this please call us...we love you!'", "description": "Missouri mother Jennifer Salfen-Tracy posted images of\u00a0her son Cody Bishop taken just seven months apart, showing him initially looking healthy.
