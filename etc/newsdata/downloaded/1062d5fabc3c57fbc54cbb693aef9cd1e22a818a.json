The card streams on ESPN+.\n\nJust days prior to Waterson\u2019s second UFC headliner, rumors began to circulate. Per multiple reports, Jedrzejczyk told the UFC she was struggling with the weight cut. According to ESPN, the UFC had even gone as far as to offer Waterson a few back-up options.\n\nLuckily for Waterson, her Polish opponent dismissed the doubters and indicated the weight cut was on point. Displeased by the fight week drama, Waterson is relieved to hear Jedrzejczyk\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing relief,\u201d Waterson told reporters, including MMA Junkie, at Thursday\u2019s media day. \u201cLike I said, I have faith in Joanna. She\u2019s always been very professional. She\u2019s never missed weight before. Honestly, it\u2019s probably just a moment of weakness that came out to the media.\n\n\u201cThen when the media catches onto something, everybody wants to know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s just something that\u2019s been blown out of proportion, and we can both make weight tomorrow morning and fight.\u201d\n\nIf there is a a problem with Jedrzejczyk\u2019s weight cut, \u201cThe Karate Hottie\u201d will cross that bridge when she comes to it. For now, Waterson is just focusing on what she can control.\n\n\u201cMy focus is for Saturday,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cI signed the contract to fight Joanna for a five-round bout here in Tampa at the max weight of 116 pounds. That\u2019s what I intend to do. All I can really do is focus on what\u2019s inside of my control.\u201d\n\nAs for her own weight cut, everything is on point, according to Waterson. She praised her UFC Tampa fight camp and the team around her responsible for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right on schedule for a very good, healthy weight cut,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cThis camp has been immaculate. All of my coaches and teammates have all just been vibing so well this camp. I\u2019m actually really excited that I get five rounds with Joanna.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just a win that\u2019s up for grabs Saturday, the 33-year-old strawweight believes she has the opportunity to further her legacy and impact \u2013 concepts she has only recently begun thinking about.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that has been kind of coming into this new chapter of my journey within the last year,\u201d Waterson said. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool, actually. I came into the gym as the young buck. I was the one who just got into MMA, who nobody knew who I was. Everybody calls me \u2018Peanut\u2019 at the gym. I was like everybody\u2019s little sister.\n\n\u201cNow we fast forward to 12 years later, and I\u2019m the old one. I\u2019m the old one in the gym trying to crack jokes with the young guys.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201c\u2026 It gives me the chills just thinking that by stepping into the octagon on Saturday and having these interviews, by talking to somebody I don\u2019t know and telling them, \u2018Man, you can do it. Take it one day at a time.\u2019 That\u2019s effecting them for the rest of their lives? It gives me the chills. Martial arts changed my life at a very young age, and if it can just do that for one person, then it will all be worth it.\u201d", "description": "It's been nothing short a hectic fight week for UFC strawweight contender Michelle Waterson.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mike Bohn", "Farah Hannoun", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/michelle-waterson-ufc-tampa-media-day-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
