(Photo: KATRIN)\n\nAn experiment nearly two decades in the making has finally unveiled its measurements of the mass of the universe\u2019s most abundant matter particle: the neutrino.\n\nThe neutrino could be the weirdest subatomic particle; though abundant, it requires some of the most sensitive detectors to observe. Scientists have been working for decades to figure out whether neutrinos have mass and if so, what that mass is.\n\nThe Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment in Germany has now revealed its first result constraining the maximum limit of that mass. The work has implications for our understanding of the entire cosmos, since these particles formed shortly after the Big Bang and helped shape the way structure formed in the early universe.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get a lot of chances to measure a cosmological parameter that shaped the evolution of the universe in the laboratory,\u201d Diana Parno, an assistant research professor at Carnegie Mellon University who works on the experiment, told Gizmodo.\n\nNeutrinos come in three flavours: electron, muon and tau, based on how they interact with the corresponding electron, muon, and tau particles. Back in 1957, physicist Bruno Pontecorvo predicted that neutrinos would oscillate between these three different flavours, but this oscillation would require the particle to have mass. Experiments have since proven that oscillation exists, a finding that netted Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita the 2015 Nobel Prize.\n\nBut figuring their mass out is tricky for various reasons \u2014 most importantly, neutrinos only interact with matter via the weak nuclear force, a difficult fundamental force for human-built experiments to access. Then, there\u2019s the weirdness of quantum mechanics; each neutrino flavour is composed of a probabilistic combination of three \u201cmass states.\u201d Due to the weirdness of quantum mechanics, you can measure either the mass state or the flavour of a neutrino, but not both.\n\nDetecting a particle that doesn\u2019t interact with typical sensors required scientists to get creative. The KATRIN experiment begins with 25 grams of a kind of radioactive hydrogen gas, called tritium, stored in a 9 metre container held at cryogenic temperatures \u2014 cold enough such that even neon gas is a liquid. These atoms undergo a kind of radioactive decay called beta decay, where one of their neutrons turns into a proton, spitting out an electron and an electron-antineutrino in the process (which would have the same mass as the electron neutrino).\n\nThese decay products go into a house-sized detector called a spectrometer that measures the energy of the electrons. The electron and neutrino each carry away some of the energy of the reaction, but how much they take away can vary.\n\nScientists must look at the spectrum of all the different electron energies, focusing particularly on the electrons that have taken away the maximum energy, whose neutrinos would in turn have taken away the minimum energy. Analysis of the shape of the resulting graphs reveals the maximum energy of any of the neutrino mass states.\n\nThe mere fact that oscillation exists sets a lowest possible average mass of the three mass states, less than 0.1 electron volts (eV). After a month of operating and 18 years of planning and construction, KATRIN has now predicted an upper limit of any of the three mass states at 1.1 eV, where an electron weighs around 500,000 eV and a proton weighs nearly a billion.\n\nKATRIN scientists announced the results at the 2019 Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics conference in Toyama, Japan, last Friday.\n\nThe KATRIN collaboration kicked off in 2001, but \u201cit\u2019s been a long time because it\u2019s a really complicated experiment,\u201d Hamish Robertson, a KATRIN scientist and professor emeritus of physics at the University of Washington, told Gizmodo.\n\nThe pressure and temperature of the gas source requires precise control, and there are lots of moving parts. It took years to design and build the enormous spectrometer that rejects unwanted electrons and precisely measures the resulting electrons\u2019 energies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fractal at some level,\u201d said Parno. \u201cIf you zoom in at any part of the experiment and start asking questions, you get the same level of complexity back again.\u201d\n\nKATRIN is just one of several different strategies to calculate the neutrino\u2019s mass. Just last month, researchers used cosmological data to argue that the sum of the three neutrino masses was at most 0.26 electron volts.\n\nOther experiments hope to calculate the neutrino mass using rare atomic decays. But KATRIN\u2019s findings are valuable because they don\u2019t rely on grand theories of how the universe works, noted Duke University associate physics professor Phillip Barbeau, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThis most recent limit on the mass halves the maximum mass determined in other experimental setups and comes from just one month of data. There\u2019s a whole lot more to go, including five years\u2019 worth of data-taking that will further constrain the masses.\n\nScientists ultimately want to know more than just the maximum mass of the states; they want to know the absolute mass of all three states and how they compare to one another. Solving this problem has implications for understanding the early universe\u2019s behaviour, whether the neutrino is its own antiparticle, and why there\u2019s more matter than antimatter in the universe. Lots of physicists are interested in the result.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental parameter,\u201d Kate Scholberg, Duke University professor of physics not involved in the study, told Gizmodo. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to develop overall models of fundamental physics, grand unified theories and that kind of thing, then you want all of the information you can \u2014 like the masses of all of the particles.\u201d", "description": "An experiment nearly two decades in the making has finally unveiled its measurements of the mass of the universe\u2019s most abundant matter particle: the neutrino....", "authors": ["Sam Rutherford", "Ryan F.
