Brady indirectly supported the Jets QB on Monday, admitting he doesn't appreciate his \"private\" sideline conversations making the air when he's mic'd up.\n\nFormer Patriots quarterback Matt Cassel was more direct, writing for NBC Sports Boston that ESPN and the NFL \"embarrassed\" Darnold by airing his vulnerable moment.\n\nDarnold is taking things in stride, though. The 22-year-old said Thursday he will continue to be himself whether he's mic'd up or not and took full responsibility for his horrible play Monday night.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
