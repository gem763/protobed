REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra\n\nThe virus has infected 3,227 people and killed 2,154 of them since the outbreak was declared in August 2018 and went on to became the world\u2019s second worst outbreak, it said.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Emergency Committee on Ebola reviewed the situation since declaring the outbreak an international emergency on July 17. In a statement on Friday, it said the epidemic is \u201ccurrently concentrated in the Mandima health zone in the Biakato mine health area\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis outbreak remains a complex and dangerous outbreak,\u201d WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference, adding that he had accepted the independent panel\u2019s recommendation to maintain the emergency status.\n\n\u201cBut one thing would like to underline, even if this Ebola ends it may come back, because there is instability in eastern DRC and political instability and lack of security. These are pre-conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nFifteen new confirmed cases were reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the week to Oct. 13, the WHO said in its latest update. This compared with nearly 130 cases per week at the peak in April.\n\nBut insecurity and access issues in parts of Mandima, including the Biakato mines, hamper finding infected people and tracing their contacts, as well as ensuring safe burials, it said.\n\nThirty-one of the 50 Ebola cases reported in the last three weeks were from or linked to Biakato, WHO figures show.\n\n\u201cI do believe there will be further cases to be found in the Biakato mines area,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO\u2019s Health Emergencies Programme.\n\n\u201cThe area is that remote and the communities are that deep in the countryside, that it will be another week to two weeks before we can be sure that there is not undetected transmission\n\nin that zone,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Mambasa and most of Mandima, experts have a good handle on the virus\u2019 evolution, Ryan said.\n\n\u201cBut in the areas of Lwemba and Biakato mine we still don\u2019t have a full picture as to where the virus may be.\n\n\u201cSo we don\u2019t believe we are dealing with a catastrophic situation, the numbers are extremely low compared to before, but we don\u2019t fully understand the dynamics of transmission in the Biakoto mine area,\u201d he said.", "description": "Ebola is infecting and killing people in a gold mining area of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and the \"complex and dangerous\" outbreak still constitutes an international emergency, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442628293&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I07Z-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
