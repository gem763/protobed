They mean the world to me at this time and I apologise that I can\u2019t respond individually as I haven\u2019t the words in me right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My darling wife, best friend and soul mate flies free in spirit. I have been the luckiest man in the world to spend time walking, dancing, laughing, praying, dreaming, singing, drumming, talking, travelling, crying, planning, hoping, loving, going wild, exploring, rebelling, forgiving, celebrating, playing, sharing secrets at dawn, opening hearts, minds and soul- alongside a woman of such depth, power, humour, humility, honour, intelligence and love- it is impossible to do justice to with the transient, flimsy power of words.\n\n\u2018Ali is the bravest person I\u2019ve ever met and she faced the last three years of cancer with dignity, grace and light. She shone bright in this world with fire in her heart and water in her soul. The great mystery of existence always visible through her beautiful eyes.\n\n\u2018My heart is truly broken and the pain is intense as I wander aimlessly, waiting to awake from this dream, from hour to hour, day to day. My only prayer is that through the burning down of everything that I hold sacred and precious, through this raw, primal, timeless wound, something else will arise and I am able to embody just a little of Ali\u2019s grace, bravery, tenacity, and lightness, in order to serve her legacy well in the world.\n\n\u2018She inspired and changed the lives of so many, loved ones and strangers alike. Every day I learn of more people who she helped which brings the warmth of pride and gratitude to have known her into my heart. She taught me more than I\u2019m able to comprehend and we shared more than I dreamt was possible in this life. More than either of us thought was possible.\u2019 (sic)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "He has shared an emotional tribute to his late wife.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/jez-hughes-leah-bracknell-698c_1571734785.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
