China's Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are expected to meet on Thursday for the latest high-level talks aimed at resolving the dispute.\n\nHikvision and Dahua join other high-profile Chinese tech firms Huawei and ZTE, which were placed on the Entity List in August. Also added on Monday are artificial intelligence firms SenseTime and Megvii Technology, and iFlytek, a company that specializes in voice recognition.\n\nHikvision said in a statement that it \"strongly opposes today's decision by the U.S. Government,\" claiming that the move \"will hamper efforts by global companies to improve human rights around the world.\"\n\n\"Hikvision, as the security industry's global leader, respects human rights and takes our responsibility to protect people in the U.S. and the world seriously,\" the company said. \"Hikvision has been engaging with Administration officials over the past 12 months to clarify misunderstandings about the company and address their concerns.\"\n\nIn Xinjiang, a vast territory in northwest China home to many minority ethnic groups, the population is subjected to intense surveillance by face recognition technology and other means. Up to 1.5 million Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities are believed to be detained in Xinjiang in massive prison-like education camps.", "description": "The Commerce Department added 28 Chinese security bureaus and tech firms to the Entity List, including Hikvision, a leading producer of video surveillance and face recognition technology.", "authors": ["Scott Neuman"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/08/ap_19142382397843_wide-05279f127306b32d299fba72ec96b9604300158f.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
