He said Tuesday in a letter that State Department officials won\u2019t appear this week as the heads of Congress\u2019s investigation requested. It\u2019s possible some of these people might not speak to Congress at all.\n\nAnd Congress may not have a lot of options left to force potentially key players in its impeachment inquiry to speak to it. The rule book for how to be a check on the executive branch doesn\u2019t include an executive branch unwilling to cooperate.\n\nPompeo is staking his argument on both procedural and political grounds. Procedurally, he accuses Democrats of not providing a technical document, called a Notice of Deposition, to have his staff testify. He says they were not given enough time, and he is demanding that State Department lawyers be present during testimony to assert executive privilege.\n\nDemocrats responded by saying they did everything by the book. \u201cThe committees are operating pursuant to our long-established authorities as well as the impeachment inquiry,\u201d read a statement from the chairmen of three key committees who originally requested State Department staff to talk and who have subpoenaed Pompeo for documents. They added: \u201cSecretary Pompeo was reportedly on the call when the president pressed Ukraine to smear his political opponent. If true, Secretary Pompeo is now a fact witness in the House impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Pompeo listened in on the call between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president that is at the center of the whistleblower allegation that Trump abused his power.\n\nPompeo\u2019s political reasoning for resisting State Department testimony is perhaps more troubling for Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry. He is casting Democrats\u2019 request to talk to the people with potential knowledge of the Ukraine allegations as bullying. That fits neatly with Trump\u2019s assessment that the entire impeachment inquiry is designed to target him. It also fits in Trump\u2019s broader plan to blow off Congress at every opportunity. The U.S. attorney general, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel and now the secretary of state are among the top officials who have refused to talk to Congress, even when subpoenaed.\n\nThis isn't normal, and that's to Congress's detriment.\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz wrote recently, the checks and balances are set up to work if both sides respect the governing norms. The founders just didn\u2019t put tools in the Constitution for this. \u201cAmerica\u2019s democratic system, the world\u2019s oldest, is said to be resilient, with institutions strong enough to defend against runaway actors and with checks and balances designed to prevent too much power from building up in any one place or with any one person,\u201d Balz wrote. \u201cEarlier in Trump\u2019s presidency, that appeared to be the case. Right now, however, that is in question.\u201d\n\nWe know of one tool Congress still has, and it\u2019s pretty blunt: inherent contempt. Some top Democrats have been talking about using this for weeks. It is a long-dormant power for Congress to fine or jail officials who don\u2019t comply. It hasn\u2019t been used in over a century, but when it has, Congress has detained administration officials for not complying with it. Congress doesn\u2019t have its own jail, so lawmakers could try to use the D.C. jail. As you can see, this idea gets pretty extreme pretty quickly.\n\nThe idea of inherent contempt isn\u2019t just on the table for the most liberal Democrats. A group of seven freshman Democrats with military records and/or national security backgrounds wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post last week saying Trump\u2019s actions, if true, are impeachable, and they brought up this idea.\n\n\u201cWe call on our colleagues in Congress to consider the use of all congressional authorities available to us, including the power of \u201cinherent contempt\u201d and impeachment hearings, to address these new allegations, find the truth and protect our national security,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAs I wrote in September, inherent contempt could overshadow the actual impeachment inquiry. It is arguably more drastic than impeachment because of how rare and dramatic it would be. That\u2019s a problem for Democrats in Congress who are worried that impeachment would give Trump a boost in public sentiment or cost some vulnerable Democrats their seats.\n\nAs I also wrote, \u201cthe fact that a centuries-old, somewhat crude enforcement tool is even being considered at the highest levels of Congress in 2019 underscores just how much the Trump administration\u2019s disregard for the democratic process has kneecapped Congress\u2019s ability to do anything to oversee the executive branch. They\u2019re out of options except to create their own jail of sorts.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s safe to say Pompeo knows it.", "description": "The House of Representatives is running out of options to hear from potential key players in the whistleblower allegations.
