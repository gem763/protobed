No specific drugs or brand names were mentioned.\n\nA total of 402 community pharmacy professionals reported what medicines they had struggled to get in the last six months.\n\nHRT drugs were most commonly in short supply, with 84 per cent of respondents having difficulty sourcing the products.\n\nSome 67 per cent of pharmacy staff said they have struggled to get contraceptives, and 58 per cent experienced supply issues of antiepileptic drugs.\n\nMore than half reported a shortage of creams for inflammed skin or blood circulation problems, such as rubefacients, topical NSAIDs, or capsaicin.\n\nMore than 20 per cent reported drugs for diabetes were in short supply.\n\nHRT CRISIS FORCING WOMEN TO SEEK TREATMENT ABROAD Women have been forced into buying HRT medication from abroad as it is now almost impossible to get in Britain. Shortages have been going on for months but reached 'crisis point' this week as most Evorel patches \u2013 the UK market leader \u2013 disappeared from the shelves. Many alternatives were already out of stock and the two main pharmaceutical wholesalers have completely run out of all commonly-prescribed HRT patches, according to an audit seen by the Daily Mail. Manufacturers are rationing what little stock they have with the support of the Department of Health, which has been slammed for its 'disastrous' handling of the crisis. Some women have been buying boxes for their friends from pharmacies while on holiday in Spain. One patient has even been air-freighting HRT from South Africa. Around two-thirds of HRT treatments have been hit by shortages. They include Evorel and Elleste, the two most popular brands, which are prescribed to upwards of 100,000 women a year \u2013 more than half of those on the treatment. More than half of women on HRT are prescribed patches, which are applied once or twice a week below the waist.\n\nAntipsychotic drugs - for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder - and pain relief pills, which may include codeine, also were low in supply.\n\nOne respondent to the survey said the stress of trying to source medicines has caused them to hand in their notice after 35 years as a pharmacist.\n\nAnother said their team is 'barely coping. [We are] on a knife-edge'.\n\nIf pharmacists cannot find a drug to fill out a prescription, they have to send patients back to their GPs to get an alternative.\n\nGPs, who are under increasing work pressure, may be unaware of the shortages and continue to prescribe pills which aren't available.\n\nDr Farah Jameel, of the British Medical Association, said: 'There are lots of different reasons why drug shortages happen, but they are gradually getting worse and can have a serious effect on how quickly patients receive appropriate treatment.\n\n'Practices often won\u2019t know that a drug is in short supply until patients return from the pharmacy, and these extra GP appointments can dramatically add to their already burgeoning workload \u2013 as well as distressing patients.\n\n'GPs already find it difficult to work within their limited budgets, and this is only set to get worse if things carry on as they are.'\n\nThe survey comes amid a 'crisis point' in HRT supply, in which two-thirds of HRT treatments have been hit by shortages.\n\nThey include Evorel and Elleste, the two most popular brands, which are prescribed to upwards of 100,000 women a year.\n\nSome women have been forced into buying HRT medication from abroad to treat their menopause symptoms as it is now almost impossible to get in Britain.\n\nAn inadequate supply of birth control pills has also become apparent in recent months, which doctors said was 'very concerning'.\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said if women are not able to get hold of their contraceptive pill, it could trigger a rise in pregnancies.\n\nLast week, doctors were told to monitor their prescriptions of fluoxetine \u2013 commonly known by its brand name Prozac \u2013 because manufacturing problems have cut supplies.\n\nThe Department of Health wrote to all GPs last week telling them to contact their patients who take the drug to ask how many supplies they have at home.\n\nThe letter stated that any patient with enough pills to last until November should not be issued with a repeat prescription, the magazine Pulse reported.\n\nA separate survey by The Pharmacists' Defence Association (PDA) in August found that pharmacists had seen shortages affect 21 per cent of prescription drugs in the last three months.\n\nMore than 90 per cent of respondents felt the shortages had increased over the last 12 months.\n\nStaff said patients 'asked daily if [shortages] are because of Brexit'.\n\nAlima Batchelor, head of policy at PDA said: 'Whilst these shortages cannot be ascribed to Brexit, they do show the need for concerted action to ensure that leaving the EU will not exacerbate an already unacceptable level of drug shortages.\n\n'These survey results from our members operating across the profession present a stark picture of the huge stresses which drug shortages are causing for both pharmacists and patients.'\n\nAlthough it is not clear why drugs are becoming scarce, with Brexit just 30 days away, it is feared that a No Deal may exacerbate the problem.\n\nThe Government has recommended that suppliers of medicines build up at least six weeks' extra stocks above their usual buffer stock levels in preparation for Brexit.\n\nBut a damning report last week claimed the Department of Health and Social Care's (DHSC) has 'incomplete information' about the levels of stockpiling.\n\nThe National Audit Office reviewed data from DHSC and said: 'The department has done a great deal of work to prepare for a No Deal exit.\n\n'However, there remains a significant amount to do before October 31.\n\n'In the event of a No Deal exit, the department would be working in a highly uncertain environment and operating all the elements of its plan would be a hugely demanding task.'\n\nOf the 12,300 drugs used in the UK, the DHSC estimates that around 7,000 come from, or via, the EU - with the vast majority being shipped across the Channel.\n\nThe Government's own 'reasonable worst case' assumption is that the flow of goods across the Channel could be reduced to 40-60 per cent on day one.\n\nThe Guild of Healthcare Pharmacists (GHP) said that leaving the EU without a deal would bring a 'significant risk' of disruption to the supply of medicines and medical devices.\n\nThe pharmaceutical body said it was 'probably correct' that existing medicines shortages would worsen in the event of a No Deal, The Pharmaceutical Journal reported.\n\nA DHSC spokesperson said: 'We fully understand the concerns of those who require medications in their daily lives and want to reassure them that we are doing everything appropriate so they can access the medicines they need.\n\n'We have no evidence to suggest current or previous supply issues are linked to Brexit.\n\n'The department is working with partners in industry and the health and care system to help ensure the supply of medicines and medical products remains uninterrupted after October 31, whatever the circumstances.'", "description": "The shock survey of 400 pharmacists comes amid a nationwide HRT shortage that has seen British women buy the pills abroad, over claims the supply issues could last until mid-2020.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/10/19146686-0-image-a-3_1569921474623.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
