Number of 401(k) and IRA millionaires hits record high", "language": "en", "text": "There are more millionaires next door.\n\nDespite that fact that most people are undersaved for retirement, a recent study out from Fidelity shows that the retirement savings picture isn\u2019t quite as grim as you might think. Indeed, the number of 401(k) and IRA millionaires hit a record high at the end of the second quarter, Fidelity found.\n\n\u201cThe number of people with $1 million or more in their 401(k) increased to a record 196,000, up from 180,000 at the end of Q1, while the number of IRA millionaires increased to 179,700, also a record high and an increase from 168,100 last quarter,\u201d the report revealed.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, employee savings rates hit a record high, with 32% of savers increasing their contributions in the second quarter of this year. (Interestingly, a recent Bankrate survey had a similar finding: that 29% of Americans had increased their retirement savings contributions from the year prior). Now, the average employee contribution rate is 8.8%, which is nearly a full percentage point higher than a decade ago, Fidelity reports.\n\nBut don\u2019t pull out the confetti yet: Most of us still don\u2019t have enough saved for retirement. Fidelity data show that the average 401(k) balance is still only $106,000, and the average IRA balance is $110,400. And an analysis done by the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that more than four in 10 U.S. households where the head of household is between the ages of 35 and 64 will likely run short of money in retirement.\n\nOne common rule of thumb for how much you need saved for retirement is this: You should have saved 2x your annual salary by 35, 4x at 45, 6x at 55 and 10x by 67. That means that someone who made $75,000 per year would need to have socked away $150,000 by age 35 and $750,000 by age 67. As you can see from a broad look at Fidelity\u2019s numbers, that\u2019s not the reality for many of us.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even those who have socked away $1 million may not have enough to retire on, as Marketwatch reported here. And financial guru Suze Orman thinks you should aim to save $5 million.\n\nIf you\u2019re far from being a 401(k) or IRA millionaire, there may still be time for you to save more. Here are some expert tips on how to do it:\n\nUp your savings motivation, says certified financial planner Bobbi Rebell, host of the Financial Grownup podcast. \u201cThe best way to do that is to simply look at your numbers. Run an online calculator and see where you are relative to your goals. Odds are that will motivate you to take action.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, you should remember that \u201cthe money you contribute to your 401(k) is not taxed,\u201d explains says certified financial planner Mitchell C. Hockenbury of 1440 Financial Partners in Kansas City, Mo. \u201cBut, it would be if it made its way to your paycheck. Therefore, just because you increase your contribution by $100 a month does not mean you have $100 less in your paycheck.\u201d But remember, that money will be taxed upon withdrawal.\n\nMake your savings automatic, advises Hockenbury. \u201cMany 401(k) plans now have a cool feature that automatically raises your contribution to the plan by 1% each year. If you haven\u2019t opted-in to this when you set up your plan, it is a great idea to do so today,\u201d he says.\n\nIncrease your savings rate \u2014 even if you can only do it by a small amount. \u201cIncreasing your contribution rate, even by 1%, can make a big difference in your long-term retirement savings \u2013 what may seem like a small amount today can have a significant impact on your account balance in 10 or 20 years,\u201d said Kevin Barry, president of Workplace Investing at Fidelity Investments, in a statement.\n\nUse your raise towards retirement, says Hockenbury. \u201cYou know ahead of time you are going to receive a raise, before you get your next paycheck, go into the plan and increase your contribution amount,\u201d he says.\n\nLook for where you can free up extra money that you then sock away for retirement. \u201cThe big option right now could be taking a look at your mortgage, and seeing if the math works to refinance, and lower your monthly payments,\u201d says Rebell. \u201cThe extra cash could then be put towards retirement savings.\u201d Adds Hockenbury: \u201cThere are an awful lot of monthly memberships people sign up for and don\u2019t use. Can you eliminate one or two and use the money to put towards an IRA, Roth IRA, or 401(k)?\u201d", "description": "Plus, expert advice on how you can hit the $1 million mark too", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP860_millio_ZG_20190821105407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
