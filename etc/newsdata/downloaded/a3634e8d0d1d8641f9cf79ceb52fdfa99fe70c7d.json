According to Hasbro, it's the first game \"where women make more than men.\" (Hasbro)\n\nThroughout history, women\u2019s contributions have routinely been overlooked, forgotten or erased by men eager to take credit for their ideas. That\u2019s one of the guiding premises behind Ms. Monopoly, the new version of the classic board game from Hasbro.\n\nFeaturing a bright-eyed, coffee-clutching #Girlboss in a sharp-fitted blazer, the game starts female players off with more money than men, and pays them more for passing go. It also \u201ccelebrates women trailblazers\u201d and \u201cspotlights women who have challenged the status quo,\u201d according to Hasbro. Instead of buying up properties, the company explained in a Tuesday news release, players have the opportunity to purchase \u201cgroundbreaking inventions and innovations made possible by women throughout history.\u201d\n\n[A new Monopoly game celebrates innovative women \u2014 and pays them more than men]\n\nBut to those familiar with Monopoly\u2019s history, it seemed like one trailblazing woman was conspicuously absent.\n\n\u201cIf @Hasbro actually wanted to celebrate women\u2019s empowerment with their new \u2018Ms. Monopoly\u2019 game, why not *finally* acknowledge that a woman invented Monopoly in the first place?\u201d tweeted Mary Pilon, the author of \u201cThe Monopolists: Obsession, Fury, and the Scandal Behind The World\u2019s Favorite Board Game.\u201d\n\nThat would be Lizzie Magie, who introduced the world to a groundbreaking innovation of her own more than a century ago. It was called the Landlord\u2019s Game \u2014 but because the man who claimed the idea for his own and sold it to Parker Brothers changed the name, we know it today as Monopoly. That man, Charles Darrow, would ultimately make a fortune off the board game, while Magie reportedly earned just $500 \u2014 likely less than it cost her to patent the concept in the first place.\n\nThough that history was excavated in an decade-long legal battle and is documented in Pilon\u2019s extensively researched book, Hasbro still maintains that Darrow was the creator of Monopoly. A spokeswoman told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday that Magie, a vocal feminist who defied the odds by getting a patent for her invention, was \u201cone of the pioneers of land-grabbing games,\u201d a number of which have been popular throughout history.\n\n\u201cMy gut reaction,\u201d wrote one Twitter commentator on Tuesday, \u201cis this is a slap in the face of Elizabeth Magie.\u201d\n\nIf you can suddenly hear a noise, it's Lizzie Magie rolling in her grave https://t.co/0XaJaIWECI \u2014 non-organic and pure gmo (@goddessofcheese) September 10, 2019\n\nWhile today\u2019s Monopoly is an unbridled celebration of capitalism, Magie designed the game as a rebuke to that worldview. She was a disciple of the 19th-century economist Henry George, who believed that railroads, telegraphs and utilities should be publicly owned, rather than controlled by monopolies, and that land should be considered common property. Though he didn\u2019t align himself with the socialists who supported his failed campaign for mayor of New York, George considered it unjust that those fortunate enough to own property grew rich off their holdings, while the working class was condemned to spend most of their wages on rent.\n\nMagie, who worked as a stenographer, typist and actress in Washington, D.C., had the idea of spreading George\u2019s critique of economic inequality through a family-friendly board game. In 1904, she received a patent for a square board that bears a strong resemblance to today\u2019s Monopoly set, with nine spaces on each side. Winning players bought up railroads, utilities and properties, enriching themselves by collecting cash from the losers, who fell further and further behind. Land on the wrong corner, and you would go directly to jail.\n\n[The Monopoly shame: Leftist D.C. inventor didn't even get token recognition]\n\n\u201cIn a short time, I hope a very short time, men and women will discover that they are poor because Carnegie and Rockefeller, maybe, have more than they know what to do with,\u201d Magie told a reporter two years after the game was patented.\n\nAs Pilon wrote in her 2015 book, the Landlord\u2019s Game was designed with two separate sets of rules: monopolist and anti-monopolist. When players became overwhelmed by the amount of cash they were forking over to their oligarch opponents, they could vote to switch to the anti-monopolist rules, which mirrored George\u2019s precepts. Even children as young as 9 or 10 could learn from the game, Magie noted in a 1902 article in the Single Tax Review.\n\n\u201cThey learn that the quickest way to accumulate wealth and gain power is to get all the land they can in the best localities and hold on to it,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cLet the children once see clearly the gross injustice of our present land system and when they grow up, if they are allowed to develop naturally, the evil will soon be remedied.\u201d\n\nFUN FACT: Monopoly was based on The Landlord's Game, created in 1902 by Lizzie Magie to demonstrate the rampant inequality caused by capitalist greed. The idea was taken by a man and sold to Parker Brothers, who adapted it as the polar opposite of what Magie had intended. https://t.co/yBAry0BK6p \u2014 andi zeisler (@andizeisler) September 10, 2019\n\nHer invention developed a cult following in left-wing circles, with homemade variations cropping up in places like Atlantic City, where Quakers modified the game to feature the names of local landmarks like Boardwalk and Park Place. It was that version that Charles Darrow, an out-of-work heating engineer, stumbled across in 1932, when friends invited him and his wife over to play. As \u201cThe Monopolists\u201d details, Darrow developed a fascination with the game, asking his hosts to write down all the rules, and peppering them with complicated questions.\n\nBut when Darrow sold the board game to Parker Brothers three years later, he claimed to have come up with the idea all by himself. \u201cBeing unemployed at the time, and badly needing anything to occupy my time, I made by hand a very crude game for the sole purpose of amusing myself,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the gamemakers.\n\nIt was an appealing story, particularly in the depths of the Great Depression: A down-and-out worker, through his own ingenuity, had invented a game that sold more than 2 million copies in its first two years, and had grown rich off the royalties. Parker Brothers credited the game\u2019s popularity with saving their family company from going under, and Darrow\u2019s story was enshrined in corporate legend.\n\ncool are they finally acknowledging Elizabeth Magie as the real creator of the game or naaaaaah https://t.co/g9BlTWpSz0 \u2014 Jessi Sheron makes mermaid comics (@JessiSheron) September 10, 2019\n\nIn 1935, the same year that Parker Brothers bought the game from Darrow, the company offered Magie a flat sum of $500 for the Landlord\u2019s Game and two other games she had invented, so that they would own the full legal rights to Monopoly and any spinoffs. The activist accepted, hoping it meant her radical, left-wing message would receive a broader audience. She never made any royalties off what she described as \u201cmy beloved brainchild,\u201d and when she died in relative obscurity in 1948, no mention of the game appeared in her obituary.\n\nThe political messaging behind the game vanished, too. In interviews that appeared in the Washington Evening Star and The Washington Post in 1936, Magie lamented that the millions of Americans who were playing Monopoly weren\u2019t learning about single tax theory, the economic principle that the Landlord\u2019s Game had been designed to promote. After she died, the game\u2019s anti-capitalist history was largely forgotten. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s, when an economics professor who had developed his own game called Anti-Monopoly entered into a fierce, decade-long legal battle with Parker Brothers, that the game\u2019s true origin story inadvertently came to light.\n\nBut perhaps the strongest illustration of how far Monopoly has strayed from Magie\u2019s vision came this August, when Hasbro, which has owned the game since 1991, introduced Monopoly: Socialism. Rather than promoting left-wing ideals, the game \u201cpacks a message tailored for capitalists,\u201d as CNN put it, lampooning both the idea of a living wage and health foods like vegan meatloaf. Some critics were unimpressed: A Polygon reviewer deemed the game \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and wrote that it \u201cforgoes any pretense of being fun to play.\u201d\n\nMs. Monopoly, by contrast, promotes a capitalist worldview as a framework for empowering women. \u201cFrom inventions like WiFi to chocolate chip cookies, solar heating and modern shapewear, Ms. Monopoly celebrates everything from scientific advancements to everyday accessories \u2014 all created by women,\u201d a Tuesday statement from Hasbro said.\n\nNotably missing was an invention that has reached even more people than solar heating or shapewear \u2014 the world\u2019s best-selling proprietary board game.", "description": "Lizzie Magie, who patented the property-collecting board game decades before a man claimed to have dreamed it up, saw her creation as a critique of capitalism and economic inequality.", "authors": ["Antonia Noori Farzan", "Reporter For The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Antonia Noori Farzan Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
