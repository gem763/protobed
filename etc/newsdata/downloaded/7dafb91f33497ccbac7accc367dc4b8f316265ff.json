That fact played out Thursday night in Houston as one Texas State Representative delivered his displeasure with Robert Francis O\u2019Rourke\u2019s idea that his weapon should be taken away from him.\n\nWhen the subject of gun control came up at the Democrat debate, when asked if he is in favor of gun confiscation, O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d He describes these weapons as \u201cweapons of war\u201d, a popular gun-grabbing talking point. The incorporation of the word \u2018war\u2019 is for dramatic effect.\n\n\u201cCritics call this confiscation. Are you proposing taking away their guns, and how would this work?\u201d asked debate moderator David Muir. O\u2019Rourke said assault weapons were designed for a battlefield, not for hunting or personal protection. \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow it to be used against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke elaborated that folks in red states agree with him. Texas State Rep. Briscoe Cain joined the debate on Twitter. His message \u2013 \u201cMy AR is ready for you, Robert Francis.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re a child Robert Francis https://t.co/rU3WoYQFQV \u2014 \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27 (@BriscoeCain) September 13, 2019\n\nIn other words, Cain is saying, Come and take it. The Twitterverse reacted as you\u2019d expect \u2013 Cain was accused of threatening a presidential candidate and many on Twitter tagged the FBI in their tweets. Robert Francis called it a threat and tweeted Cain shouldn\u2019t own an AR-15 and \u201cneither should anyone else.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke is clinging to the gun confiscation position because he has little else to run on at this point. He has nothing to lose by going over the cliff in a radical policy kind of gesture because he is floundering at the bottom of the heap after once being touted as the great savior of his party. This morning, as I write this, O\u2019Rourke is at 2.8% in the combined averages of polling at Real Clear Politics \u2013 behind Andrew Yang. He used the mass shooting at the Walmart in El Paso as an opportunity to reinvigorate his presidential campaign before he eventually has to drop out and settle for running for U.S. Senate against John Cornyn. The other candidates on the stage Thursday night, by the way, complimented O\u2019Rourke for his bold stance.\n\nO\u2019Rourke exposed the truth about the radical left and guns. Kamala Harris wants Congress to act on guns in her first 100 days or else she pledges to go it alone and take executive action. Elizabeth Warren said the gun-grabbing will have to be done incrementally. At least she\u2019s now honest enough to admit that they won\u2019t be satisfied with only partial confiscation. Democrats will just keep going with it.\n\nCain\u2019s tweet was taken down by Twitter. It was labeled as a violation of Twitter\u2019s terms of service against violent threats.\n\nMinutes ago, @twitter took down this @briscoecain tweet about @BetoORourke. A @Twitter spokesperson said \u201cit violates our rules for threats of violence.\u201d pic.twitter.com/N9APEGjNzY \u2014 Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) September 13, 2019\n\nAn O\u2019Rourke spokesperson confirmed that the campaign reported Cain\u2019s tweet to the FBI. Some supporters voiced surprise that Twitter didn\u2019t suspend his account.\n\nAn O'Rourke campaign spokesperson declined offer any comment on Twitter\u2019s decision to take down Cain\u2019s original tweet. No comment on whether this response was appropriate or did not go far enough. Only comment: that the campaign did report Cain's tweet to the @FBI. \u2014 Lois Beckett (@loisbeckett) September 13, 2019\n\nFull disclosure: I am acquainted with Rep. Cain. He is a young, conservative Republican lawmaker from the Houston area, elected in 2016. The 34-year-old lawyer is showing a penchant for provocative actions in the political arena. He blames Asperger syndrome for some of his actions.\n\nLast year, Cain was thrown out of the state Democratic convention after trying to distribute prank gun control signs, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported at the time. One attendee accused him of brandishing a gun at the event. According to the Dallas Morning News, Cain told his fellow lawmakers earlier this year that he has Asperger syndrome and said: \u201cSometimes the things I say or do may come off completely different from what I intended.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Rourke is raising money over his stance on gun confiscation. This is my shocked face.", "description": "\"You're a child, Robert Francis.\"", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beto.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
