This has been particularly evident in the corporate clients business,\" Commerzbank said, explaining the downgrade in its revenue expectations.\n\nThe supervisory board also approved plans to sell a stake in the bank's Polish subsidiary mBank and absorb its Comdirect online brokerage unit.\n\nThe lender flagged the strategic overhaul last week.\n\nThe measures were approved by the board during a two-day meeting.\n\nAmong the plans, the bank will cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in \"strategic areas\", so the group headcount will fall in total by about 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce. It now employs about 40,700 people.\n\nCommerzbank said the strategy would involve investment of 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion), with 750 million euros going into new technology and the rest earmarked for restructuring.\n\nGermany's banks have been battling a legacy of bad debts, bloated workforces and fines a decade after the global financial crash. Commerzbank had already been reducing staff and is trying to cut back-office work to restore profitability.\n\nIts restructuring plan is negative for the German lender's credit rating, ratings agency Moody's has said.\n\nThe agency said plans to sell mBank would \"further limit the bank's growth potential given that mBank meaningfully contributed to the group's revenue and profits, and its growth\".", "description": "Commerzbank no longer expects a rise in underlying revenue this year, the German lender warned on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105377768-1533557925259gettyimages-914831160.jpg?v=1533557953", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
