The matter is now being dealt with by the National Prosecuting Authority and the investigative officer, who will ascertain whether this does not amount to her violation of her bail conditions,\u201d said Mulaudzi.\n\nThe Hawks and the Asset Forfeiture Unit were seizing assets from Gumede and her co-accused in relation to the multimillion-rand fraud and corruption case.\n\nMulaudzi said there were 10 houses that they were targeting on Thursday.\n\nCity Press understands that more than R51 million in assets were seized, as well as a range of luxury vehicles including a Porsche, Jaguar and Lamborghini.\n\nGumede last appeared in court with eThekwini senior councillor Mondli Mthembu and nine other co-accused in August and the matter was postponed to January 15.\n\nThe controversial former eThekwini leader was then officially ousted as mayor in September following an announcement by ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte confirming that Gumede and other senior party members had been removed from the powerful, decision-making executive committee. However, they remained ordinary councillors.", "description": "Embattled former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede may have her bail revoked after possibly violating her bail conditions.", "authors": ["Juniour Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9121/9e1ab6af3e024870b621c001dca47b17.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
