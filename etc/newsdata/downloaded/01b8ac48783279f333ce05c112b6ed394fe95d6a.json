It's like when the averages would go higher every time oil would go higher.\n\nThere is no real connection to the economy right now because another aspect of globalization, besides the way that the U.S. and other countries catered to China all of these years in a craven way to get more business, is that money can flow freely from one area to another.\n\nEvery time yields go up you should expect that buyers will come and force those yields down.\n\nThe reason why this game is so stupid is that the algos are set to short stocks all the way down which means, if you believe as I do, that we could easily have negative rates from the amount of money coming in, then stocks should go down relentlessly. I just don't think that's going to happen. But I respect the algos and I think you have to accept their downward bias as interest rates keep dropping.\n\nThe one difference between us and pretty much every country is that these rates are attractive to business people who want to build things where there is demand.\n\nAnd if the president were to realize that, how terrific it would be to offer long bonds?\n\nThen we could have a backstop if the economy tips into recession, not a bad option if the yield curve really is telling something negative which, again, I do not think is the case.", "description": "Jim Cramer says the inverted yield curve game in the market is stupid.", "authors": ["Jim Cramer", "Playing This Silly Inversion Game Makes Me Sick", "There Is No Real Connection To The Economy Right Now Because Of Globalization.", "Bob Ciura", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Collins", "Bruce Kamich", "Paul Price", "Kevin Curran"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/4fb1af0e-5f7f-11e8-a773-152a441e2789.png"}
