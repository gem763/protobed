Which is to say he knows a lot about cooking, but really relishes the feasting part of a meal. That\u2019s at least partly why Houseman is one of a handful of neighborhood places in New York that have, thanks to word of mouth, turned into quiet destinations.\n\nThere are regulars who live in the neighborhood, and regulars who, as one diner put it, \u201cwish they lived in the neighborhood so they could be a real regular.\u201d They come for a menu composed of what Mr. Baldwin calls \u201cevery day\u201d American food: roasted chicken, burgers, grilled meats, and lots of local produce and fish.\n\nMr. Baldwin, a third generation fisherman, has a knack for cooking with what\u2019s available. Often, that\u2019s by-catch, or fish that is usually thrown back. Before he worked in restaurants, he made abstract sculptures using supplies from hardware stores, and techniques like upholstery and lamination.\n\nIf you could travel anywhere in the world to eat or to learn more about the food culture, where would you go? And why.\n\nToyama, Japan, to visit my friend, a chef named Sotohiro Kosugi, who has a restaurant there. But also Wuhan, China; Taiwan; Singapore; Norway. A lot of people told me Norwegian food was bad, but I went recently and it was crazy good. The key is meeting and talking to people, and then eating like they do.\n\nWhat or who is inspiring you now \u2014 an ingredient, a trend, a place, a person?\n\nI\u2019m a fisherman year round. I fish on Long Island, and the landscape is spectacular. I think about what the fish are eating, how to cook them, how to catch them, what I want to eat them with. Fish doesn\u2019t travel well, so local fish makes the most sense to me. Context is critical in cooking, and fish give you so much context, so much to work with.\n\nWhat ingredient have you discovered or rediscovered recently, and how are you using it?\n\nI come back to local fish a lot. I caught a lot of bluefish this spring and have been thinking of making a sort of Long Island fish stew with it, inspired by bouillabaisse. I like making a rich broth with bony bodies and using some seaweed that comes in with the catch, and Japanese ogo, which is sort of like sea fris\u00e9e.\n\nDo you have a favorite cookbook, and if so, what is it and why?\n\nI can\u2019t answer in the singular. First, the Nero Wolfe Cookbook, which is this real cookbook based on the dishes created by the chef Fritz in Rex Stout\u2019s series of detective novels, published from the 1930s to 1970s. The way he describes food was thrilling to me. Then, I love reading old Escoffier. Richard Olney\u2019s books don\u2019t disappoint. And I love how Alice Waters shared the stage with her chefs in all of the Chez Panisse books.", "description": "We interviewed the chefs and owners of more than two dozen of the city\u2019s best restaurants who are participating in The New York Times Food Festival.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/autossell/29sp-cover/29sp-cover-facebookJumbo-v2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
