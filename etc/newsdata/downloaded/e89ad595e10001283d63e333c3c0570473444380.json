The indictment alleges the Chrisleys submitted fake bank and financial statements to financial institutions to get loans. It also claims the couple sent fabricated financial documents to a California property owner to rent a home there, and that they used a company they\u2019d created called 7C\u2019s Productions to hide their television show earnings from the IRS and failed to file and pay taxes on time, the indictment says.\n\nFederal prosecutors say the criminal charges stem from when the couple lived in Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs before moving to Tennessee a few years ago.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nGeorgia Department of Revenue spokesman William Gaston told The Associated Press the department was not allowed to comment on confidential taxpayer information.\n\n\u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d follows the tight-knit, boisterous family living in Nashville.
