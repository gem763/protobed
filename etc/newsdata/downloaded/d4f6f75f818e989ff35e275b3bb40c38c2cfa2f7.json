All four facilities had provided their coordinates to the United Nations for inclusion on a list to avoid strikes.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres announced last month that he was setting up an internal investigation into the bombing of hospitals in Syria that had previously flagged their coordinates.\n\nSeveral dozen medical facilities with links to the UN have been damaged or destroyed by bombs this year.
