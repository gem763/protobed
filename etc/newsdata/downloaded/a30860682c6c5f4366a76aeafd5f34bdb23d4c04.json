This weekend, \u201cthe president and his allies all journeyed to the mountains of madness, where all meaning was devoured in the cavernous maw of stupid, and they all got on the crazy train for one reason: to try to confuse everyone about a very simple story\u201d, joked Colbert.\n\nThat story is called Don and the Giant Impeach, and it goes like this: \u201cOnce upon a time, Donald Trump called the president of Ukraine and asked the foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden. The end.\u201d\n\nIt should also be the end \u201cof his presidency, you would think\u201d, Colbert said, especially after an abridged transcript, released by the White House, of a phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seemed to confirm allegations from a whistleblower in the intelligence community.\n\n'Wild west of the drug industry': John Oliver takes on compounding pharmacies Read more\n\nOver the weekend, Trump went after the whistleblower, whose identity remains legally protected. \u201cYou know the phrase: hey, don\u2019t kill the messenger?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t know that phrase.\u201d\n\nTrump tweeted, for instance, that he deserved to meet his accuser. Colbert issued a slight correction: \u201cYou only have the right to meet your accuser in a court of law. And I certainly hope you get that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSeth Meyers\n\n\u201cReality is catching up with Trump as Democrats move forward with their impeachment inquiry and support for impeachment rises in the polls,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. \u201cAnd in response to all that, Trump is predictably losing his mind.\u201d\n\nMeyers recapped a weekend of paranoid Trump tweets, including the president\u2019s threats to punish the whistleblower who reported the Ukraine call and alleged cover-up to Congress.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric was \u201cdangerous\u201d, said Meyers. \u201cThe president is threatening arrest and imprisonment for people who dare to investigate his abuses of power. The only thing stopping our system from collapsing is that everyone just ignores him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all gotten to the point where we just have to treat the president of the United States like a guy taking a shit in the subway car,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cAt some point, everyone\u2019s just gonna move to the other end of the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump loyalists made the rounds on cable talkshows, especially Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who is directly named in the whistleblower complaint. Meyers showed a clip from ABC\u2019s This Week in which Giuliani, asked if he would acquiesce to congressional subpoenas, answered: \u201cThat is a question with a lot, a lot of implications. Believe it or not, I\u2019m an attorney.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel on Trump's whistleblower: 'If this isn't it, nothing will be' Read more\n\n\u201cI do not believe it,\u201d Meyers answered. \u201cI think you are a bunch of body parts sewn together and brought to life in a laboratory, and maybe, just maybe, some of the body parts were from attorneys.\u201d\n\nLater on Fox News, Giuliani showed text messages discussing the Trump-Zelenskiy call from the state department official Kurt Volker and said: \u201cThe whistleblower falsely alleges that I was operating on my own. Well, I wasn\u2019t operating on my own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that Rudy is trying to smear the whistleblower by pointing out the crimes they didn\u2019t report,\u201d said Meyers.\n\nTrevor Noah\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) What started as a scandal involving a call to Ukraine is now snowballing bigly. pic.twitter.com/uDmuse0Sz2\n\nOn the Daily Show, Trevor Noah turned to another arm of the impeachment investigation: a report from the New York Times, later confirmed by NBC News, that Trump pressured the Australian prime minister to help him discredit the Mueller report. The report is bad for \u201ctwo reasons\u201d, said Noah. \u201cOne, because it would mean Trump has been using the presidency as his personal vendetta machine. And two, it also means he\u2019s been using world leaders as his personal errand boys.\u201d\n\nThe Australia story demonstrates, Noah said, \u201cthat what started as a scandal about a call to Ukraine is now snowballing bigly\u201d. Democrats are moving to impeach, and polls are showing more Americans in favor of \u201cproceedings to impeach his ass\u201d. But luckily for Trump, \u201cthere\u2019s a group of supporters that will never leave his side, and those are Republican lawmakers\u201d.\n\nNoah recapped a laundry list of Trump loyalists deployed to defend the president by going after the whistleblower or, in the case of the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, falsely accusing a news anchor of adding \u201cthough\u201d to \u201cI want you to do us a favor, though,\u201d from the Ukrainian call notes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise most Republican lawmakers are standing with President Trump,\u201d Noah surmised. \u201cBut what is a little surprising is that they\u2019re arguing that not only did Trump not do anything wrong, but the real bad guy here is the one who reported the crime in the first place.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts battle a barrage of paranoid Trump tweets and Republican defenses as the impeachment investigation snowballs", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/321941ca9f6ccbd5a294b35526a54d234b4f857e/74_0_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74a7f75ce9c4ac0d7563ef505e83789d", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
