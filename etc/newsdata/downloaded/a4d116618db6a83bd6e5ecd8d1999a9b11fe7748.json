The pact is tentative and subject to change as President Donald Trump was due to meet Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Washington this afternoon, just after grains markets close on the Chicago Board of Trade.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectations we get a deal,\u201d Jack Scoville, vice president at Chicago brokerage Price Futures Group Inc., said by telephone.\n\nChina already had discussed boosting purchases of U.S. agriculture products such as soybeans, pork and wheat. The world\u2019s top soy importer had already been buying both the oilseed and pork in the U.S. as recently as the week ending Oct. 3, U.S. government data showed. Hog, cotton and ethanol futures also gained in Chicago.\n\n\u201cThe key will be whether these are true concessions \u2013 enforceable elimination of trade barriers and tariffs on U.S. farm products, including soybeans, corn, DDGS, wheat and ethanol, to name a few \u2013 or whether it\u2019s just China\u2019s commitment to step up purchases,\u201d said Bryce Knorr, a senior grain market analyst at Farm Futures.\n\nThe meeting and potential risks surrounding wintry weather in the northern U.S. and in southern Canada that could curb supplies of some crops prompted some grain traders to close out bets.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a huge risk-off event ahead of the weekend,\u201d said Joe Nussmeier, a broker at Frontier Futures in Minneapolis.\n\nSome traders remained skeptical buying soybeans from the U.S. represented a significant breakthrough in the overall trade talks, according to people familiar with the matter. China has been buying soybeans in Brazil in the past two days after some goodwill purchases from the U.S. and the strategy of switching between the two countries has helped China secure lower prices, the people said.\n\n\u201cChina needs soybeans right now because Brazil\u2019s supplies are exhausted,\u201d Knorr said. \u201cBut even if they wind up taking 30 million metric tons as reported, total U.S. exports likely would still be\u201d lower than before the trade war began, he said.\n\nGoodwill purchases of soybeans have been taking place since December and a full deal still hasn\u2019t been reached.\n\n\u201cI am a bit pessimistic this could be the real deal as we have stumbled on the finish line a few times,\u201d said Niko Anderson, a grain broker at SCB Group in Chicago. \u201cWhile recent export sales out of the Pacific Northwest seem very encouraging, we have seen China buy before without any deal actually being reached.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Michael Hirtzer in Chicago at mhirtzer@bloomberg.net;Isis Almeida in Chicago at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Attwood at jattwood3@bloomberg.net, Millie Munshi\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Soybean futures jumped to the highest in more than three months, while corn extended gains, on news that the U.S. and China reached a partial agreement in the trade war that could lay the groundwork for a broader deal.China would agree to some agriculture concessions as part of the deal", "authors": ["Michael Hirtzer", "Isis Almeida"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CSQIa.jvjz.qMZqbDpYsJg--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e0c8dfb7aea1cff0f805b1d6bf8f15f0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
