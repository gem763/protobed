However, days with less than five tweets have seen positive returns, with a 5 basis point boost, which is a \u201cstatistically significant\u201d number.\n\nWhen the president tweets, he frequently shares economic policy proposals -- like his suggestion last week that he\u2019s, once again, flirting with the idea of indexing capital gains to inflation -- but also criticizes both the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nOn Tuesday, while tweeting, Trump had already lambasted the Fed for not aggressively lowering interest rates, warned China about delaying trade talks and seemingly threatened to heighten the trade stand-off with the European Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStocks were sharply lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping almost 1 percent when it opened amid the renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nU.S. economic policy uncertainty is contributing to a three-year high in stock-market volatility as well, the research concluded.
