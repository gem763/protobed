And she\u2019s furious the WNBA didn\u2019t support her this year when she took two months off in the spring for post-partum depression, Diggins-Smith expressed in a series of tweets.\n\nDiggins-Smith, 29, said she played while pregnant throughout the entire five-month 2018 season and \u201cdidn\u2019t tell a soul.\u201d She was still a leading player in the league and averaged 17.9 points and 6.2 assists. She also earned a fourth All-Star slot.\n\nBut Diggins-Smith said when she took two months early this season with a newborn son and post-partum depression, she was slammed as a \u201cquitter\u201d who was giving up on her team.\n\nI played the ENTIRE season pregnant last year! All star, and led league (top 3-5) in MPG....didn\u2019t tell a soul. \u2014 Skylar Diggins-Smith (@SkyDigg4) October 19, 2019\n\nPeople called me a quitter, said I gave up on my team, etc., etc.\n\n\n\nNot knowing I took two FULL months away from everything because of postpartum depression. With limited resources to help me be successful mentally/physically.\n\n\n\nBut just wait though....KEEP THAT SAME ENERGY. \u2014 Skylar Diggins-Smith (@SkyDigg4) October 19, 2019\n\nThe blasts that disrespect of mothers (and our rights) in the WNBA is incredible. I can\u2019t wait until you hear my story FROM ME! \u2014 Skylar Diggins-Smith (@SkyDigg4) October 19, 2019\n\nHaving no support from your own organization is unfortunate \u2014 Skylar Diggins-Smith (@SkyDigg4) October 18, 2019\n\nDiggins-Smith first publicly revealed she was pregnant with her first child last October, almost two months after the Wings ended its 2018 season with a loss against Phoenix in August.\n\nDiggins-Smith practiced with the Wings before the 2019 season started in May and expected to play but never did.\n\nTeam president and general manager Greg Bibb told the Dallas Morning News during the season that it was \u201c100% up to Skylar\u201d when she played. \u201cWe\u2019re going to support her and her timeline and when she says she\u2019s ready to go, we\u2019re going to welcome her back,\u201d he told the newspaper. She \u201cneeds to focus on getting herself healthy and getting her family situated and feeling good about all of that,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the talented guard, who\u2019s a free agent, will return to the team next season.\n\nUnder the WNBA collective bargaining agreement, players who become pregnant under contract are to receive half their salary, and their medical expenses are to be covered by insurance, according to Yahoo Sports.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear what Diggins-Smith received. But she tweeted that she had \u201climited resources to help me be successful mentally/physically.\u201d At the same time she was expected to \u201ckeep that same energy\u201d on the basketball court, she added.\n\nNeither the WNBA or the Dallas Wings could immediately be reached for comment about Diggins-Smith\u2019s complaints.", "description": "And she's not happy about what she considers a lack of WNBA support when she took two months off for post-partum depression this season.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daba9612100002d1a34a76e.jpeg?cache=pjqvlyh0g3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
