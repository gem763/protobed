We are here to lead by example.\u201d\n\nFortescue is pushing hard to cut fossil fuel use after unveiling a deal with Alinta Energy to use a solar-gas hybrid system supported by batteries to power its Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak mines.\n\nThe company is also exploring the use of hydrogen as a power source not just in mining but for China's steel makers, although it concedes any breakthrough on that front is probably at least a decade away.\n\nMr Forrest also bristled when questioned about the company\u2019s bitter legal dispute with traditional owners of land in the Pilbara where Fortescue has built its Solomon mining hub without a native title agreement.\n\nHe told a shareholder who urged Fortescue to settle a dispute with members of a community based around Roebourne in WA that he should \u201cstart employing people and make a real difference\u201d.\n\nMr Forrest gave the strongest indication to date that Fortescue would seek to take the dispute to the High Court after losing a Federal Court appeal over a decision to grant the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation exclusive possession status under native title.\n\nHe said Roebourne was a community suffering from alcohol and drug abuse, \"wanton misbehaviour\" and that \"kids don't go to school\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That is not a community I'm to empower with tens of million of dollars of your cash,\" he told shareholders.\n\nMr Forrest also made it clear Fortescue would not make changes to non-financial targets in its bonus system despite coming close to a first strike on the remuneration report.\n\nHe said non-financial parameters were important to avoid some of the greed exposed by Kenneth Hayne in his royal commission into the banking sector.", "description": "The Fortescue chairman says the iron ore miner will control what it can control and not chase media \"sugar hits\" with claims about reducing scope 3 emissions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3653%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_270%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d3b6e86fea47eb323c0b1c4d9ba7341dbc0f156a", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
