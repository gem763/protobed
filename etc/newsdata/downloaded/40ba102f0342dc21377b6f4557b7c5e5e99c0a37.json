The Kurdish forces, which have been fighting for an independent homeland for Kurds, could be in serious jeopardy when Turkish troops sweep into the area.\n\nErdogan has expressed displeasure with the support the United States has given those Kurdish forces.\n\nThe White House used its statement to ding its European allies.\n\n\u201cThe United States Government has pressed France, Germany, and other European nations, from which many captured ISIS fighters came, to take them back, but they did not want them and refused. The United States will not hold them for what could be many years and great cost to the United States taxpayer,\u201d it said. \u201cTurkey will now be responsible for all ISIS fighters in the area captured over the past two years.\u201d\n\nTrump and Erdogan are to meet in Washington at some point in the coming weeks.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/25/a4/9c825df046aaa92cec969cd5df4a/webp.net-resizeimage%20(1).jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
