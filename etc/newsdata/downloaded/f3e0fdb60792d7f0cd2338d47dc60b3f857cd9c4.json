Neither firm has admitted any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile the settlement may not be as much as the company was after, Watchstone\u2019s investors seem relieved the matter has been put to rest, as the shares shot up 55 per cent to 166p during the week.\n\nThe AIM All-Share was 1.3 per cent higher at 892 in the week, while the FTSE 100 was up 2.2 per cent at 7,306.\n\nOn the high street, retailer Shoe Zone found itself on firmer footing after reporting that trading had got no worse following a profit warning in August.\n\nThe company, which sells 18million pairs of shoes each year, saw revenues rise by 1 per cent to \u00a3161.9million in the 53 weeks to 5 October. The stabilised performance was enough to push the shares up 16 per cent to 131p over the week.\n\nFirestone Diamonds sparkled after a trading update said a power outage that had affected operations at its Liqhobong mine in Lesotho was expected to be resolved by early November. The stock surged 29 per cent to 0.7p in response.\n\nTelecoms manufacturer Filtronic received a good reception from investors, rising 11 per cent to 9p, after reporting that demand was looking up after a \u2018challenging year\u2019.\n\nDespite profits in its latest full-year being almost completely wiped out, falling to \u00a3100,000 from \u00a32.7million, the company predicted \u2018significant organic growth\u2019 in the coming year.\n\nPersonnel and talent management specialist Mind Gym also flexed 9 per cent higher to 134p as the firm said full-year revenues would be slightly ahead of expectations after increasing the proportion of incomes derived from its 25 biggest accounts.\n\nIn the fallers, gold miner Panthera Resources was mauled after another delay to its legal case before the Rajasthan High Court in India sent the stock tumbling 15 per cent to 7.3p.\n\nRum, gin and vodka maker Distil suffered a hangover after a slump in half-year revenues\n\nThe firm originally filed the claim in September last year against the government of the state following the rejection of a prospecting license application from its joint venture partner, however, since then the process has been hit by several delays, the most recent being due to \u2018staff shortages\u2019 at the court.\n\nRum, gin and vodka maker Distil suffered a hangover after a slump in half-year revenues due to \u2018challenges\u2019 in its core markets sent the stock tumbling 20 per cent to 0.7p.\n\nRevenue in the six months to the end of September fell to \u00a3824,000 from \u00a31.16 million in the same period of 2018, while gross profit declined 30 per cent to \u00a3499,000 from \u00a3710,000.\n\nTroubled phone app and game distributor Mobile Streams plunged 32 per cent to 0.2p after telling investors that it had still not managed to find a new nominated advisor, a requirement to trade on the AIM market.
