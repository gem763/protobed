It drew heightened attention because of the circumstances surrounding it.\n\nCedeno said he had suffered years of physical and emotional abuse because he was gay and then lashed out in self-defence against students who had been afflicting him.\n\nJustice Michael Gross of State Supreme Court in the Bronx rejected that defence in July after a bench trial and found Cedeno guilty of first-degree manslaughter, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gross declined to grant a request by defence lawyers that their client be treated as a youthful offender, saying that a history of being bullied could not be seen as a \u201clicense for murderous rage.\u201d\n\nCedeno, wearing a pinkish shirt and with his hair dyed red, sat impassively through Ms Providence\u2019s statement and the sentencing.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

His explosion of rage has left so many lives in ruins, including his own.\u201d\n\nAfter the fatal stabbing, Cedeno\u2019s case became something of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Some gay rights advocates rallied to his defence, seeing him as emblematic of young people who are abused because of their sexuality.\n\nMembers of the LGBTQ community argued that the school should have taken action against those who had bullied a gay student.\n\nCedeno was represented at no charge by two openly gay lawyers, Christopher Lynn and Robert Feldman, who said the proceedings were a \u201cgay pride trial.\u201d\n\nCedeno also had the support of several elected officials, including City Councilman Rub\u00e9n D\u00edaz, who has been criticised for making homophobic remarks but helped Cedeno post bail soon after he was charged.\n\nMr D\u00edaz also wrote a letter to the judge, urging leniency in the sentencing of Cedeno, who lives in his district in the Bronx.\n\nIt emerged during the trial that Cedeno had bought an illegal switchblade online for $44.89 (\u00a336.41). He testified that he obtained it for protection after years of abuse.\n\nOn that day in 2017, after students threw crumpled pieces of paper and broken pencils that he thought were meant for him, he said, he flicked it open, then waited in a defensive posture, with the blade extended.\n\nOther students who testified said that Cedeno started the fight and that he was the one who had used homophobic slurs. The lead prosecutor, Nancy Borko, told Gross that Cedeno had practised with the switchblade and was looking for a fight with \u201chis trusty new knife.\u201d\n\nMr Laboy\u2019s mother, Felicia Laboy, also addressed the court Tuesday, telling Gross that although she was the \u201cmore fortunate of the two mothers,\u201d the attack by Cedeno had \u201cdevastated my son and deeply affected my family.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lost his best friend, his childhood, his joyful nature,\u201d she said, adding that Mr Laboy is now home-schooled because his hand was injured so badly that he cannot hold a pen.\n\nMs Borko told the court that Cedeno\u2019s conduct had been \u201cintentional and violent\u201d and that he had shown little remorse while trying to minimise his actions. She asked Gross to sentence Cedeno to 30 years in prison, partly as a way to bring justice to the families of his victims.\n\n\u201cThere is no pain equal to that of a mother who has lost her child to unexpected violence,\u201d she told the judge. \u201cThe order of the universe is reversed.\u201d\n\nLynn countered that Cedeno had accepted responsibility for his actions and urged the judge to consider mitigating factors in his sentence.\n\nCedeno had no previous criminal history, Lynn said, was not a danger to anyone, was not likely to become a danger and had garnered letters of support from prominent people who believed that he could go on to lead a productive life.\n\nCedeno addressed the court in a halting voice, pausing frequently as he told Gross that he was not the same person he had been two years earlier and that he regretted the pain he had visited upon others.\n\n\u201cI know that I was the one who brought in a knife,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI wish I could take it all back.\u201d\n\nGross said he believed that Cedeno had been bullied but noted that he had testified that he had not really known his victims and that they had not tormented him. He added that on the day of the stabbings, he had issued an \u201cobscenity-laced invitation\u201d to fight.\n\nMatthew \u201cdied within minutes on the floor of that classroom,\u201d Gross said. \u201cWith his passing died a future of boundless dreams.\u201d\n\nA few moments later, Cedeno rose unsteadily to his feet and was handcuffed before being taken from the courtroom. From the left side of the gallery, faces stared at him. On the right side, some people raised a hand.\n\n\u201cWe love you, baby,\u201d called one supporter, as Cedeno appeared to nod in acknowledgment before being escorted away by court officers.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Lacey Providence vividly remembers the day two years ago that a pair of detectives at a hospital in the Bronx told her that her 15-year-old nephew had \u201csuccumbed\u201d to injuries after being stabbed in school by a teenage classmate.
