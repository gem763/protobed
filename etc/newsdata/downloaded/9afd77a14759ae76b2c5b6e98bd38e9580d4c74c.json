In the Name of Love, Baby Love and You Keep Me Hangin' On.\n\nShe went solo in 1970 and enjoyed more worldwide success with songs that encompassed '70s disco, '80s ballads and pop number ones.\n\nThe Detroit singer declared she was \"no stranger to the UK,\" having lived there with her husband, Arne Naess, and family.\n\nDream dates\n\n\"It was a glorious time,\" she recalled. \"It is an honour and a privilege to sing and dream, every concert is a blessing and a gift, I am filled with excitement and huge appreciation.
