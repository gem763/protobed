(iStock)\n\nColumnist\n\nIf you\u2019re covered under Medicare, don\u2019t let complacency prevent you from reviewing your health insurance options and maybe saving some money.\n\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins Oct. 15 and ends Dec. 7. It is during this period that those covered by Medicare \u2014 people 65 and older \u2014 can change their health plan and prescription drug coverage for 2020.\n\nFor many people, the Medicare open-enrollment process can be confusing with its alphabet plans. Part A is hospital insurance, Part B is medical insurance, Part C is Medicare Advantage (offered by private companies approved by Medicare such as an HMO) and Part D is prescription drug coverage. Even if you\u2019ve been happy with your coverage, open enrollment is the time to double check what you have and make changes.\n\n[It's a good deal for most older Americans but Medicare is neither free nor easy]\n\nYou should have received your \u201cPlan Annual Notice of Change,\u201d which lists any changes in your plan, such as a possible increase in cost or coverage areas. It\u2019s important that you review this document. The notice will compare the benefits in 2020 with those you\u2019re currently receiving. Be sure to check your prescription drug plan to ensure that the medications you need will still be covered. If a drug you take is no longer covered, you may want to switch plans. If you didn\u2019t get your notice, which should have been mailed last month, contact your plan.\n\nTo help you review your options, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have redesigned the \u201cMedicare Plan Finder\u201d on medicare.gov\n\nMedicare\u2019s redesigned Plan Finder makes it easier to compare coverage options and shop for plans.\n\nWe\u2019ve just updated the Medicare Plan Finder with 2020 \u2b50 ratings for #Medicare health & drug plans. Star ratings help you compare the quality of health & drug plans as you review coverage options during #MedicareOE, which starts Tuesday, Oct. 15. https://t.co/ttRZpQVVtr pic.twitter.com/6n1eSLonRn \u2014 Medicare.gov (@MedicareGov) October 11, 2019\n\nIn reviewing your plan, don\u2019t just focus on prices. You should balance affordability with coverage, making sure your plan provides the health services you need.\n\nThe nonprofit Medicare Rights Center has put together a free online reference tool that can help walk you thorough your choices. The consumer service organization also pointed out some updates for 2020:\n\n\u2014 This year, Medicare Advantage Plans were allowed more flexibility in offering certain benefits such as nutrition services or in-home supports, and home modifications. In 2020, plans are allowed to offer more services to certain members with chronic conditions.\n\n\u2014 The average Medicare prescription drug plan premium for 2020 is down slightly to $32.74 per month from $33.19.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) addresses some common questions in its Medicare open enrollment FAQs section. For example, here are a few questions answered by KFF.\n\n\u201cQ: My husband and I are retired. He just turned 65 and is covered under Medicare, but I am 62 and don\u2019t have health insurance. As the spouse of a Medicare beneficiary, can I enroll in Medicare during the open enrollment period?\n\n\u201cKFF: No. Although your husband now qualifies for Medicare, you will not qualify for Medicare until you turn age 65. If you do not have health insurance now, you can consider signing up for health insurance coverage through a Marketplace plan\n\n\u201cQ: I didn\u2019t sign up for Part B when I first became eligible, but want to sign up now. I know there is a penalty for late enrollment. Is there any way to avoid the penalty?\n\n\u201cKFF: Generally, no. In most cases, if you missed your Part B enrollment window, which runs from the three months before the month of your 65th birthday through the three months after the month of your 65th birthday, you will face a late enrollment penalty once you do enroll, which will be added to your premium costs for the remainder of your enrollment. The penalty equals 10 percent of the standard monthly premium for each 12-month period that you delayed enrollment.\n\n\u201cIf you did not enroll for Part B during your initial enrollment period, you may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) to sign up for Part B (and/or Part A) anytime as long as you or a spouse is working and you\u2019re covered by a group health plan through that employment. For people age 65 or over who have coverage through a group health plan, there is also an 8-month SEP, which starts the month after the employment ends, or the group health plan coverage ends. If you sign up during an SEP, the late enrollment penalty will not apply.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part B click here.\n\nFor more information on the late penalty for Part D click here.\n\nIf you need help with Medicare, call 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227) or go to Medicare.gov.\n\nRead more:\n\nDon\u2019t get paralyzed by open enrollment \u2014 just do it\n\nGetting the most out of Medicare\n\nYour Thoughts\n\nDo you review your plan during Medicare open enrollment?

He shared how he budgets for irregular expenses.\n\nFor example, for vacations to Ocean City, MD, he sets aside money every month during the year for real estate taxes (home paid off), home repairs and heating oil. He does the same for car repairs. \u201cLife has taught me it is critical to have a significant sum available when something big happens to the car,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBudgeting $300 a month allows you to breath a little easier when you get a repair bill for $1,200. And trust me this is not an IF, rather it is a WHEN \u2026 I can sleep much easier knowing I have tried to anticipate expenses before they arrive.\u201d\n\nRead: The make-or-break factor in retirement: Keeping a budget\n\nSubscribe and stay informed\n\nIf you\u2019re viewing this post online sign up to automatically receive Michelle Singletary\u2019s newsletters right into your email box: \u201cYour Retirement\u201d on Mondays and \u201cPersonal Finance\u201d on Thursdays\n\nRead and share Michelle Singletary\u2019s Color of Money Column on Wednesdays and Sundays in The Washington Post.
