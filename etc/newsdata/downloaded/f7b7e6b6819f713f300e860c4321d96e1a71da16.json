Kaelin Jr, Sir Peter J. Radcliffe and Gregg L. Semenza. They've been awarded nine million Swedish kronor, which is approximately Rs 6.45 crores.\n\nProf. William G. Kaelin currently works at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the US. Gregg L. Semenza is the director of the Vascular Research Program at the John Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering. Sir Peter Ratcliffe is the director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London as well as the director of the Target Discovery Institute in Oxford.\n\nTheir discovery unravelled the molecular machinery that monitors and regulates the activity of genes with respect to varying oxygen levels. This discovery is said to be a major inclusion to the scientific understanding of the role oxygen plays for animals, specifically their cellular structure.\n\nDon't Miss 44.8 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 4.6 K SHARES 1.3 K SHARES 884 SHARES\n\nWhile everyone knew how important oxygen is in an anima's body to transform food into usable energy, very little was known about how cells adapt to constantly changing oxygen levels.\n\nNobel Prize\n\nAccording to the Jury, \"Intense ongoing efforts in academic laboratories and pharmaceutical companies are now focused on developing drugs that can interfere with different disease states by either activating or blocking, the oxygen-sensing machinery.\"\n\nThe jury further added, \"However, the amount of oxygen available to cells, tissues and animals themselves can vary greatly. This prize is for three physician-scientists who found the molecular switch that regulates how our cells adapt when oxygen levels drop.\"\n\nThis discovery has created a path for curing life-threatening diseases like Cancer, anaemia etc.", "description": "The Nobel Prize is one of the most important achievements for scientists in different fields and in today's declaration of the Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine three scientists won the prestigious award for their work on cells and how they adapt to available oxygen.", "authors": ["Monit Khanna"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/nobel_prize_1570446918_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
