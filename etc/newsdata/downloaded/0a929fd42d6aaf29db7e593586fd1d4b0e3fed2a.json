I am doing this due to pressure on MIT and me over a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations.\u201d\n\nThe FSF announced Stallman\u2019s resignation as president and from its board of directors.\n\nMIT was already at the center of the Epstein storm, in the wake of revelations that its Media Lab accepted $7.5m in funding from the disgraced financier or a group of donors connected to him. Media lab director Joi Ito resigned.\n\nStallman\u2019s emails came to light after an MIT graduate, Selam Jie Gano, published a Medium post calling for his removal.\n\nAccording to the Medium post, Stallman wrote in response to a student\u2019s message about an event protesting the acceptance of Epstein\u2019s money. The emails, which were published by Vice were sent to a CSail mailing list.\n\nReferring to Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, who alleged in court papers she was sent to have sex with the late MIT cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, Stallman wrote: \u201cWe can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing.\n\n\u201cAssuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates.\u201d\n\nWhen a student on the email thread noted that Giuffre was allegedly forced into sex at 17, Stallman responded: \u201cIt is morally absurd to define \u2018rape\u2019 in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.\u201d\n\nStallman added: \u201cAll I know [Giuffre] said about Minsky is that Epstein directed her to have sex with Minsky. That does not say whether Minsky knew that she was coerced.\n\n\u201cWe know that Giuffre was being coerced into sex \u2013 by Epstein. She was being harmed. But the details do affect whether, and to what extent, Minsky was responsible for that.\u201d\n\nMinsky died in 2016, aged 88.\n\nStallman, 66, has contributed to the Guardian. On Monday he posted a statement to his website before his resignations were made public. Reports about his views on Epstein were \u201cmisleading\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThe coverage totally mischaracterised my statement. Headlines say that I defended Epstein. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve called him a \u2018serial rapist\u2019, and said he deserved to be imprisoned. But many people now believe I defended him \u2013 and other inaccurate claims \u2013 and feel a real hurt because of what they believe I said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for that hurt. I wish I could have prevented the misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u2018This should not be happening\u2019: the whistleblower who exposed MIT\u2019s Epstein scandal Read more\n\nOn Monday MIT Media Lab academic Neri Oxman apologised for \u201chaving received funds from Epstein, and deeply apologize to my students for their inadvertent involvement in this mess\u201d.\n\nIn a statement to magazine Dezeen, Oxman said she had been told to keep the $125,000 2015 donation confidential, \u201cso as not to enhance [Epstein\u2019s] reputation by association with MIT\u201d.\n\nHarvard received $9m from Epstein prior to his 2008 guilty plea to state-level prostitution charges in Florida.\n\nEpstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself in jail last month while awaiting federal sex trafficking charge.\n\nProsecutors alleged that some of his victims were as young as 14.", "description": "Emails written by Richard Stallman leaked as Massachusetts college at center of storm over Epstein funding", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe6f291d08de84d684f23c04715e37cc0e1d5966/154_0_5908_3545/master/5908.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=146511f3f6e048e9bc6a5f08aa820da4", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
