Many of his close family members are there, including his widow, along with a team of senior officials.\n\nLast Friday evening, Emmerson Mnangagwa, president of Zimbabwe, declared Mugabe a \u201cnational hero\u201d and ordered days of mourning before the burial. He did not give any details of funeral arrangements, but his choice of words suggested he wanted to see Mugabe buried in the National Heroes Acre, a monument to the heroes of the war that overturned the white supremacist regime in the former British colony.\n\nDesigned by Zimbabwean and North Korean architects, the plot has a commanding view of Harare and features a huge bronze statue of three guerrilla fighters and an eternal flame on a 40-metre tower.\n\nIt would be very awkward for Mnangagwa and others if the funeral is in Zvimba and a family affair Blessing-Miles Tendi\n\nThough much of Mugabe\u2019s 37 years in power was marked by violence, economic mismanagement and corruption, the former guerrilla fighter is still revered as a liberation leader. Many in Zimbabwe see him as a national hero, remembering his role in the war against white rule.\n\nFlags flew at half-mast yesterday, but there were no public activities to mark the death of a man whose legacy includes a shattered economy, pariah status on the international stage and a repressive political system dominated by the ruling party.\n\nThe state-run Herald newspaper, which vilified Mugabe when he was forced to resign and when he subsequently voiced support for the opposition, carried glowing tributes.\n\nIn a \u201ccommemorative edition\u201d the newspaper, which often acts as a mouthpiece of the government, praised Mugabe for \u201chis uncompromising stance when it came to the rights of Africans\u201d.\n\nA major ceremony and burial at the National Heroes Acre would allow the new rulers of Zimbabwe to showcase their respect for the man they ousted after nearly 40 years in power.\n\n\u201cIt would be very awkward for Mnangagwa and others if the funeral is in Zvimba and a family affair \u2026 They have always justified their actions as targeting those around [Mugabe], not him, and made a point of treating him well. This is the last act and they need to get it right,\u201d said Blessing-Miles Tendi, an associate professor of African politics at Oxford University and author.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Zimbabwe\u2019s current leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, has declared Mugabe a national hero, but not everyone agrees.

A senior party official told the Observer: \u201cThe family is being engaged intensely. The funeral is state funded, all expenses paid to Singapore and back, so that should aid the process.\n\n\u201cThere have been discussions before on this matter \u2026 It has been going on for months now. Before such news gets to the public, a long process of engagement takes place.\n\n\u201cThe five family members who went to Singapore have yet to come back, and those who are here are also engaging in discussions among themselves.\u201d\n\nMugabe\u2019s relatives are themselves also divided over the location and nature of the funeral. The late president\u2019s nephew, Leo Mugabe, said a decision had yet to be taken but denied that his uncle had given explicit instructions about his final resting place.\n\n\u201cWe are just waiting for the repatriation of the body before the full programme is known. We also had never discussed with my uncle before he died where he wanted to be buried so it\u2019s still unclear,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokesman for Zanu-PF, Simon Khaya Moyo, said a Heroes Acre burial was inevitable for Mugabe unless his family decided otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe body is not yet here so we cannot be certain on the burial arrangements,\u201d Moyo said. \u201cThe family is already discussing among themselves. He was declared a national hero and ordinarily he should be buried at the National Heroes Acre but it\u2019s up to the family and up to what he wanted himself, which we will only know when the body arrives.\u201d\n\nMugabe was the most prominent surviving member of the generation who fought to free their countries from European colonial rule in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe death of Mugabe signals that the era of the 1960s liberation movement leadership is drawing to a close,\u201d said Piers Pigou, an expert on Zimbabwe with the International Crisis Group.\n\nMillions of Zimbabweans now face malnutrition, soaring inflation, up to 80% unemployment and a crumbling infrastructure. Medicines are in short supply and power cuts are common.\n\n\u201cEnd of an era as Mugabe dies, leaves Zim poor, divided,\u201d read the front-page headline of a privately owned newspaper in Zimbabwe, the Daily News.\n\nTendai Biti, a former finance minister and opposition politician who was tortured by Mugabe\u2019s henchmen, said the dictator was a product of an era of struggle. \u201cHe was a victim of the system he created. The revolution ate its own children and he was the first-born child of that revolution,\u201d said Biti, who is an MP and vice-president of the Movement for Democratic Change.", "description": "Zimbabwe\u2019s liberator turned dictator is proving as troublesome to the coup leaders in death as he was in life", "authors": ["Jason Burke", "Nyasha Chingono"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b74f6c420e1a051656b9cba4b379553b2ccb83e9/0_167_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c71bcd01842c21a76c80be51128b46c6", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
