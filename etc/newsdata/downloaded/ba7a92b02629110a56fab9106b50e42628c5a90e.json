Does she feel pressure to score at all? \u201cI\u2019m not going to put that pressure on myself, no,\u201d Miedema said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the type of player I am.\u201d", "description": "Vivianne Miedema may have made a habit of smashing goalscoring records but she insists hitting the back of the net is not her top priority.", "authors": ["Sophie Penney", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000211033468-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOnF-pGyuMayIW5_daymjxlYWHf9y8mJOlf1-Oajhd-g.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
