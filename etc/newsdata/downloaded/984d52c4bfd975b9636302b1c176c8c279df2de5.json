His sister has since vowed to get rid of the vehicle which leaked toxic fumes\n\nDillon had posted pictures of a Volkswagen Golf GTI on the day of his death. Roxann has since commented on the post, vowing to get rid of the vehicle.\n\nRoxann, had raised Dillon herself from the age of just 16 and said he had dreamed of owning his own garage one day.\n\n'Dillon was a lovely, handsome, a gentle giant with a smile that could light up even the darkest room.\n\n'He loved his cars and was forever modifying them, with purple wheels or gold coloured engines. He loved his cars, he was a real petrolhead. He dreamed one day of having his own garage with his friend Luke.\n\n'Dillon was always loving and friendly. He was always doing something with his car. He was never in a dark place as long as he could drive. He would thrive off his cars and driving them.\n\nDillon (pictured above) was obsessed with cars and had used them to help him get over the death of his parents\n\n'As soon as he got paid he spent it all on doing a car up and selling it on for more value. He was a proper Del Boy like that.'\n\nSpeaking to Hull Live, heartbroken Roxann said Dillon had a tough life through his teenage years but had always managed to stay strong.\n\nTheir parents died two weeks apart from one another and in 2015 Dillon discovered their mother dead at their home. But Roxann said Dillon was able to find solace in fixing cars.\n\nShe added: 'He didn't have a bad upbringing at all, just a very emotional one. He loved time to himself and was always in his car or fixing someone else's - his car was his man cave on wheels.'\n\nIt was Dillon's friend who discovered him and Roxann said she received a phone call from him after he discovered the car in the Homebase carpark.\n\n'The windows were steamed up so you couldn't see if anyone was inside,' she said. 'Then all I heard was screaming down the other end of the phone.\n\n'That's when I knew.'\n\nHis sister Roxann paid tributes to her brother and the picture above shows a floral tribute which has been left\n\nDillon had posted on Facebook the day before his death and was thought to have been trying to sell the car he died in\n\nShe says her brother had fallen asleep and the exhaust fumes seeping into the vehicle from a hole in the pipe caused her brother's death.\n\nRoxann added: 'He went through so much in his short life, he had so much more to live for, so much to look forward to.\n\n'He was just chilling out in his car, reclined in his seat. He used to visit the car park to use the wifi and watch movies on his phone.\n\n'I'm still absolutely devastated. So many people have said nasty things about my brother at the time, but he didn't have a bad bone in his body and would do anything for anyone. He really would.'", "description": "Dillon Denton (pictured), who was described by friends as a 'gentle giant', was found unresponsive by his friend while parked outside a Homebase in Hull.
