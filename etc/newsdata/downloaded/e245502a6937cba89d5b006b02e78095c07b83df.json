President Trump is not wrong about that.\n\nThe job of the president, though, is to balance the understandable desire of Americans to no longer bear every burden and oppose any foe to ensure the survival of freedom with the fact that U.S. interests and values still require us to remain engaged around the world in a sustainable way.", "description": "It\u2019s pure genius!", "authors": ["Thomas L.
