And the recent Finovate conference in London consisted mainly of 'alt fi' companies pitching their services at banks rather than consumers.\n\nBut the risk is that as the sector becomes more mainstream, it may also become less attractive.\n\nIt\u2019s like when your parents joined Facebook. The social media platform suddenly became less cool when your mum started liking your posts and sharing your baby pictures.\n\nFacebook has seen a drop off in users in the 16 to 24 age group and has previously warned in a recent annual report that a lack of appeal to the younger generation was a key risk.\n\nThe same seems to be happening in crowdfunding and peer-to-peer.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t an argument that old people will spoil the broth. Crowdfunding is for all ages and all types of people, that\u2019s the beauty of it.\n\nBut with institutions getting involved it no longer has that jazzy alternative tag which in the long run could hit its popularity.\n\nFinancial technology conferences used to be full of computer nerds pushing their apps or groundbreaking software to consumers. Now they are pushing it straight to the banks.\n\nThe sector has already been placed under stricter regulation for borrowers and investors, which is a good thing, but now we are seeing more premium types of private-equity style crowdfunding aimed at higher net worth individuals with high minimum investments, essentially shutting out the little guy who wants to invest. That all sounds a bit familiar doesn\u2019t it?\n\nToast to success: Craft beer maker BrewDog has built its business through Crowdfunding\n\nIf the industry was more weighted towards private equity, would we have seen such successful campaigns for easyProperty, JustPark or BrewDog, all of which value being able to let smaller investors get involved?\n\nWasn\u2019t that the whole reason crowdfunding emerged, because banks where shutting out the smaller businesses and those with less to invest? But now some of the crowdfunding platforms are effectively shutting out the crowd.\n\nFormer Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Adair Turner recently joined the debate about the future of the sector and explained why the \u2018old school\u2019 should be staying away.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said: \u2018The losses which will emerge from peer-to-peer lending over the next five to 10 years will make the bankers look like lending geniuses.\u2019\n\nTo be fair to him, there have been a number of peer-to-peer and crowdfunding failures recently. Claims management company Rebus, which raised \u00a3816,000 on Crowdcube last year, collapsed earlier this month. But the amounts pale into insignificance against bank bailouts.\n\nThe Peer2Peer Finance Association says his views fly in the face of evidence and overlook regulation of the sector and the due diligence done on firms.\n\nThere are of course extra risks in this sector due to a lack of Financial Services Compensation Scheme protection, but default rates tend to be low and you get better rates for taking more risk.\n\nWhile the big boys from the banking world may be coming in and pushing up the cost of equity-based crowdfunding, reward and donation-based schemes are actually thriving on their own.\n\nDonation-based crowdfunding \u2013 where no return is expected \u2013 grew the fastest among all alternative finance models in 2015, with a 507 per cent year-on-year growth rate, albeit with just \u00a312 million distributed.\n\nReward-based crowdfunding \u2013 where returns don\u2019t have to be financial \u2013 increased 62 per cent year-on-year to \u00a342million.\n\nThis type of platform is becoming this popular, for example, there is one launching in April called Gifted Deposit where would-be first-time buyers can pitch for help to fund a mortgage deposit, without expecting anything financial in return.\n\nOne platform, Crowdfunder, has seen an increase in reward and donation-based projects.\n\nAround 20 per cent of its projects have a social enterprise slant and there is no financial reward. It has raised almost \u00a31million for social enterprises across the UK.\n\nI have recently joined in and launched my own social enterprise reward-based crowdfunding campaign on Crowdfunder to fund speech therapy lessons for my dad that are no longer available on the NHS.\n\nHe suffers from Parkinson\u2019s and we want to make an awareness-raising documentary charting his progress in the hope that he can overcome a speech impediment to speak at our sister\u2019s wedding in August.\n\nI have been relying on the support of friends and family and social media, and so far we are halfway towards our target.\n\nI haven\u2019t needed any big banks, fund managers, or men in suits. No-one wants a financial return. They just want to help.", "description": "Small businesses and individuals are flocking to the crowd to get projects or enterprises funded.
