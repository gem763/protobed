If the two suspects voluntarily identified themselves, there would only be a police log entry.\n\nBut Johnson refused to kowtow to the demands of the police officers, becoming argumentative and refusing to identify herself or let officers fingerprint her.\n\nA police officer then told her that she would have to be arrested for obstruction. But Johnson allegedly grew more more violent the more police tried to control her.\n\nWDJT reported that she allegedly punched one officer in the chest while a second officer in the scuffle could be heard yelling in the background, \u201cShe just bit me!\u201d\n\nOfficers then used a taser to subdue Johnson before placing her in handcuffs.\n\nJohnson is facing one count of battery to a law enforcement officer.\n\nJohnson\u2019s mother said her daughter \u201csuffered tremendously\u201d at the hands of law enforcement and criticized officers for violating her rights.\n\n\u201cShe was not under arrest. She didn\u2019t break any laws.
