It was then forced into liquidation.\n\nThe case relates to an incident in 2010 when former leaders Julius Malema, Andile Lili and Floyd Shivambu allegedly referred to Zille as a racist.\n\nThe structure is currently fighting to have its liquidation rescinded.\n\nThe task team held a media briefing on Monday where its convener, Sibongile Besani, said the source of its liquidation was its debt.\n\nBesani added that the ANC as the league's mother body had an obligation to take that responsibility.\n\nWhen asked if the league was financially capable of going to conference, he said: \"We are under liquidation now but if we were to strictly confine ourselves to financial jargon we would say no.\n\n\"Our assets don't exceed our liabilities but because we are within the mother body, we know it walks step by step with the youth league so I don't think we should dislodge the youth league from the ANC.\"\n\nThe cost for conferences, which bring together members from across the country, could run into millions, as operational, hotel and food bills pile up.\n\nThe ANC, however, is still suffering from its own financial challenges.\n\nRecently, City Press reported that one service provider was suing the party for R5.7m after it failed to pay for the 595 cars it rented for the 2017 Nasrec conference.\n\nDuring his final report as treasurer-general at the conference, Zweli Mkhize said the party was technically insolvent as its liabilities exceeded the value of its assets.\n\nThe task team also co-opted more women to join the structure after it was criticised internally for featuring a predominantly male team.\n\nWhen the structure was first introduced, those who advocated for the disbandment of the youth league criticised the national executive committee for installing a task team that mirrored the old one. This is the third task team appointed to help the structure get to conference.\n\nZuko Godlimpi was among the leaders of the disbandment faction.\n\nHe told News24 earlier the task team needed to have members of the youth league who were 14 to 35 years old.\n\nThe party, however, argued that those within the task team needed to have institutional memory to facilitate the conference.\n\nThose already included in the task team are former league presidents Malusi Gigaba, Fikile Mbalula, Collen Maine and Lulu Johnson.\n\nFemale leaders who will join the task team include Gumani Mukwevho, Joy Maimela, Loyiso Lugayeni-Masuku, Mbali Hlophe, Precious Banda, Sizophila Mkhize, Tasneem Motara and Tlangi Mogale.", "description": "\"We are under liquidation now but if we were to strictly confine ourselves to financial jargon we would say no, our assets don't exceed our liabilities but because we are within the mother body, we know it walks step by step with the youth league so I don't think we should dislodge the youth league from the ANC.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7686/51c1dd79c7134625a1545acae8ec8955.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
