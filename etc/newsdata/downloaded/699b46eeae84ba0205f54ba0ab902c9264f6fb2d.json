That was faster than the 23.2% gain reported for the first half.\n\nThe announcement followed U.S.-Chinese trade talks in Washington that ended Friday with no word of progress on resolving Huawei's status.\n\nThe Trump administration, which accuses Huawei of being a security risk, imposed curbs in May on its access to U.S. technology and components including Google's music, maps and other smartphone services.\n\nWashington has delayed enforcement and suggested it might allow sales of some U.S. technology. But Huawei's chairman, Liang Hua, warned in July it would \"face difficulties\" in the second half.\n\nHuawei says it is removing U.S. components from its smartphones and network gear and has announced its own phone operating system to replace Google's Android if necessary.\n\nBut no non-U.S. supplier can fully replace Google music, maps and other services. Industry analysts say that might threaten Huawei's status as the No. 2 global smartphone brand behind Samsung by sales volume.\n\nHuawei said smartphone shipments rose 26% in the first nine months of 2019 over a year earlier, to 185 million units.\n\nU.S. security warnings focus on Huawei's status as the biggest supplier of network gear that forms the heart of telecom networks. Huawei denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or might install \"backdoors\" in its equipment for eavesdropping.\n\nThe company, China's first global tech brand, is a leader in next-generation network technology meant to support self-driving cars and other new applications. Its increased reach makes 5G technology more politically sensitive.\n\nWashington is lobbying European and other allies to ban Huawei from plans to upgrade networks to 5G. Germany, France and Ireland say they have no plans to ban any supplier.\n\nA U.S. official on Tuesday warned that Washington would reconsider sharing intelligence with allies that use Huawei network equipment.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
