My best friend is Little Bean, my dog. Last year, when I was taking Little Bean for a walk, he was almost hit by a car. Luckily, I was able to grab him in time and he wasn\u2019t hurt.\n\nFrom that day on, I promised I would take better care of him and treasure our time together. I don\u2019t want to lose my best friend.\n\nLee Sin-ching, 13, STFA Tam Pak Yu College\n\nMy friends are like my family. They\u2019ve become a big part of my life, even though I\u2019ve only known them for a year. They\u2019ve made my university life more fun, and have been very supportive.\n\nThe best part about our friendship is that they always come to my home to celebrate Indian festivals with me. It makes me feel like India is not as far away. I love you guys!\n\nAnushka Purohit, 19, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n\nBest Friends Forever #4: Shared memories\n\nI have three best friends: Sarah, Jasper, and Battmin. They were my classmates in primary school and they are in secondary school, too. When I feel upset they are very good at comforting me. I love them very much and I think we will be best friends forever.\n\nKayla Lau Ka-yeung, 13, STFA Tam Pak Yu College\n\nWords cannot fully express how much I love my best friend. She\u2019s been one of my closest friends since I was 10 and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to have her as my friend. Whether we go out to eat or are dancing around in my room, I wouldn\u2019t trade the time I spend with her for the world.\n\nOne of my favourite moments with her was when we attended a course at Capstone. After our first class, we debated the concepts we had learned about without getting mad at each other, even though we had different opinions. It was then that I knew that I could be myself around her without being judged. If you\u2019re reading this, know that I love you!\n\nVanya Aditi Pardal, 15, Canadian International School of Hong Kong\n\nSpotting your frenemy and how to deal with one\n\nI have a best friend I can share everything with. Her name is Taylor. We met in classroom 1D. She is hard-working and helpful. I\u2019ve learned so much from her. While others are very noisy and play games in class, she always stays focused and studies. I admire her for that and hope I can learn more from her.\n\nWhen I\u2019m stuck on a maths problem, she helps me solve it. She\u2019s super patient and always willing to help others. I also know that my secrets are safe with her. I hope we\u2019ll always be this close.\n\nChau Yu-yan, 14, Po Leung Kuk Ma Kam Ming Secondary School\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda\n\nIf you would like to tell us about your BFF, send your story to yp@scmp.com, and attach a jpg of you and your pal.
