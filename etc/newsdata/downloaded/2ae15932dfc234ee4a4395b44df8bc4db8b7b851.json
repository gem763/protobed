At the time, private developers in much of the city were required to provide a parking space for four out of every 10 apartments in their buildings. But city officials, concerned about worsening air pollution, eventually pumped the brakes.\n\nIn 1982, the city effectively banned any new public parking lots in Manhattan below West 110th Street, while also sharply limiting private garages there by inverting the old rules: Parking would no longer be required, and in fact had limits. Today, the number of parking spaces cannot exceed 20 percent of the total number of apartments in buildings from Midtown down to Manhattan\u2019s southern tip, while a 35 percent cap applies to the Upper East and West Sides.\n\nBut efforts to discourage driving by making it tougher to park may not have had the desired effect. Indeed, cars are on the rise, or at least holding their own. In 2017, there were 225,179 non-taxi cars registered in Manhattan, on par with 2007, when there were 225,047, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, which counts cars used for ride-share services like Uber in its totals.\n\nThe spikes in the other boroughs have been dramatic. In Brooklyn, there were 457,980 cars in 2017, up from 387,328 in 2007, according to the data, and in Queens there were 725,906, up from 671,816. Added congestion has meant increased demand for the dwindling number of parking spaces, advocates for garages say.\n\nParking for Sale\n\nBesides Greenwich West, other recent Manhattan condos to offer hefty amounts of accessory parking include 70 Vestry Street in TriBeCa, 76 Eleventh Avenue by the High Line and 565 Broome SoHo.", "description": "The latest trends in parking include automated garages, art-lined waiting rooms and six-figure price tags.", "authors": ["C.
