NY Times reveals whistleblower is CIA and readers are furious", "language": "en", "text": "The NY Times is reporting the whistleblower who made the complaint about Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine is a CIA agent who was on a detail to the White House:\n\nThe whistle-blower who revealed that President Trump sought foreign help for his re-election and that the White House sought to cover it up is a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to work at the White House at one point, according to three people familiar with his identity. The man has since returned to the C.I.A., the people said. Little else is known about him. His complaint made public Thursday suggested he was an analyst by training and made clear he was steeped in details of American foreign policy toward Europe, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of Ukrainian politics and at least some knowledge of the law.\n\nThe next section of the Times\u2019 story is devoted to the back and forth over whether or not the Times should have published this information in the first place. The whistleblower\u2019s attorney is not amused, telling the Times, \u201cAny decision to report any perceived identifying information of the whistle-blower is deeply concerning and reckless, as it can place the individual in harm\u2019s way.\u201d That concern was echoed by others on Twitter:\n\nAstonishing for the NYT to essentially out the whistle blower in a story that doesn\u2019t advance what we already knew on the same day the President threatened retribution. \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) September 26, 2019\n\nHe\u2019s referring to Trump\u2019s statement about how to deal with \u201cspies.\u201d But NY Times executive editor Dean Baquet responded the information was essential to establishing the whistleblower\u2019s credibility. Unfortunately for him, lots of left-leaning Times readers aren\u2019t buying that explanation:\n\nTranslation: We at the New York Times really wanted the clicks and views. Therefore, we published information about the whistleblower\u2019s identity because greed is more important than journalistic integrity. \u2014 Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) September 26, 2019\n\nThis is a serious &/dangerous misjudgement. If the whistleblower had approached the @nytimes instead of the IG, by all means it should have verified his credibility privately \u2013 that's standard journalistic practice. But this story is reckless and the justification is laboured. https://t.co/mX9HqHffic \u2014 Martyn McLaughlin (@MartynMcL) September 26, 2019\n\nI think he has a point and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve seen several people make. If the whistleblower were an anonymous source for the Times, they\u2019d be bending over backward to protect him. Since he\u2019s not, they\u2019re outing him.\n\n@deanbaquet this is the wrong decision and it\u2019s not enough to justify exposing the whistleblower. Stop this or declare yourself a partisan hack for the White House. So at least we know who we are dealing with. \ud83d\ude21 \u2014 Arriadna\ud83d\uddfd (@Arriadna) September 26, 2019\n\nThere are hundreds of more responses like this from unhappy progressives. But it\u2019s not just social media where people are reacting stongly to the decision to publish this information. The Times is being dragged on its own site by commenters. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\n\u201cI am stunned the paper would choose to do this. You just gave anyone who might choose to come forward to report a serious governmental wrongdoing ample reason to triple guess that choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, NYT \u2013 don\u2019t go there. Do not identify or help identify the WB\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, New York Times, have given enough detail for any amateur sleuth to find him. Would it hurt to wait a few weeks before releasing information that may imperil this American hero?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is irresponsible of you to so specifically identify the whistleblower. I am disappointed in your editorial decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand the need to wanting to know more and complete information. But good grief, a person\u2019s life could be on the line.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you trying to out this patriot, instead of investigating the crimes of the president? Unbelievable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour actions are irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the world are you thinking?\u201d\n\n\u201cDO NOT OUT THIS HERO!\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat article. All that\u2019s missing is where his kids go to school.\u201d\n\n\u201cReading this story makes me regret having cancelled my subscription. I\u2019d like to be able to cancel it again.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on it goes. And I\u2019m not cherry-picking those examples. I\u2019d say the comments are 80 percent against the Times\u2019 decision to publish in varying degrees, with most of the remainder of comments not taking a position either way. Only a handful of people appear to be standing up for the decision to publish.", "description": "\"What in the world are you thinking?\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/NY-Times.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
