The Intelligence Committee chairman was scheduled to deliver remarks later Monday at an event at the 92nd Street Y in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe conversation will touch on the issues behind today\u2019s biggest news stories, including the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and the impeachment inquiry, the investigation of Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and its implications for 2020, the release of the Mueller report and analysis of his public testimony, the latest foreign policy issues, and more,\u201d according to a 92nd Street Y summary of the event.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4:30 p.m.: Cheney\u2019s remarks prompt Democratic pushback\n\nRep. Liz Cheney\u2019s (R-Wyo.) claim Monday morning that the impeachment inquiry was a factor in the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria has prompted pushback from some Democrats.\n\nIn a tweet, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) shared a link to an article about Cheney\u2019s comments. He argued that within the past week, Trump has \u201cendangered our troops,\u201d \u201callowed ISIS to regroup,\u201d \u201cabandoned our allies\u201d and \u201cempowered\u201d the leaders of Russia and Syria. McGovern used another name for the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cInstead of taking responsibility and standing up to their incompetent leader, the @GOP is blaming Democrats,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn an appearance on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Cheney had said that \u201cthere was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border, and I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n3 p.m.: The full Trump-Ukraine timeline\n\nThe House of Representatives is engaged in a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump. It is focused on his efforts to secure specific investigations in Ukraine that carried political benefits for him \u2014 with indications that there might have been an explicit or implicit quid pro quo involved.\n\nThe Fix has compiled a timeline of relevant events and will continue to update it throughout the impeachment process. Read more here.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Philip Bump and Aaron Blake\n\n1:30 p.m.: Jordan asks what Schiff is hiding\n\nRepublicans have seized on a ruling that Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) cannot participate in Monday\u2019s deposition of Hill as they continue to argue the process should be open to the public.\n\nEven though Gaetz is not a member of the three panels conducting the deposition, he tried to sit in on Monday. After Schiff objected, the question was put to a parliamentarian, who ruled that Gaetz would have to leave.\n\nAD\n\n\u201c@RepAdamSchiff is conducting his secretive impeachment proceedings in the basement of the Capitol, and now he\u2019s kicked @mattgaetz out of today\u2019s deposition,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) tweeted. \u201cThis testimony should be available to every member of Congress and every single American. What is Schiff hiding?\u201d\n\nAD\n\n12:25 p.m.: Trump highlights Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to part ways with Chinese company\n\nTrump returned to Twitter early Monday afternoon to highlight Hunter Biden\u2019s announcement on Sunday that he will step down from his position as a board director of a Chinese investment company and not work for foreign firms if his father is elected president.\n\n\u201cWow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNow watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nABC News announced earlier Monday that it had conducted an interview with Hunter Biden over the weekend, parts of which would begin airing on Tuesday morning.\n\nAD\n\n12:20 p.m.: Parscale ramps up anti-impeachment rhetoric\n\nParscale ramped up his anti-impeachment rhetoric Monday afternoon, claiming Democrats had launched \u201ca seditious conspiracy\u201d and calling on Pelosi to resign.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have crossed over the line of partisan politics and have undertaken a seditious conspiracy to overthrow the people\u2019s president,\u201d Parscale tweeted. \u201cNancy Pelosi should step down for betraying her oath of office and attempting to overthrow our great Republic.\u201d\n\n11:40 a.m.: Lieu pushes back on GOP complaints about closed depositions\n\nRep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) took to Twitter late Monday morning to push back against Republican complaints that House investigators are conducting depositions behind closed doors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhy does GOP keep making process arguments? Because they can\u2019t defend the conduct of @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Lieu tweeted. \u201cHouse Impeachment investigation is like a grand jury investigation. Investigations are not done publicly. And we give more transparency by letting GOP cross examine witnesses.\u201d\n\n11:15 a.m.: Gaetz asked to leave Hill deposition\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who sits on the Judiciary Committee but none of the three panels conducting the impeachment inquiry, attempted Monday to sit in on Hill\u2019s deposition \u201cas a member of Congress,\u201d he said, arguing that \u201cif Adam Schiff and the House Democrats were so proud of their work, they would be willing to show it.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have consistently been arguing that the full transcript of the depositions that the three panels have conducted as part of the impeachment inquiry should be made public, though privately some acknowledge that the exchanges will not necessarily fully undermine the Democrats\u2019 case.\n\nAD\n\nAfter Schiff objected to Gaetz\u2019s presence, the question was put to a parliamentarian to decide, Gaetz said. When the parliamentarian told Gaetz he would have to leave, he did.\n\nSpeaking to reporters afterward, Gaetz continued to deride the proceedings as a \u201csham or charade,\u201d lamenting that because the full House has not voted on an impeachment process, \u201cthere are no rules\u201d and thus his presence should have been permitted.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n10:30 a.m.: Starr says impeachment inquiry \u2018doomed to fail\u2019\n\nDuring a Monday morning appearance on Fox News Channel, former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr said he doesn\u2019t believe Trump committed an impeachable offense \u2014 unlike former president Bill Clinton.\n\nStarr, whose investigation led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment in 1998, has been a vocal critic of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of Trump. In previous Fox News interviews, he said Trump had shown \u201cpoor judgment\u201d in asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens but said nothing has risen to the level of being criminal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything close to an impeachable offense here,\u201d Starr said. He said that Clinton, by contrast, \u201cclearly committed crimes, federal crimes.\u201d\n\nThe Trump impeachment inquiry, Starr added, \u201cis doomed to fail.\u201d\n\nTrump later tweeted video from the interview.\n\n9:50 a.m.: GOP lawmakers call for opening process\n\nAhead of Hill\u2019s closed-door deposition Monday, several Republican lawmakers decried the process, calling for the proceedings to be more transparent to the public.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, the Republicans argued that the depositions should be open and that the full transcripts of closed-doors sessions should be publicly released.\n\n\u201cOur position is that the American public should know about all of the facts,\u201d said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.). \u201cWe want the American public to have all of the information they should have in real time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the process and the substance, there is so much that\u2019s so wrong on this entire clown show,\u201d he added.\n\nRep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) described the current proceedings as a \u201cpartisan star chamber\u201d and said Democrats are leaking \u201cselective things they want for their narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere else in America does that happen?\u201d he asked, adding: \u201cWe want the transcripts released for all the American people so they can see with their own eyes the whole context of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n9:30 a.m.: Attacks against Schiff are escalating online\n\nHours after Trump mused online about whether the Democratic lawmaker leading the impeachment inquiry, Rep. Schiff, should be \u201carrested for treason,\u201d a 53-year-old mother of four in Wisconsin retweeted Trump\u2019s post to her few hundred followers and added her own take.\n\n\u201cSHIFTY SHIFF NEEDS TO BE HUNG,\u201d wrote Jean Spanbauer, a onetime supporter of President Barack Obama. She had adopted Trump\u2019s epithet for the California Democrat, slightly misspelling his name.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, my tweets are pretty passionate,\u201d Spanbauer, who uses a different name online, said in an interview, adding that she doesn\u2019t specifically wish anyone physical harm. \u201cIt hits very close to home for me. What the Democrats are doing to our president, to the office and to the people of this country is disgusting.\u201d\n\nAs Trump and his allies have aimed increasingly caustic language at Schiff in recent days, the attacks have been echoed by supporters on social media who often take the message a step further \u2014 invoking physical violence against one of the most prominent Democrats overseeing the inquiry that threatens Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Isaac Stanley-Becker\n\n9:25 a.m.: Several document deadlines set this week\n\nIn addition to scheduling several depositions, House investigators have set deadlines this week for documents related to the impeachment inquiry for several people and government agencies. Some of those are all but certain to be ignored, given the White House\u2019s letter last week saying it would not cooperate with the inquiry.\n\nHouse Democrats have set Tuesday as the deadline for documents from Giuliani, Vice President Pence, the Department of Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nDuring an appearance Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said \u201cwe will do everything we can to comply\u201d with the subpoena for documents from his department, which focused on the withholding of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nWednesday is the deadline for Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two Giuliani associates who were arrested last week on campaign finance charges. They have helped Giuliani with his investigation of the Bidens.\n\nFriday, meanwhile, is the deadline for documents from the White House and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Trump has said Perry asked him to make the July call to Zelensky, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.\n\n9:05 a.m.: Hill arrives on the Hill for closed-door deposition\n\nHill, the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser, has arrived on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition with three House panels as part of the impeachment inquiry. Her interview is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m.\n\nShe is appearing under subpoena.\n\n9 a.m.: White House says Trump not expected in public today\n\nThe White House has called a travel/photo lid for the day, meaning reporters are not expected to see Trump in public on Monday.\n\nTrump has no public events scheduled on this Columbus Day holiday. He has already tweeted several times about impeachment, but apparently he will not be commenting in person about the proceedings before Tuesday.\n\n8 a.m.: Trump\u2019s former top Russia adviser to testify in impeachment probe\n\nHill is expected to speak to House investigators behind closed doors Monday at 10 a.m. about how the administration\u2019s Ukraine policies were influenced by Giuliani\u2019s efforts to have the country investigate Hunter Biden, the former vice president\u2019s son.\n\nHill served as the president\u2019s top Russia and Europe adviser on the National Security Council from mid-2017 until the week before Trump and Zelensky spoke in a July 25 phone call that is at the heart of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nA transcript of the phone call shows that during the exchange, Trump asked Zelensky for a \u201cfavor,\u201d requesting Ukrainian officials look into a debunked conspiracy theory regarding the 2016 election and the energy company Burisma, which paid Hunter Biden to sit on its board.\n\nHill will be the third high-ranking current or former diplomat that the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform committees will depose as part of their accelerating impeachment probe.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian\n\n7 a.m.: ABC News says Hunter Biden interview will air on Tuesday\n\nABC News announced that it had interviewed Hunter Biden over the weekend at his Los Angeles home and said portions of the interview would begin airing Tuesday morning.\n\nTrump has been relentless in making unsubstantiated claims that Hunter Biden was involved in corrupt dealings in Ukraine and China and has made an issue of his recent public silence. Biden said through his lawyer Sunday that will step down from his position as a board director of a Chinese company this month and promised not to do any work for foreign firms if his father, Joe Biden, is elected president.\n\nThe former vice president has stood by his son and said he would be a part of his presidential campaign.\n\n6:45 a.m. Trump renews call to disclose whistleblower\u2019s identify\n\nTrump on Monday renewed his call to unmask the whistleblower and seized on comments by Schiff suggesting that House Democrats may not press the anonymous U.S. intelligence official to testify in person before Congress.\n\nIn morning tweets, Trump also continued to insist that the whistleblower did not accurately describe the phone call in which Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens at a time when the United States had withheld military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, the whistleblower\u2019s account closely tracks a rough transcript of the call released by the White House.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff now doesn\u2019t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower\u2019s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA.\u201d\n\nSchiff, who had originally suggested it was important for the whistleblower to provide closed-door testimony, backed off that stance during an appearance Sunday on CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven that we already have the call record, we don\u2019t need the whistleblower who wasn\u2019t on the call to tell us what took place during the call,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe have the best evidence of that.\u201d\n\nIn Monday tweets, Trump also renewed his complaint that Schiff offered an embellished version of the call with Zelensky during a recent hearing. Schiff said that he remarks were intended to be in part parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\n\u201cDemocrat\u2019s game was foiled when we caught Schiff fraudulently making up my Ukraine conversation, when I released the exact conversation Transcript,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nWhite House officials have described what was released as a rough transcript, not a word-for-word recounting of what was said.\n\n6:30 a.m.: Cheney says impeachment a factor in Turkish invasion\n\nCheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, on Monday argued that the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry was a factor in the Turkish invasion of northeastern Syria.\n\nDuring an interview on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Cheney said that abandoning Kurdish fighters allied with the United States would have negative consequences but suggested Democrats were partly to blame for Trump\u2019s announcement that he wouldn\u2019t impede the Turkish invasion.\n\n\u201cI think that what we\u2019re seeing happen is going to have ramifications not just in the Middle East but around the world if our adversaries begin to sense weakness, if our adversaries begin to think we won\u2019t defend our allies, that we won\u2019t defend our interests, that\u2019s provocative,\u201d Cheney said.\n\n\u201cBut I also want to say that the impeachment proceedings that are going on and what the Democrats are doing themselves to try to weaken this president is part of this. There was not an accident that the Turks chose this moment to roll across the border, and I think the Democrats have got to pay very careful attention to the damage they\u2019re doing with the impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: The impeachment crisis shines a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind\n\nHe was hectoring and imperious. He was domineering and defiant. And he was audacious and cavalier.\n\nIn the nearly three weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened an impeachment inquiry, President Trump has struck a posture of raw aggression. His visceral defenses of himself \u2014 at the most vulnerable point of his presidency \u2014 have shined a spotlight on Trump\u2019s state of mind.\n\nLike an aging rock star, the president is now reprising many of the greatest hits from his hellion days. He has bullied and projected \u2014 at times leveling against others the very charges he faces \u2014 while simultaneously depicting himself as a victim. And he has turned to ominous depictions of America, and in moments sounded an authoritarian tone.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "House investigators are hearing from key witnesses in the impeachment probe this week, including the White House\u2019s former top Russia adviser Fiona Hill on Monday.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qyY2EeQRaKTyECWSMw-j3U6rZ2o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/I5WL6PXLVEI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
