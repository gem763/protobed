If you don\u2019t think Trump is capable of getting under her skin, remember that last year he single-handedly convinced her to take a freaking DNA test, the results of which she proudly reported, not-so-accidentally endorsing the \u201cone-drop\u201d theory. Native Americans were, rather understandably, appalled. Everyone else, with the possible exception of Trump himself, was confused. This is not how a sober-minded person responds to jibes from someone who has spent his entire life insulting people.\n\nThe Native American ancestry controversy is not going away, even if Warren does somehow manage to beat the current Super Tuesday math, which still favors Biden. How many Pocahontas jokes do you think she can stomach? Is she ready for Trump to tweet \u201cColors of the Wind\u201d with her face superimposed on the Disney princess character by some teenaged alt-right sludgelord? Is she ready for the rally at which Trump tunelessly declaims \u2014 in that affectless monotone he adopts whenever he is trying to read something \u2014 the lyrics from Cher\u2019s \u201cHalf Breed\u201d? Talking about postal banking in the middle of all this is going to require a very cool head.\n\nThis is to say nothing of questions that we officially do not discuss about the misogyny, unconscious or otherwise, that obviously persists among certain older Democratic voters. Among the small but all-important bloc of voters who went from supporting Barack Obama to Trump, it seems to me not impossible that sex was an important, if largely unacknowledged factor. If you do not think that there is such a thing as a lifelong Democrat who has doubts about a woman\u2019s ability to be commander-in-chief, you have never been on a UAW golf outing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Walther", "Theweek.Com Articles What-Trump-Vs-Warren-Race-Look-Like"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
