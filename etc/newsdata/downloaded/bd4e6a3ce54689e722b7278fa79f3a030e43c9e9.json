A three-judge panel of the Wake County Superior Court ruled Sept. 3 that the district boundaries were unconstitutionally partisan. (Gerry Broome/AP)\n\nA nonprofit organization connected to former Obama attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. is launching a new challenge to partisan gerrymandering in North Carolina, filing a lawsuit in state court seeking to throw out the state\u2019s GOP-drawn congressional districts in time for the 2020 elections.\n\nThe suit, filed Friday by the National Redistricting Foundation, a nonprofit affiliate of a political committee led by Holder, aims to capi\u00adtal\u00adize on a recent state ruling that portions of North Carolina\u2019s state legislative districts are unconstitutionally gerrymandered to maximize Republicans\u2019 advantage.\n\n[Read the lawsuit here]\n\n\u201cFor nearly a decade, the people of North Carolina have been forced to vote on manipulated electoral maps that were drawn by Republicans in the legislature to create a partisan outcome,\u201d Holder said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for this era of gerrymandering in North Carolina to come to an end.\u201d\n\nThe suit quotes a three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court, which wrote that district maps are unconstitutional if they are drawn \u201cwith a predominant intent to favor voters aligned with one political party at the expense of other voters.\u201d\n\nThe suit calls the state\u2019s congressional map \u201cthe most extreme and brazen partisan gerrymander in American history.\u201d It cites the Republican legislative leaders who established \u201cpartisan advantage\u201d as an official criterion and directed that the map be drawn to \u201cmaintain the current partisan makeup of North Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation.\u201d\n\n\n\nJudges Alma L. Hinton, from left, Paul C. Ridgeway and Joseph N. Crosswhite of the Wake County Superior Court listen during opening statements in July in a lawsuit challenging North Carolina legislative districts. On Sept.3, the judges ruled that the boundaries were excessively partisan in aiding Republican candidates. (Gerry Broome/AP)\n\n[Supreme Court rules race improperly dominated N.C. redistricting efforts]\n\nState Rep. David Lewis (R), a defendant and the chairman of the state House redistricting committee, said at the time: \u201cI propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats because I do not believe it\u2019s possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.\u201d\n\nThe map, drawn in 2016, succeeded in that regard, keeping Republicans in control of 10 of the state\u2019s 13 congressional seats in both federal elections since then \u2014 even though Democrats won 47 percent of the overall vote in 2016 and a majority of the vote in 2018.\n\nLewis and several other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nRepublicans drew the current districts after the Supreme Court ruled that the previous map had been unconstitutionally gerrymandered along racial lines.\n\nThe Supreme Court took a different position in July of this year regarding partisan gerrymandering, ruling in another case involving North Carolina\u2019s congressional districts that the federal courts have no jurisdiction in such cases.\n\n[Supreme Court: No role for federal courts in partisan gerrymandering claims]\n\nThat decision redirected the efforts of redistricting reformers, who promised to take their fight to state courts.\n\nThe Sept. 3 ruling on the state legislative map in North Carolina was their first major victory since then, bolstering the hopes of activists who have been pushing for an end to partisan gerrymandering.\n\nOne uncertainty with the latest suit, however, is whether it will wind through court quickly enough to produce new districts in time for the 2020 elections.\n\nThe suit names individual voters from each of the state\u2019s 13 congressional districts as plaintiffs. According to the suit, some live in overwhelmingly \u201cpacked\u201d Democratic districts that ensure that the surrounding districts favor Republicans, while others live in \u201ccracked\u201d communities where Democratic enclaves were divided between two districts to dilute their electoral power.\n\nAmong them is Amy Clare Oseroff, a teacher from Greenville who lives in the 1st Congressional District, into which Republicans packed the most heavily Democratic areas in Pitt and Wilson counties to create an overwhelmingly Democratic district \u2014 leaving the nearby 2nd and 3rd districts more favorable to Republicans.\n\nThe map \u201cmeticulously packs and cracks Democratic voters in each and every district \u2014 without exception,\u201d the suit states.\n\n[Decision on gerrymandering brings new urgency to Democratic fight to win state seats]\n\nThe suit also cites the map\u2019s division of the campus of North Carolina A&T State University in Greensboro \u2014 the largest historically black university in the country. The boundary between the 6th and 13th districts cuts directly through campus, an egregious example of \u201ccracking,\u201d according to the suit. In Asheville, the University of North Carolina is split so dramatically that students living on different sides of the same dormitory live in different congressional districts, according to the suit.\n\nAside from Lewis, the defendants include Republican House Speaker Timothy Moore, Senate President Philip Berger and the State Board of Elections.\n\nThe suit makes numerous references to Thomas Hofeller, a longtime Republican strategist who specialized in drawing district boundaries and who gained attention this year, nearly a year after his death, when his estranged daughter released thousands of files from his business showing the extent to which he and Republicans used race and partisanship to draw boundaries.\n\nThe files also showed that Hofeller was among those who had pushed the Trump administration to seek a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, which he concluded would allow Republicans to exclude noncitizens from apportionment considerations and draw even more dramatically gerrymandered maps.\n\nIn a past lawsuit, Hofeller testified that his goal in North Carolina was to \u201cminimize the number of districts in which Democrats would have an opportunity to elect a Democratic candidate.\u201d He did so, he testified, with a sophisticated analysis of past voting behavior of residents of each district.\n\nHe also did so before the legislative redistricting committees ever met, according to Lewis, who testified in a previous suit that he visited Hofeller\u2019s home numerous times to see the progress of the map.\n\nThe suit argues that the congressional map violates the state constitution\u2019s free elections clause, equal protection clause and freedom of speech and assembly clauses \u2014 exactly the provisions under which the three-judge panel invalidated the state legislative maps three weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThe 2016 congressional map should now meet the same fate as the unconstitutional and invalidated state legislative maps,\u201d the suit states. \u201cThe facts of this case are undisputed, and the law of North Carolina is now settled. This Court should invalidate the gerrymandered 2016 congressional map immediately and order a new, fair map for use in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\nLike the successful suit against the state legislative districts, the suit is being funded by the National Redistricting Foundation, which is the 501(c)(3) affiliate of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.", "description": "A new lawsuit in state court calls congressional districts in North Carolina \u201cthe most extreme and brazen partisan gerrymander in American history.\u201d", "authors": ["Amy Gardner", "National Political Reporter", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N6ss3uDuja8RFXl0ovMRO1o-zMc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q4SRDUXAW4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
