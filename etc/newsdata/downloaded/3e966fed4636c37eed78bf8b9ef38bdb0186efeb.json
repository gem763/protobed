(Image: USA)\n\nAs Mr. Robot draws to its final end, it\u2019s time for Elliot to have a real showdown with the leader of the Dark Army.\n\nA new teaser has dropped for Mr. Robot\u2019s fourth and final season, which sees Elliot and fsociety take the fight to the Chinese hacker group that was once a potential ally in their fight against E Corp. Now with B.D. Wong\u2019s mysterious Whiterose making her own moves, Elliot and his allies find themselves watched and hunted...until Elliot and Whiterose have the chance to sit down and talk one on one.\n\nOr at least this trailer makes it seems like they do. You never know with Mr. Robot!\n\nGiven Elliot\u2019s ongoing struggles between discerning what\u2019s real and what\u2019s imagined, there\u2019s plenty of intriguing flashes in this new teaser as Whiterose starts operating more openly that have us questioning what\u2019s really going on. But, given how close we are to the end of all this conspiratorial hacking in the first place, seeing these two finally come to ahead wouldn\u2019t be all that surprising.\n\nMr. Robot returns one last time starting in the U.S. October 6. Hopefully it hits Fox Showcase or Foxtel Now in Australia not far behind.", "description": "As Mr. Robot draws to its final end, it\u2019s time for Elliot to have a real showdown with the leader of the Dark Army....", "authors": ["David Nield", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/xjmbsriklukeltivuvnr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
