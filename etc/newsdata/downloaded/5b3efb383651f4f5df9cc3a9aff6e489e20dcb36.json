The Oaxacan native, who is also co-owner of James Beard Award-winning restaurant Guelaguetza in Los Angeles, has always been a lover of agave spirits and her latest establishment didn\u2019t disappoint when it started serving drinks last August. There are 500 agave spirits that guests can choose from and while the selection is primarily focused on tequila and mezcal, there are also nearly 20 bottles of rarer Bacanora, sotol and raicilla.\n\nBut perhaps the most impressive thing about Mama Rabbit is that it\u2019s not located in L.A. or New York but right in the middle of Las Vegas in the Park MGM casino. \u201cWe definitely have the biggest tequila and mezcal selection on the Strip, which I\u2019m very, very excited about,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cThere are mezcals that I personally went out of my way to make sure got registered in Nevada and we were the first ones to carry.\u201d\n\nLopez is almost as passionate about salt, which in Oaxaca is traditionally served alongside mezcal with citrus or other slightly acidic fruits\u2014a practice that Mama Rabbit observes with its spirit flights and bottle service. Considering how well mezcal and salt pair on their own, it\u2019s also a natural ingredient for a huge variety of mixed drinks.\n\n\u201cI love salt so much,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cA lot of people underestimate the power of a great rim. It can really change a cocktail tremendously.\u201d\n\nLopez says that Craig Schoettler, corporate mixologist for MGM Resorts who created Mama Rabbit\u2019s drinks, has also been flavoring salts with all kinds of native Oaxacan herbs and spices, including epazote, in order to add even more layers of complexity. Currently, five of the eight agave cocktails on the bar\u2019s menu feature salted rims.\n\nThe Guelaguetza Cocktail (El Silencio Espad\u00edn, lime juice, lime paleta) employs gusano salt, a traditional salt that\u2019s blended with spicy chiles and the dried, flavorful larvae known for feeding on agave plants, while the Salt of the Earth (Los Nahuales Reposado Mezcal, Amontillado sherry, Ancho Reyes Chili Liqueur, bitters) is rimmed with vegetable-infused salt.\n\nHer favorite, however, is the hibiscus salt used to rim the bar\u2019s take on the Paloma, a cocktail traditionally made with tequila and grapefruit soda. The Palomita uses a base of mezcal that\u2019s topped with hibiscus syrup and fresh grapefruit and lime juices. The ingredient that really ties it all together, however, is the hibiscus salt rim.\n\n\u201cThe combination of hibiscus and mezcal\u2014I die,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cI love the Palomita and the way the hibiscus salt complements the smokiness in the mezcal. The hibiscus salt also helps bring out the hints of sweetness in any cocktail.\u201d\n\nEven when she\u2019s not at Mama Rabbit, Lopez says it\u2019s worth the extra step to incorporate a perfectly flavored salt rim into her cocktails.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s nothing that will ever beat having a great Michelada with a great rim and then having a mezcal on the side and slipping in between,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice Saturday evening if I\u2019m watching something on TV or hanging with friends, conversing and having Micheladas and mezcal. It\u2019s one of my favorite things to do on the weekends.\u201d", "description": "We talked to restaurateur Bricia Lopez about her new Las Vegas tequila and mezcal bar, Mama Rabbit, and her undying love of salt.", "authors": ["Anna Archibald"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570565207/191008-Rothbaum-Bricia-Lopez-tease_mxlq5k", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
