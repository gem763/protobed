Lately, it may not have felt like a good time to invest considering the fear over a possible recession, and you might have been tempted to stash your money. Nevertheless, if you are on the lookout for some great stocks on the TSX to buy this September, these are some of the options to consider.\n\nA Canadian bank in America You must have considered TD Bank (TSX:TD)(NYSE:TD) for investment at some point. The company\u2019s dividend yield is 4% compared to the banking industry\u2019s 3.57%, and the dividend has been rising every year for the past two decades. For example, TD\u2019s dividends rose by about 10% in the first quarter of 2019 to $0.74 per share at a payout ratio of 44%. From a dividend stock perspective, TD is already looking quite attractive.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s stock has taken a hit in the past few weeks as have other Canadian bank stocks. From about $77 at the start of August, TD\u2019s stock is now trading at around $72 on the TSX after dropping more than 5% in a month. Investors are understandably worried about a recession, and TD\u2019s U.S. operations had them really worried.\n\nSurprisingly, net income from its U.S. retail segment increased by 11% to contribute to the higher adjusted net income of $3.34 billion, up from $3.13 billion in the same quarter the previous year. Although this was good news, it means that TD derives 40% of its profit from the U.S., and that could indicate possible headwinds ahead.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve may reduce interest rates as many as four times next year, meaning TD\u2019s lending margins may be squeezed. At the same time, these rate cuts may increase loan volumes and credit performance, so it might be a double-edged sword.\n\nThat being said, TD is still a substantial investment being the largest bank by assets ($1.4 trillion) and second-largest by market cap ($131.5 billion). The company\u2019s consistent dividend yield is also a testament to its financial health, and the recent dip in stock price may be just the entry you need to buy this stock cheap.\n\nA fantastic REIT As long as you\u2019re the kind of person that doesn\u2019t mind taking on a bit of risk, Choice Properties (TSX:CHP.UN) should be among your top choices. Choice Properties is a real estate investment trust that currently owns 68 million square feet of gross leaseable area and 756 properties.\n\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2019 ended June 30, Choice Properties\u2019 net income was $238.3 million, up by $559.4 million from a net loss of $312.1 million in the previous fiscal year. The improvement was thanks to a decrease in unit prices, a decline in acquisition transaction costs, and contributions from an acquired REIT.\n\nAlthough weighed down by $2.2 billion in long-term debt, Choice Properties still has excellent financial strength. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 14.14 and price-to-sales ratio of 3.08, this company\u2019s stock is trading below fair value, which means there is an opportunity for you.\n\nSolid energy company Every dividend investor has to have Fortis (TSX:FTS)(NYSE:FTS) in their portfolio to enjoy a 3.3% dividend yield. In the past 40 years, the company has not only been issuing dividends but also raising them each year. Since the start of the year, share prices have risen by over 20%, and future dividend yields through 2023 are expected to rise to 6%.\n\nCompared to Choice Properties, Fortis is the choice for you if you prefer security in your investment over growth in the share price. But remember the company\u2019s P/E ratio currently stands at 15.3, which is higher than the electric utility industry average of 13.8. That is because of net debt that is now 93% of the company\u2019s market cap.\n\nWhich one is the hottest? The choice between these three will come down to your risk appetite, but it is always advisable to diversify and perhaps even invest in all three.\n\nFool contributor Adam Othman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s purpose is to help the world invest, better.
