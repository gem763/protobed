As Lucas Hedges as Shia LaBeouf singing Lana Del Rey asks, \u201cIs it by mistake or design?\u201d This especially odd celebrity trio came together in this glorious deleted scene from Honey Boy (courtesy of director Alma Har\u2019el), where Lucas Hedges plays a young-adult Shia LaBeouf (Shia LaBeouf also stars, playing his own father). LaBeouf famously needs to vibe before he shoots a scene, and Hedges captures that by singing Lana Del Rey\u2019s \u201cBorn to Die\u201d slowly and quietly under his breath, like he is an ASMR YouTube star. To make matters adorable, Hedges brings up the energy to sing the ad-libbed \u201cAll right!\u201d at the end of the verse. No other celebrity combo could possibly be this delicious and intoxicating, unless, of course, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna teamed up for a literal Casamigos Tequila ad. I guess what I\u2019m saying is, I would like a double of this video, no ice, and another one ready to go in just a minute.", "description": "In a deleted scene from \u201cHoney Boy,\u201d Lucas Hedges sings Lana Del Rey as Shia LaBeouf getting into character.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-lucas-hedges-honeyboy.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
