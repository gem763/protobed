Kardashian West saw a video about Johnson, and was so moved by her story that she decided to help.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star personally advocated for a presidential pardon during a visit to the White House in which she and Trump discussed prison reform.\n\nSince then, Kardashian West, who runs a lucrative beauty company, also announced that she is launching a shapewear line next month. Originally called Kimono, she changed the name to SKIMS following accusations of cultural appropriation. In addition to being an entrepreneur and starring in an E! reality show, Kardashian West has announced that she is studying to become a lawyer.\n\n\"I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,\" she told Vogue in April. \"I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
