This could see market interest rates and the euro's exchange rate increase, rather than fall.\n\n\"There is high uncertainty about the extent of the expansionary measures the ECB will implement today; and therefore there is large potential for strong fluctuations in the euro exchange rates,\" Commerzbank's strategists wrote in a note to clients.\n\nThe single currency <EUR=> has fallen 3.5% against the dollar since the ECB began signaling an easing of its monetary policy in June while yields on many euro zone government bonds have set new record lows.\n\nWhile the ECB has a wide range of policy instruments at its disposal, each comes with complications, from questionable efficacy to big side effects.\n\nThe euro zone's biggest troubles - a global trade war, Brexit and China's slowdown - are also outside the central bank's control, suggesting any stimulus would have a limited impact.\n\nStill, the ECB is expected to lower some of its growth and inflation projections, highlighting the broader risk to the economy.\n\nSources told Reuters that the forecasts would predict growth of not much more than 1 percent both this year and next, with underlying and headline inflation rising only modestly.\n\nThe central bank aims for euro zone inflation of just below 2%, a target it has failed to hit since 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n'REINFORCED' POLICY GUIDANCE\n\nA cut in the ECB's minus 0.4% deposit rate - already a record low - appears to be the least contentious move and policymakers will debate a 10 or 20 basis point reduction.\n\nAlthough this would lower short term corporate borrowing costs, it would immediately hit bank profits as negative rates essentially amount to a penalty charge on their more than 1 trillion euros worth of excess reserves.\n\nSo the ECB is likely to exempt banks from part of this charge by introducing a multi-tier deposit rate.\n\nWhile this option would give an immediate boost to banks, critics argue it would only be small and would disproportionately benefit banks in France and Germany.\n\nThe ECB is also expected to push out the timing of any rate hike even further, providing a \"reinforced\" guidance on rates that would tie any move to certain inflation conditions, lowering the emphasis on calendar dates.\n\nThe ECB announces its rate decision at 1145 GMT, followed by Draghi's news conference at 1230 GMT.\n\n\n\n\n\nQE CLASH?\n\nThe most contentious part of the package will be whether to restart bond purchases.\n\nAlthough this is the ECB's most powerful weapon, over half a dozen policymakers, including the central bank chiefs of Germany, France, the Netherlands and Austria have expressed scepticism about the need for it.\n\nThey argue the bloc is merely experiencing a slowdown, not a recession, and such a tool should be reserved for real crises, especially since the ECB has already used up much of its firepower in past rounds of stimulus.\n\nIndeed, rates are at record lows and the ECB's balance sheet is more than a third bigger than the U.S. Federal Reserve's, indicating limited room for more action.\n\nBut with the Fed cutting rates last month and sending some dovish signals about future policy, the ECB can hardly avoid keeping pace to stop the euro from appreciating and further dampening inflation.\n\n\"While we don\u2019t see much room for the ECB to disappoint on rate cuts, forward guidance and tiering, we think the Governing Council may be less dovish than what is priced in by delivering a less generous asset purchase program,\" Nomura said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The European Central Bank is set to unveil fresh stimulus measures on Thursday to prop up the ailing euro zone economy, but its exact moves are far from certain and a decision that underwhelms markets risks pushing up borrowing costs.
