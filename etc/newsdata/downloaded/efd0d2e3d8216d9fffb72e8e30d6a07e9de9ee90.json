Northern Ireland would also be part of any trade deals the UK signed with other countries.\n\nMr Johnson is almost certain to need the DUP\u2019s ten votes in the House of Commons to get any deal through parliament, and a number of Tory Eurosceptics are likely to take their lead from the Northern Irish party.\n\nBut Mr Dodds told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: \u201cNorthern Ireland must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIt cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
