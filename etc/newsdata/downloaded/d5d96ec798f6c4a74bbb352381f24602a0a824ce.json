Would it be minimum wage laws, which deprive low-skilled workers of a chance for employment and upward mobility? Would it be class-warfare tax rates that generate large amounts of economic damage compared to potential (if any) revenue?\n\nThose are tempting choices, but there\u2019s a strong case that nothing is as foolish as rent control.\n\nHere\u2019s a map showing which states impose or allow this destructive form of intervention.\n\nCalifornia politicians are very susceptible to bad ideas.\n\nTrue to form, as reported by the New York Times, they actually want to impose statewide rent control.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers approved a statewide rent cap on Wednesday covering millions of tenants, the biggest step yet in a surge of initiatives to address an affordable-housing crunch nationwide. The bill limits annual rent increases to 5 percent after inflation and offers new barriers to eviction\u2026 a momentous political swing. For a quarter-century, California law has sharply curbed the ability of localities to impose rent control. Now, the state itself has taken that step. \u2026Economists from both the left and the right have a well-established aversion to rent control, arguing that such policies ignore the message of rising prices, which is to build more housing. Studies in San Francisco and elsewhere show that price caps often prompt landlords to abandon the rental business by converting their units to owner-occupied homes. And since rent controls typically have no income threshold, they have been faulted for benefiting high-income tenants.\n\nI\u2019m glad the article included the evidence from economists, especially since the headline is grossly inaccurate. If we care about evidence, it\u2019s far more accurate to say that rent control will exacerbate the state\u2019s housing problems.\n\nWhich is why the Wall Street Journal opined that this type of intervention is especially destructive.\n\nCalifornia already boasts the highest housing costs in the country, and even liberals have come around to acknowledging that not enough homes are built to meet demand. The state has added about half as many housing units as needed to accommodate population growth, and more than half of Californians spend 30% of their income on rent.Blame a thousand regulatory burdens. Local governments limit what housing developers can build and where. They layer on permitting fees, and then there are the state\u2019s high labor costs and expensive green-energy mandates and restrictions that opponents can exploit to block projects for years. \u2026The upshot is that an \u201caffordable\u201d housing unit in California costs $332,000 to build and nearly $600,000 in San Francisco, according to state budget figures. Developers can\u2019t turn a profit on low- and middle-income homes\u2026 And now Democrats want to constrain housing prices by fiat. Mr. Newsom and Democratic legislators are pushing a law to limit annual rent increases across the state to 5% plus inflation. \u2026Building permits in the first seven months this year have fallen 17% compared to 2018 despite an increase in state subsidies. \u2026California\u2019s progressive regulatory complex is contributing to this housing slowdown by driving businesses and people from the state. More than 700,000 residents have left since 2010.\n\nBy the way, the politicians in Albany already made the same mistake.\n\nAnd, as you might expect, the Wall Street Journal\u2018s editorial page had the correct response.\n\nLaw by law, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Democrats are chipping away at the policies that made New York City livable after decades of decline\u2026 Democrats this week are ramming through rent-control bills that\u2026effectively dictates rents for one million or so rent-regulated apartments and restricts landlords\u2019 ability to evict tenants who don\u2019t pay. \u2026Once a tenant moves out\u2014which doesn\u2019t happen often since folks can pass on the entitlement to friends and relatives\u2014landlords would be required to offer the unit to another tenant at restricted rates. \u2026Nor could they raise rates by more than 2% annually to pay for improvements or evict a nonpaying tenant who \u201ccannot find a similar suitable dwelling in the same neighborhood.\u201d Since landlords would have less incentive to make fixes, more apartments will deteriorate and come to resemble New York City\u2019s squalid public housing. \u2026One result will be less housing investment\u2026 Progressives are vindicating CEO Jeff Bezos \u2019s decision to pull Amazon\u2019s second headquarters out of New York. Don\u2019t be surprised if other businesses follow.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn that politicians in other nations sometimes make the same mistake.\n\nThe U.K.-based Guardian wrote about how rent control has backfired in Sweden.\n\nHalf a million are on the waiting list for rent-controlled flats in Stockholm, meaning a two-tier system, bribes and a thriving parallel market\u2026 the system is experiencing acute pressures. Building of rental homes almost dried up after a financial crisis in the early 1990s, and there is a dire shortage of properties. Demand is such that it is almost impossible to get a direct contract. With nearly half of all Stockholmers \u2013 about 500,000 people \u2013 in the queue, it can take 20 or 30 years to get to the top of the pile. \u2026The result is a thriving rental property black market, with bribes of as much as 100,000 kronor per room to obtain a direct contract, McCormac says. Many people sublet space in their rental apartments. \u2026\u201cRent controls were supposed to enable people to live in central locations, but now it is having the opposite effect,\u201d McCormac says. \u201cPeople without social connections will have a very hard time finding a flat,\u201d says Kleberg.\n\nAnd Germany is making the same mistake \u2013 even though it should have learned from the mistakes under Hitler\u2019s national socialism and East Germany\u2019s communism.\n\n\u2026the kinds of ideas traditionally associated with planned economies are gaining more and more support all over Germany. \u2026Substantial numbers of people have moved to Germany\u2019s major cities\u2026the supply of housing has failed to keep pace with these significant developments, and this is largely because construction approval processes are so long-winded and the latest environmental regulations have made building prohibitively expensive. \u2026In Germany\u2019s capital, Berlin, \u2026it now takes 12 years to draft and approve a zoning plan, which in many cases is a prerequisite for the development of new dwellings. \u2026An initiative in Berlin calling for the expropriation of private real estate companies has collected three times as many signatures as it needed to initiate a petition for a referendum. \u2026Kevin K\u00fchnert, chairman of the youth organization of the center-left SPD\u2026has gone as far as calling for a complete ban on private property owners renting out their apartments. \u2026Berlin\u2019s Senate approved the main components of a rent freeze in the German capital. \u2026Advocates of such central economic planning react sensitively when they are reminded that it has already been tried\u2026 An earlier rent freeze was approved in Germany on April 20, 1936, as a gift from the National Socialist Party to the citizens of Germany on Adolf Hitler\u2019s 47th birthday. The National Socialists\u2019 rent cap was adopted into the GDR\u2019s socialist law by Price Regulation No. 415 of May 6, 1955, and it remained in force until the collapse of the GDR in 1989.\n\nNow let\u2019s review some economic research.\n\nThree Stanford professors researched the issue, looking specifically as San Francisco\u2019s local rent control rules.\n\nUsing a 1994 law change, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in the assignment of rent control in San Francisco to study its impacts on tenants and landlords. Leveraging new data tracking individuals\u2019 migration, we find rent control limits renters\u2019 mobility by 20% and lowers displacement from San Francisco. Landlords treated by rent control reduce rental housing supplies by 15% by selling to owner-occupants and redeveloping buildings. Thus, while rent control prevents displacement of incumbent renters in the short run, the lost rental housing supply likely drove up market rents in the long run, ultimately undermining the goals of the law. \u2026In the long run, landlords\u2019 substitution toward owner-occupied and newly constructed rental housing not only lowered the supply of rental housing in the city, but also shifted the city\u2019s housing supply towards less affordable types of housing that likely cater to the tastes of higher income individuals. Ultimately, these endogenous shifts in the housing supply likely drove up citywide rents, damaging housing affordability for future renters\u2026it appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy\u2019s intended goal. \u2026rent control has contributed to widening income inequality of the city.\n\nTo be fair, rent control is just one of several bad policies that mess up the city\u2019s housing market.\n\nNow let\u2019s shift to the other side of the country.\n\nJeff Jacoby of the Boston Globe shared evidence from a disastrous experiment in Massachusetts.\n\n\u2026a handful of Democratic lawmakers want to bring the horror of rent control\u2026 This isn\u2019t happening only in Massachusetts. \u2026Oregon\u2019s governor just signed a statewide rent-control law and efforts to overturn rent-control bans are underway in Illinois, Colorado, and Washington state. \u2026the folly of rent control is so well-established that to deny it requires, as Hillary Clinton might say, a willing suspension of disbelief. Massachusetts and most other states have banned rent control because the harm it causes far outweighs any benefit it confers. When politicians impose a ceiling on rent, the results are invariable: housing shortages, depressed real estate values, increased decay, less new construction. \u2026The longer rent control persists, and the more harshly it is enforced, the worse the problem grows. \u2026in New York City, where strict rent controls date back to World War II, the annual rate at which apartments turn over is less than half the national average, while the share of tenants who haven\u2019t moved in more than 20 years is more than double the national average. \u2026Acknowledging the damage caused by rent control is neither a right- nor left-wing issue. \u2026the communist foreign minister of Vietnam\u2026made\u2026the\u2026point in 1989: \u201cThe Americans couldn\u2019t destroy Hanoi,\u201d Nguyen Co Thach remarked, \u201cbut we have destroyed our city by very low rents.\u201d \u2026When Massachusetts voters struck down rent control in 1994, it was in the teeth of preposterous fearmongering by hardline tenant activists\u2026 What happened in reality was that tens of thousands of apartments were decontrolled with no ill effects\u2026 When tenants were analyzed by occupation, it was high-earning professionals and managers who predominated among the beneficiaries of rent control; semi-skilled and unskilled workers lagged far behind. Rent control always ends up benefiting the young, strong, and well-to-do at the expense of the old, weak, and poor.\n\nMeanwhile, Meghan McArdle opined in the Washington Post about the perverse economic consequences of rent control.\n\n\u2026there are a few questions where there\u2019s near unanimity, and rent control is one of them. Pretty much every economist agrees that rent controls are bad. \u2026the policy appears to be making a comeback. \u2026City governments may have to relearn why their predecessors pruned back rent-control policies. Rent control is supposed to protect poor, deserving tenants from the depredations of greedy landlords. And it does, up to a point. \u2026The problem is that rent control doesn\u2019t do anything about the reason that rents are rising, which is that there are more people who want to live in desirable areas than there are homes for them to live in. Housing follows the same basic laws of economics as other goods that consumers need\u2026 rent control also reduces the incentive to supply rental housing. \u2026an actual solution to skyrocketing rents: Build more housing, so that the rent controls won\u2019t be necessary\u2026 To do that, cities would need to ease the costly land-use regulations that make it so difficult for developers to fill the unmet demand. \u2026Alas, that\u2019s not going to happen\u2026 Declining housing stock is just one of the many potential costs of rent controls; others include a deteriorating housing stock as landlords stop investing in their properties, and higher rents. Yes, higher, because rent control creates a two-tier housing market. There are cheap, price-stabilized apartments that rarely turn over, because why would you give up such a great deal? Then there are the uncontrolled apartments, which everyone else in the city has to fight over, bidding up the price. \u2026the people getting the biggest benefit are white, affluent Manhattanites.\n\nBy the way, you hopefully have noticed a pattern.\n\nRich people generally get the biggest benefits under rent control.\n\nLet\u2019s close with a look at how economists from across the philosophical spectrum view rent control\n\nHere\u2019s some survey data from the University of Chicago.\n\nIncidentally, there\u2019s an obvious reason why politicians persist in pushing bad policy. In the case of rent control, it\u2019s because tenants outnumber landlords.\n\nSo even if politicians understand that the policy will backfire, their desire to get votes will trump common sense. Especially if they assume they can blame \u201cgreedy landlords\u201d for the inevitable housing shortages and then push for government housing subsidies as an ostensible solution.\n\nAnother example of Mitchell\u2019s Law.", "description": "Identifying the worst government policy would be a challenge.
