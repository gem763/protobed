REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nDraghi, who will step down at the end of the month, was likely taking aim at critics of the ECB\u2019s easy policy in cash-rich countries such as Germany, where the government is still running a budget surplus despite a stagnating economy.\n\nThe ECB has become engulfed in its biggest public spat in years after Draghi forced through a resumption of the bank\u2019s 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying program last month despite opposition from more than a third of its Governing Council.\n\n\u201cA more active fiscal policy in the euro area would thus make it possible to adjust our policies more quickly, which we are well aware are having adverse effects on certain sectors of society and certain intermediaries,\u201d Draghi told an event in Milan.\n\nEuro zone governments also called this week on Germany and the Netherlands to invest more but were rebuffed by the German and Dutch finance ministers.\n\nDraghi also took a swing at eurosceptics, who fell way short of a majority at the last European elections and have also lost some support in Draghi\u2019s native Italy since the right-wing League party left government in the summer.\n\n\u201cIt is now the \u2018doubters\u2019 that are being doubted,\u201d Draghi said.\n\nHe defended the ECB\u2019s role in the Greek debt crisis of 2015, when it froze a cash lifeline for the country\u2019s banks - forcing the government to introduce capital controls and weakening its negotiating positions with creditors.\n\nThe actions of European authorities in Greece have been criticized by the then finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in a book that was recently turned into a movie and screened at the ECB this week.\n\n\u201cThe ECB stayed within the confines of its mandate,\u201d Draghi said. \u201cUltimately, it was an approach that worked for both Greece and Europe, although the price paid by the Greek people was high.\u201d", "description": "Euro zone governments can help the European Central Bank raise interest rates sooner if they loosen their own purse strings to support the economy, ECB President Mario Draghi said on Friday.", "authors": ["Giulio Piovaccari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439674655&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A147", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
