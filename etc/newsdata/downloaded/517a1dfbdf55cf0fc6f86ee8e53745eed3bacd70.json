Citing a quote attributed to Winston Churchill, Cooperman argued that \"you don't make poor people rich by making rich people poor.\"\n\n\"I believe in a progressive income-tax structure. I believe rich people should pay more; I have no problem with that. This wealth tax is baloney,\" Cooperman said.\n\n\"What is their problem with billionaires?\" he added.\n\nBoth candidates have criticized billionaires and put forth policy plans for a wealth tax to raise funds for a variety of new government programs.\n\nWarren's proposal includes a 2% tax on families with a net worth of $50 million to $1 billion and a 3% tax on households worth north of $3 billion. Sanders' plan has a scaling tax reaching as high as 8% for people worth more than $10 billion.\n\nCooperman also said the decade-long bull market had \"one more leg left\" and could rise by 10% over the next six months.\n\nRead more: BANK OF AMERICA: One of the most trusted defenses against stock-market crashes is on the brink of its demise.
