Shape Created with Sketch. 11 of Meghan Markle's best feminist quotes 1/11 On stigma around menstruation and female education 'Imagine a world where the female leaders we revere never achieved their full potential because they dropped out of school at the age of thirteen. In the western world this is challenging to fathom, but for millions of young women globally, this remains their harsh reality for a staggering reason. From sub-Saharan Africa to India, Iran, and several other countries, the stigma surrounding menstruation and lack of access to proper sanitation directly inhibit young women from pursuing an education.' (Time, 2017) Getty Images 2/11 On the #MeToo and Time's Up movements 'I hear a lot of people saying when speaking about girls\u2019 empowerment, finding and knowing their worth, or women\u2019s empowerment as well, you will often hear people say: \"You\u2019re helping women find their voices.\" And I fundamentally disagree with that, because women don\u2019t need to find the voice \u2013 they have a voice, they need to be empowered to use it and people need to be encouraged to listen. And I think right now in the climate that we\u2019re seeing with so many campaigns, with #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, there is no better time than to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people really helping to support them, men included in that.' (The Royal Foundation Forum, 2018) Getty Images 3/11 On gender stereotypes in cleaning adverts 'I don\u2019t think it is right for kids to grow up thinking these things, that just mum does everything.' (At 11 years old on Nick News, 1993) Getty Images 4/11 On supporting women's voices 'Women make up more than half of the world\u2019s population and potential, so it is neither just nor practical for their voices, for our voices, to go unheard at the highest levels of decision-making. The way that we change that, in my opinion, is to mobilize girls and women to see their value as leaders, and to support them in these efforts.' (UN Women Conference, 2015) Getty Images 5/11 On women's suffrage 'Women\u2019s suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness. Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote, but also about what that represents: the basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community.' (At Government House in New Zealand for 125th anniversary of women achieving right to vote in country, 2018) Getty Images 6/11 On dressing like a feminist 'You don\u2019t have to play dress up to be a feminist. You are a feminist exactly the way you are. You can be a woman who wants to look good and still stand up for the equality of women. There\u2019s no uniform for feminism; you are a feminist exactly the way you are.' (Create and Cultivate, 2016) Getty Images 7/11 On knowing your value 'I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value.' (InStyle, 2015) Getty Images 8/11 On taking action to achieve equality 'It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision \u2013 because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together. Starting now.' (UN Women Conference, 2015) Getty Images 9/11 On looking after yourself 'Be kind to yourself. Truly, if we treated ourselves as well as we treated our best friends we would be a million miles ahead of the game. There\u2019s this great Georgia O\u2019Keefe quote that resonates with me: \u201cI have already settled it for myself so flattery and criticism go down the same drain, and I am quite free.\"' Getty Images 10/11 On breaking glass ceilings 'With fame comes opportunity, but it also includes responsibility \u2013 to advocate and share, to focus less on glass slippers and more on pushing through glass ceilings. And, if I'm lucky enough, to inspire.' (Elle, 2016) Getty Images 11/11 On what it means to be a feminist \u2018No matter what you look like, you should be taken seriously. I think it\u2019s really great to be able to be a feminist, and be feminine. To embrace both.\u2019 (Interview with Larry King, 2016) 1/11 On stigma around menstruation and female education 'Imagine a world where the female leaders we revere never achieved their full potential because they dropped out of school at the age of thirteen.
