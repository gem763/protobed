Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo\n\nLeonard fittingly arrived well after any other players, just as he had last June when he lifted the NBA Finals trophy with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThis time, Leonard got the best of a juicy matchup against LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the cross town Lakers, scoring 30 points to guide the Clippers to a 112-102 victory.\n\nWith respect to James and his well-earned \u201cKing\u201d moniker, Leonard reminded that it is he who currently wears the league\u2019s crown.\n\nFor the two-time NBA champion, dominating has become business as usual.\n\n\u201cThis is my ninth year in the NBA. I\u2019ve been leading teams for about four, five, six years. It\u2019s the same game,\u201d Leonard told reporters.\n\n\u201cIt was just different for me tonight because I\u2019ve got a different coach, different play calls, different defensive structures. Other than that, it\u2019s just basketball.\u201d\n\nIt certainly felt like much more than \u2018just basketball\u2019 at the Staples Center where two title contenders, and their opposing fans, are positioning for elbow room.\n\nLakers coach Frank Vogel pointed to the throng of media that awaited him before the game and acknowledged: \u201cThis feels different than a regular season game.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt definitely felt bigger,\u201d Clippers Croatian center Ivica Zubac told Reuters. \u201cYou have two teams that are going to compete for a championship and the fans were really into it.\u201d\n\nThe game was officially recorded as a Clippers \u201chome\u201d game but you couldn\u2019t tell from the swarm of Lakers supporters.\n\nLeonard was booed when he grabbed a microphone before tip-off to thank attendees for coming out.\n\nHe responded by scoring 16 points in the second quarter where he dueled with James as they guarded each other for stretches.\n\nIt was a high-level glimpse into future matchups between the two players; James attacked the rim with downhill fury while Leonard calmly pumped in pull up jump shots over each shoulder to give the Clippers control.\n\n\u201cHe created the run for us and everyone else joined in,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what he does, he talks with his game.\u201d\n\nTOUGH YET UNDERSTATED\n\nThe Clippers were already a defensive team that pushed into the playoffs without a talisman last season; with Leonard, they have the ability to stonewall opposing offenses.\n\nIt is easy to see what attracted Leonard to the tough yet understated Clippers when he left Toronto this off-season and passed on creating a super team with James and Davis on the Lakers. The team feels built in his image.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a dynamic player on both ends of the court,\u201d Clippers Montrezl Harrell said. \u201cTo be able to (play with and) get a feel for him, it felt great.\u201d\n\nThe Clippers are not even at full strength yet as All Star Paul George is expected to join them sometime next month following shoulder surgeries.\n\nStill, the Lakers are not conceding ultimate defeat after just one game.\n\n\u201cI disagree on how big of a test it was. It\u2019s the first game,\u201d James said. \u201cObviously, the NBA is back and everyone is trying to have the narrative of a rivalry game and it\u2019s a huge test. Both teams are not who they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve.\u201d", "description": "More than an hour after Tuesday's season-opening showdown between the NBA's two Los Angeles teams, a crammed room of reporters awaited the man of the hour \u2013 new Clippers star KawhiLeonard.", "authors": ["Jahmal Corner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444199915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1QO-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
