I'm sure there will be more posts on the inanity of the climate change (formerly known as global warming until a few predictions made by Al Gore didn't pan out) rally that shut down Washington, D.C. The protesters forced thousands of drivers to sit in traffic as they littered and danced throughout the streets of D.C. But was the protest truly about saving the planet? No, as pointed out by acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli, the lefties really just want to destroy capitalism. In fact, they are pretty honest in their goal.\n\n\"As you can see from the picture that I took of the so-called global warming protesters outside of my office, what they are really against is capitalism and freedom. I would also note, that the police seem to be helping them more than anything,\" Cuccinelli tweeted from his Washington, D.C. office.\n\nAs you can see from the picture that I took of the so-called global warming protesters outside of my office, what they are really against is capitalism and freedom.

Yeah, neither can I. This looks like a form of passive support by the police,\" he added.\n\nCan you imagine any protest about any issue that is right of center where the police in Washington DC would just let you stop up traffic all over the city?

These leftists' ultimate goal is massive economic change of socialism ushered in on the coattails of climate anxiety. It is all a bogus effort by the left to destroy capitalism. Don't take my word for it, listen to the architect of the Green New Deal's reasoning.", "description": ".09/23/2019 13:18:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/11/e242da08-cd9b-4227-8a90-0e3c2d5aa8b2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
