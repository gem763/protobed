Keep in mind that the whistleblower wasn\u2019t on the call either and got all of his or herhttps://twitter.com/El__Bohemio/status/1177334829785989120 information second- or third-hand.\n\nIs this implying that the leaker was fed bad intel or is the concocted story all BS? \u2014 Ed Oxbow (@Carmard) September 26, 2019\n\nOh look, the whistleblower complaint contained lies: https://t.co/UNOQNGvN6T \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) September 26, 2019\n\nFraud whistleblower couldn't even get THIS DETAIL CORRECT. So much for MASSIVELY DETAILED. https://t.co/7eixGYByVf \u2014 RealTalK (@SmallAxe2016) September 26, 2019\n\nOh. Well, that doesn't seem right. Does that mean it's a lie? How can we believe any of these claims now? https://t.co/CrJbzABKBE \u2014 English Fox (@lonefoxgeezer) September 26, 2019\n\nFirst direct pushback here against the accuracy of the memo (other than discrepancies between the readout & its description), but is anyone on the record on this? https://t.co/bkzHjj8s6H \u2014 Dan McLaughlin (@baseballcrank) September 26, 2019\n\nMike Rogers just said how the IC didn't really investigate the allegations, that the Democrats are too confident. https://t.co/gMKujKNV6j \u2014 Langdale.ca (@laangled) September 26, 2019\n\nIf you're going to the mat on accusing the President of an impeachable offense, you damn well better not make one single slip up. https://t.co/sFu61lY5np \u2014 J.J. by the Bay (@flagg_colonel) September 26, 2019\n\nUh oh\u2026its falling apart already. https://t.co/1DwARmX1a9 \u2014 Chris M (@cmultrading) September 26, 2019\n\nReminder that the whistleblower did not hear the conversation, and their recollection was a recollection from someone else. That was the problem with treating the complaint as sacrosanct https://t.co/q870YGq1TX \u2014 Kevin Tierney (@CatholicSmark) September 26, 2019\n\nLooks like Adam Schiff is a worse writer than Ben Rhodes, fellas, if you are going to do grand narratives, you need to get your characters straight! https://t.co/kLwMfEzqxj \u2014 JRB (@jrbflyersfan) September 26, 2019\n\nwell shit \u2013 looks like the \"whistleblower\" was *FED* bad intel \u2026\u2026\u2026.. https://t.co/kgwu7rfpgO \u2014 Federal Spy Guy (@FederalSpyGuy) September 26, 2019\n\nits already falling apart, cupcake. This is now the second lie, the first one belongs to Schiff. https://t.co/JiWqTTbdxQ \u2014 Jerry Fletcher (@guntotingteabag) September 26, 2019\n\nCant even get the details right. But for sure he knows what happened on that call https://t.co/VkckCLsToB \u2014 SpiffTheSpaceMan (@SpiffDSpaceman) September 26, 2019\n\nIs there such a thing as 4th hand knowledge? \u2014 Kevin Wells (@Luckydogguy) September 26, 2019\n\nThis is eerily reminiscent of the Steele dossier in which Michael Cohen was said to be in Prague when Cohen had never been to Prague. https://t.co/9kkTFmQs3s \u2014 Rising serpent (@rising_serpent) September 26, 2019\n\nAnother day, another anti-Trump story revealed as Fake News. https://t.co/xZhGe9Qyno \u2014 Billy Swagspeare (@bswagspeare) September 26, 2019\n\nSEEMS KIND OF IMPORTANT https://t.co/UZksbd0SVM \u2014 Abraham Woodhull (@politiwars) September 26, 2019\n\nhttps://t.co/S92DMxzxNa The name of the state department official in the complaint? That official wasn't one of the group listening in, unlike what the whistleblower claimed. This official was the ONE NAMED WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL in the entire document, as I noted. Leak marker. \u2014 Kyle (@HNIJohnMiller) September 26, 2019\n\nI am beginning to think this was to smoke out leakers\u2026 https://t.co/qhQCdVjeqQ \u2014 HSJC Sister\ud83d\ude81\u274c (@Peaches_Sabrina) September 26, 2019\n\nNeed to ask this leaker if he wrote the whole complaint? This is very stinky indeed. \u2014 UKForUSA (@UKForUSA) September 26, 2019\n\nSo now that question becomes; who leaked the confidential call? These conversations are classified. Should be relatively easy to identify the leaker and prosecute them under the espionage act. \u2014 Ricky Moser (@truckinforu) September 26, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Just how far removed from the actual phone call was the whistleblower to get this wrong?", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-21-at-6.03.05-PM.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
