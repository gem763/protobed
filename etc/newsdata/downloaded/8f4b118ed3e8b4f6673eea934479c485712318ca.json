(Mark Bochsler/CBC)\n\nShe also said that there are \"always two sides\" in court cases like these and that the three teens who pleaded guilty have never faced criminal charges until now.\n\n\"They're really good kids. They made mistakes, and they're taking responsibility for those mistakes,\" she said.\n\nPolice launched an investigation last fall after a video that captured a sexual assault on the school's campus was shared on social media.\n\nAccording to the agreed statement of facts, the first incident happened on Sept. 18, 2018, when St. Michael's junior football team was in the locker room of the school's basement.\n\nOne boy was changing his clothes at his locker when he was surrounded by several people and \"picked up by the arms and legs and swung around,\" the court documents said.\n\nThe group then put him on the floor and pulled down his football pants.\n\n'Get the broom!'\n\n\"People started yelling, 'Get the broom!' Then someone struck him hard on the buttocks with an object several times,\" the agreed statement of facts said.\n\nThings escalated on Oct. 17, 2018, when the same victim went to the locker room with the team to change.\n\nHe heard a \"roar from his teammates,\" then turned and saw a group of people approaching him.\n\n\"He tried to run. Someone tripped him, and he went down to the floor on his knees,\" the court documents said.\n\nOne other teen\u2019s charges are still making their way through the court system. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\nHis pants were then pulled down, and he was smacked on the buttocks before being held down and assaulted with the broom.\n\n\"The broom was shoved into his buttocks and anus several times,\" the court documents said.\n\nA third incident occurred on Nov. 7, 2018, after the team had won a championship football game.\n\nThat time, a second victim was held down on the locker room floor by a group of students who tore at his clothing, ripping his underwear apart, the documents say.\n\nAgain, the victim was anally penetrated with a broom handle, the agreed statement of facts said.\n\n\"All the while [the boy] struggled against them and yelled at him to stop.\"\n\nInvestigation touched off national discussion\n\nDefence lawyer Jeff Mazin, who represented another one of the teens, told reporters that in pleading guilty, his client spared the victims from having to testify about the assaults.\n\n\"Responsibility has been taken,\" he said.\n\nOverall, seven students were charged with assault and sexual assault offences that related to these incidents.\n\nFour of the students charged were expelled and three withdrew from the school in the wake of the allegations.\n\nCharges against one of those seven were withdrawn back in August after a prosecutor said a conviction was unlikely.\n\nThe cases against two other students also concluded that month, but Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General would not say what the outcomes of the cases against the teens were, citing restrictions under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.\n\nOne other teen's charges are still making their way through the court system. A hearing has been scheduled for Oct. 17.\n\nSt. Michael's is run by the Basilian Fathers with its roots dating back to the Congregation of St. Basil in France. The school's principal and its board president resigned amid criticism of its handling of the case.\n\nThe investigation touched off a national discussion about bullying and hazing in Canadian schools. Many alumni came forward with their own stories of abuse at the Catholic school, while others spoke about their positive memories of the institution.\n\nAn independent committee set up to examine the culture at St. Michael's found that bullying remained a \"systemic\" problem despite extensive measures taken by the school in the wake of the scandal. It also found that hazing was not a problem.\n\nThe committee issued a 123-page report in August that offered 36 recommendations, including developing a comprehensive strategy to address bullying and robust staff training to deal with the issue. The school promised to adopt all the recommendations.\n\nadam.carter@cbc.ca", "description": "Three former students of\u00a0St.\u00a0Michael's College School in Toronto have\u00a0pleaded guilty to\u00a0sexual assault offences\u00a0in\u00a0hazing incidents that occurred at the private, Catholic boys school.", "authors": ["Adam Carter Is A Newfoundlander Who Now Calls Toronto Home.
