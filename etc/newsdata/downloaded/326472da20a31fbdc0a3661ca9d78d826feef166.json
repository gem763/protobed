It closed 34 GM plants across the US, forced suppliers to idle workers and disrupted operations in Mexico and Canada. Union members have been getting by on $275 a week in strike pay during the longest strike against GM since 1970. Some will return to work as soon as Saturday.\n\nWhile a majority voted to ratify, some said they were dissatisfied with the outcome. A worker speaking on the condition of anonymity said he felt the return on six weeks of striking \u201cwasn\u2019t worth it \u2026 because GM is still sticking it to the little guy \u2013 just in a fancier way\u201d.\n\nHe questioned why the union agreed to close three plants and called the contract \u201cvague\u201d in key areas. He said the deal does not guarantee full-time employment for many temporary workers, and that language on job security is unclear. While GM plans to invest $3b in its Detroit-Hamtramck plant, which had been scheduled to close, the employee noted that the contract does not spell out when retooling will start or how many employees will run the plant.\n\nHe said: \u201cI thought this strike was going to be revolutionary, a history-maker, because that\u2019s the feeling I had when we walked out. I thought America was due for a revolution and our strike was going to be it.\u201d\n\nTerry Dittes, UAW vice-president and the director of the UAW-GM department, said: \u201cGeneral Motors members have spoken. We are all so incredibly proud of UAW-GM members who captured the hearts and minds of a nation. Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working-class Americans.\u201d\n\nEmployees receiving lower pay have said they see fewer wins in the proposed deal and have largely voted against it. And those in plants slated for closure also opposed it in large numbers.\n\nThe strike came as UAW and GM argued over pay, healthcare benefits, the treatment of temporary workers, the closure of car plants and GM\u2019s use of foreign manufacturers. The union stressed that its members made sacrifices as the company struggled during the recession. GM has pulled in over $25bn in profits over the last two and a half years, and workers said they were striking for a fair share of the company\u2019s hefty returns.\n\nThe four-year deal \u2013 which will serve as a model as the UAW negotiates contracts with Ford and Fiat-Chrysler \u2013 includes 3% base wage increases during years two and four, and an $11,000 bonus upon ratification for full-time employees. Temporary workers will receive $4,500. Under the proposal, GM will invest $7.7bn in US factories, Detroit\u2019s Hamtramck plant will be saved from closure, and temporary workers will be given a path to permanent employment.\n\nBut GM\u2019s plant in Lordstown, Ohio will remain closed, as will plants in Baltimore and Warren, Michigan. GM has made no commitment to keep jobs in the US and will continue to build up production in Mexico.", "description": "The longest strike by autoworkers in a decade came to an end on Friday as United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new deal with General Motors.
