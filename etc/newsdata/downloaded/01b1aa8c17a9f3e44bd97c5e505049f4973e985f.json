Chris Murphy Christopher (Chris) Scott MurphyThe Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Trump has had a rough October Pelosi, Schumer hit 'flailing' Trump over 'sham ceasefire' deal Romney slams ceasefire deal, calls Trump's Syria move 'a bloodstain' in US history MORE (D-Conn.) said.\n\nJeffrey was testifying at the first of three hearings scheduled this week on Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from Syria and Turkey\u2019s subsequent military offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision has been widely criticized in Congress as leaving the Kurds to be slaughtered by Turkey. Ankara considers the Kurds terrorists connected to a Turkish Kurdish insurgency, but the United States relied on the Kurds to be the ground force in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing was happening as a five-day cease-fire negotiated by Vice President Pence with Erdo\u011fan was expiring and as Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinThese 3 women are defining the race to unseat Trump The Russo-Chinese alliance emerges Russia's snub of Geneva Convention protocol sets dangerous precedent MORE reached a deal for Turkey and Russia to jointly control territory near Syria\u2019s border with Turkey.\n\nTrump has defended his decision as fulfilling a campaign promise to end \u201cendless wars,\u201d despite the fact that other U.S. officials have said the troops will stay elsewhere in the region. But lawmakers have said the withdrawal gave the green light for Turkey to invade.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jeffery said Turkey\u2019s offensive was \u201cnot inevitable.\u201d\n\nHe pushed back on senators\u2019 characterization that Trump got \u201crolled\u201d by Erdo\u011fan and that the withdrawal led to Turkey\u2019s invasion.\n\nRomney asked Jeffrey if he was wrong to think that \u201cErdo\u011fan basically said, \u2018We\u2019re coming in. Get out of the way,\u2019 and America blinked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that we got out of the way because we were not militarily in the way,\u201d Jeffrey replied, adding later that Erdo\u011fan's offensive was \u201cabsolutely\u201d unrelated to the withdrawal.\n\nJeffrey\u2019s argument was that Trump\u2019s initial withdrawal was just a couple dozen troops at two outposts that were tasked only with observing whether there was cross-border fire and that the subsequent withdrawal of the rest of the 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria was a \u201cprudent\u201d defensive step after Turkey expanded its offensive.\n\nRomney was unconvinced.\n\n\u201cOur president told President Erdo\u011fan that we would be pulling out our troops. We did so, and they attacked within a matter of hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you say those are unrelated, but it would seem to me there was a relationship.\u201d\n\nPressed later by Murphy about whether U.S. forces were a deterrent to Turkey, Jeffrey said, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our soldiers on the ground were led to believe something fundamentally different,\u201d Murphy shot back. \u201cSo query as to how our soldiers who carried out the mission felt that they were betraying the Kurds if ultimately part of the reason for being there wasn\u2019t to protect them against the very nation on their border that was seeking to destroy them.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Syria and the anti-ISIS coalition said Tuesday he was not consulted on President Trump\u2019s decision this month to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/syriaturkeymilitaryaction_101519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
