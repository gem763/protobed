(Image: Ellie Michalka and Angie Wang, Abrams Books)\n\nThere has long been a joy to the physical capacity of holding a book \u2014 even in this age where we can download a million volumes to our phones and e-readers, there\u2019s just something about the heft of a book in your hands that still feels a little bit like magic. But a new Steven Universe book out today takes that magic a step further, as befitting a saga of magical space rocks.\n\nOn its surface, The Tale of Steven \u2014 penned by Steven Universe mastermind Rebecca Sugar, and with illustrations from Elle Michalka and Angie Wang \u2014 is, perhaps like all good children\u2019s books, deceptively simple. Stunningly gorgeous, yes, but still, simple. It\u2019s a storybook retelling of Steven\u2019s complete journey on the show up to and including \u201cChange Your Mind,\u201d charting Pink Diamond\u2019s escape from the Diamond Authority, the rise of Rose Quartz, and all the way to Steven\u2019s own road to getting White Diamond to accept his existence as a being.\n\nIt\u2019s a very nice book in person. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nBut aside from all the thematic discussion that comes with all that, beneath the surface Tale of Steven is a wonderfully smart commentary on bias and perspective, and how different points of view can all colour and reframe the same story. But it isn\u2019t left to literary subtext to make this point \u2014 this is, after all, a book whose primary audience is not older fans of the show, but its youngest followers. Instead, it does so in a way that... well, weirdly enough, I kind of have to do this before I can tell you, which feels absurd:\n\nBecause Tale of Steven is a physical object that comments on perspective literally.\n\nYou realise this the very moment you open the book, which starts with two things: a page for the owner to personalise the book as their own, and then White Diamond talking to the audience. Except... she\u2019s presented like this.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to cheat and rotate the image yourself. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nShe\u2019s upside down. And instructing that you, dear reader, are simply reading the book wrong. Flip it so White is up the right way, literally physically turn the book upside down in a manner that immediately makes it feel weird and alien, but, that\u2019s supposedly the way to read the book. And so it goes, as White Diamond tells us the story of how a silly little gem like Pink Diamond, against her better\u2019s wishes, chose to rebel and runaway from her duties.\n\nUntil suddenly, the book isn\u2019t that. Pink Diamond enters the narrative herself, and with her point of view, the book itself gains, literally, a new point of view. This time, you\u2019re flipping it so it\u2019s vertical. White Diamond is still telling her own version of the story, so you start repeatedly flipping the book around to read each little bubble.\n\nAnd so, The Tale of Steven goes, adding layer upon layer of perspective. Pink becomes Rose, who has her own point of view and her own way to read the book. Then, when it comes time for Steven to enter the picture, literally, he too has his own view of things, requiring another angle for you to turn the book to to comprehend it.\n\nPage after page, you\u2019re flipping, rotating, reading a single story, told from multiple angles, metatextually and literally. It\u2019s all confusing and more than a little frantic, as perspectives and word bubbles at all angles clash and vie for your eye\u2019s attention.\n\nIt\u2019s not just White\u2019s story to tell, it\u2019s Rose\u2019s... (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nThere\u2019s no right order to read them in, no correct angle to flip the book to. It\u2019 up, down, sideways, back to front, to the point that sometimes you want to turn it over and see if you\u2019re even holding it the right way up any more. That is, until The Tale of Steven reaches its climax \u2014 the heartwrenching moment from \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d where White Diamond forcefully removes the Pink Diamond Gem from Steven, only for it to manifest not as Pink or Rose, but Steven himself. It\u2019s told over a series of splash pages, but most importantly, those splash pages read from what we would consider the right way up to read a book.\n\nSteven\u2019s perspective \u2014 Steven\u2019s story \u2014 becomes the way to read the book. White relents, her final lines in the book printed the right way up instead of upside down, literally diametrically opposed as they were to Steven\u2019s word bubbles. Pink and Rose\u2019s blurbs fade away. Because, after all, it is the Tale of Steven. Shouldn\u2019t he be the one to tell it?\n\nI can\u2019t help but admit that the first time I flicked through it made me tear up. It\u2019s such a minor, little thing \u2014 such a simple act of turning the actual book one way or the other. And yet it feels like the smartest thing in the world, to take one of Steven Universe\u2019s grandest themes and make it a literal, physical act.\n\n...but most importantly, it\u2019s Steven\u2019s. (Photo: James Whitbrook/io9)\n\nBut in the end, that too is very Steven Universe: something on the surface seeming so simple being far more nuanced and clever than you had initially ever thought it could be.", "description": "There has long been a joy to the physical capacity of holding a book \u2014 even in this age where we can download a million volumes to our phones and e-readers, there\u2019s just something about the heft of a book in your hands that still feels a little bit like magic.
