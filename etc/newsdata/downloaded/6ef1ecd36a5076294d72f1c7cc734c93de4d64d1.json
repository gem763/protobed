Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nAn underground network for Syrian refugees\n\nThe trail through Turkey was once the safest way for refugees to make it out of Syria. But over the past few months, Turkey\u2019s government has tightened border security and deported hundreds of refugees back to Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Turkey\u2019s offensive against Syrian Kurdish militias this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had said that millions of Syrian refugees living in Turkey will be resettled into a newly created buffer zone in Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nIstanbul bureau chief Kareem Fahim and his colleagues from The Washington Post spent several weeks riding along with an underground network of drivers providing a lifeline for Syrians trying to make the journey to relative safety. At a safe house, he met a couple \u2014 Farrah and Besher \u2014 crossing Turkey to get to the Aegean coast, and then, one day, Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nFarrah told him that, despite the tribulations of the journey, she does not see herself returning to Syria. \u201cBad schools, bad hospitals, bad war,\u201d she says. \u201cWar. This word is enough.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s push to win over a constituency that rarely votes\n\nPennsylvania is home to more than 75,000 Amish people. When they vote, they tend to vote Republican.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cBut they typically don\u2019t vote,\u201d says religion reporter Julie Zauzmer . \u201cIt\u2019s not common at all in Amish communities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nZauzmer looked into one group trying to change that. Known as Amish PAC, its goal is to garner more votes for President Trump in 2020 in states both the president and Democrats are desperate to win \u2014 a goal that Zauzmer says could be a tall order.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Kareem Fahim travels with a refugee couple seeking a new life outside of Syria.
