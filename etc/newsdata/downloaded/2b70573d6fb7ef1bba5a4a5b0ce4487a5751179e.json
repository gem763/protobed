Brown posted the fine letter on social media, and Wednesday morning he \u201cgot into it\u201d with general manager Mike Mayock, reporter Adam Schefter tweeted.\n\nThe Next Chapter: Antonio Brown and GM Mike Mayock got into it Wednesday, and the team is now planning to suspend its star wide receiver, league sources tell ESPN. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 5, 2019\n\nAntonio Brown posted the fine letter on social media that Raiders\u2019 GM Mike Mayock sent him. It led to an exchange, which is now leading to further discipline. This is not going away anytime soon. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) September 5, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s been a drama-filled offseason for Brown, even after he got his wish of a trade out of Pittsburgh. Brown hurt his feet when he didn\u2019t wear proper footwear in a cryotherapy chamber, and he briefly threatened retirement if he didn\u2019t get to play with his old helmet model that was no longer approved by the NFL for safety reasons.\n\nIt is unclear how long Brown will be suspended. He also did not play in the Steelers\u2019 final game of 2018 after skipping practice mid-week.\n\nThe Raiders play the Denver Broncos in Week 1 on \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
