We don\u2019t need them\"pic.twitter.com/YhnuTVeCz1 \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) August 30, 2019\n\n\"By the way, we don\u2019t need them. We found that when we were in office\u2026if you would say \u2018you have to report back for a hearing on such-and-such date,' people show up,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep kids in a cage. There should be no justification separating a parent from a child.\"\n\nMany of the \"cages,\" as Democrats now like to call them, were in fact opened during the Obama administration to deal with the massive influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the border.\n\nThomas Homan, Obama's executive associate director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for nearly four years, said recently he knows this for a fact because he was there when they built them in FY 2015.\n\nAs to Biden's claim about illegal immigrants showing up for their hearing, Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan told lawmakers in June that 90 percent of recent asylum seekers skipped their hearing--a trend that was seen in 2015 as well.\n\nBiden is not alone among Democratic presidential candidate in calling for detention facilities to be shut down, however. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have argued the same.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:24:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/c9345e3b-9113-4fa9-b021-190c1b7f0e03.png"}
