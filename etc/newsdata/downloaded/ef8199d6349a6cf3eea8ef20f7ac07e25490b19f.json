The rookie drove in four runs and scored three times.\n\n''I did know my dad had one,'' Cavan Biggio said. ''I have a ticket to the game he got it in in my room my whole life.

''The whole dugout was cheering for him. A triple is hard to get in this ballpark. He was really going all out rounding second. He's aggressive at the plate and he's really doing better.''\n\nTrey Mancini and Jonathan Villar homered for last-place Baltimore, which lost for the third time in four games and dropped to 49-102.\n\nStory continues\n\nMancini finished with four RBIs.

We need better effort.''\n\nREED\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens safety and NFL Hall of Famer Ed Reed threw out a ceremonial first pitch - a strike down the middle.
