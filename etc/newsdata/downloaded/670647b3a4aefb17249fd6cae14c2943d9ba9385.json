You know, so nobody crashes into it.\n\nBut residents aren\u2019t stoked about the situation, claiming the works have been ongoing for at least a week with no resolution in sight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been there for a week, they\u2019ve been working on this for ages,\u201d Warrick said. \u201cApparently installing a roundabout eventually. The designer certainly made a few boo-boos.\u201d\n\nBut the local council reckons this isn\u2019t just a big oopsie daisy, claiming they couldn\u2019t fix the rogue pole even if they wanted to.\n\nAccording to Newcastle City Council Chief Executive Jeremy Bath, the council can\u2019t actually do anything about the rogue post because of a ban on \u201clive work\u201d put in place by Ausgrid.\n\nFollowing the accidental electrocution of an employee in April, electricity provider Ausgrid have put a temporary halt on any work that involves power. I\u2019m no expert here, but I\u2019m fairly certain everything electricity companies do requires power.\n\n\u201cAnything involving electricity, they will not touch,\u201d Bath told Triple M in an interview.\n\n\u201cSo any time that we need \u2014 and we do a whole heap of work where we want Ausgrid to come in and actually turn something off essentially, like a telegraph pole so it can be relocated \u2014 Ausgrid say \u2018Sorry, we can\u2019t do it at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe temporary live work ban came into action after the death of 39-year-old Robert Nicholls, who died while replacing a low-voltage power pole earlier this year. Following the incident, which was the first death in 20 years, Ausgrid has undergone an extensive safety evaluation.\n\nSo, because the council couldn\u2019t remove the pole, they just decided to continue with the rest of the road works and remove the kerb from around it. It\u2019s unclear why anyone thought that was a good, or a safe idea, but it happened.\n\n\u201cSo our choices are we either do no work or we have to stage work such as what you\u2019re seeing in Foundry St.\u201d\n\nThe whole situation is all just a little bit fucked. Ausgrid are trying to keep their employees safe, the city council are trying to actually get work done, and the end result is a wildly inconvenient pole in the middle of Foundry Street.\n\nThe City Of Newcastle Council and Ausgrid are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible because it is clearly a safety hazard for local residents.\n\nNobody is really in the wrong here, and nobody wants to take the blame for it. The result, you ask? A big fuck off power pole in the middle of the street.\n\nAhh, Newcastle. The only city where this story isn\u2019t surprising in the slightest.", "description": "A rogue pole has been left on Foundry Street in Newcastle after the council removed the kerb, but didn't remove the power pole itself.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/r0_324_766_865_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
