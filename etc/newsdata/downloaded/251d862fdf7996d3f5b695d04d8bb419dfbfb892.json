(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nThe effort to avoid singling out Ilhan Omar is putting Democrats in knots.\n\nThe Democratic party is having a rough time condemning anti-Semitism. Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota has, on several occasions, made classically anti-Semitic claims about American Jews, and the effort to formally denounce those statements in the House ruined a week in which the Democrats were supposed to talk about their agenda.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe gist of Omar\u2019s complaints is that the perfidious, string-pulling Hebraic hordes control Congress with their shady shekels; Israel has hypnotized the world; and American Jews are guilty of dual loyalty.\n\nThe controversies have been compounded by the fact that her apologies suggest she\u2019s not actually apologetic. Omar has claimed that the anti-Semitism charge is an effort to silence her because she wants to talk about the Jewish scheme to \u201cpush for allegiance to a foreign country.\u201d In an earlier sorry-not-sorry episode, she apologized for hurting anyone\u2019s feelings, which is not quite the same thing as recanting.\n\nThe whole issue of hurt feelings is a red herring \u2014 which is precisely why so many Democrats want to focus on feelings rather than on the relevant facts. Indeed, if Omar had better facts on her side, she wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\n\nFor instance, Omar seems to think the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is a political-action committee that funds candidates on behalf of Israel. Inconveniently for Omar, AIPAC isn\u2019t a PAC, doesn\u2019t work for Israel, and doesn\u2019t donate to political campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore interesting, however, is the Democratic leadership\u2019s fact problem \u2014 namely the fact Omar simply isn\u2019t a fan of Jews, or at least Jews who support Israel. It\u2019s fine to be a critic of Israel, by the way. But when you hate the country so much that you can\u2019t explain criticism of Israel without resorting to bigotry, you have a problem. Or rather, the Democratic party does.\n\nBecause it\u2019s not just Omar. If Omar had no sympathizers, House speaker Nancy Pelosi would probably have thrown her under the bus already. The younger, fresher, and more radical fringe of the party led by New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesn\u2019t think Omar should be singled out for criticism or censure. In fairness, the primary reason is not that they all share Omar\u2019s hang-up with the Jews. Some are just anti-Israel. Others think it\u2019s unfair that Omar should be criticized when Donald Trump or other Republicans have said bigoted things.\n\nOcasio-Cortez called efforts to censure Omar \u201churtful\u201d because statements by other politicians, most obviously Trump, aren\u2019t similarly condemned. She has something of a point. I certainly wish Republicans did more to condemn many of the things Trump has said. But she seems to have forgotten that Republicans did condemn and punish Iowa representative Steve King recently for his on-brand racist blather.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo while Ocasio-Cortez is right to a point, that point doesn\u2019t take her very far. It\u2019s her party that has established a zero-tolerance-for-bigotry standard. And \u201cwhataboutist\u201d arguments are the lowest form of defense. Some Republicans may be hypocrites for not condemning all bigotry equally, but that\u2019s a criticism of Republicans, not a defense of Omar.\n\nThe effort to avoid singling out Omar is putting Democrats in knots they will be hard-pressed to untie anytime soon. Pelosi has said Omar wasn\u2019t \u201cintentionally anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\nAsked if Omar\u2019s comment about Jewish dual loyalty was anti-Semitic, Representative Emmanuel Cleaver of Missouri offered this profile in courage: \u201cIt may or may not be. I haven\u2019t thought deeply about it.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, offered a baffling defense of Omar by talking about \u2014 surprise! \u2014 her feelings. He says Omar\u2019s experience as a refugee from Somalia who spent time in a Kenyan refugee camp has to be taken into account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are people who tell me, \u2018Well, my parents are Holocaust survivors.\u2019 \u2018My parents did this.\u2019 It\u2019s more personal with her,\u201d Clyburn told The Hill. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to her, and I can tell you she is living through a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nLeave aside the fact that whatever happened to Omar in Kenya or Somalia, it has nothing to do with Israel or Jews. Are we going to have greater tolerance for bigotry based on a time-since-victimhood score? Slavery was even longer ago than the Holocaust. Does that make racist comments less outrageous than anti-Semitic comments?\n\nOn Thursday, Pelosi announced that the House would vote on a resolution condemning all forms of \u201chate.\u201d It\u2019s a transparent dodge to avoid condemning a specific kind of hate.\n\nIt might do the trick to turn the page. But it will almost surely be a temporary respite, because Omar (and others) come to their anti-Semitism honestly, and they\u2019re inclined to be honest about it. So we\u2019ll be here again.", "description": "Omar and others come to their anti-Semitism honestly, and they\u2019re inclined to be honest about it.
