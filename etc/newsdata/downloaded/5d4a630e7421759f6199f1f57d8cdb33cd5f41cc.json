REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands sided with the French rejection of launching accession talks with another Balkan country, Albania in a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg, which ended with no agreement on the matter that would require unanimous backing of all 28 EU states.\n\n\u201cI regret very much that member states could not take a decision,\u201d the visibly upset top EU official dealing with the bloc\u2019s neighbourhood, Johannes Hahn, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a moment of glory for Europe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to restore our credibility in Western Balkans and live up to our commitments. North Macedonia and Albania have done their homework and implemented painful reforms,\u201d he said after EU states shied away from making the step for a third time in a year and a half.\n\nBut France ignored the broad support among EU states to give green lights to the countries sitting in a strategic region on the bloc\u2019s doorstep.\n\nAmelie de Montchalin, France\u2019s European affairs minister, said there could be no way forward before a reform in how and when candidates for membership are vetted on EU targets, which range from economic policy to human rights and the rule of law.\n\nIn Paris, a French presidency official said Macron\u2019s government would not agree to open the talks now.\n\nRelated Coverage France says too early to hold talks with Balkans on EU membership\n\n\u201cThese countries will be part of the European Union one day... but it is too early to open the legal process towards enlargement,\u201d the presidential official said.\n\nFrance says the EU faces too many challenges - including Britain\u2019s planned exit, China, migration and security threats posed by Russia - to let in two more states from the Balkans, a region still scarred by the legacy of 1990s wars and struggling with crime and corruption.\n\nBut the French stance has raised concerns about further delays in an already protracted process that could backfire by spurring Balkan states to cultivate closer ties with Russia, Turkey or China.\n\nIn Berlin, a government official said it was a priority matter for Germany, which will hold its annual summit with France on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cChancellor Angel Merkel will raise the issue with Macron on Wednesday,\u201d the official said, adding that she would also raise the matter at a summit of all 28 national leaders in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. \u201cIt is a... strategic question for the EU.\u201d\n\nWith more worry about Albania\u2019s track-record on fighting corruption and a widely shared desire to award North Macedonia for settling its historic name feud with EU member Greece, the Luxembourg meeting at some point discussed going ahead with Skopje but not Tirana. Paris blocked that attempt as well.\n\n\u201cThe first thing we need to talk about is how Europe must reform the way it does enlargement and negotiations,\u201d de Montchalin said, calling the process \u201can endless soap opera\u201d. \u201cIs the process efficient? From our point of view, no.\u201d\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel holds a speech at a summit organised by engineering association VDMA in Berlin, Germany, October 15, 2019.
