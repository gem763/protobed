It may come as a surprise that the opening rhetorical shot was over an international protest movement targeting Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, otherwise known as BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions).\n\nOn January 3, amid the seemingly intractable government shutdown, Senator Marco Rubio made it his first order of business to sponsor a bill that supports the punishment of any U.S. company or contractor who engages in BDS by refusing to work with Israel. When Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib chided Rubio in a tweet, saying, \u201cthey forgot what country they represent,\u201d and that \u201cmaybe a refresher on our U.S. Constitution is in order,\u201d Rubio promptly shot back.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018dual loyalty\u2019 canard is a typical anti-Semitic line,\u201d the Florida senator tweeted. \u201c#BDS isn\u2019t about freedom & equality, it\u2019s about destroying #Israel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTlaib, newly inaugurated as the country\u2019s first Muslim female congresswoman (along with Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar) returned fire, underscoring that \u201cit\u2019s clear my earlier tweet was critical of U.S. Senators like yourself, who are seeking to strip Americans of their Constitutional right to free speech.\u201d\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: Since this article went to print, Omar has been asked by Democratic leaders to apologize twice for \u201canti-Semitic\u201d comments she made regarding AIPAC\u2019s influence on Congressional legislation and members\u2019 support for Israel]\n\nIt was game on from there. The spat was a skirmish in a much larger war that is being waged by Israel and its supporters across the country against BDS, and may expose one of the biggest fault lines in the Democratic Party today\u2014that of the traditionally pro-Israel Left squaring off against a growing number of progressives who not only sympathize with the Palestinian cause, but don\u2019t truck with the idea of having their ability to engage in political boycotts denied by the government.\n\nThat latter group, which includes liberal heavyweights Senators Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), is finding common cause with other civil libertarians across the political spectrum, including Republican Senator Rand Paul, who penned an op-ed for The American Conservative in January. In it, he said he did not personally support BDS, but recognized that the freedom to boycott is the bedrock of American civic life, from the Boston Tea Party to the Rosa Parks-inspired bus protests in Montgomery, Alabama, which took place over 381 days in 1955 and 1956. \u201cBy all means, opponents of boycotting Israel should be heard\u2014but so should their opponents,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cLegislation to end boycotts goes against the very principles America was founded upon.\u201d\n\nSanders was much more blunt in his response to Rubio. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity,\u201d he tweeted on January 7.\n\nRubio, not exactly known for his elegant ripostes, suggested the government itself has free speech, tweeting, \u201cSo boycotting #Israel is a constitutional right, but boycotting those participating in #BDS isn\u2019t?\u201d He also needled Senate Democrats by suggesting that a \u201csignificant\u201d number of them support the boycotts. It\u2019s a testament to how radioactive this issue is that his charge drew such swift rebuke from Democrat Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who demanded a retraction.\n\nRubio\u2019s bill, after all the attending drama, passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to 23 on February 5. Of course his anti-BDS \u201cStrengthening America\u2019s Security in the Middle East\u201d package also included $38 billion in aid to Israel over 10 years, additional sanctions against the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria, aid to Jordan, and a controversial last-minute amendment by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, admonishing President Donald Trump for pursuing a \u201cprecipitous\u201d military withdrawal from Syria and Afghanistan. The only Republican \u201cnay\u201d vote was Paul. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls voted against it as well, including Senators Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)\n\nA House version of the bill faces a more uncertain future, with majority Democrats, so far, appearing less inclined to bring it to a vote. An anti-BDS bill would certainly divide the ranks publicly\u2014a scene Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi would be loathe to encourage in her first few months back on the job.\n\nRubio\u2019s is the weakest of all the proposed anti-boycott bills to come down the congressional pike, however, in that it merely gives cover to state and local governments that want to punish entities that engage in the anti-Israel protest. As of January, 26 states now have measures that require them to deny contracts to and divest from any companies that are involved in BDS.\n\nOne of the highest-profile cases to date is Bahia Amawi, a child language specialist who was contracted to work in the Texas public school system for nine years until December, when she was fired for refusing to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel. (When Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed his state\u2019s anti-BDS bill in May 2017, he said he was \u201cproud to have commemorated Israel\u2019s Independence Day.\u201d) As journalist Glenn Greenwald pointed out, if she had signed, Amawi would not only be prevented from boycotting goods sold by companies in Israel and the occupied West Bank, but she would be barred \u201ceven from advocating such a boycott given that such speech could be seen as \u2018intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations with Israel.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere were no other requirements in her contract pertaining to political speech. Therefore, she would in theory be free to engage in all sorts of protests against her own country, or any other government in the world, except Israel. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit against the state on behalf of Amawi, alleging the contract violated her right to free speech. They also filed suit on behalf of four more Texans before Christmas, including a public radio station reporter who signed the pledge against his personal beliefs just to keep his job.\n\nRubio\u2019s bill proposes that the \u201csense of Congress\u201d is to support the states that pass these kinds of measures, and that no existing federal law would preempt them. He is four square with the pro-Israel lobby, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), as it ramps up a multi-front campaign to destroy BDS everywhere in the U.S., including college campuses and in state and federal government. And he isn\u2019t the only one. When Representatives Tlaib and Omar became the first members of Congress to openly support BDS, Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.)\u2014who is widely believed to be one of the most vulnerable senators in 2020\u2014spearheaded a letter to the Senate leadership \u201ccondemning BDS\u201d and supporting federal legislation against it. The letter was signed by an additional 14 Republican senators, including Chuck Grassley, Lindsey Graham, and another vulnerable Republican, Susan Collins.\n\nAccording to a 2018 Pew Research Center report, the number of Republicans that sympathize with Israel over Palestine has increased to 79 percent, while sympathy for Israel dropped among Democrats to 27 percent, a disturbing trend especially for the anti-BDS movement. Besides growing sympathy for the Palestinians, progressives are echoing the ACLU and other groups who say any law prohibiting boycotts won\u2019t ultimately survive a Supreme Court test.\n\nThey are probably right. In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982), which involved a boycott on white merchants by black community members and organizations in Claiborne County, Mississippi, in 1966, the Supreme Court explicitly held that the First Amendment protects the right to boycott. Two federal courts relied on this precedent in overturning anti-BDS laws in two states last year.\n\nIn Kansas, a federal judge ruled in January 2018 that a state law requiring any contractor seeking business with the state must \u201ccertify that they are not engaged in a boycott of Israel,\u201d was a direct infringement of the First Amendment. That suit was brought by the ACLU on behalf of Esther Koontz, a Mennonite who personally (and as part of her church\u2019s boycott) refuses to buy goods made in Israel. She lost out on a teaching job with the state because she would not certify otherwise. Kansas has since amended the law to apply only to businesses with contracts of more than $100,000\u2014but the ACLU says it is still unconstitutional. Remember Citizens United and Hobby Lobby? In both cases, the Supreme Court afforded corporations constitutional protections.\n\nIn Arizona, a federal judge specifically recognized the First Amendment rights of companies doing business with the state when in September she ruled in favor of Mikkel Jordahl, who runs a one-man law firm in Sedona. \u201cA restriction of one\u2019s ability to participate in collective calls to oppose Israel unquestionably burdens the protected expression of companies wishing to engage in such a boycott,\u201d Judge Diane Humetewa wrote in her opinion for Jordahl et al v. Brnovich et al.\n\nThis of course has not stopped other states from pursuing their own versions of the law. Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo reportedly has a blacklist of companies that the state will not work with because they violate the anti-BDS executive order he issued in 2016. Maryland\u2019s Republican Governor Larry Hogan signed his own executive order banning boycotters from state contracts in October 2017. When asked about the constitutional concerns, Hogan dismissed them outright.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking [companies and individuals] to discriminate against Israel,\u201d Hogan said of BDS. \u201cThere\u2019s no argument to the contrary that makes any sense.\u201d Alan Ronkin, a regional director for the American Jewish Committee (AJC), on hand for the signing, insisted that people are free to say whatever they want about Israel, but \u201cthe state is free to do business with companies that reflect its values.\u201d (AJC is a fierce BDS critic that for years has argued that \u201canti-Zionism is a form of anti-Semitism.\u201d)\n\nSyed Saqib Ali, a former Maryland state delegate, doubts that is how the Constitution works. He is suing the state because he says Hogan\u2019s edict \u201cchills constitutionally protected political advocacy,\u201d and is preventing him from getting a job with the state.\n\n\u201cTo even apply for that job, I have to give up my free speech rights,\u201d Ali told a reporter in January. \u201cI will not tolerate that.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s senior Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat, along with Senator Rob Portman, (R-Ohio), has been trying to pass his own federal anti-BDS legislation for some time now. Their proposal targets individuals, not just companies, so it could be much more dangerous. They even tried, unsuccessfully, to sneak it into the package of spending bills aiming to avoid the shutdown in December. The Israel Anti-Boycott Act focuses on expanding the 1979 Export Administration Act to prohibit any U.S. person involved in \u201cinterstate or foreign commerce\u201d from engaging in \u201cany boycott fostered or imposed by any international governmental organization against Israel.\u201d\n\nThe bill suggests that a non-binding 2016 United Nations Human Rights Council resolution supporting BDS stands in for the offending \u201cinternational governmental organization.\u201d From there it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to see how this law could affect anyone remotely involved in the boycott. An earlier iteration involved prison time for violators. The sponsors have since softened it with an amendment, taking away jail time but imposing financial fines. But adding that nothing in their bill \u201cshall be construed to diminish or infringe upon any right protected under the First Amendment,\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily make it so.\n\nSo why all the energy to have it fail in court? Critics believe that most of these efforts are largely designed to intimidate. On the college level, a recent investigative series by The Forward magazine shed light on a massive online blacklist called canarymission.org. Its motto is, \u201cif you\u2019re racist, the world should know.\u201d Many of the outed \u201cracists\u201d and \u201canti-Semites\u201d on the site are students and professors who have merely questioned Israeli policies and supported BDS, and are now forced to scrub their reputations. According to reporter Josh Nathan-Kazis, this is one flank in a much greater, well-coordinated rapid response force involving groups ranging from AIPAC to the David Horowitz Freedom Center that fly into action at the whiff of a protest or student government resolution on campus.\n\n\u201cThe total amount of American Jewish and Israeli government funds flooding the anti-BDS effort is easily in the tens of millions of dollars each year,\u201d Nathan-Kazis wrote in August.\n\nIf that\u2019s ground zero, then what\u2019s happening on Capitol Hill is the final destination, the promise of a blanket federal edict that would stop all boycotts\u2014no matter where they are\u2014in their tracks. The success of this unprecedented effort to control speech partly depends on Democrats continuing to divide on this issue, and whether Tlaib and Omar are early harbingers, signaling a brave new civil libertarian stand on the issue\u2014or not.\n\nKelley Beaucar Vlahos is Executive Editor of The American Conservative.
