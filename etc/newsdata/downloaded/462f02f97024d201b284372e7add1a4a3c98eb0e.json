(Dreamstime)\n\nQ: When my mother purchased her home 10 years ago, she put me on the title with her. I do not live in the home. She did this so that if she was unable to sell it or she died, I would be able to sell it.\n\nHer intent was to have me split the profits from the sale with my siblings. She purchased the house for about $150,000. The home is currently valued at about $300,000. My thought was that when my mom needed additional care and to move into a facility, the sale of her home would help with those expenses.\n\nMy mom is currently 85 and is still able to live in her home without assistance. At this point, if she is able to stay in her home until she passes, how does that affect me tax-wise? My mom does not have a will, and the home is her only asset other than her bank accounts, on which I am also listed as the joint owner.\n\nA: Your mom\u2019s home has doubled in price in 10 years, and that\u2019s a great thing. Because you and your mom jointly own the home, you could say that you own half of the home and your mom owns the other half. If you were to sell the home today, your mom would pay no tax on the profits on the sale of her half (because she lives there full time), and you\u2019d have to pay federal capital gains tax (and perhaps state tax) on the sale of your half. Frequently, when parents sell their home that is jointly owned with their kids, they will claim the entire profit for themselves and pay no federal income taxes.\n\n[More Matters: Yes, you need your own insurance policy for your condo unit beyond the association\u2019s policy]\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service allows homeowners who have lived in their home as a primary residence for two out of the past five years to exclude up to $250,000 of profits from any federal income taxes. That increases to $500,000 for married couples. And that\u2019s a huge tax break for homeowners. There are some other rules and requirements, but the basic rules mean most homeowners won\u2019t pay any taxes if they have profits on the sale of their primary residence.\n\nAnother tax break that homeowners and real estate investors get is when they die. Your mom has a $150,000 gain on the home, as the home's value has doubled. When she dies, the IRS will allow her estate to step up the value of the home to the market value at or around the time of her death. That means that when you and your siblings inherit the home and sell it, you will be deemed to have received it at a value of $300,000 and sold it for the same amount. In this situation, you and your siblings would not owe federal income on the profit your mom would have made.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub. Your mom doesn\u2019t own the home on her own. She owns the home with you. At the time of her death, her estate will get the stepped-up basis on her half of the home; but when you and your siblings sell the home, you\u2019ll have to pay federal income taxes on the gain on your half-ownership of the home.\n\nThis is one reason we don\u2019t recommend that parents and kids own homes jointly, especially if a property has appreciated substantially in value. We prefer to see parents own their homes in their own name to enable the parent to get the full value of the home sale tax exclusion of $250,000 ($500,000 for married couples) when they sell or for their beneficiaries to get the stepped-up basis when they die.\n\nHow else can parents pass down property and avoid probate? Try a living trust. When a property is in a living trust, the trust is the owner of the property and the parent controls the trust. If the parent becomes incapacitated or dies, the successor trustee designated by the parent controls the trust.\n\nIn your situation, your mom\u2019s home would be owned by the living trust, and your mom would be the trustee and beneficiary of the trust. In the document, she would name you as the successor trustee and would name you and your siblings as successor beneficiaries.\n\n[More Matters: Make sure you and your spouse are on same page on who will inherit your home]\n\nIf she sold the home, she\u2019d get the full benefit of the home sale exclusion. When she dies, her estate will get the benefit of the stepped-up basis on the current value of the property. It\u2019s a win either way.\n\nYou should ask an estate lawyer if there is anything you should do at this point to lessen the tax burden you\u2019ll eventually face.\n\nYou also may want to ask the estate lawyer about the total value of your mother\u2019s assets, and what needs to happen in case she can\u2019t afford her care and must deplete her assets to qualify for Medicaid.\n\nIf your mother needs to go into assisted living, Medicaid would want to apply the value of her home toward her care. If you and she have owned the home together for at least five years, Medicaid may go after her one-half interest in the home but may not be able to go after your half. An estate lawyer should be able to educate you on what the Medicaid requirements might be, what assets your mother would be allowed to keep and what the spend-down requirements would be, should her health and circumstances require it.\n\nIlyce Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\u201d (4th Edition).
