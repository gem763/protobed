In order to protect and promote public safety and welfare, the Minneapolis Police Department has issued a request to temporarily suspend all scooter rental operations from the City\u2019s right of way during the date of the event. Pursuant to Article IV, Section 4 and Article III, Section 1(c) of your License Agreement, all scooters in your local fleet must be removed from the City\u2019s right of way no later than 9:00 p.m. (CDT) on Wednesday, October 9th.. Thereafter, scooters may not be distributed to, or made available for rental from any City right of way on October 10, 2019. Scooter rental operations may resume under normal License Agreement terms beginning on October 11th.\n\nScooter companies are already complying with the order. A screenshot of Lime\u2019s app posted to Reddit features a message that reads: \u201cDue to a visit from the President of the United States, Lime will be temporarily offline until 10/11.\u201d In addition to Lime, the city has three other authorized scooter operators: Jump (n\u00e9e Uber), Spin, and Lyft. The city has around 2,000 scooters currently in service under the provisions of a pilot program. (Despite being selected, Jump chose not to participate in Minneapolis\u2019 pilot program.)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has been feuding with the mayor of Minneapolis over costs associated with the rally and security. The Star Tribune reported that road closures and traffic are expected as a result of the president\u2019s appearance. According to the city\u2019s police chief, pedestrian and vehicle traffic will be significantly reduced around the Target Center where Trump will hold his rally.\n\nScooter companies have proactively taken their vehicles out of service in other cities, mostly in reaction to extreme weather and flooding.\n\nUpdated October 10th, 3:58PM ET: Added details about Jump\u2019s lack of scooters in the city.", "description": "Scooter startups are being temporarily banished from the streets of Minneapolis ahead of a rally October 10th by President Donald Trump.
