But other folks become interested in polyamorous relationships because they believe they can get something out of the arrangement their partner isn't able to offer them, like hotter sex or simply more attention.\n\nRead more: 6 habits that are secretly sabotaging your relationship, according to therapists\n\nBefore broaching the topic with your partner, consider which of these camps you fall under (chatting with a couple's therapist could help). If it's the latter, an open marriage may not be the best idea for you and your partner.\n\nSexual fulfillment is an important part of a successful relationship, but that's something you should first try to seek within your marriage, even if, on the surface, you think you and your partner's sex life or communication skills are already as good as they're going to get.\n\nBefore you really consider an open relationship, have an honest conversation with your spouse\n\nRather than asking your partner about trying polyamory right off the bat, be honest with them about what you want in the bedroom, like more foreplay or role-playing. Chances are they didn't realize your sexual needs weren't being met, and they'll be willing \u2014 and likely excited \u2014 to work on your requests.\n\nPerhaps you subconsciously feel you're not getting enough attention from your partner. laflor/Getty Images\n\nIf this conversation sounds impossible to initiate, your marriage will suffer if you open your relationship. Think about it: If you can't even communicate openly about sex within your own marriage, how will you navigate having sex with other people while maintaining that relationship?\n\nYou should also consider whether there's something nonsexual that's appealing to you about an open relationship. Perhaps you subconsciously feel you're not getting enough attention from your partner, or that you miss having the deep conversations that can come more naturally during the honeymoon phase of a relationship.\n\nIf your emotional needs aren't being met, you should also address them with your spouse before having a discussion about opening the marriage.\n\nBe vulnerable during your conversations\n\nAfter that, if you still want an open relationship, it's important to bring vulnerability into that conversation with your spouse, Kolawole said.\n\nRead more: How to know if you've fallen out of love \u2014 and if your relationship is salvageable\n\n\"Share what you're curious about and why you feel that way with the understanding your partner could have a range of responses, whether curiosity, panic, or anger,\" she said. \"People can get triggered about their own stuff, so also recognize your partner may take it personally.\"\n\nYou can't control whether your partner gets upset over your open-marriage inquiry, but you can open a channel for honest communication. That will serve your relationship well \u2014 regardless of the outcome of just that one chat.", "description": "Before you even broach the subject of an open relationship with your spouse, it's important to consider why you want one in the first place.", "authors": ["Julia Naftulin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9f9d9acc4a0a311b34f13b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
