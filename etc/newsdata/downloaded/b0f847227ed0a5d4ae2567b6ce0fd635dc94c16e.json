She was my best friend and I enjoy her company and I look forward to having her with me day-to-day,' Mr Dabboussy said.\n\nKamalle Dabboussy warned it could be just days before it's too late to get Mariam (pictured) and the three minors - aged one, three and five - out of Syria's Al-Hawl camp\n\nMariam Dabboussy was not a devout Muslim but her life changed at 22 when she married Kaled Zahab (pictured). The woman who had been a childcare and migrant support worker went to the Middle East in mid-2015 with her husband and their 18-month-old child\n\n'I look forward to being a grandfather again.'\n\nA looming withdrawal of just 50 US troops from northeastern Syria will leave Kurdish-led forces allied to Washington vulnerable to a planned incursion by the Turkish military, which brands them terrorists.\n\nThe US began pulling troops back from the northeast Syrian border on Monday, effectively giving Turkey a green light to move into the area. Any conflict could spill over into the area holding the Al-Hawl camp.\n\n'The Middle East is a very unstable place and it's very hard to determine how much time is left. I would suggest that it's days and certainly not much more than that,' Mr Dabboussy said.\n\nFederal Labor is urging the Morrison government to speed up the evacuation of Australians from Al-Hawl.\n\n'The opportunity, the window if you will, to safely extract the children and indeed those people who are adults is coming to a close,' opposition home affairs spokeswoman Senator Kristina Keneally said.\n\nBut Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the government won't rush to evacuate them.\n\n'We will not put Australian officials, forces or our public in danger so any repatriation will occur only if safe to do so,' she said.\n\nThe Australian government is consulting with its allies about developments in Syria and is urging restraint by all parties.\n\nAustralian Greens leader Richard Di Natale urged the government to act quickly.\n\n'Scott Morrison's government also has a responsibility to look after Australian citizens who have been left to languish in camps inside Syria,' he said in a statement.\n\nMs Dabboussy, who had been a childcare and migrant support worker in Sydney, went to the Middle East in mid-2015 with her husband and their 18-month-old child\n\nNews of the US withdrawal has been met with confusion, fear and panic by Australians in Al-Hawl.\n\n'They are by themselves and they desperately need the help of the Australian government for their survival,' Mr Debboussy said.\n\nIt's not just the disease and lack of medical care, but extremists inside the camp and 'sleeper cells' beyond its fences, putting his family and others at risk of death.\n\n'We have been saying for some time that if the Australians are left there much longer, there will be an Australian death. And I firmly believe that is the case,' Mr Debboussy said.\n\nMariam and other women had been duped and coerced into entering Syria and did not pose a threat to Australia, he claimed. Her eldest child was born in Australia and the other two, in Syria.\n\nMariam Dabboussy was not a devout Muslim, but her life changed at age 22 when she married Kaled Zahab.\n\nMariam and other women had been duped and coerced into entering Syria and did not pose a threat to Australia, he claimed.

So, it was the first time he had agreed to take me overseas.\n\n'We had a really nice holiday planned. We went to Malaysia, took me to Dubai, we went to Lebanon.'\n\nMs Dabboussy was initially taken from Lebanon to a house in southern Turkey near the Syria border.\n\nFrom there, she was driven to a dusty patch of land.\n\n'There was other people there and there was... there was a man there,' she said.\n\n'And he started telling us, ''Run before they shoot, 'Run before they start shooting.'' And we didn't know what was going on.'\n\n'I looked around, I'm thinking, ''What am I going to do?'' I'm in the middle of nowhere, I don't even know where I am. There's gunshots. Now I just started running.'\n\nShe didn't get far, with men bundling her into a car and taking her to a house, which had a black Islamic State flag.\n\n'When I entered that house and I saw a flag, I saw a flag and I sort of asked around,' Ms Dabboussy said.\n\n'Some women, they spoke very broken Arabic, they didn't really speak. They were sort of surprised I didn't know what was going on. Some of them laughed at me.\n\nA picture taken on February 25, 2017 shows a general view of the tents housing displaced Iraqi refugees who have recently fled from Mosul in a camp in al-Hol\n\nZehra Duman, who fled Australia as a teenager to marry an Islamic State fighter, was notified of the government's decision in recent days\n\n'I mean, as it went along we just basically figured out that we just gotten conned by the boys.'\n\nThe man Ms Dabboussy married is now dead, after being killed by a coalition airstrike three months later.\n\nThe mother-of-three has since been forced to remarry twice more and claims life has only gotten harder.\n\n'I would like to say it was the hardest time... But everything that happened after it was just more epic,' she told ABC's Four Corners.\n\n'So, from the beginning, the first shock of entering and being in Syria, you'd think that would be the biggest thing.\n\n'But every event that happened after that only got harder and harder.'\n\nMeanwhile, a notorious jihadi bride has reportedly been stripped of her Australian citizenship.\n\nZehra Duman, who fled Australia as a teenager to marry an Islamic State fighter, was notified of the government's decision in recent days.\n\nDuman is a dual Turkish and Australian citizen.\n\nThere are concerns the decision could leave her children, aged one and three, stateless.\n\nThe government declined to comment publicly on the case.\n\nHowever, a spokeswoman said generally the cancellation of a parent's citizenship did not sever their child's ties to Australia.\n\n'Nor is there any power for the minister to revoke the child's Australian citizenship in these circumstances,' she added.", "description": "Kamalle Dabboussy warned it could be just days before it's too late to get Mariam and the three minors - aged one, three and five - out of Syria's Al-Hawl camp.", "authors": ["Stephen Johnson For Daily Mail Australia", "Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/05/19426014-0-image-a-2_1570507627447.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
