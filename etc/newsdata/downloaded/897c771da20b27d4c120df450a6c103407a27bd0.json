She is not only seeking compensation for the physical and emotional damage she suffered but to change the way those who are cooperating with Ice are treated by those in a position of power and who often wield total control over the ability to remain in the United States.\u201d\n\nAn Ice spokesman told the Associated Press he couldn\u2019t comment on litigation but confirmed Rodriguez no longer works for the agency. Homeland security didn\u2019t immediately return a call seeking comment.\n\nRelated: Thousands of migrant children allegedly sexually abused in US custody\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Rodriguez had a lawyer to speak for him, and a phone listing for him could not immediately be found, according to the AP.\n\nTom Carson, a spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Connecticut, told the AP he could not comment on whether there has been or will be a criminal investigation.\n\nThe woman first met the Ice agent in 2006 after her brother was arrested for entering the US illegally, according to the lawsuit.\n\nRodriguez found out she was also living in the country illegally and said that to avoid deportation she would have to become an informant by helping Ice locate criminals. According to the lawsuit she did so, but, in 2007, Rodriguez sexually assaulted her in a motel.\n\nHe called himself the \u201cwolf\u201d and said he was the reason she and her family weren\u2019t deported, she says in the lawsuit.\n\nThe woman alleges that the assaults continued and resulted in three pregnancies, each followed by abortions, one of which Rodriguez paid for.\n\nLater, he told her that he was leaving the agency but that if she told anyone what happened, \u201cshe and her family would pay\u201d, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe woman finally told her story last year when her father, living in the US and fearing deportation because of her friendliness with Ice, applied for asylum. She opened up to an agent who approached her about her father\u2019s application, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe agent, she says, suggested she consult an attorney.", "description": "In a $10m lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she says the officer threatened her with deportationA Honduran woman has sued the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency over sexual assault she says occurred over a period of seven years.
