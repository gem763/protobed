Susan Collins\u2019 Husband, Tom Daffron, Bought Akamai Stock, Sold Covetrus", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nSenator Susan Collins recently disclosed that her husband, Thomas Daffron, made some stock trades in August.\n\nSpecifically, the Maine Republican\u2019s spouse bought Akamai Technologies stock (ticker: AKAM) and sold shares of Covetrus (CVET), an animal-health company.\n\n\u201cTom Daffron has no involvement in the purchase or sale of any of the stocks in his diversified portfolio,\u201d Sen. Collins\u2019 office said in a written response to a request for comment on Daffron\u2019s trades. \u201cThese investment decisions are made exclusively by a third-party advisor.\u201d\n\nDaffron\u2019s account bought Akamai stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 on Aug. 20, according to a form that Sen. Collins filed with the Secretary of the Senate. Specific values aren\u2019t required for disclosure, only ranges.\n\nThe stock of the cybersecurity firm has surged this year. Through Friday\u2019s close, Akamai stock sports a year-to-date gain of 48.0%, more than twice the 20.0% rise in the S&P 500. Last year, both Akamai stock and the index slipped about 6%. Akamai stock has risen in 2019 on strong earnings as its focus on a \u201czero trust\u201d approach to security seems to be paying off.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nThis is the first transaction in Akamai stock for Daffron\u2019s account this year. Another regulatory form that Sen. Collins filed earlier showed that Daffron didn\u2019t own any Akamai stock at the end of 2018.\n\nDaffron didn\u2019t own any Covetrus stock at the end of 2018, either. That\u2019s because health-care supplier Henry Schein (HSIC) spun off Covetrus in February. Daffron owned Henry Schein stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 at Dec. 31.\n\nDaffron\u2019s account sold Covetrus stock valued between $1,001 and $15,000 on Aug. 15, his first transaction in the animal-health company\u2019s shares, which may be playing dead. Covetrus stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value since closing at $46.19 on Feb. 6, its first day of trading publicly.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal noted last month that the approval rating for Sen. Collins had turned net negative, an interesting development because she was re-elected in 2014 with 68% of the vote.\n\nCollins has said that she is confident she would win re-election in 2020, should she run again.\n\nInside Scoop is a regular Barron\u2019s feature covering stock transactions by corporate executives and board members\u2014so-called insiders\u2014as well as large shareholders, politicians, and other prominent figures.
