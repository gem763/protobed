The company later sifted through surveillance footage and spotted the deliveryman stealing cakes from a warehouse in Queens \u201calmost two dozen times,\u201d the Post wrote.\n\nThe employee reportedly stopped showing up to work when the bakery began investigating. He has since pleaded guilty to petty larceny.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nLady M was not immediately available to comment on the lawsuit, although a current employee who spoke with the Post claims the shop has installed more security at the warehouse. However, the same employee also partially blamed \u201cmismanagement\u201d for allowing the thief to get away with his actions for so long, and said Lady M \u201cshould have been doing their inventory.\u201d\n\nThe deliveryman is due in criminal court later this month. The bake shop is seeking to recoup the value of the stolen goods \u2014 with interest \u2014 as well as other damages.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLady M currently operates seven locations in the New York area, with others in Boston and Chicago.
