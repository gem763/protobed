The Independent Commission Against Corruption has heard evidence Jamie Clements turned to Mr Huang for help when he lost his political job. Mr Clements was allegedly given $200,000 to help him re-start his career as a consultant. ICAC is investigating claims the banned donor handed Mr Clements a $100,000 cash donation in March 2015. The party is accused of using fake declaration forms to hide the true identity of the donor. The former NSW Labor boss is due to take the stand on Wednesday.
