Like we\u2019re sitting there watching it, balling, as they\u2019re like \u201cthis feels so good and natural, why haven\u2019t we been doing this our whole lives?!\u201d\u2019\n\nBobby helps a struggling married couple reconnect through intimacy (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018Another one of our heroes, she\u2019d been bullied a lot as a child, and one of the odd things she was bullied for was because she had nice breasts,\u2019 he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In Japan, voluptuous breasts are seen as not normal. We all [had something to say about it]. They were gorgeous! Embrace those.\n\n\u2018But she was like \u201cthe Fab Five were hugging me and I know that everything is OK\u201d. And I was like, if we can change one thing about Japan, it\u2019s literally like, we changed them with one hug in Japan.\n\nMore: Queer Eye Queer Eye's Antoni Porowski isn't defining his sexuality: 'I like not knowing' Queer Eye's Antoni Porowski hates single life as he's 'terrified' of being alone Queer Eye dog Bruley dies after suffering from heart problems as Fab Five pay tribute\n\n\u2018Just a little thing like that we take for granted, for thousands of years has never been part of their culture, and they\u2019re realising \u201cOh this is nice, it feels good!\u201d\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve got our tissue boxes at the ready for another heartwarming blub-fest guys.
