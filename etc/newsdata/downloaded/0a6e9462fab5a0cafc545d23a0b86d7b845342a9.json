The endangered clan of 73 orcas became a regional cause celebre last summer after a grieving mother orca carried the body of her dead calf for 17 days.\n\nThe orcas track salmon using echolocation, or sonar, and research has shown that the din in these heavily trafficked waters has hampered their ability to detect prey. Reducing vessel noise was a key recommendation of the Orca Task Force assembled last March by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of quick action,\u201d McCann said. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen that urgency.\u201d\n\nOnce officials know the noise level each of the seven classes of ferries emits at various speeds, the agency will pair the details with a recently launched orca-tracking app. Ferry captains will be directed to slow down or reroute to accommodate the orcas.\n\nState officials also want to \u00adquiet the discord affecting Olympic National Park, a landscape of coastal and mountain wilderness west of Seattle. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, is suing to prevent the Navy from increasing flights over the park, citing effects on both nearby residents and wild animals, including endangered species.\n\nAD\n\nThese issues have made Washington one of the rare states to recognize sound pollution as a threat to its wildlife. Increasingly, research shows that human-caused noise can be harmful to many species. But little regulation \u2014 and even less enforcement \u2014 exists in the United States to limit the increasing encroachment of noise on the environment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe literature has shown that noise fundamentally changes behavior, distributions and reproductive success [for wildlife],\u201d said Jesse Barber, who runs the Sensory Ecology Lab at Boise State University. \u201cWe can now clearly say that noise is a pollutant, but that takes some time to work its way into policy.\u201d\n\nWashington state Sen. Christine Rolfes (D) said she expects the issue to gain visibility.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt might be one of the next frontiers of pollution regulations,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that people have ever thought of noise as pollution. I certainly wasn\u2019t that aware of it until recently.\u201d\n\nMost local noise ordinances address nuisance noise in residential areas, the kind of racket that draws neighbors\u2019 complaints and has been shown to harm human health. Fewer legal guidelines exist to protect wildlife.\n\nAD\n\nBut states wanting to address the problem face challenges. Noise doesn\u2019t stop at state, county or city boundaries. Many of the loudest sources are related to transportation; short of tearing up highways and relocating airports, officials have no obvious solutions. And law enforcement agencies may not have the resources to patrol with decibel meters and seek out violators.\n\nAD\n\nScience has illustrated the harmful effects noise has on wildlife.\n\nSeveral years ago, Barber and a team of scientists installed 15 speakers in an Idaho woodland and played traffic noises to create a \u201cphantom road\u201d over a half-mile of terrain. They found that 30 percent of songbirds moved elsewhere once the noise began, and many other species that remained struggled to gain weight.\n\nEarly efforts to regulate noise began in 1972, when the Environmental Protection Agency created the Office of Noise Abatement and Control, which set policy standards that many states used as benchmarks for their own regulations. Those included noise limits for the trucking industry, construction equipment and the transportation sector.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut when the Reagan administration shut down the office a decade later, citing a desire to transfer more regulatory power to local governments, states\u2019 appetite for noise policy withered as well, experts say. As a result, noise pollution has grown largely unchecked in prevalence and intensity.\n\nThe EPA argued that local communities could better regulate noise, said Les Blomberg, executive director of the Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, a nonprofit group that tracks noise regulations throughout the country. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent the last 40 years proving that wrong. Local communities can do a lot to regulate noise, but a lot of noise comes from noise sources in interstate commerce.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton dubbed a hidden spot in Olympic\u2019s Hoh Rainforest the One Square Inch of Silence, the quietest location in the contiguous United States. He has made it his mission to protect this place, and he is among many state residents concerned by the Navy\u2019s proposal to increase training flights of its Growler jets over the park.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPrior to the Navy arriving, it was not only the least noise-polluted national park in the U.S., it was also the most noise-diverse,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are sounds you can\u2019t hear anywhere else.\u201d\n\nOne Square Inch is about a three-mile hike into the rainforest, amid chest-high ferns and moss-covered trees. The nearby Hoh River babbles in the distance, while nearby birds chirp incessantly. At regular intervals, though \u2014 rarely longer than a half-hour \u2014 the forest buzzes with the whine of a distant plane, or rumbles at a low-passing jet. Hempton said 80 percent of flights over the area are now conducted by the military.\n\n\u201cYou add noise pollution into the background, and the owl that\u2019s hunting at night can no longer hear the soft scratching of the rodent underneath the leaves,\u201d Hempton said.\n\nAD\n\nThe Navy\u2019s plan, which would increase by about a third its operations from a nearby air station, has prompted residents and organizations to form a coalition called the Sound Defense Alliance.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are squeezing all those natural sounds out of our environment,\u201d said Larry Morrell, the alliance\u2019s executive director.\n\nThe Navy has said the training is vital, and it stands behind its environmental review of the proposal, which found that the expansion is not likely to \u201cjeopardize the continued existence\u201d of endangered species.\n\nMichael Welding, a public affairs officer with Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, said in an email that the Navy could not comment on questions related to its endangered species analysis because of pending litigation.\n\nAD\n\nHe noted, however, that the Navy already conducts an average of 2,300 Growler flights a year over the area that includes the park, and the proposal would raise that by only an additional 300 flights. Welding also said the Olympic Peninsula is an important training area, both because of its geographic diversity and airspace availability.\n\nAD\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn another front, the Port of Seattle also is trying to crack down on noise. It oversees the docking of massive container ships that cross the Pacific Ocean and are the loudest ships on the water.\n\nPort of Seattle Commissioner Fred Felleman said the orcas are such a popular cause that many in the maritime industry might voluntarily slow vessel speeds and stay away from whale feeding areas, while bolstering research on the effects of underwater noise.\n\nThe port also has provided onshore power sources for ships to plug into while they\u2019re docked, so they no longer have to run noisy generators while they\u2019re sitting in the water.\n\nTo what extent state leaders will try to clamp down further on noise pollution remains unclear. In response to Ferguson\u2019s legal challenge, the Navy has said it will reevaluate whether its flight plans violate the Endangered Species Act, looking at disturbances to the marbled murrelet, a threatened seabird. That review is expected to be completed early next year.\n\nStateline is an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts.", "description": "A struggle to tamp down noise pollution that\u2019s harmful to orcas, birds and other animals", "authors": ["Alex Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7lQ1iyIM4QKNlTCTD5lf9bTNitI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CBVGA5XWPQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
