The crude shipping market has turned upside down since then, with prices for some tankers recently going far beyond $100,000 a day, the WSJ Logistics Report\u2019s Costas Paris writes, and average rates hitting the highest levels in 11 years. Shipping rates have been skyrocketing since the U.S. imposed sanctions last month on energy transport units of China\u2019s Cosco Shipping Group over alleged transport of illicit shipments of Iranian oil. That\u2019s buffeted oil markets facing a series of geopolitical geopolitical shocks that have sown what one tanker operator called \u201ca lot of uncertainty and confusion.\u201d The troubles including sanctions against Iran and Venezuela and production disruptions in Saudi Arabia have boosted U.S. oil exports to Europe to record highs as buyers try to secure cargoes as winter approaches.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES\n\nThe microscopes on food supply chains are getting more powerful than ever. Big food companies such as Mondelez International Inc. and Unilever PLC are responding to increasing pressure from consumers for more transparency on sourcing in part by serving up detailed new information online about the commodities they buy around the world. The WSJ\u2019s Micah Maidenberg writes that data that once was the domain only of purchasing specialists and transportation planners is starting to give investors and the public a glimpse into the sprawling supply chains behind many companies. Food makers say the effort covering goods like palm oil contrasts with longstanding sourcing practices. By their nature, commodities are undifferentiated products meant to be easily aggregated, traded and shipped, and sourcing has often been considered a trade secret. New technology makes tracking the information easier, but companies say pressure from consumers and investors may be the biggest driver of change.\n\nFood and beverage companies are taking their sourcing strategies to the garbage. Mondelez, Starbucks Corp. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA are among several industry giants looking to develop foods and drinks from foodstuffs such as cocoa husks and spent brewing grain that they and their suppliers have typically discarded. The WSJ\u2019s Heather Haddon and Lucy Craymer write the moves to upend development and sourcing is part of an effort to attract consumers who say they want companies to waste less and limit their environmental impact. They\u2019re certainly not lacking for raw materials: One study says U.S. farmers and manufacturers create around 11 million tons of food waste a year. Food makers are joining textile companies in the effort, and the market appears to be ripe. Sales of consumer goods marketed as sustainable, simple or organic grew to some $130 billion in the U.S. last year, up 12% from 2015.\n\nQUOTABLE\n\n\u201c \u2019The market has gone bonkers.\u2019 \u201d \u2014George Lazaridis of Allied Shipbroking, on oil tanker rates.\n\nNumber of the Day 38 The number of parcels shipped per person on average in the U.S. in 2018, according to a Pitney Bowes study of parcel shipping trends.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS\n\nExplosions hit an Iranian tanker off Saudi Arabia, sending oil prices higher.
