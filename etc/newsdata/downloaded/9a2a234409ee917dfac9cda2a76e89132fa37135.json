The prognosis for the disease is grim: Just 3 percent of patients survive for five years or longer.\n\nWhen Trebek announced his diagnosis six months ago, he said he was determined to fight it. And he sounded a hopeful note again Tuesday as he disclosed he is back for more chemo.\n\n\u201cHey, they worked very well the first time so we\u2019re expecting good results again,\u201d he told his fans. \u201cBut please keep me in your good thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\nIn his GMA interview, Trebek said he\u2019s been battling depression and would get teary-eyed while filming the 35th season of Jeopardy! But, he said, he is not afraid of dying.\n\n\u201cI realize that there is an end in sight for me, just as there is for everyone else. One line that I have used with our staff in recent weeks and months is that when I do pass on, one thing they will not say at my funeral is, \u2018Oh, he was taken from us too soon,\u2019\u201d Trebek said.\n\n\u201cThe thought of passing on doesn\u2019t frighten me, it doesn\u2019t. Other things do, the affect it will have on my loved ones... it makes me sad. But the thought of myself moving on, hey folks, it comes with the territory.\u201d", "description": "\u201cJeopardy!\u201d host says his numbers \u201cwent south\u201d after finishing his first round and immunotherapy didn\u2019t work.", "authors": ["Tracy Connor", "Executive Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_71/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568729537/GettyImages-944057894_emx86v", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
