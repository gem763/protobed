The XLM/USD pair broke a couple of important resistances near the $0.0580 and $0.0600 resistance levels to move into a bullish zone. Moreover, there was a close above the $0.0600 resistance area and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It opened the doors for more gains above the $0.0620 level.\n\nThe price traded as high as $0.0651 and it recently corrected lower. However, the $0.0600 support area protected declines. A low was formed near $0.0592 and the price is currently climbing higher. It traded above the $0.0620 resistance area. Additionally, there was a break above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0651 high to $0.0592 low.\n\nAt the moment, the price is trading near the $0.0640 resistance area. It seems like the 76.4% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0651 high to $0.0592 low is acting as a resistance. The main resistance is near the $0.0650 resistance area. A successful break could push the price towards the $0.0680 and $0.0700 resistance levels.\n\nOn the downside, there are many supports forming near the $0.0610 and $0.0600 levels. Moreover, there is a crucial bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0610 on the 4-hours chart. The 55 SMA is also near the $0.0610 level. Therefore, a downside break below the $0.0600 support area might start a major correction towards the $0.0580 and $0.0550 levels.\n\nThe chart indicates that XLM price is showing a lot of positive signs above the $0.0600 level. The price action is positive and suggests more gains above the $0.0650 resistance area.
