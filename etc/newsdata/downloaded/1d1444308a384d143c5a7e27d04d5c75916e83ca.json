(Image: Paramount)\n\nForty years ago a landmark moment in Star Trek\u2019s history arrived, in the form of Star Trek: The Motion Picture. It\u2019s an important chapter in the series\u2019 survival, the turning point from cancelled cult classic to enduring icon of science fiction. But there is a reason we remember The Motion Picture\u2019s place in history more than we remember The Motion Picture: It\u2019s boring as all hell.\n\nAs fans across America prepare to revisit TMP this month in celebratory screenings ahead of its actual 40th birthday this December, what they\u2019re about to re-experience is a moment in history that is perhaps best remembered as such than for what it actually is. The Motion Picture\u2019s existence is paradoxical.\n\nIt\u2019s both an important moment to be remembered, and a movie so cosmically overwrought and forgettable that to contemplate seeing it again in the dark environment of a movie theatre once more is to challenge your eyelids to an existential test of endurance.\n\nIlia is probed, and ultimately killed, by V\u2019Ger. (Image: Paramount)\n\nIt\u2019s why it\u2019s so easy to remember The Motion Picture \u2014 helmed by Robert Wise, who also directed The Sound of Music and West Side Story \u2014 within the context of history and the far better things it would pave the way to.\n\nIts release proved an appetite for more Star Trek that would not just spawn an entire movie franchise beyond it, but lay the ground for Trek\u2019s return to TV in the form of The Next Generation, securing the franchise\u2019s place in pop culture history for the next 40 years (and beyond).\n\nWe get to see the first dramatic steps in a transformation of the Klingons from uncomfortable Orientalist imagery into an intricate, textured culture that would make them one of the most iconic aliens in sci-fi.\n\nIn newcomers Will Decker (Stephen Collins) and Lieutenant Ilia (Persis Khambatta), we get a tiny glimpse of what could have been in the then-simmering plans for what would come to be known as Star Trek: Phase II, the first of many Trek continuations that might have been, and never were.\n\nBecause it\u2019s so much easier to remember those things than what The Motion Picture is actually about: a slow-moving deadly cloud dragging its way towards Earth. The entity at the heart of said space cloud, V\u2019Ger, turns out to be one of Earth\u2019s original Voyager probes, damaged on its deep space mission and fixed up by mysterious cosmic entities, given unfathomable sentience and power but not the power of loooooove.\n\nThe film also features a weirdly curmudgeonly Captain (now Admiral/desk jockey) Kirk, with little of the charm he\u2019s beloved for, bullying his way back into command of the Enterprise to meet the threat. Seemingly endless chit-chat and a cursory sacrifice of both of the film\u2019s intriguing new characters, Ilia and Decker, to teach V\u2019Ger about the human connection later and our bridge crew is back and ready to boldly go where no one has gone before all over again.\n\nOh, and Spock\u2019s trying to purge his emotions and Bones has chest hair.\n\nBones\u2019 disdain for being back aboard a Starfleet vessel is only matched by the bushiness of his beard and chest hair. (Image: Paramount)\n\nThis takes 132 minutes. I cannot stress enough how too long this movie is, too meandering, too indulgent, too everything other than actually interesting.\n\nDespite these fatal flaws, and beneath its languid pacing, The Motion Picture also speaks to the heart of what Star Trek is about; it shows us the grand, haunting, wild and sheer weirdness of space exploration, of encountering the unknown.\n\nPerhaps not quite the boldly going of that iconic opening bit from Kirk that accompanied every episode of Star Trek, perhaps not quite even the where no one has gone before, given that this movie is essentially a remake of the season two episode \u201cThe Changeling\u201d stretched to a breaking point.\n\nBut it still invites us to indulgently revel in the beautiful spectacle of the final frontier, to evoke those feelings of Capital-R-Romantic, exploratory wanderlust. It hopes that we, like its heroes, will spend so many of its lavish special effects sequences \u2014 some more enduring than others, these days \u2014 simply staring in awe as Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s equally awe-inspiring soundtrack blares into your ears.\n\nSpock goes on a trippy journey into the belly of V\u2019Ger. (Image: Paramount)\n\nThere are so many incredible images the film lingers on. The chilling displays of the mysterious cloud eradicating a Klingon scout party in the opening. Spock, heading out alone into the depths of V\u2019Ger\u2019s innards in search of an understanding with it. The slow unveiling of the heart of V\u2019Ger, and the reveal of its true identity.\n\nThose glorious, glorious views of Kirk\u2019s first return approach to the Enterprise via shuttlecraft \u2014 a sequence so delectably hedonistic it almost feels like a Playboy photoshoot for a starship \u2014 that, like the rest of the movie, goes on for a lot longer than it arguably should.\n\nIt\u2019s in these atmospheric moments that The Motion Picture lances through the esoteric dullness of its actual plot to nail what its endless scenes of characters talking and staring at viewscreens never could: space is beautiful, and weird, and petrifying, and alluring, all at once. It\u2019s as captivating as it is cold, as intimate as it is vast and alienating.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s also in these moments of astounding, haunting beauty that the film still cannot escape its paradoxical existence. V\u2019Ger\u2019s presence is full of spectacle and unknown dread, making for all those beautifully evocative shots as the Enterprise begins to explore and probe it, but the reveal of its true identity and its intent comes so late in the film that the unknowing tease simply becomes an infuriating roadblock, one that our heroes managed to solve a third of a way through an episode of TV back when this story was still \u201cThe Changeling.\u201d\n\nEven that iconic, beautiful sequence of Kirk and Scotty\u2019s shuttlecraft making its way towards the drydocked Enterprise, full of fan-tingling nostalgia, thematically clashes with the argument that the film spends most of its time engaging Kirk in \u2014 that he\u2019s no longer at home aboard it, stiffened and turned irascible by his promotion, no longer familiar with the place he most longs to be and rendered aimless by that malaise. Much like The Motion Picture itself.\n\nKirk and Scotty examine the reforged Enterprise. (Image: Paramount)\n\nAnd that really is the rub of this movie, once you peel back the layer of its position in Star Trek\u2019s history. It\u2019s a tight, focused hour of TV, retooled and stretched to a box office grandeur in an attempt to ape Star Wars to the point of narrative incoherence.\n\nIt\u2019s a moody, cerebral drama in a format that craves action, bursting with big ideas it incessantly talks about without ever really acting on them. It\u2019s a nostalgic reunion of a beloved team that treats a good chunk of that team like it doesn\u2019t really want to actually be there.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s incredibly beautiful to the point of indulgence, while somehow also draining the technicolor dream coat aesthetic of its TV forebear into an insipidly dull colour palette (they saved all the colour for the poster, ultimately the greatest thing to come out of Star Trek: The Motion Picture).\n\nThis movie is so incredibly beige \u2014 emotionally and literally, those gorgeous Starfleet uniforms of red, blue, and gold swapped out for pantsuits that come in either shades of deathly pale baby blue or taupe \u2014 it almost hurts, but to even feel that hurt would be too strong a reaction to something that is so bland it\u2019s almost like a black hole of emotion.\n\nYet still, sometimes, just rarely, a tiny crack of something brilliant breaks into escape velocity from that dull void. As the movie comes to an close, V\u2019Ger is dealt with and Kirk is ready to captain the Enterprise on a new mission again. Ilia\u2019s replacement at the helm, Chief DiFalco, asks him for a heading.\n\nKirk doesn\u2019t give her one: instead, with a wave of his hand, a twinkle in his eye, and a wry smile, he simply says \u201cOut there. That-away.\u201d It\u2019s a lovely moment, as we\u2019re treated to one final visual indulgence, a gorgeous shot of the Enterprise soaring into warp speed. Our heroes are back, at last.\n\nIt took him long enough, but Kirk is ready to boldly go once more. (Image: Paramount)\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s weirdly apt summation of the whole endeavour that Star Trek: The Motion Picture takes its entire runtime to finally, finally get there.", "description": "Forty years ago a landmark moment in Star Trek\u2019s history arrived, in the form of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.
