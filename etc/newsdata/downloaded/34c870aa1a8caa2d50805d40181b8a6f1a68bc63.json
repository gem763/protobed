Milano captioned the video, \u201cTake note America. This is what fighting for critical change looks like.\u201d\n\nMilano\u2019s heart is in the right place, but the American policies for which she advocates aren\u2019t similar to the protestors in Hong Kong. They\u2019re more in keeping with their Chinese totalitarian neighbors.\n\nThis column space is beginning to have an alarmingly familiar ring to it, isn\u2019t it? Two weeks ago I wrote about \u201cwoke\u201d Wall Street and big business bowing to the alter of leftist mobs. Wal-Mart just did it again this week with gun sales.\n\nLast week, I wrote about \u201cwoke\u201d comedy and how Dave Chappelle has gone to war against the concept. He\u2019s still being shredded by the left two weeks later for his refusal to cater to the new way of thinking the American left demands.\n\nBut ask yourself: when was the last time you read about a hilarious Chinese stand-up comic? How about trying to find a comedy club in China? I researched this a little bit and discovered the comedians in China \u201ccannot and dare not talk about some hot topics, which are determined by China\u2019s national conditions.\u201d\n\nSincerely, how much different does that sound from todays American left?\n\n\u201cNational conditions?\u201d Chappelle critics literally whined his jokes \u201cdisappointed\u201d them and whined some more that he refuses to adopt \u201cnew perspectives.\u201d As of now, we don\u2019t have a government agency to determine appropriate perspectives through joke telling, but you can certainly hear leftists cheering a politician to create one.\n\nIn the last week alone, Beto O\u2019Rorke has proudly boasted \u2013 despite that pesky Bill of Rights \u2013 his administration would buy back all firearms he deemed unsuitable for use by citizens. Those who wouldn\u2019t willingly sell them back to the government simply \u201cwill not be allowed to keep them.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren was chirping a familiar tune this week discussing her proposed wealth tax. This starts out as an easy sell. Let\u2019s soak the rich and make them pay for all the stuff you\u2019re currently paying for! Not especially new rhetoric. But she\u2019s definitely using a more modern framing of collectivism to sell the pitch.\n\nIt\u2019s a version of President Obama\u2019s \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d riff of a few years ago. The basic gist is if you\u2019re wealthy it\u2019s because you got wealthy using employees who were educated in public schools. You used roads everyone pays for. You rely on cops and firefighters to protect your business that we all pay for. So, pay up you fat cat, Scrooge McDuck, gold bullion hoarding jerk!\n\nAgain, it\u2019s tempting to cheer if you\u2019re having trouble making ends meet. But it\u2019s still authoritarian collectivism It\u2019s the idea \u201cwe\u2019re all in this economy together\u201d and if someone has more than you, they must owe you something to make that inequity right. Further, someone took advantage of you because they use public services they paid for, but you use and pay for them, too and they got rich! You didn\u2019t. So\u2026 you know\u2026 punish someone!\n\nAs an authoritarian, Ms. Warren will then seize all that ill-gotten wealth and she\u2019ll begin spending it on all kinds of things. This is her actual list of promised freebies: universal college, universal pre-K, universal daycare, universal trade schools, raise the wages of all child care workers, and pay off everyone\u2019s existing college debt (college debt alone makes up over a trillion dollars among Americans today).\n\nYep, she\u2019s going to do all of that. But you know what she doesn\u2019t tell you? The quality of everything will collapse. Would you want to take your infant child to President Warren\u2019s government daycare where government employees look after you child all day? Perhaps you do, but I\u2019ve been to the DMV and worked with the IRS and I\u2019m not sold those are good working models for my baby.\n\nA man stood up at a Bernie Sanders rally in South Carolina this week and expressed concern that Sanders\u2019 pledge to eliminate private health insurance and raise everyone\u2019s taxes to pay for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d would actually hurt him, both in his quality of care and his pocketbook.\n\nAnother man at the same rally, a doctor, asked Sanders what his plan would do to \u201cmaintain interest and the pay of physicians so we keep the brightest in the profession.\u201d\n\nTo both men, Senator Sanders flat-out rejected their concerns. Collectivists don\u2019t care about individual concerns. That\u2019s hard to listen to for them. When you\u2019re an authoritarian, you can command everyone be treated exactly the same way and everyone pays exactly the same price and everyone gets the exact same services. In theory.\n\nOutcomes don\u2019t matter. Quality doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter if you like what you currently have. Just shut up and be happy \u201cit\u2019s free\u201d even though I raised your taxes to pay for it, says the authoritarian.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not leave out climate change. This week\u2019s Hurricane Dorian became a new inflection point for collectivists to continue their chants of doing away with everything from eating meat to using air conditioning. Because to save the planet, we\u2019ve all got to do our part, you see? That starts by you doing as you\u2019re told and going without things that make your life easier, better, and in some cases safer.\n\nPeople are dying in massive numbers in Europe due to extreme heat and cold because their government is trying to save the planet. Fossil fuels are their enemy, of course. But so is air conditioning and affordable heat as a consequence.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation of individuals founded on the concept of rugged individualism. Never in our history have we seen a political party so openly embrace and boldly proclaim collectivism as a campaign promise. Sadly, we\u2019ve never had so many Americans cheer it.\n\nAs talk radio host Rush Limbaugh put it, \u201cCollectivist solutions to individual problems is very seductive. It\u2019s how Obama got elected.\u201d How\u2019d that turn out? Eight years of anemic, economic stagnancy and a take over of health insurance that certainly didn\u2019t improve anything or make it cheaper.\n\nAlyssa Milano is right, but she doesn\u2019t know why. They are in the streets of Hong Kong because they desperately want critical change. They want the Chinese government to stop abusing them and give them their freedom as individuals, not ruled as their oppressed, collective Chinese neighbors.\n\nToday\u2019s Democrats don\u2019t embrace what Hong Kong\u2019s citizens are fighting to protect. They embrace the ideology China wishes to inflict.", "description": "Left-wing activist and actress Alyssa Milano tweeted video of hundreds .09/05/2019 0:09:09AM EST.", "authors": ["Chris Stigall", "Beth Baumann", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/168/80c7c01c-a313-4265-a518-f0db32ed98f4.png"}
