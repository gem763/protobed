But Eddie Jones\u2019s side hit back with a vengeance; first through Jonny May\u2019s clinical finish after good work from Anthony Watson and Manu Tuilagi in a sweeping move from right to left.\n\nAnd May was then at the double just two minutes later, capitalising on Henry Slade\u2019s intelligence and craft, collecting his kick to punish David Pocock\u2019s picked-off no-look pass. Marika Koroibete took a chunk out of England\u2019s half-time lead with a devastating burst after the restart, but Kyle Sinckler responded, charging in after profiting from Owen Farrell\u2019s laser-like pass.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

That was the breathless reaction after Marika Koroibete quickly dragged Australia back into this quarter-final at the restart.\n\nDown 17-9 at the break, it was the perfect response from the wing, who can run the 100m in an impressive 10.75.\n\nJordan Petaia\u2019s clever reverse ball infield opened the channel for Koroibete, who ruthlessly surged alongside the chalk and in for the try. It was another magnificent moment from a thrilling game.\n\nA second try was chalked off late on, but that did not deny Koroibete proving himself as one of the game\u2019s most dangerous players.\n\nSinckler keeps cool\n\nOn 63 minutes, Kyle Sinckler shuffled from the pitch, his work done.\n\nAny plan by Australia to target his hair trigger temperament either failed to materialise or simply failed to succeed: instead Sinckler kept his discipline, conceding only one penalty in an industrious hour that saw him dish out eight tackles and carry 17 metres.\n\nMost important of those was the crucial 10 or so that brought England their third try, and ultimately took this quarter-final away from the Wallabies.", "description": "Jonny May struck twice to inspire\u00a0England\u00a0past rivals\u00a0Australia\u00a0and into the\u00a0World Cup\u00a0semi-finals.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn", "Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/19/09/Jonny-May-scores-for-England-in-Oita.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
