He has shown a willingness to overturn precedent and an impatience with more reticent colleagues.\n\nMore than anything, he has displayed a supreme confidence that his originalist approach to the law is the most disciplined and principled way to go about his job as a justice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all in, and I wanted to explain that,\u201d Gorsuch said in a recent interview in his chambers. He was referring to \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It,\u201d a book he has written that goes on sale Tuesday. The title is from Benjamin Franklin\u2019s reported comment when asked what kind of government the Founding Fathers would propose.\n\nIt is a collection of essays, speeches, past opinions and ruminations on civics, civility and the art of judging.\n\n\u201cI decided I wanted to say something about the Constitution, the separation of powers and the judge\u2019s role in it,\u201d Gorsuch said in the interview. At his confirmation in 2017, he said, \u201cI was surprised by just some basic misunderstandings about the separation of powers.\u201d\n\n(In the interview, which happened to fall on his 52nd birthday, Gorsuch was unwilling to discuss the way the Senate goes about evaluating Supreme Court nominees. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make me relive the confirmation process are you?\u201d he said in response to a question. \u201cOn my birthday?\u201d)\n\nImmediate impact: Gorsuch can play key role early\n\nThose who follow the court, on the left and the right, do not need a book to evaluate how Gorsuch has filled his role as the replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s everything conservatives hoped for and liberals feared,\u201d said Erwin Chemerinsky, the liberal dean of the law school at the University of California at Berkeley. He recently wrote a detailed evaluation of Gorsuch\u2019s jurisprudence for ABA Journal.\n\nGregory Garre, who was solicitor general under President George W. Bush, said that Gorsuch is much like a concentrated version of Scalia, right down to his \u201cmaverick\u201d tendencies to join the court\u2019s liberals on some criminal justice issues.\n\n\u201cIn a 2016 tribute to Justice Scalia, then-Judge Gorsuch described Justice Scalia as \u2018docile in private life but a ferocious fighter when at work,\u2019 \u201d Garre said. \u201cMuch the same could be said about Justice Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nOne difference, according to Garre: \u201cArguably, he\u2019s been more open to rethinking long-standing constitutional doctrine. . . . In this regard, he\u2019s closer to Justice [Clarence] Thomas, who, even when Justice Scalia was on the court, often found himself writing alone on such matters.\u201d\n\nGorsuch and Kavanaugh move the court to the right but often disagree\n\nRespecting the court\u2019s precedents \u2014 \u201cstare decisis,\u201d it is called \u2014 is a pledge that senators of both parties try to extract from Supreme Court nominees. Republicans want to preserve rulings respecting the Second Amendment; Democrats worry about eroding the right to abortion or the protection of same-sex marriage.\n\nAccording to Adam Feldman, who analyzes the court for his website Empirical SCOTUS, Gorsuch has voted to overturn or suggested revisiting 11 of the court\u2019s precedents in his two terms on the court.\n\nGorsuch, in the interview, denied that made him much different from any other justice.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019d all agree that precedent is very important,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t inexorable.\u201d\n\nAs he writes in the book, Gorsuch said a justice must look at how a decision comports with the \u201coriginal meaning\u201d of the Constitution, how well reasoned the decision was at the time, how long it has been relied upon, how many other justices have questioned it.\n\n\u201cGoodness gracious, this court is as modest and as conservative as any in our history\u201d about overturning precedent, Gorsuch said.\n\nBut if a litigant requests the court consider overturning a precedent, \u201cI have to listen,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd once in a while I\u2019m going to be persuaded. It\u2019s not going to be that often. But it\u2019s going to happen once in a while.\u201d\n\nGorsuch voted with fellow conservatives to overturn a 40-year-old precedent involving the way public employee unions can collect collective-bargaining fees. And he advocated, along with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, uprooting a precedent that allows local and federal prosecution for the same offense.\n\nIn a case last term that allowed a 40-foot cross to stand on public land as a memorial to World War I veterans, Gorsuch and Thomas went further than the majority to advocate finally ditching the test the court has set for deciding when a public display constitutes government endorsement of religion. Along with it, he said, should go the ability of \u201coffended observers\u201d to challenge such displays in court.\n\nThere are few references to current controversies in the book, and in the interview Gorsuch was adamant about not commenting on cases that could come before the court or opining about the man who nominated him.\n\nTrump reportedly considered rescinding Gorsuch nomination\n\nFor instance, in the book and in the interview, Gorsuch lavishly praised federal judges who \u201cbelieve the Constitution is the greatest charter of human liberty that history\u2019s ever known. And they believe in this country, they believe it\u2019s more important than their own financial feathering of their nests.\u201d\n\nBut asked about Trump\u2019s frequent charge of bias against judges who have ruled against him or his policies, Gorsuch balked. \u201cThey can do their thing in the political arena. I\u2019m a judge. And I\u2019m going to stick to my lane,\u201d the justice said. \u201cYou asked about what I think of judges in this country. I already talked about that, all right? Insert that answer here.\u201d\n\nFar from the candid coming-of-age memoirs of Thomas and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Gorsuch\u2019s book has chapters such as \u201cOur Constitution and Its Separated Powers\u201d and \u201cThe Judge\u2019s Tools.\u201d It is in the latter that he defends his view of originalism \u2014 \u201cthe Constitution should be read in our time the same way it was read when adopted\u201d \u2014 and the textualist view of statutory interpretation.\n\nSuch a practice eschews trying to divine the legislature\u2019s intent in passing a law and \u201ctasks judges with discerning (only) what an ordinary English speaker familiar with the law\u2019s usages would have understood the statutory text to mean at the time of its enactment.\u201d\n\nSuch pronouncements fit in a book trying to explain how a judge works. But when Gorsuch first joined the court, they seemed to grate on his more experienced colleagues when he extolled them at oral argument. More than one issued a rebuke.\n\nBut the court has a way of coming together. \u201cThis is a group of people who respect, admire, cherish one another, I think, on a daily basis,\u201d Gorsuch said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special little place.\u201d\n\nSotomayor, Gorsuch\u2019s liberal seatmate when the court hears oral arguments, has described him as a \u201clovely\u201d person with whom she has decided to agreeably disagree. Ginsburg, one of those who seemed put off early on by the new justice, now tells audiences that she assigned two majority opinions to Gorsuch in the past term when he sided with the court\u2019s liberals.\n\nGinsburg, famous for her octogenarian workouts, also says Gorsuch is probably the court\u2019s fittest justice: He often makes an hour-and-a-quarter commute to work \u2014 each way \u2014 on his bicycle.\n\nDespite their lifetime appointments, justices share a sense of fleeting fame. That is probably how it should be, Gorsuch said. But his worry is that Americans do not understand the structure of government and its institutions.\n\n\u201cOnly about a third of Americans can identify the three branches,\u201d Gorsuch said. \u201cAnother third can only name one branch of government. Ten percent thinks Judy Sheindlin serves on the United States Supreme Court. Judge Judy!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019ve got great respect for her, but she is not one of my colleagues.\u201d", "description": "In a new book and interview, the Supreme Court justice discusses his strong views on the law and the art of judging", "authors": ["Robert Barnes", "Reporter Covering The U.S. Supreme Court", "Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IZKMPIWKUQI6TFQVR4NDFFROAQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
