Other missing horses are presumed dead.\n\nWILD HORSES OF NORTH CAROLINA TO RIDE OUT HURRICANE WITH 'BUTTS TO THE WIND'\n\n\u201cIt was a mini tsunami,\u201d herd manager Woody Hancock said, according to The Observer. \u201cThe horses normally see the water start to rise in a storm and migrate to higher ground, but they just didn\u2019t have time. The shift in the wind happened too fast and they were taken off guard and washed off the island.\"\n\nHe said people who have lived on the island their whole life said they had never seen anything like Dorian.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a normal hurricane. Areas that normally flood didn\u2019t see flooding, and spots that never get it were devastated,\u201d he said. The horses \u201cdidn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\n\nThe hurricane hit the Outer Banks on Sept. 6 as a Category 1 with winds at nearly 100 mph.\n\nThe 28 horses make up more than half of the island\u2019s 49-horse herd. They were identified by their branding.\n\nThe herd roams freely on 1,000 acres of private land on the island.\n\nSome of the surviving horses managed to swim to nearby islands, the Observer reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis has really affected everybody on the island,\u201d Hancock said, according to The Observer. \u201cAll the horses were named after local people on the island and so every family felt a connection to the herd.\"", "description": "A \u201cmini tsunami\u201d during Hurricane Dorian dragged 28 wild horses in North Carolina to their deaths earlier this month, according to reports.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/wild-horses-north-carolina-iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
