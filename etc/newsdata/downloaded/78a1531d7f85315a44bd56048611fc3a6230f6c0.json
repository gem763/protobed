The right-hander did not walk a batter while throwing 107 pitches, and he also contributed an RBI single at the plate.\n\n\u201cI was able to sit down for part of the game and watch him,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what he\u2019s done this year. He\u2019s fun to watch. You\u2019ve still got to manage the game, but he\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d\n\nStrasburg picked up his 12th straight win against the Marlins dating to 2015. He improved to 4-0 with a 1.19 ERA against Miami this season and 21-7 with a 2.74 ERA in 35 career starts.\n\n\u201cFastball command was pretty good,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cI was able to throw my curveball for a strike when I wanted to and changeup was pretty good as well.\u201d\n\nJuan Soto and Kurt Suzuki also homered for the NL wild card leaders, who have won three straight and eight of nine after completing a 19-7 August.\n\nThe Marlins extended the franchise record with their 14th consecutive road loss.\n\nMiami\u2019s Pablo L\u00f3pez (5-7), making his second start since returning from a strained right shoulder that kept him out for more than two months, allowed six runs and six hits in three innings.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I would get in good counts - 0-2, 1-2 - but it was getting that quality pitch up or down in the zone. I wasn\u2019t able to execute it,\u201d L\u00f3pez said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything working other than your fastball, and if you can\u2019t locate your fastball very well, then you run into some problems like I did tonight.\u201d\n\nRendon, who hit a game-ending single during Friday night\u2019s 7-6 victory over Miami, opened the scoring with his 30th homer with two out in the first.\n\nThe 20-year-old Soto followed with his 30th homer, another shot to left.\n\n\u201cThey work really good at-bats and they can beat you in many ways,\u201d Martinez said of Rendon and Soto. \u201cThey both hit the long ball, but they both hit doubles, they both go the other way. They can take their walks.\u201d\n\nStrasburg singled in Suzuki in the second, and Suzuki\u2019s two-run homer in Washington\u2019s three-run third made it 6-0.\n\nRendon added a solo shot in the eighth for his third multihomer game of the season.\n\nBASH BROTHERS\n\nRendon and Soto are the first Nationals teammates to each hit 30 homers in the same season since Adam Dunn (38) and Ryan Zimmerman (33) in 2009.\n\nSELECT COMPANY\n\nAccording to the Nationals, Soto became the seventh player in major league history to hit least 30 home runs in his age 20 season, joining Mike Trout (30 in 2012); \u00c1lex Rodr\u00edguez (36 in 1996); Tony Conigliaro (32 in 1965); Frank Robinson (38 in 1956); Ted Williams (31 in 1939) and Mel Ott (42 in 1929).\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nMarlins: RHP Tayron Guerrero (torn fingernail, right middle finger) has joined the team. Manager Don Mattingly said he\u2019ll be activated soon.\n\nNationals: RF Adam Eaton, who was hit below the right knee by a pitch on Wednesday, was again out of the lineup but available off the bench. \u2026 Closer Sean Doolittle (right knee tendinitis) and 1B Ryan Zimmerman (plantar fasciitis) are expected to be activated when the rosters expand on Sunday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMarlins: LHP Caleb Smith (8-8, 4.05 ERA) has allowed five or more runs in consecutive starts for the first time in his career. He\u2019s 1-1 with a 6.00 ERA in two career starts against Washington, both this season.\n\nNationals: LHP Patrick Corbin (10-6, 3.15 ERA) is 2-0 with a 0.78 ERA in three starts against the Marlins this season, including a four-hit shutout on May 25.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In the middle of a pennant race, Stephen Strasburg gave his manager a chance to relax.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Harvey Valentine"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/marlins_nationals_baseball_19207_c0-164-3933-2457_s1770x1032.jpg?c296ddfbff7ed6a89ad5a19de7042041eb19e6a6"}
