Engineers then record the trust levels in the 500 test pedestrians before and after \"eye contact\" is made to discover if people have enough confidence in whether the car will stop for them.\n\nStudies have shown that 63% of pedestrians and cyclists say they'd feel less safe with autonomous vehicles on the road, according to the carmakers. Jaguar Land Rover hopes that the research will provide insight into how much \"information\" self-driving cars should share to increase trust in the vehicles.\n\nThe project plays off of the \"second-nature\" urge that pedestrians have when looking at the driver of a car before stepping out into the road.\n\n\"Understanding how this translates in tomorrow's more automated world is important,\" a research manager at Jaguar Land Rover's Future Mobility project, Pete Bennett, said in a prepared statement.\n\n\"We want to know if it is beneficial to provide humans with information about a vehicle's intentions or whether simply letting a pedestrian know it has been recognized is enough to improve confidence.\"\n\nCheck out the \"eyes\" that have engineers and cognitive psychologists working together:\n\nJaguar Land Rover put the \u201cvirtual eyes\u201d on its self-driving pods to interact with pedestrians on the road.\n\nIt makes eye contact with pedestrians to \u201csignal intent.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ceyes\u201d are a combination of work between engineers and cognitive psychologists to research human trust in autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe pods run on a test street set and the behaviour of pedestrians waiting to cross the road is analysed.\n\nEngineers record trust levels before and after \u201ceye contact\u201d is made with the pod.\n\nStudies have shown that 63% of pedestrians and cyclists say they\u2019d feel less safe with autonomous vehicles on the road.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s second-nature to glance at the driver of the approaching vehicle before stepping into the road,\u201d Bennett said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnderstanding how this translates in tomorrow\u2019s more automated world is important.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to know if it is beneficial to provide humans with information about a vehicle\u2019s intentions or whether simply letting a pedestrian know it has been recognised is enough to improve confidence.\u201d", "description": "Jaguar Land Rover put eyes on its self-driving pods to see just how trust humans have in autonomous vehicles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9410/ab2223d1739a474aa2a729bd9004bbad.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
