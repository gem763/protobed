But new research from the University of East Anglia, published in The Lancet: Infectious Diseases, finds that people not washing their hands may be a leading cause in the spread of E coli in the UK.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about E coli,\u201d says Prof David Livermore, who led the research. \u201cWe all have harmless E coli that live in our gut. Additionally there are some strains that can cause diarrheal diseases, ranging from the mild to the severe. These aren\u2019t associated with poor kitchen hygiene and food preparation \u2026 what we\u2019ve shown is that the antibiotic-resistant strains of E coli that cause bloodstream infections \u2013 the ones that are difficult to treat \u2013 are the ones that are often found in people\u2019s guts. So people are carrying this E coli about.\u201d\n\nNot washing your hands properly after going to the toilet can have serious health consequences. \u201cE coli is the biggest single cause of bacterial bloodstream infections in the UK,\u201d he says. Those who have compromised immune systems are particularly at risk. Livermore urges people working in care homes or who visit hospitals to take great care washing their hands.\n\nBut how best to protect yourself from E coli? Wash your hands properly. \u201cWhen you wash your hands with soap, what the soap does is to detach the microbes from your hands, but the microbes remain alive,\u201d says Prof Sally Bloomfield of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe important part of washing your hands is rinsing them. That\u2019s what takes the microbes off your hands.\u201d\n\nHow to wash your hands properly Read more\n\nUse plenty of soap and be vigorous. \u201cRub them for at least 15 seconds, making sure that you rub them properly, from palm to palm, as well as rubbing the back of your hands. Interlace your fingers and rub them together. Rub around the backs of each of your fingers and thumbs,\u201d Bloomfield says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to mechanically detach all of the organisms from your hands.\u201d\n\nAfter rinsing, dry your hands thoroughly to remove any microbes left lurking behind. (Be sure to change your hand towels regularly \u2013 every few days, or every day if you have children \u2013 on a hot wash of 60C or more to kill bacteria.)\n\nIf you\u2019re not able to wash your hands using soap and running water, Bloomfield recommends using antibacterial hand gel to kill any microbes on your hands. Keep one in your bag and use it when you\u2019re not able to get to a bathroom \u2013 on a plane or at a festival. It\u2019s not as good as soap and water, but it\u2019s near enough.\n\nAnd if all of this sounds like a chore, buy some fancy soap to make the whole process that bit nicer.
