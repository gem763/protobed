At the time, the industrial sector had abandoned SoHo and the neighborhood\u2019s commercial lofts were turning over into work/live spaces for poor artists.\n\nThis gritty version of SoHo\u2014which would be unrecognizable to the shoppers who flock to its posh boutiques today\u2014was where Goldman Srebnick and her brother grew up and began working in their father\u2019s restaurants; first Greene Street Caf\u00e9, a garbage-truck garage their father turned into a jazz supper club, and later, Soho Kitchen and Bar, which he launched out of a former metal-cabinet factory.\n\nGoldman, who died in 2012, began buying up buildings in Miami\u2019s neglected Wynwood area in the \u201980s, planting the seeds for what would grow into the sprawling, colorful Wynwood Walls arts district that now draws millions of Instagramming visitors each year. With Goldman Srebnick now at the helm, the walls will celebrate their 10th anniversary in December with the release of a retrospective photo book and a slate of events at Art Basel in Miami.\n\nGoldman Srebnick, 49, officially entered the family business at age 27, after spending her post-college years as an associate fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue. Goldman named her CEO in 2012, shortly before his death. Today, Goldman Srebnick oversees a diverse portfolio of restaurants, office buildings, a boutique hotel, commercial and retail properties, and large-scale public art projects including the Wynwood Walls and the iconic Houston Bowery wall in New York.\n\n\u201cI feel really privileged that I get to do that because it keeps me close to my dad, and it\u2019s a great reminder of what our family legacy is and what I wish for it to continue to be,\u201d she said.\n\nGoldman Srebnick works alongside her brother, Joey Goldman, a partner, and their mother, Janet Goldman, who serves as chairwoman and principal of the company.\n\nIn 2015, she founded Goldman Global Arts, a Miami- and New York-based creative collective with co-founder and artist Peter Tunney.\n\nWhen she\u2019s not vetting new commercial tenants or scoping out the next talented artist to grace the walls, Goldman Srebnick can be found hanging out at home in Miami with her husband, Scott, and their three sons, ages 12, 14, and 16. During some rare downtime, she jumped on the phone with Penta to talk about how she stays current on leadership strategies and how her father\u2019s life lessons stick with her.\n\nMy favorite neighborhood in the world is\u2026 Wynwood, Miami. It\u2019s by far the most artistic neighborhood in the country and the more I travel, the more I realize how special it is. It\u2019s literally an open-air museum of the streets with the greatest concentration of street art in the world. For me what\u2019s more exciting is that there\u2019s still so much more growth and opportunity ahead for Wynwood. It\u2019s definitely a neighborhood that everyone should be watching, visiting, and participating in.\n\nThe one thing in my kitchen I can\u2019t live without is\u2026 my juicer, because I\u2019m addicted to watermelon juice. It\u2019s the best thing ever. Sometimes, I add a little mint. It\u2019s an anytime staple. And I can\u2019t get it all the time, because it\u2019s not always watermelon season, so when it is in season, I\u2019m all about it.\n\nThe best book I\u2019ve read in the last year is\u2026 I read Harvard Business School case studies on lots of different topics\u2014leading in times of crisis, differentiating yourself in business, best practices in hiring, for example. The world is changing all the time, and it\u2019s important to be current in how you\u2019re creating culture in an organization or best practices with human resources, or understanding how technology affects growth.\n\nIf I were to buy a piece of art, it would be by\u2026 (laughs) that\u2019s like asking me if I have a favorite child. I\u2019m always buying art and it\u2019s somewhat like an addiction. And part of my job is discovering incredible talent. The most current piece that I bought is by Kobra, a Brazilian street artist. It\u2019s part of a very small handful of canvases that the artist has ever done, so it makes it that much more special. What I find to be so incredible [about artists like Kobra] is that they can work on a really large scale and then they can transition into a smaller scale. That\u2019s why we opened the Goldman Global Arts Gallery\u2014to be able to provide artwork in the genre of street art to collectors.\n\nA passion of mine that few people know about is\u2026 it\u2019s not that people don\u2019t know\u2014they do\u2014but my passion is my family. It\u2019s really for me what matters most in the world. And maybe what some people might not know about me is that I\u2019ve never been a dog person and we recently got a dog and I\u2019m in love with my dog! He\u2019s a Golden Doodle, and his name is Csonka, like the (retired) football player Larry Csonka. I live in a household of four men, so there\u2019s a lot of sports talk in my house. But we\u2019re all actually big-time football fans. I\u2019m also one of the co-chairs of the Super Bowl host committee; the Super Bowl is coming to Miami in 2020.\n\nThe one trip I\u2019ve taken that I would love to do again\u2026 safari in Africa. We were there two years ago, in Tanzania. It was absolutely life-changing. We did it with our kids and we can\u2019t wait to go back, all of us, and explore more of that magnificent continent. It was breathtaking.\n\nThe restaurant in my hometown that I would love to take a visitor to is\u2026 Joey\u2019s, which is one of our [Goldman Properties\u2019] restaurants. It\u2019s one of the best Italian restaurants in town, and it\u2019s part of the Wynwood Walls experience\u2014you go sit outside in the garden at Joey\u2019s, have an amazing pizza or pasta and then you go for a walk in the Wynwood Walls. It\u2019s a perfect afternoon.\n\nThe thing that gets me up in the morning is\u2026 the opportunity to make a difference every day. On a recent weekend, my family and I volunteered at Style Saves, an organization started by friends of mine, David and Isabela Grutman. It provides school supplies, backpacks, haircuts, and uniforms to thousands of kids in Florida.\n\nIf I could have a drink with anybody, anywhere, it would be\u2026 with my dad, for sure. I miss talking to him, and I miss hearing about his wild and wonderful ideas. We would have the drink some place big and beautiful, whether it\u2019s on a mountaintop or on the beach, looking at the water. Nature is a form of art\u2014he and my mom taught me to look at things that way, with optimism and gratitude and wonder. He taught me to look at the world with wonder, so we\u2019d have to find a really wonderful place to have our drink. I don\u2019t drink, so I\u2019d have something super healthy and sweet, like watermelon juice. And he\u2019d have a glass of Scotch.", "description": "Miami\u2019s Wynwood neighborhood, her juicer, and Harvard Business School case studies for light reading", "authors": ["Mareesa Nicosia"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113040/social"}
