It was the slowest pace for such sales in the month of July since 2009.\n\nWhen residential sales accelerated in June, some brokers said the rush to beat the tax could trigger a broader sales rebound, as buyers who had been hesitating for many months could decide to buy. The market had been weakening for several years.\n\nThe new July sales figures cast doubt on that idea and suggest the tax surge simply sped up sales that would have happened anyway. \u201cConsumer behavior is modified by tax-policy change, and this is exactly what we are seeing,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, an appraiser and market analyst.\n\nMr. Miller said that the July slump may actually be overstating the pace of the slowdown\u2014which he says may be nearing a bottom\u2014after steep price cuts last year.\n\nThe new transfer tax\u2014a one-time payment on any property selling for at least $2 million ranges from 0.25%, or $5,000, on a $2 million sale, to 3.15% on sales of $25 million or more\u2014triggered a rush to close. The result: Records were set for the most sales above $2 million, above $10 million and even above $25 million.\n\nJuly represented a reversal, the Journal analysis found. There were 162 sales for $2 million or more in July, 62% of average monthly sales over the last decade. That compares with 685 in June. Total Manhattan sales fell from a record $4.9 billion to just under $1.54 billion, the lowest July total since 2009 and the lowest month overall since 2013.\n\nThe new Hudson Yards real-estate development in Manhattan.

That was down 40% from the figure in June, which was pushed up by the many high-end sales.\n\nAt the same time, sales below $2 million, which weren\u2019t subject to the new tax, chugged along at a steady pace. These sales were up 2.5% from June and were the largest July total since 2015. The analysis includes sales filed through Aug. 31.\n\nDonna Olshan, a broker who tracks the luxury market, said the slowdown has continued. She said the number of contracts signed for properties listed for $4 million or more fell 17% this year through August, including a steep decline this month.\n\nShe attributed much of the slowdown to the long-term effects of another change in taxation that increased the cost of owning real estate: federal limits placed on the deductibility of state and local taxes, including on New York\u2019s relatively high property taxes. The new limits took effect in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe crisis seems to be going sideways,\u201d she said. Sellers who lower their prices are doing deals, she said, while other listings sit on the market. Many condo developers aren\u2019t lowering prices, but they are telling brokers to \u201c\u2018just make me an offer,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThere were 12 transactions for $10 million or more in July, a below-average month, and the lowest monthly total since 2015. The biggest was the $65.75 million purchase of a penthouse at a new condominium at 220 Central Park South by the Gordon M. Sumner, better known as the musician Sting.\n\nBut Sting\u2019s 5,845 square foot four-story apartment wasn\u2019t hit by the new tax, since he went into contract on it in June 2016.\n\nThe new tax rates took effect on July 1 for most transactions, but the state grandfathered in sales that were in contract by the start of the state\u2019s fiscal year on April 1 at the old rates.\n\nAll but one of the $10 million-plus transactions, including eight sales in new developments, were exempt from the new tax.\n\nThe only one hit by the tax was the purchase of a three-bedroom co-op by Georgina Bloomberg, a daughter of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. She paid $10.2 million for an apartment on the 12th floor of 101 Central Park West, a building where she already has a home. She paid an extra $229,400 in taxes because of the higher rates, according to property records.\n\nWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "description": "Sales of Manhattan homes and apartments for $2 million or more in July shrank to the lowest level for any month in seven years as a new transfer tax went into effect.", "authors": ["Josh Barbanel"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103006/social"}
