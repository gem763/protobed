It\u2019s also not necessarily what viewers might expect based on its creators, director Daniel Scheinert and his longtime friend and collaborator, screenwriter Billy Chew. As half of the writing-directing team Daniels, Scheinert has been involved in a lot of giddy mayhem, from colorful music videos (most notably for Lil Jon\u2019s \u201cTurn Down for What\u201d) to bizarre, exciting short films. They\u2019ve created complicated experiments in interactive cinema, and they made their feature-film debut with Swiss Army Man, a strangely tender movie about a shipwrecked man who survives with the help of Daniel Radcliffe\u2019s aggressively farting corpse.\n\nSo it\u2019s surprising how empathetic and personal The Death of Dick Long is, for a noir crime comedy about a man who dies with mysterious anal injuries, leaving his friends to frantically cover up the circumstances. Set in Scheinert\u2019s native South, it\u2019s sympathetic toward the hapless bros who witness the death of Dick Long (played by Scheinert, though he tried to get Channing Tatum for the role) and turn it into an even bigger, more darkly comedic disaster than it already is. I sat down with Scheinert at Austin\u2019s Fantastic Fest, where the movie premiered, to discuss the film\u2019s thoughts on fragile masculinity, the bro code, dodging Southern stereotypes, trying to stunt-cast a dead guy, creating empathy for Nickelback, and butts. Especially butts.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhy are the Daniels so into stories centering around butts? I\u2019m thinking about Interesting Ball and Swiss Army Man, and it\u2019s relevant again here in The Death of Dick Long.\n\n[Laughs] I don\u2019t know! Something about lowbrow and highbrow at the same time is my favorite comedy, and anything about bodily functions is universal. Everyone across the globe is born with a butt. Fifty percent of them have vaginas, and that\u2019s funny, and 50 percent of them have weiners, and that\u2019s funny. Dan and I joke about which bodily functions we haven\u2019t made movies about. Like, we\u2019ve made a movie about barfing, but not burping, and pooping and peeing.\n\nAre you working from a checklist? Do you need to get to belching soon?\n\nI guess so! Another real answer is that for Dan and I discovered that for music videos, if you want to tell a visual story, you go for physical comedy. Bodily functions resonate with people, and with us, and make us laugh. They help us explore the human experience. Bodies are weird.\n\nAt the same time, Dick Long doesn\u2019t track primarily as a comedy. There\u2019s a lot of emotional drama, and a lot of time spent in the heads of people in very sad, uncomfortable places. Is it harder to mesh that kind of lowbrow bodily humor with serious drama?\n\nNo, that\u2019s my favorite, dramas that make me laugh, or comedies that make me sad. Billy wrote a script that gave me permission to have fun and make jokes, as long as it wasn\u2019t at the expense of the characters. Dick dies under a farcical set of circumstances, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to have fun. But you\u2019re right, it was also an opportunity to do some three-dimensional scene work with actors. Huge chunks of the film just focus on the reality of these bizarre circumstances.\n\nSo you\u2019re from Alabama, and Billy isn\u2019t, but he spent some time there, and you\u2019ve said he was sending you messages like, \u201cYour home state is fascinating.\u201d How did he end up there?\n\nAfter college, he moved there. His ex-girlfriend lived there, and he went and lived with her and her parents for a while. They discussed it, and they didn\u2019t want to go straight from college to the big city. It didn\u2019t feel particularly right or fun to them. He got really excited about going somewhere specific and weird and interesting, and learning about the world. So their plan was, \u201cLet\u2019s go to Alabama for a few years and figure out exactly where we want to go next, and what we want to do next.\u201d And they lived there for three or four years.\n\nWhat kind of perspective did he give you about Alabama?\n\nI respect him a lot. He\u2019s a smart, interesting guy. So I thought he\u2019d be bored. But then he would tell me the stories he\u2019d read in the local paper, or heard around town, or who worked at Panera with him. They would remind me of people I grew up around, but it blew my mind that he thought it was so interesting. A lot of people grow up in the South and claim to have Southern pride, but actually have Southern shame. Like, \u201cWhere I\u2019m from is boring. Nobody cares about little me living here in this silly state.\u201d He was finding out things I loved and knew, but thought wouldn\u2019t interest other people. And now I realize that\u2019s not true. And it\u2019s something I have to offer. I come from somewhere specific, and not many filmmakers are from there. So I can use that until the rest of the world catches on and starts hiring people from Birmingham, until there are like 20 of us.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about making this as a response to movies like The Hangover, bro comedies about male bonding over terrible behavior. Why was that important to you?\n\nI love those movies, but I\u2019m ashamed of loving those movies because the things the characters do have no consequences. Some of the people enabled by those stories are my least favorite people in the world. I love Jackass and The Hangover, but I thought this was an opportunity to explore man-children and add in some real repercussions. What\u2019s it like keeping secrets? What toll does it take psychologically? They brush over that in The Hangover, the secret they all keep. \u201cBro, we\u2019re not gonna tell anyone what happened last night\u201d is a terrible way to start a marriage. It\u2019s a tragic movie! In the end, he marries her, and his friends are all, like, \u201cWe\u2019re never telling anyone!\u201d I was like, \u201cFuck, that\u2019s a sad, sad metaphor for nuclear families across America.\u201d [Laughs]\n\nThis movie is so much about that kind of masculinity, about the macho code of \u201cWe will never speak of our emotions, and we\u2019ll police each other constantly for any sign of weakness.\u201d How did you want to approach that idea?\n\nI approached it just as a fan of the script. I tried to find the most interesting actors, and talk with them about what felt truthful. I didn\u2019t want to do a reductive satire. I wanted to make something that would resonate with these kinds of guys, something they would enjoy. So we approached it honestly, and found all of us have a lot in common with these characters. Not extremely specifically, but we\u2019ve all bottled shit up or had a week where we don\u2019t want to admit to a significant other or parents or ourselves what we\u2019re going through because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do.\n\nThere are big comedic elements to the movie, especially in some of the dumber decisions the characters make. But you don\u2019t want them to come across as stupid or laughable. How did you approach that with the actors?\n\nWe would look for variations in each scene, in how to play it, but we were always looking to find humor in the situations, as long as we were grounded in reality. I wanted the movie to never not be funny for longer than a couple minutes, so people wouldn\u2019t forget the film had been silly for the first half. But I also think that\u2019s accurate to real life. When people are sad, and their marriages are falling apart, they\u2019re a mess. They fall down the stairs, they misspeak, they stutter. But in movies, people are so articulate, and they hit their mark. I find it unrelatable when people are going through tragedy and they look great, and they\u2019re standing in perfect light and giving speeches. When I\u2019ve gone through hard periods of my life, I\u2019m ridiculous. So it felt like, in a way, the comedy was another way of chasing authenticity. Because real life\u2019s funny.\n\nThere\u2019s so much sensitivity right now about anything that seems to examine what it means to be a straight white dude, especially if there\u2019s any hint of criticism or critique. Even acknowledging that there\u2019s a culture there makes some people uncomfortable and angry. Did you have to contend with that, or have you been seeing that kind of reaction?\n\nA little. And then my brain just went in the opposite direction. There\u2019s a culture of people just wanting to really dunk on straight white man culture in a way that feels unhelpful. For alt-right bros to refuse to self-examine, or admit that maybe something\u2019s wrong with their outlook, is dangerous and bad and terrible. Gamergate and that kind of culture is about building up walls, creating a siloed-off culture. But there\u2019s also the opposite siloed-off culture of people who want to break down the patriarchy and can\u2019t admit that the guys are just their neighbors. One of the things I love about Billy is that when he writes, he has all this stuff in the back of his mind, but he tries to go into the gray of the world and have a ton of fun there, and have things to say without creating a preachy, preachy sermon. People these days often really want to stick to extremes, but I don\u2019t. I think movies are more fun when they\u2019re an exercise in empathy.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about the challenge of creating empathy for weird things, like getting people to connect emotionally to a farting corpse. Or in this case, to\u2014\n\nTo Nickelback!\n\nWhy is that an urge for you?\n\nMy favorite films do that to me, so I aspire to do that to another audience member somewhere. I want to make people have an emotional reaction they didn\u2019t expect, or didn\u2019t think they could have. It doesn\u2019t blow my mind if a movie makes me sad when the dog dies. But it blew my mind how the end of Midsommar gave me an emotional, spiritual experience. And it shouldn\u2019t have. It\u2019s supposed to be fucked-up. I love that, getting persuaded to empathize with culty murderers. And it\u2019s a fun process as a filmmaker to remind myself that empathy is the end goal because then every choice you make is just you understanding some humans. What are they like? What are they up to? As opposed to moving them around as pawns.\n\nIs it true that you pursued a lot of stunt casting for Dick Long himself?\n\nYeah, we actually reached out to Channing Tatum and Justin Timberlake\u2019s PR teams. And I feel bad in retrospect. I\u2019m so lucky to be in a position where I can reach out to people like that, but this was a pretty mean role to offer someone. [Laughs] Especially now that I\u2019ve played the role. It would have been miserable. I mean, it was fun. Dick gets to shoot fireworks and guns, but then he gets dragged around and dropped on concrete and covered in fake blood for a long time. They wouldn\u2019t have had much fun. But I think Justin Timberlake\u2019s team \u2014 we got in touch with his agents, and they were like, \u201cWe\u2019re not even showing this to him.\u201d Which has never happened to me, where an agent was like, \u201cNo. Hard pass. We\u2019re not even telling Justin.\u201d Maybe they were afraid he\u2019d say yes, and they censored him!\n\nWhat would you do if Channing Tatum or Justin Timberlake approached you at a film festival and said \u201cI can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t tell me about this role. I wish I\u2019d been Dick Long!\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be like, \u201cLet\u2019s do another one! Next time! I\u2019ll find a role for you!\u201d But I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t work out. I love that nobody in this film is a celebrity, like a big, super-distracting, famous face. Because there\u2019s a whole genre of indie film that makes me feel like I just went into a small-town world, and I hope this movie\u2019s like that, like a window into a community. Like Beasts of the Southern Wild, or Moonlight. Sundance has like 10 indies every year that are like, \u201cHere are 10 super-celebrities playing a small-town Arkansas family.\u201d Like Kings of Summer. It\u2019s a good movie, but everybody\u2019s parents are so famous in that movie, it kind of distracted me. And this isn\u2019t that.\n\nWhy was Dick Long a solo project rather than a Daniels film? Are you guys planning on doing a series of separate projects?\n\nDan and I are constantly figuring out our process, and trying to make our working relationship healthy. So it just felt right at the time. We have tons more work that we want to make together. This one \u2014 Kwan and I had been outlining our new movie together, and then he sat and wrote a draft while I made this movie. That was an experiment in our writing process because I could be a pretty impatient writer. This time I said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re going to have three or four months, and I\u2019ll be around to talk, and then I\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll make the movie this winter.\u201d That was two years ago. [Laughs] Like, six drafts later\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been good for us. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to solo direct a lot, but we have been learning that giving each other some space is really fun. With a music video, doing everything together makes sense. But with features, some space is nice because we can surprise each other. \u201cOkay, you did a draft, made some discoveries, and now it\u2019s my turn.\u201d We\u2019re excited to do some solo writing and editing, but we also have dual directing plans.\n\nHow\u2019s that film that\u2019s been in scripting for two years?\n\nIt\u2019s coming along! I\u2019m so proud of it. We\u2019re inches from being able to shoot it this winter.
