Carnet discovered that it was in fact the last remaining 19th-century vespasienne urinal in the city. He decided he needed to save it.\n\n\u201cIt no longer conforms to the comfort standards of today,\u201d he says of the urinal (an understatement). \u201cBut it\u2019s a piece of heritage and it\u2019s in a terrible state in the middle of the boulevard \u2013 it\u2019s not possible to just leave it like that.\u201d\n\nMost of the public's suggestions aren\u2019t bizarre or complicated \u2013 they\u2019re serious. They\u2019re not harebrained Pauline V\u00e9ron\n\nIn January, Carnet submitted a proposal to restore the vespasienne to Paris\u2019s participatory budget scheme, which allows residents to vote on how they want the city to spend \u20ac100m (\u00a389m) \u2013 5% of its capital budget.\n\nThe urinal is \u201cpart of the great Parisian history of public sanitation,\u201d he says, though he admits he\u2019s never used it himself. \u201cThe participatory budget is an opportunity to give it a second youth.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, launched the city\u2019s participatory budget scheme in 2014.

Sadly for him, the vespasienne was not one of the 11 major projects and 183 smaller propositions that earned enough votes to become reality. Instead, Parisians chose projects that ranged from better recycling facilities to upgraded cycling infrastructure to programmes to help women who are experiencing homelessness.\n\nMore than 140,000 people voted in the scheme, the sixth (and possibly last) time residents have been able to choose how the administration of mayor Anne Hidalgo spends a significant portion of its money.\n\nAs usual, while the quixotic propositions tend to garner attention during the voting stage, it is the serious improvements to the city that tend to get funded, such as the \u20ac1.5m plan to upgrade cleaning facilities that won more than 37,000 votes last year, or the decision to send funds to a temporary migrant camp built on the outskirts of the city at the height of refugee arrivals to Europe.\n\nParis\u2019s deputy mayor for local democracy, Pauline V\u00e9ron, says the vast majority of projects \u201caren\u2019t bizarre or complicated \u2013 they\u2019re serious. They can be original, a bit new or innovative, but they\u2019re not harebrained.\u201d\n\nThe scheme was launched when Hidalgo came to power in 2014. At \u20ac45 per inhabitant, V\u00e9ron says Paris runs the largest per capita participatory budget in the world. Overall, more than 1,800 individual city improvements have been realised thanks to the public vote, V\u00e9ron says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Last year\u2019s budget funded upgrades to cleaning facilities in the city.

A plan to bulldoze Sacr\u00e9-Coeur on the basis that it was an insult to the legacy of the 1871 Paris Commune was famously disqualified at this stage in 2017. (The city demurred not because the project would involve the permanent destruction of one of the most famous buildings in the world, but because the church belonged to the Archdiocese of Paris, and was hence outside its jurisdiction.)\n\nThe programme was inspired by the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, which successfully introduced a participatory budget in 1989 to tackle its rampant inequality. It is with the redistributive spirit of Porto Alegre in mind that Paris specifically allocates \u20ac30m of its participatory budget to working-class areas, V\u00e9ron says.\n\nDespite this, the Paris incarnation lacks the radical spirit of the Brazilian scheme, says Gilles Pradeau, who is writing his PhD on participatory budgets at the University of Westminster. He notes that while a large part of the Porto Alegre budget was decided by residents, \u201cwhat is critical in Paris about the making of the city is not done through participatory budgeting\u201d.\n\nStill, the Paris scheme and one launched in Lisbon in 2008 have helped kick off a wave of imitators across Europe \u2013 similar projects are under way in Milan, Glasgow and Madrid. In France, the number of participatory budgets has doubled each year since 2014.\n\nWith city elections set for March next year, it is not certain that Paris\u2019s participatory budget will survive if Hidalgo, who has not yet announced her candidacy but who is widely expected to run, does not win re-election.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Not razed ...

A recent study of participatory budgets across France found that they were becoming increasingly popular across all political parties, with 23% administered by rightwing administrations in 2018.\n\nProtesters damage 'sexist' open-air urinals in Paris Read more\n\nWhatever happens in 2020, V\u00e9ron says the budget will be an important part of Hidalgo\u2019s legacy.\n\nAnd if the legacy of the last vespasienne in Paris still hangs in the balance, public urination did get a boost this year: a \u20ac240,000 proposal to install designer urinals along the Canal Saint Martin will now go ahead, thanks to the votes of more than 2,000 impatient Parisians.\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "Residents of France\u2019s capital can propose ideas for and vote on what 5% of the city\u2019s budget will be spent on every year \u2013 and their suggestions range from the quixotic to the ambitious", "authors": ["Megan Clement"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493da0a511a8ed4d32299b20c6a2f1fa3ddfe02f/0_258_3954_2373/master/3954.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d872cd0de34ef1d28800aaa103861cf9"}
