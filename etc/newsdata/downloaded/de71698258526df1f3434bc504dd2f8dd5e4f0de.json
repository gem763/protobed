But what the study didn\u2019t say is that its lead author has past research ties to the meat and food industry.\n\nThe new report, published this week in the Annals of Internal Medicine, stunned scientists and public health officials because it contradicted long-standing nutrition guidelines about limiting consumption of red and processed meats. The analysis, led by Bradley C. Johnston, an epidemiologist at Dalhousie University in Canada, and more than a dozen researchers concluded that warnings linking meat consumption to heart disease and cancer are not backed by strong scientific evidence.\n\nSeveral prominent nutrition scientists and health organizations criticized the study\u2019s methods and findings. But Johnston and his colleagues defended the work, saying it relied on the highest standards of scientific evidence, and noted that the large team of investigators reported no conflicts of interest and conducted the review without outside funding.\n\nJohnston also indicated on a disclosure form that he did not have any conflicts of interest to report during the past three years. But as recently as December 2016 he was the senior author on a similar study that tried to discredit international health guidelines advising people to eat less sugar. That study, which also appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine, was paid for by the International Life Sciences Institute, or ILSI, an industry trade group largely supported by agribusiness, food and pharmaceutical companies and whose members have included McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cargill, one of the largest beef processors in North America. The industry group, founded by a top Coca-Cola executive four decades ago, has long been accused by the World Health Organization and others of trying to undermine public health recommendations to advance the interests of its corporate members.\n\nIn an interview, Johnston said his past relationship with ILSI had no influence on the current research on meat recommendations. He said he did not report his past relationship with ILSI because the disclosure form asked only about potential conflicts within the past three years. Although the ILSI-funded study publication falls within the three-year window, he said the money from ILSI arrived in 2015, and he was not required to report it for the meat study disclosure.\n\n\u201cThat money was from 2015 so it was outside of the three-year period for disclosing competing interests,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cI have no relationship with them whatsoever.\u201d\n\nCritics of the meat study say that while Johnston may have technically complied with the letter of the disclosure rules, he did not comply with the spirit of financial disclosure.\n\n\u201cJournals require disclosure, and it is always better to disclose fully, if for no other reason than to stay out of trouble when the undisclosed conflicts are exposed,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who studies conflicts of interest in nutrition research. \u201cBehind the scenes, ILSI works diligently on behalf of the food industry; it is a classic front group. Even if ILSI had nothing to do with the meat papers \u2014 and there is no evidence of which I am aware that it did \u2014 the previous paper suggests that Johnston is making a career of tearing down conventional nutrition wisdom.\u201d\n\nNotably, Johnston and colleagues thought it was important to fully disclose their personal eating habits. The meat paper includes an appendix titled \u201cSummary of Panelists\u2019 Potential Conflicts of Interest,\u201d that discloses whether each author eats red or processed meat and how often. Johnston reported no financial conflicts of interest but disclosed that he eats one to two servings of red or processed meat per week.\n\n\u201cWe think that\u2019s a potential bias that is worth disclosing,\u201d Johnston said about the researchers\u2019 personal eating habits.\n\nJohnston\u2019s ties to the 2016 ILSI-funded sugar study show how ILSI has methodically cultivated allies in academia around the world, and how it recruits influential scientists to help shape global nutrition advice and counter what it perceives to be anti-food industry guidelines by health organizations.", "description": "A surprising new study challenged decades of nutrition advice and gave consumers the green light to eat more red and processed meat.
