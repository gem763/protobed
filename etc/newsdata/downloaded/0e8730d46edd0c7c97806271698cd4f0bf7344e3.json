For Britain to ask us to do that, is a very unreasonable request and it won't be the basis of a deal.\"\n\nCoveney said that while Ireland believed Johnson was \"serious\" about finding a revised Brexit deal before the October 31 deadline, \"we need to be honest with people and say we are not close to that deal right now.\"\n\nCoveney: 'Everybody needs a dose of reality here'\n\nBorder Communities Against Brexit Recent reports in the UK have suggested both sides are moving closer to agreeing on an alternative to the backstop.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told Sky News on Thursday \"we can have a deal.\"\n\nRead more: These business owners on the Irish border fear a no-deal Brexit could soon wreck their livelihoods\n\nHowever, Coveney on Friday said \"everybody needs a dose of reality here.\"\n\nHe told the BBC: \"What we [Ireland] are being asked to do by Stephen Barclay [UK Brexit Secretary] and others, is to replace a guarantee on the border that solves it, with a promise that, somehow, we will do our best to try to solve it in the future but we don't know how just yet. That doesn't sound like a good deal to me.\n\n\"What we won't do is pretend we are solving a problem to get past a political obstacle and then have to level with people in a few months time and say actually, the solution doesn't work at all.\"\n\nBrexit talks 'have gone backwards'\n\nGetty Coveney's remarks suggest the UK and EU are nowhere closer to agreeing a new Brexit deal ahead of a United Nations meet-up in New York next week where Brexit is set to be one of the talking points for European leaders in attendance.\n\nJohnson is attending as well as Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.\n\nMultiple Brussels reporters have said EU officials are gloomy about the prospects of a new Brexit deal.\n\nAnalyst Mujtaba Rahman on Thursday tweeted \"things have gone backwards\" whlie The Telegraph's Peter Foster quoted a source who said talks were \"basically back to summer of 2017.\"\n\nOne Brussels source told Business Insider that recent reports in Britain that Johnson was moving closer to reaching a revised deal with the EU were \"total s--- from Westminster sources.\"\n\nNaomi Smith, CEO of pro-EU group Best For Britain, told Business Insider: \"We're not close to a deal because this Prime Minister isn't trying to get one. At this rate, we're heading for a disastrous no-deal Brexit.\n\n\"Given the government's refusal to take the Irish border question seriously, Simon Coveney is right to point out Brexit could see a return to civil unrest. This is deeply worrying for the future of our country, and the Union.\"", "description": "Ireland's deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said there was a \"wide gap\" between Boris Johnson and the EU in Brexit talks.", "authors": ["Adam Payne"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8493c52e22af5d6d0cb3e2-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
