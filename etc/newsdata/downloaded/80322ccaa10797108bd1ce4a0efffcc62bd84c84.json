(BDO.PH) said its third-quarter net profit rose 43% from a year earlier, as revenue increased steadily.\n\nThe Philippines' largest bank by assets said Monday that net profit for the third quarter was 11.96 billion Philippine peso ($233.5 million), up from PHP8.37 billion a year ago. That beat analysts' estimate of PHP9.85 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, net profit rose 49% to PHP32.11 billion, largely driven by the expansion in the bank's recurring core revenue streams, it said. Customer loans rose 6% from a year earlier to PHP2.1 trillion, while total deposits increased 3% to PHP2.4 trillion, the lender said.\n\nBDO said its third-quarter revenue jumped 19% to PHP55.43 billion.\n\nWrite to Kosaku Narioka at kosaku.narioka@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
