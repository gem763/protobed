It took on its current name and current leadership earlier this year when Univision sold the unit to private equity firm Great Hill Partners, who appointed former Forbes.com CEO Jim Spanfeller as its new chief executive.\n\nSince then, the relationship between G/O Media leadership and the editorial staff has been rocky, as you would have learned by reading Deadspin itself, particularly an in-depth story by Wagner in August about how employees were unhappy with \u201ca lack of communication regarding company goals, seeming disregard for promoting diversity within the top ranks of the company, and by repeated and egregious interference with editorial procedures.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, Deadspin\u2019s editor in chief Megan Greenwell resigned, saying that G/O Media\u2019s new editorial director Paul Maidment was directing the staff to stick to sports coverage \u2014 a decision that she argued wasn\u2019t dictated by traffic, since \u201cposts on The Concourse, Deadspin\u2019s vertical dedicated to politics and culture and other topics that are not sports, outperform posts on the main site by slightly more than two to one.\u201d\n\nApparently Maidment repeated that edict in a memo earlier this week, which was leaked to The Daily Beast, and in which he said, \u201cDeadspin will write only about sports and that which is relevant to sports in some way.\u201d\n\nA statement about the resignations at Deadspin. pic.twitter.com/NrUmtHzZbq \u2014 GMG Union (@gmgunion) October 30, 2019\n\nThe Deadspin homepage was subsequently filled with non-sports content, and editor Barry Petchesky tweeted that he had been \u201cfired from Deadspin for not sticking to sports.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Deadspin also posted a story criticizing auto-playing ads on the site, declaring, \u201cWe, the writers, editors, and video producers of Deadspin, are as upset with the current state of our site\u2019s user experience as you are.\u201d The post is no longer live, but the criticism reportedly prompted advertiser Farmers Insurance to pull the campaign.\n\nThis all appears to have prompted a mass exodus from Deadspin today. The Gizmodo Media Group union also issued this statement:\n\nToday, a number of our colleagues at Deadspin resigned from their positions. From the outset, CEO Jim Spanfeller has worked to undermine a successful site by curtailing its most well-read coverage because it makes him personally uncomfortable. This is not what journalism looks like and it is not what editorial independence looks like. \u201cStick to sports\u201d is and always has been a thinly veiled euphemism for \u201cdon\u2019t speak truth to power.\u201d In addition to being bad business, Spanfeller\u2019s actions are morally reprehensible. The GMG Union stands with our current and former Deadspin colleagues and condemns Jim Spanfeller in the strongest possible terms.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to G/O Media for comment and will update if we hear back.", "description": "Writers Laura Wagner, Kelsey McKinney, Tom Ley, Lauren Theisen, Patrick Redford, Albert Burneko and Chris Thompson all tweeted today that they have resigned from Deadspin, the sports-focused site owned by G/O Media.
