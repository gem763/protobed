Officials", "language": "en", "text": "Trump Administration to Deny Visas to Same-Sex Partners of Diplomats, U.N. Officials\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday began denying visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats and United Nations employees, and requiring those already in the United States to get married by the end of the year or leave the country.\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the U.N. portrayed the decision\u2014which foreign diplomats fear will increase hardships for same-sex couples in countries that don\u2019t recognize same-sex marriage\u2014as an effort to bring its international visa practices in line with current U.S. policy. In light of the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, the U.S. extends diplomatic visas only to married spouses of U.S. diplomats.\n\n\u201cSame-sex spouses of U.S. diplomats now enjoy the same rights and benefits as opposite-sex spouses,\u201d the U.S. mission wrote in a July 12 note to U.N.-based delegations. \u201cConsistent with [State] Department policy, partners accompanying members of permanent missions or seeking to join the same must generally be married in order to be eligible\u201d for a diplomatic visa.\n\nBut critics says the new policy will impose undue hardships on foreign couples from countries that criminalize same-sex marriages.\n\nSamantha Power, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, denounced the new policy on Twitter as \u201cneedlessly cruel & bigoted.\u201d\n\n\u201cState Dept. will no longer let same-sex domestic partners of UN employees get visas unless they are married,\u201d she tweeted, noting that \u201conly 12% of UN member states allow same-sex marriage.\u201d\n\nIn July, the U.S. mission sent out diplomatic notes to the United Nations and representatives for foreign diplomatic missions explaining the new policy, which reversed a 2009 decision by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to grant visas to domestic partners of U.S. and foreign diplomats. The contents of the diplomatic note were first reported in August by the Washington Blade. The 2009 policy, however, did not allow a heterosexual domestic partner of a U.S. or foreign diplomat to enter the country on a diplomatic visa.\n\nThe new policy \u2014which enters into force Monday\u2014requires that foreign domestic partners of diplomats and U.N. officials posted in the United States must show the State Department proof of marriage by Dec. 31, or leave the country within 30 days. As of today, domestic partners of diplomats and U.N. officials based abroad will need to show they are married in order to enter the country on a diplomatic visa. The latest policy change, the United States explained in the note, was aimed at ensuring all couples were treated equally.\n\n\u201cThe Department of State will not issue a G-4 visa for same-sex domestic partners,\u201d the U.N. human resources chief explained in a note distributed to staff last month. \u201cAs of 1 October 2018, same-sex domestic partners \u2026 seeking to join newly arrived U.N. officials must provide proof of marriage to eligible for a G-4 visa or to seek a change in such status.\u201d\n\nThere are currently at least 10 U.N. employees in the United States who would need to get married by the New Year to have their partners\u2019 visas extended.\n\nThe new policy poses a number of risks for same-sex partners, according to Alfonso Nam, the president of U.N. Globe, a U.N. LGBTI staff advocacy organization.\n\nSame-sex couples already inside of the United States could go to city hall and get married. But they could potentially be exposed to prosecution if they return to a country that criminalizes homosexuality or same-sex marriages.\n\nThe United States informed foreign governments that they would allow \u201climited exceptions\u201d to its new policy in cases involving diplomats from countries where same-sex marriage is illegal. But that government would have to provide documentation proving that same-sex marriage was illegal and commit to accepting same-sex partners of U.S. diplomats.\n\nYet that exception was not offered to U.N. officials.\n\n\u201cWith this change, the State Department is enforcing parity in the way they recognize opposite-sex partnerships and same-sex partnerships,\u201d U.N. Globe said in a statement. \u201cIt is an unfortunate change in rules, since same-sex couples, unlike opposite-sex couples, have limited choices when it comes to marriage.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "", "authors": ["Colum Lynch", "Sally Hayden", "Stephen M.
