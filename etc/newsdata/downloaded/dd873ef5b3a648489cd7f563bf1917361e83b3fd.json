This is the weight of grief.\n\nIn late August, we celebrated my father-in-law\u2019s birthday. Life was as \u201cnormal\u201d as could be, outside of typical stressors. We spent a lovely afternoon at a popular local restaurant. While my two young kids made small messes at the table, we discussed future vacation plans. We talked sports and shared sips from our brewery flights. It was so nice that I paused to ask for a family photo, which my father-in-law was happy to capture. With the sun shining down upon us, things felt right.\n\nExactly one week later, we received one of those early morning phone calls you never hope to get. A family member calling well outside a usual time.\n\nHe was gone. Just like that.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the exact cause, but we are thankful to know he didn\u2019t suffer. My husband and I were speechless and devastated.\n\nRelated:\u200b What I Learned About the 'Right Way' to Grieve Since My Dad's Death\n\nFamiliar feelings began to surface. Around the same time eight years prior, my husband served as my rock as we faced the loss of my dad. He died by suicide two months after our wedding. This was a transformative moment for me as I reluctantly learned the impact of traumatic loss. I know the road that follows \u2013 it\u2019s a heavy and complicated grief journey one continues to navigate long after the memorials subside.\n\nMy father-in-law had become like a dad to me. He gave me life advice, helped us with home repairs and reminded us to test the smoke detector. His faith inspired my healing.\n\nIn America, we\u2019re typically given a handful of days to neatly address a family member\u2019s passing. In that time, we try to gather family, unbox photos and go through the motions of a funeral while deep in shock. Attempting to do this while parenting two children under four is emotionally exhausting.\n\nRelated:\u200b How a Survivors of Suicide Support Group Helped Me After My Brother's Death\n\nIt left a mark.\n\nI took this \u201cgriefie\u201d when the overwhelm of the prior days had reached its peak. I remembered that earlier family photo \u2013 which I\u2019m so fortunate to have and now cherish. I thought about how those innocent and joyful feelings were suddenly so foreign. I had seen my new reflection in the mirror moments before. The sleepless, puffy eyes. The unwashed hair. The plain, pale face. I wanted to show it. The weight of grief is real.\n\nI had never really thought about my appearance while grieving. The day my father-in-law died, I ventured out to pick up a few items for our family at the grocery store. Still un-showered from the early morning chaos, I entered the check-out line in workout attire (my quickest, comfy grab) and a ponytail. The cashier asked for my ID to ring up the case of beer I\u2019d bought for my husband. Innocent enough, the male employee took a look at my license picture then glanced at me and said something to the effect of, \u201cIf I may be so bold, you look really nice with your hair down.\u201d So deep in thought about what we were facing, it struck me. He had no idea why I looked so disheveled. I\u2019m sure it was meant as a compliment, but the idea that I could have been more polished in that moment further prompted me to share.\n\nRelated:\u200b The Gift That Comes From Grief\n\nGrief and loss are hard work. Afforded a few days outside the office to manage, bereaved loved ones are not on vacation or taking it easy. We\u2019re coming back depleted. I recently read that Facebook updated their bereavement policy to 20 days based on Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s loss experience. This feels appropriate to give families time to cope, reflect and plan for a future without their loved one. During heavy grief, it can also be helpful to allow for time to do nothing. The emotional investment can feel exhausting. This is a period to rest and give yourself grace.\n\nThis picture reflects the week of uncertainty and sadness, the unexpected planning and the beginning of a new grief journey. I\u2019m running on fumes. I\u2019ll do my best to conceal the evidence, but it\u2019s still there. And it will be for some time, even if I shy away from talking about it.\n\nWith loss comes the guilt over how long one might take to recover. Do we ever truly? While we might go back to looking like ourselves on the outside, the inside is heavy.\n\nThis is the weight of grief.\n\nFollow this journey on Our Side of Suicide\n\nRead more stories like this on The Mighty:\n\nThe Expectation of Grieving a Suicide Loss\n\nWhy I Really Keep Sharing on Social Media My Grief About My Brother's Death\n\nWhen You Lose That Person", "description": "The writer describes the impact of a traumatic loss of a loved one, and how difficult it can be.
