Tanko\u2019s murder more gruesome was the fact that his assailants not only killed him, they set his body ablaze in his car,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Adekoya also recalled how earlier that same month, Fr. Paul Offu of Enugu Diocese was murdered, and Fr. Clement Ugwu was kidnapped and killed some months before.\n\nDecrying \u201cthe killings of these anointed men of God,\u201d Adekoya said that the government \u201chas lost grip of the security situation in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we hold dear that the protection of lives and property and the welfare of citizens are the greatest responsibility of any government towards its citizens, then our present-day government has fallen far short of the expectation of Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Adekoya is not alone in denouncing the deplorable state of insecurity in the country, especially for Nigeria\u2019s Christians.\n\nThe Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna Archdiocese, Mathew Man\u2019oso Ndagoso, said that the Buhari government must \u201cwake up to its responsibilities\u201d of ensuring adequate security across the country.\n\n\u201cAnybody who cares for this country must be concerned about what is happening today regarding insecurity,\u201d the archbishop said. \u201cWhat is happening in the North East which has crept into the North West, South East and South West is becoming alarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have made this call before and I will still make it that the responsibility of any government either through the ballot or barrels of the gun or through whatever means is to safeguard the life and property of the citizenry,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in August, more than 50 lethal, anti-Christian attacks took place in Nigeria during the first six months of 2019, while in 2018 some 2,400 Christians were killed by Fulani Muslims.\n\nNigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari, who is himself of the Fulani ethnic group, has encouraged a narrative that minimizes the importance of religion in the conflict between Muslims and Christians in central Nigeria.\n\nNonetheless, two local Catholic bishops, as well as other Christian leaders, have insisted that the violence represents a \u201cclear agenda for Islamizing the Nigerian Middle Belt\u201d by using armed Fulani jihadists.\n\nOne of the bishops, Matthew Ishaya Audu of Lafia, said in 2018 that the ongoing attacks are not random or economically motivated, but purposefully target Christians.\n\n\u201cThey want to strike Christians,\u201d Bishop Audu said, \u201cand the government does nothing to stop them, because President Buhari is also of the Fulani ethnic group.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Catholic leaders in Nigeria have decried the reigning state of unrest in the country, urging President Buhari to protect Nigerian citizens.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
