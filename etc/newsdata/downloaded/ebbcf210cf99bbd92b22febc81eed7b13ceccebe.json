The claim consists of four items: Holiday pay - \u00a3159,772 Unpaid salary increase he claims he was entitled to - \u00a322,930 Returning Officer election fees since 2013 - \u00a379,684 Legal fees for defending the criminal case - \u00a341,841 Total cost = \u00a3319,337\n\nCriminal charges were dropped in 2015 and the two other men agreed payouts worth \u00a3300,000 between them.\n\nBut no agreement was made with Mr O'Sullivan and he was put on special leave, continuing to receive his salary.\n\nSpeaking after his sacking, Mr O'Sullivan said: 'What I would say to the people of Caerphilly now is wait until the employment tribunal takes place in public, wait until the full facts emerge in the public domain. Then make a reasoned decision.'\n\nHe added the decision was made 'clearly on political ground' and said the matter 'was far from concluded.'\n\nCaerphilly Council said earlier this month that 'serious allegations of gross misconduct had been proven' and that 'the right decision has been made.'\n\nCommenting on Mr O'Sullivan's demand for more than \u00a3300,000, a council insider said: 'The people of Caerphilly county will be absolutely staggered at the cheek of these claims when Anthony O'Sullivan has already received more than \u00a31m in pay and pension payments while sitting at home for the past six years.\n\n'Claiming \u00a3159,000 in lieu of leave beggars belief - he's effectively been on holiday for the past six years. Anthony O'Sullivan has no shame and he's clearly determined to take council taxpayers to the cleaners.'\n\nA councillor who did not wish to be identified said: 'I have never heard anything like this in my life. The council is already a laughing stock after paying him not to work for so long.\n\n'This absolutely takes the biscuit.'", "description": "Anthony O'Sullivan, who pocketed his annual \u00a3137,000 salary over six years despite being suspended has now demanded another \u00a3300,000 from Caerphilly Council.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/17/20141836-0-image-a-7_1571933183957.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
