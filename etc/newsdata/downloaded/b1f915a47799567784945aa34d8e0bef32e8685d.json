Where the hell is he?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter?\u201d\n\n\u201cHey fellas, I have an idea for a new T-shirt,\u201d the president then quipped. \u201cLet\u2019s do another T-shirt: \u2018Where\u2019s Hunter?'\u201d\n\nAt another point in the rally, President Trump turned his attention to the 76-year-old Biden, who he said was only a good vice president because he understood how to \u201ckiss\u201d former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cass.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo months after President Obama put Joe in charge of Ukraine policy\u2026 and the press will not write it. They say, \u2018In totally unsubstantiated charges,\u2019 every time they talk about him, \u2018President Trump has said that his son walked away with a fortune, now you know that\u2019s a totally unsubstantiated charge.\u2019 Really? It\u2019s not unsubstantiated, it\u2019s a fact,\u201d he added.\n\nAs Breitbart News extensively reported, Hunter\u2019s investment company scored a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013. Further, then-vice president Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating the gas giant Burisma Holdings, which was paying Hunter Biden $83,000 per month as a member of its board, despite having no expertise in the energy sector. Biden later boasted before the Council of Foreign Relations that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was removed from his post.", "description": "Former Vice President and 2020 candidate Joe Biden lashed out at President Donald Trump's remarks during his Thursday evening re-election rally, stating \"America is so much stronger than your weakness.\"", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175240587-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
