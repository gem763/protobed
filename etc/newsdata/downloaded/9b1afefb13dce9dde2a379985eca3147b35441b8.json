Sorry to everyone who I let down. \u2014 Ben Askren (@Benaskren) October 26, 2019\n\nPeople mock Ronda Rousey but she was a pioneer & champion. Askren for me is the most overrated fighter the UFC has ever signed. Just goes to show the difference in levels between Asia eg One Championship & the @ufc. No comparison. Even the Lawler win is debatable. #UFCsingapore \u2014 Tam Khan (@Tam_Khan) October 26, 2019\n\nBen Askren is without a shadow of a doubt the most overrated MMA fighter of all time. \u2014 Se\u00e1n Sheehan (@SeanSheehanBA) October 26, 2019\n\nBen Askren: I\u2019ll beat anybody in the ufc\n\n\n\nAnybody in the ufc: #ufcsingaporepic.twitter.com/qst2snEb4V \u2014 Seth (@SethShaffer) October 26, 2019\n\n'Funky' Askren himself fronted up afterwards, saying he had got \"overconfident\" against one of MMA's greatest grapplers.\n\nHe's not one to shy away in defeat!@BenAskren spoke backstage after #UFCSingapore... pic.twitter.com/M2YggcxgSc \u2014 UFC Europe (@UFCEurope) October 26, 2019\n\nAskren said he would have to \"go home, sit down and think about\" where he goes from here, but there will be big questions over the fighting future of a man once surrounded by so much hype.", "description": "UFC welterweight Ben Askren\u2019s fighting future appears in the balance after the cocksure American suffered a demoralizing defeat to Brazilian veteran Demian Maia at UFC Singapore.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db4761820302752e854209e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
