REUTERS/Louis Nastro - TM3EB4M1B1L01\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Friday, the U.S. military said, a move likely to anger Beijing.\n\nThe busy waterway is one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-Chinese relationship, which include an escalating trade war, American sanctions on China\u2019s military and U.S. relations with Taiwan.\n\nCommander Reann Mommsen, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy\u2019s Seventh Fleet, told Reuters that the destroyer Wayne E. Meyer challenged territorial claims in the operation, including what she described as excessive Chinese claims around the Paracel Islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\n\u201c...China has attempted to claim more internal waters, territorial sea, exclusive economic zone, and continental shelf than it is entitled under international law,\u201d Mommsen said.\n\nChina\u2019s defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe United States on Thursday welcomed China\u2019s renewed purchases of U.S. farm goods while maintaining the threat of U.S. tariff hikes as the world\u2019s two largest economies prepared the ground for talks aimed at breaking the logjam in their trade war.\n\nChina and the United States have traded barbs in the past over what Washington has said is Beijing\u2019s militarisation of the South China Sea by building military installations on artificial islands and reefs in disputed waters.\n\nChina\u2019s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.\n\nBeijing says its construction is necessary for self-defense and that the United States is responsible for increasing tensions by sending warships and military planes close to islands that Beijing claims.", "description": "A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Friday, the U.S. military said, a move likely to anger Beijing.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429476855&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1M4-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
