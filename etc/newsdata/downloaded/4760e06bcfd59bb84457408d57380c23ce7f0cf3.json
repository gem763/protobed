John Bel Edwards is fending off charges he created the chaos with raw political retribution.\n\nMr. Edwards, who is seeking reelection this year, has touted his expansion of Medicaid through Obamacare as one of his signature accomplishments, with his campaign advertising featuring random Louisianians saying they wouldn\u2019t have coverage otherwise.\n\nBut that expansion has been dogged by controversy and costs, and now Republican Rep. Ralph Abraham, who is challenging Mr. Edwards, has bluntly accused the governor of jeopardizing health care coverage as political payback.\n\nStanding on the steps of Louisiana\u2019s Department of Health in Baton Rouge last week, Mr. Abraham delivered a scathing indictment of Mr. Edwards\u2019 stewardship of the department.\n\nThe LDH \u201cis one of the most ineffective and poorly run government agencies in Louisiana \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something,\u201d Mr. Abraham said.\n\nAt issue is approximately $8 billion in contracts along with roughly half of the Louisiana budget.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s Medicaid expansion involves multiple contracts with managed care organizations (MCOs), the biggest of which is with Louisiana Healthcare Connections (LHCC) that covers roughly 30% of enrollees, or more than 450,000 individuals.\n\nLHCC\u2019s parent company, Centene Management, has emerged as the third largest contributor to the Republican Governors Association, giving it $1 million to date, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nLess than two days after The Advocate reported that contribution, the Edwards administration rejected LHCC\u2019s latest bid, a rejection that is now tied up with formal protests and potential lawsuits and has forced Louisiana to patch up coverage in some cases through emergency contracts.\n\nMr. Abraham says it is easy to connect the dots, but the notion Mr. Edwards cut out LHCC as \u201cpolitical retribution,\u201d because of Centene\u2019s donations is completely false, his campaign said.\n\n\u201cPutting aside all the other reasons it\u2019s a dumb accusation, it doesn\u2019t even hold up under the Abraham\u2019s folks\u2019 own flawed logic,\u201d said Eric Holl, a campaign spokesman. \u201cCentene has given more than $2 million to the [Democratic Governors\u2019 Association] since Gov. Edwards took office.\u201d\n\nYet complaints about the process have not been confined to Republicans and losing bidders.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Cedric Richmond of New Orleans, and former New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, who now heads the National Urban League, have also written Mr. Edwards questioning his decisions.\n\nNot only is the current situation frightening tens of thousands of constituents, but the new contract could result in the loss of more than 700 jobs in Louisiana, Mr. Richmond and Mr. Morial noted.\n\nEven before the latest blooming scandal, Louisiana\u2019s Medicaid expansion has been bedeviled by controversy.\n\nFirst, it emerged that hundreds of people with six-figure incomes and thousands of people overall who should have never been eligible for the subsidies were enrolled. Then, in the course of sorting out those individuals, some who were entitled to Medicaid found themselves temporarily cut off.\n\nIn addition, the administration has acknowledged it underestimated the cost to Louisiana of the expansion by roughly $400 million.\n\nNow, the situation is completely opaque, with both LHCC and Aetna, another losing bidder, lodging formal complaints with the State Office of Procurement.\n\nLHCC contends it is inexplicable that its participation would be terminated at the end of the year because it has amassed an exemplary record with Louisiana since first winning a contract under the administration of Gov. Bobby Jindal in 2012.\n\n\u201cYou wonder, what\u2019s the reason? Where is this coming from?\u201d said Randal Johnson, a strategic consultant working with LHCC. \u201cIt has to be something untoward.\u201d\n\nIt was in fact in order to trim costs and improve care that the Edwards administration announced it would seek new bidding on the contracts this year with the new situation to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nAfter some delays, the administration announced last month that it would contracts with four NCOs instead of five, LHCC being the one cut out.\n\nMr. Abraham contends it is also telling that, in response to public records requests filed for documents related to the new bidding and decisions, Mr. Edwards\u2019 staff said they would likely not be available until Oct. 14 \u2014 two days after Louisiana voters go to the polls in the jungle primary round of the governor\u2019s race.\n\nThat date has now been extended even further, to Oct. 17, Mr. Johnson said Monday.\n\nLHCC lodged its formal complaint Aug. 19.\n\n\u201cThis process was never fair,\u201d its attorneys wrote. \u201cRather, it was tainted with conflicts of interest and bias from the start.\u201d\n\nIn the complaint, LHCC highlights internal communications between Department of Health staffers that is says reflects animus toward LHCC. For example, following a regulatory ruling against it LHCC contends cost it $10 million, last year the state ruled against the company in a ruling it said cost it $10 million, some state staffers rejoiced.\n\nAfter communicating that decision, a state worker emailed one of LHCC\u2019s competitors, \u201cI thought I heard an explosion!!:)\u201d and a smiley emoji.\n\nSimilarly, when LHCC\u2019s appeal on that ruling was rejected, the LDH executive who made the decision emailed colleagues a drawing of a woman dropping a microphone to which one responded, \u201cLOL.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe expression of glee on having imposed a harsh decision on LHCC reflects a striking level of animosity and hostility toward LHCC: one wonders what emotion she might have expressed after LHCC\u2019s bid was denied here,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nFor now, all sides are awaiting a ruling later this month from the state\u2019s procurement office. In the meantime, Mr. Abraham said the Edwards\u2019 administrations decisions and delays fail to pass the smell test.\n\nWith the federal portion of Medicaid payments under Obamacare expansion falling next year, Louisiana\u2019s situation will only grow more dire, he said.\n\n\u201cThe dishonesty and lack of transparency from the governor\u2026is appalling and unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Abraham said. \u201cFinally, what might be the worst of all, is the political retribution of this administration.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
