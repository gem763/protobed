Boris Johnson faces big votes Tuesday.", "language": "en", "text": "Johnson warned lawmakers that if they vote down his three-day timetable, he will pull the bill and push for general election. Such a move would likely put Brexit on hold and could throw the divisive issue once more before the public.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson said Parliament was \u201ccaught in a deadlock of its own making.\u201d The prime minister vowed he\u2019d \u201cin no way allow months more of this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked about the government\u2019s refusal to publish an economic assessment of the deal, Johnson said the agreement would be a \u201cpowerful positive shot in the arm for the U.K. economy.\u201d\n\nJohnson already had to eat a thick slice of humble pie when, on Saturday, he was forced to ask the E.U. for a Brexit delay until the end of January.\n\nThen House of Commons Speaker John Bercow denied him a quickie up-or-down vote on his deal on Monday.\n\nNow Johnson is back at it.\n\nThe first vote on Tuesday is important, but symbolic. It will ask legislators whether they want to move forward with the Withdrawal Agreement Bill that the government has introduced. This is the legislation needed to enact the Brexit deal that Johnson successfully negotiated with the E.U. last week.\n\nAD\n\nIf he wins approval on the first vote, then there will be a second, more crucial ballot, on whether to follow Johnson\u2019s call for a fast, three-day debate on the legislation.\n\nAD\n\nThis might prove to be a hard sell \u2014 as lawmakers complain they are being asked to approve legislation they have not even begun to scrutinize, nor in many cases, even read.\n\nThe government published its 110-page bill on Monday evening \u2014 the first chance anyone had a chance to lay eyes on it.\n\nJohnson wants it sorted in 72 hours.\n\nJohnson\u2019s government has withheld an economic analysis of his Brexit deal \u2014 which seeks to leave the E.U. single market, diverge from E.U. customs regimes and tariff schedules and allow Britain to make its own independent trade deals around the world. The Johnson exit is a harder Brexit than that envisioned by his predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal also differs most markedly from May\u2019s over the vexing issue of Northern Ireland. His deal leaves the province much more closely aligned to the E.U. by effectively putting a border down the Irish Sea.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absurdly constrained timetable,\u201d said Jon Tonge, professor of politics at the University of Liverpool. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a single economic assessment done yet, and the deal is significantly different from May\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSome lawmakers pointed out the Parliament spent months debating a bill on how circus animals are treated. Other commentators compared passing Johnson\u2019s Brexit in three days to reading Tolstoy\u2019s phone-book-thick \u201cWar and Peace\u201d on the bus ride home.\n\nAD\n\nThe opposition Labour Party\u2019s Emily Thornberry told the BBC, \u201cThe idea that we are going to be bounced as a country out of the European Union in a period of a few days without politicians being given a chance to look carefully at the basis on which we are making this decision is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an artificial timetable of the 31st of October and we don\u2019t see why we should play Boris Johnson\u2019s game,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nHannah White, deputy director of the Institute for Government, an independent think tank, wrote in a post that the timetable proposed was \u201cdeeply inadequate.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a constitutional bill which makes probably the most significant changes to the U.K.\u2019s position in the world that the Commons has been asked to consider for decades, it is extraordinary,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe government must know this, but it is asking MPs to agree the timetable or be seen to be thwarting Brexit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnyone who claims meaningful legislative scrutiny is possible on this timetable is \u2014 at best \u2014 misguided,\u201d she added.\n\nParliamentarians aren\u2019t known for approving legislation at the click of a finger.\n\nEuropean leaders are taking a wait-and-see approach, but they have signaled that they would likely grant an extension beyond the end of the month.\n\nAD", "description": "The bill is 110 pages.
