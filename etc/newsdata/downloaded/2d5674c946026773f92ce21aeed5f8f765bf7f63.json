(Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe most dangerous of wealthy nations for a child to be born into.\u201d That\u2019s how global health researchers characterized the United States in a January 2018 report published in Health Affairs that sounded alarm bells about the country\u2019s high infant mortality rate. U.S. babies, they found, were three times as likely to die of premature birth and 2.3 times as likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome than infants in comparably rich countries.\n\nAnne Driscoll, a demographer and statistician at the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, has been analyzing possible causes for years and has previously looked at maternal age, the rural-urban divide and other factors. Driscoll and her colleague Danielle Ely teamed up in a report released Wednesday to delve into infant mortality in two of the country\u2019s most impoverished regions: Appalachia and the Mississippi River Delta region. The former includes 26 million people in 420 counties stretching from New York to Georgia, and the latter includes 9.8 million people in 252 counties in eight states in the south. Both have been hit hard by the epidemic of people addicted to opioid painkillers.\n\nDriscoll and Ely chose these areas because they are clearly defined (they are part of federal-state partnerships that encourage business development, infrastructure upgrades and otherwise try to jump-start the areas\u2019 economies), and because they suspected, based on other studies about health outcomes there, that the regions might disproportionately suffer from infant mortality.\n\nThey were right.\n\n[Opioid Files: A Washington Post investigation]\n\n\n\nItems are displayed for sale in a Kentucky yard in 2017.

Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the study published Wednesday, they looked at the characteristics of mothers of the nearly 400,000 babies born in 2017 in the Delta and Appalachia regions and how their children fared. They found that women in the Delta were most likely to be teenagers, unmarried and not have a college degree \u2014 characteristics associated with poor infant outcomes. The infants born in the Delta were most likely to be born preterm, have a low birth weight, and die within the first 12 months. The infant mortality rate in the Delta was 8.17 deaths per 1,000 births, with a rate of 6.82 in Appalachia and 5.67 in the rest of the United States.\n\nDriscoll said in an interview that if these regions were excluded from an analysis of the United States, you would see an overall lowering of the U.S. infant mortality rate \u2014 but only \u201ca little lower, not massively lower.\u201d Some of their previous work, for instance, has shown that maternal age is also a big factor with babies of older women as well as younger women having worse outcomes.\n\nDriscoll said that the analysis is just \u201cstep one\u201d of their work in trying to figure out what is leading to the country\u2019s high infant mortality rates and that many findings raise more questions than answers. For example, they found that there wasn\u2019t a big difference between white women in the Delta and white women in Appalachia. The same goes for black women in the Delta and in Appalachia. But when they looked at Hispanic women who gave birth in the Delta area, the outcomes were significantly better than those in Appalachia. In fact, they were more similar to that of the rest of the United States. She said that needs further investigation. It could have to do with age, better health characteristics, education or something else entirely.\n\n\u201cThis is something we want to explore more,\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a protective effect or something different going on? We don\u2019t know yet, but we think it\u2019s very important to find out.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nPatients face higher fees and longer waits after Planned Parenthood quits federal program\n\n\u2018A dangerous drug\u2019: Surgeon general warns against marijuana use by pregnant women, youths\n\nFact Checker: The surprisingly true comparison between infant mortality in Ohio and Iran", "description": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers highlight striking inequality in a new report on the Mississippi River Delta and Appalachia.", "authors": ["Ariana Eunjung Cha", "National Reporter", "September At Am", "Ariana Eunjung Cha Is A National Reporter.
