Don't Miss Out On First Busey Corporation (NASDAQ:BUSE)", "language": "en", "text": "Could First Busey Corporation (NASDAQ:BUSE) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul? Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nWith First Busey yielding 3.4% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 0.7% of the company's market capitalisation at the time. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding First Busey for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on First Busey!\n\nNasdaqGS:BUSE Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 42% of First Busey's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. One of the risks is that management reinvests the retained capital poorly instead of paying a higher dividend.\n\nWe update our data on First Busey every 24 hours, so you can always get our latest analysis of its financial health, here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nFrom the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. First Busey has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have fallen by 20% or more on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$2.40 in 2009, compared to US$0.84 last year. This works out to be a decline of approximately 10.0% per year over that time. First Busey's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 10.0% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.\n\nWe struggle to make a case for buying First Busey for its dividend, given that payments have shrunk over the past ten years.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nWith a relatively unstable dividend, and a poor history of shrinking dividends, it's even more important to see if EPS are growing. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see First Busey has grown its earnings per share at 18% per annum over the past five years. A company paying out less than a quarter of its earnings as dividends, and growing earnings at more than 10% per annum, looks to be right in the cusp of its growth phase. At the right price, we might be interested.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. Firstly, we like that First Busey has a low and conservative payout ratio. Next, earnings growth has been good, but unfortunately the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. First Busey has a credible record on several fronts, but falls slightly short of our standards for a dividend stock.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could First Busey Corporation (NASDAQ:BUSE) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
