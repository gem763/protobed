She got friendly with Pete after we split,\" Katie stated coolly, referring to original Sugababe Keisha Buchanan.\n\n\"Let's leave that there,\" said Rick hurriedly, as Katie made a retching noise on air.\n\nPete and Keisha were first linked in December 2010 when they were pictured together at various events - and she even turned up to his O2 gig with throat sweets in case he had trouble with his vocals.\n\nBut Pete denied there was any romance there, insisting at the time: \"In truth, we're just good friends.\n\n\"We've got a lot in common in terms of our careers and she's given me such brilliant advice.\n\n\"She's great and I really like her but there's no romance,\" he added.\n\n(Image: Phil Loftus/Capital Pictures)\n\nMirror Online has contacted Peter and Keisha's reps for comment.\n\nDuring her radio appearance, Katie also slated her good friend Kerry Katona's voice, claiming she tells her all the time that she can't sing.\n\n\"I always take the mick out of Kerry and say, 'Kerry you can't even sing'. [Her daughter] has an amazing voice, her and Princess together,\" she said.\n\nKatie then came up with the idea of teaming up with Kerry and Michelle Heaton and calling themselves Girls On Top.\n\n\"Why not me and Michelle, Kerry, you can go in the background,\" she laughed.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"We can go on tour, yeah baby! We could be called Implants. Don't you think that would be fun?\"\n\nShe went on: \"I could be in front, cos I've got more front than them. Kerry, Michelle, if you're listening, why don't we form a band?\"\n\nKatie then turned her attention to Stormzy, saying he should pay a visit to her mucky mansion.\n\n\"I'm amazing in the kitchen. Stormzy can always come and cook for me and my mates. Come and bring a storm to my life, Stormzy,\" she purred on air.\n\nDespite insisting she would no longer be giving away information about her private life for free, Katie couldn't resist dropping a nugget into the conversation as the radio show wrapped.\n\n\"Next year maybe a baby and a wedding,\" she laughed. \"See ya!\"", "description": "A decade after their divorce, Katie Price hinted her ex-husband Peter Andre got cosy with the singer", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Phil Loftus Capital Pictures", "Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20085616.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_British-Soap-Awards-Press-Room.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
