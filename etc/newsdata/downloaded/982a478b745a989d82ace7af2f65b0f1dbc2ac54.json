Mnuchin said Mr. Trump is signing orders that authorize sanctions against any portion of the Turkish government or person tied to the government.\n\n\u201cThe president is concerned about the ongoing military offensive and potential targeting of civilians, civilian infrastructure, ethnic or religious minorities \u2014 and also, the president wants to make very clear, it is imperative that Turkey not allow even a single ISIS fighter to escape,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we are not activating the sanctions,\u201d he added.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what threshold Mr. Trump has in mind for triggering economic punishment, or why he is making this threat only after he announced that about 50 American special forces would exit a key buffer zone along the Turkey-Syria border. Days later, Turkey launched a military assault against U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.\n\nMr. Trump insists he did not greenlight the attack in his phone call last weekend with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he thinks his actions are what led to this. It is a complicated situation,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nMr. Trump has said he is watching developments closely and will \u201cruin\u201d the Turkish economy if their military goes too far.\n\nMr. Trump says he is trying to bring U.S. troops home from never-ending wars.\n\nHe wants countries in Syria\u2019s \u201cneighborhood\u201d to settle their long-running disputes and secure the area. He also wants European nations to take back Islamic State fighters who left to join the now-destroyed caliphate in Syria and Iraq.\n\n\u2022 Ben Wolfgang contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
