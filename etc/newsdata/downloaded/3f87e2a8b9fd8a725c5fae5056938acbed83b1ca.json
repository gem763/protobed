(Pictured: Antarctica)\n\n'So, after 27 hours of continuous work overnight, we got #SROCC approved by Governments! Elation, relief, exhaustion, emotion. Hard to describe. I just hope this bloody thing does some good for the world,' tweeted Michael Meredith, one of the report's authors.\n\nOfficials from 195 countries had to sift through and approve every line of a 30-page executive summary of the report, which is set to be published tomorrow.\n\nThe study will warn that climate change is going to trigger huge increases in flooding damage, melting ice caps and glaciers, and coral-killing ocean heatwaves.\n\nA leaked early draft of the report suggested that, if global temperatures rise by an average of 2\u00b0C (35.6\u00b0F), 280million people could be displaced by rising sea levels.\n\nAnd melting permafrost \u2013 permanently frozen earth \u2013 will release huge amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, creating a cycle of warming.\n\nOne of the scientists who wrote the report, Michael Meredith, said: 'I hope this bloody thing does some good for the world'\n\nSaudi Arabian officials had refused to give their approval for part of the report because it included part of another study they didn't agree with.\n\nThis one suggested a rise of even 1.5\u00b0C would be catastrophic for the Earth and said drastic cuts were needed to the use of fossil fuels.\n\nThe country, which is the world's largest exporter of oil, has raised similar objections to IPCC reports in the past.\n\nOne unnamed member of the UN meeting in Monaco told AFP: 'It really seems like Saudi Arabia only came to this meeting to block any language on 1.5C.'\n\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by 196 nations, called on countries to try and prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2\u00b0C, or 1.5\u00b0C if possible.\n\nAFP reported that the sentence to which the Saudis objected \u2013 'This assessment reinforces findings in IPCC Special Report on 1.5 C' \u2013 was removed from the final draft.\n\nJean-Pierre Gattuso, a French scientist involved in writing the report, tweeted: 'Gaveled! The Special Report on the #Ocean and #Cryosphere #SROCC is approved! A delightful moment at this early morning hour, after 2 years of work and a session of more than 27 h.'\n\nJean-Pierre Gattuso, one of the scientists who contributed to the report, said it was a 'delightful moment' when all the countries finally agreed on the summary's wording", "description": "Officials from Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest exporter of oil, had taken issue with one of the reports referenced in the study which will reveal the extent of devastation to the world's oceans.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/24/13/18868972-0-image-a-21_1569329185397.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
