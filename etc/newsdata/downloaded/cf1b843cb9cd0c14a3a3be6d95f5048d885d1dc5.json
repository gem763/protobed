All talk, no action, and a bunch of sellouts.\u201d\n\nHill, whose district covers Los Angeles County, announced her resignation on Sunday amid an ethics probe into allegations she had an inappropriate relationship with a staff member.\n\nShe\u2019s admitted to a consensual relationship with a campaign staff member, but denied one with a congressional staff member, which would violate U.S. House rules. She\u2019s called herself the victim of revenge porn by an abusive husband she is divorcing.\n\nPapadopoulos, meanwhile, was a key figure in the FBI\u2019s Russia probe into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. That investigation began after revelations that Papadopoulos had learned in 2016 from a Maltese professor that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of emails. He then used that connection to try to set up a meeting between President Donald Trump, then a candidate, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPapadopoulos eventually pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and cooperated in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. He was sentenced in fall 2018 to 14 days in prison.\n\nHe enters a field of at least three other Republicans and one Democrat. The other Republicans are Navy veteran Mike Garcia, bank executive Angela Jacobs Underwood and Mark Cripe, who works for the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. Former Republican Rep. Steve Knight, who lost the seat to Hill in 2018, is also considering running.\n\nThe seat was the last Los Angeles County seat to be held by Republicans before Hill\u2019s victory and was one of seven Democrats flipped last year.\n\nState Assemblywoman Christy Smith is the only Democrat in the race so far. She quickly criticized Papadopoulos on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf he pled guilty to lying to the FBI - how do we know he\u2019ll tell us the truth?\u201d Smith tweeted. \u201cWe deserve someone from our community serving as our voice - not (Trump\u2019s) wannabe political hack!\u201d", "description": "George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who was a key figure in the FBI\u2019s Russia probe, filed paperwork Tuesday to run for the U.S. House seat...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU273_Papado_ZG_20191029194010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
