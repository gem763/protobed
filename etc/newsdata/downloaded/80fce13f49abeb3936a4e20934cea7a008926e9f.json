Over the past 12 years, he's held similar roles at HSBC Bank Canada and IBM Canada.\n\nWhile he acknowledged that some groups have traditionally been excluded from company boards and executive roles, he warned against cutting anyone out of the diversity conversations.\n\nOUT IN THE OPEN: Turning autism into an advantage at work\n\nHazra recalled a recent panel discussion on workplace diversity that he was asked to moderate. Upon arriving, he discovered that the panel included no white males.\n\n\"My feedback to the leader of that particular function was, I think it's great to have the conversation,\" he said. But why not build a panel that properly represents the makeup of the organization?\n\n\"Let everybody talk about this. This isn't a conversation just for the minorities or the underrepresented.\"\n\nRahul Bhardwaj, CEO of the Institute of Corporate Directors, on the push for more diversity on corporate boards 4:32\n\nDiversity as 'human difference'\n\nBut can someone who hasn't experienced discrimination first-hand effectively lead conversations on inclusion?\n\nLast fall, Catalyst Canada, an organization that promotes the advancement of women in corporate leadership, appointed CIBC CEO Victor Dodig as chair of its advisory board.\n\nSome female executives pointed out the irony of selecting a man to advocate for women in the workplace, arguing that the move was a missed opportunity.\n\nHazra acknowledged that his own lived experience inspires his work. As a member of a visible minority who wears his Sikh faith openly, he's experienced discrimination. He also worries about the future employment prospects of his deaf son.\n\nBut diversity shouldn't be framed only in terms of ethnicity, gender, ability or sexual orientation, he said. Speaking of it simply in terms of \"human difference\" allows all kinds of people to relate.\n\nBesides, he said, inequality won't be addressed without first recognizing existing structures.\n\n\"You cannot do it without those who are the brokers of power at the table.\"\n\nThis story appears in the Out in the Open episode \"Allies\".", "description": "Corporate inclusion manager Tej Singh Hazra says addressing inequality \u2018means having everybody at the table\u2019", "authors": ["Out In The Open"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4850207.1540318324!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tej-singh-hazra.jpeg"}
