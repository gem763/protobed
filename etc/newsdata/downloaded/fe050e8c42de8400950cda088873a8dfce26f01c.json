She was entitled to feel safe.\n\n\u2018It was clearly a wholly motiveless attack. It was a ferocious attack. She thought she would die. That\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\n\u2018It was an attack on a very vulnerable woman asleep in her own home. The injuries are truly awful.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetective Sergeant Mark Hanson from Hartlepool CID added: \u2018This sentence reflects the fact that the victim was subject to a sustained and violent attack, disturbingly begun when she was sleeping.\n\n\u2018Clearly this will have a lasting impact on her life.
