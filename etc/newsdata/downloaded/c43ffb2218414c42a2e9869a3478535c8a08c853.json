(Image: Sony/Marvel)\n\nSony\u2019s upcoming Venom sequel seems to be following in the first film\u2019s footsteps and giving its titular monstrous antihero multiple villains to deal with. But this time around, Eddie Brock might be fighting more than just another symbiote and multiple hapless cops.\n\nDeadline reports that Sony plans to work the canonically mutant villain Shriek into Venom 2's plot, suggesting that the movie will borrow heavily from the \u201cMaximum Carnage\u201d event that followed Cletus Cassidy as he teamed up with a number of villains before going on a murder spree in New York City. Powerful as Carnage is, Shriek and the other villains quickly come to loathe the sociopath even though they all ultimately want to cause the same kind of chaos that puts them on Venom\u2019s radar.\n\nShriek and Carnage meeting for the first time.
