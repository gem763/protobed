The new \u201cemergency\u201d order was announced by Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam at a press conference Friday.\n\nThe new law bans \u201cany facial covering that is likely to prevent identification,\u201d during public demonstrations. Anyone arrested under the new rule will face up to a year in prison and a fine of roughly $5,000.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the new law will create a new deterrence effect against masked violent protesters and rioters,\u201d Lam said at a press conference that was carried live online. \u201cHong Kong is not in a state of emergency,\u201d Lam assured citizens. \u201cBut we are indeed in a location of serious danger.\u201d\n\nHong Kong protesters, upset about Beijing\u2019s political incursion into the region, wear masks primarily for three reasons. First, protesters want to keep from being identified by cameras around the city that use facial recognition software. Second, the protesters don\u2019t want to be identified by police forces on the ground, allowing authorities to target them later when they arrive home. And third, the masks can shield protesters from teargas, which has become a common weapon deployed by police.\n\nRumours were swirling this week about the anti-mask rule, dubbed the \u201cprohibition on face covering regulation,\u201d leading to even more protests on the streets as people shouted slogans and sang the region\u2019s new protest anthem, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong.\u201d Protests have gotten even more heated in recent days following an incident on October 1 where a Hong Kong police officer shot a teen protester in the chest.\n\nProtesters regularly destroy security cameras in an effort to stop Chinese authorities from recognising them, but in a world awash with cameras everywhere, the only way to truly be safe is by using masks. Lam said at today\u2019s press conference that bans on face coverings were \u201csomething which has already been introduced in a number of jurisdictions around the world\u201d and defended the move as something that could help to restore peace and order in the region.\n\nHong Kong has had relative autonomy from China\u2019s central government since it was handed over by the British in 1997 and operates under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d rule. The new law was passed by members of Hong Kong\u2019s Executive Council, some of whom are accused of being too closely aligned with the Chinese government in Beijing. Lam herself is often denounced as a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Beijing, who has reportedly wanted to quit her job, but isn\u2019t allowed to by her overseers in China.\n\nLam pointed out that the new law includes exemptions for some people who need to cover their faces for their jobs. And while that might sound great, it would presumably mean that police are allowed to wear masks, while the average person would not.\n\nSome protesters in Hong Kong have asked for the U.S. government to intervene in the region, but that seems highly unlikely. News broke late last night that Trump assured Chinese leader Xi Jinping that he wouldn\u2019t even speak out in support of the protesters if he gave the U.S. concessions in a trade deal. That call took place on June 18, according to CNN, and Trump reportedly asked for dirt on his political opponents, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, something that is illegal under U.S. law.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images Classmates of a student protester shot by police on October 1, 2019, take part in a solidarity rally outside the Tsuen Wan Public Ho Chuen Yiu Memorial College Photo: AP Residents of Tsuen Wan gather at an open air stadium to protest a teenage demonstrator shot at close range in the chest by a police officer in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019.

Most recently, one reporter from the media outlet Suara Hong Kong News, Veby Mega Indah, permanently lost sight in her right eye after police shot her in the face with a rubber bullet on September 30.\n\nThe South China Morning Post, Hong Kong\u2019s largest English-language newspaper, spoke with experts who believe there are plenty of loopholes in the new anti-mask law, though it\u2019s way too early to say whether they\u2019ll be successfully exploited.\n\n\u201cWhat if the guy says he wears a mask because has a cold and shows us a doctor\u2019s certificate? We\u2019ll have to give him reasonable doubt, and it will take a lot of time and energy to find out if he is really ill or not,\u201d one police inspector told the SCMP.\n\nSo perhaps that\u2019s the solution. Everyone have their doctor\u2019s notes handy?", "description": "The Hong Kong government has banned masks and face paint in its latest attempt to stop the pro-democracy protests that have been raging since June.
