Many talented people left. Those who stuck it out worked under demoralising conditions.\n\nWhat South Africa was left with was a shell of a once proud institution.\n\nOn Friday, government announced that R2.1 billion \u2013 of a R3.2 billion bailout \u2013 would be injected into the broadcaster\u2019s coffers.\n\nThis money is meant to steer the SABC towards the very long path to recovery.\n\nIt will not be easy as the broadcaster still employs people who were rewarded with undeserved promotions for bowing to Hlaudi Motsoeneng and his enforcers.\n\nAs the cash lands in the SABC\u2019s bank tomorrow, it will be expected that the money is used for what National Treasury was told it would be used for.\n\nAny attempt to interfere with the preconditions of the bailout should be fought off with every weapon the executives have at their disposal.\n\nSouth Africa cannot afford to continue to bail out state-owned enterprises that easily allow themselves to be plundered to please politicians.", "description": "For years, the SABC has been allowed to collapse and disintegrate while those put in positions of power used it to line their pockets and please the politicians who facilitated their ascent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7972/34ae6b8d59024e4a9cb1bc5e5a56db9e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
