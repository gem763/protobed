A group of them visited the president earlier Tuesday and explained why they hoped to hear from Mr. Sondland, a person briefed on the meeting said, in part because he has already denied any quid pro quo.\n\nAs Mr. Trump braced for a full-fledged battle, he had lunch on Tuesday with Trey Gowdy, a former South Carolina congressman who has been in talks about joining the president\u2019s legal team. An administration official said Mr. Gowdy, who led the House inquiry into American deaths in Benghazi, Libya, while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, had agreed to represent Mr. Trump, but two others involved in the matter said it was not a done deal.\n\nRepublicans made clear they would not simply rest on defense but would mount a counteroffensive on Mr. Trump\u2019s behalf. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would invite Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who was deeply involved in the pressure campaign on Ukraine, to testify before his panel.\n\nDemocrats did not flinch at the suggestion. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, Mr. Graham\u2019s Democratic counterpart on the committee, said she looked forward to questioning \u201cRudy Giuliani under oath about his role in seeking the Ukrainian government\u2019s assistance to investigate one of the president\u2019s political rivals.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Giuliani said he had not decided whether to appear before Mr. Graham\u2019s committee but would probably follow the White House\u2019s lead and refuse to cooperate with House Democrats. \u201cI think the committee is a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the McCarthy committee on steroids. There\u2019s no sensitivity to civil rights.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s lawyer denounced the House investigation as an illegitimate exercise, and declared that the executive branch would not participate.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Peter Baker", "Michael S.
