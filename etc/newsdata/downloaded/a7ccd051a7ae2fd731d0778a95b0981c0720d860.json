U.S. sanctions really do Russian oil grades good,\" a Western trader said.\n\nAlthough spot premiums for crude have risen across the board, Russian crude grades are being favoured by Asian buyers \"mainly due to freight\", said a Chinese trader.\n\n\"Short-haul cargoes will be attractive,\" he added.\n\nIt takes four days to ship a cargo of ESPO crude from Russian's Kozmino port to China's Shandong port and three days to Japan's Chiba port, according to data on Refinitiv Eikon.\n\nThe Russian cargoes are expected to head to Japan where refiners will ramp up output during fourth quarter to meet peak winter demand, traders said.\n\nThey added that uncertainty over Saudi light crude supplies after the attack is also supporting light crude prices.\n\nOil production at the world's top exporter has rebounded back to 11.3 million bpd and was on track to reach 12 million bpd by the end of November, but some traders said it could take longer to repair the crude oil processing plants.\n\n\"Although the overall output is back it does not mean the supply of Arab Light and Arab Extra Light is back to normal,\" said an Asian refinery source.\n\n\"Some smaller refineries need to buy spot cargoes in advance to hedge the risks.\"\n\n(Reporting By Shu Zhang in Singapore and Olga Yagova in Moscow; Writing by Florence Tan; Editing by Deepa Babington and Mark Potter)", "description": "By Shu Zhang and Olga YagovaSINGAPORE/MOSCOW, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's No.  2 oil producer, has become an unintended beneficiary of U.S. ...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
