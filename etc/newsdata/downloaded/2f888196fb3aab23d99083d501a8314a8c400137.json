[Kelly Olsen/Al Jazeera]\n\nAutumn festival\n\nYasukuni mostly draws international attention three times a year.\n\nOn and around August 15, the anniversary of Japan\u2019s surrender in World War II, when lawmakers, Cabinet ministers and prime ministers have visited.\n\nAnd each April and October when seasonal festivals are held and important rites are performed.\n\nAutumn\u2019s four-day festival began on Thursday with priests and shrine officiants in traditional attire making solemn offerings as visitors, including foreign tourists, took photos beneath the occasional rain shower.\n\nThe festival is taking place just days before new Emperor Naruhito, whose reign began in May, is due to be formally enthroned, and as relations with South Korea, which was a Japanese colony between 1910 and 1945, have deteriorated to their worst state in decades.\n\nThe war criminals\u2019 enshrinement in 1978, helped transform Yasukuni, which marks its 150th anniversary this year, from a largely quiet memorial into a place fraught with political symbolism.\n\nThe wartime Emperor Hirohito, grandson of Emperor Meiji, stopped visiting after that.\n\nPrime ministers have largely stayed away, but not all of them.\n\nYasuhiro Nakasone was the first prime minister to visit, attending Yasukuni in 1985.\n\nJunichiro Koizumi, who was prime minister from 2001 until 2006, visited frequently.\n\nCurrent Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a noted nationalist who has pushed for Japan to take a more assertive diplomatic and military stance, has visited once in his nearly seven years in office, drawing condemnation.\n\nOn Thursday, Seiichi Eto, the minister in charge of Okinawa and Northern Territories affairs, visited the shrine, becoming the first member of the Cabinet to venture there in more than two years.\n\nIt drew a swift rebuke from China.\n\n\"The act of some Japanese politicians again shows the country's erroneous attitude towards its history of aggression,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said.\n\nFormer Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi (second left) often visited Yasukuni triggering condemnation from China, South Korea and Taiwan. [File: Issei Kato/Reuters]\n\nPolitical tool\n\nAkiko Takenaka, associate professor of history at the University of Kentucky in the United States and author of a book on Yasukuni, said that tensions surrounding the shrine tend to wax and wane depending on the nationalistic stance of those in power.\n\nTension rose after Nakasone visited in 1985, but the situation settled down until Koizumi started going, Takenaka said. The emergence of Abe has again brought it to the fore, she added.\n\n\"I think there is a lot of effort on the right to keep it relevant and not let it die out,\" Takenaka said. Further, China and South Korea also use anger over the shrine to \"build and strengthen their nationalism,\" she added.\n\n\"And so it has become this very convenient tool in a way. So I'm not seeing any solutions now.\"\n\nPolitical pragmatism is also a factor.\n\nAbe\u2019s visit, in December 2013, further inflamed tensions with China, already at boiling point over a maritime territorial dispute that saw sometimes violent anti-Japanese protests.\n\nBut ties between the two have gradually improved in recent years and a state-visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected next year.\n\nEven though Abe has shied away from further visits, he generally sends a ritual floral offering, as he did on Thursday.\n\nAnd while emperors do not attend, an imperial emissary visits during the shrine\u2019s spring and autumn festivals.\n\nShrine officials say goodbye to Eiichiro Washio, a member of Japan's lower house of parliament, at a VIP entrance after visiting Yasukuni on Thursday. [Kelly Olsen/Al Jazeera]\n\nA sense of serenity\n\nShinto is just one part of Japan\u2019s multi-layered religious landscape.\n\nThat complexity was on display on Thursday at Yasukuni, when a Japanese Catholic nun passing through the shrine\u2019s grounds paused to bow as she crossed the area in front of its main building as a show of respect for the souls remembered there.\n\nA 79-year-old woman whose father died fighting in China during the war and is enshrined at Yasukuni often meets up with her younger brother to offer prayers.\n\n\"Our father is at rest here,\" she said, adding that because he died when she was just four or five she had no memory of him.\n\nBut she increasingly feels there is something wrong with Yasukuni.\n\n\"As I've come to know how the war came about, I oppose the enshrinement of people who were war criminals,\" she said, declining to give her name for fear she could be severely criticised for such a view.\n\nGiven its martial associations, the shrine is a beacon for those unrepentant for Japan\u2019s actions during World War II.\n\nA museum on the shrine\u2019s grounds provides a nationalist slant on the conflict.\n\nPerhaps because of the political controversy, Chinese tourists, some pulling suitcases on their way to the airport to head home, sometimes visit the shrine.\n\nWhile few were willing to their thoughts, Jimmy Su, a 21-year-old university student from Taiwan who is doing an internship in Japan and is a fan of its anime films and manga comic books, said he was curious to see Yasukuni given his own island\u2019s history as a former Japanese colony and the enmity harboured towards Japan by some Taiwanese.\n\n\"But in fact I feel like I\u2019m just visiting here, that\u2019s all,\" Su said, enamoured of what he described as the site\u2019s calmness and wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\n\"[It's] nothing special.\"", "description": "As Yasukuni marks 150 years since it was founded, the decision to enshrine war criminals casts a shadow over the shrine.", "authors": ["Kelly Olsen"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/18/5985fedfbfd94489bc7b5bbf2c6092c2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
