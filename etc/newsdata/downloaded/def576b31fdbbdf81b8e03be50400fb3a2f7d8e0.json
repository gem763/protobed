Aside from the obvious (sexually transmitted diseases), there\u2019s also the matter of yeast infections.\n\nThrush is a common yeast infection that affects both men and women. The condition is usually harmless, but can be uncomfortable and it can keep coming back.\n\nIt is not considered a sexually transmitted disease, but it can be spread through sex if a person with a vagina or penis has thrush before having sex.\n\nThrush thrives in warm, moist parts of the body such as the genitals and can happen because of tight clothing, underwear and/or hot weather.\n\nWhile it can be spread through sex, or triggered by it (the infection thrives in warm moist spaces remember), thrush isn\u2019t caused by the act.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut oral sex plus using sex toys can also put you at risk of developing the infection.\n\nBut treatment is fairly easy. You can access tablets over the counter at a pharmacy.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of vaginal thrush?\n\nWhite vaginal discharge (like cottage cheese), which does not usually smell\n\nItching and irritation around the vagina\n\nSoreness and stinging during sex or when you pee.\n\nWhat are thrush symptoms in men?\n\nIrritation, burning and redness around the head of the penis and under the foreskin\n\nA white discharge (like cottage cheese)\n\nAn unpleasant smell\n\nDifficulty pulling back the foreskin.\n\nHow do you treat thrush?\n\nUsually, you\u2019ll be given antifungal medicine to get rid of it. This can be in the form of a tablet you take, a tablet you insert into your vagina or a cream to relieve the irritation.\n\nIt should then clear up within a week after one dose of medicine or using the cream daily.\n\nIf you have thrush and are sexually active, you don\u2019t need to treat your partner unless they also show symptoms. But you might want to refrain from sex to lessen the chances of spreading it back and forth.\n\nThrush can affect other areas of skin such as the armpits, groin and between the fingers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis usually causes a red, itchy or painful rash that scales over with white or yellow discharge. The rash may not be so obvious on darker skin.\n\nIf a person has oral thrushes it can also be passed on. The symptoms include white or yellow patches of bumps in your mouth, slight bleeding if the bumps are scraped or soreness and burning.\n\nIf a partner kisses or licks other parts of your body, their bacteria and fungi can spread. This includes your mouth, nipples, and anus.\n\nSometimes thrush causes no symptoms at all.\n\nTreatments and remedies may vary so consult with your doctor for the best solution.\n\nMORE: Woman only has sex with her husband once a year because of painful condition\n\nMORE: Why does sex give you a headache?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Thrush is a common yeast infection that affects men and women.
