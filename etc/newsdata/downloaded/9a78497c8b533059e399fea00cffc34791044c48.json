His home was raided Tuesday night\n\nThe indictment says he also violated U.S. law prohibiting citizens of the Marshall Islands from traveling to the U.S. for the purpose of adoptions. His home was raided Tuesday night\n\nAn investigation last year by the Hawaii news website Honolulu Civil Beat last year questioned the legality of adoptions Petersen administers through his work as a private adoption attorney.\n\nKookie Gideon The Honolulu Civil Beat: 'I thought that everything was going to be OK. But it wasn't until way later that I realized, I should have gone to court.'\n\nThe Compact of Free Associations was designed to protect women in the Marhshall Islands from traveling to the U.S. to adopt out their babies without a special visa by stopping black market deals.\n\nPetersen claims his law practice 'has helped people all across the country in their effort to adopt children' for 15 years.\n\nPetersen is in his second term as assessor following a special election victory in 2014 and re-election in 2016. He served nearly eight years as the assessor's office representative to the Arizona Legislature and as the agency's public information officer.", "description": "Paul Petersen, left, who is licensed in Utah and Arizona, allegedly ran the adoption law practice in Mesa,\u00a0 falsely claiming the women were Arizona residents.
