Jean-Claude Juncker wanted to scrap the switch, but the wait goes on.\n\nIf you forget to change your clocks this weekend, you can probably blame Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nThe outgoing European Commission president last year promised that spring 2019 would be the last time the whole of Europe would have to alter their watches for the bi-annual time change. But now the soonest countries will get around to deciding whether to scrap the change will be 2021, after some capitals complained Juncker\u2019s bid was too much, too soon, without a proper impact assessment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really annoying that things are going on for so long,\u201d said Peter Liese, a German MEP from the center-right European People\u2019s Party. \u201cI am really frustrated that the member states are not doing their job.\u201d\n\nFor many Europeans, the bi-annual clock change is an irritation in spring when it means a shorter night, and a welcome reprieve come the winter season when it means an extra hour in bed. But for others \u2014 especially in Germany, where opposition is high \u2014 it is a pointless switch that disrupts sleep, upends farming regimes and makes the streets more dangerous. It also presents an administrative challenge: Staff at Germany\u2019s rail giant Deutsche Bahn will spend the weekend switching 120,000 clocks back at thousands of stations across the country.\n\nWith uncertainty lingering, Finland \u2014 which currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU, and backs scrapping the time change \u2014 is hoping to get countries in December to commit to making a decision in 2021.\n\nU.K.-based road safety charity Brake estimates there are 10 percent more accidents in the few weeks after the October time switch.\n\nPOLITICO took at look at whether sticking with Sunday\u2019s time change is worth it.\n\nTardiness issues\n\nDaylight saving has the potential to boost demand at ice cream parlors, golf courses and other recreational businesses, along with retailers that can ring up extra sales during sunlit leisure time. But the overall economic picture is debatable.\n\nStock markets have felt the effects, according to a 2000 paper in the American Economic Review. Disrupting traders\u2019 slumber could cost $31 billion, in the form of lower returns for the Friday-to-Monday period around a clock change, the authors argued. While some researchers disputed the trading-hit figures, others have pointed to a more general effect of sleep deprivation, regardless of the season, leading traders to make risky decisions.\n\nA survey from German health insurer DAK said that typically 18 percent of employees are late to work after the time change \u2014 no matter whether the clocks went forward or back.\n\nConfused cows\n\nFarmers are an oft-cited reason in favor of the clock change given it\u2019s designed to maximise the use of daylight hours. In fact, farmers for years remained largely opposed to daylight saving time amid concerns about the impacts on farming schedules and animals\u2019 biorhythms.\n\nThey argue it could reduce milking yields as cows stick to their natural rhythm. \u201cThey are like most humans, they are not receptive to change,\u201d dairy farmer Katie Dotterer-Pyle told the Associated Press last year. \u201cThey are very habitual animals, they like to do the same thing every day.\u201d\n\nMost farmers seem to have bigger things to worry about. The National Farmers' Union of England and Wales said it \u201chas no strong views on whether we should or should not put the clocks back. The last time we tested opinion among our members there was a narrow majority in favor of lighter evenings.\u201d\n\nBut the Commission is continuing its push on behalf of the animals. \u201cFor cows, it\u2019s hard to understand that they need to be milked one hour earlier or later,\u201d Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said when backing Juncker\u2019s proposal.\n\nEvening accidents\n\nEarly dusk means less visibility on the road and more risk of road accidents. U.K.-based road safety charity Brake estimates there are 10 percent more accidents in the few weeks after the October time switch as drivers get used to darker evenings.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion was that the lighter afternoons, evenings you get from sticking to year-round summer time would lead to less road deaths overall in the U.K.,\" said Dudley Curtis from the European Transport Safety Council. However, he cautioned that might not hold in sunnier southern countries.\n\nChanging clocks doesn\u2019t do anything to save the planet these days, even though it was first introduced as part of efforts to limit coal use for lighting.\n\nStudies have pointed to an increase in crime during darker evenings, too.\n\nBad for your health?\n\nJuncker\u2019s effort to end daylight saving came after a record 4.6 million people responded to an EU survey \u2014 some 3 million of them German. Almost one in three Germans say they experience physical and mental discomfort due to the time change, according to the survey from health insurer DAK.\n\nProblems falling asleep and insomnia are among the most common complaints. Some 40 percent of the respondents found themselves less able to focus and a third felt irritable due to the switch.\n\nFranziska Kath, a psychologist at DAK, compared the switch to a \u201csmall jetlag.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe internal clock gets a little confused,\u201d Kath said, although it\u2019s quickly fixed. \u201cThe best medicine is also the simplest: rest and a few days patience.\u201d\n\nNo energy savings\n\nChanging clocks doesn\u2019t do anything to save the planet these days, even though it was first introduced as part of efforts to limit coal use for lighting \u2014 and proposed before that, in the lore of the American founding father Benjamin Franklin, to save candles.\n\nOne popular argument used in favor of the clock change is that it\u2019s supposed to help save energy by providing more light in the early morning during winter. But Germany\u2019s energy industry has long pushed against that claim, arguing that switching times in the year really doesn\u2019t do much to reduce overall energy use.\n\nA study by the Bundestag\u2019s Office of Technology Assessment in 2016 found a decrease of less than 0.8 percent in annual power consumption from lighting. But there were no significant changes from heating. Increasing use of energy-efficient lightbulbs mean they use less energy anyway, further undermining energy saving claims.\n\nLonger days might actually lead to more activities that consume energy. Changing clocks boosted the European leisure sector\u2019s revenue by 3 percent, a 1999 study found.\n\nJohn Rega, Laura Greenhalgh, Carmen Paun, Judith Mischke and Kalina Oroschakoff contributed reporting.\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
