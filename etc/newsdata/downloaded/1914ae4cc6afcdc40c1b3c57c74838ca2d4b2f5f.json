There are few main ways to celebrate Programmer's Day. One is to say something nice to a programmer. Another is to tweet something funny about programmers and/or Programmer's Day.\n\nAnother way to celebrate is to show off that you understand it. Today is Programmer's Day because September 12 is the 256 day of the year.\n\n256 is the equivalent to one \"byte\" of data (or, more precisely, the maximum number of values in one byte, including zero).\n\n256 also translates into the hexadecimal value of 100. Hex is a base-16 number system, a way to express binary numbers in modern computers, and the subject of a lot of programmer jokes.\n\nAnd 256 is also the highest power of two that is less than 365.", "description": "There's a few ways to celebrate Programmer's Day.
