Among those segments, roughly 57 percent \"relied at least in part on information from anonymous sources.\"\n\nComparing the evening news programs, both \"CBS Nightly News\" and \"NBC Nightly News\" tied with approximately 60 percent of their coverage relying on anonymous sources while \"ABC's World News Tonight\" came in at 54 percent.\n\nFLUSTERED RACHEL MADDOW DEFENDS RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AS DURHAM PROBE SHIFTS TO CRIMINAL INQUIRY\n\n\"Every source who talks to a reporter is promoting the facts and spin that best reflects their agenda,\" MRC research analyst Bill D'Agostino wrote in his study. \"When President Trump or House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks on camera, viewers can make up their own minds about how much to trust what is said.

The result is a deluge of hearsay reporting that looks more like a game of telephone than serious journalism.\"", "description": "A new study has found that the majority of coverage dedicated to the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump is based on reports from anonymous sources.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
