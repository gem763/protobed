The nation has seen \u2014 or, really, not seen \u2014 an SMU with a 116-235 record and no more than eight wins in any season since 1989, the year SMU hobbled out of the NCAA crypt that provided infamy in a sport long rich in mischief.\n\nNow here\u2019s an SMU standing 6-0, with a cherished win at TCU, with a 43-37 win over Tulsa on Oct. 5 wrung from a 30-9 deficit after three quarters, with a ranking of No. 19, and with a bout Saturday against Temple.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s an SMU giddy enough to delight even an erstwhile scarecrow.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s just so much fun,\u201d said erstwhile scarecrow Paul Layne, who has attended the past 514 SMU games home and away and very away (Tokyo, Hawaii) and who looks so much younger than his 65 that one wonders whether attending 514 SMU games in a row is some sort of elixir.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be a Mustang,\u201d he continued. \u201cOne thing, I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever live long enough to see it.\u201d\n\nLayne, a former student reporter at SMU who found it too excruciating to refrain from cheering in the press box and thus became an SMU cheerleader, also didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d get anywhere near 514 when, in October 1995, he got one of those unusual diagnoses of chickenpox at age 41 just as SMU fixed to play Rice in the Cotton Bowl. So Layne had to ply some creativity.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Rice defeated SMU 34-24 and dropped SMU to 1-7 along the trail to 1-10, one of the world\u2019s all-time fans watched alone, from the barren rafters of the Cotton Bowl, while dressed as a scarecrow, the costume providing further help against prospective contagion.\n\nClearly, he has earned his turn at giddy SMU.\n\nAt giddy SMU, a Dallas-raised wide receiver with a movie-star smile meets with reporters. James Proche calls the Tulsa fracas \u201cmy favorite game of all time,\u201d and he ranks No. 22 in the country in receiving yards per game (88.2), No. 11 in touchdown catches (seven), No. 8 in receptions (45), coming off a junior year in which he caught a tall 93.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d Proche says. \u201cI\u2019m a Dallas kid through and through, born and raised in DeSoto, played Little League here, and to be able to see this group being able to represent this city and bring SMU back to promise, that\u2019s something that I focused on, and it\u2019s real.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why somebody would go represent somewhere else, instead of building a giant, you know, where they are. You understand?\u201d\n\nHe finishes, whereupon, at giddy SMU, he gives high handshakes and shoulder-bump hugs to all six reporters in sequence.\n\nAt giddy SMU, a fan, Perri Brackett, says she went to get a soda for her husband during the Tulsa game but found the line too onerous. She says they ran out of popcorn. After all, they\u2019re getting more fans now, from 22,766 to 17,489 to 28,142 in three home popcorn games.\n\nAD\n\nAt giddy SMU, the head coach says, \u201cI think our overall depth has been impressive to me.\u201d He speaks of converted cornerback and former UCLA player Brandon Stephens as \u201ca big surprise,\u201d in a program that has mastered college football\u2019s 21st-century \u201ctransfer portal,\u201d roping in 15 such signees. To his credit, the coach can say, \u201cWe played tight, I think, the first half\u201d against Tulsa, and, \u201cI think we coached a little tight.\u201d At giddy SMU, they\u2019re just off a crackerjack of a game in which they converted six consecutive fourth downs, of which Dykes says, \u201cThere\u2019s some teams that won\u2019t convert six fourth downs all year.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd at giddy SMU, a coach from the Hal Mumme-Mike Leach fold who has seen a whole lot of most everything by now, and who has assistant-coached at J.J. Pearce High (in Texas), at Navarro Junior College (in Texas), at Kentucky, at Northeast Louisiana, at Texas Tech, at Arizona, then head-coached at Louisiana Tech, Jared Goff\u2019s California and SMU (with the former Texas quarterback Shane Buechele in command now), can even kid around about, you know, that Tulsa kickoff.\n\nThat Tulsa kickoff caromed around the country\u2019s phone screens after it caromed around the sideline with SMU players unable to corral it until a Tulsa player fell on it in the end zone for a Tulsa touchdown. It looked like one of those nightmares when one cannot pick up a ball or run to first base without stumbling.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Phillips brought it up, Dykes said, \u201cWell . . . hmmm,\u201d and the audience laughed the way audiences can when their team is 6-0.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA great learning experience for us,\u201d he wound up saying.\n\nAt giddy SMU, then, Dykes and staff suddenly face what some coaches, Georgia\u2019s Kirby Smart among them, have called the hardest of all their coaching tasks: keeping young men consistent amid the onus of widespread praise. He speaks of \u201cthe need for people to feel validated,\u201d and says: \u201cSo many of them are accustomed to getting it from social media and from people they don\u2019t even know, which I\u2019ve really always kind of struggled to understand a little bit, why it could be so important to so many young people, to get validation from people that they don\u2019t know. But I think it is, and I think that\u2019s part of, kind of, the society that we live in, to an extent.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAnd so, you know, when guys start getting a lot of praise, you\u2019ve got to do a good job of making sure they understand how quickly it can go away. You know what I mean? I think we\u2019re one of those programs that, if we lose a game, then our shine\u2019s going to go off pretty quickly, and I think our guys understand that. It\u2019s certainly been pointed out to them enough, to where we know we have to fight for every ounce of respect that we get. We\u2019re okay with that.\u201d\n\nIn that vein and others, his players seem to know his sentence structure.\n\nAD", "description": "Reeling for decades after receiving the NCAA \u2018death penalty,\u2019 Mustangs are back in the top 25 under Coach Sonny Dykes.", "authors": ["Chuck Culpepper", "Reporter Who Covers National College Football", "College Basketball", "Tennis", "Golf", "International Sports."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CJlYRXvAJsE1L9g-X879TKmI4Zg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CYXNAZXRF4I6TNSIO26PQ3VWPY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
