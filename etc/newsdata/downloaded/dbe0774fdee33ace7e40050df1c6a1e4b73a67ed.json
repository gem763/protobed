Which is surely about the nicest thing you could say about a person.\n\nAnd upon his re-election (garnering 98.85 per cent of votes cast), the ad man didn\u2019t waste a moment righting his perceived lack of financial commitment, paying $43,750 for 7,000 shares, his first purchase in two years nearly doubling his exposure to the cyclical vagaries of our aviation market. The Toddster now owns 14,095 Qantas shares.\n\nGiven Sampson draws an annual director\u2019s fee (and related benefits) from the Flying Kangaroo of $271,000, the company\u2019s investors will rightly demand he keeps raising the that stake \u2013 and well before they\u2019re asked to vote for him again in 2022.", "description": "The Toddster now owns 14,095 Qantas shares.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/43275e46f2303068fb3f7f3f8e61954328066280", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
