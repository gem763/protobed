What came next was one of the most emotional goodbyes in sports.\n\nWith Hernandez\u2019s contract set to run out after this season, MLB.com\u2019s Greg Johns reported that Thursday\u2019s start would be the former Cy Young winner\u2019s final appearance with the Mariners. He told reporters after the game he does not intend to retire just yet.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say if Hernandez will get another MLB shot with a new team, but it was clearly the end for Hernandez in Seattle.\n\nWith that in mind, the Mariners faithful showed up in force at an expanded King\u2019s Court, and took every opportunity to cheer and chant Hernandez\u2019s name as he pitched. That continued throughout the game, up to a stirring ending for one of the great careers in Seattle history.\n\nFelix visibly emotional making his walk to the dugout after warming up. pic.twitter.com/BGxgUX9tJB \u2014 Dallas Braden (@DALLASBRADEN209) September 27, 2019\n\nAs Hernandez took the mound, he acknowledged it all with his sizable cheering section.\n\nSeattle salutes King Felix pic.twitter.com/zN5ZqimdQl \u2014 Subscribe to Cut4 on YouTube!!!!

The pitcher\u2019s reaction was priceless.\n\nF\u00e9lix approves of this insane catch. \ud83d\ude31 pic.twitter.com/12PEosXAeh \u2014 MLB (@MLB) September 27, 2019\n\nThe pitcher\u2019s night ended in the sixth inning, which began with every fan in the stadium knowing what was happening. Hernandez took the mound one last time, and none of his teammates left the dugout with him. As the music played during his warm-ups, the moment was his alone.\n\nFans chanted \u201cThank you Felix,\u201d Hernandez walked around the mound with tears in his eyes and the pitcher got one last out, a flyout to center. Manager Scott Servais came out to pull Hernandez, who sobbed as he hugged every teammate in sight.\n\nThe King\u2019s reign came to an emotional conclusion as he walked back to the dugout, hugged some more teammates and watched a tribute video begin playing.\n\nThis is why baseball is the best. pic.twitter.com/l2pywVNO93 \u2014 MLB (@MLB) September 27, 2019\n\nHernandez then returned to the field to say goodbye to a group of fans who showed their appreciation for the man who gave them a franchise-record 169 wins, a Cy Young, a perfect game, six All-Star nods and 15 years of memories.\n\nThe festivities continued after the game, when Hernandez returned to the field and embraced his fans.\n\nHail to the King, baby. \ud83d\udc51 pic.twitter.com/OLZQrf6ty8 \u2014 Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 27, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Felix Hernandez's Mariners career came to an emotional end on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/f__w_fOg5VDtfwa6xrWoyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YqKiuackQwGbjGxzokqveQ--~B/aD0yNjA4O3c9MzkxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/1f841830-e0d4-11e9-adfb-8968f48c8c6a", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
