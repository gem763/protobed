Dillashaw was stopped in 32 seconds.\n\nMacDonald, in fact, is one of the best officials in the sport, with a keen knack for when to stop the fight and when to let \u2019em go. MacDonald also stays in the background and doesn\u2019t call attention to himself, which is exactly what a good official is supposed to do, rather than put themselves in the limelight.\n\nSaturday night, MacDonald may have done his job a little bit too well. MacDonald was the third man in on the Bellator 232 lightweight undercard bout between Devin Powell and Marcus Surin.\n\nPowell (10-4 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) finished Surin with a rare front-naked choke at Mohegan Sun Arena (6-2 MMA, 2-2 BMMA) in Uncasville, Conn. That, in and of itself, is worth checking out the clip.\n\nBut then there was the aftermath. MacDonald jumped in immediately as Surin went out. And as Surin came to, in his daze, he shot for a single-leg takedown. We\u2019ve seen a few such moments before, but we\u2019ve never seen someone in Surin\u2019s state deliver the attempt with such accuracy.\n\nMacDonald managed to keep his cool and de-escalate the situation until things calmed down. Which we\u2019re guessing is better than White would have handled the situation. Not too bad for a \u201clocal ref.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc4d or \ud83d\ude34?@DevinPowellMMA finishes things with a front-naked choke as the #Bellator232 Prelims roll on \ud83d\udc4a pic.twitter.com/9ZyZhMvQuB \u2014 DAZN USA (@DAZN_USA) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
