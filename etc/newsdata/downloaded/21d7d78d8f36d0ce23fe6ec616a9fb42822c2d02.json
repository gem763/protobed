Just when the Bengals think their offense can\u2019t get any worse, it reaches new depths.\n\nAnd seven weeks into the season, they\u2019re still winless with no relief in sight.\n\nAndy Dalton threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and the Jacksonville Jaguars pulled away to a 27-17 victory Sunday that extended Cincinnati\u2019s worst start in 11 years.\n\nFirst-year coach Zac Taylor is still awaiting that first win, watching the dwindling fan base get more restless by the week. Several wore bags over their heads Sunday, and a banner in the upper deck played off their \u201cNew Dey\u201d motto for the season by declaring: \u201cFans Are Due Day.\u201d\n\nThey can keep waiting while Taylor tries to figure out how to make something out of the mess, especially the running game. At this point, he\u2019s open to trying anything.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have big enough egos to where it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, this player\u2019s been playing this position,\u2019 or, \u2018We have to continue to do it this way as a coach,\u2019\u201d said Taylor, who calls the plays on offense. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to look at everything.\u201d\n\nEveryone knows where to start.\n\nThe Bengals (0-7) ran for 33 yards during a loss at Baltimore a week ago. They had the same total Sunday, but this time it was worse in how it happened. Dalton accounted for all 33 yards on four scrambles. Running backs Joe Mixon (10 carries, 2 yards) and Giovani Bernard (four carries, no yards) had trouble getting back to the line of scrimmage. Receiver Alex Erickson lost 2 yards on two carries.\n\nWith nothing on the ground, the Bengals have relied on Dalton to do everything. He threw 43 times Sunday, completing 22 for 276 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He also was sacked twice and hit repeatedly.\n\nDalton has thrown 286 times, among the most in the NFL.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re one-dimensional, it makes it easy for the other side to know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Dalton said.\n\nKnowing that Dalton had to throw figured into the Jaguars\u2019 biggest play. Yannick Ngakoue sensed the Bengals would try a screen pass when Bernard - their top receiver out of the backfield - got into the game. The defensive end was in position to grab the floating pass and return it 23 yards for the clinching touchdown.\n\n\u201cI noticed when (Bernard) was in the game, they were looking to pass,\u201d Ngakoue said. \u201cAnd when it was (Mixon), they were looking to run. So I thought it was going to be a screen.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals have been held under 35 yards rushing in four of their seven games. Mixon has only 254 yards. Dalton is their second-leading rusher with 51. The offensive line has been an issue for the last few years, and it\u2019s struggling to create room for running backs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big hole there and at the last second, they\u2019re beating us up front 1-on-1,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThat\u2019s only half of a bad equation.\n\nThe Bengals are not only last in the league in running the ball; they\u2019re also last in stopping the run. Leonard Fournette ran for 131 yards Sunday, and the Jaguars piled up 216 overall on the ground. It\u2019s the third straight game and the fourth time this season that an opponent has rushed for more than 200 yards.\n\nCincinnati has allowed 1,323 yards rushing while managing only 372.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough because we haven\u2019t won a single game,\u201d linebacker Preston Brown said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thirty-three yards rushing, all by the quarterback.
