He wanted to turn her into a police witness.\n\nCurrent chief commissioner Graham Ashton also knew back then, when he headed the independent Office of Police Integrity, which had been set up in 2004 to stamp out police corruption.\n\nNothing has been revealed publicly about what Christine Nixon knew when chief commissioner, preceding Mr Overland.\n\nBoth have provided formal statements to the inquiry and could give evidence before the end of the year.\n\nVictoria Police on Monday refused to comment on whether its process for reporting concerns had changed or not.\n\nIt also refused to comment on delays in publicly releasing documents, including the report outlining officers' concerns, which is one of nearly 350 caught up in a Victoria Police process to remove anything the force says is not in the public interest.\n\nThere's a growing list of 51 statements, more than 150 exhibits and 145 informer contact reports - detailing Ms Gobbo's dealings with handlers - still pending, according to the commission.", "description": "Dozens of police knew about lawyer Nicola Gobbo's dodgy double dealings but one after another, they're claiming it wasn't their job to do anything to stop...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
