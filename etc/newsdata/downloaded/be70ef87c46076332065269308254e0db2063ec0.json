When you back managers, you get stuck with that manager. And I don't want to be stuck to any managers.\n\n\"I want Arsenal to progress and to be able to go and challenge. I don't see it! So, I am calling out Unai Emery, right now because I am not seeing that.\n\n(Image: WILL OLIVER/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"I think we're regressing \u2013 in my opinion, Unai Emery, thanks for trying, but we're going to go a different direction.\n\n\"The board should be getting him out and getting in someone like an [Massimiliano] Allegri or someone of that ilk. Luis Enrique, I like Luis Enrique \u2013 people even mentioned [Mikel] Arteta. What about Patrick Vieira?\"", "description": "Arsenal have looked limp in all competitions this season and Emery is under increasing pressure to turn things around", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Kent Gavin Daily Mirror", "Will Oliver Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20747644.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-London-vs-Vitoria-Guimaraes-United-Kingdom-24-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
