It was first reported on by the technology website MyBroadband.\n\nEmployees within the SAPS have been asked to test the app ahead of its official launch on 11 October, MyBroadband reported an anonymous source as saying.\n\nThe app was created and is managed by Vodacom, apparently based in part on an e-government app called SmartCitizen the cellphone company created last year.\n\nOn first launch My SAPS asks users for their names and cellphone numbers, the ability to record video and audio and take photographs, and access to GPS location data.\n\n\n\nThe GPS data is used to direct users to police stations \u2013 using Google Maps in the backend \u2013 and media access is used in reporting crimes, where users have the option to attach such files.\n\nIn its current form, as Business Insider South Africa tested it on Wednesday morning, the app has some shortcomings.\n\nUsers who want to find the closest police station are presented with an alphabetic list of every police station in the country.\n\nAccessing the map view requires spotting an innocuous icon in the corner of the screen.\n\nThe only other major function of the app is to report crime information to the police.\n\nSuch tipoffs can be submitted under various categories, with fields for the various details that would aid in investigation.\n\n\n\nTipoffs can be submitted anonymously \u2013 if you click the right button.\n\nAnonymous tipoffs are not the default; users have to choose not to transmit the information they provide on registration with the details of the crime they wish to report.\n\nNothing in the app, or the linked terms and conditions on the SAPS website, explain how anonymous reporting works, how information is secured, or why users should trust that the selection will be honoured.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The My SAPS app, which lists police stations and allows for anonymous tipoffs,  quietly appeared in app stores, and it may not be entirely ready for use yet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7815/299f89c6203940678ed3557d27f14ae1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
