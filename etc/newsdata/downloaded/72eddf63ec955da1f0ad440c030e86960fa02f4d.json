REUTERS/Danish Ismail\n\nThe killings were the first since mobile phone services were restored as part of a gradual relaxation of measures taken to curb violent unrest in Jammu and Kashmir state, claimed in whole by India and Pakistan and ruled in part by both.\n\nThe government had cut off telephone and internet lines before it revoked Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s special rights on Aug. 5, striking down long-standing constitutional provisions for the Muslim-majority region.\n\nA security lockdown is still largely in place and broadband and mobile internet connections remain unavailable to most Kashmiris.\n\nThe three militants were killed in a gun battle after soldiers, acting on a tip-off, raided a village in south Kashmir, two police sources told Reuters.\n\n\u201cThree terrorists were killed and the bodies were retrieved from the site of the encounter,\u201d Kashmir police said in a statement. \u201cIncriminating material, including arms and ammunition, was recovered.\u201d\n\nNeither the soldiers or police suffered casualties, according to the police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.\n\nSecurity forces imposed travel restrictions near the site of the gun battle to prevent unrest, the sources said. Many Kashmiris hostile to India\u2019s rule often gather to throw stones at security forces after militants are killed.\n\nIn a separate incident in south Kashmir\u2019s Pulwama district, suspected militants shot dead a migrant worker from Chhattisgarh state, in central India, in an execution-style killing, police said.\n\nThe brick kiln labourer was walking along a railway track in the Kakapora area when he was stopped by two people. \u201cHe was shot in the head,\u201d a police official said, declining to be named.\n\nIn another incident, a fruit merchant was killed and another critically wounded when gunmen fired at them in the Shopian district of south Kashmir.", "description": "Indian security forces killed three separatists, while suspected militants shot dead two people on Wednesday, one of the bloodiest days in Kashmir since New Delhi revoked the disputed region's autonomy more than two months ago.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441504235&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1AP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
