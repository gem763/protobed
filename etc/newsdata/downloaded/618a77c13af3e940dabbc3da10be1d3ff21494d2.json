The studio declined to comment, the Reporter said.\n\nSome believe the Chinese decision stems from Tarantino\u2019s depiction of the late martial arts star Bruce Lee, a hero to many in China. Family and friends have alleged Tarantino wrongly portrayed Lee as a caricature.\n\nSources told the Reporter Lee\u2019s daughter, Shannon Lee, had asked China\u2019s national film administration to demand Tarantino change his characterization.\n\nIn July, Lee told the Wrap her father \u201ccomes across as an arrogant asshole who was full of hot air, and not someone who had to fight triple as hard as any of those people did to accomplish what was naturally given to so many others\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt was really uncomfortable to sit in the theatre and listen to people laugh at my father.\u201d\n\nTarantino \u2013 who is notoriously opposed to fiddling with his films and maintains final-cut rights in his contracts \u2013 does not plan to co-operate with Chinese authorities, the Reporter said.\n\nThe film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt and centers on events preceding the grisly Manson family murders in Los Angeles in 1969.\n\nChina\u2019s apparent attempt to control an American entertainment product comes amid its violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The Chinese government has been particularly rankled by prominent Americans who have spoken out against censorship or its response to the protests.\n\nThe South Park creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have lampooned China\u2019s leaders, and Americans willing to look past human rights violations, in several recent episodes. China has reportedly scrubbed South Park from streaming and social media platforms.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood review \u2013 uneven ode to a lost era Read more\n\nThe NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, claimed on Thursday that Chinese officials wanted the Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey fired, after he tweeted support for the Hong Kong protesters. China\u2019s foreign ministry denied making this request, the Associated Press said.\n\nControversy over Morey\u2019s comments has damaged the lucrative relationship between the NBA and China and drawn in the league\u2019s most famous player. Asked to comment, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a \u2026 feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke.\n\n\u201cJust be careful what we tweet \u2026 even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.\u201d", "description": "Sources tell Hollywood reporter Bruce Lee\u2019s daughter raised concerns over the film\u2019s portrayal of the martial arts star", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa92dd39dfeef4052d8c237ed88d869442c3a90e/0_0_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5cd70aaf568b73be57fb9c3bd4724fe2", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
