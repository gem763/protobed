We\u2019ve concluded the deal and there is no argument on further delay.\u201d\n\nHowever numerous commentators have pointed out Mr Juncker does not have the power to take an extension off the table. Instead his intervention is viewed as a move to pile extra pressure on MPs to back the deal.\n\nAll 27 member states would have to agree to block an extension - a decision that is highly unlikely if the alternative was a no-deal Brexit, which would be economically damaging to the EU.\n\n\u2018A great new deal\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister tweeted on Thursday morning: \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great new deal that takes back control \u2014 now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\u201d\n\nMr Juncker said the deal was a \u201cfair and balanced agreement\u201d and urged the EU Council to back it.\n\nBoris Johnson shakes hands with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at EU headquarters in Brussels.

Mr Barnier told a press conference that Mr Johnson is confident he can get a deal through Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 Where there is a will, there is a #deal - we have one! It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions. I recommend that #EUCO endorses this deal. pic.twitter.com/7AfKyCZ6k9 \u2014 Jean-Claude Juncker (@JunckerEU) October 17, 2019\n\nThe Prime Minister now faces the enormous challenge of persuading MPs to back his revised deal.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have confirmed they will vote against Mr Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nIt is extremely difficult to see how the PM will now be able to drum up enough support the get the deal approved.\n\nThe party said in a statement: \u201cFollowing confirmation from the Prime Minister that he believes he has secured a \u2018great new deal\u2019 with the European Union the Democratic Unionist Party will be unable to support these proposals in Parliament.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Unionist Party has worked since the referendum result to secure a negotiated deal as we leave the European Union. We have been consistent that we will only ever consider supporting arrangements that are in Northern Ireland\u2019s long-term economic and constitutional interests and protect the integrity of the Union.\u201d", "description": "Politicians in Westminster and Brussels will now vote on the draft agreement later this week.", "authors": ["Matilda Long"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZiNAmwKiSA4XdkDrllbd0g--~B/aD0yNzAwO3c9NDA1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/60dfa840-ef60-11e9-9fcf-7a9f3259822c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
