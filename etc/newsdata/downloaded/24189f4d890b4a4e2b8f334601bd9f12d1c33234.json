The best TV cliffhangers of all time 1/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Gliding Over All\" (2012) Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass \u2013 a gift from Gale to Walter White. \u201cTo my other favorited WW. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.\u201d And with that, as Hank realises Walt\u2019s true identity, the end of Heisenberg\u2019s empire begins. AMC 2/37 The Sopranos \u2013 \u201cMade In America\u201d (2007) The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It's a seemingly banal occasion \u2013 a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It\u2019s an ending that\u2019s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television \u2013 and a cliffhanger that\u2019ll never have a resolution. HBO 3/37 EastEnders \u2013 The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001) \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do \u2018cause you ain\u2019t my muvva\u201d / \u201cYES I AM!\u201d - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation\u2019s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn\u2019t Zoe\u2019s sister at all, but her mum. BBC 4/37 Game of Thrones \u2013 \"The Rains of Castamere\" (2013) Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn\u2019s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating. HBO 5/37 Dallas \u2013 \"A House Divided\" (1980) The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman\u2019s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months \u2013 the time between seasons \u2013 the whole world was asking \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode \u201cWho Done It\u201d. CBS 6/37 The Simpsons \u2013 \"Who shot Mr Burns?\" (1995) Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series\u2019 best. FOX 7/37 Doctor Who \u2013 \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible \u2013 especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt\u2019s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston\u2019s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: \u201cBefore I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what \u2013 so was I.\u201d Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation\u2019s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. \u201cSo, where was I? That\u2019s it \u2013 Barcelona.\u201d BBC 8/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Full Measure\" (2010) Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White\u2019s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale \u2013 an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring. AMC 9/37 The West Wing \u2013 \u201cWhat Kind of Day Has it Been\u201d (2000) The West Wing\u2019s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: \u201cWho\u2019s been hit?\u201d NBC 10/37 Smallville \u2013 \u201cCovenant\u201d (2004) It wasn\u2019t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans\u2019 patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family\u2019s farm. \u201cYou shall be reborn,\u201d Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn\u2019t the alone one; the ending marked a radical turning point for the series. The WB 11/37 Twin Peaks \u2013 \u201cThe Last Evening\u201d (1990) Twin Peaks\u2019 season two finale \u2013 the mystery drama\u2019s last episode for 27 years \u2013 may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant. ABC 12/37 Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 \"The Gift\" (2001) The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show\u2019s most shocking moments (and no, we\u2019re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy\u2019s tombstone, which reads: \u201cBeloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.\u201c The WB 13/37 True Blood - \"Plaisir d'Amour\" (2008) It's easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he's a shapeshifter. HBO 14/37 The Walking Dead \u2013 \"Last Day on Earth\" (2016) After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book\u2019s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan \u2013 in retaliation for the death of one of his gang \u2013 decides which one to kill by using \u201cEeny Meeny Mino Moe\u201d. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker. AMC 15/37 The Leftovers \u2013 \"Ten Thirteen\" (2015) Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof's HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world\u2019s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season's penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer \u2013 only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What\u2019s more is they\u2019re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season. HBO 16/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d (2005) In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast. ABC 17/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cTwo for the Road\u201d (2006) \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost\u2019s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets. ABC 18/37 Lost - 'Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Part 2\" Whether you love or hate Lost, there\u2019s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he\u2019d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines. 19/37 Line of Duty \u2013 Series four premiere (2018) The fourth series of Line of Duty didn\u2019t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer \u2013 Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) \u2013 sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz\u2019s eyes suddenly open. 20/37 Heroes \u2013 \u201dThe Butterfly Effect\u201d (2008) After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli \u2013 parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter \u2013 tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she\u2019s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: \u201cBut I am dear, I am.\u201d A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode. NBC 21/37 Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Zoomin\u2019 Who?\u201d (2005) After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along. ABC 22/37 Green Wing \u2013 \u201cEmergency\u201c (2004) Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term \u201ccliffhanger\u201d quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he\u2019d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 off a cliff. Channel 4 23/37 Dexter \u2013 \u201cThe Getaway\u201d (2009) A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita\u2019s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season. Showtime 24/37 Battlestar Galactica \u2013 \u201cKobol's Last Gleaming: Part 2\u201d (2005) When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar \u2013 a warship belonging to the enemy \u2013 crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show\u2019s main character. ABC 25/37 Babylon 5 \u2013 \u201cZ\u2019ha'dum\u201d (1996) Having been warned for two seasons that Z\u2019ha\u2019dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called \u201cZ\u2019ha\u2019dum\u201d. They weren\u2019t wrong. It ended with the show\u2019s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased \u201cZ minus 14 days\u201d and \u201cZ minus 7 days.\u201d PTEN 26/37 24 \u2013 \u201cDay 5: 10:00pm \u2013 11:00pm\u201d (2006) 24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one \u2013 arriving at the 16 episode mark \u2013 stands out for sparking what would be the show\u2019s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show\u2019s most memorable villain was born. FOX 27/37 Friends \u2013 \"The One with Ross\u2019s Wedding\" (1998) While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel\u2019s (Jennifer Aniston) \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fianc\u00e9 Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily\u2019s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: \u201cTake thee Rachel\u201d. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good. NBC 28/37 The X-Files \u2013 \"Anasazi\" (1995) \u201cI\u2019m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,\u201d says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder\u2019s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away? FOX 29/37 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \u2013 \"Fall\" (2016) \u201cIt certainly wasn't the ending I expected,\u201d Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. \u201cFitting but frustrating\u201d, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). \u201cMum\u201d, the daughter says, sitting in a park\u2019s bandstand. \u201cYeah\u201d, she replies. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle. Netflix 30/37 Star Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 \"Best of Both Worlds\" (1990) Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise\u2019s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard\u2019s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved \u2013 and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime. Paramount 31/37 The OC \u2013 \"The Dearly Beloved\" (2005) Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan\u2019s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things \u201conce and for all\u201d between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap\u2019s song \u201cHide and Seek\u201d \u2013 AKA the \u201cMmmmh, what you say?\u201d song \u2013 suddenly starts playing. It\u2019s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what\u2019s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time. Fox 32/37 The Office US \u2013 \"Casino Night\" (2006) Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode\u2019s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not). NBC 33/37 Alias \u2013 \"The Telling\" (2003) JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show\u2019s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d ABC 34/37 Spooks \u2013 \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (2003) The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission \u2013 to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated \u2013 we soon discover that everything\u2019s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many. BBC 35/37 Dragon Ball Z \u2013 Next time on Dragon Ball Z There\u2019s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with \u201cNext time on Dragon Ball Z\u201d, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode. Cartoon Network 36/37 Pushing Up Daisies \u2013 \u201cKerplunk\u201d (2009) Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters\u2019 story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts\u2019 doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she\u2019s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come \u2013 and they still want them desperately. 37/37 Sherlock \u2013 \"The Reichenbach Fall\" (2012) Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series \u2013 plus Martin Freeman\u2019s Watson \u2013 were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special. 1/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Gliding Over All\" (2012) Karma for killing Gale comes for Walter White in season five. The meth maker believes his days of cooking are long over. Having lunch with his family, everything seems perfect. And then everything goes wrong. So, so wrong. Hank (Dean Norris) goes to use the toilet and picks up a copy of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass \u2013 a gift from Gale to Walter White. \u201cTo my other favorited WW. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, GB.\u201d And with that, as Hank realises Walt\u2019s true identity, the end of Heisenberg\u2019s empire begins. AMC 2/37 The Sopranos \u2013 \u201cMade In America\u201d (2007) The debate over whether certain final scenes of television shows are actually good will rage on and on. The Sopranos remains front and centre of the conversation. It's a seemingly banal occasion \u2013 a restaurant dinner scene. We watch on as Tony sits there, observing other customers. Carmela arrives, then AJ and Meadow, who the last we see, is parking her car outside. A bell rings, Tony looks up and the screen cuts to black. It\u2019s an ending that\u2019s inspired essays offering varied interpretations but ultimately, it remains a beautifully-executed few minutes of television \u2013 and a cliffhanger that\u2019ll never have a resolution. HBO 3/37 EastEnders \u2013 The Kat and Zoe revelation (2001) \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me what to do \u2018cause you ain\u2019t my muvva\u201d / \u201cYES I AM!\u201d - not the work of Shakespeare, granted, but surely one of the biggest moments in soap history. The nation\u2019s jaws collectively dropped as they learned that Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) wasn\u2019t Zoe\u2019s sister at all, but her mum. BBC 4/37 Game of Thrones \u2013 \"The Rains of Castamere\" (2013) Game of Thrones knew George RR Martin was willing to kill off leading characters, but nothing prepared non-book readers for The Red Wedding. Robb Stark (Richard Madden), Talisa Stark (Oona Chaplin) and Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley) are attending the wedding of Roslin Frey (Alexandra Dowling) and Edmure Tully (Tobias Menzies) when things go terribly, terribly wrong for the Starks. The Freys turn on them, killing Robb, Talisa and their unborn child. Then, as the blood spills everywhere, Catelyn\u2019s throat is slit. Cut to black. Devastating. HBO 5/37 Dallas \u2013 \"A House Divided\" (1980) The cliffhanger that kickstarted the end of season cliffhanger trend. Larry Hagman\u2019s oil baron JR Ewing had made plenty of enemies in Dallas. By the end of season three, one of them took justice into their own hands, shooting JR in the back twice. However, rather than reveal the culprit, the team behind Dallas left the case unsolved. And over the next eight months \u2013 the time between seasons \u2013 the whole world was asking \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d Unsurprisingly, considering the hysteria around the mystery, 350 million people tuned in to watch the revelatory episode \u201cWho Done It\u201d. CBS 6/37 The Simpsons \u2013 \"Who shot Mr Burns?\" (1995) Showrunner Matt Groening had long wanted to do an episode where Mr Burns was shot, and the culprit was not revealed until the next episode. Taking inspiration from Dallas, the animation concluded Part One with the nuclear power plant owner being shot by an unknown assailant. Then, after a Summer of waiting, fans were finally treated to the answer. The two-part episode has gone down as a classic and is often heralded as the series\u2019 best. FOX 7/37 Doctor Who \u2013 \"The Parting of the Ways\" (2005) Choosing one standout Doctor Who cliffhanger is almost impossible \u2013 especially when you consider that all 37 (and counting) seasons have frequently used the plot device. While the introduction of John Hurt\u2019s Doctor certainly ranks among them, one of best came at the end of the rebooted first series. Having absorbed a bunch of vortexes, the Doctor is struggling and on the verge of regenerating. Turning to Rose (Billie Piper), Christopher Eccleston\u2019s incarnation of the iconic character utters the timeless lines: \u201cBefore I go, I just want to tell you, you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And you know what \u2013 so was I.\u201d Queue shoddy CGI and the introduction of the soon-to-be nation\u2019s favourite Doctor, David Tennant. \u201cSo, where was I? That\u2019s it \u2013 Barcelona.\u201d BBC 8/37 Breaking Bad \u2013 \"Full Measure\" (2010) Gale (David Costabile) is one of the nicest characters on Breaking Bad. He is not interested in wealth or fame, but in science. However, niceties and a good cup of coffee are not enough to stop him getting in Walter White\u2019s (Bryan Cranston) way. When the choice between their lives has to be made, Walter chooses his own and sends Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) to do the dirty work. Season three ends with Jesse killing Gale \u2013 an incident that eventually brings down the drug kingpin Gus Fring. AMC 9/37 The West Wing \u2013 \u201cWhat Kind of Day Has it Been\u201d (2000) The West Wing\u2019s biggest cliffhanger came in the season one finale. The episode works its way back from the beginning as we see a Secret Service Agent sense danger from a nearby window at a town hall meeting with the president in attendance. When the episode catches up, gunfire rings out and each member of his senior staff is thrown to the floor. Cut to black as we hear an agent ask over the radio: \u201cWho\u2019s been hit?\u201d NBC 10/37 Smallville \u2013 \u201cCovenant\u201d (2004) It wasn\u2019t until the third season finale of Smallville that Superman fans\u2019 patience was rewarded as viewers saw Clark (Tom Welling) appear naked in the middle of a Kryptonian symbol burned into the field of his family\u2019s farm. \u201cYou shall be reborn,\u201d Jor-El can be heard saying to Clark Kent, but he wasn\u2019t the alone one; the ending marked a radical turning point for the series. The WB 11/37 Twin Peaks \u2013 \u201cThe Last Evening\u201d (1990) Twin Peaks\u2019 season two finale \u2013 the mystery drama\u2019s last episode for 27 years \u2013 may have featured the most chilling cliffhanger, but the biggest gasp of the series came at the end of season one as the seemingly untouchable Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) responds to a knock on his hotel room door, only to be gunned down by an unseen assailant. ABC 12/37 Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2013 \"The Gift\" (2001) The 100th episode of Buffy ended with one of the show\u2019s most shocking moments (and no, we\u2019re not talking about the musical episode). Season five concluded with the eponymous ass-kicker sacrificing herself to save the world by jumping into a demonic portal. The episode ends with a slow zoom onto Buffy\u2019s tombstone, which reads: \u201cBeloved sister. Devoted friend. She saved the world. A lot.\u201c The WB 13/37 True Blood - \"Plaisir d'Amour\" (2008) It's easy to forget that True Blood began life as an acclaimed Emmy-nominated drama, and it was a cliffhanger such as this that made it so: Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) falls asleep with the friendly neighbour dog Dean for company. Upon waking up, Dean is gone and in his place is local barman Sam Merlotte ( Sam Trammell). Turns out he's a shapeshifter. HBO 14/37 The Walking Dead \u2013 \"Last Day on Earth\" (2016) After eight episodes of build-up, the comic book\u2019s deadliest villain, Negan, reared his head in a scene fans were dreading. With the majority of the main cast lined up at his mercy, Negan \u2013 in retaliation for the death of one of his gang \u2013 decides which one to kill by using \u201cEeny Meeny Mino Moe\u201d. After selecting his victim, the camera switches POV and Negan bludgeons the unseen character to death leaving fans with a six-month wait before finding out who had met their maker. AMC 15/37 The Leftovers \u2013 \"Ten Thirteen\" (2015) Lost co-creator Damon Lindelof's HBO drama was set in a world that saw two per cent of the world\u2019s population disappear into thin air during a tragic event known as the Sudden Departure. Season two presented an intriguing mystery: the disappearance of three teenage girls from a Texan town that nobody had vanished from. It was the season's penultimate episode that cleared up this plot line as Matt Garvey (Chris Zylka) breaks into a heavily-guarded trailer \u2013 only to be met with the three teenage girls staring back at him. What\u2019s more is they\u2019re dressed all in white, a callback to the disbanded cult from the first season. HBO 16/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cDeus Ex Machina\u201d (2005) In episode 11, the writers had introduced a hatch buried underground and, week in week out, the fans waited patiently for any detail about the mysterious structure the writers were willing to give them. The end of episode 19 saw a desperate John Locke (Terry O\u2019Quinn) banging on the door, just as desperate to get inside as the viewers were... only for a light to come on from within. This ending remains an unforgettable moment for those who watched it at the time of broadcast. ABC 17/37 Lost \u2013 \u201cTwo for the Road\u201d (2006) \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d BANG. On paper, not so effective but on screen, it equated to one of Lost\u2019s most gasp-inducing cliffhangers. Viewers watched behind their eyes as Michael (Harold Perrineau), desperate to save his son from the mysterious Others, shoots Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) and, in a cruel twist, Libby (Cynthia Watros), who has accidentally stumbled upon the whole thing while looking for some blankets. ABC 18/37 Lost - 'Through the Looking Glass \u2013 Part 2\" Whether you love or hate Lost, there\u2019s no denying that the season three finale deployed one of the most breathtaking rug pulls in television history as writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse revealed a shake-up long in the running: flashbacks featuring a suicidal Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) were, in fact, flashforwards to the future. The Oceanic Flight 815 plane crash survivor made it off the island he\u2019d been so desperate to get off for three whole seasons, but was, disturbingly, desperate to get back. The ending set the benchmark for all future finale and was so huge it made newspaper headlines. 19/37 Line of Duty \u2013 Series four premiere (2018) The fourth series of Line of Duty didn\u2019t hold back on the shocks. In fact, its first episode featured a cliffhanger ending to rival the best of them. With DCI Roz Huntley (Thandie Newton) dead on his floor, her murderer \u2013 Forensic Coordinator Tim Ifield (Jason Watkins) \u2013 sets about dispatching her body, but as his chainsaw nears her face, Roz\u2019s eyes suddenly open. 20/37 Heroes \u2013 \u201dThe Butterfly Effect\u201d (2008) After season one, Heroes became pretty dreadful television. But this cliffhanger looms in the memory for being so left-field it warrants applaud: having captured serial killer Sylar, Angela Petrelli \u2013 parent to superheroes Nathan and Peter \u2013 tells him she can provide him with the love and guidance he needs. Angry, Sylar tells her she\u2019s not his mother to which Angela drops the bombshell: \u201cBut I am dear, I am.\u201d A head-scratching mid-season reveal that had fans chomping at the bit for the next episode. NBC 21/37 Grey\u2019s Anatomy \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s Zoomin\u2019 Who?\u201d (2005) After spending an entire season watching the blossoming romance between medical intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Dr Derek Shephard (Patrick Dempsey), the world of viewers was rocked upon discovering the shock revelation that Derek was married all along. ABC 22/37 Green Wing \u2013 \u201cEmergency\u201c (2004) Channel 4 sitcom Green Wing took the term \u201ccliffhanger\u201d quite literally for each finale of its two series. While it became a tad gimmicky the second time around, the first remained a genuinely surprising way for a comedy series to end: having discovered that the colleague he\u2019d just slept with was his mother, drug-addled anaesthetist Guy Secretan (Stephen Mangan) steals an ambulance, drives it to the country and loses control. After crashing, the episode ends with Guy and several other characters dangling \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 off a cliff. Channel 4 23/37 Dexter \u2013 \u201cThe Getaway\u201d (2009) A particularly nail-biting fourth season was shaping up to end well: after weeks of playing cat-and-mouse with the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow on Emmy-winning form), Dexter finally put an end to his murderous ways and returned home ready to pack up and join his wife Rita on their vacation. Only Rita\u2019s still at home... dead in the bathtub. Trinity killed her before Dexter got to him. A heartbreaking end to a standout season. Showtime 24/37 Battlestar Galactica \u2013 \u201cKobol's Last Gleaming: Part 2\u201d (2005) When things are going supremely well towards the end of a season finale, you know something big is about to go down. Battlestar Galactica proved no different. After destroying the Cylon Basestar \u2013 a warship belonging to the enemy \u2013 crew member Boomer, who viewers had learnt was a Cylon in the mini-series that aired the year before, fires a round into the chest of Commander Adama (Edward James Olmos), the show\u2019s main character. ABC 25/37 Babylon 5 \u2013 \u201cZ\u2019ha'dum\u201d (1996) Having been warned for two seasons that Z\u2019ha\u2019dum means death, fans expected big things from an episode called \u201cZ\u2019ha\u2019dum\u201d. They weren\u2019t wrong. It ended with the show\u2019s lead character jumping to his death. The episode was so big the episodes leading up to it teased \u201cZ minus 14 days\u201d and \u201cZ minus 7 days.\u201d PTEN 26/37 24 \u2013 \u201cDay 5: 10:00pm \u2013 11:00pm\u201d (2006) 24 was filled to the brim with huge cliffhangers, but this one \u2013 arriving at the 16 episode mark \u2013 stands out for sparking what would be the show\u2019s best run of episodes. President Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin) is revealed to be the mastermind behind the shocking assassinations of David Palmer and Michelle Dessler, which kickstarted the season. And thus the show\u2019s most memorable villain was born. FOX 27/37 Friends \u2013 \"The One with Ross\u2019s Wedding\" (1998) While Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel\u2019s (Jennifer Aniston) \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d courtship arguably went on far too long, there was one moment during the season four finale that left fans with their jaws on the floor. Just after Rachel had accepted Ross was happy with fianc\u00e9 Emily (Helen Baxendale), everything goes catastrophically wrong. Instead of saying Emily\u2019s name during the wedding vows, Ross says the iconic line: \u201cTake thee Rachel\u201d. After the wedding, as the season finished, everyone was left wondering whether the pair would finally rekindle their romance for good. NBC 28/37 The X-Files \u2013 \"Anasazi\" (1995) \u201cI\u2019m in a boxcar, buried inside a quarry, and there are bodies everywhere,\u201d says Mulder to Scully during the season two finale. And just as Mulder solves the riddle of how those people died, the roof of the boxcar slams shut, trapping him inside. Worse still, the Smoking Man then arrives with a unit of soldiers. When they open the boxcar, Mulder\u2019s somehow nowhere to be seen and they decide to blow the freight to smithereens. Did Mulder survive? Did he get away? FOX 29/37 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \u2013 \"Fall\" (2016) \u201cIt certainly wasn't the ending I expected,\u201d Rory Gilmore actor Alexis Bledel said of the finale. \u201cFitting but frustrating\u201d, was how Vanity Fair referred to the episode. The Gilmore Girls sequel, A Year in the Life, concluded with a four-word exchange between Rory and her mother, Lorelai (Lauren Graham). \u201cMum\u201d, the daughter says, sitting in a park\u2019s bandstand. \u201cYeah\u201d, she replies. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d Rory says. Queue hundreds of fans wanting more from the story, which had, ultimately, come full circle. Netflix 30/37 Star Trek: The Next Generation \u2013 \"Best of Both Worlds\" (1990) Another science fiction show filled to the brim with cliffhangers. Star Trek: The Next Generation had many, but few can measure up to Picard (Patrick Stewart) becoming a Borg. The season three finale sees the Enterprise\u2019s crew having no choice but to turn on their former captain, with Riker (Jonathan Frakes) ordering Worf (Michael Dorn) to open fire on Picard\u2019s Borg ship. Fans had to wait three months to discover whether Picard could be saved \u2013 and the fandom almost imploded in the meantime. Paramount 31/37 The OC \u2013 \"The Dearly Beloved\" (2005) Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) and Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie) would have done anything for each other. When Ryan\u2019s brother Trey (Logan Marshall-Green) gets in the way, attacking Marissa, Ryan has no other course of action but to settle things \u201conce and for all\u201d between them. As the brawl ensues, Marissa somehow ends up shooting Trey. And as the bullet goes through him, Imogen Heap\u2019s song \u201cHide and Seek\u201d \u2013 AKA the \u201cMmmmh, what you say?\u201d song \u2013 suddenly starts playing. It\u2019s hard not to laugh. The pop song cuts through the scene, completely at odds with what\u2019s happening on screen. No wonder, then, that Saturday Night Live famously parodied the scene in one of their most-beloved skits of all time. Fox 32/37 The Office US \u2013 \"Casino Night\" (2006) Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam (Jenna Fischer) were the ultimate \u201cwill they, won\u2019t they\u201d couple, their chemistry electrifying the early seasons of The Office. Things peaked for the first time during the season two finale. Following Casino Night at Dunder Mifflin, Jim finally takes Pam aside to reveal his true feelings, telling her: \u201cI\u2019m in love with you.\u201d She is, at the time, engaged to Roy (David Denman), and decides to reply to Jim: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d While all hope for the pair seems lost, Jim finds Pam (calling her mother) before the episode\u2019s end and kisses her. Cruelly, the showrunners decided to cut to black after the moment, leaving fans wondering for months whether the couple would return to screens happily together (spoiler: they do not). NBC 33/37 Alias \u2013 \"The Telling\" (2003) JJ Abrams loves ending things on a twist. Before creating the mystery-box filled Lost, the filmmaker created Alias, and the season two finale marks one the show\u2019s greatest endings. The episode sees Sydney (Jennifer Garner) discover that Francie (Merrin Dungey) is not Francie at all, but a duplicate. The two then brawl, ending with Sydney shooting Francie and then collapsing due to exhaustion. We immediately jump to Sydney waking up in Hong Kong. After reuniting with her lover Michael Vaughn (Michael Vartan), Sydney realises things are amiss as Michael is wearing a wedding ring. Turns out, she has been missing for almost two years. Cut to black, and the world asking \u201cWhat just happened?\u201d ABC 34/37 Spooks \u2013 \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (2003) The season two finale of Spooks shocked the nation. While the episode begins with the CIA taking on a seemingly straightforward mission \u2013 to prevent a member of the Cabinet being assassinated \u2013 we soon discover that everything\u2019s not as it seems. The formerly-presumed dead Herman Joyce (Tomas Arana) is still alive and masquerading as Herb Zeigler. Not only that, but the villain has masterminded an elaborate plan to make it seem as if Tom (Matthew Macfadyen) has assassinated the Chief of the Defence Staff. With everything working against Tom, the agent finds himself backed into a corner. And when Harry (Peter Firth) loses faith, Tom decides to shoot Harry with his shotgun. Does Harry die? Will Tom ever be found innocent? The questions were many. BBC 35/37 Dragon Ball Z \u2013 Next time on Dragon Ball Z There\u2019s really no definitive Dragon Ball Z cliffhanger, as almost every single episode in the series finishes with one. From Vegeta staring menacingly at the camera to the villainous Cell launching a deadline attack on Goku, the series leaves you anywhere and everywhere. When that voice-over comes in with \u201cNext time on Dragon Ball Z\u201d, you can guarantee any child watching will be hooked and instantly wanting to watch the next episode. Cartoon Network 36/37 Pushing Up Daisies \u2013 \u201cKerplunk\u201d (2009) Pushing Up Daisies was unceremoniously brought to an end after just two seasons, with showrunner Bryan Fuller having to quickly conclude the whimsical series with very little notice. The epilogue was added late into the writing process and sees the narrator offer some closure to each characters\u2019 story. Yet, with Ned (Lee Pace) and Chuck (Anna Friel) standing on her aunts\u2019 doorstep, waiting to finally reveal that she\u2019s alive, fans could see that there were originally supposed to be many more seasons to come \u2013 and they still want them desperately. 37/37 Sherlock \u2013 \"The Reichenbach Fall\" (2012) Following a war of words with Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) on the roof of a building (in which Moriarty shoots himself in the head), Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to seemingly commit suicide by jumping off the building. However, not all is at it seems, as Sherlock is seen alive before the episode end. Fans of the series \u2013 plus Martin Freeman\u2019s Watson \u2013 were left questioning what exactly happened to Sherlock, with all being revealed in the following special.\n\nWhich TV shows have been nominated for the top prizes?\n\nGame of Thrones picked up a historic 32 nominations this year, winning a heap at last week\u2019s Creative Arts Emmys ceremony. It looks set to win even more tonight despite the eighth and final season proving divisive among fans. Could Better Call Saul, Pose or Succession pip it to the post? It seems very unlikely at this stage.\n\nAnother show nominated for its final season is Veep. The Emmys have made a habit of awarding shows for their final seasons, so expect awards galore for the Julia Louis-Dreyfus comedy series.\n\nIn terms of Limited Series, Chernobyl is the one to beat, but it\u2019ll face stiff competition in the form of Netflix\u2019s When They See Us and Fosse/Verdon, which looks set to pick up a trophy for Michelle Williams.\n\nThe acting awards are less certain. While voters could opt for the popular nominees \u2013 GoT stars Clarke and Harington \u2013 it does seem like an underdog could reign supreme. Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul) and Jodie Comer (Killing Eve) would both receive one hell of a cheer should either of them win.\n\nSaying this, it would be great to see Headey, Coster-Waldau and van Houten get recognised for their supporting work in Game of Thrones.\n\nThen there\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Sian Clifford who could very well make UK headlines with several wins for Fleabag.\n\nYou can find the full nominations list below:\n\nLead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie:\n\nMahershala Ali, True Detective\n\nBenicio Del Toro, Escape at Dannemora\n\nHugh Grant, A Very English Scandal\n\nJared Harris, Chernobyl\n\nJharrel Jerome, When They See Us\n\nSam Rockwell, Fosse / Verdon\u200b\n\nLead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie:\n\nAmy Adams, Sharp Objects\n\nPatricia Arquette, Escape at Dannemora\n\nAunjanue Ellis, When They See Us\n\nJoey King, The Act\n\nNiecy Nash, When They See Us\n\nMichelle Williams, Fosse / Verdon\n\nLead Actor in a Comedy Series:\n\nDon Cheadle, Black Monday\n\nMichael Douglas, The Kominsky Method\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nEugene Levy, Schitt's Creek\n\nAnthony Anderson, black-ish\n\nTed Danson, The Good Place\n\nLead Actress in a Comedy Series:\n\nChristina Applegate, Dead To Me\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus, Veep\n\nNatasha Lyonne, Russian Doll\n\nCatherine O'Hara, Schitt's Creek\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag\n\nLead Actor in a Drama Series:\n\nJason Bateman, Ozark\n\nSterling K Brown, This Is Us\n\nKit Harington, Game of Thrones\n\nBob Odenkirk, Better Call Saul\n\nBilly Porter, Pose\n\nMilo Ventimiglia, This Is Us\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Game of Thrones characters - ranked Show all 70 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Game of Thrones characters - ranked 1/70 70. Rickon Stark Played by: Art Parkinson : Art Parkinson Easily the most annoying Stark child \u2212 an impressive feat next to Bran \u2212 Rickon was at least handed one hell of a death scene: taken out by an arrow courtesy of Ramsay Bolton. HBO 2/70 69. Robin Arryn Played by: Lino Facioli : Lino Facioli Robin Arryn is remembered by most Thrones fans as being the 10-year-old breastfed by his mother (still weird). That's about it. HBO 3/70 68. Renly Baratheon Played by: Gethin Anthony : Gethin Anthony The Rickon of the Baratheon brothers. His claim to the Iron Throne was tenuous, considering his older brother, Stannis, was still alive. When Stannis's shadow monster came to kill him, it was only good news for the show. HBO 4/70 67. Leaf Played by: Kae Alexander : Kae Alexander A lot of mystery may surround Leaf, one of the show's mythical Children of the Forest, but her noble sacrifice to save Bran, Meera and Hodor from a horde of wights robbed her of any worth. HBO 5/70 66. Tommen Baratheon Played by: Dean-Charles Chapman : Dean-Charles Chapman Another boring younger brother. Whereas Joffrey was pure evil, Tommen was innocent and, inevitably, very boring. His cat, Ser Pounce, was an asset to the show. HBO 6/70 65. Lysa Arryn Played by: Kate Dickie : Kate Dickie Lysa, the creepy sister to Catelyn Stark, was first seen with Robin Arryn, her 10-year-old son, latched to her breast. Her death \u2212 being pushed through the Moon Door \u2212 couldn't have come sooner. HBO 7/70 64. Benjen Stark Played by: Joseph Mawle/Matteo Elezi : Joseph Mawle/Matteo Elezi Having gone missing in season one, Benjen returned during season six to save his nephew, Bran. The moment was a surprise to TV watchers \u2212 book readers, however, had long speculated that Coldhands was an undead version of the Stark. HBO 8/70 63. Syrio Forel Played by: Miltos Yerolemou : Miltos Yerolemou The ill-fated Syrio's appearance way back in season one was a formative experience for one Arya Stark (Maisie Williams); he's the one who helped her on her way to becoming the vengeful assassin fans know and love today. HBO 9/70 62. Jeor Mormont Played by: James Cosmo : James Cosmo Father of Jorah Mormont, Jeor was an honourable leader of the Night's Watch \u2212 perhaps to a fault. After giving Jon Snow the sword Longclaw, Mormont inadvertently showed the Stark bastard that Valerian steel can cut through White Walkers. HBO 10/70 61. Roose Bolton Played by: Michael McElhatton : Michael McElhatton Let's be honest: it's hard to really like as scheming a character as Roose Bolton, the man who orchestrated the violent Red Wedding \u2212 the most infamous scene in the show's six-year history that saw the death of Robb, Catelyn and Talisa. HBO 11/70 60. Ellaria Sand Played by: Indira Varma : Indira Varma Ellaria Sand may have been a more enticing creation on the page, but in the series, her screen time regrettably amounts to reacting to loved ones being killed off in increasingly awful ways. HBO 12/70 59. Grand Maester Pycell Played by: Julian Glover : Julian Glover The secretly sprightly Pycell had seen a lot of things in his time, but there's an element of \"unfulfilled potential\" surrounding Glover's character whose late betrayal of Cersei Lannister saw a grisly end to his life of luxury at King's Landing. HBO 13/70 58. Three-Eyed Raven Played by: Max von Sydow : Max von Sydow Perhaps it was the casting of Max von Sydow that heightened anticipation for the Three-Eyed Raven in the series, but the half-hearted story arc left a lot to be desired. HBO 14/70 57. Gilly Played by: Hannah Murray : Hannah Murray Gilly's long journey from Craster's Keep to Winterfell sounds exciting on paper. But, unfortunately, she has been merely a passenger on Sam's journey for far too long. HBO 15/70 56. Daario Naharis Played by: Michael Huisman : Michael Huisman The man who won the heart of Daenerys Targaryen, only to be left behind in Essos. Ed Skrein originally played the character, but was soon replaced after the actor landed a role in Deadpool. HBO 16/70 55. Shae Played by: Sibel Kekilli : Sibel Kekilli Oh Shea. Her ill-fated betrayal \u2212 sleeping with Tywin (Charles Dance) \u2212 was a slap in the face not just for lover Tyrion, but the viewer also. HBO 17/70 54. Grey Worm Played by: Jacob Anderson : Jacob Anderson Leader of the Usullied, Grey Worm remains unmoved at all times \u2212 unless around Missandei. While their romance can be heartwarming, it's hard to invest in two characters who are so wooden. HBO 18/70 53. Talisa Maegyr Played by: Oona Chaplin : Oona Chaplin To be fair to Robb Stark's wife Talisa, should she have avoided being murdered in arguably the most horrific way during the Red Wedding, she would most likely have been higher on this list. Alas. HBO 19/70 52. Shireen Baratheon Played by: Kerry Ingram : Kerry Ingram All the Greyscale-suffering Shireen ever wanted to do was read stories in her chamber, but due to her impressionable power-hungry father, Stannis, she was tragically reduced to ashes after being sacrificed to the Lord of Light. HBO 20/70 51. Viserys Targaryen Played by: Harry Lloyd : Harry Lloyd Viserys wanted the Iron Throne at any cost, giving away his own sister in exchange for an army. Dany, though, had other plans. Her new husband, Khal Drogo, covering Viserys in molten gold made for one of the show's most memorable death scenes. HBO 21/70 50. Maester Luwin Played by: Donald Sumpter : Donald Sumpter The kindly Maester Luwin was one of the nicest characters in the first few seasons, becoming a stand-in father for Bran and Rickon while the Starks endured horrors elsewhere. He was eventually killed when Ramsay Bolton took over Winterfell. HBO 22/70 49. Thoros of Myr Played by: Paul Kaye : Paul Kaye Thoros spent the majority of his time on the show resurrecting Beric and was most recently seen wielding his flaming sword alongside Jon Snow beyond the wall. HBO 23/70 48. Mance Rayder Played by: Ciar\u00e1n Hinds : Ciar\u00e1n Hinds Ciaran Hinds brought an intensity to Mance Rayder, a character who would otherwise have got lost in the crowd. As a result, his death at the hands of Melisandre was unexpectedly affecting. HBO 24/70 47. Podrick Payne Played by: Daniel Portman : Daniel Portman Ever loyal, Podrick Payne has become a fan favourite for being surprisingly brave in the face of adversity. He and Brienne of Tarth make an excellent duo. HBO/Helen Sloan 25/70 46. Euron Greyjoy Played by: Pilou Asb\u00e6k : Pilou Asb\u00e6k While Euron Greyjoy may have only joined the show in season six, his presence was immediately felt. A wildcard character, Greyjoy's cut-throat, power-hungry nature has proven exciting to watch. HBO 26/70 45. Jaqen H'ghar Played by: Tom Wlaschiha : Tom Wlaschiha Jaqen H'ghar \u2212 one of the Faceless Men of Braavos \u2212 had such promise, but ultimately ended up being the one responsible for sapping Arya's story of the energy she'd had seasons before, alongside The Hound (Rory McCann). HBO 27/70 44. Missandei Played by: Nathalie Emmanuel : Nathalie Emmanuel Missandei has somehow managed to come up trumps within the new world order, being an advisor to Dany. However, her stilted nature can make for some awkward encounters \u2212 but at least she and Grey Worm are happy together. HBO 28/70 43. Ygritte Played by: Rose Leslie : Rose Leslie Ygritte \u2212 the Wildling lover of Jon Snow \u2212 will go down in Thrones lore for providing the series the with oft-quoted famous line: \"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\" Spoken with a northern accent, obviously. HBO 29/70 42. Hot Pie Played by: Ben Hawkey : Ben Hawkey Has an actor ever been more suited to a role? Ben Hawkey, after all, has gone on to run a bakery of his own, even selling Thrones-themed goods. HBO 30/70 41. Walder Frey Played by: David Bradley : David Bradley One of the orchestrators of the Red Wedding, Walder Frey was a lurching, terrifying villain. When Arya unmasks herself and kills the old man, it's a sweet, sweet moment of revenge. HBO 31/70 40. Gendry Baratheon Played by: Joe Dempsie : Joe Dempsie The true heir to the Iron Throne. Gendry may have spent a few seasons rowing out at sea, but his return hints at big things to come for the Baratheon bastard. HBO 32/70 39. Robert Baratheon Played by: Mark Addy : Mark Addy Mark Addy brought a certain gravitas to Robert Baratheon, making him a believably world-weary king. Despite only having a few scenes, his character's presence is still felt on the show thanks to Gendry. HBO 33/70 38. Barristan Selmy Played by: Ian McElhinney : Ian McElhinney After being fired by the Lannisters, Selmy pledged allegiance to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), bridging the gap between two of the show's key characters. He was also a bloody good warrior. HBO 34/70 37. Yara Greyjoy Played by: Gemma Whelan : Gemma Whelan Lily Allen was initially wanted for the role of Theon's sister. However, she declined: 'I felt uncomfortable because I would have had to go on a horse and he would have touched me up and s***.' Seeing as Allen's brother, Alfie, had already been cast as Theon, it was probably for the best. HBO 35/70 36. Margaery Tyrell Played by: Natalie Dormer : Natalie Dormer Margaery Tyrell was one of Game of Thrones's biggest players, wheedling her way into the Lannister family politics and actually becoming Queen for a spell. Her number was up the moment she made an enemy of Cersei, and her fiery death, while underwhelming, was a huge moment. HBO 36/70 35. Samwell Tarly Played by: John Bradley : John Bradley There's a theory going around that Samwell Tarly, who trains as a maester, is actually the author of the Song of Ice and Fire \u2212 AKA the book series. In other words, Sam is George RR Martin. Go figure. HBO 37/70 34. Osha Played by: Natalia Tena : Natalia Tena The underused Osha was our very first wildling, an unpredictable knife-wielding danger to the characters we loved. Her subsequent evolution into Stark servant was interestingly played, which made the fact she was sidelined for multiple seasons, before being brought back just to be unceremoniously offed, a travesty. HBO 38/70 33. Ramsay Bolton Played by: Iwan Rheon : Iwan Rheon Ramsey cut off Theon's penis and sent it to the Greyjoy's father. He imprisoned and raped Sansa Stark. He killed Rickon Stark in front of his brother. And Ramsay eventually died by being fed to his own dogs. A terrifying death for a terrible human. HBO 39/70 32. Night King Played by: Richard Brake, Vladim\u00edr Furd\u00edk : Richard Brake, Vladim\u00edr Furd\u00edk The embodiment of evil. Why, exactly, the Night King marches South to destroy mankind remains somewhat a mystery. But, whatever the reason, he's a terrifying foe. Winter has, as the Starks say, finally come. HBO 40/70 31. Beric Dondarrion Played by: Richard Dormer : Richard Dormer Beric danced on the outskirts of the series until its third season when he surfaced as the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners. His introduction paved the way for the Lord of Light's ability to resurrect the dead, a mystical sub-plot that would become very important for Jon Snow. HBO 41/70 30. Bran Stark Played by: Isaac Hempstead Wright : Isaac Hempstead Wright It says a lot that Bran Stark has become marginally more interesting since he sacrificed his personality in favour of becoming the spiritualistic heart of the series. His role in the final season looks set to be a huge one what with the long-standing theory that he could become the fearsome Night King. HBO 42/70 29. Theon Greyjoy Played by: Alfie Allen : Alfie Allen While Theon starts as a cocky kid, after being neutered by Ramsay he becomes the annoyingly weak Reek. Thankfully, Theon comes back around again in the later seasons, but not without us still hating his guts for not saving Sansa sooner. HBO 43/70 28. The High Sparrow Played by: Jonathan Pryce : Jonathan Pryce While at first a seemingly wise old man, the High Sparrow quickly becomes a tactical villain, using his newfound powers under King Tommen to turn King's Landing into his own domain. HBO 44/70 27. The Mountain Played by: Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson : Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson The hulking Clegane brother known as The Mountain \u2212 now a zombie-esque servant to Cersei \u2212 may not have come face-to-face with lots of characters in the series, but his presence is known by all in Westeros. His biggest moment? Battering poor Oberyn's head into mush. HBO 45/70 26. Khal Drogo Played by: Jason Momoa : Jason Momoa To the world he's now Aquaman, but for a brief time, Jason Momoa was Khal Drogo, the beloved Dothraki husband of his Khaleesi, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke). HBO 46/70 25. Jon Snow Played by: Kit Harington : Kit Harington Every show needs a hero, and they do not come more obvious than Jon Snow. Rising from discarded bastard to King of the North, his climb has been one of the show's best storylines. A shame, then, that Snow can be such a bland person, doing only what is right and seemingly having no faults. HBO 47/70 24. Stannis Baratheon Played by: Stephen Dillane : Stephen Dillane With his propensity to make tough decisions for the greater good, Stannis could have been a heroic warrior. However, the Baratheon brother's continual fall from grace \u2212 including sacrificing his own daughter and murdering his own brother \u2212 were horrendous decisions that eventually doomed him. HBO 48/70 23. Hodor Played by: Kristian Nairn : Kristian Nairn Once you get over the fact that Kristian Nairn was essentially getting paid to repeat the word \"Hodor\" over and over, it's hard to deny that Bran Stark's protector was a heartwarming addition to the show. His death \u2212 the breathtaking \"Hold the Door\" sequence \u2212 will go down as one of the show's most memorable moments. HBO 49/70 22. Tywin Lannister Played by: Charles Dance : Charles Dance Stannis was a horrible father. His two favourite children became incestuous lovers, and he blamed his youngest for the death of his wife. Without Tywin, though, the Lannister family would not be nearly as riveting as they are to watch. HBO 50/70 21. Tormund Giantsbane Played by: Kristofer Hivju : Kristofer Hivju Tormund has some of the best lines in the series, particularly when expressing his admiration for Brienne. Here's one of the least explicit: \"I want to make babies with her. Think of it. Great big monsters. They'll conquer the world!\" HBO 51/70 20. Daenerys Targaryen Played by: Emilia Clarke : Emilia Clarke \"Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.\" Every time Dany meets someone new, she forces Missandei to read out her entire CV. I guess everyone would if theirs was as impressive. Dany really has had a great journey to the top \u2212 a shame she could not have come to Westeros slightly earlier. HBO 52/70 19. Olenna Tyrell Played by: Dianna Rigg : Dianna Rigg Olenna's scenes were always ones to cherish. The Queen of Thorns was as cunning as the best of them and seemed like she could worm her way out of any situation, all from the comfort of her own chair. HBO 53/70 18. Jorah Mormont Played by: Iain Glen : Iain Glen Poor Ser Jorah. Dany may be 25 years younger than him, but that never stopped the disgraced warrior from loving her. He even fought off Grey Scale to fight by her side. If that's not true love, then what is? HBO 54/70 17. Davos Seaworth Played by: Liam Cunningham : Liam Cunningham Liam Cunningham's performance as the curt Davos Seaworth has quietly been one of the best things about the series since his introduction. As Jon Snow's kingly advisor, he's recently seen himself thrust into the heart of the series and, simply put, Game of Thrones would be a less enjoyable show without him. HBO 55/70 16. Melisandre Played by: Carice van Houten : Carice van Houten Lest we forget that Melisandre is actually a shrivelled old witch who has been manipulating men for hundreds of years. Her faith in the Lord of Light, though, could very well be misplaced. HBO 56/70 15. Oberyn Played by: Pedro Pascal : Pedro Pascal Few shows can bring in characters midway through their run that have such an impact as Oberyn. The Viper quickly became a fan favourite, and his death remains one of the show's most squirm-inducing moments. HBO 57/70 14. Eddard \"Ned\" Stark Played by: Sean Bean : Sean Bean Killing off a main character during a show's first season was practically unheard of before Game of Thrones. Yet, as dictated by George RR Martin's books, they cut off Sean Bean's head without a second thought, setting the tone for everything to come. No death has impacted the Thrones quite as much since. HBO 58/70 13. Varys Played by: Conleth Hill : Conleth Hill Early on in the series, it was hard to pin down Varys, a slippery eel of a character who has \"little birds\" fluttering around Westeros, feeding back crucial information. Going into the final season, his true intentions are clear: he's all for Daenerys taking the Iron Throne, even if he doesn't live to see the day (\u201cI have to die in this strange country, just like you,\" Melisandre prophesied last season). HBO 59/70 12. Bronn Played by: Jerome Flynn : Jerome Flynn Perhaps the show's best wise-cracking side-kick, Bronn only has one loyalty: money. Paired with either of the Lannister lads, Tyrion or Jaime, Bronn makes for excellent company. HBO 60/70 11. Robb Stark Played by: Richard Madden : Richard Madden Before Bodyguard, Richard Madden was the extremely temporary king of Westeros. Robb was a man of honour, trying to bring light to the Thrones universe. He was a likeable presence who ruled with his heart, an act that ultimately saw him die during the infamous Red Wedding in season three. HBO 61/70 10. Brienne of Tarth Played by: Gwendoline Christie : Gwendoline Christie Brienne is a reassuring force of good in a world filled with scheming layabouts. She's also one of the most deadly. Her time on the series has been spent protecting the likes of Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark and Jaime Lannister, the latter of which made for an interesting turn as it put her at odds with her loyalty. HBO 62/70 9. Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish Played by: Aidan Gillen : Aidan Gillen There would be no Game of Thrones without Littlefinger. The silver-tongued manipulator had Jon Arryn killed, setting off a snowball that turned into an avalanche. As smart as he may have been, Littlefinger was finally outplayed by his own pupil, Sansa Stark. HBO 63/70 8. Sansa Stark Played by: Sophie Turner : Sophie Turner Sansa has perhaps had the most interesting story arc of any character on Thrones. Beginning as a clich\u00e9d annoying teenager, she gradually became a stone-cold killer, capable of holding Winterfell and outsmarting even Littlefinger. With any luck, she could sit upon the Iron Throne when the war is over. HBO 64/70 7. Arya Stark Played by: Maisie Williams : Maisie Williams Arya Stark, arguably the greatest character of the first few seasons, was one of the biggest victims of the series overtaking George RR Martin's source material. Her limited screen time, due to being away from the central action, robbed us of classic moments that we're grateful she's been a part of in an otherwise lacklustre season eight. HBO 65/70 6. Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane Played by: Rory McCann : Rory McCann From his regular delivery of the phrase\"F** the king\" to that chicken scene, The Hound is a reckless creation whose high ranking on this list can be attributed to the searing performance from Rory McCann. Most effective when paired with Arya Stark. HBO 66/70 5. Joffrey Baratheon Played by: Jack Gleeson : Jack Gleeson No character has been as hated by the fandom as Joffrey. His wicked ways and disgusting behaviour haunted the show's first four seasons. You never knew what was going to come next: whether he was about to behead your favourite character or start crying to his mother. It made for thrilling television. But, as The Hound says, \"F**k the King\". HBO 67/70 4. Catelyn Stark Played by: Michelle Fairley : Michelle Fairley The lady of Winterfell, Catelyn Stark, became the show's honorary lead after the untimely beheading of her husband, Ned (Sean Bean) at the end of season one. As she tried to take control of spiralling events in the second and third run, Thrones was handed its most resilient character. Michelle Fairley's guttural cry of anguish before meeting her tragic end during the Red Wedding will always be the show's most horrific moment. HBO 68/70 3. Jaime Lannister Played by: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau : Nikolaj Coster-Waldau If the characters above Jaime in this list are the show's greatest characters, Jaime is the show's most disarming. The Lannister brother \u2212 the Kingslayer \u2212 started the series as a long-haired bad guy of the tallest order, but his humbling over the past few seasons have seen him inch his way into the hearts of viewers. HBO 69/70 2. Tyrion Lannister Played by: Peter Dinklage : Peter Dinklage Blamed for the death of his mother and hated for being a dwarf, Tyrion turned to drink and prostitutes to numb the pain. However, Tyrion has a fierce intellect, capable of outsmarting the toughest enemies (and offering cutting lines that George RR Martin says often take weeks to write). More importantly, despite being betrayed and cast away time and time again, Tyrion selflessly only wants the best for the people of Westeros. A true hero. HBO 70/70 1. Cersei Lannister Played by: Lena Headey : Lena Headey The Mad Queen, alone on the Iron Throne. Cersei has, over the course of seven seasons, seen her three children die, driven her lover/brother away, blown up a church with a half dozen major characters inside, arranged the death of her husband (King Robert) and attempted to have her other brother (Tyrion) killed multiple times. Yet, thanks to Lena Headey's empathetic performance, you still feel sorry for the terrifying Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. As one of the most complicated character to have ever reached television screens, there's no denying her place as the best Thrones character to date. HBO 1/70 70. Rickon Stark Played by: Art Parkinson : Art Parkinson Easily the most annoying Stark child \u2212 an impressive feat next to Bran \u2212 Rickon was at least handed one hell of a death scene: taken out by an arrow courtesy of Ramsay Bolton. HBO 2/70 69. Robin Arryn Played by: Lino Facioli : Lino Facioli Robin Arryn is remembered by most Thrones fans as being the 10-year-old breastfed by his mother (still weird). That's about it. HBO 3/70 68. Renly Baratheon Played by: Gethin Anthony : Gethin Anthony The Rickon of the Baratheon brothers. His claim to the Iron Throne was tenuous, considering his older brother, Stannis, was still alive. When Stannis's shadow monster came to kill him, it was only good news for the show. HBO 4/70 67. Leaf Played by: Kae Alexander : Kae Alexander A lot of mystery may surround Leaf, one of the show's mythical Children of the Forest, but her noble sacrifice to save Bran, Meera and Hodor from a horde of wights robbed her of any worth. HBO 5/70 66. Tommen Baratheon Played by: Dean-Charles Chapman : Dean-Charles Chapman Another boring younger brother. Whereas Joffrey was pure evil, Tommen was innocent and, inevitably, very boring. His cat, Ser Pounce, was an asset to the show. HBO 6/70 65. Lysa Arryn Played by: Kate Dickie : Kate Dickie Lysa, the creepy sister to Catelyn Stark, was first seen with Robin Arryn, her 10-year-old son, latched to her breast. Her death \u2212 being pushed through the Moon Door \u2212 couldn't have come sooner. HBO 7/70 64. Benjen Stark Played by: Joseph Mawle/Matteo Elezi : Joseph Mawle/Matteo Elezi Having gone missing in season one, Benjen returned during season six to save his nephew, Bran. The moment was a surprise to TV watchers \u2212 book readers, however, had long speculated that Coldhands was an undead version of the Stark. HBO 8/70 63. Syrio Forel Played by: Miltos Yerolemou : Miltos Yerolemou The ill-fated Syrio's appearance way back in season one was a formative experience for one Arya Stark (Maisie Williams); he's the one who helped her on her way to becoming the vengeful assassin fans know and love today. HBO 9/70 62. Jeor Mormont Played by: James Cosmo : James Cosmo Father of Jorah Mormont, Jeor was an honourable leader of the Night's Watch \u2212 perhaps to a fault. After giving Jon Snow the sword Longclaw, Mormont inadvertently showed the Stark bastard that Valerian steel can cut through White Walkers. HBO 10/70 61. Roose Bolton Played by: Michael McElhatton : Michael McElhatton Let's be honest: it's hard to really like as scheming a character as Roose Bolton, the man who orchestrated the violent Red Wedding \u2212 the most infamous scene in the show's six-year history that saw the death of Robb, Catelyn and Talisa. HBO 11/70 60. Ellaria Sand Played by: Indira Varma : Indira Varma Ellaria Sand may have been a more enticing creation on the page, but in the series, her screen time regrettably amounts to reacting to loved ones being killed off in increasingly awful ways. HBO 12/70 59. Grand Maester Pycell Played by: Julian Glover : Julian Glover The secretly sprightly Pycell had seen a lot of things in his time, but there's an element of \"unfulfilled potential\" surrounding Glover's character whose late betrayal of Cersei Lannister saw a grisly end to his life of luxury at King's Landing. HBO 13/70 58. Three-Eyed Raven Played by: Max von Sydow : Max von Sydow Perhaps it was the casting of Max von Sydow that heightened anticipation for the Three-Eyed Raven in the series, but the half-hearted story arc left a lot to be desired. HBO 14/70 57. Gilly Played by: Hannah Murray : Hannah Murray Gilly's long journey from Craster's Keep to Winterfell sounds exciting on paper. But, unfortunately, she has been merely a passenger on Sam's journey for far too long. HBO 15/70 56. Daario Naharis Played by: Michael Huisman : Michael Huisman The man who won the heart of Daenerys Targaryen, only to be left behind in Essos. Ed Skrein originally played the character, but was soon replaced after the actor landed a role in Deadpool. HBO 16/70 55. Shae Played by: Sibel Kekilli : Sibel Kekilli Oh Shea. Her ill-fated betrayal \u2212 sleeping with Tywin (Charles Dance) \u2212 was a slap in the face not just for lover Tyrion, but the viewer also. HBO 17/70 54. Grey Worm Played by: Jacob Anderson : Jacob Anderson Leader of the Usullied, Grey Worm remains unmoved at all times \u2212 unless around Missandei. While their romance can be heartwarming, it's hard to invest in two characters who are so wooden. HBO 18/70 53. Talisa Maegyr Played by: Oona Chaplin : Oona Chaplin To be fair to Robb Stark's wife Talisa, should she have avoided being murdered in arguably the most horrific way during the Red Wedding, she would most likely have been higher on this list. Alas. HBO 19/70 52. Shireen Baratheon Played by: Kerry Ingram : Kerry Ingram All the Greyscale-suffering Shireen ever wanted to do was read stories in her chamber, but due to her impressionable power-hungry father, Stannis, she was tragically reduced to ashes after being sacrificed to the Lord of Light. HBO 20/70 51. Viserys Targaryen Played by: Harry Lloyd : Harry Lloyd Viserys wanted the Iron Throne at any cost, giving away his own sister in exchange for an army. Dany, though, had other plans. Her new husband, Khal Drogo, covering Viserys in molten gold made for one of the show's most memorable death scenes. HBO 21/70 50. Maester Luwin Played by: Donald Sumpter : Donald Sumpter The kindly Maester Luwin was one of the nicest characters in the first few seasons, becoming a stand-in father for Bran and Rickon while the Starks endured horrors elsewhere. He was eventually killed when Ramsay Bolton took over Winterfell. HBO 22/70 49. Thoros of Myr Played by: Paul Kaye : Paul Kaye Thoros spent the majority of his time on the show resurrecting Beric and was most recently seen wielding his flaming sword alongside Jon Snow beyond the wall. HBO 23/70 48. Mance Rayder Played by: Ciar\u00e1n Hinds : Ciar\u00e1n Hinds Ciaran Hinds brought an intensity to Mance Rayder, a character who would otherwise have got lost in the crowd. As a result, his death at the hands of Melisandre was unexpectedly affecting. HBO 24/70 47. Podrick Payne Played by: Daniel Portman : Daniel Portman Ever loyal, Podrick Payne has become a fan favourite for being surprisingly brave in the face of adversity. He and Brienne of Tarth make an excellent duo. HBO/Helen Sloan 25/70 46. Euron Greyjoy Played by: Pilou Asb\u00e6k : Pilou Asb\u00e6k While Euron Greyjoy may have only joined the show in season six, his presence was immediately felt. A wildcard character, Greyjoy's cut-throat, power-hungry nature has proven exciting to watch. HBO 26/70 45. Jaqen H'ghar Played by: Tom Wlaschiha : Tom Wlaschiha Jaqen H'ghar \u2212 one of the Faceless Men of Braavos \u2212 had such promise, but ultimately ended up being the one responsible for sapping Arya's story of the energy she'd had seasons before, alongside The Hound (Rory McCann). HBO 27/70 44. Missandei Played by: Nathalie Emmanuel : Nathalie Emmanuel Missandei has somehow managed to come up trumps within the new world order, being an advisor to Dany. However, her stilted nature can make for some awkward encounters \u2212 but at least she and Grey Worm are happy together. HBO 28/70 43. Ygritte Played by: Rose Leslie : Rose Leslie Ygritte \u2212 the Wildling lover of Jon Snow \u2212 will go down in Thrones lore for providing the series the with oft-quoted famous line: \"You know nothing, Jon Snow.\" Spoken with a northern accent, obviously. HBO 29/70 42. Hot Pie Played by: Ben Hawkey : Ben Hawkey Has an actor ever been more suited to a role? Ben Hawkey, after all, has gone on to run a bakery of his own, even selling Thrones-themed goods. HBO 30/70 41. Walder Frey Played by: David Bradley : David Bradley One of the orchestrators of the Red Wedding, Walder Frey was a lurching, terrifying villain. When Arya unmasks herself and kills the old man, it's a sweet, sweet moment of revenge. HBO 31/70 40. Gendry Baratheon Played by: Joe Dempsie : Joe Dempsie The true heir to the Iron Throne. Gendry may have spent a few seasons rowing out at sea, but his return hints at big things to come for the Baratheon bastard. HBO 32/70 39. Robert Baratheon Played by: Mark Addy : Mark Addy Mark Addy brought a certain gravitas to Robert Baratheon, making him a believably world-weary king. Despite only having a few scenes, his character's presence is still felt on the show thanks to Gendry. HBO 33/70 38. Barristan Selmy Played by: Ian McElhinney : Ian McElhinney After being fired by the Lannisters, Selmy pledged allegiance to Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), bridging the gap between two of the show's key characters. He was also a bloody good warrior. HBO 34/70 37. Yara Greyjoy Played by: Gemma Whelan : Gemma Whelan Lily Allen was initially wanted for the role of Theon's sister.

He killed Rickon Stark in front of his brother. And Ramsay eventually died by being fed to his own dogs. A terrifying death for a terrible human. HBO 39/70 32.

HBO 44/70 27. The Mountain Played by: Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson : Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson The hulking Clegane brother known as The Mountain \u2212 now a zombie-esque servant to Cersei \u2212 may not have come face-to-face with lots of characters in the series, but his presence is known by all in Westeros. His biggest moment? Battering poor Oberyn's head into mush. HBO 45/70 26. Khal Drogo Played by: Jason Momoa : Jason Momoa To the world he's now Aquaman, but for a brief time, Jason Momoa was Khal Drogo, the beloved Dothraki husband of his Khaleesi, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke).

His death \u2212 the breathtaking \"Hold the Door\" sequence \u2212 will go down as one of the show's most memorable moments. HBO 49/70 22. Tywin Lannister Played by: Charles Dance : Charles Dance Stannis was a horrible father. His two favourite children became incestuous lovers, and he blamed his youngest for the death of his wife. Without Tywin, though, the Lannister family would not be nearly as riveting as they are to watch. HBO 50/70 21. Tormund Giantsbane Played by: Kristofer Hivju : Kristofer Hivju Tormund has some of the best lines in the series, particularly when expressing his admiration for Brienne. Here's one of the least explicit: \"I want to make babies with her. Think of it. Great big monsters. They'll conquer the world!\" HBO 51/70 20. Daenerys Targaryen Played by: Emilia Clarke : Emilia Clarke \"Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons.\" Every time Dany meets someone new, she forces Missandei to read out her entire CV. I guess everyone would if theirs was as impressive. Dany really has had a great journey to the top \u2212 a shame she could not have come to Westeros slightly earlier. HBO 52/70 19. Olenna Tyrell Played by: Dianna Rigg : Dianna Rigg Olenna's scenes were always ones to cherish. The Queen of Thorns was as cunning as the best of them and seemed like she could worm her way out of any situation, all from the comfort of her own chair. HBO 53/70 18. Jorah Mormont Played by: Iain Glen : Iain Glen Poor Ser Jorah. Dany may be 25 years younger than him, but that never stopped the disgraced warrior from loving her. He even fought off Grey Scale to fight by her side. If that's not true love, then what is? HBO 54/70 17. Davos Seaworth Played by: Liam Cunningham : Liam Cunningham Liam Cunningham's performance as the curt Davos Seaworth has quietly been one of the best things about the series since his introduction. As Jon Snow's kingly advisor, he's recently seen himself thrust into the heart of the series and, simply put, Game of Thrones would be a less enjoyable show without him. HBO 55/70 16. Melisandre Played by: Carice van Houten : Carice van Houten Lest we forget that Melisandre is actually a shrivelled old witch who has been manipulating men for hundreds of years. Her faith in the Lord of Light, though, could very well be misplaced. HBO 56/70 15. Oberyn Played by: Pedro Pascal : Pedro Pascal Few shows can bring in characters midway through their run that have such an impact as Oberyn. The Viper quickly became a fan favourite, and his death remains one of the show's most squirm-inducing moments. HBO 57/70 14. Eddard \"Ned\" Stark Played by: Sean Bean : Sean Bean Killing off a main character during a show's first season was practically unheard of before Game of Thrones. Yet, as dictated by George RR Martin's books, they cut off Sean Bean's head without a second thought, setting the tone for everything to come. No death has impacted the Thrones quite as much since. HBO 58/70 13. Varys Played by: Conleth Hill : Conleth Hill Early on in the series, it was hard to pin down Varys, a slippery eel of a character who has \"little birds\" fluttering around Westeros, feeding back crucial information. Going into the final season, his true intentions are clear: he's all for Daenerys taking the Iron Throne, even if he doesn't live to see the day (\u201cI have to die in this strange country, just like you,\" Melisandre prophesied last season). HBO 59/70 12. Bronn Played by: Jerome Flynn : Jerome Flynn Perhaps the show's best wise-cracking side-kick, Bronn only has one loyalty: money. Paired with either of the Lannister lads, Tyrion or Jaime, Bronn makes for excellent company. HBO 60/70 11. Robb Stark Played by: Richard Madden : Richard Madden Before Bodyguard, Richard Madden was the extremely temporary king of Westeros. Robb was a man of honour, trying to bring light to the Thrones universe. He was a likeable presence who ruled with his heart, an act that ultimately saw him die during the infamous Red Wedding in season three. HBO 61/70 10. Brienne of Tarth Played by: Gwendoline Christie : Gwendoline Christie Brienne is a reassuring force of good in a world filled with scheming layabouts. She's also one of the most deadly. Her time on the series has been spent protecting the likes of Renly Baratheon, Catelyn Stark and Jaime Lannister, the latter of which made for an interesting turn as it put her at odds with her loyalty. HBO 62/70 9. Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish Played by: Aidan Gillen : Aidan Gillen There would be no Game of Thrones without Littlefinger. The silver-tongued manipulator had Jon Arryn killed, setting off a snowball that turned into an avalanche. As smart as he may have been, Littlefinger was finally outplayed by his own pupil, Sansa Stark. HBO 63/70 8. Sansa Stark Played by: Sophie Turner : Sophie Turner Sansa has perhaps had the most interesting story arc of any character on Thrones. Beginning as a clich\u00e9d annoying teenager, she gradually became a stone-cold killer, capable of holding Winterfell and outsmarting even Littlefinger. With any luck, she could sit upon the Iron Throne when the war is over. HBO 64/70 7. Arya Stark Played by: Maisie Williams : Maisie Williams Arya Stark, arguably the greatest character of the first few seasons, was one of the biggest victims of the series overtaking George RR Martin's source material. Her limited screen time, due to being away from the central action, robbed us of classic moments that we're grateful she's been a part of in an otherwise lacklustre season eight. HBO 65/70 6. Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane Played by: Rory McCann : Rory McCann From his regular delivery of the phrase\"F** the king\" to that chicken scene, The Hound is a reckless creation whose high ranking on this list can be attributed to the searing performance from Rory McCann. Most effective when paired with Arya Stark. HBO 66/70 5. Joffrey Baratheon Played by: Jack Gleeson : Jack Gleeson No character has been as hated by the fandom as Joffrey. His wicked ways and disgusting behaviour haunted the show's first four seasons. You never knew what was going to come next: whether he was about to behead your favourite character or start crying to his mother. It made for thrilling television. But, as The Hound says, \"F**k the King\". HBO 67/70 4. Catelyn Stark Played by: Michelle Fairley : Michelle Fairley The lady of Winterfell, Catelyn Stark, became the show's honorary lead after the untimely beheading of her husband, Ned (Sean Bean) at the end of season one. As she tried to take control of spiralling events in the second and third run, Thrones was handed its most resilient character. Michelle Fairley's guttural cry of anguish before meeting her tragic end during the Red Wedding will always be the show's most horrific moment. HBO 68/70 3. Jaime Lannister Played by: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau : Nikolaj Coster-Waldau If the characters above Jaime in this list are the show's greatest characters, Jaime is the show's most disarming. The Lannister brother \u2212 the Kingslayer \u2212 started the series as a long-haired bad guy of the tallest order, but his humbling over the past few seasons have seen him inch his way into the hearts of viewers. HBO 69/70 2. Tyrion Lannister Played by: Peter Dinklage : Peter Dinklage Blamed for the death of his mother and hated for being a dwarf, Tyrion turned to drink and prostitutes to numb the pain. However, Tyrion has a fierce intellect, capable of outsmarting the toughest enemies (and offering cutting lines that George RR Martin says often take weeks to write). More importantly, despite being betrayed and cast away time and time again, Tyrion selflessly only wants the best for the people of Westeros. A true hero. HBO 70/70 1. Cersei Lannister Played by: Lena Headey : Lena Headey The Mad Queen, alone on the Iron Throne. Cersei has, over the course of seven seasons, seen her three children die, driven her lover/brother away, blown up a church with a half dozen major characters inside, arranged the death of her husband (King Robert) and attempted to have her other brother (Tyrion) killed multiple times. Yet, thanks to Lena Headey's empathetic performance, you still feel sorry for the terrifying Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. As one of the most complicated character to have ever reached television screens, there's no denying her place as the best Thrones character to date.
