(AP) - Terry Rozier arrived in Charlotte with a tremendous chip on his shoulder.\n\nThe 25-year-old point guard is eager to prove he can lead an NBA team after spending four years as a backup with the Boston Celtics. He will get that opportunity this season in Charlotte where he\u2019ll replace Kemba Walker, the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer, and average more than 30 minutes a game.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t let anything stop me from what I want to do,\u201d Rozier said upon his arrival. \u201cI\u2019m still hungry.\u201d\n\nRozier, who describes himself as \u201ccompetitive as hell,\u201d has a tough task ahead of him replacing an extremely popular player who developed into a three-time All-Star and became the face of the franchise before leaving to join the Celtics.\n\nThe fact that many around the league see the Hornets as a cellar dweller this season only adds fuel to Rozier\u2019s internal fire.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been overlooked,\u201d Rozier said. \u201c\u2026 Us guys in that locker room have each other. We don\u2019t care about the TV or blogs. We control what we can control.\u201d\n\nRozier averaged 9 points and 2.9 assists per game last season for the Celtics in 79 games. Walker averaged 25.6 points per game.\n\nHornets second-year coach James Borrego has made it clear he doesn\u2019t expect Rozier to take on Walker\u2019s scoring load. But Borrego does expect him to take ownership on the court and pave the way for younger players to develop.\n\n\u201cI expect Terry to lead,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cAnd sometimes that is just his effort on the floor, how he comes to work every day. This is a kid who does work hard, and we need him to step up as a leader.\u201d\n\nSome other things to watch with the Hornets this season\u2026\n\nWASHINGTON\u2019S ROLE\n\nRookie PJ Washington has a chance to start right away for the Hornets at power forward. Borrego said he\u2019s impressed with Washington\u2019s feel for the game saying, \u201cHe\u2019s been fantastic.\u201d Said Borrego: \u201cHe picks things up, high IQ, plays the right way and can shoot the ball. It\u2019s been very exciting to watch him so far.\u201d If Washington gets the starting nod over veteran Nic Batum it would allow the team could move Miles Bridges to small forward and start a lineup that includes Rozier, Dwayne Bacon, Bridges, Washington and Zeller.\n\nMONK\u2019S BIG SEASON\n\nThis is an important season for shooting guard Malik Monk, who is still trying to nail down a starting job entering his third season. The knock on Monk has been his well-publicized defensive struggles, which he says are unwarranted. He\u2019s responded by adding 23 pounds this offseason, which he hopes keeps him from getting bumped off the spot on defense. \u201cI feel way different,\u201d Monk said. Borrego has already told players if they aren\u2019t going to commit to playing great defense, they won\u2019t be seeing many minutes.\n\nZELLER\u2019S HEALTH\n\nCody Zeller said he\u2019s feeling better than he has in a long time, and the Hornets will need him to stay healthy to be competitive. The 7-foot center has missed 82 of 164 games over the last two seasons with a myriad of injuries ranging from knee problems to hand fractures to quad bruises. Zeller said he\u2019s tired of the freak injuries and hopes the worst is behind him.\n\nPREVENTING TURNOVERS\n\nTurnovers have been a major issue for the Hornets in the preseason, but Borrego attributes some of that to players playing together for the first time. \u201cThis is a new group playing together for the first time, playing with more base, multiple guys touching it,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to clean up that area. I don\u2019t know if it will be an issue or not, but it has been in the preseason so far.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Terry Rozier arrived in Charlotte with a tremendous chip on his shoulder.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/15/76ers_hornets_basketball_04392_c0-1523-3323-3461_s1200x700.jpg?dbac6696c780c032cd31596ff120a665f74c2b4d", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
