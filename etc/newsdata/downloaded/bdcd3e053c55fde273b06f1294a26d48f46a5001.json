Treasuries and the dollar were steady.\n\nEquities edged higher in Japan and South Korea, and were little changed in Australia. On Friday, the People\u2019s Bank of China said it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to the lowest level since 2007, injecting liquidity into the economy. S&P 500 futures and Treasuries were steady, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s last speech before next week\u2019s policy meeting cemented views for another interest-rate reduction.\n\nAs the U.S.-China trade war rumbles on with more high-level talks expected next month, data over the weekend showed China\u2019s exports unexpectedly contracted in August and last week\u2019s U.S. employment report was weaker than many forecast. With expectations already running high for central banks around the world to offer more support to economies, traders remain on edge.\n\n\u201cThere has been a tremendous rally in bonds and the central banks are the key determinant of what\u2019s going to happen with the rates market,\u201d Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist for multi-asset investing at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cWith equities there is still an element of self-determination.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, the pound was little changed with Boris Johnson not giving up on his Brexit plan, despite the latest Tory defection. The British Prime Minister remains committed to pulling the U.K. out of the EU by the end of next month and may challenge legislation requiring him to ask for a delay if there\u2019s no deal by Oct. 19, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.\n\nMeantime, Typhoon Faxai made landfall near Tokyo early Monday morning, causing widespread disruptions to commuters and cutting off power to around 90,000 homes. In Hong Kong, small pockets of demonstrators on Sunday set fires, vandalized subway stations and set up barricades downtown. Tens of thousands marched peacefully to the U.S. consulate to appeal for help from President Donald Trump.\n\nHere are some key events coming up this week:\n\nThe U.K. Parliament may be suspended as soon as Monday, and a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit could become law. That bill would derail Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s strategy and could trigger the opposition Labour Party to agree to a general election.OPEC\u2019s monthly oil market report, which includes demand forecasts and production estimates, is due Wednesday.The European Central Bank policy meeting Thursday is widely expected to see a cut to interest rates and a review of all options, including QE.
