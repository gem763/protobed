Cost management is a challenge for young and growing firms, which can factor into the dip in credit scores. Latino businesses are thriving and expanding, and they help contribute to the overall strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nIn May, Alfredo Ortiz of the Job Creators Network said that although Democrats claimed the Trump economy was no help to the Hispanic community, the facts revealed the opposite.\n\nOrtiz wrote:\n\nThe fact is that Hispanics are flourishing in the Trump economy. Democrats asserting the contrary is a mere partisan talking point to try to deny Trump the Hispanic support he has earned and which may decide the presidential election outcome next year. Expect Democrats to increase their identity politics attacks in an effort to skew Latinos against Republicans over the next year and a half.\n\nIn September of 2018, Arora called the rapidly expanding Latino community a \u201cpowerful force\u201d and stated that their businesses \u201ccontribute more than $700 billion to the economy annually.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe achievements of Latino small businesses are impressive when you consider it is often hard for them to gain access to capital. Yet they are making progress,\u201d Arora concluded.\n\nFor Kenia Castillo, operator of the popular Canave restaurant in Inwood, New York, it is her dream come true.\n\n\u201cThis is the American Dream for us,\u201d she told the New York Post, adding that \u201cWe keep getting busier and are now looking at expansion.\u201d\n\nThe study found that the top five states for Hispanic owned businesses were California, Texas, New York, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThe growth of Latino businesses is undeniable and will undoubtedly increase as this important group becomes a larger section of the population,\u201d said Manuel Chinea, the COO of Popular Bank.\n\n\u201cBy 2050, Latinos are expected to comprise almost 30% of the population, compared to 18% today,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Latino-owned businesses are growing at a record pace thanks to a strong economy, according to a Biz2Credit study.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/Trump-Happy-IM-WATSONAFPGetty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
