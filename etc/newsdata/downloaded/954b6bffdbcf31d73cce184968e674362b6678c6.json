I\u2019m looking forward to this new journey and hopefully I can contribute as much as I can to the club,\u201d Semenya said in a statement on JVW\u2019s website.\n\nAlthough Semenya will not be registered for the current SAFA Sasol League season, she will continue to train with JVW in preparation for a 2020 debut in the country\u2019s top tier.\n\nSemenya is appealing the Court of Arbitration for Sport\u2019s ruling that supported regulations introduced by the sport\u2019s governing body, the IAAF.\n\nSouth Africa women\u2019s captain Janine van Wyk, who owns the club, said she was delighted to have signed Semenya who took part in a practice session on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely honoured that out of all the other women\u2019s clubs around the world, she has chosen JVW as the club where she would like to start showcasing her football skills,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI look forward to her working with Coach Ciara (Picco) and our first team where I\u2019m sure she will sharpen up and get ready to play in 2020.\u201d\n\nSemenya is not the first athlete in recent times to try to kick-start a soccer career, with Olympic sprint champion Usain Bolt securing a trial at Australian outfit Central Coast Mariners last year.", "description": "Double Olympic champion Caster Semenya could trade her running shoes for soccer boots as early as next year after the 28-year-old signed for South African women's club JVW FC.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1426905492&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF85154-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
