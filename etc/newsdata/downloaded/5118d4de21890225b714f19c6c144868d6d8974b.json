REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe United States blames Iran for an attack on the world\u2019s biggest crude oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia on Sept. 14 and has said they will present evidence to back that up. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has been fighting a Saudi-led military coalition since 2015, has claimed responsibility. Iran denies involvement.\n\nKhan met with Trump on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations on Monday.\n\n\u201cI immediately spoke to President Rouhani yesterday after the meeting with President Trump, but I can\u2019t say anything right now more than this except that we\u2019re trying and mediating,\u201d Khan told reporters at the United Nations on Tuesday.\n\nKhan said he had been in Saudi Arabia before New York and spoken with Prince Mohammed bin Salman who also asked him to talk to Rouhani.\n\nAn already-tense relationship between Iran and the United States has worsened over the past year since Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and world powers, saying it did not go far enough, and reimposed sanctions on Iran as part of a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy.\n\nIn response, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to limit uranium enrichment activity under the pact and plans further breaches if European parties fail to keep their promises to shield Iran\u2019s economy from U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn his speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump said there was a path to peace with Iran while he denounced its leadership for \u201cbloodlust.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Khan\u2019s remarks, Trump said Khan would like to mediate \u201cand we have a very good relationship and there\u2019s a chance that could happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people would like to get us to the table. We\u2019ll see what happens but so far we have not agreed to a meeting,\u201d Trump said on a possible meeting with Rouhani while they are both in New York this week.\n\nKhan also said he had told Trump that he was willing to help broker peace in neighbouring Afghanistan.\n\nHundreds of civilians have been killed in fighting across Afghanistan after the collapse of U.S.-Taliban peace talks this month. The Taliban has said Trump would regret his decision to abruptly call off talks that could have led to a political settlement to end the 18-year-old war.\n\n\u201cWe are trying now to get the talks restarted between Taliban and the Americans and hopefully the deal is signed,\u201d Khan said.\n\n\u201cThen I will try and meet the Taliban to convince them to talk to the Afghan government because until now that\u2019s where the hitch was - Taliban were talking to the Americans but not to the Afghan government,\u201d he said.", "description": "Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump had asked him to help defuse tensions with Iran and that he had already spoken with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an attempt to mediate.", "authors": ["Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433509367&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N232", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
