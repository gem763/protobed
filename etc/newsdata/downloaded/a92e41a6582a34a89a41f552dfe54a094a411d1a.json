As of Friday's close, the shares were off 7.3% for the year. Now, Houston-based Apache (NYSE: ) is up about 7%.\n\nEnergy shares had a great first quarter as Saudi Arabia pushed a campaign to get major oil-producing countries to cut output to boost prices. But the prices \u2013 and the stocks -- slumped in the second quarter and into the third quarter because of the U.S.-China trade battle.\n\nThe situation reversed itself after Saturday's drone attacks on the state-run Saudi Arabian Oil Co.\u2019s (Aramco) Abqaiq plant \u2013 a key crude processing facility \u2013 and the Khurais complex, which houses the kingdom\u2019s second-largest oilfield.\n\nwas up 14.3% at $62.68 a barrel.\n\nApache's outsized gain was due in part because its exposure in the Middle East is limited to production in Egypt, and the company had already been telling investors it will be boosting its Permian Basin production in Texas by a third in the fourth quarter to around 100,000 barrels of oil (and equivalents) per day.\n\nAlso, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) analysts rated Apache (NYSE: ) among companies with \"the greatest 4Q19 potential operating cash flow percentage uplift.\" Others included Hess (NYSE: ), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ) and Cimarex Energy (NYSE: ).\n\nEnergy shares were among the few stock-market sectors showing gains. Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ), up 2.6% and 2.2% respectively, were the top performers among the 30 Dow stocks. The were off 0.47%.\n\nSaudi Arabia produces about 10% of the world\u2019s oil. The disruption could slash Saudi Arabia\u2019s daily oil exports of 7.4 million barrels by as much as three-quarters. The New York Times said Monday the attacks could take roughly 5% of global supplies off the market, unless the Abqaiq facility in particular is quickly repaired.", "description": "StockBeat: Apache Jumps as Oil Soars", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECB60NB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
