There are usually plenty of announcements, but we expect this to be an especially big event. The Surface Pro 7 is almost guaranteed to be unveiled, which hopefully has USB-C charging, among the other usual yearly improvements to processing speed and other internal specs.\n\nRumors suggest that Microsoft will also announce a new Surface Laptop built with AMD processors, and possibly project \u201cCentaurus,\u201d its dual-screened Surface computer. What Microsoft has to show off matters more than ever since Apple recently brought Smart Keyboard support to its most affordable iPad, the seventh-generation version of its standard model. The takeaway is that Apple has raised the stakes in a big way for Microsoft.\n\nHow will Microsoft respond? We\u2019ll be bundling all of the big headlines below, so stay tuned.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s 2019 Surface event is on Wednesday, October 2nd, and it starts at 10AM ET.
