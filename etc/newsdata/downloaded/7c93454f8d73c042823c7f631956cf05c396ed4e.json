You could not go into a community setting where there were not weeping mothers talking about their children.\u201d\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma struck a proposed deal Wednesday with about half the states and thousands of local governments over its role in the crisis. But criticism by several state attorneys general clouded prospects for an end to litigation against the company and the family that owns it.\n\nSome people in Akron say the once-proud rubber capital of the world will never be the same. Hundreds of overdose deaths shattered families, orphaned children, exhausted first responders and drained government resources. At one point, city officials needed a mobile morgue to house all the corpses.\n\nOhio\u2019s fifth-largest city, home to NBA legend LeBron James, and surrounding Summit County, population 540,000, were scheduled to be the first of some 2,000 governments scheduled to go to trial against drugmakers next month. Local officials sought damages from the manufacturers they hold responsible.\n\nOverdose deaths - which hit 340, or nearly one a day, in 2016 - took a toll on the county medical examiner\u2019s budget and her staff. At the height of the scourge, they often had to perform two or more drug-related autopsies in an average day.\n\nDr. Lisa Kohler, the county\u2019s chief medical examiner, recalled \u201cthe mental stress of dealing with repeated cases of having multiple deaths in the same families over a period of weeks to months.\u201d\n\nThe calls about overdose deaths were constant, and \u201cit just felt like it was never going to stop,\u201d Kohler said.\n\nThe need for the mobile morgue laid bare the devastating extent of the crisis. The trailers were originally intended for a mass-fatality event, such as a natural disaster, plane crash or terrorist attack.\n\nAkron Fire Chief Clarence Tucker said it sometimes felt as if his community was under attack.\n\n\u201cWe handle 45,000 calls a year, and it just kept climbing and climbing,\u201d he said. The fire department had to accelerate maintenance schedules on vehicles, mobilize off-duty paramedics and cope with staff burnout.\n\n\u201cYou can get a call someone has overdosed and you get there, you can bring them back with Narcan. Then you\u2019ll go to the same address in the afternoon,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cOr you go to that address in the morning and the two parents have overdosed and there\u2019s a child there. It\u2019s just horrible. It really is.\u201d\n\nSummit County\u2019s estimated payout from the $12 billion tentative Purdue settlement was estimated at $13.2 million. Akron would receive about $3.7 million. Barberton, the county\u2019s second-largest city, would receive $492,000.\n\nThose dollars are intended to compensate for the many financial effects of opioids, including not only the demands on fire, police and medical services, but the crowded jails, the bulging foster-care system, the bursting drug-court dockets, the overloaded addiction programs and the inundated emergency rooms.\n\nSummit County Common Pleas Judge Joy Malek Oldfield sees about 50 felony offenders in her drug court every Monday morning. It\u2019s one of two drug-court dockets totaling 80 to 100 people, about double the number before the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re nearing capacity for both dockets, and most of them are opiate-dependent,\u201d Oldfield said.\n\nIn the past, most drug offenders used crack cocaine or marijuana, and \u201cthe treatment was tailored to those users,\u201d Oldfield said. \u201cIf someone had a bad day and relapsed, they didn\u2019t die.\u201d But opioid addiction requires residential treatment, the judge said.\n\nBy October 2017, the opioid outlook was so bad that County Executive Ilene Shapiro declared an emergency, noting in her proclamation that \u201clocal response efforts have been exhausted and local resources in Summit County have been overwhelmed, and capabilities have been exceeded.\u201d That year, the county saw another 269 overdose deaths.\n\nFor police officers, the crisis meant a slew of extra duties beyond fighting crime, said Barberton Police Chief Vincent Morber.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve had to be everything. Not just law enforcers, but social workers and drug counselors, trying to hook everybody up with resources,\u201d Morber said. \u201cThese poor young officers have done more death notifications in their short time span in 10 years than I have done my whole career.\u201d\n\nThomas Heitic, chef and general manager of the Green Diamond Grille and Pub, said he hoped the settlement would offer more money for addiction counseling.\n\n\u201cAny of this money that goes towards awareness to me is a joke. We\u2019re all aware of what\u2019s going on. Our medical examiner had to bring in refrigerated trucks because the bodies were piling up. We\u2019re constantly aware of this problem. We need to focus, use that money to focus on treatment.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Angie Wang contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The tentative settlement involving the opioid crisis and the maker of OxyContin could mean that thousands of local governments will one day be paid back for some of the costs of responding to the epidemic.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Julie Carr Smyth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/opioid_crisis_one_county_93588_c0-126-3000-1875_s1770x1032.jpg?85e3f3a90d2b6cb216aa7875ca9e51bf768c5416", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
