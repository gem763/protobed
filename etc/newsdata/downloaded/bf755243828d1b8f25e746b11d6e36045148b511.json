Someone clearly had a snack attack.\n\nAccording to research from 2016 by Ipsos (a company that asks people their opinions on products), more than two-thirds of what we eat is outside of traditional meals like breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nTwo-thirds of what we eat are, in fact, snacks.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean two-thirds of our diet is chips, necessarily, but for some people, the chip family probably accounts for some of it.\n\nSo, being part of \"Canadian Snacking Nation\" (this is what Ipsos calls Canada), it probably wouldn\u2019t totally shock you to think Frito-Lay (which makes Cheetos) could release a fashion collection, complete with accessories and makeup inspired by Cheeto dust.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what it did earlier this week at New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe colours of the House of Flamin\u2019 Haute collection were orange, red-orange, light orange and, well, you get the picture \u2014 it was very orange.\n\nA close-up of dyed braids and a flaming top.

Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nAccessories were simple, like a single dangling earring that read Flamin\u2019 Hot in the brand\u2019s signature style.\n\nThere were also flames on shirts and braids dyed so red-orange, it looked like they had been rolled in Cheeto crumbs.\n\nA flaming shirt-dress and a purse full of Cheetos. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nThe collection is very on the nose. For example, the bottom of the shirt-dress above has flames on it because this is a collection inspired by Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos.\n\nAlso, if you look closely, the purse the model is carrying is actually just a purse that\u2019s filled with Cheetos \u2014 and the stylist threw a decal on top.\n\nFlame eye makeup on a model at the House of Flamin Haute show at New York Fashion Week. (Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images)\n\nThere was a lot of attention to detail with the show\u2019s beauty looks.\n\nSome models had flame makeup on their eyelids, which complemented the Cheetos hair clips and hair jewellery.\n\nCheetos-themed braid charms on a model backstage. (Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images)\n\nBut, really, people wondered why this was even happening.\n\nAnother Twitter user quickly replied: \u201cbecause why not.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn't all positivity.\n\nA twitter user posted a GIF that reads \"I am...disgusted.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a good question, though. Why did this happen?\n\nWell, for brand awareness, it seems \u2014 which is primarily why any designer or brand holds a fashion show.\n\nAlso, in this case, it was an opportunity to have influencers design pieces inspired by their favourite snack.\n\nBut if you are at all interested in owning any of these pieces, you can\u2019t.\n\nAs of now, they are one-of-a-kind.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t fun to look at.\n\nIt does, however, mean no red-orange bandana with a sticker on it for you.\n\nA model with hair that looks like Cheeto powder.

Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nJust find a see-through bag and tape an open bag of Cheetos inside.\n\nSame goes for this backpack.\n\nA bag full of snacks. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nFind a see-through backpack and fill it with Cheetos and put stickers on it. If you wanted to do that, for some reason.\n\nThis DIY masterpiece would be a great art project to try at home.\n\nA full dress embellished with cheesy and spicy snacks. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nThis fashion show is an example of a brand wanting attention, for sure. But was there a need for it? There are defintely a lot of fans who would say yes.\n\nFor some, Cheetos are an emotional experience.\n\nA close-up of dyed braids and a flaming top. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nCheetos are so beloved, they are finding their way into unusual food pairings, like ice cream.\n\nA close-up of dyed braids and a flaming top. (Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images)\n\nAnd a movie is being made about the janitor who developed the recipe for Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos.\n\nIf for whatever reason, you wanted a Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos bundt cake, here it is:\n\nSome people just have a hard time saying no.\n\nCheetos culture is real. But is it spectacular? Or does it just make your tummy hurt?\n\nWhat's Fire This Week is your weekly look at what everyone's talking about.", "description": "Cheetos and Frito-Lay House of Flamin\u2019 Haute Collection at New York Fashion Week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/WHATS-FIRE_Sept12_thumbnail.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
