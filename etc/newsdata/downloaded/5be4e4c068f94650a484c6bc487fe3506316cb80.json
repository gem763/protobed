These religious doomsayer prophets receive less publicity than in times past, only to be replaced by environmental doomsayers. Last week, the good folks at the Competitive Enterprise Institute have done a service by publishing a new paper, \u201cWrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions.\u201d Below I have taken a sample of the headlines from among the many articles the CEI staff found (the full list and complete articles can be found on the CEI website, www.CEI.org).\n\n\u201cScientist predicts a new ice age by 21st century\u201d (The Boston Globe, April 16, 1970). \u201cU.S. Scientist Sees New Ice Age Coming\u201d (The Washington Post, July 9, 1971). \u201cSpace satellites show new Ice Age coming fast\u201d (The Guardian, January 29, 1974). \u201cThe Cooling\u201d (New York Times Book Review, July 18, 1976). \u201cAcid Rain Kills Life in Lakes\u201d (Noblesville Ledger, April 9, 1980). \u201cAcid rain no environmental crisis, study concludes\u201d (Associated Press, September 6, 1990). \u201cRising seas to obliterate nations by 2000\u201d (Associated Press, June 30, 1989). \u201cNew York City\u2019s West Side Highway under water by 2019\u201d (Salon.com, October 23, 2001). \u201cGore: \u2018Entire north polar ice cap will be gone in 5 years\u2019\u201d (WUWT, December 14, 2008).\n\n\u201cJust 96 months to save world from catastrophe, says Prince Charles\u201d (The Independent, July 9, 2009). \u201cGordon Brown: We have fewer than fifty days to save our planet from catastrophe\u201d (The Independent, October 20, 2009). \u201cFrench Foreign Minister: \u2018500 Days to Avoid Climate Chaos\u2019\u201d (Washington Examiner, May 14, 2014). \u201cPlanet Still Standing 500 Days After French Foreign Minister Warned of \u2018Climate Chaos\u2019\u201d (Washington Examiner, September 29, 2015).\n\nIt is tragically ironic that the CEI paper came out one day before many school children were encouraged to stop studying math and science and take a day off to protest the lack of some unspecified action on global warming. Undoubtedly, the Chinese leadership was duly impressed.\n\nWhen I was in school, the concern was all about global cooling and the coming ice age, and I recall perhaps America\u2019s best-known scientist at the time, Carl Sagan, showing a TV video clip of New York City under two miles of ice. If you are old enough, you may remember the great acid rain scare where all the fish were going to die in fresh-water lakes because of power plant pollution. In case you were wondering, it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nA few decades ago, the \u201cexperts\u201d at the U.N. told us that by 2000 some island nations (e.g. The Maldives) would disappear because of rising sea levels. It turns out that the ocean seems to be rising no faster (to the extent that it can be reliably measured) than it has been doing for many decades. A recent survey of many of the low-lying islands found that very few had gotten smaller while many others had grown larger \u2014 surprise, surprise. One explanation is that coral (which lives a few feet underwater and supports many of these islands) rises and falls with sea levels, so there is something close to a steady state rather than disaster.\n\nIf you have been to New York City in recent years, you may have noticed that the West Side Highway is still comfortably above the Hudson River water level. I am writing this article in Miami in a building directly across from the Miami City Hall, which is in the old (built in the 1930s) Pan American Seaplane Terminal. It is an interesting art deco building at the water\u2019s edge on Biscayne Bay. After observing this for many years, I note that the Bay seems to be getting no closer to the building proper, and the city commissioners seem perfectly happy with the facility. Yes, the sea is rising, but at such a slow rate that it is relatively easy to adapt to it, and I would be willing to bet that the terminal building (now being a historic property) will be around far longer than most of those reading this column.\n\nWe are also told by some scientists and most everyone who is currently running for president that, if we do not act in X number of years (with each having a different number for X), it will be too late \u2014 whatever that means. As with the disappearance of the Arctic Sea Ice, these predictions have been made by many over the last few decades, and the specific X years have come, and gone, and no one noticed. Al Gore, who, after decades of telling us that the Sea Ice would be gone and that it was \u201ctoo late,\u201d had a big article in this past Sunday\u2019s New York Times with the title, \u201cIt\u2019s Not Too Late.\u201d Al, I am confused. What am I supposed to believe? The Sea Ice is still with us, and polar bear populations are increasing. And now, you tell us that it is not too late.\n\n\u2022 Richard W.
