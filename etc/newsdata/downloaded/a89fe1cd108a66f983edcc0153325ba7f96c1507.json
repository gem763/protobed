We had no money in the budget for that whatsoever, so we made this sponsorship deal where a weed company is referenced in the movie, so they [gave] us money that we were going to use for Snoop Dogg\u2019s private jet.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith, Snoop and his people stopped replying to being a part of the film, which meant that Smith had the jet on standby. Affleck, a longtime collaborator with Smith, told Smith that he was happy to be a part of the film, but he didn\u2019t want to fly commercial to location \u2014 but luckily for him, preparation for Snoop\u2019s accommodations worked just as well for him.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Can you get a jet?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018This movie\u2019s not big at all, but oddly enough you\u2019ve asked a question at the exact right time. I could get you a jet here,'\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd I explained [to him] that, \u2018We had a jet standing by for Snoop, and now we don\u2019t know where he is, but if you need a ride, I could get you down to New Orleans.\u2019 So Ben flew to New Orleans to shoot that eight page Chasing Amy sequel that takes place right in the middle of that movie.\u201d\n\nIn this case, it appears that even though Snoop didn\u2019t end up being in the Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, he\u2019s still the film\u2019s fairy Doggfather.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "description": "In a series of fortunate events, Ben Affleck made a cameo in the highly anticipated 'Jay and Silent Bob Reboot' because of Snoop Dogg.", "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-affleck-snoop-dogg-jay-and-silent-bob-reboot.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
