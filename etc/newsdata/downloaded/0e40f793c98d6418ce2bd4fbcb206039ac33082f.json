Max Rose Max RoseNY Rep. Max Rose backs impeachment inquiry Parkland survivor Lauren Hogg implores Congress to do more on school shootings Here are the House Democrats who aren't backing Trump impeachment inquiry MORE (D-N.Y.), who heads the House Homeland Security Committee\u2019s counterterrorism panel, said in a statement to The Hill. Rose has been spearheading the efforts to look into how Congress can help tech platforms crack down on the scourge of violent and bigoted communities online.\n\n\u201cBecause it feels like a game of whack-a-mole with extremist content pushed to other platforms like Telegram, it just means we have to redouble our efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nTelegram is favored among extremists because it consists of public channels where users can post relatively unfiltered content, as well as a private encrypted messaging service where people can communicate without fear of surveillance. For years, Telegram was known as the go-to app for al Qaeda and ISIS terrorists, attracting those pushed off of mainstream platforms like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNow, as mainstream platforms are putting more resources into removing neo-Nazi and white supremacist content, far-right users are also turning to Telegram.\n\n\u201cTelegram was known as a place to access Islamist extremist content, and frankly it still is,\u201d Oren Segal, the head of the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) Center on Extremism, told The Hill. \u201cBut white supremacists have been catching up to their Islamist extremist counterparts on all platforms over the past several years.\u201d\n\nSegal said the ADL has seen an \u201cincreasing amount of white supremacist activity on Telegram\u201d over the last six months, a sentiment echoed by experts at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\n\nIn March, the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand \u2014 which was livestreamed on Facebook and went viral across all top social media platforms \u2014 raised questions around how social media platforms deal with incitements to violence. The suspect, who allegedly killed more than 50 worshippers and injured dozens more, posted a white supremacist manifesto on 8chan before the attack.\n\nThe suspected shooter in El Paso also allegedly posted an anti-immigrant screed on 8chan before opening fire at a Walmart near the U.S.-Mexico border, leading several web infrastructure companies to cut ties with 8chan. Though 8chan\u2019s administrators in recent days have teased the possibility that the website will return, rebranded as \u201c8kun,\u201d it\u2019s unlikely it will ever come back with the same strength.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201c8chan was incredibly anonymous and a free-for-all,\u201d Keegan Hankes, a research director with the SPLC, told The Hill. \u201cWhat it ends up meaning is that the communities atomize, they spread out.\u201d\n\nThere are strong indications \u2014 including from users themselves \u2014 that they\u2019re migrating to other, lesser-known \u201cchan\u201d boards, similar free-for-all image-based platforms with little content moderation.\n\n\u201cHelp im a casual were did the 8ch ppl go,\u201d a user posted in late September, attracting a handful of mocking comments. And there are numerous threads where users have conferred over which fringe \u201cchans\u201d to flock to next.\n\nIn most instances, 8chan users were not left completely without a home \u2014 when a person has a social media presence on one website, they\u2019re likely to maintain others simultaneously, experts said.\n\n\u201cThere was no \u2018migration\u2019 per se, as I was already using other social media platforms in conjunction with 8chan,\u201d one user with more than 100,000 Twitter followers told The Hill in a direct message.\n\nTelegram is also raising concerns over what happens when far-right communities pull back into encrypted and secretive messaging platforms, a shift that\u2019s happening as the white extremist groups are \u201cgetting more paranoid, smaller, [and] harder to infiltrate,\u201d Hankes told The Hill.\n\nSen.

An official with the company in March 2017 penned a confrontational blog post titled \u201cDon\u2019t Shoot the Messenger\u201d defending encryption.\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee is currently working up legislation that would create a commission to craft recommendations for social media companies to limit terrorist and violent extremist content, a proposal that has already drawn scrutiny over First Amendment concerns.\n\nDemocrats pulled the bill at the last-minute before the committee was set to mark it up in September, with a committee spokesperson telling The Hill last week that it was \u201cnot ready.\u201d\n\nThe committee is hoping to mark it up this month, the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cThe movement of people from one site to another is representative of the vexing nature of online extremism,\u201d said Rep.
