Two other fires are moving across the center of the state.\n\nPacific Gas & Electric said it has discovered a problem with a transmission tower in Sonoma - but that it was too early to say if it was the cause of the blaze. The company had cut power in anticipation of high winds, but left live sections of high-voltage transmission lines, which were blamed for a series of deadly blazes that tore through the same area two years ago, killing 44 people.\n\nThis morning, as fire crew battled to contain the fires, it was revealed that six homes had burned down in Los Angeles and 49 buildings had been ravaged by the flames near the wine country town of Geyserville in northern California.\n\nA firefighter prepares to fight a wildfire as it overtakes a home Thursday in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles.

But the season kicked into higher gear Thursday with the arrival of the new raging fires on the back of 70mph gusts.\n\nThe Los Angeles canyon communities are facing two fires, including the Tick fire, named after Tick Canyon Road where the fire started north of the state's largest city, forcing the evacuations.\n\nThe fires swept through dry brush to the edge of communities in the Santa Clarita area on Thursday, and the Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said there is currently no containment of either blaze.\n\nThe flames are fed by dry winds that are predicted to strengthen across the region.\n\nNo injuries were immediately reported.\n\nWith the continued threat, the Los Angeles Unified School District announced its campuses in the San Fernando Valley would be closed Friday due to smoke and fire concerns, reports the Los Angeles Times.\n\nCommunity, Roscomare, Topanga, Valley View, Wonderland and Elementary schools will also be closed, the district announced.\n\nAlejandro Corrales tearfully watched her home burn on a ridge in Canyon Country, taking with it her mother's ashes, other belongings and possibly a pen full of pet sheep.\n\n'You start thinking about all the things you can't get back,' she told KCBS-TV.\n\nHer daughter managed to take some small pets.\n\n'Everything in the house is gone,' Corrales said. 'The panels on one of the pens where we have some rescued sheep was too hot for my daughter to open and so she couldn't let them out ... so I'm probably sure that we lost them, too.'\n\nHer three children were safe.\n\n'I'm just a little overwhelmed and I'm literally seeing sticks and fire of what used to be our home,' she said.\n\nA burning structure on Thursday collapses during the Kincade fire in Geyserville, which is part of the state's wine country\n\nA fire truck drives by a burning hillside as the Kincade Fire burns a hillside in Geyserville.

Embers were seen blowing in the wind at the bottom of a tree trunk\n\nCEO Bill Johnson said the tower is 43-years-old, which isn't uncommon in the industry, and had been inspected four times in the last two years. He said the tower appears to have been in 'excellent condition.'\n\nPG&E cut power to distribution lines in the area, but not transmission lines because the wind speed didn't call for it.\n\nAuthorities initially ordered 2,000 people to evacuate the state's popular wine country as a wildfire exploded to more than 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), whipped up by strong winds that prompted utilities statewide to impose blackouts to prevent such fires from igniting.\n\nOfficials ordered an evacuation of the entire community of Geyserville, home to about 900 people and a popular stop for wine country tourists, along with nearby residents. The blaze threatened some of the area's famed wineries and the River Rock Casino as the blaze raged on the outskirts of town.\n\nWhile battling the blaze, a firefighter came across a fire whirl that was whipping across the dry brush\n\nThis photo shows flames approaching rolling hills of grape vines in Sonoma County, which is the heart of California's world famous wine country\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, says the blaze near Geyserville had grown to 10,000 acres\n\nIn Southern California, a wall of flame rolled along the parched foothills north of Los Angeles, where thousands of homes have sprung up in recent decades.\n\nOfficials told people to flee along a mileslong stretch of Santa Clarita, where the fire quickly consumed more than a square mile (2.5 square kilometers) of dry brush and threatened homes. Winds gusting to about 40 mph (65 kph) pushed the blaze as enormous plumes of smoke visible for miles covered neighborhoods.\n\nA second fire broke out about 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, racing up a hillside to the edge of a neighborhood in Castaic and burning at least two houses.

Thank God I'm alive,' she wrote. Jackson, who founded a climate change conference, said such fires are why she is doing the work.\n\nAnother Geyserville evacuee, Isaac Hale, said he woke up to the sound of authorities ordering him out.\n\n'The highway patrol showed up banging on the door, ordering everyone to evacuate because the fire was so close,' Hale said, seated on top of his SUV near a road closure checkpoint.

Some people were refusing to leave despite the danger, Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said.\n\n'Please heed our evacuation order,' he said in a televised news conference. 'We really need to be able to fight the fire, rather than worrying about rescuing you.\n\n'This is an emotional time for many people. It's only been two years since the fires that devastated our community. For many this will be a very stressful and anxious time.'\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) says winds around the highest areas of Sonoma County had reached speeds up to 70mph, and elsewhere in the region between 30mph and 50mph.\n\nAccording to dispatch reports, the Kincade fire spread to about 1,000 acres by 11pm Wednesday night.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Cal Fire, the state firefighting agency, said the blaze near Geyserville had grown to 10,000 acres and had no containment. All residents of Geyserville were ordered to evacuate. Geyserville has about 900 residents and is a popular stop for wine country tourists.\n\nThe fire raged amid rolling blackouts instituted after utility electrical equipment was blamed for setting several blazes in recent years that killed scores of people and burned thousands of homes.\n\nPG&E spokesman Paul Doherty said parts of Geyserville lost power as scheduled Wednesday. The company's outages are affecting half a million people or nearly 180,000 customers.\n\nThis graphic shows the evacuation area where the Kincade fire is currently spreading in California\n\nCal Fire Captain Whitney Wong works the fire line to fight the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County near Geyserville Thursday\n\nIn Southern California, hot and dry Santa Ana winds led Southern California Edison to cut power to more than 27,000 customers.

'But we also understand the heartbreak and devastation caused by catastrophic wildfires.'\n\nThe utilities company said the precautionary blackouts are designed to keep winds that could gust to 60mph or more from knocking branches into power lines or toppling them, sparking wildfires.\n\nThe latest outage comes two weeks after PG&E shut down the power for several days to about 2 million people in northern and central California.\n\nThe current outages were to last about 48 hours, the utility company said. But its seven-day forecast shows a likelihood of another planned blackout across a much larger area.\n\nThe timing wasn't clear but it could start as early as Saturday, when even heavier winds are expected to move through parts of California.\n\n'This could be the strongest wind event of the season, unfortunately,' PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said.\n\nStrenfel called the current wind event a 'California-wide phenomenon'.\n\nIn the south, where hot, dry Santa Ana winds hit Thursday, officials said flames are no longer visible, but mandatory and voluntary evacuations remain in place as the winds gust through the region and create extreme fire risk.\n\nThe Forest Service says 80 homes are under evacuation in the city and a Red Cross shelter has opened at a high school.\n\nSouthern California Edison warned that it might black out about 308,000 customers - perhaps 750,000 people - depending on the forecast.\n\nSan Diego Gas & Electric warned of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nA home burns at a vineyard during the Kincade fire near Geyserville on Thursday\n\nA home burns during the Kincade fire near Geyserville on Thursday as the fast-moving wildfire roared through California wine country\n\nA firefighter hoses a hot spot while battling the Kincade fire in Geyserville on Thursday\n\nA burned car sits next to a swing after the Kincade Fire moved through Geyersville on Thursday\n\nThe cause of the Kincade fire is under investigation.
