Trump has defied a decades-old tradition of presidents voluntarily releasing their returns.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has refused to turn over the filings, saying Democrats do not have a legitimate legislative reason for seeking the documents. The administration says Democrats merely want to search Trump\u2019s records for potentially embarrassing information.\n\nNeal, however, argues that he needs the documents to examine how thoroughly the IRS audits presidents and vice presidents, which is routine after they are elected.\n\nA district court in Washington has scheduled a Nov. 6 hearing on a bid by Trump\u2019s lawyers to have the case dismissed.\n\nThe Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNeal asked Delmar for the probe earlier this week.\n\n\u201cI want to be assured that Treasury, including the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), is enforcing the law in a fair and impartial manner and no one is endeavoring to intimidate or impede government officials and employees carrying out their duties,\u201d Neal said in a letter to Delmar.\n\nNeal asked Delmar to identify everyone within Treasury and the IRS, and anyone outside the agencies, who was \u201cinvolved in the handling of my requests and all related decisions.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fc/06/95a443fa4a66ba2f9fdb7d5e0f49/190930-treasury-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
