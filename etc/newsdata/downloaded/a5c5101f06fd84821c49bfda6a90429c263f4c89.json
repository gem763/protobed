It considers the YPG and its political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), as indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) \u2014 a militant group seeking greater autonomy for Turkey's Kurdish region that is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nAnkara also plans to establish a \"safe zone\" in the areas it takes from the YPG in order to resettle Syrian refugees there. Turkey currently hosts 3.5 million refugees, according to official figures.\n\nThe Turkish incursion and safe zone plans have triggered concerns over potential large-scale displacement of Syrian Kurds, who are warning of \"ethnic cleansing.\"\n\nAnkara's move comes two days after Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw its troops from the area, a policy shift that many interpreted as tacit approval of the planned incursion.\n\nTrump also said that Turkey would take custody of the thousands of Islamic State fighters currently held by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) \u2014 a U.S.-backed militia alliance dominated by the YPG \u2014 but did not offer details on how such a handover would work.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali accused Turkey of targeting civilians with airstrikes shortly after the launch of the incursion. \"There is a huge panic among people of the region,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker called on Turkey to show restraint, adding: \u201cIf the plan involves the creation of a so-called safe zone, don\u2019t expect the EU to pay for any of it.\u201d\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called on Turkey to break off the operation, warning that it risks \"a reinvigoration\" of the Islamic State and \"a humanitarian disaster as well as new refugee flows.\" France's European Affairs Minister Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, meanwhile, said France and the U.K. would call a U.N. Security Council over Turkey's incursion.\n\nJens Stoltenberg, secretary-general of NATO \u2014 of which Turkey is a member \u2014 said: \"I count on Turkey to ... ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised,\" adding that he would discuss the matter with Erdo\u011fan on Friday.\n\nThis article has been updated.", "description": "The operation is aimed at driving Syrian Kurdish forces away from the Turkish border.", "authors": ["Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179972395.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
