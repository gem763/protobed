Based on the first act of \u201cOctober Surprise\u201d \u2014 written by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, and directed by Janet Mock \u2014 that doesn\u2019t seem to be a worry for him. Prior to his four deep breaths outside Harvard\u2019s admissions offices, Payton\u2019s concerns with getting into Harvard seemed to be twofold: He wanted in on his own merits because he didn\u2019t ever want it to get out that he bought his way into college, and he wanted in on his own merits because he wanted it to be real. Either he was lying about that second one \u2014 to others and possibly himself \u2014 or that\u2019s changed.\n\n\u201cOctober Surprise\u201d turns on that change, if that\u2019s what it is. Payton no longer sees the distinction, or has chosen to ignore that distinction. He\u2019s not winning the election, but he\u2019s positioned to, and he does not seem interested in solidifying that position \u201con his merits.\u201d In flashback, River says he doesn\u2019t think he could make an argument for something he doesn\u2019t believe in, and Payton replies, without hesitation, \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a better person than I am.\u201d But River believes otherwise. The kiwi they serve in the cafeteria now is evidence. Who cares if it was politically motivated? It\u2019s got four times as much vitamin C as an orange.\n\nIt seems clear that Payton, deep down, does not believe he\u2019s a good person. (This suddenly feels like a recap of The Good Place.) And while sliced kiwi and River\u2019s Law might be good ideas, he\u2019s got no problem doing some underhanded shit, too. That\u2019s bad news for Astrid and Skye, the former flummoxed and the latter furious, whose report on the polling numbers\u2014\n\nActually, let\u2019s stop there for a moment. Let\u2019s talk about polling.\n\nObviously, The Politician is not a work of realism. So of course these kids have access to polling data. What I don\u2019t understand is how the actual students in this school \u2014 and not just Pierre \u2014 fit in. They\u2019re all willing to participate in the polling? I don\u2019t expect them to react in a realistic way, I just don\u2019t see them reacting at all. There seemed to be a lot of animosity toward Payton, and then sympathy, and now it\u2019s as if the only students in this whole school are Team Payton, Team Astrid, Pierre, and Andrew. That\u2019s it. We see crowds, but they always feel like props. Are they engaged in this election? Both the polling and the crowd at Payton\u2019s assembly (more on that later) would indicate that they are, but it just feels so \u2026 quiet. Is this a storm affecting only a few? Or does the student body, as a whole, care? If this were a chill election, that would be one thing, but guinea worms and then everyone goes back to class? Tell me about the students, Ryan/Brad/Ian.\n\nBack to it. Payton\u2019s eroding (or unmasked) ruthless side keeps rearing its head, and it\u2019s bad news for Astrid and Skye, who are reacting very differently. (More Skye please! Rahne Jones is great.) The latter\u2019s powerful frustration seems reasonable \u2014 it amounts to \u201cwhat is your problem, this is a big moment for me and people who look like me, do something for the love of god you rich asshole\u201d \u2014 and then, in a moment that sort of sums up The Politician at the moment, she pivots to assassination. It all makes sense, and then Whoa, where did that come from? But her advice clearly spurs Astrid to do something, or at least allow something to happen. I can\u2019t say which, because Astrid isn\u2019t a character yet. A lot of these characters are underdeveloped, but given the importance of her role, it\u2019s her flimsiness that\u2019s the most egregious.\n\nAlice, though, comes in for a close second. I\u2019m not sure what to make of the James/Alice connection, mostly because, at this stage at least, it doesn\u2019t seem to affect the plot or the characters in any way. It\u2019s not the thing that brings Alice back into the fold. It does prompt Alice and Payton to tell the truth about some things, but other than the latter\u2019s confession about River, it\u2019s all just information, not really anything it hurts or helps to reveal. And while for a moment it seems as though James\u2019s anger leads him to conspire about Payton, that, too is a ruse. Why even include that detail?\n\nAll of this \u2014 the flashback, Payton\u2019s admissions gambit, Andrew and Ricardo, the polling, Alice and James, the guinea worm thing, a truly bizarre scene involving a potential \u201clove\u201d tape and some VHS footage of a trip to Busch Gardens, Astrid playing a couple rounds of tennis-plus-emotional-abuse with her dad Dylan McDermott, Georgiana slipping one of the faux-Winklevii a fat envelope of cash because being poor sucks, and Payton\u2019s assembly \u2014 happens in the first 30 minutes of this 40-minute episode. It is a lot. And then another 10 minutes take place, and it\u2019s like another episode crawled inside this one and fused onto the end.\n\nTo be clear, Ricardo\u2019s first visit to Astrid, the scene at the diner, the terrific scene at Infinity\u2019s (Can it, Nana!), the video hitting the internet, and the breakup take place in one night; the reconciliation, Ricardo\u2019s home invasion and potential assault, and January Jones using that muscle memory to remember how it felt when Betty Draper would come home wasted from a party all happen the next day/evening. It would be a big ending on an episode with half this much plot. And some of it works \u2014 just not all of it.\n\nThat aforementioned flimsiness when it comes to Astrid and Alice in particular might be the biggest issue. But the tonal whiplash isn\u2019t insignificant. When the show gets that balance right, it can be magnificent. It is here, in flashes. But when it\u2019s off, it simply highlights the other flaws. At least it\u2019s never boring.\n\nTalking Points\n\n\u2022 Janet Mock\u2019s direction is terrific (as it always is on Pose). It\u2019s also a lot fewer consciously mannered/Wes Anderson-esque elements than previous episodes, with a style of its own. That cut from the flashback to Payton breathing in the car. The shot of him walking down that gorgeous, colorful hallway in Alice\u2019s house, bringing her that skinny drink. The home invasion. The light framing Payton in that Harvard office. Just terrific. I hope she\u2019s highly in demand as a director now.\n\n\u2022 Take the happy sighing noise David Corenswet makes when Payton tells River \u201cYou\u2019re a better person than I am,\u201d bottle it, make millions.\n\n\u2022 Platt\u2019s \u201cCan it, Nana!\u201d joins \u201cWHY did you DROP out of YALE\u201d from Gilmore Girls in my line-reading hall of fame.\n\n\u2022 Costume of the episode: Astrid\u2019s Moonrise Kingdom drag during the guinea worm incident.\n\n\u2022 Zoey Deutch is great here, she makes that breakup hurt.", "description": "Payton\u2019s ruthless side keeps rearing its head, and it\u2019s bad news for Astrid and Skye.
