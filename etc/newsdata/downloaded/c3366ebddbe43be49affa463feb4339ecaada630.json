The opening was supported by another local artist, Tracey Emin, who grew up in the Kent seaside resort: spot her neon installation on the adjacent Droit House, a former customs building that\u2019s now home to the tourist office. Inside the gallery, expect an eclectic rolling programme of exhibitions and events, and sea views that Turner fans will recognise from the artist\u2019s work. Open daily, 10am-6pm, free entry.\n\nFeeling inspired? The Turner tour guide, available from the gallery\u2019s website, invites readers to visit locations in Margate and beyond that have been immortalised by Turner.\n\nStep inside a seaside grotto\n\nThe mysterious origins of Margate\u2019s subterranean shell grotto, which was discovered in 1835 (smuggler\u2019s cave or rich man\u2019s passion project?) only add to its magical appeal. Wander through a winding passageway covered with an ornate mosaic of about 4.5 million shells. Open daily, 10am-5pm until 28 October, then open for winter hours, 11am-4pm, Friday to Sunday; \u00a34 entry.\n\nGet on your bike\n\nHire a stylish blue Pashley bike from Ride... in the train station and cycle along the Viking Coastal Trail to Botany Bay, a quiet beach flanked by chalky cliffs and seaweed-strewn rock pools. The route promises a leisurely ride along traffic-free promenades overlooking the coast. Open Monday to Saturday, 9am-5pm; Sundays 9am-4pm. Prices from \u00a35 for one hour.\n\nThe fun of the fair\n\nOnce Margate\u2019s star attraction, Dreamland amusement park fell into disrepair before being reopened in 2015. As well as a candy-striped helter-skelter, Ferris wheel and the original 1920s Scenic Railway roller coaster (the oldest in the UK), there\u2019s street food stalls and a roller disco. Look out for film screenings, gigs, circus performers and pop-up crazy golf courses as part of the packed-out events calendar, too. Park open daily 10am-6pm, hours for specific attractions may vary. Admission \u00a35, ride prices vary.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nBook ahead at The Reading Rooms, a Grade II-listed Georgian townhouse that\u2019s home to Margate\u2019s loveliest boutique B&B. It\u2019s like stepping inside a Pinterest board, with three vast rooms containing roll-top baths, vintage chandeliers, huge, comfy beds and distressed paintwork. Breakfast, served at tables in your room, is a grand affair: thick slabs of sourdough toast and jam, golden-yolked eggs, and cold-pressed juices, made with local ingredients. Doubles from \u00a3160, B&B.\n\nSands hotel is a grand, light-filled building on the seafront with plush rooms, many of which boast sea views or balconies from which to watch the sunset. The cream and blue-coloured dining room is decked out with leather banquettes and French windows, while the terrace is a fitting spot for pre-dinner cocktails. Doubles from \u00a3120, B&B.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThe food scene is flourishing in Margate. Choose from local seafood reimagined through a Scandi-cool lens at Hantverk & Found, or modern, pared-back small plates at Angela\u2019s, where the menu changes based on the day\u2019s catch.\n\nFor something more traditional, Buoy and Oyster is a family-run restaurant overlooking the beach. Expect a warm welcome, and exactly the sort of food you\u2019ll be in the mood for after a day breathing in the salty sea air: Broadstairs crab with bread, butter and lemon-spiked mayonnaise; oysters dressed with pickled cucumber and dill; zingy seared tuna and crisp-skinned halibut in a deep, ochre-hued saffron crab bisque.\n\nCome lunchtime, while queues still form daily outside the excellent Peter\u2019s Fish Factory chippy, for something a little less traditional, wander down the harbour wall to Scandinavian coffee shop Mala Kaffe for open rye sandwiches, cardamom buns and great coffee. A few doors down, Cheesy Tiger (Unit seven and eight, Harbour Arm) is a fromage fiend\u2019s dream, serving oozy toasties, raclette and truffle mac \u2019n\u2019 cheese.\n\nThe Sun Deck is home to a blossoming street food community, from Creole-style sandwiches at Po\u2019Boys, to hangover-busting breakfasts served in a vintage double-decker at The Bus Caf\u00e9.\n\nAnd for the best ice cream in town, head to Melt Gelato to sample the ever-changing array of ices, plus milkshakes and waffles.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nAfter a day by the sea, The Lifeboat is a cosy pub in which to recharge. The beers come courtesy of BrewDog, so expect the brewery\u2019s range on tap, plus local Kentish ales and craft beer from around the world.\n\nBottleshop is a bar in the Old Town with a boggling selection of craft beer, cocktails with house-made syrups, and hand-mixed gin and tonic on tap. You can bring your own food, so pick up a pizza topped with local crab and British charcuterie from GB Pizza next door to eat at one of the outdoor tables overlooking the harbour.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nVintage junkies can seek out hidden treasures among the Old Town\u2019s cobbled streets: browse for Sixties dresses at Madam Popoff; carefully curated utilitarian womenswear at Werkhaus; and Teddy-boy suits at Breuer and Dawson.\n\nNorthdown Road, in the suburb of Cliftonville, is home to a fleet of boutique shops. Mar Mar is a caf\u00e9 and shop filled with succulents and design-led homewares, while Urchin Wines combines a natural wine shop and deli with a gallery space. Transmission Records sells rare vinyl, and next door, Cliffs is the epitome of Margate\u2019s new hipster image, comprising a coffee roastery, record shop, salon, yoga studio and caf\u00e9.\n\nFinally, take a bit of the sea home with you in the form of the gorgeous products at Haeckels, which sells soaps, fragrances and candles made using local sea buckthorn and bladderwrack.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nDavid Chipperfield designed Turner Contemporary and its angular form looks impressive jutting out against the coast, contrasting with the rows of Victorian houses along the seafront: a proud emblem of the changing face of Margate.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nHow do I get there?\n\nSingle fares from London St Pancras on Southeastern Railway start from \u00a313.80, and the journey time is around 90 minutes.\n\nPublic transport\n\nMargate is small enough to explore on foot. If you want to visit the nearby seaside towns of Broadstairs and Ramsgate, The Loop is a frequent Stagecoach bus service which \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 travels in a loop between the three.\n\nBest view\n\nAmble past the Turner Contemporary and along the harbour wall to the lighthouse. In one direction, you\u2019ll look out to the quiet sea; in the other, back to the hustle and bustle of Margate seafront, with its pastel-coloured rows of houses.\n\nInsider tip\n\nBrace yourself for a dip in Walpole Bay tidal pool, a short walk along the coast from Margate in Cliftonville. The Grade II-listed pool was opened in 1937, and stretches out over four acres, making it the UK\u2019s largest seawater lido.", "description": "Once a down-at-heel seaside town, an influx of creatives flocking to Margate in recent years to escape London\u2019s rising living costs \u2013 and breathe in a little sea air \u2013 have seen it transformed into Kent\u2019s capital of cool.
