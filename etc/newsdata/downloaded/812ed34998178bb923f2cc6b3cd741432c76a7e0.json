As training camps get underway Trysta Krick digests, debriefs and explains all the crazy moves made with a map. Take notes and get ready. USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors plan to rest most of their star players for Monday's exhibition at Staples Center.\n\nThe Lakers have ruled out LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Kyle Kuzma, while the Warriors plan to sit Draymond Green and D'Angelo Russell. The Warriors will still play Stephen Curry, but he will rest on Wednesday in another exhibition against the Lakers at Staples Center.\n\nBoth teams are handling their stars with care during preseason play, which includes three games this week in Los Angeles (Monday, Wednesday) and San Francisco (Friday). The Lakers have other reasons, too. They are only two days removed from a week-long trip in China and landed in Los Angeles late on Saturday. The Lakers are also nursing injuries to Davis (right thumb) and Kuzma (left foot).\n\nPublished reports indicate that Davis' MRI came out clean, but the Lakers have not released any information. The Lakers also plan to have a medical update on Kuzma, who has missed all of training camp after nursing a stress reaction in his left foot while training this summer with Team USA before the FIBA World Cup.\n\nIt is not surprising for teams to rest their star players during exhibition play. It is unusual for an NBA team to play a game merely two days after a preseason trip in China, which coincided with league-wide controversy surrounding Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeting out support for the Hong Kong protesters. The Warriors had a week-long preseason trip in China two years ago, and did not play again until five days later.\n\n\"It felt like it took a full week to recover from the jet lag,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"I do not envy the Lakers and their travel schedule right now.\"\n\nDavis injured his right thumb early in Saturday's exhibition against the Nets in Shenzhen. The Lakers originally planned to evaluate Davis on Sunday, but they pushed the MRI to Monday to account for a delayed flight returning to Los Angeles.\n\nThe injury-riddled Warriors also have absences to Klay Thompson (left knee), Kevon Looney (right hamstring), Alec Burks (right ankle), Willie Cauley-Stein (left foot) and Alen Smailagic (right ankle).\n\nFollow Mark Medina on Twitter @MarkG_Medina.", "description": "While the Lakers wait for an update on Anthony Davis' thumb, LeBron James and Draymond Green will join him in sitting out the Lakers-Warriors game.", "authors": ["Mark Medina", "Published P.M.
