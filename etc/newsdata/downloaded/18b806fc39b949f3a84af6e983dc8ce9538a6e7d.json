His former NBC colleagues called the allegation \"painful.\" USA TODAY\n\nFormer NBC News employee Brooke Nevils reported to NBC in 2017 that Matt Lauer raped her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to new details published in a forthcoming book by Ronan Farrow. (Nevils, who had previously been anonymous, filed a complaint that led to Lauer's firing from the \"Today\" show nearly two years ago, though the public only knew then that he had been terminated over \"inappropriate sexual behavior.\") Lauer, on Wednesday, denied the rape accusation as \"categorically false.\"\n\nThat Nevils waited years to report the alleged incident and go public is unsurprising, sexual violence experts say.\n\nOnly about one in four survivors report being abused and, of those who do, delayed reporting is \u201cdefinitely the norm,\u201d said Scott Berkowitz, founder and president of RAINN, the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization.\n\nRape is the most under-reported crime: 63% of sexual assaults are not reported to police, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. Perpetrators of sexual violence are less likely to go to jail or prison than other criminals, according to RAINN.\n\n\u201cNo matter how old you are or what the context is, it can be incredibly difficult to make a report of sexual assault,\u201d said Emily Martin, the vice president for Education and Workplace Justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nGoing public: Why it took Ashley Wagner a decade to talk about her sexual assault\n\nHelplessness, terror and shame\n\nThe reasons for not disclosing are myriad, ranging from the fear of not being believed to not wanting to have to relive the assault to not wanting the assault to become their identity. There is also the fear of retaliation if the abuser is in a position of power.\n\nWhen someone is physically attacked or experiences other kinds of trauma, they may feel helplessness, terror and other extreme, negative emotions. However, it's likely they will be able to get support from others and unlikely they'll need to keep it a secret. But when the trauma is sexual, it violates the most intimate parts of a person's body and psyche. Added to the feeling of helplessness is humiliation with a long and strong cultural history, creating a complex, potent cocktail of shame.\n\nBeverly Engel, a psychotherapist who\u2019s worked with sexual assault victims for almost 40 years, notes that not reporting an assault is more common than reporting it \u2013 and shame is a big reason why.\n\n\"People who are full of shame don\u2019t have the self-confidence to report,\" she said. \"They have a very strong belief it was their fault already and then they have a belief they\u2019re going to be blamed.\"\n\nNot everyone can discuss being attacked in this way because victims have often been told it is their doing. I\u2019m glad you recognize it is not your fault and having the bravery to stand up and say it to the world. It\u2019ll help others recognize they were not at fault and seek help. \u2014 K\u00e5-L\u00e5\u00ef W\u00f0\u00f1g \u9ec3\u5609\u9e97 (@KaLaiWong) October 10, 2019\n\nHarassed or assaulted at work: Here's what steps you can take\n\nJune Tangney, a clinical psychology professor at George Mason University, agrees that reporting, even outside of law enforcement, can seem like \"a no-win situation.\"\n\n\"It feels like such a terrible, terrible risk to tell someone, because a lot of bad things could happen. There's the feeling that they will now see you as spoiled or dirty or damaged in some way,\" Tangney said. \"Are they going to see me as a different person? Are they going to believe me? Being invalidated in that way is very harmful.\"\n\nPeople have a hard time believing 'good guys' rape\n\nSexual predators don\u2019t have a scarlet S on their foreheads. They don\u2019t dress in trench coats. Most, in fact, appear to be nice, normal people \u2013 making it that much harder for anyone to believe they\u2019re capable of such heinous acts.\n\nAnalysis: George H.W. Bush and the problem with thinking 'good guys' don't cross the line\n\n\u201cPeople who carry out sexual assault are skilled at manipulation, not just the victim but people around them. Appearing kind and friendly,\u201d said Kristen Houser of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape.\n\nBefore his firing, Lauer had become one of the most recognizable faces in morning television. But as Variety reported in 2017, \"work and sex were intertwined\" for Lauer, who developed a pattern of inviting women late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics over the years, and to his secluded office within 30 Rockefeller Center.\n\nMatt Lauer in the Rosa Khutor Mountain Village ahead of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics on Feb. 6, 2014 in Sochi, Russia. (Photo: Scott Halleran/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great at presenting a public persona much of the time that does not add up to what we think someone capable of sexual assault looks like,\" Houser said.\n\nFor their victims, yet another reason for silence.\n\n\u201cThe victim is often left really confused because they\u2019ve now seen two sides of a person that don\u2019t add up,\u201d Houser said. \u201cThey\u2019re much more familiar with the manipulation side, the side that looks nice and trustworthy.\u201d\n\nI am no fan of Matt but this story makes no sense. Who would continue to have a relationship of any kind with their rapist? I don\u2019t get it. No job is worth that.. maybe I\u2019m missing something?. Just keeping it \ud83d\udcaf\u270c\ufe0f \u2014 MissB (@metzaphysicalme) October 10, 2019\n\nSo survivors often question themselves, Houser said, wondering whether the abuse really happened or if they did something to provoke it. Some will remain in contact with the abuser, even stay friends with him or her, hoping the \u201cnormalcy\u201d will protect them from a future assault.\n\n\u201cPeople often don\u2019t want someone to do time in jail. They just want them to never do that to them again,\u201d Houser said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want them to do it to someone else.\u201d\n\nCombating shame\n\nConfidants have a lot of power and responsibility to help survivors release shame, therapist David Bedrick says.\n\n\"I think when someone gets shamed by ... gas-lighting, they need the opposite. Someone who doesn\u2019t deny it. 'I believe you' is really important. 'I want to know the details,' that\u2019s really important,\" Bedrick said. \"When someone takes interest in the details not to figure out why you screwed up but because they want to know, [the victim] feels like they see them. And having a feeling response.\"\n\nThough not for everyone, speaking out about the experience upends the shame for many women.\n\n\"I want to thank the many survivors who shared their stories with me today and offered their support,\" Nevils tweeted Wednesday. \"It takes courage, and I am truly grateful.\"\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org/online and receive confidential support.\n\nContributing: Alia Dastagir.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/10/matt-lauer-accused-rape-why-brooke-nevils-waited-go-public/3929152002/", "description": "Brooke Nevils waited years to report her alleged rape by Matt Lauer, and until recently remained anonymous.
