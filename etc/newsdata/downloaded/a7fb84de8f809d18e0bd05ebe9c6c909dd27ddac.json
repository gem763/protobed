It Isn\u2019t the Surprise", "language": "en", "text": "Ryan Gosling ponders the mysterious in Blade Runner 2049 Photo: Warner Bros\n\nWhen Michael Green was hired to co-write Blade Runner 2049, the screenwriter had to give himself a crash course in a genre he knew little to nothing about: mystery. Both the 2017 Denis Villeneuve\u2013directed sequel and Ridley Scott\u2019s original 1982 Blade Runner are commonly associated with science fiction, but they\u2019re also standard bearers for neo-noir. So, ahead of penning the 2049 script, Green immersed himself in the hard-boiled crime fiction of James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler, internalizing their dramatic twists and tropes. \u201cI hadn\u2019t written something like that before,\u201d says Green, a DC Comics contributor whose first television writing credit came from Sex and the City, \u201cso I had the unique pleasure of filling in very large holes in my reading by diving into classic noir.\u201d\n\nIn delivering a contemporary companion piece to a Philip K. Dick classic, Green \u2014 alongside original Bladerunner scribe Hampton Fancher \u2014 endeavored to structure his story \u201cone concentric circle wider in terms of complexity\u201d than its predecessor. In broad strokes, his LAPD detective protagonist would still be investigating mysterious occurrences involving artificial humans called \u201creplicants,\u201d and would still be puzzling together sequences of events in which the truth is revealed in dramatic, often violent fits and spurts. But throughout the process of writing, Green was \u201chaunted\u201d by a 2009 Guardian article entitled \u201cBeyond the silver screen\u201d by writer-director Paul Schrader, in which he posits that a 24/7 multimedia universe has rendered audiences immune to, and exhausted by, narrative storytelling. The twists and tropes he\u2019d come to believe were the hallmarks of the mystery genre were seemingly impossible to pull off in such a reality.\n\n\u201cAudiences today are both eager and more capable of processing much more complex stories,\u201d Green says. \u201cYour average viewer \u2014 any viewer who approaches a mystery, be it an hour-long TV procedural or a film that\u2019s taken many people many years to concoct \u2014 they will look at it and automatically, subconsciously be able to see the decision tree of where the story can go. When viewers have conservatively consumed 20,000 hours of mystery over the course of their lives, there\u2019s a proportion of the audience that will just be able to guess certain outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the onus falls off of surprise,\u201d he concludes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is the possibility of surprise.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting stance to take, given that Green \u2014 the American Gods showrunner whose filmography includes Alien: Covenant, the X-Men spinoff Logan, and Disney\u2019s upcoming Jungle Cruise \u2014 has gone on to adapt two more mysteries for the screen since ending Blade Runner 2049 with what many critics have described as a \u201ctwist.\u201d Green wrote the screenplay for Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Murder on the Orient Express, adapted from British fiction mystery doyenne Agatha Christie\u2019s quintessential 1934 story, and re-teamed with the Irish director to helm Christie\u2019s Death on the Nile (out in 2020). Jumping from noir to whodunit, Green found it best not to try to \u201cout-Christie Christie\u201d; instead, he focused on delivering an entirely different experience based only loosely on the idea of a whodunit plot and more on \u201cpure character work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a viewer, I enjoy character studies, and as a writer, I enjoy putting three or four entertaining, potentially ingenious characters in one small room and seeing who wins. The mystery just gives them a reason to be there,\u201d Green says. \u201cPlenty of fans will disagree with me, but Christie doesn\u2019t concern herself with deep characterizations. Instead she tended to employ character shorthand. \u2018A Scotsman of 50.\u2019 \u2018A Spaniard.\u2019 That leaves tremendous opportunity! I get to come in and dimensionalize them as humans and say who these people will be and how we can broaden out their world by broadening out who might show up in her mysteries. I get to have a lot of fun just by making people younger or older or not white or from other countries.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t believe there is the possibility of surprise.\n\nThat being said, Christie\u2019s novels tend to involve hundreds of pages of exposition and, as any scriptwriter will tell you, exposition is the toughest thing to write for the screen. \u201cIn [adapting a] mystery, you inherit a certain number of data points that you have to find the ideal places to deploy \u2014 to make them interesting, to make them memorable. And you have to find ways of making the audience accept it without making them feel vegetal,\u201d Green says. \u201cIn a typical Agatha Christie book, it seems like there are 3,600 data points to support her story. The hardest job I had on Murder on the Orient Express was finding out how to incorporate what I thought were the essential data points. And then finding out in subsequent drafts and in the editing room, how wrong I was about what was actually essential. We didn\u2019t need as much as I thought.\u201d\n\nThat revelation made the writing of Death on the Nile much easier: \u201cwe could just focus on what film does better: character motivations.\u201d Surprise can still have value, Green attests, but it doesn\u2019t have to be fetishized. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly surprise everyone. The rare story can, but on balance, that\u2019s not what you\u2019re there as a screenwriter to deliver. What you\u2019re there to deliver is an enjoyable experience of watching yourself be right or wrong on your guess.\u201d\n\nBy de-emphasizing the element of surprise, Green seems to suggest that, contrary to Schrader\u2019s tolling of the narrative death knell, the tried-and-true mystery genre might actually offer keen possibilities for the future of storytelling. When asked if there are any narrative arcs that have fallen out of fashion \u2014 any tropes of suspense so hoary and clich\u00e9 that they have been effectively banished from screens in 2019, his answer is an emphatic no.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many people writing so many stories right now,\u201d the writer says. \u201cThe number of procedurals, every one of them a mystery, every one of them turning out eight to 24 episodes a year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any part of the mystery buffalo not being digested or turned into boots.\u201d", "description": "The secret to a good mystery movie isn\u2019t surprise.
