Bolton as his national security adviser, the third person to hold the job since the beginning of the Trump administration. Though the White House has said Mr. Bolton\u2019s current deputy, Charles M. Kupperman, will take over in the interim, Mr. Trump has said he will announce a successor next week.\n\nA guessing game immediately began among the president\u2019s formal and informal advisers about who still left in the president\u2019s orbit might get the job.\n\nThe expanding list of possibilities, generated by those hoping to promote their allies or harm their enemies, included Fred Fleitz, Mr. Bolton\u2019s former chief of staff; Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general and a former acting national security adviser; Jack Keane, a retired Army vice chairman currently advising the vice president on national security; Robert Blair, an adviser to Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff; and Robert C. O\u2019Brien, the administration\u2019s hostage envoy who called Mr. Trump the greatest hostage negotiator in American history.\n\nAs the administration begins to resemble a game of reverse musical chairs \u2014 too many open slots without enough loyalists to fill them \u2014 a short list of plausible replacements emerged.", "description": "President Trump is on the hunt for the fourth national security adviser of his presidency.
