The solution: a live-broadcast shooting contest at a local gun range, and may the best marksman win.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll settle their difference at the Rifle Shooting Range,\u201d read a Facebook flyer, which featured side-by-side pictures of the rifle-toting, camo-clad rivals.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nIn a country that has long prided itself on its high standards of civility and low levels of violence compared with its southern neighbor, gun rights, individualism and free speech are among the most important values to supporters of the new party. But the upshot of the episode also illustrates the differences in politics of gun ownership in Canada and the U.S.\n\nAfter rejecting suggestions to solve the matter through a beanbag toss and potato sack race, PPC candidates Mark Friesen and Guto Penteado settled on a Robin Hood-like contest of shooting skills at a gun range run by the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation. They alerted the local press about their plans to broadcast the duel live Monday on Facebook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about promotion. This is bigger than gun rights; it\u2019s about property rights and free speech,\u201d said Mr. Friesen, a tree doctor from Saskatoon.\n\nMr. Penteado, the PCC candidate in the small city\u2019s other district, grew up on a farm in Brazil and learned hunting from his father. He moved to Canada 17 years ago and fell in love with Saskatchewan\u2019s country culture. A licensed hunter and gun owner, Mr. Penteado said a shootout to decide which candidate goes to the debate would represent \u201cpromotion about the good side of guns as a sport because all we see is very bad news about mass shootings, and this is a very bad image for gun owners and the guns themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe live in the countryside, we love the nature, we love the interaction with animals and everything like that,\u201d Mr. Penteado told the national CBC news network. \u201cI\u2019m referring to the good connotations about rednecks. We\u2019re not stupid. We\u2019re good rednecks.\u201d\n\nQuestioning the \u2018message\u2019\n\nThe dueling duo\u2019s announcement of a shootout quickly attracted national attention, including coverage from Canada\u2019s biggest media outlets. Not all of the reaction was favorable.\n\nCharles Smith, an associate professor of political studies at St. Thomas More College at the University of Saskatchewan, told the CBC that the event was insensitive, especially right after another mass shooting in Texas.\n\nUsing guns to settle disputes reinforces the message that guns and violence are normal, he told the broadcaster, and \u201cthat\u2019s not a message political parties should be sending in 2019.\u201d\n\nThe candidates, however, thought the attention was fantastic. So Mr. Friesen was surprised when the provinces\u2019 political reporters who had assembled at the gun range were told Monday that there would be no gunfight at the SWF corral.\n\nMr. Friesen immediately suspected a conspiracy \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d But Robert Freberg, past president and current fundraising chairman for the local federation that owns and operates the gun range, said the problem wasn\u2019t politics but planning.\n\nThe range has a complete ban on photography to protect members\u2019 privacy, Mr. Freberg said. Also, Mr. Friesen\u2019s membership had expired and he announced his event without waiting for permission to hold it, Mr. Freberg said.\n\n\u201cWhen he phoned and told me he wanted to renew his membership, he thought that was enough,\u201d Mr. Freberg said. \u201cBut applications for membership and events go through the board. We tried to handle this in a professional manner and gave him an option to wait. He didn\u2019t do that. At the end of the day, neither man was a member, so they had to stay outside.\u201d\n\nRod Giltaca is CEO and executive director of the Canadian Coalition for Firearm Rights, Canada\u2019s largest advocacy group for firearms owners. The event may not have been completely successful as a publicity stunt but there was nothing wrong with it, he said.\n\nIn the United States, this kind of gun issue might have inflamed the national gun debate and grown into a bonfire for politicians. But in Canada, the story barely registered and even the local media didn\u2019t report the winner. Mr. Friesen said he triumphed Wednesday after they relocated to a private farm and each man took five shots with a .22 rifle at a target 75 to 100 yards away.\n\nMr. Giltaca said his organization has few parallels with the National Rifle Association. The regulatory system in Canada is \u201cvery different from the United States,\u201d and the constitution provides no right to gun ownership.\n\nAs a result, the Canadian group represents a broad-based membership, he said, and reasons for buying guns are different.\n\nAmericans buy guns for self-defense, but in Canada that is discouraged as a valid reason for a gun permit, he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
