Mitt Romney posted a couple of critical tweets suggesting that there could be no other motivation for Trump to ask for assistance looking into the Bidens and Ukraine and China than political, calling it \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won,\u201d Trump replied Saturday.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of chatter on Twitter about who\u2019s right \u2014 Romney or Trump \u2014 but Never Trumper Bill Kristol decided to start a poll asking who was more respected: Trump or Romney. Kristol called Twitter a hellscape, meaning we\u2019re pretty sure he knew which way his poll would go, and after just six hours and more than 133,662 votes, Trump is way out ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s see how much of a hellscape Twitter is. Whom do you respect more? \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 5, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s what it looks like now, but maybe Romney will have all of his children and grandchildren vote and tip the scale.\n\nJust because liberals flock to you like flies to rotting food doesn't mean they outnumber average working Americans. \u2014 Pooka Luck (@MuchLuck) October 5, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019d come out of your elitist Trump-hating bubble, Bill, and look around you, maybe follow some real non-blue checked people, you\u2019d get a clue. You have no idea what\u2019s going on in the real world. \u2014 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\ude0eMAMADOXIE\ud83e\udd2c\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@Mamadoxie) October 5, 2019\n\nSucks to be you, loser. \u2014 Kevin Barry Maguire (@Drathzaar) October 5, 2019\n\nI see Kristol has finally found a way to get retweets: post polls in which he is abjectly humiliated. \u2014 BattleSwarm (@BattleSwarmBlog) October 5, 2019\n\nWhom do you respect more? \u2014 Uri Blago (@UriBlago) October 5, 2019\n\nI wouldn\u2019t delight in your demise so much but you get crushed ONLY when you are trying to hurt someone else\u2026so you totally deserve it. \u2014 Steph (@steph93065) October 5, 2019\n\nWill Bill consider that he may be the hellscape? \u2014 kerry \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@K1erry) October 5, 2019\n\nAppears you have a continuous need for that overwhelming feeling of great disappointment. \u2014 Deborah Wotton (@Mydesigningmind) October 5, 2019\n\nlol! Like you, Romney is also a loser \u2014 Obi_1_D_AllKnowing \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@obiopiah) October 5, 2019\n\nOnly losers respect other losers, Bill. This is why we dumped the whole lot of you for a winner. \u2014 Steph (@steph93065) October 5, 2019\n\nHow's that twitter poll working out for you, Bill. This puts you into the same category as Rosie. You two make a great couple. \u2014 Lonely Libertarian (@FrankLasCPA) October 5, 2019\n\nGet a life loser and get off twitter fool. \u2014 CC (@ChatByCC) October 5, 2019\n\nIs Bill Kristol relevant? \u2014 Caleb SkHull \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@CalebJHull) October 5, 2019\n\nThere was a time when I respected you. That time has passed. \u2014 KnoxvegasMike (@mlittle101) October 5, 2019\n\nHave you see the pic of Mitt begging Trump to be Secretary of State? He doesn\u2019t even respect himself. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) October 5, 2019\n\nAnother leftist \u201cpoll\u201d by the fakest Republican to announce their political party affiliation. If Billy was ever a \u201cRepublican\u201d then I\u2019ve always been a Democrat. Get a life, Billy. The only people against President Trump are those who can\u2019t bear all this winning! But I regress. \u2014 S.L. Stiles (@StacyLStiles) October 5, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know you are, but you seem to be really bad at polling. \u2014 TangoRomeo (@TangoRomeo20) October 5, 2019\n\nTrump might be a crass loud mouth but at least he has a spine. Mitt on the other hand is civil but is a complete push over. \u2014 Skyler (@evo4g63t) October 5, 2019\n\nit\u2019s 2019 and you still haven\u2019t figured out that twitter polls will always backfire on you \u2014 Caleb SkHull \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf83\ud83d\udc7b (@CalebJHull) October 5, 2019\n\nIt's 2019 and he still hasn't figured out that @SenatorRomney has been rejected by the @GOP base. \u2014 MrLarsonTD (@larson_td) October 5, 2019\n\n\u201cTwitter is a hellscape precisely to the extent people don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d That how it works? \u2014 Jhon Simth (@JhonSimth) October 5, 2019\n\nAnd to the extent that #MAGA hurts my feelings by hi-jacking my polls \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 I'm supposed to be whistle-blowing right now\u2026 (@hereforthejava) October 5, 2019\n\nRomney is a good man but he is weak. He does not have the stamina to take what democrats constantly dish out. Romney surrenders into their madness. @POTUS takes them to task when he knows he is right, he stands up for it. \u2014 judy lynn (@KaiKelDav) October 5, 2019\n\nI eagerly supported Romney in '12. Saw he was right about Russia, had successful business background I thought would work well as president. If any other GOP candidate had done what Trump is doing, he'd be a strong supporter. But he's let his personal dislike of DJT kill that. \u2014 Death's Guinea Pig 4.0 (@Bernie_Gilbert) October 5, 2019\n\nThe poll still has 17 hours to go, and the Romney fans are already declaring that \u201cbots\u201d have taken over the voting. If we remember we\u2019ll check back in when this thing is over and see how well Kristol\u2019s boy did.\n\nRelated:", "description": "Bill Kristol seems to enjoy posting Twitter polls in which he's humiliated.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bill-kristol.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
