But the writers of Porridge told how they nevertheless wanted audiences to know that \u2018prison is not fun\u2019\n\nFletcher voices his unhappiness at having to share a cell because he thought he would be on his own - and attempts to impose strict rules on his younger cellmate.\n\nClement said: \u2018We felt prison\u2019s about being locked up and we should have at least (once) where the whole episode takes place within a cell.\n\n\u2018Godber\u2019s admitting that he\u2019s scared and he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to get through.\u2019\n\nDescribing how the famous one-liner from the 1970s series came about, La Frenais said: \u2018Ronnie would come up with a gag.\n\n\u2018He was a lovely man, Ronnie. He\u2019d say, I thought of this and would run it by you, in respect of the writer, and we said, well, of course. Of course it\u2019s fine.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s true that most of our comedy comes out of character. It\u2019s organic... We don\u2019t go round in circles because we\u2019ve thought of a funny gag. It\u2019s never been our thing.\u2019\n\nClement added: \u2018We\u2019ve never seen ourselves as gag writers. Occasionally a gag comes along and we\u2019d pick it up and use it but we don\u2019t really go out of our way to create gags as such.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s always comedy in life anyway.\u2019\n\nThey recalled how Frank Muir, then assistant head of light entertainment at the corporation, told them [that the Likely Lads , pictured above] \u2018it wouldn\u2019t do anything but it\u2019s cheap\u2019. Rodney Brewes is pictured left as Bob Ferris, and James Bolam is seen as Terry Collier\n\nCiting some of their other creations - such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which follows a group of out-of-work British tradesmen forced to look for work in West Germany - Clement said: \u2018We wanted Auf Wiedersehen, Pet to feel real and we never saw that as a comedy series by the way, we just wanted to let the comedy, if there was any, to come out of it.\u2019\n\nThe pair, who have spent recent decades mostly working in Hollywood, also revealed their first big hit, The Likely Lads, was viewed as an unlikely hit when first commissioned in the early days of BBC2.\n\nIt was chosen because the corporation did not have to pay them much for the script, as they were not well-known at the time.\n\nThey recalled how Frank Muir, then assistant head of light entertainment at the corporation, told them \u2018it wouldn\u2019t do anything but it\u2019s cheap\u2019.\n\nClement, 82, and La Frenais, 83, say they are still working in the film industry in America but are having difficulties because it is prioritising productions based on \u2018video games, graphic novels and Marvel comics\u2019.\n\nClement said: \u2018It\u2019s not us. We try to write grown-up movies so there\u2019s less opportunities although we\u2019ve got four screenplays in various states of development.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no question about it, as you get older, you get more marginalised.\u2019\n\nBut the writers said they would not criticise current sitcoms and \u2018there\u2019s never been a better time to be a writer\u2019 due to the number of companies and channels around.", "description": "Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais also revealed Ronnie Barker, who starred as scheming inmate Norman Stanley Fletcher, came up with his own jokes which were written into the script.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/00/19763738-0-image-a-23_1571181006947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
