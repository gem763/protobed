Robert Herring offered $1 million to Schiavo's husband to stop trying to get her off life support. He refused and Schiavo died in 2005 after her feeding tube was removed.\n\nWealth TV also partially made its name with a live professional boxing event aired in 2011 and a pay-per-view fight in 2012.", "description": "One America News is a lesser-known TV outlet that has earned Trump's seal of approval and a growing audience.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da47de44af90927850b88af?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
