Rather than directly hosting the pirated files, Pirate Bay hosts torrents - a kind of data file that enables people with torrenting software to them download files directly from other users.\n\nTorrenting itself isn't inherently illegal: It's a way of distributing file downloads across a variety of users that enables rapid file downloading without any one user footing the bandwidth bill.\n\nIn that way, The Pirate Bay skirts the illegality of pirated intellectual property - users aren't downloading pirated material directly from The Pirate Bay, they're just downloading torrent files. Those torrent files enable users to download pirated material.\n\nIn the prompt on Facebook that stops users from sharing links to The Pirate Bay, it says links to the site \"goes against our community standards.\" Though it's not explicitly clear, the standard this appears to violate falls under the \"Respecting Intellectual Property\" section, which states, \"We are committed to helping people and organisations promote and protect their intellectual property rights. Facebook's Terms of Service do not allow people to post content that violates someone else's intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Facebook and The Pirate Bay didn't respond to a request as of publishing.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "Facebook no longer allows its billions of users to share links to world's most well-known piracy website, The Pirate Bay.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9418/a993b5f78e9a47a6bf4e8642f8523b16.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
