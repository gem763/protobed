To be fair, none of them are proposing full-scale Soviet-style central planning.\n\nBut it is fair to say that they envision something akin to Japan\u2019s policies in the 1980s.\n\nSome of them even explicitly argue we should copy China\u2019s current policies.\n\nIn a column for the New York Times, Julius Krein celebrates the fact that Marco Rubio and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez both believe politicians should have more power over the economy.\n\n\u2026a few years ago, the phrase \u201cindustrial policy\u201d was employed mainly as a term of abuse. Economists almost universally insisted that state interventions to improve competitiveness, prioritize investment in strategic sectors and structure market incentives around political goals were backward policies doomed to failure \u2014 whether applied in America, Asia or anywhere in between. \u2026In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, however, the Reagan-Bush-Clinton neoliberal consensus seems intellectually and politically bankrupt. \u2026a growing number of politicians and intellectuals\u2026are finding common ground under the banner of industrial policy. Even the typically neoliberal Financial Times editorial board recently argued in favor of industrial policy, calling on the United States to \u201cdrop concerns around state planning.\u201d \u2026Why now? The United States has essentially experienced two lost decades, and inequality has reached Gilded Age levels. \u2026United States industry is losing ground to foreign competitors on price, quality and technology. In many areas, our manufacturing capacity cannot compete with what exists in Asia.\n\nThere are some very sloppy assertions in the above passages.\n\nYou can certainly argue that Reagan and Clinton had similar \u201cneoliberal\u201d policies (i.e., classical liberal), but Bush was a statist.\n\nAlso, the Financial Times very much leans to the left. Not crazy Sanders-Corbyn leftism, but consistently in favor of a larger role for government.\n\nAnyhow, what exactly does Mr. Krein have in mind?\n\nMore spending, more intervention, and more cronyism.\n\nA successful American industrial policy would draw on replicable foreign models as well as take lessons from our history. Some simple first steps would be to update the Small Business Investment Company and Small Business Innovation Research programs \u2014 which played a role in catalyzing Silicon Valley decades ago \u2014 to focus more on domestic hardware businesses. \u2026Government agencies could also step in to seed investment funds focused on strategic industries and to incentivize commercial lending to key sectors, policies that have proven successful in other countries\u2026 the United States needs to invest more in applied research\u2026 Elizabeth Warren has also proposed a government-sponsored research and licensing model for the pharmaceutical industry, which could be applied to other industries as well. \u2026Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, has called for the creation of a National Institute of Manufacturing, taking inspiration from the National Institutes of Health. \u2026A successful industrial policy would aim to strengthen worker bargaining power while organizing and training a better skilled labor force. Industrial policy also involves, and even depends upon, rebuilding infrastructure.\n\nIn other words, if you like the so-called Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s corporate cronyism, you\u2019ll love all the other ideas for additional government intervention.\n\nOren Cass of the Manhattan Institute also wants to give politicians more control over the private economy.\n\nMy argument rests on three claims\u2026 First, that market economies do not automatically allocate resources well across sectors. Second, that policymakers have tools that can support vital sectors that might otherwise suffer from underinvestment\u2014I will call those tools \u201cindustrial policy.\u201d Third, that while the policies produced by our political system will be far from ideal, efforts at sensible industrial policy can improve upon our status quo, which is itself far from ideal. \u2026Our popular obsession with manufacturing isn\u2019t some nostalgic anachronism. \u2026manufacturing is unique for the complexity of its supply chains and the interaction between innovation and production. \u2026the case for industrial policy requires recognition not only of certain sectors\u2019 value, but also that the market will overlook the value in theory and that we are underinvesting in practice. That the free market will not solve this should be fairly self-evident\u2026 Manufacturing output is only 12% of GDP in America\u2026 Productivity growth has slowed nationwide, even flatlining in recent years. Wages have stagnated. Our trade deficit has skyrocketed.\n\nSo what are his solutions?\n\nLike Julius Krein, he wants government intervention. Lots of it.\n\nFund basic research across the sciences\u2026 Fund applied research\u2026 Support private-sector R&D and commercialization with subsidies and specialized institutes\u2026 Increase infrastructure investment\u2026 Bias the tax code in favor of profits generated from the productive use of labor\u2026 Retaliate aggressively against mercantilist countries that undermine market competition\u2026 Tax foreign acquisition of U.S. assets, making U.S. goods relatively more attractive\u2026 Impose local content requirements in key supply chains like communications\u2026 Libertarians often posit an ideal world of policy non-intervention as superior to the messy reality of policy action. But that ideal does not exist\u2014messy reality is the only reality\u2026 That\u2019s especially the case here, because you can have free trade, or you can have free markets, but you can\u2019t have both.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse, an infrastructure boondoggle or a tax on inbound investment?\n\nMore tinkering with the tax code, or more handouts for industries?\n\nAnd here are excerpts from a column for the Daily Caller by Robert Atkinson.\n\nWhen the idea first surfaced in the late 1970s that the United States should adopt a national industrial policy, mainstream \u201cfree market\u201d conservatives decried it as one step away from handing the reins of the economy over to a state planning committee like the Soviet Gosplan. But now, \u2026the idea has been getting a fresh look among some conservatives who argue that, absent an industrial strategy, America will be at a competitive disadvantage. \u2026Conservatives\u2019 skepticism of industrial policy perhaps stems from the idea\u2019s origins. It started gaining currency during the Carter administration, with many traditional Democratic party interests, including labor unions and politicians in the Northeast and Midwest, arguing for a strong federal role\u2026 However, over the next decade, as economic competitors like Germany and Japan began to challenge the United States in consumer electronics, autos, and even high-tech industries like computer chips, the focus of debates about industrial policy broadened to encompass overall U.S. competitiveness. \u2026There was a bipartisan response\u2026that collectively amounted to a first draft of a national industrial policy\u2026 But as the economic challenge from Japan receded\u2026, interest in industrial policies waned. \u2026The newly dominant neoclassical economists preached that the U.S. \u201crecipe\u201d of free markets, property rights, and entrepreneurial spirit inoculated America against any and all economic threats.\n\nAs with Krein and Cass, Atkinson wants to copy the failed interventionist policies of other nations.\n\nBut that was then and this is now \u2014 a now where we face intense competition from China. \u2026Increasingly leaders across the political spectrum are returning to a notion that we should put the national interest at the center of economic policies, and that free-market globalization doesn\u2019t necessarily do that\u2026 Conservatives increasingly realize that without some kind of industrial policy the United States will fall behind China, with significant national security and economic implications. \u2026So, what would a conservative-inspired, market-strengthening industrial policy look like? \u2026it would acknowledge that America\u2019s \u201ctraded sector\u201d industries are critical to our future competitiveness\u2026 The right industrial policy will advance prosperity more than laisse-faire capitalism would. \u2026there are a significant number of market failures around innovation, including externalities, network failures, system interdependencies, and the public-goods nature of technology platforms. \u2026this is why only government can \u201cpick winners.\u201d \u2026It should mean expanding supports for exporters by ensuring the Ex-Im Bank has adequate lending authority\u2026 this debate boils down to a fundamental choice for conservatives: small government and liberty versus stronger\u2026government that delivers economic security\n\nWhat\u2019s a \u201cmarket-strengthening industrial policy\u201d? Is that like a \u201cgrowth-stimulating tax increase\u201d? Or a \u201cwork-ethic-enhancing welfare program\u201d?\n\nI realize I\u2019m being snarky, but how else should I respond to someone who actually wants to expand the cronyist Export-Import Bank?\n\nLet\u2019s now look at what\u2019s wrong with industrial policy.\n\nIn a column for Reason, Veronique de Rugy of the Mercatus Center warns that American politicians who favor industrial policy are misreading China\u2019s economic history.\n\n\u2026calls from politicians on both sides of the aisle to implement industrial policy. \u2026These policies are tired, utterly uninspiring schemes that governments around the world have tried and, invariably, failed at. \u2026As for the notion that \u201cother countries are doing it,\u201d I\u2019m curious to hear what great successes have come out of, say, China\u2019s industrial policies. In his latest book, The State Strikes Back: The End of Economic Reform in China?, Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute for International Economics shows that China\u2019s growth since 1978 has actually been the product of market-oriented reforms, not state-owned programs. \u2026Why should we want America to become more like China? Here\u2019s yet another politician thinking that somehow, the same government that\u2026botched the launch of HealthCare.gov, gave us the Solyndra scandal, and can keep neither Amtrak nor the Postal Service solvent, can effectively coordinate a strategic vision for American manufacturing. \u2026The real problem with industrial policy, economic development strategy, central planning, or whatever you want to call these interventions is that government officials\u2026cannot outperform the wisdom of the market at picking winners. In fact, government intervention in any sector creates distortions, misdirects investments toward politically favored companies, and hinders the ability of unsubsidized competitors to offer better alternatives. Central planning in all forms is poisonous to innovation.\n\nAs usual, Veronique is spot one.\n\nI\u2019ve also explained that China\u2019s economy is being held back by statist policies.\n\nVeronique also addressed the topic of industrial policy in a column for the New York Times,\n\nWith \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d Beijing\u2019s 2015 anticapitalist plan for an industrial policy under which the state would pick \u201cwinners,\u201d China has taken a step back from capitalism. \u2026China\u2019s new industrial policy has worked one marvel \u2014 namely, scaring many American conservatives into believing that the main driver of economic growth isn\u2019t the market but bureaucrats invested with power to control the allocation of natural and financial resources. \u2026I thought we learned this lesson after many American intellectuals, economists and politicians were proven spectacularly wrong in predicting that the Soviet Union would become an economic rival. \u2026government officials cannot outperform the market at picking winners. In practice it ends up picking losers or hindering the abilities of the winners to achieve their greatest potential. Central planning is antithetical to innovation, as is already visible in China. \u2026the United States has instituted industrial policies in the past out of unwarranted fears of other countries\u2019 industrial policies. The results have always imposed great costs on consumers and taxpayers and introduced significant economic distortions. \u2026Conservatives\u2026should learn about the failed United States industrial policies of the 1980s, which were responses to the Japanese government\u2019s attempt to dominate key consumer electronics technologies. These efforts worked neither in Japan nor in the United States. The past has taught us that industrial policies fail often because they favor existing industries that are well connected politically at the expense of would-be entrepreneurs\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t allow fear-mongering to hobble America\u2019s free enterprise system.\n\nAmen.\n\nMy modest contribution to this discussion is to share one of my experiences as a relative newcomer to D.C. in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nI had to fight all sorts of people who said that Japan was eating our lunch and that the United States needed industrial policy.\n\nI kept pointing out that Japan deserved some praise for its post-WWII shift to markets, but that the country\u2019s economy was being undermined by corporatism, intervention, and industrial policy.\n\nAt the time, I remember being mocked for my supposed naivete. But the past 30 years have proven me right.\n\nNow it\u2019s deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra might say.\n\nExcept now China is the bogeyman. Which doesn\u2019t make much sense since China lags behind the United States far more than Japan lagged the U.S. in the 1980s (per-capita output in China, at best, in only one-fourth of American levels).\n\nAnd China will never catch the U.S. if it relies on industrial policy instead of pro-market reform.\n\nSo why should American policy makers copy China\u2019s mistakes?\n\nP.S. There is a separate issue involving national security, where there may be legitimate reasons to deny China access to high-end technology or to make sure American defense firms don\u2019t have to rely on China for inputs. But that\u2019s not an argument for industrial policy.\n\nP.P.S. There is a separate issue involving trade, where there may be legitimate reasons to pressure China so that it competes fairly and behaves honorably. But that\u2019s not an argument for industrial policy.", "description": "Ronald Reagan must be turning over in his grave.A Republican .10/02/2019 12:20:41PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
