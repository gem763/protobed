He holds news conferences about as often as Washington makes the playoffs, but there was no avoiding this one.\n\nIt was time to take questions and provide answers, a daunting task for team executives with a 59-92-1 record. However, Allen was ready. He had committed his talking points to memory and was prepared to repeat them like a needle skipping on vinyl albums.\n\nWe\u2019re all disappointed. We\u2019re not hiding from our record. We\u2019re going to keep working.\n\nHe was big on \u201cwe,\u201d not so much on \u201cI.\u201d When asked directly about his personal accountability for Washington\u2019s sorry state of affairs, Allen stayed stuck in the groove. \u201cWe\u2019re all involved in this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI absolutely want what\u2019s best for the Washington Redskins and we\u2019re going to make sure we do it.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, he should fire himself. Owner Dan Snyder clearly won\u2019t do it, making you wonder what he sees.\n\nThe problems are more obvious than the Tom Brady jerseys at FedEx Field Sunday. Wins have been few and fans are growing scarce. Respect for the franchise has been replaced with derision, giving scholars a fascinating case study in reputation mismanagement. Once a heavyweight among NFL brands, Washington is less than a paperweight today.\n\nSadly, Allen and Snyder are either too arrogant to admit it, or too obtuse to recognize it.\n\n\u201cAll we can do is to try to improve tomorrow,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAll we can deal with is today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe wants you to know that, honest-to-goodness, they\u2019re trying to reverse course. They\u2019re working really hard and they really care. Everyone does, including the folks at FedEx Field. \u201cI see what the people do at the stadium; they\u2019re great workers,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThey care about this team and they care about this franchise.\u201d\n\nThe president and owner apparently didn\u2019t have those warm feelings for the former coach.\n\nAllen said the decision to fire Gruden was made around 8 p.m. Sunday night. Interim coach Bill Callahan said he received a call that evening and discussed taking over. But Gruden wasn\u2019t told his services no longer were desired until he showed up Monday for a 5 a.m. meeting, maybe after a sleepless night.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about Gruden.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a great head coach and you could argue he wasn\u2019t a particularly good one, either. There were legitimate concerns about his ability in terms of discipline, preparation and game management. He drew up some sweet plays to get guys open, but leading the entire team wasn\u2019t his strong suit.\n\nBut pick a coach. Bill Belichick. Nick Saban. Mike Tomlin. Dabo Swinney.\n\nNot one of them would thrive with this franchise as currently constructed. Not with Allen lording over the football and business operations, both sides of Snyder\u2019s crater-ridden aisle. Not in a culture that Allen incredulously labeled \u201cdamn good,\u201d but is more like \u201cnoxious dysfunction.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview on 106.7 The Fan\u2019s \u201cGrant & Danny,\u201d Washington legend Joe Theismann said a losing football organization can only make two moves to turn things around \u2014 change the coach or change the QB.\n\nHmm. He\u2019s definitely missing a position. (Hint: It\u2019s not the owner.)\n\nSnyder selling the team is as likely as Allen giving himself a pink slip. Neither is going to happen. But if Snyder squelched interference from his suite, quarantined Allen, and retained a credible football executive with autonomy and authority, that would be a great first step toward restoration.\n\nAnything else represents tired steps in a 20-year-old circle.\n\nIt\u2019s a trek that Allen is prepared to repeat, hand-in-hand with the hoodwinked owner.\n\n\u201cThe pieces are here for a winning team,\u201d Allen said Monday, offering a version of his \u201cwe\u2019re close\u201d whopper from January. \u201cWe have to put them in the right place, believe in each other and keep fighting for a goal.\u201d\n\nOf course, he considers himself one of the pieces. And thinks he\u2019s in the right place. And wants everyone to believe in him.\n\nTruth be told, you and I would feel likewise in his position.\n\nThink about it. He has a nice gig. He whispers sweet nothings in the boss\u2019s ear and escapes blame. He continues to cash paychecks despite dismal results. Who wouldn\u2019t want to keep that gravy flowing?\n\nAnother cycle is set to begin anew, fresh blood in the coach\u2019s office and, eventually, a fresh face at quarterback (maybe from the 2020 draft?). It\u2019s the Allen way, selling hope instead of wins and fantasy instead of reality.\n\nThe formula works great for him.\n\nEveryone else is on their own.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
