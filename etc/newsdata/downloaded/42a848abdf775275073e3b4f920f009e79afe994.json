Walmart\u2019s gone weak-kneed.\n\nAs if stopping legal gun buyers and legal ammunition purchasers and legal firearms\u2019 carriers would stop gun-related crimes in its tracks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the status quo is unacceptable,\u201d wrote CEO and President Doug McMillon in a letter to Walmart associates that was widely reported in the press.\n\nHe went on to lay out the company\u2019s new policy \u2014 to discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle and handgun ammunition; to discontinue handgun sales in Alaska; and to \u201crespectfully\u201d request \u201cthat customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam\u2019s Clubs in states where \u2018open carry\u2019 is permitted \u2014 unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cWe believe the opportunity for someone to misinterpret a situation, even in open carry states, could lead to tragic results,\u201d McMillon went on.\n\nThat makes absolutely no sense.\n\nWhat\u2019s to misinterpret about a legal firearm carrier openly carrier a firearm? It says bluntly: Don\u2019t mess with me.\n\nAnd why would Walmart elevate police above citizens on the Second Amendment chain, and allow for their open carry \u2014 but not someone who perhaps, ostensibly, quite possibly, has more firing experience than even many members of law enforcement?\n\n\u201cAs an additional step, we commit we will work alongside other retailers to make the overall industry safer, including sharing our best practices,\u201d McMillon wrote.\n\nThat means Walmart is going to put the screws on companies that want to place products on its corporate shelves to adopt similar anti-gun policies.\n\nMcMillon also made clear he\u2019s going to use his corporate platform to pressure politicians to adopt universal background checks\u2019 laws and ban, nationwide, the likes of \u201cmilitary-style rifles.\u201d\n\nAnd then he wrapped with the anti-gun movement\u2019s signature show of appeasement \u2014 he made clear he\u2019s \u201ca gun owner myself.\u201d He understands. He feels the tradition.\n\nHe feels the Second Amendment right.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing to keep in mind: McMillon\u2019s new policy will accomplish nothing in terms of curbing gun violence in this nation. Nothing.\n\nThat Texas shooter, the one who shot and killed 22? He had been banned from buying any firearms already because of mental illness.\n\nIt just can\u2019t be stated enough, or underlined too many times. Guns don\u2019t kill people; people firing guns kill people. And simply outlawing guns gives the criminals the edge because it strips a crucial ability to self-defend from the law-abiding.\n\nIf McMillon\u2019s real intent here was to help stop gun-related violence, maybe he should\u2019ve banned the mentally ill from entering his stores around the nation. That would\u2019ve at least touched on a root of gun-related violence.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty stupid. But then, so is barring sales of guns and ammunition to law-abiding citizens.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
