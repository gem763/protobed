Indira Gandhi stepped in as the president of the Congress party of India in the late 1950\u2019s. As history speaks she took a lot of controversial political decisions which is indicative of her bold personality that she had. An interview with Femina in the mid 70\u2019s takes us back to the regime of the dynamic PM of India.You see, happiness means different things to different people. The whole trend of modern civilization not only in India but all over the world is towards wanting more things. Therefore nobody is happy, they aren\u2019t happy in the richest of countries. But I would say that a very large number of Indian women is better off in the sense that she has greater freedom and a better status in the society. My idea of the Indian women\u2019s movement is not that women should necessarily occupy high positions but that the average woman should have better status and should be respected in the society. We have moved in the right direction but there are still millions of women who are not aware of their rights and responsibilitiesI wouldn\u2019t say there are fewer women in political life now. There are fewer women in parliament perhaps because before they had so much equality, a very special effort was made but I think the State or the party can\u2019t help them in the same way. We do try to help them but elections are becoming much tougher. Before anybody could get elected. But now if the local people say that so and so cannot be elected, we have to rely on their judgement which may be wrong sometimes but we have very little choice.Till quite recently, no other party except the congress and communists really paid any attention to women as political identities. But now of course they are trying to woo women but more to make use of them than to give them status.Education must be in touch with the life of the community. It just cannot be divorced from it. It must prepare our young women to grow into mature and well-adjusted people. If you are mature and well-adjusted you can learn anything at any age but if you mug up something, you know just that much and you may forget it so your education becomes wasted. We are now trying to make education more broad-based, to have greater vocational training. But I don\u2019t think education should be confined to vocational training because suppose that vocation doesn\u2019t find a place in the changing society, then again the person will be uprooted. So the real purpose id not so much what the person knows as to what the person becomes that is if you become the right kind of person, you can tackle most problems and today\u2019s life has more problems than ever before and much of this burden falls specially on women because they have to keep the harmony in the home. So in education, a woman can\u2019t really confine herself in domestic science because a very important part of life is how you get on with other people, your husband, parents, children and so on.Yes, because she guides the child during the most impressionable years and whatever is instilled in her child then remains for the rest of his life no matter how old he is. She is the one who even for the menfolk creates the atmosphere in the home.Indira Gandhi\u2019s legacy lives on today as her daughter in law Sonia Gandhi , as the president of the Indian Congress Party.", "description": "Indira Gandhi stepped in as the president of the Congress party of India in the late 1950\u2019s Indira Gandhi stepped in as the president of the Congress party of I", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://femina.wwmindia.com/content/2019/sep/femina11568894686.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
