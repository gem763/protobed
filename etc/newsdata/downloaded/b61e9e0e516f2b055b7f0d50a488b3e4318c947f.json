The two partygoers who were killed were not identified.\n\nThe investigation, which was being aided by the Texas Rangers and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was hampered by a lack of cooperation from those in attendance, Meeks said.\n\n\u201cIt appalls me that as many folks that were there have not been able to give us a better description of this shooter,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had interviewed 20 people.\n\n\u201cWith this many people there, normally we would have a really good description of the shooter,\u201d he added.\n\nLater, on Sunday night, gunfire erupted during a vigil held for the victims shot at the homecoming party, an NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reporter, tweeted.\n\n\u201cOur news unit was hit at least three times,\u201d she said, adding that she had not seen anyone injured.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department was not immediately available to comment on reports regarding gunfire at the vigil.", "description": "Texas police said they were seeking a gunman on Sunday who fired randomly at a Halloween homecoming party packed with hundreds of college students, leaving at least two dead and wounding about a dozen more, before fleeing amid the chaos that followed.", "authors": ["Peter Szekely", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
