We were able to weave our way through.\n\n\"This was a huge, huge race for us. I'm pumped up. I don't know what to say. We're moving on!\"\n\nRyan @Blaney WINS in a PHOTO finish at @TalladegaSuperS!\n\n\n\nHe's moving on to the next round of the #NASCARPlayoffs! pic.twitter.com/dHhj6An4uH \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 14, 2019\n\nCrashes marred the race that took place over two days after it was postponed Sunday by rain following the first stage. The race picked up Monday with the beginning of Stage 2, and wrecks soon followed.\n\nThree separate major multi-car crashes hit the field, with the first coming at the end of Stage 2, which ended the day for three Chevrolets, including the playoff cars of Alex Bowman and Kyle Larson. After two more major wrecks in the third stage, nearly all of the playoff drivers \u2014 save Blaney \u2014 had suffered some damage.\n\nAlex Bowman (88), Jimmie Johnson (48) and Kyle Larson (42) suffer race-ending damage in a multicar crash as Kurt Busch (1) slips by on the bottom lane during the 1000bulbs.com 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.

Aric Almirola, who pushed Blaney to the front on the restart, finished fourth, Michael McDowell fifth, Austin Dillon sixth, Corey LaJoie seventh, Chase Elliott eighth, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. ninth and Ty Dillon 10th.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to not win that one, to be so close,\" Newman said. \"I\u2019ve been that close here before. Quite a few years I\u2019ve tried, but just crazy racing and proud to get our Wyndham Rewards Ford a good finish.\n\n\"I\u2019ve always said you\u2019ve got to lose some that way before you can win some that way, and I guess our wins are coming.\u201d\n\nBlaney's victory was the sixth win in a row for Ford in Talladega playoff races and the seventh win in the last 11 Cup Series race at Talladega for Team Penske.\n\nRyan Blaney celebrates after winning the continuation of the 1000Bulbs.com 500 at Talladega Superspeedway.

That set off a multi-car collision, which sent Brendan Gaughan's No. 62 airborne, where it flipped upside down before landing on its tires and into Kurt Busch. Kevin Harvick, Chris Buescher, Matt DiBenedetto, David Ragan, Daniel Hemric and Stenhouse were also collected in the huge crash.\n\n\"THE NO. 62 UPSIDE DOWN!\"\n\n\n\nBrendan Gaughan flips in this MASSIVE CRASH at @TalladegaSuperS! pic.twitter.com/HXNYWD7ksx \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 14, 2019\n\nBIG ONE PART II: William Byron, running near the front of the inside lane, got a push from Kurt Busch, which sent him spinning into Joey Logano and started a chain reaction. Daniel Suarez, Ryan Preece, Erik Jones, Matt Crafton and Joey Gase were also involved in the multi-car wreck. Byron and Jones suffered race-ending damage, while Logano's No. 22 needed major repairs on pit road to get him back on the track.\n\nJoey Logano almost rolled over!\n\n\n\nCheck out this slow-motion replay of the second Big One of the day. #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/rVcAZqw5y1 \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 14, 2019\n\nSTAGE 2: Following the massive multicar crash in the closing laps, the second segment ended under caution. Clint Bowyer earned the stage victory and a playoff point. Logano finished second for the second consecutive stage. He was followed by Penske teammate Keselowski, Austin Dillon, Suarez, Blaney, Buescher, Kurt Busch, Byron and Kyle Busch.\n\nWATCH: Wild and memorable NASCAR crashes at Talladega\n\nTRIUMPHANT RETURN: Inspiring Harvick tire changer back for final stretch\n\nOPINION: Did failure to make NASCAR playoffs cost Stenhouse his ride?\n\nBIG ONE STRIKES: Bowman, who was leading the race, got a huge shove from Joey Logano on Lap 108, which sent him into a spin that collected a number of cars, including two of Bowman's Hendrick Motorsports teammates \u2014 Jimmie Johnson and Elliott. Larson, who had already clinched a berth in the Round of 8 with his victory at Dover last weekend, had his car totaled. Martin Truex Jr., Hamlin, Harvick and Preece were also involved, but Bowman, Johnson and Larson suffered the worst of the damage and were eliminated from the race.\n\n\"My guess is that I threw a block I shouldn't have,\" Bowman said. \"I got shoved way out there. I knew the No. 22 (Logano) was coming, and I just tried to move down just a little bit. As soon as he touched me, it just turned it sideways.\n\n\"They just had a bigger run than I realized. I should have let them go and shouldn't have thrown a block.\"\n\nDRIVER SWITCH: Crafton, a champion of the NASCAR Truck Series, took over driving duties from Paul Menard in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Ford following Stage 1. Menard had been experiencing severe neck pain at Talladega, and Crafton, who finished eighth in Saturday's Trucks race, had been on stand-by for Menard all weekend.\n\nPOSTPONED: Following the end of opening stage, rain started failing, prompting NASCAR to throw the red flag direct cars down pit road on lap 57. The red flag lasted roughly one hour and 30 minutes before NASCAR officials announced the remainder of the race would be rescheduled for Monday. The 2.666-mile Talladega track \u2014 NASCAR's largest \u2014 does not have lights, so racing at night was not an option.\n\nSTAGE 1: Byron took the opening stage and earned a playoff point on Sunday. Four Hendrick Chevrolets swept the top four spots in Saturday's qualifying and three \u2014 Byron, Bowman and Johnson \u2014 finished in the top seven of the first segment.\n\nWilliam Byron held them all off to win Stage 1 at Talladega, presented by @Kroger#ClickList! pic.twitter.com/sjDX5GD90S \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 13, 2019\n\nLogano took second, followed by Bowman, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Keselowski.
