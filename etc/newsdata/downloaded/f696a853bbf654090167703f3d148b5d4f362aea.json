The backlash from China was immediate and is ongoing, and the Houston franchise and the NBA have been in damage-control mode for days. On Tuesday, China\u2019s state broadcaster, CCTV, canceled broadcasts of NBA games in China.\n\nChina\u2019s growing economic might has meant that dozens of foreign firms and public figures have now been forced to publicly apologize \u2014 some would say grovel \u2014 after taking actions or making statements that offended China or its people. In many cases, the Chinese government as well as state and non\u2013state media have fanned the anger.\n\nFor the global brands, the calculation is simple: \u201cHurt the feelings of the Chinese people\u201d \u2014 a common refrain from officials in China \u2014 and face potentially enormous losses in sales, endorsements, market access or reputation.\n\nSee: Apple blasted by China\u2019s state media for \u2018unwise and reckless decision\u2019 to allow apps that help Hong Kong protesters\n\nHere, then, is a brief history of selected recent cases in which notable brands have found themselves seeking forgiveness after upsetting China or the Chinese people:\n\nDolce & Gabbana: Last November the Italian luxury brand released a series of video ads featuring a Chinese woman struggling to eat pizza and other \u201cWestern\u201d food with chopsticks. This created some degree of discontent among social-media users, but that turned to widespread outrage when leaked messages emerged in which co-founder Stefano Gabbana defended the videos and made disparaging remarks about Chinese people.\n\nThe company was forced to cancel several fashion shows, celebrities refrained from wearing D&G clothing at public events, and nearly one year later the firm\u2019s items are absent from several Chinese e-commerce sites. D&G also expects sales to continue falling this fiscal year, Reuters reported. All this despite a broad campaign by the company to rectify its brand status in a country that now commands one-third of luxury sales.\n\nMarriott: In early 2018, Marriott International MAR, +0.96% listed Hong Kong, Macau, Tibet and Taiwan as independent countries on a survey it sent to members of its rewards program. Not only was it forced to apologize to the Chinese government, but it agreed to temporarily shutter its Chinese websites and apps, until it could \u201crectify\u201d its blunder.\n\nSeparately last year, the company profusely apologized after an employee liked a social-media post about Tibet. The worker was quickly fired.\n\nInternational airlines: Last year a succession of U.S. and other foreign airlines found themselves facing Beijing\u2019s ire for listing Taiwan and Hong Kong as independent entities on their booking websites. The Civil Aviation Administration of China sent letters to a total of 44 airlines demanding they ensure their websites refer to Taiwan as a part of China. Though Taiwan is a self-ruled democratic state, many airlines complied. The Trump administration in the U.S. called Beijing\u2019s move \u201cOrwellian nonsense.\u201d\n\nVersace: Dolce & Gabbana wasn\u2019t the only Italian fashion house to run afoul of Beijing. This summer, Versace CPRI, -0.18% released a shirt that listed Hong Kong and Macau as independent entities. The swift backlash resulted in the company issuing its \u201cdeepest apologies,\u201d and even destroying the remaining inventory of the shirts. Versace\u2019s Chinese brand ambassador, actress Yang Mi, terminated her relationship with the company.\n\nGap: The Gap GPS, +0.94% apologized last year after it was found to be selling a T-shirt featuring a map of China that omitted Taiwan. The American company apologized and said it \u201crespects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China.\u201d\n\nZara: Spanish brand Zara, a unit of Inditex ITX, +1.02% , faced a different source of anger after it closed a store in Hong Kong on a day when widespread pro-democracy protests were expected. Mainland netizens interpreted the store closure as a solidarity boycott, though Zara said it simply expected staff to be unable to commute as transport was essentially shut down in much of the city.\n\nThe list goes on: This partial list could go on, but the circumstances are similar with other brands that have angered Beijing. The commonest source of wrath is offending China\u2019s territorial integrity, something that for 70 years has been the country\u2019s most sensitive issue.\n\nGlobal brands, many of which are used to operating in freer countries with a wider berth for marketing foibles, must decide how much they value access to one of the world\u2019s most important markets.\n\nTanner Brown is a contributor to MarketWatch and Barron\u2019s and producer of the Caixin-Sinica Business Brief podcast.", "description": "The fallout from the political spat between the U.S. National Basketball Association and China is worsening, as more Chinese brands are pulling sponsorships...", "authors": ["Tanner Brown"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS775_ap_roc_ZG_20191007093536.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
