REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nTrump unleashed a fresh barrage of harsh comments on Beijing's trade practices on Tuesday, denting optimism around Sino-U.S. proposed talks and hurting internationally-focussed financials, oil majors (RDSa.L) (BP.L) and miners, pushing the main index .FTSE down 0.8%.\n\nIf losses hold, the index is headed for its biggest one-day drop since late August.\n\nThe FTSE 250 .FTMC also shed 0.8% by 0803 GMT as more investors focused on the future course of Brexit, with the House of Commons set to reconvene after the Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday Prime Minister Boris Johnson had suspended parliament unlawfully.\n\n\u201cCalls for resignation grow.
