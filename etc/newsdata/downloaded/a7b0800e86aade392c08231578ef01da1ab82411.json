This is a children's park! Stop!'\n\nShe tries to push one of girls off the swing, before the group insists they are still young enough to be playing on the equipment.\n\n'No, you're f**king not!' the woman shouts back.\n\n'You're not a f**king child \u2013 13 or younger!' she continues.\n\nThe woman then claims she's a police officer, before she demands: 'Get the f**k out of here now if you're not here to play as a child. Read the f**king sign!'\n\nA woman was caught on camera hurling a series of profanities at a group of Hispanic teens playing in a Texas park - before she then harassed several parents in a separate section of the play area\n\nThe verbal attack doesn't appear to be racially motivated, as the woman was later filmed harassing parents in a separate section of Dream Park.\n\nIn the second video, 'Swing Set Susan' appears to push in front of other parents in order to have her child use the play equipment.\n\n'A sign over there says you can't be over the age of six, is your daughter over the age of six?' she aggressively yells at another mother who takes issue with the fact she has cut the line.\n\n'She's seven,' the woman replies.\n\n'So... she's over the age of six!' 'Swing Set Susan' snaps back, before she sensationally declares that she 'owns' the park.\n\nOne of the teens captured the encounter and posted the video to Twitter, where it has already been viewed more than 4.6 million times\n\nHowever, contrary to the woman's claims, The Star Telegram reports Dream Park is an 'inclusive park that accommodates children of all ages regardless of physical or mental challenges' and was completed with '$3.1 million of privately raised funds'.\n\nHowever, she is soon left red-faced when other parents inform her that the sign says the play equipment is for children aged between five and 12.\n\n'So you built the park, you own it, and you don't know the age range?' one parent then sarcastically asks.\n\n'Yeah... um, maybe I don't. Maybe I need to be more advice,' she stammers nonsensically before wandering off.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dallas Forth Worth Police Department later released a statement refuting the woman's claim that she was an officer.\n\nThey also took to Twitter saying they were looking to track down the woman on potential criminal charges of Impersonating a Public Servant and Disorderly Conduct.\n\nShe has not been publicly named.\n\nDream Park is an 'inclusive park that accommodates children of all ages regardless of physical or mental challenges' and was completed with '$3.1 million of privately raised funds'", "description": "The incident occurred at Dream Park in downtown Forth Worth on Wednesday, when the woman approached the group claiming they were too old to be playing on a swing-set.", "authors": ["Andrew Court For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/19/19896762-0-image-a-35_1571421611524.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
