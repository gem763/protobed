Throughout this, I know that whatever we do might be perceived as not being enough, but I think we\u2019ve made a major statement.\n\n\u2018I think we\u2019ve made a major statement with the way we played, through such difficult circumstances. I don\u2019t think a game of this magnitude has ever been stopped twice.\n\n\u2018And, in the second half, although I hear that other things were going on, none of us on the pitch or at the side were aware of anything else going on, so the most important thing for me was that we got in at half-time.\n\n\u2018I discussed with all of the players and the substitutes that everybody was on-board. We knew that if anything happened in the second half, we were off.\n\nSouthgate backed his players\u2019 decision to finish the game, saying they had made a statement\n\n\u2018The referee had said the same and we knew that if we came off, we probably wouldn\u2019t be coming back on.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019ve talked to the players at the end, I think they still feel that they\u2019ve been able to make a statement but they also, naturally, because they want to be recognised for their football, they were playing so well that they didn\u2019t want to leave the pitch at that moment, as well.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure that will have been part of their thinking. So, I\u2019m incredibly proud of all of the players and all of the staff.\n\n\u2018We could be criticised for not going far enough but I think we\u2019ve made a huge statement and frankly, we were in an impossible situation to get it right to the satisfaction of everybody.\n\n\u2018Sadly, my players, because of their experiences in our own country, are hardened to racism. I don\u2019t know what that says about our society but that\u2019s the reality, so that actually saddens me that when I speak to them about it, they are absolutely hardened to it.\n\n\u2018So, they actually are in the dressing room smiling because they\u2019ve played so well. They also know they\u2019ve made a statement and they want the focus to be on the football. We will recognise there\u2019s been an opportunity tonight to raise awareness of this issue. I think that has happened.\n\n\u2018They shouldn\u2019t have had to have experienced what they did, but the unity of the dressing room and all of the staff and players (shone through). Sometimes you have to smile through adversity.\u2019\n\nFA chairman Greg Clarke also slammed the behaviour and insisted it would be investigated\n\nSpeaking immediately after the game, Football Association chairman Greg Clarke said: \u2018What a disappointing night. I mean it\u2019s probably one of the most appalling nights I\u2019ve seen in football.\n\n\u2018Gareth talked to the players at half time and they got together and they said, \u201cNo, we want to play, we want to finish, we want to win the game, we don\u2019t want the racists to win!\u201d\n\n\u2018I heard examples of appalling racist chanting. I was looking at a group of people, plaid in all black - about 50 of them - who were making what looked like political fascist gestures.\u2019\n\nReferee Ivan Bebek initiated UEFA's protocols and spoke to England captain Harry Kane\n\nThe FA now expect UEFA to open an investigation, with representatives from English football\u2019s governing body taking statements from members of the team and staff ahead of submitting their report of Monday's shocking events.\n\nEngland instigated step one of UEFA\u2019s three point protocol in the event of racism in the stadium during a match after Tyrone Mings, on his international debut, complained to linesman Bojan Zobenica that he\u2019d been abused in the 22nd minute.\n\nThe information was relayed to fourth official Mario Zebec who, after a conversation with Southgate, informed referee Ivan Bebek - which triggered the first step of UEFA\u2019s protocol in the 27th minute.\n\nBebek then had separate discussions with England captain Harry Kane and Bulgaria skipper Ivelin Popov.\n\nAfter a short delay, the stadium announcer warned the game would be suspended or abandoned if the racist abuse continued - adherent to step one of UEFA\u2019s protocol.\n\nSupporters could be seen making offensive gestures and also made monkey chants\n\nDespite the warnings, eye witnesses insist the abuse continued; with monkey chants heard whenever Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford were on the ball. Home fans were also seen making Nazi salutes.\n\nThree minutes before half-time the game was stopped yet again after further discussions between Southgate and fourth official Zebec.\n\nEngland\u2019s players were clearly incensed at the taunts players, vice-captain Jordan Henderson even having a blazing row with Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov.\n\nClarke was locked in conversation with Southgate about the shocking scenes just before half-time.\n\nThe expectancy at this point was for the second step of UEFA\u2019s protocol - for the referee to lead the players off and suspended the game - to be initiated but proceedings continued until half-time.\n\nThe end of the first half brought further controversy after home skipper Popov approached a group of supporters to have a long conversation. However, it is understood no Bulgarian players apologised to their English counterparts after the game.\n\nThe second half started as normal, but by this point a large number of Bulgarians had left the stadium as England strolled to victory.\n\nTyrone Mings (centre) was the subject of the racist chanting on his international debut\n\nMings, who said he\u2019d heard taunts during the warm-up, speaking to Radio 5 Live: \u2018It was a great night for me personally. It was a really proud moment in my career. I hope everyone enjoys this moment and it isn't overshadowed.\n\n\u2018I am proud of how we dealt with it and took the appropriate steps. I could hear it as clear as day. It doesn't affect me too much. I feel more sorry for those people who feel they have to have those opinions.\n\n\u2018I am very proud of everyone for the decisions we made. I went to Harry Kane first. He spoke to the manager, who then spoke to the fourth officials.\n\n\u2018Everyone was aware of it but we ultimately let our football do the talking and didn't get distracted by anything.\n\nEngland players - Sterling and Rashford among them - took to Twitter to condemn the racists.\n\nSterling wrote: \u2018Feeling sorry for Bulgaria to be represented by such idiots in their stadium.\n\n\u2018Anyway.. 6-0 and we go back home, at least we did our job. Safe travel to our fans, u guys did well.\u2019\n\nBulgaria head coach Krasimir Balakov said: \u2018I was concentrating and I didn\u2019t hear anything but if this proven to be true we should be ashamed and should apologise.\n\n\u2018This is an extremely sensitive and serious topic, if true this is a big shame.\u2019", "description": "SAMI MOKBEL AT VASIL LEVSKI STADIUM: Gareth Southgate admitted he came close to leading his team off the field as England took a proud stand against racism in Sofia. .", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/22/19712400-0-image-a-63_1571089789912.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
