REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - The former chief business officer of U.S. biotechnology company Osiris Therapeutics Inc has agreed to pay a $40,000 civil penalty for lying to auditors, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday.\n\nThe SEC had alleged that Bobby Dwayne Montgomery prompted Osiris to book fake revenue and give false information to auditors. Montgomery agreed to a judgment that enjoins him from future violations of securities law, the SEC said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur client is pleased to have resolved this matter on a no-admit no-deny basis, and looks forward to moving on with his life,\u201d said Stephen Crimmins, Montgomery\u2019s lawyer.\n\nThe biotech firm previously paid a $1.5 million penalty to settle charges of overstating company performance and issuing fraudulent financial statements for nearly two years, the regulator said.\n\nThe SEC said it last month dismissed charges against one of Osiris\u2019s former chief financial officers, Gregory I. Law. Litigation against two other executives is ongoing, the agency said.\n\n\u201cThe SEC deserves credit for belatedly recognizing that Greg is innocent, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he shouldn\u2019t have been charged to begin with,\u201d said Aitan Goelman, counsel for Law.", "description": "The former chief business officer of U.S. biotechnology company Osiris Therapeutics Inc has agreed to pay a $40,000 civil penalty for lying to auditors, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442048245&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G274", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
