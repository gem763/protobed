These two satellite images, captured 24 hours apart, show this. A star marks one particular location. (NOAA/RAMMB/Matthew Cappucci/The Washington Post)\n\nGrand Bahama Island may have just endured the longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed.\n\nThe eyewall, the most severe part of a hurricane, bombarded Grand Bahama Island for a horrifying 40 hours straight. After an onslaught that began at 8:08 p.m. Sunday night, Dorian finally began to pull away from the beleaguered archipelago around 2 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nFor 15 of those 40 hours, Dorian was a Category 5 hurricane \u2014 the slowest-moving Category 5 storm on record in the North Atlantic Basin.\n\nMost hurricanes of Dorian\u2019s strength move at a forward speed of about 10 to 15 mph. Dorian crawled along at 1.3 mph \u2014 less than half of a typical human walking pace. At times, the hurricane was stationary.\n\nGreat Abaco Island, a slender north-south oriented island to the east of Grand Bahama, first took the brunt of Dorian\u2019s Category 5 impact Sunday. Though Great Abaco is only about 10 miles wide where Dorian crossed, the storm rode northwest parallel to the island. That meant the eyewall was in contact with Great Abaco for a whopping 8 hours 22 minutes based on conservative radar estimates.\n\nAt that time, the National Hurricane Center issued several dire statements, warning of the potential for 220 mph wind gusts and an 18- to 23-foot ongoing storm surge, which is the storm-driven rise in ocean water above normally dry land. At that point, Dorian was moving west at 5 mph.\n\nThirty-six hour nightmare on Grand Bahama.\n\n\n\nSome portion of Grand Bahama spent a day & a half in the most intense parts of Hurricane Dorian. pic.twitter.com/om2JpBLVob \u2014 Dakota Smith (@weatherdak) September 3, 2019\n\nBy the time the Category 5 monster arrived on Grand Bahama, it had slowed to a crawl. According to Philip Klotzbach, a hurricane specialist and researcher at Colorado State University, Dorian was the strongest Atlantic storm on record to venture so far north. It also tied for the dubious title of strongest hurricane wind speed at landfall in the North Atlantic Ocean Basin since records began in the late 1800s.\n\nThink back to the devastation associated with Hurricane Michael in October 2018. That storm\u2019s eyewall probably spun over any given area for about two hours. Now add 20 mph to the already Category 5 winds, an extra nine or 10 feet of storm surge, and hold the storm still for more than 36 hours. It\u2019s simply unimaginable.\n\nUpon reviewing radar data, it appears that Pelican Point on Grand Bahama Island, on the eastern side of the island, experienced an endless 25 hours and 22 minutes (give or take a few minutes) in the eyewall. During five of those hours, the storm had winds of Category 5 intensity; Dorian was a major hurricane throughout the remaining 19 plus hours.\n\nPelican Point is not a highly populated community; in fact, it\u2019s on a rural part of the island with only two dozen or fewer homes. Those residents probably endured a period of weather unlike anything in memory.\n\n\u201cA Cat 5 just stopping dead in its tracks over land, no, can\u2019t think of any,\u201d wrote Brian McNoldy, CWG\u2019s tropical weather expert.\n\nPelican Point then saw a lull of about eight hours, during which point it was nestled in Dorian\u2019s eye. This occurred between 12:21 a.m. and 8:25 a.m. Monday, when the eyewall returned with a vengeance as Dorian engaged the parking brake.\n\nThis is one of the worst hit spots in #MarshHarbour Locals say it's called the \"Mud\" and that it has a large population of Hatian immigrants. Hopefully they evacuated to a shelter bc the damage is catastrophic there. #TheBahamas @accuweather @breakingweather pic.twitter.com/GxsaLU4sAI \u2014 Jonathan Petramala (@jpetramala) September 3, 2019\n\nCan you imagine sleeping in the dead of night beneath partly cloudy skies and nearly calm winds, knowing that, within 10 or 15 miles in all directions, you were entirely surrounded by a ring of 175-plus mph fury? It\u2019s simply unfathomable.\n\n[Here\u2019s what it looked like inside the eye of Hurricane Dorian]\n\nIf you think that\u2019s berserk, try this stat: Halls Point on Grand Bahama was in the eye for 11 hours and 43 minutes. From just before 6 a.m. Monday to 5:30 p.m., the tip of Halls Point was engulfed in Dorian\u2019s cylindrical void.\n\nAt times, the eyewall lurked a mile or less away. Imagine being able to outwalk the eyewall. Of course, this would have been impossible \u2014 because the tornado-like wind speeds were accompanied by 18 to 23 feet of storm surge. For about an hour, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday, Halls Point straddled this boundary, irregularities in the eyewall\u2019s wobbly edge thrusting Halls Point in and out of extreme conditions.\n\nFreeport, a community of about 27,000, narrowly missed the worst of the winds in the inner eyewall. In fact, radar data shows that Freeport didn\u2019t actually make it into the eyewall. However, continuous onshore 100 mph winds stubbornly pushed an extreme surge ashore, probably causing significant damage in the popular vacation destination.\n\nHurricane Update: Iram Lewis,\n\nMember of Parliament,\n\nCentral Grand Bahama sent me this video of Freeport International Airport: FPO pic.twitter.com/oDPIJXBnP9 \u2014 Dem House Leader (@kionnemcghee) September 2, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon that tropical storms and hurricanes stall out. In fact, that\u2019s relatively common, because these storms are steered by larger weather features that can sometimes be absent. But most of them at least move a little, and very few don\u2019t stand still for this long, especially when they\u2019re this strong.\n\nThe powerful circulation of a high-end hurricane usually interacts some with its environment even if the background airflow is weak, spurring some movement. But Dorian was a different sort of beast.\n\nKlotzbach wrote that Dorian only tracked 25 miles in 24 hours; that would make it the slowest-moving Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record.", "description": "Grand Bahama Island may have just endured the longest siege of violent and destructive weather ever observed.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "September At Pm", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
