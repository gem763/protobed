She has no governance ability \u2026 she is not suitable to be chief executive\u201d\n\nSecurity was very tight ahead of Lam's third policy address, with riot police stationed outside and water cannon on standby.\n\nShe was speaking hours after the U.S. House of Representatives passed three pieces of legislation related to the Hong Kong protests, drawing a swift rebuke from Beijing, which accused the lawmakers of \"sinister intentions\" of undermining stability in the Asian financial hub.\n\nOne of the measures, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to keep receiving the special treatment that has allowed it to be a major financial center.\n\nLam has ruled out making any concessions to the protesters in the face of escalating unrest, saying, \"Violence would only breed more violence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting By Donny Kwok, Clare Jim, Sarah Wu, Twinnie Siu, Farah Master, James Pomfret and Jessie Pang; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "description": "Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced measures aimed at easing a housing shortage on Wednesday as she battles to restore confidence in her administration and address widespread discontent after four months of anti-government protests.
