(AP) - Ben DiNucci accounted for two touchdowns, Jawon Hamilton capped the scoring with a 3-yard run on the first possession of overtime, and James Madison beat Stony Brook 45-38 on Saturday night in a battle of two top teams in the Football Championship Subdivision.\n\nHamilton, who also had a 55-yard TD run in the first quarter, finished with 13 carries for 105 yards. DiNucci was 13-of-17 passing for 218 yards and a score and added 16 carries for 80 yards and a TD.\n\nOn the first play of OT, DiNucci hit Riley Stapleton for a 20-yard gain to set up Hamilton\u2019s eventual winning TD.\n\nPercy Agyei-Obese\u2019s 24-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter gave James Madison (5-1, 2-0 Colonial Athletic Association) a 38-28 lead.\n\nStony Brook then went three-and-out and James Madison quickly marched downfield before Gavin Heslop forced, and recovered, a fumble by Agyei-Obese at the 3. The Seawolves ripped off an eight-play, 97-yard drive capped by Ty Son Lawton\u2019s 1-yard TD run to trim their deficit to 38-35 with 7:20 to play.\n\nDiNucci converted three third downs - including a 7-yard run on third-and-6 - as the JMU offense took more than 5\u00bd minutes off the clock before punting. Tyquell Fields hit Jean Constant for a 20-yard gain on fourth-and-14 and, two plays later, his 21-yard pass to Peter McKenzie set up Nick Courtney\u2019s 47-yard field goal that tied it with five seconds left in regulation.\n\nFields finished with 318 yards passing and two scores and Lawton had 108 yards rushing and three TDs for Stony Brook (4-1, 1-1).\n\nJames Madison, which went into the game ranked No. 2 in the FCS Coaches poll, has won five in a row since a season-opening 20-13 loss to West Virginia.\n\nThe No. 24 Seawolves, who had their three-game win streak snapped, have lost five in a row against JMU.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ben DiNucci accounted for two touchdowns, Jawon Hamilton capped the scoring with a 3-yard run on the first possession of overtime, and James Madison beat Stony Brook 45-38 on Saturday night in a battle of two top teams in the Football Championship Subdivision.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
