At age 47, after 25 years of running agents in Eastern Europe, Nat is about to be put out to pasture. A final foray running a ragtag houseful of Russia watchers in London leads to the surprise unearthing of separate cunning, ultra-secret plans by two world powers to bust up Europe. One of the two bad actors is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia, and let\u2019s just say the other one is not Argentina.\n\nAs usual, the characters le Carr\u00e9 respects, like Nat and his human-rights lawyer wife Prue, are lovingly examined in all their complexities, while his villains (Putin, Trump) are just as lovingly eviscerated. Nat and Prue\u2019s marriage has been emotionally off-again, on-again; they bonded best when they were both young agents working for \u201cthe Office,\u201d as it\u2019s called, in Moscow and currently while dealing with their rebellious college-age daughter, Stephanie. The best thing about le Carr\u00e9\u2019s otherwise not-always-convincing narrative is the way Nat and Prue regain their marital mojo when they join operational forces for maybe one last time for the good of humankind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn unlikely coincidence in the novel does produce another marvelous character: Pushy, opinionated Ed Shannon, half Nat\u2019s age, shows up one fine day at the badminton club where Nat is a champ. The two become regular friendly competitors. Both are vague about who their employers are, but it\u2019s Ed who rants about current affairs despite a sign over the bar that reads \u201cNo Brexit Talk Aloud.\u201d Ed, a Germanophile, despises both the Brexiteers and Trump; the American president, he avers, \u201cis presiding over the systematic no-holds-barred Nazification of the United States.\u201d In the opening line of the novel, Nat tells us that his meeting with Ed was \u201cnot contrived,\u201d although it will turn out that Ed will come to play a critical role in what Nat sometimes refers to as \u201cthe Fall.\u201d\n\nOver the years, so many of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s intel-service characters have been torn as they\u2019re called to perform immoral acts for ends sometimes involving a sliding scale of morality. Filling this role in \u201cAgent Running in the Field\u201d is a talented young probationer named Florence who quits the service, telling Nat she is sick of lying. Suspicious, Nat asks their sometimes duplicitous supervisor Dominic Trench why Florence resigned \u2014 \u201ca pretty massive decision if lying for your country is your chosen profession.\u201d The answer is not simple.\n\nThe character most emblematic of the rot spread by Putin\u2019s Russia is Arkady, a former agent of Nat\u2019s back in the early post-Soviet era. Arkady once dreamed of a post-Stalinist liberal democracy in Russia. Now, he believes all that is lost. Instead, he has become a cynical rich oligarch with a villa and bodyguards in a Czech resort town. When Nat approaches him for information about a Russian spying scheme, Arkady explains to his old handler that \u201cI love best my Karlovy Vary. We have an Orthodox cathedral. Pious Russian crooks worship in it once a week. When I am dead I shall join them. I have a trophy wife, very young. . . . What more should I want from life?\u201d Maybe because Arkady really wants a little more than the items on that list, he helps Nat out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly all of le Carr\u00e9\u2019s characters in \u201cAgent Running in the Field,\u201d however confused or misguided they are, have a few redeeming characteristics. But two characters have none. In a memorable scene, Nat peers up at a television set and sees Trump and Putin in Helsinki. \u201cTrump, speaking as if to order, is disowning the findings of his own intelligence services, which have come up with the inconvenient truth that Russia interfered in the 2016 American presidential election. Putin smiles his proud jailer\u2019s smile.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising that in a recent interview with the BBC, le Carr\u00e9 (who turns 88 on Oct. 19) said \u201cit would be impossible to write at the moment without speaking from within the state of the nation \u2014 we\u2019re part of it, I\u2019m part of it. . . . I\u2019m depressed by it. I\u2019m ashamed of it and that I think communicates itself in the book.\u201d It does.\n\nRichard Lipez writes the Don Strachey private eye novels under the name Richard Stevenson.\n\nAGENT RUNNING IN THE FIELD\n\nBy John le Carr\u00e9\n\nViking. 281 pp. $29\n\nAD", "description": "\u2018Agent Running in the Field\u2019 feels as urgent as a news alert.", "authors": ["Richard Lipez"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/uE6aCDG8w63Bb_CtXOSg9s20igY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDGNFRHOXUI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
