The Los Angeles Police Department initially opened up an investigation into the matter last month, but it's since closed the case, according to BuzzFeed. The LAPD would only tell Business Insider on Tuesday afternoon that it was \"aware of the matter\" pertaining to Houts and her dog.\n\nLast month, Houts made headlines after she accidentally uploaded an unedited video to her YouTube channel featuring her Doberman dog named Sphinx. In the video, Houts is seen on at least three separate occasions screaming at and smacking her dog after he playfully jumps up on her while she's trying to film the YouTube video.\n\nRead more: The YouTuber who accidentally uploaded raw footage showing her hitting her pet dog is being investigated by the police\n\nSoon after the video was widely shared online, LAPD told Business Insider that its animal-cruelty task force was aware of the situation with Houts and was \"looking into the matter.\" But a police spokesperson told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that it had decided not to press charges.\n\n\"Animal Task Force looked into the matter \u2014 obviously they saw the video the public had seen,\" police told BuzzFeed News. \"They determined it didn't rise to the level of animal cruelty.\"\n\nThe video in question was quickly deleted from YouTube, but others were quick to upload their own versions, and Houts was subsequently reamed online.\n\nIn one clip from the video, the dog jumps on Houts while she's filming for the video. In turn, Houts holds down the dog, yells \"stop\" at him, and appears to spit on him just out of frame of the camera \u2014 although Houts has said she didn't do that.\n\nIn the days of backlash, Houts issued an apology on Twitter to \"anyone who has been effected [sic] negatively by the footage.\" In an extensive statement written in the iPhone Notes app, Houts wrote that she had been having a \"less than exceptional\" week and said she was showing him \"as a dog parent\" that his behavior was unacceptable.", "description": "The Los Angeles Police Department told BuzzFeed that the video of Brooke Houts and her dog \"didn't rise to the level of animal cruelty.\"", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6eceb62e22af1ce417921b-1536-768.jpg"}
