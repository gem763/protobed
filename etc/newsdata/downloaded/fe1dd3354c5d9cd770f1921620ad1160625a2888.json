USA TODAY\n\nWith the top three teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference having open dates last week, there wasn\u2019t much movement in the latest league power rankings, at least among the upper echelon.\n\nSurprising upsets by Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech and Louisville created some movement below -- particularly for Pittsburgh, which suddenly appears to be a contender again in the league\u2019s Coastal Division after winning three straight games by a combined seven points.\n\n1. Clemson (5-0, 3-0 ACC)\n\nLast week: 1\n\nThe reigning national champs have a couple of impressive streaks they\u2019d like to continue this week against Atlantic Division rival Florida State. Clemson has won 20 consecutive games, which is the nation\u2019s longest active winning streak, and has defeated the Seminoles for four consecutive seasons, becoming the first ACC team to do that. Expect both streaks to continue as the Tigers return to action following an open date.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Florida State, 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC.\n\nPOWER RANKINGS: ACC | Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 | SEC\n\nRE-RANK: Ohio State takes over as the latest No. 1 in NCAA Re-Rank 1-130\n\nWINNERS AND LOSERS: Highs and lows from Week 6 in college football\n\n2. Wake Forest (5-0, 1-0)\n\nLast week: 2\n\nAre Wake Forest and Clemson headed for an Atlantic Division showdown in mid-November? Could be. The Demon Deacons get three of their next four opponents at home, and those four are a combined 4-5 in ACC play.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Louisville, 7:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n3. Virginia (4-1, 2-0)\n\nLast week: 3\n\nVirginia is bidding to become the seventh different Coastal Division champion in as many years. The Cavaliers will take another big step toward that goal with a win at Miami.\n\nUp next: Friday at Miami (Fla.), 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\n4. North Carolina (3-3, 2-1)\n\nLast week: 4\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s rebirth under Mack Brown continued last week with a win at Georgia Tech that ended plenty of futility in Atlanta; the Tar Heels had lost in nine of their past 10 trips to Bobby Dodd Stadium. Rookie QB Sam Howell continued his progression by passing for a career-high 376 yards with four touchdowns.\n\nUp next: Oct. 19 at Virginia Tech.\n\n5. Florida State (3-2, 2-1)\n\nLast week: 7\n\nDon\u2019t look now, but the Seminoles have won three of four and get a shot at No. 2 Clemson this week. Florida State has lost four in a row against Clemson, but this year\u2019s edition appears to be better equipped than the 2018 team that was shelled 59-10 by the Tigers.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 1 Clemson, 3:30 p.m., ABC\n\n6. Pittsburgh (4-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week: 8\n\nJust when one assumes that the Panthers are dead and buried, they come to life with an unexpected victory. The latest came last week at Duke, where Pitt blew a 23-point lead, then scored the winning touchdown with 38 seconds left to top the Blue Devils for the fifth consecutive time. Even better news for Coach Pat Narduzzi\u2019s team? None of the Panthers\u2019 six remaining opponents are better than 3-2.\n\nUp next: Oct. 18 at Syracuse.\n\nPittsburgh quarterback Kenny Pickett runs with the ball during the first half against Duke at Wallace Wade Stadium.

Syracuse (3-2, 0-1)\n\nLast week: 6\n\nFollowing an open date, Syracuse returns with a Thursday night game at North Carolina State, where unpredictability abounds. The Wolfpack have won four of the past five games against Syracuse, but each have been wild, high-scoring affairs. Expect more of the same.\n\nUp next: Thursday at North Carolina State, 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\n8. Duke (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week: 5\n\nDuke just can\u2019t get over the hump. The Blue Devils turned the ball over six times and were unable to overcome Pittsburgh last week, coming out on the short end of a 33-30 verdict. Duke will get back on track Saturday thanks to a trip to Georgia Tech next on the schedule.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Georgia Tech, 12:30 p.m., Raycom Sports Network.\n\n9. Virginia Tech (3-2, 1-2)\n\nLast week: 12\n\nThe Hokies were two-touchdown underdogs at Miami last week, then promptly walked away with a 42-35 victory that may help keep the program\u2019s 26-year bowl streak alive. It was pretty after blowing a 28-point lead, but it was a win needed by coach Justin Fuente.\n\nUp next: Saturday vs. Rhode Island, 4 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n10. North Carolina State (3-2, 0-1)\n\nLast week: 11\n\nAnother team hoping to extend a bowl streak is North Carolina State, which has enjoyed a postseason trip in each of Coach Dave Doeren\u2019s past five seasons. If that streak is to be extended, the Wolfpack need a victory Thursday night vs. Syracuse, but that may be easier said than done for a team that is still in search of a reliable quarterback.\n\nUp next: Thursday vs. Syracuse, 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\n11. Louisville (3-2, 1-1)\n\nLast week: 13\n\nLouisville continues to make strides under first-year coach Scott Satterfield. The Cardinals snapped a nine-game losing streak in ACC play last week with a 41-39 win against Boston College in which freshman running back Javian Hawkins had 172 yards.\n\nUp next: Saturday at No. 17 Wake Forest, 7:30 p.m., ACC Network.\n\n12. Boston College (3-3, 1-2)\n\nLast week: 9\n\nBoston College, which traditionally has prided itself on a stout defense, was humbled at Louisville last week, surrendering 664 yards. To add insult to injury, quite literally, quarterback Anthony Brown suffered a knee injury early in the game and his future status is uncertain. Good news? BC has a bye week before hosting North Carolina State.\n\nUp next: Oct. 19 vs. North Carolina State.\n\n13. Miami (Fla.) (2-3, 0-2)\n\nLast week: 10\n\nRemember when the Hurricanes\u2019 move to the ACC was going to bolster the league\u2019s football profile? Suffice to say Miami has had more impact on the league in basketball. Last week Miami outgained Virginia Tech by 226 yards and had 10 more first downs yet somehow found a way to lose, matching the Hurricanes' worst start since the 2011 season when tjeu finished 6-6.\n\nUp next: Friday vs. No. 19 Virginia, 8 p.m., ESPN.\n\n14. Georgia Tech (1-4, 0-2)\n\nLast week: 14\n\nThe ACC\u2019s lowest-scoring team and most porous defense lived up to its billing again last week in a 38-22 loss to North Carolina. It\u2019s not likely to get better this week when the Yellow Jackets travel to Duke.\n\nUp next: Saturday at Duke, 12:30 p.m., Raycom Sports Network.", "description": "Clemson still leads the latest ACC power rankings in college football.
