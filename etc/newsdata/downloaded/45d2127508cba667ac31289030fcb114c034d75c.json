REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir\n\nWhile the protests were not big - Lebanon\u2019s divisions make large demonstrations rare - they erupted from Beirut to the Bekaa Valley and from Sidon in the south to Tripoli in the north.\n\nIn Tripoli, protesters took aim at prime ministers past and present, all Sunni Muslims under Lebanon\u2019s ruling conventions. In remote Brital, a flag of the powerful Shi\u2019ite group Hezbollah was torn down. In Beirut, they chanted against all leaders, including the Shi\u2019ite parliament speaker, Christian head of state and Sunni premier.\n\nLebanese leaders have said little about Sunday\u2019s protests. For the coalition government led by Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, the focus remains reviving the economy through long-delayed reforms, such as fixing the power sector that bleeds public funds while failing to meet Lebanon\u2019s power needs.\n\nIn the process, Lebanon hopes for an international seal of approval that will unlock billions in finance for investment.\n\nBut Jalal Salma, who protested in Tripoli on Sunday, has more immediate worries. \u201cThere is real hunger and we can\u2019t see a solution on the horizon. On the contrary, we see a dark future ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economic problems have been building for years.\n\nShattered by war between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon has one of the world\u2019s highest debt burdens as a share of its economy. Economic growth has been hit by regional conflict and instability. Unemployment for the under 35s runs at 37%.\n\nThe balance of payments has been negative for years, meaning more money leaves the country than enters it. This financial crunch has added to the impetus for reform.\n\nForeign allies are not yet fully convinced by the pace of change. Some $11 billion pledged 18 months ago in France, conditional on reform, has yet to flow into the economy.\n\n\u201cWe stressed the importance of delivering on reforms rather than announcing reforms, and of delivering the 2020 budget on time,\u201d Philippe Lazzarini, a top U.N. official in Lebanon, said on Tuesday after meeting Hariri.\n\n\u201cCARVING UP THE CAKE\u201d\n\nThe kind of steps needed to fix the national finances have long proven elusive. Sectarian politicians, many of them civil war veterans, have long used state resources for their own political benefit and are reluctant to cede prerogatives.\n\nMany of them are millionaires. Some are billionaires.\n\nLebanon ranked 138 of 180 countries in Transparency International\u2019s 2018 corruption perceptions index.\n\n\u201cThe politicians have always been in conflict on how to carve up the cake. This obstructs any reforms and reveals them as a bunch of liars to international opinion,\u201d said Mahmoud Faqih, a veteran campaigner who protested in Beirut.\n\n\u201cThe wide scope of these protests is evidence of the buildup of the crisis and that it is rubbing salt in the citizens\u2019 wounds,\u201d said Faqih, 35, a journalist.\n\nPublic concerns have been intensified by the emergence of a black market where dollars cost more than the pegged exchange rate. The central bank introduced new steps on Tuesday to organize the provision of dollars for key imports.\n\nThe government has vowed to maintain the peg.\n\nMaha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center, said concern over the currency had \u201cbecome a daily topic of conversation\u201d and Sunday\u2019s protests reflected that.\n\n\u201cWhat is very frustrating for many is that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a horizon. It\u2019s not like we have a plan - that we can grit our teeth and bear it for the next six months - and everything will be okay,\u201d she said.\n\nMORE URGENCY SEEN\n\nThe government has won some praise for efforts to reduce this year\u2019s deficit and its plan to fix the power sector - moves the IMF called \u201cvery welcome first steps on a long road\u201d.\n\nThe 2019 budget included politically difficult moves, notably a three-year state hiring freeze. But proposals for a temporary public sector pay cut were torpedoed.\n\nKnowing more must be done, politicians aim to further cut the deficit in the 2020 budget but without raising new taxes.\n\n\u201cObviously the speed at which decisions are being made is not very promising, and the government and the political parties have to move much faster,\u201d Nadim Munla, Hariri\u2019s senior adviser, told Reuters. But \u201cwe have noticed that in the last few weeks that there is convergence on the urgency to move forward.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Monday, he also expressed hope that upcoming trips by Hariri to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia would yield \u201csomething concrete\u201d after \u201cencouraging signs\u201d of a Gulf Arab readiness to deposit funds in Lebanon.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nA recent trip by Hariri to France had also been a success, he said, citing agreement on a donor state follow-up mechanism for Lebanon, the scheduling of a high-level meeting next month, and French investment interest.\n\nMP Alain Aoun of the Christian Free Patriotic Movement said the budget was a new test \u201cfor the government and parliament to prove they have the ability\u201d to take Lebanon out of the crisis.\n\n\u201cPeople have the right to protest and no one should blame them for that. Rather than looking for excuses, the political class has to take the necessary courageous measures and reforms to restore confidence that it lost in the public opinion and in the international community,\u201d he told Reuters.", "description": "In a country fractured along sectarian lines, the unusually wide geographic reach of protests over Lebanon's dire economy on Sunday suggests deepening anger with an entire class of politicians who have jointly led it into crisis.", "authors": ["Tom Perry", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436578307&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920MB"}
