Craig took over the individual client-focused investor-services business and marketing responsibilities from Terri Kallsen and Andy Gill when the two exited in July as part of a reorganization.\n\nChris Thom, a senior vice president in Charles Schwab's planning and portfolio group and the president of the Schwab Private Client investment-advice service, has left, along with Jennifer Fedora, who worked with the company's retail leadership team as senior vice president of investor-services field enablement, Business Insider has learned. Toby Roberts, a managing director focused on Schwab's retail mobile app, has also exited.\n\nThom and Fedora were based in Colorado, and Roberts was based in Chicago.\n\nOn Tuesday, Business Insider reported that a prominent markets and sector analyst had also left Schwab in recent days.\n\nRead more: Charles Schwab's retail head and marketing chief are out \u2014 and the firm's still figuring out what's next\n\nSchwab plans to lay off around 600 staffers, or 3% of its workforce, it said in a statement on Monday. Those job cuts were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSchwab's $1.8 billion acquisition of USAA's brokerage business is set to close next year, handing Schwab both brokerage and managed accounts. An August rate cut by the Federal Reserve is meanwhile piling pressure on Schwab, which rakes in a portion of its revenues from interest on client cash in sweep accounts.\n\nThe Charles Schwab spokeswoman Mayura Hooper declined to comment on personnel matters. Multiple requests for comment to Thom and Roberts were not returned. Fedora declined to comment. The website RIABiz first reported Thom's exit.\n\nSchwab for decades has touted itself as a discount brokerage for the Main Street investor and also enjoyed an ascent as an established player in wealth management. The firm, based in San Francisco, oversaw some $3.7 trillion in client assets at the end of August. That's a 5% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRead more: Charles Schwab is losing a prominent markets analyst as the discount broker gears up to cut 600 jobs\n\nExecutive departures\n\nBusiness Insider first reported in July that Kallsen, Schwab's former retail head, and Gill, the former chief marketing officer, departed as part of a restructuring, with Craig assuming leadership of those responsibilities while a new structure was determined.\n\nThom, the head of Schwab Private Client, joined the company in 2012, according to industry records. Thom led five teams around the country, according to his LinkedIn profile, and had previously served at USAA in wealth management and financial planning.\n\nFedora, who was with the firm for a decade and rose from a managing director to senior vice president of field enablement, was also heavily involved with Schwab's diversity and inclusion efforts. She led the firm's women's network, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\nRoberts, the managing director focused on Schwab's mobile application, was involved with the retail-client experience, according to his LinkedIn page. He was previously with Discover Financial Services in a similar role before joining Schwab in 2015.\n\nRead more: Brokerage Charles Schwab says to cut about 600 jobs\n\nThe company has meanwhile also dialed back overseas, with its Singapore office set to close at the end of this year, and its website is already informing investors of the change. Schwab's Australia office no longer provided services as of September 13.\n\nThe Singapore closure was first reported by Reuters and the news website Finews.asia, and the Australian publication Financial Standard first reported the Australian closure. Half a dozen people were employed in the Singapore office, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source.\n\nThose offices were small in terms of Schwab's overall business, but the closures marked a quick retreat in places where Schwab had only been present for a few years. Kallsen said on a call with investors in February that Schwab likely would not do much more overseas expansion, citing regulatory burdens.\n\nYou can contact this reporter at rungarino@businessinsider.com, or with secure communication methods available here.", "description": "The exits come as Charles Schwab is cutting some 600 jobs, or 3% of its workforce.
