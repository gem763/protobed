They've been...the number one country worldwide of terror between sponsoring terror and doing it themselves, and we can\u2019t have it,\u201d he said in the Oval Office.\n\nThe Trump administration pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal last year and has re-imposed waves of sanctions since then.
