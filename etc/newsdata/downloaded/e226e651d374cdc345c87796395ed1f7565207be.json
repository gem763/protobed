Harvey Weinstein: his accusers 1/42 Harvey Weinstein Harry Weinstein\u2019s reputation as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading executives was long cemented in stone. The acclaimed movie mogul, who produced Oscar-winning films Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, and The Artist, clocked up box office successes and accolades aplenty. But this has quickly changed since a chorus of women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment and assault. Since the New York Times\u2019 bombshell report disclosed sexual harassment and rape allegations against the film mogul dating back decades, Weinstein has been fired from his namesake company, expelled from the Oscars and has had his wife leave him. Weinstein has apologised for having \u201ccaused a lot of pain\u201d but has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Getty 2/42 Annabella Sciorra The Sopranos actor alleged Weinstein raped her after shooting The Night We Never Met, a 1993 movie that Weinstein produced. Similar to the stories told by other women, Weinstein drove the actor home, only to reportedly burst into Sciorra's apartment and start unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cHe shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me,\u201d Sciorra said. \u201cI kicked and I yelled.\u201d Weinstein then allegedly locked her arms and forced sexual intercourse on her. After the incident, Sciorra found it increasingly hard to get work, many filmmakers saying 'We heard you were difficult', something the actor claims was because of the 'Weinstein-machine'. Getty 3/42 Natassia Malthe The model and actress, who has appeared in around 50 films, said she met Weinstein at a BAFTA after party in 2008 while she was working as a spokeswoman for LG. She told a press conference in New York that she felt pressured into telling Weinstein she was staying at the Sanderson Hotel after being put on the spot. Malthe, now 43, said after her shift on February 10 she went back to her room and went to sleep, but was awoken by \"repeated pounding\" on her door, from someone yelling: \"Open the door Natassia Malthe, it's Harvey Weinstein.\" Feeling humiliated, she said she opened the door. She alleged Weinstein began implying sex would get her a role in an upcoming film while semi-undressed and then he began to masturbate. \"I was sitting on the bed talking to Harvey when he pushed me back and forced himself onto me. It was not consensual. He did not use a condom,\" she said. AP 4/42 Sean Young The actor, best known for her role in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, said that Weinstein exposed himself to her in the early 1990s, when she was starring in the Miramax-produced Love Crimes - a production company that Weinstein headed at the time. \"I personally experienced him pulling his you-know-what out of his pants to shock me,\" she said. \"My basic response was, 'You know, Harvey, I really don\u2019t think you should be pulling that thing out, it\u2019s not very pretty.'\" Young never worked with Weinstein again after the incident. 5/42 Mimi Haleyi Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child's bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s. She said she was aspiring to work in television and film production when she was first introduced to him at the London premiere of The Aviator around two years earlier and he helped her get experience on the set of a TV show being produced by The Weinstein Company. But, she added, he repeatedly hassled her and even tried to force himself through her front door in an effort to get her to join him on a trip to Paris. At one point he allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on an aspiring production assistant while she was on her period. Getty 6/42 Lupita Nyong'o In an op-ed for The New York Times, the Oscar-winning actor said she was invited to Weinstein\u2019s family home in Connecticut on the premise of watching a film shortly after they met in 2011.

The Kenyan-Mexican actress, now 34, said she felt pressured into giving him a massage after he offered her one. \"Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants,\" she wrote.\"I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable.

When she was initially invited to a meeting with Weinstein, Judd said, she was surprised to learn the producer was in his hotel room - a tactic that recurs in other womens\u2019 accounts. Echoing the accounts of other women, Judd said Weinstein suggested she give him a massage and then invited her to watch him shower.
