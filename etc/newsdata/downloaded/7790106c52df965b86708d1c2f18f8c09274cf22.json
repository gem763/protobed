Her behaviour was so controlling she sabotaged her own wedding.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Watching Don't Tell The Bride tonight has irritated me so much! The bride fully admitted to knowing his whereabouts 24/7, being controlling and having full access to his emails. If that was the other way round people would be telling her to get of the relationship.'\n\nFrom the outset of the show, Shanise admitted she was controlling, telling the camera: 'I do wear the trousers in the house. I give him what he can cope with, then I do the rest.'\n\nShe revealed that she always knows where her partner is and who he's with, saying: 'I always try to keep a record of what Yanise is doing and his whereabouts.\n\nViewers were stunned by Shanise's 'controlling' behaviour after it emerged she had been going through her fiance's emails and discovered the plans for the wedding\n\n'I feel my anxiety is going to go through the rooftops not knowing what Yanis is up to.'\n\nYanis planned to wed his bride in Paris before flying back to Birmingham for the reception - with their budget only stretching to pay for 13 guests to travel to the ceremony.\n\nThe groom decided that Shanise's ten-year-old brother Chris wasn't a priority guest and would only attend the reception.\n\nHowever, Yanis appeared to have a very sudden change of heart - leading the producers to initially become suspicious.\n\nShanise and her bridesmaids later admitted they knew details of the day as she had snooped through the groom's emails on an iPad\n\nThen, when bridesmaid Melissa was told that she no longer would be attending, she let slip that the flights were booked to Paris.\n\nThe bridal party knew they would be travelling abroad, but they were supposed to have no idea where they were going - leading the producers to conclude Yanis and Shanise had been communicating via email.\n\nThe bridesmaids later visited Yanis' house for what they thought was their dress fitting, however, they were stopped by producers mid-way through their chat.\n\nProducers were forced to confront the groom and told him they'd have to cancel the entire wedding for the first time in the show's history - as their 'secret was out.'\n\nThe show's producer said: 'Okay guys I'm going stop you there. We normally would do a bridesmaids reveal, but it's come to our attention that the secret appears to be out and the bridal party know about some of the plans for the wedding.'\n\nAfter asking Yanis how the pair were communicating, he confessed: 'Shanise got access to my iPad with my emails in there. So technically the bride wasn't told, she found out through email.'\n\nAfter storming off into the kitchen Yanis gathered himself and told Shanise the bad news on the phone, saying: 'It's not good...It's not going ahead.'\n\nThe distraught bride-to-be broke down in tears and was comforted by friend and bridesmaid, Melissa (pictured together)\n\nShanise, in disbelief, asked: 'What the hell - what happens now? I need to know - is there a wedding or not?'\n\nShe was then left in tears after being told by producers: 'I know this is difficult but the rules have been broken and we are going to have to cancel this wedding.'\n\nA week later, the couple reflected on their time on the show and confessed they were 'heartbroken' and had found it hard to 'cope' with the aftermath of breaking the rules.\n\nViewers were stunned by the history-making episode, with many taking to Twitter to discuss Shanise's behaviour.\n\nYanis (pictured) then had to call his fianc\u00e9 and tell her they would no longer be getting married due to the rule-breaking\n\nOne commented: 'I feel sorry for him, because she couldn't just leave him to do it.'\n\nAnother added: 'I'm just here to see this girl ruin her own wedding.'\n\n'Love donttellthebride but tonight's episode annoyed me so much. Why go on show if you are controlling you sabotage the whole thing,' another wrote.\n\nShanise was left 'heartbroken' when she was told over the phone by her husband-to-be that there would be no wedding\n\nOne said: 'She has no trust...why get upset...you broke the rules and you're lucky they haven't asked for the \u00a313K back?!'\n\nAnother wrote: 'The bride has only got herself to blame for the wedding being cancelled, she checked her fiance's emails because she didn't trust him at all, she ruined her own wedding.'\n\nThey went on: 'I hope he dumps her a**, she wasn't even sorry.'", "description": "Yanis, 23, and Shanise, 19, from Birmingham , were told by producers that the wedding was off, when they discovered that the bride had secretly gone through her\u00a0fianc\u00e9's emails.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston", "Monica Greep For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/08/19384582-0-image-a-22_1570434964523.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
