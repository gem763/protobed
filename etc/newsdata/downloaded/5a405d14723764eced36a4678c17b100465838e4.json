He's very up on his health. He doesn't believe in retirement, he wants to keep going forever, so he's always getting screenings and tests.'\n\n'Rod had a few symptoms. It started moving quite quickly, the results, the numbers. They said we best do a rectal exam. It's the only way. A specialist has to do that. And they did find a lump. Then it was like, 'okay we can't ignore this''.\n\n'We got the shock news it was cancer. We looked at the different ways of dealing with it.'\n\nStarting to cry, Penny said: 'It was [quite aggressive]. It came on really quickly. With Rod it was an aggressive one.\n\nMoment: She said: 'We were in London. He's very up on his health. He doesn't believe in retirement, he wants to keep going forever, so he's always getting screenings and tests'\n\nTears: Starting to cry, Penny said: 'It was [quite aggressive]. It came on really quickly. With Rod it was an aggressive one'\n\n'It left the gland and travelled to the outside tissues. So that was another scary moment where we had to have more invasive tests and scans to see if it was anywhere else secondary in his body, which was the most frightening test of all. But it hadn't gone.'\n\n'It's emotional. We kept it quiet for two and a half years now. The positive news is we caught it early enough.'\n\nDetailing the gruelling radiation treatment the Handbags and Gladrags singer underwent to beat the disease, she said: 'Rod and I were travelling into London at the same time every single day, going to the clinic.\n\n'Rod's never done one day, one week the same ever in his entire life. He put his positive head on, along with myself. The nurses had a little room for him. He took his computer, he said this was like my day in the office.'\n\nPenny said the couple - who shares sons Alastair, 13 and Aiden, eight, made the decision to keep the diagnosis from their kids, with Rod's six other older childen informed.\n\nBrave: The star added: 'It's emotional. We kept it quiet for two and a half years now. The positive news is we caught it early enough'\n\nTogether: The couple, who tied the knot in 2007, received Rod's all-clear in July 2019\n\nThe singer also has Sarah Streeter, Kimberly Stewart, Sean Stewart, Ruby Stewart, Ren\u00e9e Stewart and Liam Stewart from previous relationships.\n\nShe said: 'We told the older ones. Aidan was only five or six so wasn't old enough to understand. It would be too much for them [the younger ones] to understand.\n\n'When daddy finally told everybody the good news, and to get the message out there for guys out there over 50 go and get the test, then we told the little ones.'\n\nDiscussing why the couple kept the diagnosis quiet, she said: 'It was our choice to come out [with the news], as it were. Rod was performing at a prostate cancer event with the Faces.\n\n'After a few songs he said, \"Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming and I have to just take this moment, I owe it to everyone, I'm a survivor\".\n\n'In July he got the all clear, there's no trace at all \u2013 he just wanted to give a message out to all men, especially over 50, you can actually go and request to get a PSA blood test.\n\nHarrowing: Detailing the gruelling radiation treatment the Handbags and Gladrags singer underwent to beat the disease, she said: 'Rod and I were travelling into London at the same time every single day, going to the clinic\n\n'Which will give you a little indication, it's not a sure result. But if there's a sign that the readings are elevated, and if it's the case you can have further examinations rectally, which is an awkward thing for men to talk about.\n\n'Men don't get an offer to come in, you can request it. Really that should move.'\n\nThe star said her husband was doing 'fantastic', adding: 'He's just done a stint in Vegas, flown to New York for a charity event, and he\u2019s back home on Saturday, there\u2019s no slowing him down!\n\nDo Ya Think I'm Sexy star Rod also sent a message into the show urging other men to get tested, saying: 'I've just been given the OK. Guys, please, get down to the doctors and get tested - it's a rotten disease\u2026 Finger up the bum, no harm done.'\n\nThe interview comes after Sir Rod revealed he had beaten prostate cancer last month.\n\nFamily first: Penny said the couple - who shares sons Alastair, 13 and Aiden, eight, made the decision to keep the diagnosis from their kids, with Rod's six other older childen informed\n\nInspiring: Do Ya Think I'm Sexy star Rod also sent a message into the show urging other men to get tested\n\nThe rocker was diagnosed in 2016 but said the disease was caught in the early stages during a routine checkup.\n\nRod revealed his plight during a fundraising evening with former Faces bandmates Kenney Jones and Ronnie Wood, The Mirror reports. 'Two years ago I was \u00addiagnosed with prostate cancer,' He said.\n\nWHAT IS PROSTATE CANCER? Prostate cancer is the growth of tumours in the prostate gland. Only men have a prostate, which is a walnut-sized gland between the rectum and the penis which creates a fluid to be mixed with sperm to create semen. How many people does it kill? More than 11,800 men a year - or one every 45 minutes - are now killed by prostate cancer in Britain, compared with about 11,400 women dying of breast cancer. It means prostate cancer is behind only lung and bowel in terms of how many people it kills in Britain. In the US, the disease kills 26,000 each year. How quickly does it develop? Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs someone has it for many years, according to the NHS. If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, a policy of 'watchful waiting' or 'active surveillance' may be adopted. Some patients can be cured if the disease is treated in the early stages. But if it diagnosed at a later stage, when it has spread, then it becomes terminal and treatment revolves around relieving symptoms. Thousands of men are put off seeking a diagnosis because of the known side effects from treatment, including erectile dysfunction. Tests and treatment There is no national prostate screening programme as for years the tests have been too inaccurate. Doctors struggle to distinguish between aggressive and less serious tumours, making it hard to decide on treatment. Men over 50 are eligible for a \u2018PSA\u2019 blood test which gives doctors a rough idea of whether a patient is at risk. But it is unreliable. Patients who get a positive result are usually given a biopsy which is also not foolproof. Scientists are unsure as to what causes prostate cancer, but age, obesity and a lack of exercise are known risks. Anyone with any concerns can speak to Prostate Cancer UK's specialist nurses on 0800 074 8383 or visit prostatecanceruk.org.\n\nSir Rod added: 'No one knows this, but I thought this was about time I told everybody. I'm in the clear, now, simply because I caught it early. I have so many tests.'\n\nProstate cancer is the growth of tumours in the prostate gland.\n\nOnly men have a prostate, which is a walnut-sized gland between the rectum and the penis which creates a fluid to be mixed with sperm to create semen.\n\nRod, who previously had a cancerous growth removed from his thyroid, urged the audience to 'go to the doctor', telling them he tried to 'keep a smile on his face' throughout the ordeal.\n\nHe said: 'If you're positive, and you work through it and you keep a smile on your face\u2026 I've worked for two years and I've just been happy, and the good Lord looked after me.'\n\nIn 2000, Rod revealed that he feared losing his singing voice after doctors removed a cancerous growth from his thyroid gland.\n\nThe singer was operated on at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital and told his voice would return within six months.\n\nBut the star, who has since vowed to help raise millions for a cancer charity, had to wait considerably longer before he could sing again.\n\nMeanwhile, it emerged last month, that a prostate cancer drug could offer hope to thousands of men with an incurable form of the disease after it succeeded in a clinical trial.\n\nThe medication Lynparza has hit its target of prolonging the lives of men with cancer which survived normal treatment.\n\nIts developers say the drug is the only one to have worked in a field where 'the need for new effective therapies is high'.\n\nLynparza works by destroying the damaged DNA of cancer cells and killing them, and has already been approved around the world for treating ovarian cancer.\n\nLynparza \u2013 the branded name of the drug olaparib \u2013 is being compared with two testosterone-blocking medications currently used by the NHS \u2013 abiraterone and enzalutamide.\n\nThose drugs work by lowering levels of testosterone, the male sex hormone, which many prostate tumours thrive off.\n\nLynparza works differently by targeting damaged DNA to kill tumours and is meant for men whose cancers have continued to grow and spread even when their testosterone levels are medically reduced.", "description": "Penny Lancaster broke down in tears as she discussed husband Rod Stewart's battle with an 'aggressive' form of prostate cancer on Thursday's episode of Loose Women.", "authors": ["Eve Buckland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19540916-0-image-a-93_1570714326087.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
