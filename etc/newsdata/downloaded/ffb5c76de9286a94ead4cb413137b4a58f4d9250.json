Doctors had found several breaks to his ribs and a bleed to the brain.\n\nFather Lee Vernon, 21, admitted killing baby McKenzie - but claimed he accidentally dropped his son before bouncing him around and squeezing him too tightly.\n\nLee Vernon, 21, denied murder and two charges of inflicting GBH with intent but the jury at Maidstone Crown Court rejected his story and convicted him of all three charges\n\nVernon, who was described as 'a manipulative liar,' denied murder and two charges of inflicting GBH with intent but the jury at Maidstone Crown Court rejected his story and convicted him of all three charges.\n\nHe sat with his head bowed as the verdicts were delivered just yards away from the mother, Katrina Ellis, who had attended every day of the trial.\n\nMedical experts disclosed that the baby had suffered multiple injuries, some of which would have been caused on at least two previous occasions.\n\nDuring his trial the prosecution told how Vernon had 'intentionally inflicted non-accidental injuries on his son', resulting in a fractured skull and the bleed on the brain.\n\nThe UK's only forensic bone expert, Professor David Mangham, says he believes injuries were caused deliberately.\n\nMcKenzie was taken to the QEQM Hospital in Margate on July 23 last year after collapsing at his home in Broadstairs, Kent\n\nEarlier in the trail prosecutor Steven Perian QC said: 'These injuries included a skull fracture and a broken blood vessel, close to the internal corner of the left eye.\n\n'There were a number of skeletal fractures found, fractures to the left collarbone, the left ankle and right thigh bone as well as 11 rib fractures.'\n\n'The expert medical opinion is that the fatal head injury caused McKenzie's death but it had occurred in the context of multiple rib fractures and fractures to the left ankle region.'\n\nThe prosecutor said that some of the injuries the baby had suffered happened between one and three weeks before his death.\n\nHe added: 'We say that the fatal injury to McKenzie was caused by shaking the child with a firm grip to the chest causing rib fractures.\n\nVernon, who was described as 'a manipulative liar,' denied murder and two charges of inflicting GBH with intent but the jury at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) rejected his story and convicted him of all three charges\n\n'We also suggest that there had been forcible twisting and pulling of the lower limbs.'\n\nThe court heard how Vernon had gone online to search 'I grabbed my baby too hard, now has bruises' and 'Have you ever accidentally hurt your child when they are having a meltdown.'\n\nWhen McKenzie needed to go to hospital, Vernon didn't join his partner and son but instead went to a BMX and skateboarding how instead.\n\nHe later confessed this was to avoid questions about the injuries.\n\nVernon will be sentenced next month when McKenzie's mother is set to personally read to the court her statement about the impact of her baby's death.\n\nSenior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Richard Vickery said: 'It's impossible to comprehend the suffering that McKenzie endured during his short life at the hands of his father.\n\n'Vernon has shown himself to be a cruel and cowardly man after hurting his helpless baby who looked to him for love and care.\n\n'I'm so grateful to the medical experts and my investigation team who, despite this complex and emotional case, were able to get to the truth of what happened to ensure Vernon's conviction.'", "description": "McKenzie Ellis was taken to hospital after collapsing at his home in Broadstairs, Kent.
