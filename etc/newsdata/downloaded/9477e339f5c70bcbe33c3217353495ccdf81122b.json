The conversation was about how there\u2019s a trend of people filling a dixie cup with water, dunking their testicles in it and having a girl blow into the water with a straw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018My business partner Ryan, who was a part of the conversation, called me up right away laughing and told me, \u201cWe should totally make a real hot tub for people\u2019s testicles.\u201d He told me about the conversation details and I immediately set out to design and 3D print a prototype.\u2019\n\nThe three colours (Picture: Testicuzzi)\n\nThe testicuzzi features a pillow to rest your penis with a chamber to dunk your balls and a battery-powered jet to create the bubbles.\n\nIt\u2019s available to order now, with delivery expected around 10 December so perfect for Christmas.\n\nPride says that it\u2019s already had some pretty great reviews.\n\nHe said: \u2018Those who have used it have said: \u201cIt\u2019s a magical experience.\u201d They genuinely love the way it feels. It\u2019s comfortable, It\u2019s refreshing and relaxing on the testicles.\u2019\n\nAt the minute, it comes in one-size but the creators promise they\u2019ve done their research and it should be big enough for most people.\n\nPride added: \u2018We did a lot of research on testicle size and averages. Penis size varies a lot, but testicle size is actually fairly consistent across the board. We designed the Testicuzzi to be just above the statistical averages and so far everyone no issues with size. We do have plans for varying sizes, more for the ego and the comedy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are three colourways available \u2013 jet black with a red pillow, white with and black pillow and the extremely fancy 14k gold-plated testicuzzi.\n\nThe white and black versions are currently on sale for $39.95 (\u00a334.35), with a standard price of $99.95 (\u00a385.94), while the gold-plated version is $10,000 (\u00a37,701).\n\nGo nuts.\n\nMORE: Man shares what it was like to be raised by a dad with Down\u2019s syndrome\n\nMORE: You Don\u2019t Look Sick: \u2018Crohn\u2019s is more than just lots of trips to the toilet\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Friends create the mini hot tub with a rest for your penis, a chamber for your testicles and a battery-powered jet to create the bubbles.", "authors": ["Laura Abernethy"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_90469747_1571565795.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
