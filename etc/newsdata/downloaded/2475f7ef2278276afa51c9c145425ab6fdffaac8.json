That is the outlook for Joe Marler and England this week as they embrace the tension of knockout rugby. They won\u2019t be driven by fear, or overwhelmed by it.\n\nThe stakes are raised now that the World Cup has reached the quarter-final stage, with Eddie Jones\u2019s squad preparing to face Australia on Saturday.\n\nHaving come out of Test retirement at the end of last season, Harlequins prop Marler is gearing up for the game of his life \u2014 adamant he and his team-mates won\u2019t be inhibited by the threat of an abrupt end.\n\nEngland prop Joe Marler spoke about the fearless and determined attitude held by England\n\nIt is all on the line now. Win or bust. That suits England\u2019s veteran loosehead just fine. \u2018I don\u2019t know what pressure is,\u2019 Marler said.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s pressure. The group have now got a mind-set of, \u201cBring it on \u2014 bring on the challenges\u201d. We embrace it and we look forward to it, as opposed to shying away from it.\n\n\u2018I have been involved in teams who have let nerves overcome them and caved in and allowed the nerves to become negative. I don\u2019t feel that in this group.\n\n\u2018The boys embrace that nervousness and use it as positive energy to drive us on.\u2019\n\nEngland and the other seven teams left standing will play out the remainder of the tournament on the precipice, knowing the equation: one slip and they\u2019re gone. Some will stare into the abyss to find the motivation they need to avoid it. Others will avert their gaze.\n\nBen Youngs watched Owen Farrell (L) and George Ford (R) during training in Miyazaki\n\nEngland hooker Jamie George is known around camp for being Mr Positive all the time\n\n\u2018Each individual is different,\u2019 said Marler when asked about the psychology of the situation. \u2018Jonny Wilkinson used to speak about the thing that drove him most was the fear of failure \u2014 the fear of losing \u2014 and that worked brilliantly for him. He was one of the best players to play the game.\n\n\u2018Jamie George, for example, is Mr Positive and Mr Energy all the time. He doesn\u2019t focus on any negative thoughts because that brings him down. He constantly thinks about enjoying the moment. Next job.\n\n\u2018Everyone is different, but as a collective we focus less on the fear factor, more on the opportunity and the challenge.\u2019\n\nFor his part, Marler claimed to be in the \u2018what will be, will be\u2019 category. He will give body and soul to the cause while trying not to lose sleep about what could go wrong.\n\nHaving denied that memories of the 2015 World Cup loss to Australia and subsequent exit at the pool stage will light the fires within, he was asked what does drive him now.\n\nJoe Marler insisted he was not motivated by revenge after World Cup 2015 loss to Australia\n\n\u2018I want to be part of a squad who win the World Cup,\u2019 he said.\n\nIn September 2018, he opted to stand down from national service, but reversed that decision to play in this World Cup.\n\n\u2018That was part of the reason I came out of retirement. I could see the potential in this group and I wanted a taste of that. That\u2019s ultimately what\u2019s driving me on for the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u2018It hasn\u2019t been easy. I have worked my buns off to try to get back into an emotional and mental state capable of contributing to the squad the best I can.\n\n\u2018And the physical state too \u2014 that has been even harder. You come out of it for a year and you forget how fast they do everything!\u2019 There is never a shortage of wit from Marler and he was in his element, addressing the Anglo-Australian media at the team\u2019s base here, overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWith mountains in the background, he was asked what the ultimate peak would be like, whether winning the World Cup would be life changing.\n\n\u2018Yes, it would be life changing,\u2019 Marler said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure a lot of the 2003 boys will then be looking over their shoulders thinking, \u201cOh God, we\u2019re going to struggle for after-dinner gigs now\u201d!\n\n\u2018Would it be life changing? Of course it would be. It would be an achievement, but I haven\u2019t really thought about that much.\u2019\n\nAfter final pool game was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis England have been hard at work\n\nWhat he has thought about is the Wallabies pack, which is a far more dangerous proposition than it used to be, in the days when Australia\u2019s scrum was a liability.\n\n\u2018Traditionally, in a different generation, there were always question marks over Australia being weak up front and being wet at scrum time,\u2019 said Marler. \u2018But in 2015, when Mario Ledesma was there, he transformed them and made a huge impact.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got Scott Sio, who has got 70 caps and is a top-quality loosehead. Latu, he\u2019s a huge leader for them and a big, big unit. Then you\u2019ve got young Alaalatoa, who\u2019s been going really well in this tournament. So, that narrative is no longer the case.\u2019\n\nAustralia\u2019s forwards are to be respected these days, but not feared. Marler and England have no fear, as they stand on the precipice, averting their gaze.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN BEPPU: No fear.
