I\u2019ve been able to strike my irons pretty well this week so far and that\u2019s been nice.\u201d\n\nThe 15-time major winner lit up the back nine in five-under 31 to take control on an empty Narashino Country Club course, closed to spectators for safety after soaking up more than six inches (150mm) of rain during Friday\u2019s washout.\n\n\u201cI had made a couple putts today and I went to put my hand up and I\u2019m like, don\u2019t put your hand up, there\u2019s no one clapping,\u201d said Woods.\n\nChasing a record-equalling 82nd PGA Tour victory, Woods had bounced back from bogeying his opening three holes to shoot a mesmerising 64 with nine birdies in Thursday\u2019s first round.\n\nHe started more steadily on Saturday and was one-under at the turn before switching on the afterburners.\n\n\u201cHit the ball a little bit better than I did (Thursday),\u201d Woods said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope that trend continues.\u201d\n\nThree birdies in four holes from the 10th took him alongside clubhouse leader Woodland at 10-under.\n\nWoods kept his foot down. The US Masters champion smoked a massive drive down the long par-four 17th and his pinpoint approach from 154 yards left him a simple two-footer to take the solo lead.\n\nHe saw a 20-foot eagle putt slip by at the par-five 18th but tapped in for his seventh birdie of the round and a 36-hole 12-under par total of 128.\n\nUS Open champion and overnight co-leader Woodland said he had to dig deep for his 66 to keep in touch with Woods.\n\n\u201cIt was a grind all day,\u201d said the 35 year-old. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my best stuff today. Fortunately I made three big putts there on 16, 17 and 18 which was awesome.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s postponed round finally began at 10am Saturday on a weather-ravaged course with bright sunshine helping to dry the turf.\n\n\u2013 \u2018It\u2019s going to be a long one\u2019 \u2013\n\nA pond to the left of the 10th fairway had expanded into a lake, forcing officials to move the tee forward, and in a trice a 376-yard par four became a 140-yard par four.\n\nLocal favourite Hideki Matsuyama immediately took advantage of the tiny 10th with an eagle two but trod water thereafter to finish four shots behind Woods.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy had a ragged two-over 72 on Thursday but he too opened with an eagle at the 10th to get back to level par.\n\nA birdie four at the long 14th kept up the momentum and two more gains at 16 and 18 saw him turn in 31 and his way to a 65 to be three-under total, nine behind Woods.\n\nAmerican Keegan Bradley, the 2011 US PGA Championship winner, stormed up the leaderboard with a seven-under 63, the best round of the week, to position himself in Sunday\u2019s final group with Woods and Woodland at eight-under par.\n\nThey will go out in the rescheduled third round at 8:30am on Sunday (2330 GMT Saturday) with the fourth round commencing immediately to get as many holes in before dark.\n\nThe first US PGA Tour event in Japan is destined to finish on Monday.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be a long one and we\u2019re going to play it from sun-up to sundown,\u201d said Woods.\n\n\u201cProbably looking to get somewhere near 27 holes in tomorrow. Hopefully I can play well and get myself right there.\u201d", "description": "Inzai (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Tiger Woods surprised himself with a second straight 64 Saturday for a two-stroke lead over Gary Woodland at the halfway stage", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/061928_prowling-tiger-woods-lines-up-putt-on-green-saturday-pga-tour-zozo-championship-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
