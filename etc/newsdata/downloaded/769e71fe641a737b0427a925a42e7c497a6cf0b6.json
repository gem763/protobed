He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that 'the sun shines down on me' and 'true love will find you in the end.'\"\n\nROBERT FRANK, GROUNDBREAKING PHOTOGRAPHER, DEAD AT 94\n\nThe late visual artist -- whose offbeat career brought him a cult following -- had been plagued for years with health issues, according to his brother, Dick Johnston.\n\n\"I always wanted Danny to feel like his own person, and in control of his own life,\" Dick said. \"Since beginning to work and travel with him in about 2003, we gratefully were able to travel the entire globe for over a decade to get out before the fans. He was always, everywhere, warmly received and he at least knew he was well loved. Health issues have plagued us for years, but I\u2019m glad for the time we had.\u201d\n\n'MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS' ACTOR ROBERT AXELROD DEAD AT 70\n\nTom Gimbel, Daniel's manager of over 25 years also paid tribute to him writing: \"I am so saddened by the news of Daniel's passing. It has been the greatest honor and privilege of my professional life to work with Daniel Johnston - someone who I consider to be one of the greatest songwriting geniuses of our time. In our time together Daniel was more than an artist; he was a friend, he was family. I will miss him greatly but will smile every time I hear his songs.\"\n\nMusicians such as Kurt Cobain and Tom Waits, as well as \"The Simpsons\" creator Matt Groening, are among those who have expressed a fondness for Johnston's work.
