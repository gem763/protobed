Of course, you could always sell an Xbox 360 to help fund an Xbox One, but that\u2019s all down to you. Except things will be different for Microsoft\u2019s next gen console.\n\nCurrently codenamed Project Scarlett, the new console will have an upgrade option if you have an Xbox One with Xbox All Access and have already made all your payments.\n\nXbox All Access is only available in the UK and US but when it launches next month it will allow you to buy a new console in instalments. Currently that includes the Xbox One S, Xbox One S All-Digital Edition, and Xbox One X, but it will also extend to Project Scarlett.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXbox All Access starts on Tuesday, 5 November in the UK and is only available via GAME or Smyths. Obviously the Project Scarlett option isn\u2019t there at the moment but if you buy one of the current consoles you\u2019ll be able to upgrade when it\u2019s out.\n\nThere is a certain amount of small print though, as you\u2019ll have to organise the upgrade from the same shop you joined from and when you trade in the old console it\u2019ll have to be in \u2018good condition\u2019. You\u2019ll also need a decent credit rating.\n\nThe official website is a bit vague as to additional charges when upgrading to Project Scarlett but there is a mention of \u2018applicable fees\u2019 when it happens.\n\nAt the moment though the monthly repayment rates, over 24 months, are down as \u00a317.99 for the Xbox One S All Digital, \u00a319.99 for the Xbox One S, and \u00a324.99 for the Xbox One X.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: PS5 and Project Scarlett have the \u2018greatest compute jump in any console\u2019 claims insider\n\nMORE: Xbox boss rules out streaming-only console for next gen Project Scarlett\n\nMORE: Microsoft will launch Xbox Project Scarlett in 2020 with Halo Infinite", "description": "From next month you\u2019ll be able to buy an Xbox in monthly instalments via Microsoft and upgrade to the next gen console when it comes out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ct0oxHz.0-ee31_1572273442.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
