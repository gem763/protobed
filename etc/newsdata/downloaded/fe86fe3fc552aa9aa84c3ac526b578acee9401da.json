The E Street Group, a firm run by political consultant Tim Mynett, Omar\u2019s alleged lover, received more money from the campaign than any other vendor.\n\nThe Omar campaign paid the E Street Group $149,812.64 between July 1 and Sept. 30, its filings show. That accounts for around 30 percent of Omar\u2019s total campaign disbursements over the same period. Her campaign has over $1.5 million cash on hand.\n\nThe payments represent a significant increase from previous spending on the group\u2019s services. In the first two quarters\u2014the first six months of the year\u2014the campaign paid approximately $160,000 to the E Street Group.
