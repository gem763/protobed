Elizabeth Warren hailed the political power of female-led organizing in a speech Monday night that invoked the deadly 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire to argue that outrage can spark positive change \u2014 and to make the case for her own presidential ambitions.\n\nWarren has long faced doubts from some Democratic leaders and voters who wonder if she would be able to defeat President Trump, because of her outspoken liberal message and voters\u2019 possible reluctance to embrace a woman as president. Monday\u2019s speech, and the big crowd it attracted, was in part an attempt to rebut such doubts by arguing that liberal women have won big change before.\n\n\u201cI wanted to give this speech here \u2014 but not because of the arch behind me or the president this square is named for,\u201d Warren said, reading from a teleprompter in Washington Square Park, blocks from where the Triangle fire killed more than 140 workers, including many young immigrant women.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all \u2014 we\u2019re here because of some hard-working women.\u201d\n\nThe comments were a more direct nod to gender than most of her public remarks to date, which typically focus on the ways in which powerful interests have tilted the country\u2019s government toward elites.\n\nThe event, which the campaign said attracted more than 20,000 and was easily among her largest crowds so far, had been heavily promoted by the Warren campaign in the preceding days. It came as the campaign enters a new phase in which voters will be paying closer attention and the field is narrowing, and as Warren is looking for new ways to show off her momentum.\n\nShe has started holding large rally-style events in an effort to demonstrate that she enjoys enthusiastic grass-roots support from the party\u2019s base. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the other liberal stalwart in the race, made massive rallies a feature of his 2016 campaign and has also started hosting bigger events in recent weeks. Former vice president Joe Biden, who leads in the polls, has so far hewed to smaller-scale appearances.\n\nAt one point in her speech Monday, when Warren said the rich and powerful have \u201cgobbled up opportunity itself\u201d but that \u201cwe have the power to fix that,\u201d the crowd interrupted with chants of \u201cWarren! Warren!\u201d\n\nStill, as she has steadily risen in the polls, questions have persisted among centrists about whether she is offering an agenda that\u2019s too liberal for the country or too polarizing to win a general election. She has spent much of the past few months trying to combat that view and emphasize her ostensible electability and her potentially broad appeal.\n\nAbout an hour before Warren took the stage, a light rain began falling. Still, people continued streaming into Washingon Square Park, tucking \u201cI\u2019m a WARREN Democrat\u201d signs underneath their umbrellas. After a short time the rain subsided, and speakers pumped up the crowd with chants of \u201cDream big! Fight hard!\u201d\n\nIn her speech, Warren likened herself to Frances Perkins, who as President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s labor secretary was the first female member of the U.S. Cabinet. Perkins was not an elected official but is seen as a highly influential and effective public figure.\n\n\u201cWhat did one woman \u2014 one very persistent woman \u2014 backed up by millions of people across this country get done? Big structural change,\u201d Warren said, invoking one of her own campaign slogans. \u201cOne woman, and millions of people to back her up.\u201d\n\nShe credited Perkins, a longtime labor activist, with pushing for major worker protections in New York in the wake of the Triangle fire and with helping launch Social Security, unemployment insurance, the minimum wage and child labor laws. Warren even spoke from a podium built from barn boards from Perkins\u2019s homestead.\n\nIn focusing on Perkins, Warren sought to tie her campaign to the New Deal and an era of powerful liberal accomplishment, and she cited Perkins\u2019s methods to bolster her view of the best way to bring about change. \u201cShe worked the political system relentlessly from the inside, while a sustained movement applied pressure from the outside,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe senator from Massachusetts criticized Trump as \u201ccorruption in the flesh\u201d but did not dwell heavily on the president. She focused on positioning herself as different from political leaders who have pitched voters on change in the past only to fail to deliver, saying she is not soliciting money from powerful individuals or big corporations.\n\n\u201cAmericans disagree on many things, but we don\u2019t want each other\u2019s homes burned down by wildfires,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want each other\u2019s children murdered at school. We don\u2019t want each other\u2019s families bankrupted by medical bills. What we want is for our government to do something.\u201d\n\nWhile Warren spoke in New York, several other Democratic candidates appeared Monday at an event in Galivants Ferry, S.C. Some of the hopefuls talked up their strengths, but Biden played up his long-standing ties with South Carolina, showing why 43 percent of Palmetto State respondents supported him in a recent CBS poll.\n\nThe late senator Fritz Hollings, a popular South Carolina Democrat, \u201cbrung me to the dance,\u201d Biden recounted. When Biden\u2019s first wife and daughter were killed in a 1972 car crash shortly after his election to the Senate, he told the crowd, he considered resigning before he was even sworn in. It was Hollings who persuaded Biden to come to Washington, saying his wife had \u201cworked like the devil to get you here.\u201d\n\nThe crowd gave Biden a standing ovation. Nearly two-thirds of South Carolina Democrats are African American, and Biden touted himself as the best person to counter Trump\u2019s race-oriented rhetoric, which he described as \u201ctrafficking in some of the ugliest forces.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Biden spoke at the 56th anniversary of the bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., which killed four black girls and galvanized the civil rights movement. On Monday, he portrayed his campaign as a continuation of that fight.\n\n\u201cThere can be no realization of the American Dream without continuing to grapple with the original sin of slavery,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all now realize that violence does not live in the past. If you give it oxygen, it comes back.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s speech in New York also focused on great progressive causes, in her case the battle for the rights of women and workers. Her speech came hours after she released a wide-ranging anticorruption plan that seeks to dramatically limit the influence of former federal lawmakers and lobbyists while expanding protections for workers.\n\nAmong the nearly 100 suggested changes in the proposal, lobbyists would be banned from all campaign fundraising activities \u2014 including \u201cbundling\u201d the contributions of other donors \u2014 and campaigns would not be able to receive \u201cintangible benefits,\u201d such as opposition research, from foreign governments.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign also received a boost Monday with an endorsement from the Working Families Party, a liberal group that endorsed Sanders\u2019s effort in 2016. On Monday night, Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, introduced Warren before she spoke at Washington Square Park.\n\n\u201cRepeat after me: people power! People power!\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cNow louder, so they can hear you in Mar-a-Lago!\u201d\n\nLinskey and Wang reported from New York, and Wootson reported from South Carolina.", "description": "The senator invoked activism that followed the deadly 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire to argue that outrage can spark positive change.", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign", "Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns", "Cleve Wootson Jr.", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2pcEqGVMy0NrhzTRBG4qkTy_dRM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/32R7BVGY5EI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
