U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has also suggested the project could not advance before concerns were met.", "description": "Facebook's Libra faces support test after big payment backers quit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D0R5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
