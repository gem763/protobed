Specifically, Trump asked Zelensky about Biden\u2019s role in securing the firing of a prosecutor who was investigating an energy firm to which Hunter had ties.\n\nBut an impeachment push faces a tough climb, particularly in the Republican-dominated Senate, where a two-thirds majority vote is needed to convict the president.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, however, said that he believed that Senate would convict Trump, and said it would be better if the president stepped down instead. He repeatedly mentioned Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 before being impeached due to the Watergate scandal.\n\n\u201cThose closest to Donald Trump, many of whom are alarmed by his behavior and his lawlessness and the crimes that he's committed, need to sit down...and help him to make that same decision,\" O'Rourke said. \"Republican senators today in 2019, much as they did with Richard Nixon need to sit down with the president and make clear to him that there is no way out of this without a trial in the Senate, a trial which I believe will convict the president of these crimes.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nO\u2019Rouke\u2019s calls are unlikely to be heeded by the White House. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Sky News Friday that he would like to testify to Congress and has said that everything he did was \u201cperfectly legal.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has defended himself vigorously and has gone on the attack against his Democratic opponents. On Saturday, he accused prominent members of the opposition party of acting like \u201csavages.\u201d", "description": "Democratic 2020 hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke on Saturday called on President Trump to resign over the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s July call with the Ukrainian president -- saying it would be the best chance at bringing the nation together.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Trump-Beto080719.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
