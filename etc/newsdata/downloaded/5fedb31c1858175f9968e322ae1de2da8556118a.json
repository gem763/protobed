I will never get used to it.\"\n\nHoyer has started 37 games and thrown for 48 touchdowns, along with 30 interceptions, over his 10-year career, which includes two different stops with New England.\n\nThe Patriots, however, moved on from him and decided to make rookie Jarrett Stidham \u2013 a fourth-round pick in the 2019 draft \u2013 Brady's primary backup.\n\n\"Brian provided a lot,\" Brady said. \"He just brought a great positive energy to the team. Always optimistic, and I think there's times for me that I get frustrated or I get down or disappointed with things that may have happened, and he would always try and bring me back to center pretty quickly.\n\n\"I love the relationship I have with him. It will certainly continue on in its own personal way. We just won\u2019t be working together.\"\n\n\"I thought both Hoyer and Stidham played well in camp, and I liked both players,\" Patriots head coach Bill Belichick told reporters last weekend.\n\n\"But in the end, there are a number of considerations that you have to make, so we did what we thought was best for the team. I still think Brian's a good player.\"\n\nThe Patriots will open the regular season against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.", "description": "Tom Brady discussed the departure of Brian Hoyer, who joined the Indianapolis Colts after he was released by the New England Patriots.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WLCwaJu0zDfWmxZTDTk9dA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FaQvF8vhgbYr0oUG1Kj6FA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/973b9943608d4b7c881163ce5062221b"}
