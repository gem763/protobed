Maybe we\u2019re scoring more runs than the other team, but shoot, maybe we\u2019re finally coming around.\u201d If Rendon\u2019s answer lacked the polish of most postgame interviews, it may have gotten closer to the banal truth of the matter. Minus Harper, Washington\u2019s principals are largely the same as in recent seasons. Rendon dispenses doubles and homers, the pair of right-handed aces Strasburg and Max Scherzer pace the rotation, and the prodigious 20-year-old Juan Soto hits cleanup and patrols left. The manager, Davey Martinez, is also a holdover; in his first season last year, the Nationals went a disappointing 82\u201380. A talented team has won when it counts; it could be as simple as that.\n\nFans and analysts concoct theories, of course. The most popular is that Harper\u2019s departure has been a blessing. His up-and-down production, the thinking goes, is more than made up for by a new egalitarianism. The biggest moment of the playoff run so far, an eighth-inning rally in the Wild Card game to turn a one-run deficit into a one-run lead, was a collaboration: The stalwart Ryan Zimmerman muscled a bloop hit, Rendon walked to load the bases, and Soto drove in the winning runs. Washington fans have added mocking updates to their old Harper jerseys during the playoff run; the slugger\u2019s new team, the Philadelphia Phillies, went .500 and missed the postseason. \u201cWhat I believe in is it takes more than one person to win the championship,\u201d Martinez said earlier this week, \u201cand that\u2019s been the message since Spring Training.\u201d\n\nStrasburg\u2019s playoff run, too, has had a pleasingly corrective quality. The Nationals\u2019 first-ever postseason appearance, back in 2012, featured a controversy over their benching of the then-24-year-old flamethrower, who was two years removed from Tommy John surgery. The team wanted to protect its player, along with its investment; as the Nationals lost to the Cardinals in five games, critics wondered why Washington hadn\u2019t sat Strasburg earlier in the season. Seven years later, Strasburg has proven to be the postseason dynamo fans envisioned at the time. He entered in relief to hold the Brewers scoreless for three frames in the Wild Card game and, on short rest just three days later, out-dueled the Dodgers\u2019 Clayton Kershaw in the second game of the division series. Strasburg has allowed only four runs over 22 postseason innings, with 33 strikeouts.\n\nStill, the Nationals\u2019 newfound playoff success is hard to square with its lackluster history. Where Scherzer, a two-time Cy Young winner with Washington, ran into bad luck and shoddy bullpen support in past postseasons, he now looks like his steamrolling self, firing 21 strikeouts over three appearances against the Dodgers and Cardinals. The Nationals\u2019 comeback win in the deciding game against L.A.\u2014hinging on a pair of eighth-inning homers from Rendon and Soto and an extra-inning grand slam from the veteran Howie Kendrick\u2014mirrored the ways they used to fall short. The Dodgers were, by almost any measure, the superior team, with a deeper pitching staff, a heartier lineup, and a more accomplished bullpen. It\u2019s perhaps to the Nationals\u2019 advantage, now, that they know how little such designations matter.", "description": "Breaking a pattern of first-round heartbreak, the decade\u2019s most downtrodden playoff team finds itself in the World Series.", "authors": ["Robert O'Connell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RC9R/facebook.jpg?1571239646", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
