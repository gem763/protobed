Getty Images\n\nThat was when the first half of this fine competition felt so exacting, when there was a competitive balance to it that always left things on a knife-edge. And even if it doesn\u2019t actually end up like that, that is how it is currently set up. It\u2019s well primed.\n\nSo far, only three of the nine or so major clubs have looked any way as comfortable or commanding as would have been expected. They are Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.\n\nAnd in their groups, that has left other big-league heavyweights in real trouble: Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur. It means that, even if those three are running away with it, the ripples from that may create waves - and excitement - elsewhere.\n\nIn between, then, there are so many groups that are now properly in the balance. That really does feel like the late 1990s, where properly good teams have to really bring their quality to make sure, rather than just coast. That could be seen in the resilience of Atletico Madrid and Juventus, and - more resoundingly - the quality of some of the goals this week\n\nEven if Bayern ended up battering a collapsing Tottenham Hotspur, that was not the case at 1-1, when the pressure was on a player like Robert Lewandowski - who so badly wants to finally win the Champions League - to produce a moment of quality. He more than did that.\n\nHe produced a moment of exceptional quality. It was of the exacting type that reminded of the days in the late 90s when the truly elite clubs like Juventus would just produce the maximum out of the minimum; when they\u2019d so ruthlessly and thrillingly exploit any space given up; when they\u2019d show any opposition - yes - the level.\n\nThe way Lewandowski used Jan Vertonghen as a disguise, to only add to the devastating quality of his finish, was just a vintage example of this.\n\nIt was much the same at Camp Nou, where Barcelona certainly didn\u2019t batter Internazionale. It was the opposite. They needed salvation, or they would have been in real trouble. They got it, in true genius, on multiple levels.\n\nLeo Messi just cut through the Inter defence in that incomparably incisive way he can, to feed Luis Suarez, for the Uruguayan to take the kind of incredibly inventive touch that only he can to then finish superbly. It was next level.\n\nMore importantly, though, these were not just displays of power or class that we\u2019ve still seen in the group stage so many times before. The players didn\u2019t do these things because they could, in hugely forgiving conditions. They did it because they had to, in increasingly demanding conditions.\n\nSome of the reasons for this do feel obvious in that there are a fair few of the super-clubs going through transitional periods, or overcoming current struggles. Some of it, however, is down to something that the Champions League should really be about; that it used to be about.\n\nIt has been about good sides from smaller leagues. You only have to look at the trouble Red Bull Salzburg gave Liverpool, or the utter panic Club Brugge caused Madrid. There\u2019s then been the spark of both Dinamo Zagreb and Red Star Belgrade.\n\nIt is possible - and, in truth, probable - that much of this will pass; that it will be eroded by the usual major forces of the competition. These sides likely fade away. Money will out. Even if that does happen, though, there has already been a level of jeopardy introduced to the group stages we haven\u2019t seen for some time.\n\nMany groups already look like they will go to the wire, not least those involving Spurs, Chelsea, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Those are some names. That, at last, is the level of this competition right now.", "description": "After a hard-fought win over\u00a0Lille, where Frank Lampard admitted he had prioritised this match due to the pressure of the group, the Chelsea\u00a0manager added a comment that might well have been a wider analysis of the competition. \u201cThis Champions League level is something else,\u201d he said, almost as he exhaled.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/08/Eden-Hazard.jpg"}
