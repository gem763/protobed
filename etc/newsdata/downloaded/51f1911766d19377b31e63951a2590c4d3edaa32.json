In 2008, Barack Obama rode momentum from a key victory in Iowa to defeat Hillary Clinton in the state, even though she started with a double-digit lead early on in the race. But as Biden\u2019s campaign points out, Clinton had a strong edge in 2016 \u2014 and kept it, winning handily.\n\nIn interviews with dozens of voters, Democratic state officials, and political strategists, most agreed: Biden shouldn\u2019t assume he\u2019s got this wrapped up, and candidates picking up in the polls, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, shouldn\u2019t count themselves out. Other challengers, including Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, still have the potential to expand their gains in-state, officials added.\n\n\u201cRight now, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s to win,\u201d Spartanburg County Democratic Party Chair Angela Geter, who has yet to endorse a candidate, tells Vox. \u201cNobody has it in the bag. Everybody needs to put in the work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually surprised at how many people are paying attention to these polls, given what happened in 2008,\u201d says Anton Gunn, Obama\u2019s 2008 South Carolina political director, who is not affiliated with any current campaign. Biden\u2019s team, meanwhile, says they\u2019re not taking his lead in the state for granted.\n\nSouth Carolina poses a central test for both Biden and Warren\u2019s campaigns. It\u2019s the fourth state to vote in 2020, after Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, and it\u2019s one of the most diverse.\n\nFor Biden, there\u2019s a question of whether his legacy will be enough to sustain a make-or-break win. For Warren, there\u2019s a question of just how much support she\u2019s built up among African American voters, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most important constituencies.\n\nBiden currently maintains a strong lead, but it\u2019s narrowed some: While he came in at 46 percent in a Post and Courier poll in May, that\u2019s since dipped to 36 percent in an August survey from the paper. In those same polls, Warren\u2019s support shot up from 8 percent to 17 percent.\n\nWarren\u2019s now second in the state, ahead of Sanders and Harris, according to RealClearPolitics\u2019s polling average. She\u2019s also picked up momentum in both Iowa and New Hampshire, where she\u2019s effectively tied with Biden.\n\nMany voters in the Palmetto State are still making up their minds, a factor that adds to the uncertainty. Based on an October survey from Winthrop University, over 50 percent of South Carolina voters currently say they could still switch candidates.\n\n\u201cI think that people are firmly Joe Biden right now, but I think that that can change,\u201d CeCe Grant, 53, a Columbia resident who works in environmental conservation, tells Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t think this race is locked at all.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s the clear frontrunner in South Carolina\n\nOf the early states, South Carolina holds particular significance: The Democratic electorate is more than 60 percent African American and the outcome of this race is seen as a bellwether for how much backing candidates are able to rally from voters of color.\n\nNo Democratic candidate has won the nomination without South Carolina since 2004, when then North Carolina Sen. John Edwards beat out former Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.\n\nFor both Biden and Warren, this February 29 primary will send a decisive message going into Super Tuesday: Either they\u2019re able to secure a strong degree of African American support, or they\u2019re simply not resonating with a crucial constituency of the Democratic base.\n\nCurrently, Biden is in a far stronger position with black voters, especially older African Americans, who associate him fondly with Obama.\n\n\u201cThe black folks support Biden, next to Jesus right now, that\u2019s where he is,\u201d Dot Scott, head of Charleston\u2019s NAACP chapter, told Vox. \u201cYou cannot underestimate how African Americans felt that he was willing and accepting of serving under the first black president. That\u2019s huge. That\u2019s a level of respect being shown to black people.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s visits to the state over the years have also helped many Democrats feel like they know him.\n\nSeveral people I spoke with pointed to his numerous trips to South Carolina, including the eulogy he gave at former Sen. Fritz Hollings\u2019s funeral even before he began his run for president. According to his campaign, he\u2019s also attended several other events in recent years, including a 2014 commencement address at the University of South Carolina and the 2017 unveiling of a Hollings commemorative statue in Charleston.\n\n\u201cYou know Joe Biden\u2019s record. This is not his first time getting on the train,\u201d says Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see the dividends of his long term investments in the state.\u201d\n\nBiden supporters also see him as the \u201cseasoned\u201d pick, who\u2019s best poised to not only beat President Donald Trump, but help the country find its footing after he takes office. He\u2019s \u201cMr. Reliable,\u201d says Seawright.\n\nAnd while aspects of Biden\u2019s record have prompted pushback from some Democrats, his fans aren\u2019t shaken by them. Concerns over his handling of Anita Hill\u2019s testimony during the Clarence Thomas hearings, his vote for the Iraq War, and his work on the 1994 crime bill, are outweighed by the stability his leadership could represent, they say.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t faze me,\u201d said Anthony Cunningham, 47, a city council member in Fountain Inn, South Carolina, when asked about Biden\u2019s political missteps.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really hurt him because people feel like they have that affection for him because he was Uncle Joe,\u201d Spartanburg\u2019s Geter said. \u201cHe certainly has his baggage, but I don\u2019t know that that baggage is substantial enough for people to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not going to vote for him.\u2019\u201d\n\nBiden also has another thing working in his favor: The electability argument he\u2019s making is resonating with some voters, many who see him as the best option to take out the president.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what matters for me is whether or not they can beat Trump,\u201d Lawrence Davis, 51, an adjunct professor who lives in Sumter County, South Carolina, told Vox. \u201cBased on ... who can beat Trump, my candidate is Joe Biden, Biden all the way.\u201d Davis noted that he hoped the country would one day elect a woman for president, but he wasn\u2019t sure it would in 2020.\n\nAs has been seen nationally, a focus on retaking the White House is central to many voters\u2019 decision.\n\n\u201cSouth Carolinians are very pragmatic voters. While our ground operation was helpful to inspiring voters to vote for the \u2018change candidate\u2019 [in 2008], right now South Carolinians are laser-focused on the change being to get Trump out of office,\u201d said Alaina Beverly, a deputy political director in the state on Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. \u201cThat is always going to yield in favor of Joe Biden winning South Carolina.\u201d\n\nA Biden victory in the state looks increasingly critical for his path to the nomination. Of the four early states, South Carolina is the only one where he maintains a substantial lead on Warren.\n\n\u201cIf Biden loses South Carolina, it probably means his edge with [African American voters] has dissipated, meaning that the person who caused that support to dissipate likely would be in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d says University of Virginia\u2019s Kyle Kondik.\n\nElizabeth Warren is making inroads\n\nGiven the parallels between this cycle and the 2008 primary, some Democrats wonder whether Warren \u2014 or others \u2014 could pull off what Obama did and overtake Biden, the establishment candidate. At this point in the race in 2008, Obama was lagging behind Hillary Clinton in the polls, though he ultimately defeated her by a 55-27 percent margin.\n\n\u201cIt has that same feel it had in \u201908,\u201d South Carolina state Rep. Jerry Govan, the head of the state\u2019s legislative black caucus, told Vox. \u201cI think that anything can still happen.\u201d Candidates besides Biden could still see big gains before the primary, he emphasized.\n\nAccording to South Carolina state politics experts, Warren is particularly making inroads among African American women, a crucial contingency she\u2019s beginning to impress with her expansive roster of plans and focus on issues like maternal mortality and reparations.\n\n\u201c[I like] the fact that she\u2019s a woman candidate, and she\u2019s got an answer,\u201d Lisa Ivy, 51, a Warren supporter and member of the Sumter County Democrats, said. \u201cI like the fire that she gives when she talks.\u201d\n\nWinning support from African American women is integral to performing well in the state, where they make up a plurality of the Democratic electorate. At a national level, African American women also vote at the highest rates and are consistently the most dedicated Democratic supporters.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s that history teacher you\u2019d want to have because she\u2019ll give everything to you at face value,\u201d adds Desiree Haywood, 28, the secretary for the South Carolina Democratic Black Caucus. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell you everything you need to know for the test.\u201d\n\nSince this summer, Warren has managed to increase her share of national support among African American voters. As Politico\u2019s Maya King pointed out, Warren\u2019s backing among black voters rose by 9 percentage points between Quinnipiac polls in August and September. According to the September Quinnipiac survey, she now has 19 percent of African American voters\u2019 support, compared to Biden\u2019s 40 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen Elizabeth Warren started the race, she was in single digits with African American voters,\u201d said South Carolina state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, 28, a Warren supporter. \u201cShe\u2019s a white female from Massachusetts \u2014 of course she\u2019s from Oklahoma [originally], but doesn\u2019t have any roots in South Carolina, or a lot of these Deep South communities. I think it\u2019s a matter of folks getting to know her, getting to know her message.\u201d\n\nEarly national surveys showed Warren lagging on this front, a dynamic that officials chalked up to name recognition and her position as an \u201cunknown.\u201d Several voters also raised the \u201celectability\u201d question, including one who emphasized that her handling of the controversy around her claims of Native American heritage and DNA test prompted concern about whether she could effectively confront Trump.\n\nSouth Carolina Democrats say Warren needs to continue refining her message and dialing up outreach toward African American voters if she wants to keep on growing this backing. Among the 2020 Democrats, Warren\u2019s visits to the state have been sparser than several of the other leading contenders. She currently ranks 14th when it comes to visits she\u2019s paid the state, behind Tom Steyer and Sen. Michael Bennet, according to a tracker from the Post and Courier.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign says she has nine offices in the state and plans to open up even more in the coming months. They add that the campaign is investing in \u201cpeople and infrastructure,\u201d and focused on holding events, like a recent town hall in Orangeburg centering on student debt that \u201cconnect her own story with local issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust in the candidate matters, especially for African American voters. You aren\u2019t going to pick somebody you don\u2019t recognize. She\u2019s got a lot of room she has to make up among African Americans,\u201d says Scott Huffmon, executive director of the Winthrop University poll.\n\nIn addition to increasing her own presence in the state, veterans of the Obama 2008 campaign say that Warren needs to recruit and promote more surrogates.\n\n\u201cAre there are any African American leaders in Massachusetts who are campaigning on behalf of Elizabeth Warren?\u201d Gunn asked. \u201cWho\u2019s vouching for her that\u2019s black and respected? If she doesn\u2019t have any surrogates who are campaigning on her behalf, it\u2019s going to be hard to get that black support and make that connection.\u201d\n\nBoth Gunn and Beverly credited the Warren campaign with a strong grassroots operation, but argued that additional events, including those in smaller settings, like people\u2019s homes, would be important.\n\n\u201cThe importance of retail politics cannot be overstated for South Carolinians,\u201d Beverly added. \u201cThey want to be asked for their vote.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a generational split in how African American voters are leaning\n\nWhile Biden\u2019s national poll numbers with African American voters look very strong, the top lines obscure a key differentiator: age.\n\nAccording to an October Morning Consult poll, Biden has 41 percent support from African American voters overall. When this data is broken out by age, however, Biden has just 25 percent support among African American voters ages 18-29, and 32 percent among African American voters ages 30-44, compared to 48 percent among African American voters 45-54, 53 percent among African American voters 55-64 and 56 percent among African American voters over 65.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a generational gap between younger African Americans and older African Americans,\u201d Garvin said. \u201cYounger African Americans like Joe Biden, but a lot of us aren\u2019t supportive of Joe Biden, because we want a change in policies. We aren\u2019t looking to tinker around the edges.\u201d\n\nThough Joe Biden is by far performing best with older African American voters, Bernie Sanders wins a larger share of those 18-29 and 30-44, nationally. Warren, Harris, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg continue to trail both Biden and Sanders in these age groups, though Warren has seen growth among them between June and October.\n\nYounger voters I spoke with broadly expressed a deep respect for Biden, but argued that they were interested in representation that pushed for more ambitious change.\n\nCollege students Andrea Kimpson, 17, and Hayle Turner, 18, are fans of Harris and Buttigieg, and they wondered if Biden would be \u201cadaptable to the needs of the new electorate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is my first election, and I want it to reflect my values and not those of my parents or grandparents,\u201d Kimpson said.\n\n\u201cThey are defending him so hard,\u201d Haywood told Vox, about the commitment many voters have to Biden. \u201cOlder black people are actually really conservative; they just paint over things.\u201d\n\nYounger voters are poised to play a major role in the 2020 primary, if they turn out in strong numbers. In 2018, turnout among younger voters spiked nationally jumping from 20 percent in 2014 to 36 percent.\n\nWere a surge like this to play out in 2020, it could wind up benefitting candidates like Sanders and Warren.\n\nSouth Carolina is a proving ground before Super Tuesday\n\nOf the four states that hold primaries or caucuses in February, before a deluge of delegates is up for grabs in 13 states on Super Tuesday, South Carolina is last.\n\nBecause of their placement in the primary schedule, the outcomes of the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire could have an impact on South Carolina, giving whoever wins those states a boost of momentum. Obama\u2019s win in Iowa, for example, was seen as central to bolstering his victory in South Carolina, because it showed voters that a predominately white electorate would support an African American man for the presidency.\n\n\u201cWhen Barack Obama won Iowa, that helped us close the deal with white voters. When white voters in South Carolina saw that ... that\u2019s what helped us close the gap,\u201d said Gunn, Obama\u2019s 2008 South Carolina political director.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that a similar dynamic could emerge again this time around, with an Iowa victory playing in Warren\u2019s favor.\n\nThe results in South Carolina \u2014 meanwhile \u2014 will set the tone for both Biden and Warren\u2019s campaigns for the rest of the primary.\n\n\u201cNo Democratic nominee since Michael Dukakis has won the nomination without also winning nationally among African American voters,\u201d University of South Carolina\u2019s David Darmofal said. \u201cIf Sen. Warren finishes a distant second behind Biden, or behind other candidates in South Carolina, this would suggest a potentially serious limitation in her candidacy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, if Biden loses the state, it could deal a major \u2014 and potentially fatal \u2014 blow to his campaign.", "description": "Democrats in the state recall how Hillary Clinton\u2019s double-digit lead collapsed in 2008.", "authors": ["Li Zhou", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cK22_su-06FBIzmoGyMNH2XtGmY=/0x640:8256x4963/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19306765/GettyImages_1168719042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
