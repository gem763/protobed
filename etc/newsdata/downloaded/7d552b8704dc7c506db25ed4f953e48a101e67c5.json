Tesla delivered 17,483 Model S and Model X vehicles in the third quarter, compared to 79,703 Model 3 cars. And Musk anticipates the Model Y, which has yet to be produced, could surpass Model 3 sales.\n\nStill, while the Model S and X are more expensive and lower volume than the Model 3, the vehicles have been important to the financial health of the company for years. Tesla\u2019s automotive gross margins have been buffeted in the past by sales of the higher-priced (and better margin per vehicle) Model S and X vehicles.\n\nThe vehicles might not be part of the company\u2019s long-term future. But for now, Tesla is sticking with the two vehicles.\n\nTesla is increasing production on Model S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand for the electric vehicles, CFO Zach Kirkhorn noted during the call.\n\nAs Tesla has launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, the company is now able to focus its attention on the rest of its products, Kirkhorn said.\n\nTesla continues to see a strengthened order rate, which the company anticipates will be reflected in Model S and X deliveries in the fourth quarter, Kirkhorn added.\n\nMusk did take time to rave about the Model S, particularly the newer version, which has a new \u201cRaven\u201d power train.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to drive, it makes you feel like Superman driving that car,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s incredibly safe.\u201d\n\nMusk then described the X as \u201cthe faberge of cars,\u201d before adding that \u201cit\u2019s an art piece basically.\u201d", "description": "Tesla continues to produce the Model S and Model X more for \u201csentimental reasons than anything else,\u201d CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday during a call with investors, calling the electric vehicles \u201cniche\u201d products. \u201cThey are really of minor importance to future,\u201d Musk added.
