The Thomas cook customers have since left and flown home, according to their social media postings [L5N26D0FR].\n\nAt the meeting on Sunday the company was asking its lenders to restructure or lower their demands. It has also asked credit card companies to release 50 million pounds that they hold as collateral against the company's bookings.\n\nThe company's largest shareholder, China's Fosun, was due to take a central role in the restructuring.\n\nA person familiar with the situation told Reuters there was still a possibility they could strike a deal. The person declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFINAL HOURS\n\nWere Thomas Cook to fail, it would spark the biggest peacetime repatriation effort in British history.\n\nThe government and the aviation regulator have drawn up a plan to step in and use other airlines to bring Britons home if needed. The person familiar with the situation put the cost of that move at around 600 million pounds.\n\nOn top of the British holidaymakers, some 460,000 other customers are also abroad, with many coming from Germany or Scandinavia.\n\nAn official from Germany said under that country's rules, it would fall to insurance companies to help get customers home.\n\nCondor, a German airline owned by Thomas Cook, said in a statement that its parent company was doing everything it could to secure fresh funds. \"Negotiations with all key stakeholders are complex and ongoing. The Condor flights are currently being operated on a regular basis.\"\n\nNews of Thomas Cook's potential demise has sparked alarm not just across the holiday resorts and poolside bars where customers are using social media to obtain updates, but among suppliers and future customers who are losing faith.\n\nThat is draining the company of the liquidity it needs to keep operating and ramping up the pressure on one of Britain's oldest and much-loved companies.\n\nAccording to figures from the UK-based aviation consultancy IBA Group, all but a handful of its 116 aircraft are leased rather than owned directly. So far there are no visible signs that leasing companies are demanding their planes back, preferring to sit out the refinancing talks.\n\n\"Hi Annie, I understand your father might be unsettled by all the news surrounding Thomas Cook and our business recently but our flight operations continue to operate as normal,\" the company said in response to one worried customer.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The British government has plans in place to bring home stranded holidaymakers if Thomas Cook goes out of business, an event that would likely spark chaotic scenes at resorts and airports around the world.
