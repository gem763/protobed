Bill Haslam that would help bridge the rural broadband divide through tax credits and allowing electric cooperatives to offer internet and video services.\n\nH.B. 529, which is sponsored by 20 Republicans and will be heard in the House Business and Utilities Committee on Wednesday after a week delay, would deregulate Tennessee\u2019s 23 electric cooperatives for the purpose of providing broadband and cable services to their customers. That bill previously passed the House Business and Utilities Subcommittee by a 13-0 vote and is expected to pass the full committee and be sent to the Tennessee House for a vote.\n\nCompanion bill S.B. 1215 has been referred to the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee.\n\nLevoy Knowles, executive director of the TTA, told Watchdog.org in a statement that \u201cmembers of the Tennessee Telecommunications Association support the Governor\u2019s efforts to bring broadband to rural Tennesseans who remain without service.\u201d\n\nNot all members of the groups stand united in support of the measure. Jonathan Harlan, founder and CEO of TTA associate member Aeneas Communications LLC, based in Jackson, previously told Watchdog he\u2019s against the bill due to concerns about the advantages electric co-ops have gained through lower property taxes and government grants. He and other providers told Watchdog the recent political climate in Tennessee, with the possibility of municipal networks being allowed to expand or for co-ops to offer service, has had a chilling effect, making smaller providers wary of growing into certain areas.\n\n\u201cWe have other cities in which we want to build in west Tennessee, but now I have to consider whether utility companies are going to be my competitor,\u201d Harlan said.\n\nRELATED: Tennessee internet providers wary of bill allowing co-ops to offer broadband\n\nThe members of TTA, a nonprofit industry trade group that represents both private and cooperative providers of telephone and internet services, have installed more than 12,000 miles of fiber and provide broadband to more than 136,000 rural residents of Tennessee, Knowles noted.\n\n\u201cAs providers of high-speed broadband and fiber to many parts of rural Tennessee, we know there are still places that need to get connected,\u201d he said. \u201cOur position is to address the coverage gaps first and provide broadband to all Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nKnowles added that the TTA welcomes the governor\u2019s plan to offer $45 million in grants and tax credits to help facilitate rural broadband expansion. The bill would provide $10 million in grants per year for three years and $5 million in tax credits on the purchase of equipment for broadband construction over the same duration.\n\nJohnny Kampis reports on national issues for Watchdog.org.
