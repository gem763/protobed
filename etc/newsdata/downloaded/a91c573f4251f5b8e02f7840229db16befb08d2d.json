Many of the biggest names in American music were there, everyone from operetta master Victor Herbert (an ASCAP founder) to \u201cMarch King\u201d John Phillip Sousa. But it was a less famous young man, smoking a cigar and doing a brilliant impromptu turn at the club piano, who stole the show. \u201cThere,\u201d remarked Victor Herbert, \u201cis a young man with a future.\u201d\n\nVictor Herbert was right. The \u201cyoung man with a future\u201d was George Gershwin. In a tragically short but incredibly productive life, he would create a memorable body of music that would help shape American musical theater, provide some of the best numbers for the Golden Age of Hollywood musicals and bring a distinctly American, jazz-inspired sensibility to the classic concert stage. There was, to borrow the title of one of his countless hits, a \u201cFascinating Rhythm\u201d to the life and works of composer George Gershwin.\n\nIn his own words, the rhythm began when he was a 6-year-old living in Harlem with his Russian-Jewish immigrant parents and \u201cstood outside a penny arcade listening to an automatic piano leaping through Rubinstein\u2019s Melody in F. The peculiar jumps in the music held me rooted. To this very day I can\u2019t hear the tune without picturing myself outside that arcade on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, standing there barefoot and in overalls, drinking it all in avidly.\u201d\n\nIn an era where even families of modest means aspired to having a piano, his parent\u2019s acquisition of one began an ever-more-serious round of piano lessons that introduced this born musician to the rudiments of technique, musical theory and, of course, notation. Ragtime or Rubinstein, to George Gershwin, it was all music. And music was his first and strongest love.\n\nPlaying saloons, silent movie theaters and \u201clegitimate\u201d stage venues, he perfected his finesse as a pianist while deepening his musical range and knowledge. By the time he died of a brain tumor at age 38, on July 11, 1937, he was certainly the best, and probably the most world famous American popular composer of his time.\n\nI became convinced of his pre-eminence after listening to two anthology CDs, one featuring major artists performing Cole Porter favorites and the other featuring many of the same artists singing Gershwin evergreens. While Porter\u2019s lyrics are probably a notch above those written for Gershwin by his brother, Ira, Gershwin\u2019s music simply had more depth and breadth to it \u2014 more alive and more rooted in real feeling.\n\nThe legendary stage and film director Rouben Mamoulian, whom I got to know in his later years, agreed to direct Gershwin\u2019s \u2014 at the time \u2014 highly controversial black-jazz-fusion opera, \u201cPorgy and Bess,\u201d after a memorable evening in the composer\u2019s Manhattan apartment where the Gershwin brothers handed him a tall highball and put him in a comfortable leather armchair as \u201cGeorge sat down at the piano while Ira stood over him like a guardian angel \u2026 To describe George\u2019s face while he sang \u2018Summertime\u2019 is something that is beyond my capacity \u2026 It was very late into the night before we finished the opera and sometimes I think that in a way it was the best performance I ever heard.\u201d\n\nReaders will come away from \u201cSummertime\u201d agreeing with the gracious eulogy delivered by one of George Gershwin\u2019s most prominent peers, librettist Oscar Hammerstein II:\n\n\u201cWe remember a smile that was nearly always on his face, a cigar that was nearly always in his mouth. He was a lucky young man, lucky to be so in love with the world, and lucky because the world was so in love with him. It endowed him with talent. It endowed him with character. And, rarest of all things, it gave him a complete capacity for enjoying his gifts.\u201d\n\nIn the context of his time and setting, George Gershwin was something close to an American Mozart. Like Mozart, he died in his 30s, still at the height of his powers. And, like Mozart, his zest for life complimented rather than distracted from his love of music. As author Richard Crawford sums it up, George Gershwin\u2019s days on earth may have been limited to the summertime season of life, but \u201cthe music he left behind, endowed with his extraordinary inventiveness and intellectual curiosity, has yet to cease thriving as an evergreen gift to the world.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Aram Bakshian Jr., a former aide to Presidents Nixon, Ford and Reagan, has written widely on politics, history, gastronomy and the arts.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nSUMMERTIME: GEORGE GERSHWIN\u2019S LIFE IN MUSIC\n\nBy Richard Crawford\n\nNorton, $39.95, 594 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
