Great Britain captain James Graham is the only player in the touring squad to have represented the Lions before.", "description": "After being mothballed for 12 years, the Lions returned with high hopes for their tour of New Zealand and Papua New Guinea but instead became the latest victims of the rise of Tonga.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/13/20212980-0-image-a-16_1572093601609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
