These paid leave programs allow someone to take time off from work to welcome a new child or deal with a serious personal or family illness, without worrying about whether they can afford to pay their bills.\n\nResearch suggests there are short- and long-term health benefits of taking paid leave. A newborn is at decreased risk for preterm birth, low birthweight and hospitalization, and new mothers experience increased breastfeeding rates and overall improved maternal health when they have access to paid leave. These benefits rise as length of leave increases.\n\nWhen adult children have paid time off to care for their aging parents, they face less stress balancing doctors\u2019 appointments with job responsibilities. And when some parents are faced with what may be some of the most stressful news a parent can receive \u2014 a life-threatening diagnosis for a child \u2014 paid leave allows them time to process information, make decisions, get their child out of the hospital sooner, and give comfort and care to their family.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOur families are strongest when we all have time to recover from a serious medical condition, care for a child, or care for an ill or dying family member. Too many American families, however, are unable to take time off from work without the risk of losing their jobs. Only 19 percent of employees in the United States have access to paid family leave through an employer, and just 40 percent have access to short-term disability insurance.\n\nWhile the national Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) provides some employees with the ability to take unpaid job-protected leave, approximately 40 percent of employees are ineligible due to requirements around employer size and hours worked. And even if you are eligible, you have a high chance of not being able to use FMLA anyway \u2014 46 percent of employees who are covered by FMLA and need leave say they can\u2019t afford to take time off without pay.\n\nOne might assume that this is just how the world works. But, it\u2019s not. The United States is the only high-wealth country without a national paid leave policy.\n\nInstead of creating a national standard, our country has left it up to states to pass their own paid leave laws. To its credit, California was a pioneer, passing the nation\u2019s first state paid leave policy in 2002 and establishing a successful model that other states have adopted and evolved. Thanks to California\u2019s demonstration that paid leave can help employees and their families without hurting businesses, seven additional states and the District of Columbia have passed paid family and medical leave laws. But that means 42 states still have not.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s continued dedication to ensure access to adequate and affordable paid leave is inspiring. Advocates such as the California Work & Family Coalition and state legislators, including Rep. Lorena Gonzalez and Sen. Maria Elena Durazo, continue building momentum and writing policies to strengthen and expand our state\u2019s paid leave program, calling for a more inclusive law that covers all employees, including recent immigrants.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s time we further display California\u2019s leadership on paid leave at the national level. The FAMILY Act is a national paid family and medical leave bill, modeled on California\u2019s paid leave law, that is currently before the House Ways and Means Committee with support from 197 House members and 35 senators.\n\nSome in our congressional delegation are leading the way. The rest should seize this opportunity to highlight California\u2019s leadership on this issue, co-sponsor the FAMILY Act, and work to ensure that everyone has the chance to take time off when necessary. Every employee should be able to follow their doctor\u2019s orders to stay home and rest or seek treatment without risking their ability to pay bills. Our members of Congress also should advocate for amendments to the FAMILY Act that add more progressive wage replacement, a more inclusive family definition, and stronger job protection for all.\n\nBy joining the rest of the developed world, the United States can help its residents care for their health and that of their family members without risking their income or livelihoods. Let\u2019s not squander this chance.\n\nDr. Paul J. Chung is a Los Angeles-area pediatrician who is a professor and chair of health systems science at Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine.
