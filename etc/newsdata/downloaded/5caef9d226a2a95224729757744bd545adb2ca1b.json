Instead, it was just two sets of prying eyes who got a look right at the death.\n\nThe buy and sell-side camps and their advisers - Credit Suisse and King & Wood Mallesons for the vendor and UBS, Lazard and White & Case for the acquirer - were back and forth on terms for another day or so, before the deal was signed.\n\nThe deal sees Macquarie's MIRA and investors in its Macquarie Global Infrastructure Fund III (GIF III) walk away with about $430 million, while Tasplan took $170 million off the table. The offer valued the airport's equity at about $850 million.\n\nThere was no new debt as part of the transaction, with the new owners expected to refinance the airport once they take the keys. Bankers reckons there's room for a few hundred million dollars of senior debt and another $200 million or so in capital expenditure facilities.\n\nThe transaction marks something of a hot streak for QIC's infrastructure team, led by Ross Israel,which has won a few auctions in quick succession. The manager is in pole position to acquire ASX-listed Pacific Energy and is lined up to buy SeaSwift, while it has also had its infrastructure dealmakers working on bids for Superloop and Nexus Day Hospitals recently.\n\nThe deal sees QIC and Schiphol reprise a relationship that also has them as co-investors in Brisbane Airport. QIC is Brisbane Airport Corporation's biggest shareholder with a 25 per cent stake, while Schiphol has 19.6 per cent.", "description": "QIC and Royal Schiphol have gone Dutch in their acquisition of a $600 million stake in Hobart Airport.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1793%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_46/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f99416a4b9d6c76d4620c2b86c54ef0734eef79a", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
