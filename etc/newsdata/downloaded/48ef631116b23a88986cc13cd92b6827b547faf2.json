Those claims, the company said, should have been handled as part of its bankruptcy reorganization.\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s job was to convince the Supreme Court to hear LTV\u2019s case.\n\nThe court declined, but for Ms. Warren, the issue would fester. Over a decade later, when she ran for the Senate from Massachusetts in 2012, the Republican incumbent, Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, tried to use her work for LTV against her, unleashing an ad calling her a \u201chired gun\u201d who sided \u201cagainst working people.\u201d Notwithstanding the attack, Mr. Brown lost his seat to Ms. Warren.", "description": "As Ms. Warren ascends toward the head of the Democratic presidential pack, her critics have seized upon her bankruptcy work for big corporations to question her progressive bona fides.", "authors": ["Stephanie Saul"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/multimedia/00WARBANK-01/merlin_162748782_831dd3f4-20da-4d8a-aea6-be33ba3ca937-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
