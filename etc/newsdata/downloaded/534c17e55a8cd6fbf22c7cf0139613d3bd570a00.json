They\u2019ve set their mark. They are eight points clear. They are breaking records.\n\nBut what I also saw in their performance at tigerish Huddersfield is that they can come from behind.\n\nThey were 1-0 down at the interval to a goal at the end of the first half. The home side packed numbers behind the ball and compressed space to hamper City\u2019s lightning attacking breaks.\n\nPep Guardiola's men ran out 2-1 winners against Huddersfield after Raheem Sterling's winner\n\nHowever, it won't get any easier for Manchester City as teams will adopt the Terriers' tactics\n\n13 GAMES IN, NOBODY HAS DONE IT BETTER... Manchester City\u2019s 37-point tally after 13 games is the best return in Premier League history. On Sunday, they passed their way through Huddersfield\u2019s admirable resistance, particularly in the second half. SUCCESSFUL PASSES IN SECOND HALF Huddersfield: 37 Man City: 336 And two City players completed more passes overall than Huddersfield\u2019s entire team. TOTAL SUCCESSFUL PASSES Nicolas Otamendi: 114 Fernandinho: 97 Huddersfield: 94\n\nBut Pep Guardiola\u2019s men held their nerve, they weren\u2019t rattled.\n\nThe challenge was laid down and they dealt with it. It\u2019s their first win coming from behind at half-time in an away Premier League game since April 1995, when they hit back from 2-1 down to beat Blackburn 3-2.\n\nThink about that. We know what they can do when they get ahead and blow you away, when Kevin De Bruyne is working his magic and it is all happening around him. Here they showed another side.\n\nIt\u2019s Southampton and West Ham at home next and they will expect to be just as far clear by the end of this week.\n\nTeams with more quality will, however, adopt similar tactics to Huddersfield. It\u2019s only going to get harder for City from here. It\u2019s why I can\u2019t see them finishing the season unbeaten.\n\nThe Christmas programme will give them a headache and they are determined to progress in the Champions League so they may have a hangover from a trip. And looming large on December 10 are United and Jose Mourinho.\n\nHe may have taken more than a passing interest in how Huddersfield troubled the runaway leaders.\n\nDavid Wagner's tactics against the league leaders could be mimicked by City's rivals\n\nWATFORD DISCOVERY HAS RICH PROMISE\n\nWhat an explosive start Richarlison of Watford has made. You would normally expect a young player from South America to take his time to settle. There might be flashes of his beach tricks but a manager would expect to be saying: \u2018Yes, very good, but he needs to do it more regularly... he needs to be more consistent.\u2019\n\nYou anticipate finding yourself with a luxury player who might not be as effective away from home. Watford DO have a luxury player on their books, but he\u2019s also astonishingly consistent \u2014 home and away.\n\nHe scores, he creates, he is a threat with and without the ball and he obliterated Newcastle\u2019s right side on Saturday.\n\nWatford's Richarlison is a luxury player but he's also astonishingly consistent - home and away\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not like the days when the pitches deteriorated in deep winter and form fell down like the decorations. If he continues to play like this, he will be a contender for Young Player of the Year in his debut season and Watford and their recruitment staff have done a very good job in bringing him in.\n\nHe seems to find space so easily and then uses that space to create goal chances or to score himself.\n\nHe makes it look easy. He looks to be a super talent.\n\nNo player has been involved in more away goals in the Premier League this season than Richarlison (four goals, three assists). He has had the most touches in the opposition box (93) and also won the most fouls (42).\n\nRicharlison is also the top tackling forward in the Premier League, having made 27 for Watford this season.", "description": "ALAN PARDEW: This is what Manchester City can expect now.
