The president plans to announce an executive order to protect Medicare during his visit on Thursday and to address an invitation-only group.\n\nSupport for Trump is holding firm in Florida, the largest swing state in the 2020 election with 29 electoral votes that are crucial for the president's re-election.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis and the Republican Party of Florida sent out a fundraising email in which it promised to put all donations into a newly established \"Presidential Protection Fund.\" Chairman Joe Gruters, a state senator who served as co-chair of Trump's 2016 Florida campaign, said response to the email has been \"great,\" but he said he didn't know how much money had been raised.\n\n\"When I served in Congress, I fought back against the Democrats' witch hunts every single day,\" DeSantis wrote in the email. \"I REFUSED to let them overturn the 2016 election and erase your vote from history. Now that Democrats are officially moving to impeach our duly elected president, my duty to protect him isn't over. I want the President to know that we have his back in this fight 100 per cent.\"\n\nDeSantis credits Trump for helping him win office in November and it was the president who appointed Peter O'Rourke, a candidate the governor backed, as the new executive director of the state Republican party after several months of instability.\n\nMore than 120,000 people live in The Villages, which is 55 per cent Republican. The community is mostly located in Sumter County, which supported Trump with 68 per cent of the vote in 2016, compared to 49 per cent statewide. The White House hand-picked each of the approximately 1,000 guests from a list provided to them by local GOP elected officials and party leaders, said county party chairman John Temple.\n\nDemocratic strategist Steve Schale, who ran Obama's 2008 Florida campaign and was a top Florida adviser for Obama's 2012 re-election, said it makes sense for Trump to visit The Villages during the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"It's very hard to see a scenario where he would lose Florida and win the presidency,\" Schale said. \"He's going to a friendly crowd. There aren't going to be any detractors.\"\n\nThursday will mark Trump's ninth visit to Florida this year. Most of his trips have been to his Mar-a-Lago resort, but he's also had rallies in Orlando and Panama City Beach, official visits to Miami to address Venezuelan expatriates and Lake Okeechobee to tour a waterways project. Florida is by far Trump's preferred state for rallies before appreciative crowds: He's held seven there since taking office - far more than in any other state.\n\nIn contrast to harsh criticism of the impeachment inquiry from many Florida Republicans, senator Marco Rubio has taken a more measured approach on the issue.\n\nRubio told Fox News on Wednesday that he doesn't think Trump should have brought up Biden with the Ukraine government, but on Twitter he said there shouldn't be a rush to judgment.\n\nFellow Republican Rick Scott was more pointed in his remarks, ridiculing Democrats for focusing on the inquiry instead of other issues facing the country.\n\n\"The Democrats, if Trump changes shoes, that must be an impeachable offence,\" Scott said on Fox News last week. \"I mean, every day it's just, 'Impeach him!'\"\n\n\n\nAP", "description": "Donald Trump\u00a0has told reporters at the White House he believes China should investigate Joe Biden and his son\u00a0Hunter\u00a0for corruption, speaking in blithe defiance of the impeachment inquiry already underway after he asked Ukraine for the same thing on his now-notorious 25 July call with Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Chris Riotta", "Clark Mindock", "Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/16/trump-china.jpg"}
