As prime minister, that's exactly what I will do,\" he said.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer says a government led by him would monitor for gang members attempting to enter Canada, specifically mentioning the Central American MS-13 gang. 0:38\n\nBetween January and August this year, RCMP intercepted 10,343 people entering the country from the U.S. outside legal border points, the vast majority of them at Roxham Road. That's down from 14,125 in the same period in 2018.\n\nAs part of the Conservative clampdown, Scheer said his government would hire 250 new Canada Border Services Agency officers, deploy more Immigration and Refugee Board judges to \"hotspots\" to expedite claims, and closely monitor criminal groups that pose a threat to Canada, including MS-13 gang members.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has long railed against the violent international street gang MS-13, using the threat it poses to justify the construction of a southern border wall.\n\nAsked why he was raising the spectre of MS-13, Scheer said it is crucial for law enforcement to track people with criminal backgrounds trying to enter the country.\n\n\"We want to make sure that when people come into Canada, we are putting the safety and security of Canadians first. That is paramount,\" he said.\n\nDuring a campaign event in Markham, Ont. ahead of Scheer's announcement, Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau said he's pleased that people will have an opportunity to see the infrastructure the Liberal government built to screen and process new arrivals. But he stressed there are no \"shortcuts\" in Canada's immigration system and everyone is subject to the same rules.\n\n\"There are no skipping steps with our immigration system. Everyone arriving in Canada goes through the same immigration system, a full, rigorous immigration system that is being applied,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau said Canada continues to work with partners in the U.S. and around the world to spread that message, and talks continue on a possible update to the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau says, if re-elected, his government would continue to work with the U.S. and other countries to try and stop asylum seekers from crossing the border outside of legitimate border posts. 1:46\n\nThat agreement requires that asylum seekers make their claim for protection in the first safe country they arrive in. The agreement makes an exception for those who arrive in Canada outside of official border points.\n\nTrudeau said Canadians remain in favour of immigration because they understand it benefits the economy and their communities.\n\n\"It only stays positively supported by Canadians because they have confidence that our immigration system works. And it works,\" he said.\n\nFederal Liberal leader Justin Trudeau holds a campaign event in Markham, Ont. on Wednesday October 9, 2019. (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press)\n\nScheer said he would close the \"loophole\" in the STCA by negotiating with the U.S. for a new deal that benefits both countries. Asked how he would do that if the U.S. doesn't agree, Scheer said an updated STCA is his \"preferred course of action\" but that he would also explore other options to seal the border.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said his party would suspend the STCA so that migrants would not need to to cross outside of the official border points.\n\n\"These are people that are fleeing death. They're fleeing persecution. And in the States, they're fleeing the fact that Mr. Trump has been putting kids in cages, has been stripping babies out of the arms of their mothers,\" he said.\n\n\"Of course they're afraid and they're fleeing what they know is a scary situation in the States. And so right now they have no other recourse but to cross irregularly.\"", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer\u00a0is promising to end illegal border crossings by asylum seekers entering Canada outside official points, and says his government would focus on economic immigration and protecting the most vulnerable refugees fleeing danger.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5314944.1570642152!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/scheer-roxham-road.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
