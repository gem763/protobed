SCMP\n\nA state-run Chinese newspaper faced extensive criticisms after it claimed in a Facebook post that Hong Kong protesters were planning mass terrorist attacks on September 11.\n\nChina Daily\u2019s Hong Kong edition said \u201canti-government fanatics\u201d were planning the attacks, illustrating the post with a photograph of the al-Qaeda attack on the World Trade Centre in New York.\n\nWhen asked if the claim was factually accurate and whether it was ethical to publish it, the state-run outlet sent a screenshot \u2013 which it said came from a channel on the encrypted messaging app Telegram \u2013 in which a post said protesters should start killing people if their demands were not met.\n\nThe newspaper declined to answer further questions about the paper\u2019s editorial process or why it had conflated the Hong Kong protests with the worst terrorist attack on American soil.\n\nScreengrab via SCMP\n\nThe incendiary post drew over 300 comments, with some criticising the newspaper for using the September 11 attack picture and others accusing it of spreading \u201cfake news\u201d.\n\n\u201cAre you guys making fun of the 911 tragedy? Insanely inappropriate to spread false information like this. Horribly wrong\u201d.\n\nAnother said, \u201cPlease show some respect to the people who are still suffering from the 9/11 attack, and stop this inflammatory propaganda.\u201d\n\nOn LIHKG, the Reddit-like forum used by Hong Kong protesters to organise actions, some warned that the rumours may have been created to smear the protesters.\n\nOne poster asked: \u201cEven though everyone knows it is fake, is it possible there are Chinese Communist undercover actors pretending to be protesters to stir up trouble?\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks Chinese state media has been increasingly forceful in spreading Beijing\u2019s line on the Hong Kong protests as they have become increasingly violent and evolved from opposing a now-withdrawn extradition bill to calls for an investigation into claims of police brutality and universal suffrage.\n\nThe tightly controlled outlets have also escalated the rhetoric used, comparing protesters to cockroaches and even Nazis.\n\nLast month, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube identified and removed accounts appearing to spread misinformation related to the Hong Kong protests in a \u201ccoordinated manner\u201d on their platforms. Facebook and Twitter described the actions as linked to the Chinese government. Telegram and LIHKG, both favoured by protesters, have also faced large denial of service cyberattacks.\n\nThe Facebook post also claimed that radical protesters were plotting to blow up gas pipes, start forest fires and encouraging attacks on \u201cnon-native speakers of Catonese\u201d \u2013 misspelling the most commonly spoken language in Hong Kong.\n\nMasato Kajimoto, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong specialising in news literacy and misinformation, said the \u201cinept agitprop\u201d in the China Daily post had generally been greeted with derision.\n\n\u201cState-sanctioned propaganda disguised as news reports could potentially be very effective in manipulating public opinion over time, but this particular post in question is the opposite of that,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook did not respond to questions about whether China Daily\u2019s post violated its policies. The tech giant said on its website that \u201creducing the spread of false news on Facebook is a responsibility that we take seriously,\u201d which it would counter by taking actions such as reducing the distribution of false news and removing accounts or policies that violated its standards.\n\nIn recent weeks China Daily\u2019s Hong Kong edition has also published a post on Facebook suggesting many of those taking part in the protests were actors and a video that claimed a protester had been carrying a grenade launcher \u2013 but other observers suggested that it was actually an Airsoft weapon used in a Paintball-like game.\n\nChina Daily currently runs 63 active ads on Facebook, according to the platform\u2019s Ad Library.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson declined to comment directly on the post, but said the company did not want its services to be \u201cused to spread deliberate misinformation\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe recently announced the launch of third-party fact checking in Hong Kong with our partner AFP, as part of our efforts to curb false news in Hong Kong, and we continue to look at our policies as they relate to state-owned media,\u201d the representative said.\n\nSOUTH CHINA MORNING POST\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - One commenter said it was \"insanely inappropriate to spread false information like this.
