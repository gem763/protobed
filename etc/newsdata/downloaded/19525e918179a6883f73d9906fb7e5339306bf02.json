Rita called Ken Adam\u2019s dad, Adam is Ken\u2019s daughter\u2019s son.\"\n\n\"#Corrie masterclass tonight. However Ken is Adam's Grandad not his Dad,\" added another.\n\nA third asked: \"Isn\u2019t Ken Adam\u2019s granddad not dad?\"\n\n\"Why did Rita just tell Adam that they\u2019re going to give his dad the bumps? Ken is his grandad, not his dad,\" said a fourth.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nKen and the ladies then went inside for some champagne, with Rita claiming it was \"fizz o'clock\".\n\nThe special celebrations then moved to The Rovers - where Daniel had also arranged a joint party to celebrate Bertie's first birthday early so Sinead could be there.\n\nEmotional Sinead was touched but broke down in tears as she revealed to her family she only has weeks left to live.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: SCU)\n\nEarlier in the day, Sinead and Daniel were told by the oncologist that she was not responding well to chemotherapy and did not have long left to live.\n\nThe pair headed home, leaving Ken to announce the devastating news to the rest of the pub.\n\nCorrie fans were in tears over Ken's powerful monologue, which ended with him saying that Sinead was \"the best thing that ever happened\" to Daniel, before breaking down in tears.\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridats at 7.30pm and 8.30pm on ITV", "description": "Coronation Street viewers pointed out a a major error made by Rita as Ken celebrated his 80th birthday", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Scu"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20550932.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Coronation-Street-blooper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
