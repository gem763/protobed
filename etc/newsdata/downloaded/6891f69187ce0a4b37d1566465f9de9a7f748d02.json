But is that how anybody wants to get high? By Amanda Chicago Lewis Illustrations by Party of One Photography by Silvia Razgova\n\nIt\u2019s 2019, and Big Alcohol wants in on legal pot \u2014 but only on its own terms. One by one, the largest beer companies in the world have announced their intention to create drinkable marijuana products. So brace yourself for an onslaught of alcohol-free weed beers and weed seltzers and weed fruit punches.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: no one really wants or likes cannabis beverages. In legal adult-use marijuana markets, infused beverages make up a mere 2 to 3 percent of total sales. But the alcohol industry really and truly believes it can convince us that we want to consume weed the same way we consume alcohol, gulp by gulp. Molson Coors CEO Mark Hunter has said drinks could soon make up 20 to 30 percent of cannabis sales. That\u2019s right: he thinks he can increase demand for marijuana beverages by a factor of 10.\n\nLast year, Molson Coors took a controlling stake in a joint venture with a licensed pot producer in Canada called HEXO. Anheuser-Busch InBev put $50 million toward a similar joint venture with the British Columbia-based Tilray. Heineken-owned Lagunitas already sells a hop-flavored, pot-infused sparkling water at California marijuana dispensaries, in partnership with Sonoma\u2019s CannaCraft. And Constellation Brands, which includes Corona and Modelo, threw down nearly $4 billion \u2014 the biggest investment in the history of weed \u2014 on a 38 percent stake in the largest Canadian marijuana producer, Canopy Growth.\n\nBeing high doesn\u2019t feel the same as being drunk\n\nFull disclosure: I\u2019ve always found drinks to be the worst kind of marijuana edible. Even if you find one that doesn\u2019t taste like bong water, the absent-minded ease of sipping almost guarantees you\u2019ll have too much, and the delayed intensity that\u2019s left so many people wary of edible weed means that it could hit you all at once, two hours later. Unless, of course, it\u2019s a low-dose product, and then you might have too little. I\u2019ve been smoking about a joint a night for the past decade or so, and I need 25\u201330 milligrams of THC to get high. Most pot drinks are aimed either at serious, all-day stoners, with 100 milligrams of THC per bottle, or at entry-level lightweights, with 2.5 milligrams of THC per bottle. I love weed, but I don\u2019t want to stop myself after a third of an iced tea, and I don\u2019t want to have to down 10 iced teas. Marijuana tolerance varies far more than alcohol tolerance, and that makes it much harder to create shareable, standardized products.\n\nAs it exists now, the whole cannabis beverage category is a mess. Even if you can get the dosage and the taste and the onset timing correct, being high doesn\u2019t feel the same as being drunk. Why should we try to force marijuana to mimic the experience of alcohol? Are the makers of Blue Moon and Stella Artois hoping that, 10 years from now, bars and ball games will offer both a weed beer and regular beer?\n\nI tried to push past the sunny investor forecasts and check it all out for myself: the mega-companies in Canada burning up shareholder cash; the shrewd entrepreneurs in California who are still getting used to following laws; and the thriving illicit market that offers lower quality for cheap, undercutting the entire legalization endeavor from Toronto to Detroit to Los Angeles. With the goal of doing some crucial investigative weed-beverage journalism, I tasted nasty concoctions, spent 12 hours pot party-hopping at Coachella, messed up a friend\u2019s romantic rendezvous by getting her too stoned, ventured to an isolated factory town in Canada, and got myself super high on marijuana wine on a night that ended with a $62 snack shopping spree.\n\n\u201cHow many different ways do we have to get high? It\u2019s a little stupid.\u201d\n\nI discovered the reality is that Big Beer is going after pot drinks because its own industry has been in slow, steady decline for two decades. First, cocktails and wine grew more accessible, chipping away at beer\u2019s market share. Then, craft breweries led a revolution against domestic lager juggernauts like Budweiser and Miller Lite. Now, with Americans increasingly concerned about the negative health implications of drinking and legalized cannabis poised to take a huge bite out of the recreational intoxication consumer spending pie, giant beer companies are trying to maintain their lucrative dominance over how we turn up and wind down.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a beverage company and you know how to make liquid and put it in cans and make it taste good, whether it\u2019s an electrolyte beer or a THC beer, it\u2019s a natural extension of your expertise,\u201d says Brandy Rand, chief operating officer for the Americas at IWSR Drinks Market Analytics, an alcohol industry market research firm. Rand told me she thinks the expansion into marijuana-infused beverages makes perfect sense for alcohol companies. \u201cThis is a natural progression into looking at people who are concerned about wellness, who maybe want the occasion and experience of something that looks, tastes, and feels like a beverage alcohol product but has no calories, no hangover.\u201d\n\nBut of course Rand feels that way. She works for a company that sells information and projections to alcohol conglomerates who are eager for a solution to the challenges posed by legal cannabis. Analysts on the weed side aren\u2019t quite so optimistic about pot drinks. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a novelty that wears off pretty quickly,\u201d says Matt Karnes, founder of the cannabis financial firm GreenWave Advisors. \u201cHow many different ways do we have to get high? It\u2019s a little stupid.\u201d\n\nThis is what\u2019s so wild about marijuana legalization. Everything is still up in the air, and things are moving fast. We can\u2019t even predict all of the industries legal pot will disrupt or fundamentally alter. Sleep aids? Painkillers? Tourism? Data from the first states to allow recreational use show that more people are willing to give the drug a try once it\u2019s legal. The tantalizing and possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to entice and convert more people into cannabis consumers has businesses hustling to innovate neophyte-friendly offerings \u2014 hence the eight-figure investments in building a better weed drink. \u201cBeverages should have a meaningful opportunity, if you can fix the product,\u201d says Vivien Azer, the lead cannabis analyst at the investment bank Cowen.\n\nMaybe cannabis drinks really are going to be the next kombucha, and not the next New Coke\n\nBut as with other vice industries like casinos or tobacco, the majority of weed sales remain concentrated among the heaviest users, creating a conundrum for anyone looking to sell marijuana beverages: develop a high-dose product for the market you have, or develop a low-dose product for the market you want? Much of the money aimed at the speculative, mainstream market is going to Canada where marijuana-infused beverages and other edibles will become available this December, giving corporate beer companies a chance to experiment in the Great White North before debuting anything on a global stage.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m part of the existing cannabis market, and so I don\u2019t totally understand what might motivate the people who are only now considering trying weed for the first time or coming back to it after some years away. Perhaps people will find drinking THC to be more clean, appealing, and healthy than vaping oil or smoking pot. Pipes can be gross. Bongs can be intimidating. So with as open a mind as possible, I set off this spring to see what\u2019s out there and what\u2019s coming, in a bid to determine whether pot drinks could be the future of inebriation.\n\nMaybe cannabis drinks really are going to be the next kombucha, and not the next New Coke. I\u2019m willing to believe that a slew of corporations can figure out what we want before we do. I\u2019m willing to try a weed beverage that tastes and feels better than the crap I\u2019ve had after six years as a marijuana industry reporter and a decade living in Los Angeles. I\u2019m just also cognizant of the fact that hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted on dumber ideas before.\n\nThe oldest operating marijuana beverage brand in the country is also, for now, the best-selling one. It\u2019s called the Cannabis Quencher, a line of juices and lemonades in flavors like hibiscus and strawberry that have been sold in California for the past eight years by the company VCC Brands. I\u2019ve always hated Cannabis Quenchers, which taste too sweet and usually contain a whopping 100mg of THC. But I decided that in order to understand where pot drinks are going, I need to spend some time with someone who understands where they\u2019ve been.\n\nWhen I call up VCC Brands founder Kenny Morrison, this intention morphs into a plan to drive his Subaru out to the desert and cruise through Southern California\u2019s greatest annual drug-fueled party scene: Coachella. After all, if there\u2019s one place on Earth that can predict which intoxicants are going to be cool in the coming years, it\u2019s Indio in mid-April when the youth of the world gather to pose and preen and get fucked up.\n\nAt 44, Morrison embodies a very Hollywood idea of a white man in Los Angeles: surfer, actor, weed mogul. (As a child, he starred in The NeverEnding Story sequel.) He is tan year-round, with a five o\u2019clock shadow and a confident, disarming charm. As we drive, he often changes lanes without signaling.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2018, Morrison operated his commercial cannabis kitchen between 4PM and 1AM because it was illicit and he assumed food inspectors didn\u2019t work after hours. Over the years, he\u2019s put pot into everything from bagel bites to biscotti, caramels to coconut water. When he first began looking into beverages in 2010, he hired a food scientist who made him swear to keep his involvement a secret.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018Where should we start? Iced tea? Lemonade?\u2019\u201d Morrison recalls. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Here\u2019s the difference: If lemonade goes bad, it\u2019ll give someone a stomachache. Maybe they\u2019ll throw up. But if you do an iced tea wrong, that will kill your customer,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Let\u2019s start with lemonade!\u2019\u201d\n\nEven though marijuana is technically not allowed on Coachella\u2019s grounds, the surrounding desert is a hot spot for industrial cannabis production. This year, there were weed-sponsored shindigs aplenty. During a single Friday, we managed to see the full range of Golden State pot culture: the Johnny-come-latelies with tons of money, the ex-criminals scrambling to scale up, and the people operating on the edges of what is legal.\n\nMorrison belongs to the second group. After securing $5\u201315 million from an investor this spring, he is now gunning to compete with Molson Coors and InBev.\n\n\u201cFuck them and their insights,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cSome insights can be bought, but many insights come with experience.\u201d\n\nWe pull off the freeway in an exurban wasteland of pavement, dust, and fast food. Our first stop is a marijuana dispensary where a new low-dose weed beer called Two Roots is targeting festivalgoers with THC-free samples from a bicycle-operated kegerator. Two Roots has supposedly solved the biggest problem with existing pot drinks: the fact that it takes so long to get high.\n\n\u201cImagine if you had to wait an hour and a half to feel the impact of scotch,\u201d says Charlie Bachtell, the CEO of Cresco Labs, which partners with Two Roots in Nevada. Apparently, marijuana edibles feel more intense than smoking because your liver metabolizes the THC differently, converting it into a stronger, more psychedelic form. The secret to Two Roots is water-soluble THC, which skips your liver, producing a cannabis libation that hits quickly and lightly and doesn\u2019t linger in your system.\n\nOutside the desert pot shop, Kevin Love (not the NBA player, just a guy from New Jersey with vocal fry), \u201cdirector of market activations\u201d at Two Roots\u2019 parent company, offers a paper cup of lager to a woman with pink hair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good, actually,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWow, really?\u201d he responds.\n\nLove started Two Roots\u2019 parent company after stints at JPMorgan and the Royal Bank of Canada. He raised $19 million from friends and family.\n\nThree gruff-looking biker types approach. \u201cThis is not our typical demo,\u201d Love says under his breath, but the guys each take a sample. \u201cThat\u2019s not bad,\u201d one says. When they turn to go, Love says, \u201cWe\u2019re lucky we didn\u2019t get roughed up!\u201d He is similarly disapproving when a black man with gold front teeth walks up, the last inch of a blunt hanging out of his mouth.\n\nJust as I\u2019m starting to wonder who will both want to try Two Roots and be found worthy by Love, his ideal customer arrives: a middle-aged white woman with red glasses. Her husband brews. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine a beer with THC,\u201d she says. \u201cIt sounds like the perfect drink!\u201d\n\nAs we pull away, Morrison scoffs. He knows about water-soluble THC, too. \u201cIt\u2019s not that hard,\u201d he says, explaining that the bigger hurdle is finding the right emulsifier. Indeed, at our next event, which is hosted by an old friend of Morrison\u2019s, bartenders are combining bottled cocktail mixers with either alcohol or emulsified CBD. It\u2019s a party for a vape pen company that started out as illegal and is now trying to attract funding. Nestled in a hillside, the mansion they rented for the weekend provides expansive views of the valley, and though not many people have shown yet, all of the elements of a Coachella party startup kit are here: chips, guac, DJ, infinity pool, white furniture, and at least one gold inflatable swan. Women in bikini tops lounge on straw-woven cushions, smoking joints.\n\n\u201cThis party is all about brand awareness,\u201d says Olivia Wagner, the event planner, who is stunning and blonde and has some kind of light-catching crystal affixed to her tooth. \u201cWe\u2019re having talent coming tomorrow at 2 because that\u2019s when the investors are coming,\u201d she says, name-dropping a few rappers, an actress, and one A-lister who I would be shocked to see here. \u201cTons of the Vice guys are coming out,\u201d she continues. Okay, that I believe.\n\nAs we\u2019re driving away, Morrison seems disoriented.\n\n\u201cWhen she says \u2018lifestyle brand,\u2019 you want to punch her in the face,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she was crushing it. Creating good-looking photography, all the stock shit you\u2019re supposed to have. It just feels satirical because of the stark change we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s true. Since 2017, Morrison has gone from an outlaw who once had a million dollars seized from his bank accounts to a poster boy for legalization. But when we show up at our final event, an LA Weekly party at a Moroccan-themed hotel, it becomes clear that despite the flood of new laws and new money and new pot shops that look like Apple Stores, the free-for-all energy of an earlier era lives on.\n\n\u201cIt should be emulsified. This dude\u2019s a rookie.\u201d\n\nAfter some drama over whether we are On The List, we make our way down a stone-tiled pathway, past magenta Bougainvillea and a woman in camo pants, a red bra, and gold hoops who is staring at her phone on an inflatable bird of paradise-print chair. Since late 2017 when a mysterious, marijuana-connected group bought LA Weekly and fired almost the entire staff, the local rag has abandoned journalism in favor of pablum and weed ads. (Disclosure: I wrote for a very different LA Weekly from 2011\u20132014.) For Coachella, the publication was hosting a raucous pool party and a cannabis competition. Eventually, we find the man in charge: weed writer Jimi Devine, who is wearing a tie-dye shirt and has frizzy hair down to his chest. Devine is quite high, having posted up for the weekend with the rest of the judges to try every single entrant of pot, edible, oil, preroll, drink, and vape pen.\n\nAt Devine\u2019s insistence, I had agreed to help judge a few categories, including beverages, so he whisks me into his hotel room where marijuana products cover almost every surface.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even going to give you the Marley Natural because it\u2019s so bad,\u201d Devine says. Sure, I think, that sounds fair.\n\nSome of the bud is in plastic baggies, which means it hasn\u2019t been packaged according to state law. Less than one-fifth of the marijuana industry in California is legal. In Los Angeles, only 186 of the city\u2019s estimated 1,700 storefront dispensaries are licensed.\n\nWhen we get back in the car, Morrison recalls that he had to explain to the LA Weekly representative that the only legal way to obtain Cannabis Quenchers for the judges was at a licensed dispensary.\n\nOne hand on the steering wheel, Morrison looks through his competition: a beer, a lemonade, and a pomegranate green tea. He holds the lemonade up to the light, drifting across the yellow double lines.\n\n\u201cSee how it sticks to the top?\u201d he says. \u201cIt should be emulsified. This dude\u2019s a rookie.\u201d\n\nLater, after I pour this super potent lemonade into a glass to try the tiniest sip, I write on the judge\u2019s form that it looks like milk mixed with urine.\n\nA few weeks after immersing myself in the thirsty, cannabis-sponsored ragers of Coachella, I head to the opposite end of the legal weed universe where there are millions of dollars in R&D but not much glamour: rural Canada. I\u2019m there to check out the most advanced marijuana drink development that money can buy at the Canopy Growth Corporation. The company\u2019s 70-acre headquarters is about an hour outside of Ottawa in a town called Smiths Falls, where there are no actual waterfalls.\n\nOn paper, Canopy is the most valuable legal weed firm in the world, with contracts in every Canadian province and a medical presence in Australia, Germany, Brazil, and more. It trades on the New York Stock Exchange. It recently announced a $3.4 billion plan to acquire the marijuana firm that has former Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner on the board. And it\u2019s using the $3.8 billion from the alcohol company Constellation Brands to expand at top speed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s trees on the lawn now,\u201d says Carly Picket, one of the employees touring me around. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a week ago.\u201d\n\nBefore this property was a legal pot behemoth with over 3,000 employees, it was a Hershey\u2019s factory and tourist destination. In that spirit, Canopy often takes investors and media on a cheery, Potemkin-seeming \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d tour, past busy-looking scientists in safety goggles, and across catwalks that overlook manufacturing space. We suit up in white coats and blue booties and peek into the clone room, the mother plant room, the flowering rooms, the vegetative rooms. We talk about temperature controls, humidity controls, light controls, automated trimmers, human trimmers, this technology, that technology, whatever. It\u2019s weed. Canopy is growing it on an industrial scale, but so are lots of people these days. The company\u2019s yield per plant is less than half of what other cultivators can produce, especially in California.\n\nThe Canopy people seem a little unnerved that I\u2019m not impressed and that I\u2019ve seen several large-scale grows like this before. At a certain point, it comes out that the company\u2019s truly massive grows are in another province entirely, in greenhouses, which are much more cost-efficient. Later, over lunch, I ask corporate communications manager Caitlin O\u2019Hara whether Canopy is looking into the lesser-known compounds in the cannabis plant. A lot of pot companies are especially interested in the fatigue-inducing cannabinol (CBN) as a potential alternative to Ambien, but O\u2019Hara says she\u2019s never heard of it. She decides to start asking me questions: specifically, which companies should Canopy be looking to acquire in California?\n\n\u201cBefore Red Bull, there was nothing like it. That\u2019s what this looks like.\u201d\n\nIn the past few years, California and Canada have emerged as the global pot economy\u2019s two gravitational poles, eyeing each other from across the border with a certain degree of mistrust and resentment. While California has the customers and the expertise, Canada has the backing of a major government and therefore the big money. After Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau prioritized legalization in 2015, Canadian financial services picked up a huge advantage in the cannabis space. So even though the entire Canadian marijuana market is worth less than the Los Angeles market, all of the serious weed investors are going to Canada or through Canada. In the five years since the Canadian Securities Exchange began allowing marijuana firms, its combined market cap has gone from $5 billion to over $30 billion \u2014 a Green Rush frenzy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to determine if these companies are fairly valued,\u201d explains Mitch Baruchowitz, the managing partner of cannabis investment firm Merida. Until last year, there were only about 30 companies licensed to both sell and grow pot in Canada, so when corporations like Altria (formerly Philip Morris) and Constellation went looking for legal partners, there weren\u2019t that many choices. The situation is often described as a bubble, and I\u2019m wondering whether Canopy can live up to the hype.\n\nBecause edibles aren\u2019t legal yet in Canada, Canopy won\u2019t let me try its pot beverages, which are supposed to hit within 15\u201320 minutes and will likely include an iced tea, a kombucha, a lemonade, and a sparkling water that tastes like pine needles.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to create a category,\u201d says VP of communications Jordan Sinclair. \u201cBefore Red Bull, there was nothing like it. That\u2019s what this looks like. It fills a new need.\u201d\n\nNothing about Canopy\u2019s new weed drinks is quite final, though. More regulations are coming, so the company is putting everything together in a preliminary way \u2014 all without knowing what consumers will actually like.\n\n\u201cYou are making decisions, expensive decisions, without the full details, and so there\u2019s a lot of pivots,\u201d says Mark Zekulin, one of the company\u2019s two CEOs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just an empty box.\u201d\n\nStill, production forges forward. Last November, shortly after Canopy announced the multibillion-dollar investment from Constellation, the company began work on a bottling factory down the street from the grow rooms and the visitor\u2019s center. On our way there, O\u2019Hara brings me to the company\u2019s regional distribution center, where Josh Shaver, the logistics guy in charge, tells me, \u201cWe consider this the world\u2019s largest cannabis warehouse!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 is it?\u201d I ask. \u201cThe largest?\u201d\n\nThey have no idea.\n\nFinally, we reach the bottling factory, which remains under construction. We don steel toe boots, orange hazard vests, safety glasses, and hard hats before we can get near the building. It\u2019s a huge structure, about 120,000 square feet. Outside, Mack cement mixers beep past John Deere bulldozers. We duck in a cutout where a door might go and see that the inside is filled with small rocks. O\u2019Hara has never been to this building, and she seems thrilled to be checking it out.\n\n\u201cSo is this the office?\u201d she asks. It is, but there are not yet walls or floors or anything resembling an office, really. \u201cWow, this is incredible,\u201d she continues, as we walk into another part of the barren, capacious structure. I have to give her credit for keeping up this level of awe.\n\n\u201cThe impressive thing is the speed at which PCL is getting this all done,\u201d says Kevin Garnett (again, not the NBA player, just the crusty project manager). PCL is the construction firm, and they are working almost twice as fast as normal.\n\nWe walk around the vacant space for a few minutes in near silence. There\u2019s a guy wielding a blowtorch in the corner, and a few men are scattered on scissor lifts throughout, working on the ceiling. But mostly, it feels quiet and immense and expensive, like a cathedral. Except instead of frescoes, I realize, there would soon be rows and rows of monumental contraptions shuttling flavored liquid weed in elegant glass bottles to and fro. I tried to imagine a world where I meet my friends for a drink on a Friday at that Mexican place I like, and while they sip mezcal, I slowly get stoned in the sunshine on some pine needle-flavored seltzer, manufactured right here in this room and shipped legally to Los Angeles. For now, though, it was all just a promise, a projection of what some future reality could hold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just an empty box,\u201d Garnett says, and I nod because he\u2019s correct.\n\nTwo months after I visit, Canopy\u2019s board votes to oust one of its two CEOs, reportedly because the company was spending far more money than it took in.\n\nAt long last, a few days before the pot holiday 4/20, I have the opportunity to get soused on some weed wine in Napa, California. A tenacious cannabis PR woman, Cynthia Salarizadeh, had teamed up with wine industry veteran Tracey Mason to create House of Saka, a marijuana-infused, alcohol-removed ros\u00e9 made with water-soluble THC. So of course they are throwing a 75-person dinner at a Victorian ranch in wine country to celebrate.\n\nThe ranch is in the middle of nowhere, and in the car on the way over, Salarizadeh is freaking out. Apparently, CNBC was supposed to send a camera crew, but two days ago, the cable network canceled on her.\n\n\u201cIn all my years of PR, I\u2019ve never seen something so unprofessional,\u201d she fumes. \u201cWe dropped 40 Gs on this thing!\u201d\n\nNow, she\u2019s nervous about everything. She\u2019s worried the wine will look too cloudy because it\u2019s natural and unfiltered. She\u2019s worried it will taste like pot. She\u2019s worried no one is going to show up. She\u2019s worried her eyebrows look weird.\n\nWe get there, and it\u2019s beautiful, the sunlight streaming across the stained glass of the converted dairy barn. Each glass of Saka contains about 5 milligrams of THC, so when I get my first drink from the bar, I tell myself I can have five or six over the course of the night. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste bad!\u201d I say, after my first sip. Another woman says she can taste the weed, but I can\u2019t at all. A guy comes by with scallops on a cracker, and, all at once, it\u2019s cocktail hour and people start to arrive.\n\nI run into the slippery and ubiquitous political consultant Sean Donahoe, with his shaggy hair and his rectangular glasses, and he tells me he really enjoys getting stoned by drinking. \u201cBeverages have a bubbly high,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like drinking champagne with a codeine kicker.\u201d When I express some skepticism that the trend will ever catch on, he reminds me that there are non-smoking, edible-only cannabis social spaces opening in West Hollywood sometime in the next year: \u201cThat\u2019s made for beverages!\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019m two glasses in, Salarizadeh introduces me to Ned Fussell, one of the founders of the Sonoma-based cannabis company CannaCraft, the company that partnered with Lagunitas on a hop-flavored, marijuana-infused sparkling water called HiFi Hops. Fussell is a scrappy lifelong pot grower from Worcester, Massachusetts. In the past decade, he and his co-founder have built CannaCraft into a major force in the California market, with 250 employees and a suite of successful brands. Salarizadeh was in talks to distribute Saka through CannaCraft.\n\nSoon, it\u2019s time for dinner, and as we take our seats under the chandeliers and exposed beams in a room that looks like a spiffed-up frontier saloon, I ask Fussell to level with me: is anyone really buying HiFi Hops? I mean, does anyone actually want a sparkling water that tastes like beer and gets you high?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the number one carbonated weed beverage in California!\u201d he says cheekily. (There are hardly any carbonated weed beverages at California dispensaries.)\n\nJeff Henderson, the HiFi Hops brand manager, sits down next to us. \u201cWe sold out in the two dispensaries we\u2019re in, in San Francisco,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cTwelve bottles!\u201d Fussell jokes.\n\nIt\u2019s around this point that I realize I\u2019m having a good time. I feel nicely buzzed and somewhat reassured that the people behind a product I\u2019d found ridiculous also weren\u2019t taking it too seriously. We\u2019re eating a colorful lettuce salad with marigold flowers, and shaved watermelon radishes, when Karen Hamilton, Lagunitas\u2019 director of community relations, walks up, in a horizontal-striped cotton maxi-dress, with a glass of Saka in one hand and a glass of red in the other.\n\n\u201cDouble-fisting?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cWell, I wanted to try this,\u201d \u2014 the weed wine, she means \u2014 \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t sure how much I\u2019d like the flavor, so I got a back-up.\u201d She likes the way it tastes, though. \u201cIt has a tartness I like, like a lemon, or a Marlborough sauvignon blanc.\u201d\n\nNot long after this, I realize I\u2019ve lost track of how many glasses I\u2019ve had and that I\u2019ve missed the lemon ricotta ravioli entirely. I worry I\u2019m about to get too stoned, but the vibes are good, so I go with it. I grab some of the braised pork shoulder before it gets cold because the roasted halibut already is. At Fussell\u2019s urging, I try a bottle of HiFi Hops, or maybe two. Then I see Yvonne DeLaRosa Green and her husband Sam, the effervescent hippie owners of a cannabis shop in Malibu. Green is wearing a drapey pink pearl-studded shawl, and she tells me they don\u2019t stock beverages.\n\n\u201cWe had them before. What happened?\u201d she asks her husband.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t selling as well,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cI think the milligrams were too high,\u201d she says, but she wants to start carrying Saka.\n\nSomeone makes an announcement about a dessert bar, and I find Donahoe again, nursing a regular beer.\n\n\u201cIs this what it\u2019s going to be like all summer?\u201d he asks wistfully. \u201cHigh-end events?\u201d I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s somehow sad about how fancy this party is or just experiencing the same kind of whiplash that had left Morrison so unsettled.\n\n\u201cIt tastes like someone put hops in Natty Light, and I\u2019d rather be drinking Natty Light.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, it\u2019s 9:25PM, and Salarizadeh\u2019s shoes are off. She looks much more relaxed than she did on the way over here. Nearby, an older couple is getting freaky on the dance floor.\n\nI start talking to a guy in a tweedy jacket who owns a company that removes the alcohol from wine and beer and liquor \u2014 a key factor in all this, since every place with legal weed does not allow you to mix cannabis and alcohol in the same product. He tells me he had quit using marijuana entirely, but beverages had brought him back.\n\n\u201cThese are light, but it comes on fast, enough to feel it,\u201d he says. In this moment, I know exactly what he\u2019s talking about: you feel the acceleration, most, when you\u2019re getting intoxicated, so the ramp-up has to be quick but not too steep. Classic pot drinks like the Cannabis Quencher come on too strong, and too fast, long after the instinct to get high has dissipated. But this \u2014 this is great. The profound fog that I\u2019d been bracing for had never come on. My night of drinking weed was\u2026 actually really enjoyable.\n\nOf course, one good night does not an industry make. And remember: I\u2019m someone who already likes the feeling of being stoned.\n\nOn another night, I bring a four-pack of that low-dose Two Roots product to a dinner party of cannabis-curious women, and it doesn\u2019t go well. As one friend tries to pop the child-proof tab, the weed beer squirts in her face. Another tries to pour hers into a glass and ends up needing to crush the can to get all of the liquid out. \u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d she observes, then takes a sip. \u201cIt tastes like someone put hops in Natty Light,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019d rather be drinking Natty Light.\u201d\n\nInstead of hitting within 15 minutes and wearing off within an hour and a half, as promised, the Two Roots leaves one of my friends intensely high for over four hours. The date she goes on later that evening, with a hot guy from out of town, does not go well.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t at all unpleasant,\u201d she texts later, as I apologize for ruining her night. \u201cI can imagine if I was home alone being like, \u2018I\u2019ll drink that and go to bed.\u2019 But I wouldn\u2019t do it socially for the same reason I don\u2019t smoke weed socially. It\u2019s just the wrong mix.\u201d\n\nI realize she\u2019s right. With alcohol, everything speeds up, and the distance between yourself and other people seems to shrink. With marijuana, the world slows down, and a light-hearted haze creeps over you, defamiliarizing reality. The experiences are not interchangeable. The people who can\u2019t handle being stoned in public are not going to suddenly learn how. And until they do, the mainstream popularity of pot drinks is going to remain, well, a pipe dream.\n\nCorrection: Kevin Love\u2019s title has been updated.
