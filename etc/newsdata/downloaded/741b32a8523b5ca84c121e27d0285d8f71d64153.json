When she asked them to move, they reportedly dismissed her.\n\n\"If a mum with 3 kids and bags has 4 reserved seats for a long train journey, and you're sitting in their seats on a full carriage, don't tell them that their tickets don't matter in a posh voice and then say you're not moving and refuse to make eye contact,\" Mancino-Williams tweeted. \"Don't be these people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a mum with 3 kids and bags has 4 reserved seats for a long train journey, and you're sitting in their seats on a full carriage, don't tell them that their tickets don't matter in a posh voice and then say you're not moving and refuse to make eye contact. Don't be these people. pic.twitter.com/0JnnyLfalv \u2014 A Mancino-Williams (@Manda_like_wine) October 22, 2019\n\nAlong with the initial tweet, the mother attached a photo of the couple, who look away from the camera. Mancino-Williams also included a photo of her three children sitting across from the couple in a follow-up tweet. All three appear expressionless as they attempt to share two seats.\n\nFortunately, another passenger offered his seat to the family before the train conductor intervened to move Mancino-Williams and her children to an empty table in first class.\n\n\"A kind man offered me his seat,\" the mother tweeted. \"Spoke to conductor who was calm, lovely, and apologetic, said that instead of engaging with them that he was going to move us to an empty table in first class. I grabbed our bags and turned to the couple and said, with a smile, 'enjoy your seats!'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA kind man offered me his seat.

I've been getting requests for statements and just wanted to say a few things. This situation is not about my children not having manners enough to stand for the elderly. This is about a culture of bullying and entitlement. \u2014 A Mancino-Williams (@Manda_like_wine) October 23, 2019\n\n\"My kids and I were being fair and following rules and these two were not,\" she continued. \"They immediately switched into bully mode as they saw us approach, clearly aware that those seats were ours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMy kids and I were being fair and following rules and these two were not. They immediately switched into bully mode as they saw us approach, clearly aware that those seats were ours. Many of you have written to me having experienced the same, and I'm trying to read through all. \u2014 A Mancino-Williams (@Manda_like_wine) October 23, 2019", "description": "A pregnant mother took to Twitter to criticize an elderly couple for refusing to move\u00a0from the train seats she had reserved for her children.", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2Jjofj3crOgagvkKV_ibRQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2621x1717+188+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a5554a90-f68e-11e9-9f37-4c7849a208b3", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
