Zarif replied, \u201cAn all-out war.\u201d In his follow up statement, Zarif said Iran doesn\u2019t want war but added, \u201cWe won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u201d Of course, Zarif is holding to the party line, i.e. the claim that Iran had nothing to do with the attack.\n\nHe again denied that Iran was involved in weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, which dramatically ratcheted up tensions in the region. Zarif said Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who claimed responsibility for the attack, have stepped up their military capabilities and were capable of conducting a sophisticated operation such as the one that knocked out half of the kingdom\u2019s energy production. Probed further, however, Zarif was unable to provide proof that Houthis launched the drones and missiles. \u201cI cannot have any confidence that they did it because we just heard their statement,\u201d said Zarif. \u201cI know that we didn\u2019t do it. I know that the Houthis made a statement that they did it.\u201d\n\nYes, we all know what the Houthi\u2019s claimed. The problem for Zarif is that some of the cruise missiles used in the attack didn\u2019t make it to their destination and crashed, still mostly intact, in the desert. Those missiles are Iranian designs. The only way Houthi rebels in Yemen would have them is if Iran gave them to them. The Saudi Ministry of Defense put the recovered parts of the missile and several UAV\u2019s used in the attack on display yesterday.\n\nU.S. officials have also confirmed that the attack was launched in Iran, not in Yemen. So what you have here is Iran making another provocative attack on the world\u2019s oil supply and then lying about it and daring anyone to do something about it.\n\nPresident Trump doesn\u2019t seem to have any interest in escalating this into a military conflict, but given the facts here it\u2019s hard to see how Saudi Arabia can ignore this. Oil production represents about 90 percent of the Saudi economy. This attack briefly crippled more than half of the nation\u2019s total oil production. About half of that lost production has already been restored and the rest is expected to be back to normal within a few weeks. Still, this was a significant attack on the country. The Saudi\u2019s must be thinking that if Iran is given a pass this time, they\u2019re very likely to try it again.\n\nMeanwhile, here in the U.S., the blame-America-first crowd is already swinging into action. As Jazz noted this morning, Tim Kaine has somehow concluded that President Trump is to blame for the Iranian attack on Saudi Arabia. Elizabeth Warren said the other night on Stephen Colbert\u2019s show that there wasn\u2019t enough proof Iran was responsible for us to respond. Of course, that\u2019s exactly what Iran is relying on, i.e. that if they can cloud the issue just enough the anti-Trump elements here at home will shriek over any reaction to Iran\u2019s behavior. So far, it seems to be working for Iran but the threats about \u201call-out war\u201d sound a lot more like desperation than strength.\n\nHere\u2019s the interview with Zarif:", "description": "\"We won't blink to defend our territory.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Hot Air Staff", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Zarif.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
