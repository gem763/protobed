A decision by Fort Collins, Colorado not to challenge a 2-1 10th Circuit ruling that struck down ordinances against topless women in their city has the impact of striking down similar statutes across six states. It might be late in the season, but the Free the Nipple movement can celebrate the win in their preferred style in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming as well as the Rocky Mountain state:\n\nFort Collins, Colorado, decided not to continue its challenge to a federal court\u2019s decision that a ban on going topless in the city amounts to unconstitutional discrimination, NBC News reported. The city had argued that a repeal of the ban would lead to women \u201cparading in front of elementary schools or swimming topless in the public pool,\u201d according to the report. The city decided not to appeal the decision this month after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the legal battle already, NBC reported. The decision to not move forward with the appeal effectively legalizes the practice in the six states covered by the 10th Circuit court, according to the report.\n\nJazz covered the 10th Circuit\u2019s ruling back in February, but it\u2019s worth revisiting again after Fort Collins\u2019 surrender. The court ruled that the ordinance barring female toplessness had no other rational basis than gender discrimination. The city had argued that exposed female breasts had an \u201cinherently sexual nature,\u201d which raised \u201cmyriad concerns\u201d about public order if unrestricted toplessness was adopted. As the ruling notes, the city outlined a few of those concerns:\n\nThe officials testified that female toplessness could disrupt public order, lead to distracted driving, and endanger children. Citing these concerns, the City claims that prohibiting only female toplessness serves to protect children from public nudity, to maintain public order, and to promote traffic safety.\n\nNeedless to say, the traffic safety argument didn\u2019t carry the day. Instead, the court panel blamed \u201cnegative stereotypes\u201d about the female breast for gender discrimination:\n\nWe\u2019re left, as the district court was, to suspect that the City\u2019s professed interest in protecting children derives not from any morphological differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s breasts but from negative stereotypes depicting women\u2019s breasts, but not men\u2019s breasts, as sex objects.\n\nOne can endlessly debate whether the sexual allure of women\u2019s breasts are a negative, let alone a \u201cstereotype\u201d in the sense that it falsely portrays reality. The vast experience of human sexuality seems to clearly indicate that women\u2019s breasts contribute to their sexual allure far more than men\u2019s breasts to to theirs. In his dissent, Judge Harris Hartz notes that gender-discrimination laws and precedents traditionally apply where there are no rational differences between the sexes. The Fort Collins ordinance does not irrationally discriminate, Hartz wrote, but follows a long line of public-indecency laws that necessarily deal with rational physical differences between the sexes:\n\nIt is part of a long tradition of laws prohibiting public indecency\u2014the public display of portions of the anatomy that are perceived as particularly erotic or serve an excretory function. These laws may be justified as reducing or preventing antisocial behavior caused by indecent exposure: offensive behavior ranging from assault to corruption of youth to simply distraction from productive activity. The Ordinance does not discriminate against women on the basis of any overbroad generalization about their perceived \u201ctalents, capacities, or preferences.\u201d To the extent it distinguishes between the sexes, it is based on inherent biological, morphological differences between them. Those differences are not stereotypes. They are not statistical differences, they are not matters of degree. They are differences in anatomical structure that reflect the unique biological roles played by males and females. (Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cevidence\u201d that the breasts of men and women are essentially identical cannot be taken seriously.) We are not dealing here with a \u201csimplistic, outdated assumption that gender could be used as a proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.\u201d Mississippi University for Women, 458 U.S. at 726 (internal quotation marks omitted). And, to go back to first principles in equal-protection jurisprudence, there is nothing inherently invidious to an adult of either gender in declaring that an inherent biological, morphological feature of his or her body is erotic. That view would be inconsistent with the fundamental role of sexual attraction in our most revered social institution\u2014marriage; to believe that a spouse is sexually attractive is not to demean the spouse. I do not think the Supreme Court has embraced the view that it is. In this light, it is apparent that the rationales supporting heightened scrutiny of gender discrimination have no purchase in the context of indecency laws based on inherent biological, morphological differences between the sexes.\n\nI\u2019m torn between libertarianism, subsidiarity, and conservatism on this point but end up agreeing with Hartz. It might well be that Fort Collins\u2019 ideas on public indecency are outmoded and that their concerns are overblown, but that\u2019s an issue for Fort Collins voters, not the federal courts. There are natural and significant differences between men and women that require specific attention in public indecency laws, which means there is a rational and essentially non-discriminatory reason for drawing those distinctions. Federal courts should have stopped when the obvious rational basis for this was made clear. (And to be honest, I\u2019d prefer that men cover up rather than free their nipples in public, too, but I don\u2019t live in Fort Collins.) The role of the federal judiciary is to judge cases in light of the Constitution and federal law, not to strike down laws they think are foolish. That\u2019s the job of legislatures and voters.\n\nBack in February, it looked likely that Fort Collins would appeal this to the Supreme Court. Now that they\u2019re out of the action, will one of the states impacted by their forfeit take up the challenge instead? As NBC News notes, it\u2019s ripe for cert, and thanks to another similar case, the court might end up taking both at the same time regardless:\n\nMost other courts have rejected equal-protection challenges to bans on female toplessness, as the Tenth Circuit acknowledged in its February ruling, saying \u201cours is the minority viewpoint.\u201d But the ruling said the trend has been toward \u201crequiring more\u2060\u2014 not less\u2014 judicial scrutiny when asserted physical differences are raised to justify gender-based discrimination.\u201d A challenge to a local topless ban in New Hampshire is now pending before the US Supreme Court, brought by three women who appeared topless at a lakeside beach. The state supreme court acknowledged that the law treats men and women differently. But it said public exposure of the female breast \u201calmost invariably conveys sexual overtones.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court will announce later this year whether it will hear the case.\n\nWe now have the kind of split that usually merits a grant of cert by the Supreme Court. If they do take this up, it will almost certainly be one of the most-watched cases on the docket this year.
