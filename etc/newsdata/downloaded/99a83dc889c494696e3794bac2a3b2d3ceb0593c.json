In Ducks, Newburyport, her 1,034-page novel, Ellmann\u2019s narrator, an Ohio housewife, lets loose an encyclopedic monologue that encompasses modern motherhood; the American health care system; Trump; the tainted water in Flint, Michigan; \u201cthe fact that the average teen checks their phone two thousand times a day\u201d; Marie Kondo; the plot of Little House on the Prairie; and other subjects.\n\nThe book consists mostly of a single, breathless \u2013 and utterly compelling \u2013 sentence.\n\nDucks, Newburyport has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize; other finalists include Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie. Ellmann, whose previous (much shorter) books include the novels Sweet Desserts and Mimi, prefers not to think of the prize in competitive terms.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nFrom her home in Scotland, the 62-year-old novelist offers some insights on her book \u2013 and how to read it.\n\nYour narrator is a mother of four who runs a baking business out of her home in Ohio and sometimes breaks into song but rarely stops to catch her breath. What is she trying to tell us?\n\nShe\u2019s not trying to tell you anything; she\u2019s just going about her business. Ducks, Newburyport doesn\u2019t yank at a reader\u2019s coat tails like The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (a book I love). Its approach is oblique, and it\u2019s up to the reader to make head or tail of it.\n\nIt\u2019s an approximation of consciousness, two consciousnesses actually \u2013 those of an American woman and a mountain lion. It follows the woman\u2019s turns of thought, her associations, dreams, regrets. It seems to me the most interesting thing in the world, to find out what someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 is really thinking.\n\nSometimes the narrator tries to steer her thoughts in directions she prefers, or recoils from certain darker avenues of thought, but she can\u2019t keep it up for long. The bad thoughts will creep in, the mean thoughts, sad thoughts, crazy thoughts. We are all helpless amid this constant onslaught of the mind. Even when we\u2019re asleep, we\u2019re still thinking. Sounds, flashbacks, snatches of song, sights, smells and other sensations (cold, hunger, itches) all come into it. I wish novels had Smell-O-Vision, or even better, John Waters\u2019 \u201cOdorama\u201d, which included a lot of useful unromantic smells.\n\nSome may think writing a one-sentence, thousand-plus-page book is gimmicky. What\u2019s your response?\n\nI would die before I used a gimmick. The thing in art is to find the correct form. The word \u201cgimmick\u201d belittles that effort, it belittles art.\n\nIf you could have written a second sentence, what would it have been?\n\nHa. Great question. The second sentence can perhaps be written after Bernie Sanders becomes president. It would go something like this: \u201cLet\u2019s all get together and fix this mess.\u201d\n\nYou have lived outside the US since you were a teen. And yet you chose to write in the voice of an American housewife and entrepreneur. Why \u2013 and how \u2013 did you summon that voice?\n\nShe\u2019s not an \u201centrepreneur\u201d, more like a beggar who\u2019s just trying to make ends meet (the family has been crippled by health-care costs). I know something about the freelance life myself. Not baking, but writing. It\u2019s unreliable, and isolating. (But often quite satisfying.)\n\nThe narrator is in some ways the person I might have been, had I never moved to Europe. But anyway, I never really left the US in my head. Marrying an American reinforced my American affiliations, even my accent. My husband and I had both lived in Britain for years, but pairing up seemed to consolidate our Americanness. Brits born after we ourselves arrived in Britain now rush to explain the UK to us.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Booker Prize guide 2019 1/6 Margaret Atwood \u2013 The Testaments (Vintage, Chatto & Windus) Most people can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Margaret Atwood\u2019s long-awaited follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which is not published until 10 September. One of the biggest books of the year, it comes 33 years after the original book was Booker Prize shortlisted. The Canadian author also won the Booker Prize for The Blind Assassin in 2000 and was shortlisted for Cat\u2019s Eye in 1989, Alias Grace in 1996 and Oryx and Crake in 2003. The Testaments is set 15 years after the end of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale and follows three women\u2019s lives in Gilead. It is coming at a particularly poignant time, as its dystopian future is looking more and more possible and season three of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale comes to an end on Channel 4 \u2013 leaving a gaping hole in the lives of fans of Atwood\u2019s gripping story. Liam Sharp 2/6 Salman Rushdie \u2013 Quichotte (Vintage, Jonathan Cape) Also on this year's shortlist is Salman Rushdie, whose book Midnight\u2019s Children won the Booker Prize in 1981. In 1993, it won the Booker of Bookers, to mark the 25th anniversary of the prize, and in 2008 the Best of the Booker to mark the 40th anniversary. Quichotte, a modern day retelling of Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote, which follows a travelling pharmaceutical salesman across America, came out last week to mixed reviews. The Independent gave it three stars, saying it is \u201cbogged down by fatiguing accumulations of examples and explanations\u201d. Rushdie was also shortlisted for Shame in 1983, The Satanic Verses in 1988, the novel which famously resulted in a fatw\u0101 calling for Rushdie's death, and The Moor\u2019s Last Sigh in 1995. He was longlisted for Shalimar the Clown in 2005 and The Enchantress of Florence in 2008. Beowulf and Sheehan 3/6 Lucy Ellmann - Ducks, Newbury Port (Galley Beggar Press) If Lucy Ellmann\u2019s novel wins the Booker Prize, it will be the longest page-turner in the history of the Prize, its 998 pages beating off The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton, which ran at 832 pages and won in 2013. Like Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s Fleabag, it is built around one woman\u2019s monologue, but not such a funny one. Told in only a handful of extremely long sentences with no paragraph breaks, an Ohio housewife frets about her past life \u2013 her love and losses, and the state of the nation, her dead parents and African elephants, among other things, in a stream-of-consciousness. Parts of the book are told from the perspective of a mountain lion \u2013 the link between the two narratives is never explained. This eighth book by the Anglo-US author might need a certain amount of commitment to get through, but it is well worth it in the end. 4/6 Chigozie Obioma \u2013 An Orchestra of Minorities (Hachette, Little Brown) Chigozie Obioma\u2019s debut, The Fisherman \u2013 a boyhood adventure in Nigeria in the Nineties \u2013 was shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker Prize and its timely stage adaptation, opens this week in the West End. The Nigerian author\u2019s second novel is a fast-moving romantic tragicomedy, which got rave reviews and is narrated by a guardian spirit in Igbo myth. It tells the heartbreaking story of a lovestruck Nigerian chicken farmer called Chinonso in present-day Nigeria, who sacrifices everything to win the heart of the woman he loves, but in his quest to impress her family with wealth and status, falls victim to an education scam in Cyprus. The book has been dubbed \u201ca contemporary twist on the Odyssey\u201d by the publisher; but with his bursts of violent anger, Chinoso has more in common with Othello than Odysseus. Jason Keith 5/6 Bernardine Evaristo - Girl, Woman, Other (Penguin General, Hamish Hamilton) This witty novel by the Anglo-Nigerian writer follows 12 interconnected characters \u2013 mostly black British women at different stages of womanhood. The publisher describes it as \u201ca vivid portrait of the state of post-Brexit Britain that looks back to the legacy of Britain\u2019s colonial history in Africa and the Caribbean\u201d. Its characters include a successful playwright, whose work explores her black lesbian identity, a nonbinary social media influencer, a 93-year-old woman living on a farm in Northern England, and a woman who retires to Barbados hiding a secret of sex and betrayal. The author says of her book: \u201cOne of my aims as a writer is to explore the hidden narratives of the African diaspora, to play with ideas, conjure up original and innovative fiction and forms, and to subvert expectations and assumptions.\u201d Born in London in 1959, she is a professor of creative writing at Brunel University London and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Jennie Scott 6/6 Elif Shafak -10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World (Penguin General, Viking) The British-Turkish novelist Elif Shafak, who is based in London, writes in Turkish and English, and is the most widely read female author in Turkey. The latest \u2013 her 11th novel \u2013 is a grim story about a sex worker called Tequila Leila who is murdered and left in a wheelie bin on the outskirts of Istanbul. In the final 10 minutes and 38 seconds of her life, as her consciousness leaves her body, memories from her life flood the page. The book is moving and sexually violent, but ultimately compassionate and life affirming. Shafak, who is also a serious activist, is under attack from the Turkish government for her writing, and has written many bestselling books including The Bastard of Istanbul, about modern day Turkey and Islam, which confront fundamentalism and misogyny in the Middle East. Oliver Hess 1/6 Margaret Atwood \u2013 The Testaments (Vintage, Chatto & Windus) Most people can\u2019t wait to get their hands on Margaret Atwood\u2019s long-awaited follow-up to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, which is not published until 10 September.

Oliver Hess\n\nI have family in America, and dear friends. The country\u2019s fate concerns me. It concerns the whole world! America\u2019s always in your face. We were in France when Obama was elected and people treated us to champagne. For breakfast! Everyone hoped it would mean an end to war. Huh, fat chance.\u200b\u200b\n\nIt matters to everybody what America does. And from the outside the horrors are blatant. It is an obtuse entity, endangering the whole world. Why the hell can\u2019t it learn to know itself?\n\nYour book offers a very complicated look at motherhood. At one point your narrator says, \u201cI\u2019m scared of all young women now, because when I look at them I see another potential mother-hater, the fact that I always wonder now how they treat their own mums.\u201d What are you trying to say about how society \u2013 and women in particular \u2013 view motherhood?\n\nI\u2019m not trying to say anything, I\u2019m saying it! I\u2019m kind of stunned by how harshly many daughters treat their mothers these days. This is gratingly anti-feminist, a self-perpetuating cycle of self-hatred, whereby these girls in turn will be scorned by their daughters. It is a sign of disunity, just when we need unity.\n\nThe devaluing of motherhood, though, is essential to patriarchy. Our society neglects mothers (practically and emotionally) and even the notion of motherhood. Freud has been exploited as another excuse to distrust mothers. This all serves misogyny extremely well.\n\nNot all women are mothers, luckily \u2013 what is the point of bearing children, after all, in such a world? What is the point of adding to consumption when what we need to do is pull back? But contempt for motherhood surges up from a well of disparagement of women in general, and the whole history of womanhood, a disparagement of life itself.\n\nI don\u2019t like overpopulation, but I have infinite respect for motherhood as a fact, an astounding fact throughout human history and the natural world. It\u2019s hard not to believe that the perspective of mothers is more rational and more considerate than many other perspectives. I agree with Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who said only nursing mothers should have control over nuclear bombs.\n\nIf it had been up to mothers, though, bombs would never have been created.\n\nHow do you feel being compared to Virginia Woolf?\n\nHonoured, if undeserving. I haven\u2019t read enough of Woolf\u2019s fiction yet. I\u2019ve concentrated more on her essays. I\u2019m particularly keen on Three Guineas. People have mentioned Mrs Dalloway a lot lately in connection with my novel, but it was not a conscious influence, as I haven\u2019t read it yet. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace?\n\nNever read him, so I can\u2019t tell what that means.\n\nJames Joyce?\n\nThrilled. But again, to me the connection seems remote. Many reviews have mentioned that my father was a Joyce scholar. Actually, my sister\u2019s one too. But I\u2019m not! My father did talk a lot about Joyce when I was growing up, when my mother didn\u2019t put her foot down. But mostly, I tuned it out. I regret that now \u2013 especially when people come to me with their Joyce questions!\n\nStill, I think it\u2019s weird for reviewers to bring up what my father did for a living. How often is the parentage of male novelists in their 60s mentioned?\n\nYour book repeats the phrasing \u201cthe fact that...\u201d as it spins out a litany of facts including \u201cthe fact that there\u2019s maybe too much emphasis on facts these days, or maybe there are just too many facts\u201d. Is this a critique of the Web? Or a backhanded critique of Trump (who also appears in your book)?\n\nIn my book \u201cthe fact that\u201d is a plaintive refrain, and a technique meant to generate suspense. Ducks is not a conglomeration of facts \u2013 this \u201clitany\u201d is a way of diving beneath the dead zone of facts to a more personal realm.\n\nI\u2019ve read that you are \u201ccommitted to peacefully circumventing all governments in order to create a worldwide matriarchy in which women, art and animals will be honoured, instead of bombs, steak, cigars, man caves, computers, gangster movies and garter belts\u201d. Which thing will go first and how?\n\nWe can do this the easy way or the hard way. My plan is that men should admit culpability in ruining the world, and in reparation hand over all their money and property to women. Whatever women do with the money, it\u2019s got to be better than what men spent it on. Once all wealth is in female hands, women can start sorting out the criminal catastrophe men have perpetrated.\n\nAdvances in metallurgy sparked the demise of matriarchy in the first place, 5,000 years ago, leading to a growth of weaponry and war. You can still see the link between weapons and misogyny today, in the number of American women shot by gun-toting men. So maybe we\u2019ll start by banning metal. Also porn. But men can still have beer.\n\nSince we are having this conversation in writing, I don\u2019t know if you are loquacious or succinct. Do you talk as much as your narrator thinks?\n\nNo.\n\nDid your book editor try to shorten the book?\n\nFar from it. Galley Beggar Press and Biblioasis were both wholly supportive of this book from the beginning. In the final stages, I worked most directly on it with my British publishers, Galley Beggar (who brought the book out first, a few months ahead of Biblioasis\u2019s edition for the US and Canada). During one revision I added 30,000 words. Not intentionally, it just happened! There wasn\u2019t a murmur from Sam Jordison and Elly Millar at Galley Beggar. Maybe they\u2019d fainted.\n\nAs of this writing, you have one comment on Amazon that says, \u201cHow the hell is one supposed to read this? My eyes would fall out of my head.\u201d What advice would you offer?\n\nDon\u2019t read it \u2013 that sounds pretty awkward. But what\u2019s the big deal, you know, if you\u2019re a real reader? How many books do people read in a year? Ducks is equivalent in length to four moderately sized novels. So it takes four weeks, not one. Many people have read it in a week, I hear. For me, it takes a month and a half \u2013 but I\u2019m a slow reader.\n\nHow many people do you expect will begin your book?\n\nAs many as want to.\n\nFinish it?\n\nAll of them. One English reviewer claimed only two percent of people (besides himself) would understand the book. My own estimation is that everyone can understand it, give or take a few babies.\n\nAre we dwelling too much on your book\u2019s length and heft?\n\nYes. The length is a necessary adjunct to what I wanted to get across, and the way I wanted to do that. Conventional narrative techniques and dutiful compression would not have suited this project. It had to be long. I\u2019d prefer to talk about content.\n\nCan I say that I also suspect it would not be such an issue if I were not female? Men can take liberties; a woman writing a long book is considered audacious, if not outrageous. Our novels, like us, are supposed to be petite. So many male reviewers have complained about this book\u2019s size that I fear male upper body strength may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. But come on, guys, it\u2019s just a novel, not 7,000 volumes of Wikipedia.\n\nNora Krug is an editor and writer at Book World\n\n\u00a9The Washington Post\n\n\u2018Ducks, Newburyport\u2019, published by Gallery Beggar Press, is out now", "description": "Lucy Ellmann has a lot to say.", "authors": ["Nora Krug"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/17/booker-prize-shortlist-lucy-ellmann-ducks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
