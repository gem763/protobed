And for Brunson, who spent his youth playing \u201cMike Tyson\u2019s Punch-Out\u201d before going on to score real-world knockouts inside the octagon, it was a special moment.\n\n\u201cIt was good,\u201d he told MMA Junkie. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because everybody knows who Mike Tyson is \u2013 even the kids know who Mike Tyson is. You go on YouTube, search the Internet, and you can find out a lot about him. I remember watching him all throughout my childhood, so it\u2019s good to finally meet him.\u201d\n\nBrunson is looking to reposition himself as a top middleweight contender and says his knockout power remains as dangerous as ever. And, with his tongue firmly in his cheek, he even suggested his power was more dangerous than being caught in a natural disaster.\n\n\u201cYou might survive a hurricane, but I don\u2019t know if you can survive one of my onslaughts, man,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially if there\u2019s no ref involved, man. You might be in trouble.\u201d\n\nBrunson has been relaxing between training sessions by catching up on NFL games while following the fortunes of the team he grew up with. But he admitted he had a soft spot for a certain gunslinging AFC team, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from (North) Carolina, so the Panthers are my team,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I like to watch the (Kansas City) Chiefs play. They\u2019re not my team \u2013 I can\u2019t jump on the bandwagon \u2013 but I love watching them play. (Patrick) Mahomes, he\u2019s a beast.\u201d\n\nAnd as for his video game prowess, Brunson said he was every bit as lethal on the buttons playing \u201cPunch-Out\u201d as a youngster as he is inside the cage today.\n\n\u201cI won the game, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could spam the buttons on Nintendo, so I finished the game.\u201d", "description": "MMA Junkie Radio's George Garcia grabs Derek Brunson for a quick chat backstage at the Dominance MMA media day at Tyson Ranch.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "George Garcia", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/off-guard-derek-brunson.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
