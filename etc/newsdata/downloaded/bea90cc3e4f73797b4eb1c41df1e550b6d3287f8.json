Fifteen points behind league leaders Liverpool already, as big as 4/1 with some bookmakers to win at Old Trafford and key players David De Gea and Paul Pogba injury doubts. There is a gulf in class between both teams, on the pitch as well as in the dugout.\n\nHowever, Liverpool have a psychological barrier to clear having lost 13 of their last 18 fixtures in all competitions at Old Trafford. Jurgen Klopp is yet to taste a league win there and Mohamed Salah has not scored against United in his Liverpool career.\n\nUnited held them to a goalless draw while severely under strength in this game last season, two dropped points that proved costly in May when Liverpool missed out on a first league title since 1990 by a point.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer's team is short of creativity and goals, but their primary objective today will be stopping Liverpool. United need this game to become a scrappy, low-quality fight - if it turns into a basketball match there is only one winner.\n\nUnited do have a reasonable defensive record and Liverpool have won just one of their last 10 away league games against members of the so-called 'Big Six'. So there is a ray of hope.\n\nSolskjaer was perhaps guilty of unnecessary provocation when describing Liverpool as United's 'perfect' opponents and claiming that it would not take 30 years for United to win their next title.\n\nThe United manager also added: \"We do have a plan and we know that we've made some decisions that maybe in the short-term would harm us, but we know in the long-term will benefit us.\n\n\"But results are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances.\"\n\nTeam news shortly.", "description": "Liverpool have been so stiff and lacking invention in this game.", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213611244-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOj5_Rmr3MNcQcsRkzAbTbVtAh_W-0ClgrZIOsseGpCI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
