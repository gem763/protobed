The company has closed about 2,300 phone booths over formaldehyde issues\n\nAn additional 700 booths are closed while more testing is conducted, it said. All the phone booths closed were installed over the past several months, WeWork said.\n\n'The safety and well-being of our members is our top priority and we are working to remedy this situation as quickly as possible,' WeWork said in a statement.\n\nMore costs are the last thing needed at the company, which some analysts say is fast running out of cash. WeWork declined to comment on the cost of testing and replacing the booths.\n\nIt is currently in talks for a multi-billion dollar rescue deal that could lead to its largest shareholder, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, taking control, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\nWeWork is also talking to JPMorgan Chase over a possible debt package, they said.\n\nWeWork declined to identify the manufacturer of the phone booths.\n\nWeWork has been struggling to regain its financial footing following the ouster of founding CEO Adam Neumann (above) last month and the withdrawal of its IPO plans\n\n'Long-term exposure to formaldehyde, such as that experienced by workers in jobs who experience high concentrations over many years, has been associated with certain types of cancers,' WeWork told tenants in the email.\n\nIn 1987, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen under conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure.\n\nSome studies since then suggested that formaldehyde exposure is associated with certain types of cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute.\n\nA tenant, who did not wish to be identified, said she was worried about the risk of cancer as she had spent hundreds of hours inside phone booths at a San Francisco WeWork that has the problem.\n\nPhone booths are popular in WeWork's open-plan offices as they provide privacy and noise reduction, the tenant said.", "description": "The New York-based company has closed about 2,300 phone booths at some of its 223 sites in the United States and Canada after it says it discovered elevated levels of formaldehyde.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/15/19745554-0-image-a-6_1571150557726.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
