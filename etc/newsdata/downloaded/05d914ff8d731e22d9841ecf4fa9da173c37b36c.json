Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ., and billionaire Tom Steyer all attended the forum inside the penitentiary. They, like their fellow 2020 contenders, have worked to make justice reform efforts a part of their platform, backing the end of cash bail, the private prison complex and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s event was the first of its kind, attended by those who have experienced the criminal justice system from the inside.\n\n\u201cWe have taken our national treasure and plowed it into the black hole of locking human beings up unjustly.\u201d Booker told the gathering.\n\nHarris spoke of the spirit of mercy.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to be a nation that is true to our stated values \u2026 values that include issues like the age-old concept of redemption,\u201d Harris said, \u201cthe incarceration system in America has not been humane and has not lived up to those values and must be reformed.\u201d\n\nThis comes on the heels of a criminal justice forum which Harris threatened to boycott, because President Trump was receiving an award; however she was the first to RSVP to Monday's Justice Votes town hall.\n\nSasha Pezenik-ABC News\n\nThose who have experienced the impact of incarceration first-hand opportunity to confront the candidates pitching themselves to win votes -- to an audience for whom voting itself remains an open question.\n\n\u201cI live and breath this, so being able to see what was a soundbite from some of these candidates versus actual action we can hold them accountable to... that\u2019s exciting and I think we need more opportunities like this,\u201d Brandon Holmes told ABC News. Many of his family members and friends - from his father, to his cousin - have been incarcerated and he\u2019s seen how it\u2019s torn at the family\u2019s fabric.\n\n\u201cWe always say those closest to the problem are closest to the solution, but we\u2019re often the furthest from power or resources to wield power or wield levers to create change in America.\u201d\n\nVoting rights for former inmates varies state by state. While some states restore voting rights to ex-offenders automatically after they finish their sentence, others bar voting through a former inmate's probation or parole. There are instances when the right to vote is lost indefinitely, often dependent on the jurisdiction or type of crime conviction, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nLast year Florida voters approved amendments to the state constitution to let people with felony convictions regain the right to vote, but it was quickly countered by legislators passing a series of sharp restrictions that would hamper ex-felons from reaching the polls.\n\nMoreover, the racial and economic disparity is vast: African Americans are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of whites, and serve longer sentences; impediments to re-enfranchisement like poll taxes hit low income offenders first.\n\nMark Makela/Getty Images\n\nMonday at the penitentiary, candidates came to address the breadth and depth of these issues, from sentencing reform for violent crime committers, to civil rights for those coming out of prison; they fielded tough questions about their own past as well.\n\nSteyer grew his fortune through his hedge fund Farallon Capital, where he made high-risk investments in distressed assets. In his portfolio, a large investment in the private prison complex - $34 million in 2005, in a for-profit prison firm called Corrections Corp. of America, which runs migrant detention centers on the U.S.-Mexico border, which have come under sharp criticism by Democratic presidential candidates this year.\n\nSteyer retired from the firm in 2012; he has said he \"deeply regret[s]\" his investment in CCA.\n\n\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI was wrong\u2026 and so, I corrected it on my own.\u201d\n\nMark Makela/Getty Images\n\nHarris faced a question form a moderator on whether she went too far in her policies as either prosecutor or as California's attorney general.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who have language now about it, but I would ask you to challenge them to tell---ask them what have they actually done to reform the criminal justice system? And then I will have more of a conversation with you about my record,\u201d she responded.\n\nSasha Pezenik-ABC News\n\nBooker on stage called out his fellow 2020 contenders who did not show up -- out of the wide and slowly winnowing Democratic field, three candidates spoke at the town hall Monday.\n\n\u201cWhere are you today?\u201d he asked of his primary rivals. \u201cWhere are you? Sincerely. This is a major national crisis\u2026 I am surprised and angry,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a chance to have a conversation with formerly incarcerated people, and we have three candidates showing up. That is unacceptable,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd it speaks to the Democratic Party\u2019s failures on criminal justice over the years. There should be more here... And again, cast -- continues to cast a shadow over our party\u2019s conviction and commitment on these issues.\u201d", "description": "2020 candidates Kamala Harris Tom Steyer and Cory Booker talk criminal justice reform with formerly incarcerated people at the historic Philadelphia penitentiary", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/kamala-town-hall-ap-jt191029_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
