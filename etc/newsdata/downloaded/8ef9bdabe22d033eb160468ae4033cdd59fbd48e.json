In 2005, there were only 1,700 of them in Madrid.\n\nAlthough the birds are native to Argentina, many were imported as pets before ownership was outlawed eight years ago.\n\nThe city council says the swelling population needs to be brought down as the parakeets are competing with other species for food and damaging the environment by stripping vegetation to build their huge stick nests.\n\nIt also says they pose a public health risk as they can pass illnesses such as psittacosis (parrot fever), avian flu and salmonella on to humans.\n\nAnd then there is the size of their nests.\n\n\u201cAs time goes on and they get bigger, these nests can become dangerous and weigh up to 200kg,\u201d the council said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThat represents a threat to the branches that support them and also to the people on whom they could fall.\u201d\n\nThe city authorities are working with the Spanish Ornithological Society, SEO Birdlife, and will begin \u201chumane slaughter\u201d and egg sterilisation over the coming months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to put into effect a plan to control and reduce the number of monk parakeets in the city of Madrid as they have become a worry for people and we\u2019ve had a lot of complaints,\u201d said Borja Carabante, the council\u2019s environmental representative.\n\nThe council said it had received 197 complaints about the birds between January and the end of August this year \u2013 almost as many as the 218 registered for the whole of last year.\n\nCarabante did not reveal how many parakeets would be targeted, but Santiago Soria, the council\u2019s head of biodiversity, said it would not eradicate the entire population. Without action, he added, the numbers would only continue to grow.\n\nThe cull, however, is not the city council\u2019s most controversial environmental initiative. The council \u2013 a coalition between the rightwing People\u2019s party and the centre-right Citizens party, backed by the far-right Vox party \u2013 has also sought to scrap the popular low-emissions zone introduced by the previous mayor, the leftwing former judge Manuela Carmena.\n\nAt the end of September, it announced plans to allow cars banned from the city centre back into the low-emissions zone and to reduce parking charges.\n\nAccording to the environmental group Ecologists in Action, Camena\u2019s Madrid Central scheme brought about record reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels in the city centre, with pollution from the gas 48% lower in April 2019 than during the same month last year. Nitrogen dioxide levels across the city were down by 16%.", "description": "Spanish capital to reduce number of brightly coloured birds over public health risk fears", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/150e926a800039a4490678e4637c2e09e0a05e08/0_89_2403_1442/master/2403.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e5a178ff2f315b844d52af3f7188839", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
