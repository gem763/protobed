We can avert a more severe slowdown, but I think the jury is out right now.\u201d\n\nU.S. growth slowed to an annualized 2% pace in the second quarter from 3.1% in the prior three months and is forecast to further moderate in the third quarter. Uncertainty stemming from trade disputes has slowed business investment, something Kaplan said he is watching carefully to see if it seeps into parts of the economy that have so far withstood the slowdown, such as the consumer.\n\nSpeaking later Thursday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, one of the U.S. central bank\u2019s most ardent doves, echoed concerns about downside risks. Both he and Kaplan will next vote on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2020.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed to cut rates by a quarter percentage point again at its Oct. 29-30 meeting in Washington following reductions in July and September. Kaplan said he will wait until right before the meeting to decide if he supports further policy easing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be wise for us not to over-telegraph where we are in the cycle,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cThis cutting we\u2019re doing should be limited, restrained and modest and not the start of a full-fledged cutting cycle.\u201d\n\nMinutes of September\u2019s FOMC meeting released Wednesday showed a debate emerging about how far their current interest-rate cutting campaign should extend, with several policy makers arguing the Fed should clarify when policy re-calibration due to trade policy uncertainty would end.\n\nKaplan also said he\u2019d rather use the central bank\u2019s policy ammunition \u201cwhen it matters most\u201d rather than waiting for evidence that the slowdown has spread to U.S. households.\n\n\u201cI think moving now gives us the best chance to avoid a more severe slowing and that\u2019s why I want to use the ammunition now even though, yes, it means we\u2019ll have a little less ammunition for later,\u201d he said.\n\nKashkari, speaking at a Yahoo (NASDAQ: ) Finance event in New York, said the central bank may need to cut again.\n\n\u201cI think likely,\u201d Kashkari said, responding to a question about whether more accommodation would be needed. \u201cMy best estimate right now is that interest rates are roughly around neutral, maybe slightly contractionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the downside risks have increased, then I think we should be taking measures to try to provide some support to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad that we\u2019re easing. I\u2019m not sure how much further we have to go, but I want to watch the data.\u201d\n\nThe record of the September meeting, which took place after the Fed was forced to intervene to calm a cash crunch in money markets for the first time in a decade, also showed a debate about boosting bank reserves via securities purchases to ease future strains.\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nKaplan said the Fed would soon make an announcement about expanding the balance sheet, echoing a statement by Jerome Powell on Tuesday, and agreed with the Fed chairman\u2019s comment that such a move should not be viewed as a resumption of quantitative easing.\n\nKaplan said the Fed would only be buying Treasury bills if it decided to proceed -- which have maturities of up to 52 weeks -- if it decided to proceed, rather than securities out along the yield curve as it did during the financial crisis. That action was designed to stimulate the economy by lowering longer-term borrowing costs, whereas this step would be aimed at ensuring the Fed is able to keep the policy rate within the target range, Kaplan said.\n\n(Updates with Neel Kashkari comments beginning in fourth paragraph.)", "description": "Fed\u2019s Kaplan Says Not Sure Economy Can Avert Severe Slowdown", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic2b52a1669887e17bfd40409197c18c6a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
