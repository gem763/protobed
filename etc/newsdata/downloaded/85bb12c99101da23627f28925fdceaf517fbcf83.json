The limited corporate history was also a concern. The CEO was parachuted in less than 18 months ago and apart from the CFO, every member of Latitude\u2019s nine-person senior executive team had been in their roles for one year or less.\n\nThat said, if it was priced 30 per cent lower we probably would have reconsidered.\n\nHow do you expect Ross McEwan to refine the strategy at NAB?\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of similarities between NAB and RBS. Both face/faced a loss in customer trust and an industry facing tighter margins given interest rates approaching zero. Although the issues around customer trust are not as severe at NAB and it is far better capitalised than RBS was in 2013.\n\nI think he will tackle these issues as he did at RBS. This may mean removing more non-interest customer costs and offering better mortgage rates to existing customers, so they don\u2019t have to refinance every couple of years to stay on the best rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition, NAB has more work to go on technology improvement. This is already underway, but I expect him to push it further.\n\nCan CSL reach $300?\n\nYes, it\u2019s a great business in a structural growth industry. With 10 per cent earnings growth expected over the next year it needs to expand its multiple by another 10 per cent to hit $300 in 12 months\u2019 time. As mentioned earlier, markets are very momentum driven so despite the fact we think CSL is trading at a full multiple here, a further 10 per cent multiple expansion is possible with expectations of earnings beats.\n\nThe key risk we are watching is competition for its plasma products. It is likely that competing products emerge over the next three to five years. If CSL hasn\u2019t hit $300 by then, we may have to wait a lot longer for it to have another crack.\n\nWhich company in your portfolio do you feel is most undervalued by the market?\n\nPraemium. This business has recently completely overhauled the functionality and usability of its key Australian software. We expect to see core inflows continue to improve as a result which will see a step change in its growth profile.\n\nAfter its recent rally it is trading at half to a third of the enterprise value to sales multiple of peers Hub24 and Netwealth. This valuation gap should close as Praemium\u2019s flows improve.\n\nAdditionally, Praemium makes very little margin on cash which is currently a key market concern for Hub24 and Netwealth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe're always looking for new TV to stream. Anything new or old caught your eye?\n\nI have been watching and listening to a lot of content on Real Vision. It\u2019s an app where investors share content on what is happening in today\u2019s markets. I\u2019ve found myself listening to this more than podcasts on the way to work. Unfortunately, you have to subscribe for $279.99 a year so it won\u2019t be for everyone.\n\nFinally, a recommendation for a good value quick bite in Sydney?\n\nThe Cook & Baker on Oxford St in Bondi Junction. A great Kiwi bakery that\u2019s producing all the favourites better than I remember them as a kid. The custard donuts are amazing and hit the shelves at 9am.", "description": "AFR Markets Live catches up with Milford's William Curtayne about why he sold Wisetech and the case for CSL at $300.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1445%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2118%2C$y_514/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/33cdfc3ef9876cf872198175e78bc0199a5c5b68", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
