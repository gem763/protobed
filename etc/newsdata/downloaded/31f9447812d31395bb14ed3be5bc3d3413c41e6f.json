They are all middle-to-low-income.\n\nThe WHO recommends countries have at least 10 donations per 1,000 people. But in Africa, 38 countries collect fewer than that target, researchers estimate.\n\nSouth Sudan was found to have the lowest supply of blood at just 46 units per 100,000 people.\n\nThe world is in the midst of a critical shortage of blood essential for life-saving transfusions. Researchers estimate 119 countries do not have enough supply to meet hospital demands. They include nations in Africa, Oceania and south Asia (shown in red, yellow and orange)\n\nResearchers said the African nation's need for blood was 75 times greater than its supply.\n\nThe scientists found India had the largest absolute shortage, with the country experiencing a shortfall of nearly 41million units.\n\nThey say more investment needs to be made in low and middle-income countries to expand national transfusion services.\n\nTransfusions save millions of lives each year and replace blood that is lost through surgery or injury or provide it if your body is not making blood properly.\n\nPatients may need a blood transfusion if they have anaemia, sickle cell disease, a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia, or cancer.\n\nDeveloping countries rely on these transfusions due to a higher prevalence of blood-borne diseases and complications during pregnancy.\n\nWHO CAN GIVE BLOOD IN THE UK? Most people can give blood. Donors have to be: Fit and healthy\n\nWeigh between 50kg (7st 12lbs) and 160kg (25st)\n\nAged 17-to-66 Donors can be 70 if they have given blood before, or older if they have donated in the past two years. Men can donate every 12 weeks and women every 16 weeks. Males can give more frequently due to them generally weighing more, which correlates to them having more iron. Giving blood removes iron from the body. This is an essential mineral that helps to give a person strength and energy. A person may be unable to give blood if they: Are undergoing medical or hospital treatment\n\nTake certain medication\n\nHave traveled to 'restricted areas' recently\n\nHave a tattoo or piercing\n\nAre pregnant or recently gave birth\n\nFeel ill\n\nHave cancer\n\nAre receiving blood or an organ transplant Source: NHS Blood and Transplant\n\nMore than 100million units of blood are donated each year to these nations, which make up 80 per cent of the entire world's population.\n\nHigh-income countries, home to just 16 per cent of the global population, bear the burden of this, providing 42 per cent of the blood in developing nation's banks.\n\nFor their study, researchers from the University of Washington looked at the WHO Global Status Report on Blood Safety and Availability for every country in the world.\n\nTo estimate the total blood needs of any one country, the researchers calculated how many units of blood would be needed for 20 different medical conditions.\n\nTaking into account their prevalence by region, the team then estimated the gap between supply and demand in each one of these nations.\n\nThey then cross referenced this with data from the WHO Global Status Report on Blood Safety and a 2017 Global Burden of Disease study.\n\nThe team based blood usage rates using US inpatient practices.\n\nThey note this may underestimate the true blood needs in developing countries where tropical diseases, STIs and malaria are far more common than they are in America.\n\nBut they say these initial findings give health bosses a rough estimate which can help them prepare for the future.\n\nTheir findings, published in the journal The Lancet, revealed every single country needed more blood than the WHO goal.\n\n\n\nThe team of academics calculated total blood supply around the world was around 272million units.\n\nBut with demand being 303m units, the world was 30m units of blood short. In the 119 countries with insufficient supply, that shortfall reached 100million units.\n\nAnd, with exponentially increasing populations and greater access to hospital care, demand is only going to increase, the researchers say.\n\nLead author Meghan Delaney, from the Children's National Hospital in Washington, said: 'As more people are able to access care in low and middle income countries, the demand for blood transfusions will increase further.\n\n'And - without financial, structural and regulatory support - will widen the gap we've uncovered between global supply and demand of blood.'\n\nCo-author Christina Fitzmaurice, a professor in haematology at the University of Washington, added: 'Other studies have focused on blood safety, such as the risk of transmitting infections such as HIV.\n\n'But ours is the first to identify where the most critical shortages lie, and therefore where the most work needs to be done by governments to increase donation, scale-up transfusion services, and develop alternatives.'\n\nWriting in the study, the authors conclude: 'Strategic investments are needed in many low-income and middle-income countries to expand national transfusion services, blood management systems, and alternatives to blood transfusions.\n\n'There is a large unmet need for more government support, financially, structurally, and through establishment of a regulatory oversight to ensure supply, quality, and safety.'", "description": "A global report showed 119 out of 196 countries in Africa, Oceania and south Asia do not have enough supply to meet hospital demands.
