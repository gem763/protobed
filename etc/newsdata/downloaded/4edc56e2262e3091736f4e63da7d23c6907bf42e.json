Instead of being allowed to return to Canada or the U.K., Eileen Connors alleges that her entire family, including her 3-month-old son, ended up detained at the Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa., where they have spent more than a week living in \u201cfrigid\u201d and \u201cfilthy\u201d conditions. As of late Monday, Bridget Cambria, the Connors\u2019s lawyer, told The Washington Post that the British family was still at the center waiting to be deported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe will never forget, we will be traumatized for the rest of our lives by what the United States government has done to us,\u201d Connors wrote in a sworn statement, later adding, \u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to. \u2026 It is undoubtedly the worst experience we have ever lived through.\u201d\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection could not be reached for comment late Monday. Officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed in a statement to the BBC that the family is being held at the Leesport facility, but disputed their claims of mistreatment. The center, the statement said, \u201cprovides a safe and humane environment for families as they go through the immigration process.\u201d\n\n\u201cReports of abuse or inhumane conditions at BFRC are unequivocally false,\u201d officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConnors, however, alleges that the mistreatment began shortly after her family was stopped by the American officer.\n\nEven before the tourists could explain why they were on the road, Connors, 24, wrote that her 30-year-old husband David and his cousin, who was driving at the time, were arrested.\n\n\u201cYou crossed an international border,\u201d said the officer, who allegedly did not read the men their rights and ignored the family\u2019s pleas that they had unknowingly crossed into the U.S. and never intended to enter the country during their trip, despite having the proper visas. The complaint did not specify exactly where the incident took place.\n\nThe family asked if they could \u201csimply turn around\u201d and were denied, Connors wrote.\n\nAD\n\nConnors and her baby were separated from her husband and placed in \u201ca very cold cell\u201d at an undisclosed Border Patrol station in Washington state, the statement said. Cambria, a lawyer with Aldea - The People\u2019s Justice Center in Pennsylvania, told The Post that the frigid detention cells have a nickname: \u201cHieleras,\u201d or \u201ciceboxes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Connors were issued \u201cmetal-like, thin emergency blankets\u201d to keep warm, according to the complaint. David Connors was also given a foam cup with noodle soup to eat, but he described the meager meal as \u201cnot even apt for animals,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThen, all they could do was wait, Eileen Connors wrote.\n\n\u201cThe officers left us in the cell the entire day, with no information, no call to our family back home, no idea when we would be free to leave,\u201d Connors wrote.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it came time to sleep, Connors said she refused to allow her son to \u201clie on the disgusting floor\u201d next to her, at one point even trying to balance the infant on top of her body.\n\n\u201cWe are so sickened by all of this,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe idea and memory of our little baby having to sleep on a dirty floor of a cell will haunt us forever.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn the morning, immigration officers told the Connors that they could be released if they provided contact information for any family member living in the U.S. who could sponsor them, the statement said. Luckily, a relative with U.S. citizenship agreed to help.\n\n\u201cWe were ready for all of this to end,\u201d Connors wrote.\n\nAD\n\nBut hours later, the Connors were informed that they wouldn\u2019t be leaving. There was \u201ca change in plans,\u201d and soon after, they were loaded into a van in what \u201cfelt like an abduction or kidnapping,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nDavid Connors was dropped off at the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, while Eileen Connors and her baby were taken to a Red Roof Inn in Seattle to spend the night.\n\nThey were reunited the next morning at a promising location: the Seattle airport.\n\n\u201cI thought, finally we\u2019re going home and felt relieved, even though the officers would not tell me where we were going or why,\u201d Eileen Connors wrote.\n\nAD\n\nBut, her relief was short-lived.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the Connors got off their flight, they were in Pennsylvania. Their final destination was the Berks Family Residential Center, a facility advocates have decried as \u201cbaby jail,\u201d according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nThe arrival of the Connors and their infant son on Oct. 5 marked \u201cthe first time in a long time that we\u2019ve had a child under the age of 1 in this facility,\u201d Cambria told The Post. The other couple, who had been traveling with the Connors, and their 2-year-old twins were also transported to Berks, Cambria said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s suitable for children that young because newborns probably shouldn\u2019t be around a hundred other kids all of whom are coming from different parts of the world,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cThere were a lot silly decisions made along the way. In this instance, when you\u2019re talking about a 3-month-old, those silly decisions can be really dangerous.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrom the moment she and her family were placed in the \u201ciceboxes\u201d in Washington state, Connors wrote that she worried about her son, who has not yet completed his immunizations, falling ill. Those concerns were only heightened once they were at the Berks center.\n\nConnors alleged that she had to bathe her son on a couch inside an office using a washcloth and soap because he was too small for the showers. The baby bathtub she had been provided was \u201cfilthy dirty and had broken bits,\u201d she wrote. Her son was also left without clothing, blankets or bibs for several hours because the center\u2019s staff took the items to be washed, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe blankets and sheets in our room have a disgusting smell, like a dead dog,\u201d Connors wrote. \u201cI cannot use them to wrap up my baby for fear they haven\u2019t been washed properly and my baby will become sick.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, Connors wrote that her baby \u201cwoke up with his left eye swollen and teary\u201d and his skin was \u201crough and blotchy.\u201d Officials told the Connors that their son was \u201ca bit young\u201d to be at the center, and if they wanted they could sign papers allowing him to be separated from them, the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe were shocked and disgusted at the thought of our baby being taken from us, and ever since I cannot sleep thinking that someone might come in and take him from me,\u201d Connors wrote.\n\nBeyond the alleged living conditions, the Connors also claim that they were not given an opportunity to call their embassy, instead relying on family members to reach out on their behalf. In the statement, Eileen Connors wrote that she only learned that the embassy had tried to contact her and her family while they were detained on Oct. 7, accusing the center\u2019s staff of not passing along the message until it was too late in the day to call back.\n\nAD\n\nAfter getting in touch with the embassy, Connors wrote that her family\u2019s situation started to improve. She observed staff members cleaning the facility and she was given a playpen and little tub for her son, according to the statement. ICE officials also suggested that the family would get to go home in the near future, but did not provide details, Connors wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Cambria told The Post that the Connors were \u201chopeful they\u2019re leaving as soon as\u201d Tuesday.\n\nWhile there have been other cases as recently as last year of people getting detained after accidentally crossing the U.S.-Canada border, Cambria said she was most bothered by \u201cthe extreme level of enforcement exhibited\u201d toward the vacationing family and their young children.", "description": "\u201cWe have been treated like criminals here, stripped of our rights, and lied to,\u201d Eileen Connors wrote in a sworn statement. \u201cIt is undoubtedly the worst experience we have ever lived through.\u201d", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ORiJcesFLwqS0QPdW_hCrLzJRig=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6G5AT2FLWYI6TFARUYEPTUGC2M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
