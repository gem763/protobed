Mark Zuckerberg admitted that encrypting messages impedes the investigation of crimes like child exploitation and terrorism, but said the company would use other methods to combat such crimes. (Reuters)\n\nTalking point: The open letter stands in stark contrast to another written by about 50 civil organizations\u2014including the Canadian Internet Registration Authority, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Digital Rights Watch\u2014which called on Facebook to \u201cstay strong\u201d on encryption. While the governments argued it reduces public safety, the civil rights groups said it is crucial for maintaining public safety and democratic values. One sticking point is the creation of \u201cbackdoors\u201d that would allow authorities to decrypt messages\u2014privacy advocates argue their creation defeats the purpose of encryption. Canada is notably not among the critical letter\u2019s signatories, with encryption proving a sticky subject for Ottawa. Earlier this year, the government joined a public Five Eyes statement warning that it increases the proliferation of online child exploitation, but has also told The Globe and Mail it is not seeking legislation that would weaken encryption.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
