Mr Thurlbourn has now appealed the decision to the Planning Inspectorate\n\n'The dome is also visible from public views along the road and is a prominent feature in the rear gardens.\n\n'This type of development, while only for personal use of the applicant, is not the type of structure you would normally expect to see in this residential location.\n\n'Given the scale, bulk and design of the observatory dome it is considered to be an incongruous form of development and un-neighbourly given its location and height in close proximity to neighbouring garden.'\n\nHe added that the shed element of the building was acceptable but stressed that the dome was not.\n\nConcluding the council's decision, Mr Collins said: 'Taking national and local planning policies into account, and having regard for all relevant material considerations, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.'\n\nMr Thurlbourn has now appealed the decision to the Planning Inspectorate.", "description": "Melvyn Thurlbourn built the 12ft high dome on top of his shed in St Ives,\u00a0Cambridgeshire.
