Schiff has said it was \"meant to be at least part in parody.\"\n\nA spokesman for Schiff's committee acknowledged last week that the whistleblower approached the panel for guidance before filing his complaint about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to pursue an investigation into the Bidens, but there is no evidence that Schiff or the panel helped draft the complaint.\n\nTrump referred to both Schiff's characterization of his call with Zelenskiy and the whistleblower's approach to the House Intelligence Committee in his email targeting Pelosi.\n\n\"This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n\"I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly 'Colluded' with them, must all be immediately Impeached!\"\n\n(Reporting by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Tom Hogue, Robert Birsel)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, under pressure as Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry against him, lashed out at the top Democrat in Congress on Sunday, saying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be guilty of treason.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
