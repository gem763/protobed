Kolodny recently testified as a star witness for Oklahoma in a recent opioid negligence lawsuit that ended in a $572m judgement against Johnson & Johnson.\n\nUnder the proposed settlement between Purdue and states attorney\u2019s general across the US, Purdue would have been put into a trust and profits from sales of drugs including Oxycontin would have gone to toward paying for costs incurred by states and municipalities in relation to the opioid epidemic.\n\n\u201cThat put states in a position of profiting from futures sales of opioids at a time when they should really be doing what they can to encourage more cautious prescribing,\u201d Kolodny said.\n\n\u201cIt would have been perverse incentive for the states,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, attorneys general involved in the talks said in a message to their counterparts across the country that settlement talks with Purdue were at an impasse after Purdue and its Sackler family owners rejected two offers and that the family declined to offer new terms.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the negotiations are at an impasse, and we expect Purdue to file for bankruptcy protection imminently,\u201d wrote Herbert Slatery and Josh Stein, attorneys general of Tennessee and North Carolina.\n\nBut in a statement to NPR on Sunday, the drug company suggested a deal might still be possible.\n\n\n\n\u201cPurdue Pharma believes a settlement that benefits the American public now is a far better path than years of wasteful litigation and appeals,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThose negotiations continue and we remain dedicated to a resolution that genuinely advances the public interest.\u201d\n\nAgainst a backdrop of protest against the Sacklers that has seen art and cultural institutions picketed over their acceptance of Sackler philanthropic donations, the wealthy billionaires have been attempting to avoid a trial that could have established Purdue\u2019s responsibility for the public health crisis.\n\nAs it now stands, states and around 2,000 local governments will head for bankruptcy court for the company\u2019s remaining assets.\n\nThat outcome, says Kolodny, is preferable because under the terms of the $12bn deal floated last week, records of Purdue\u2019s efforts to encourage the over-prescription of opioids would have been erased.\n\n\u201cTo see the litigation continue in some point in the future is better because it offers the public a better opportunity to find out about the wrongdoings that Purdue and the Sacklers were involved in and what really happened,\u201d said Kolodny.\n\nThe family, he said, had not acknowledged any wrongdoing \u2013 a continuation of a pattern established when Purdue settled an earlier opioid case in Oklahoma for $270m.\n\n\u201cThe Sacklers have not taken responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nOver the weekend, Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro, one of the four state attorneys general involved in negotiations, said he intends to sue the family.\n\n\u201cI think they are a group of sanctimonious billionaires who lied and cheated so they could make a handsome profit,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly believe that they have blood on their hands.\u201d\n\nThat chimes with Nan Goldin, the art photographer who has led a protest campaign to force art institutions to divest the Sackler donations and remove the family\u2019s name from their lists of donors.\n\nGoldin described the earlier, rejected $12bn settlement in which Purdue would have gone into bankruptcy as a \u201cblackmail.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is orchestrated by the Sacklers and very well done, but underneath it\u2019s highly questionable. We want them to be held personally accountable, and that\u2019s not going to be possible with this settlement,\u201d she said.\n\nThe family\u2019s efforts to clear it name continue.\n\nOn Monday, the New York Post reported that heiress Joss Sackler had offered recovering opioid addict Courtney Love more than $100,000 to attend her fashion week show.\n\nLove said she had rejected the offer. \u201cThe Sackler family has no shame \u2013 I won\u2019t sell out to them,\u201d she told the paper.\n\nThe Sacklers have previously rejected allegations that they bear some responsibility for the opioid crisis.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile plaintiffs\u2019 court filings have created an erroneous picture and resulted in unwarranted criticism, we remain committed to playing a substantive role in addressing this complex public health crisis. Our hearts go out to those affected by drug abuse or addiction,\u201d a family spokesman said earlier this year.", "description": "Purdue Pharma may be forced to file after talks broke down over settlement, allowing public to learn \u2018what really happened\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/657e2f631ae8cfee49ef3a7d91d474e3b6900a87/0_347_3875_2326/master/3875.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cb6934bd70fe17ee5cd857f52f6f1b7a", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
