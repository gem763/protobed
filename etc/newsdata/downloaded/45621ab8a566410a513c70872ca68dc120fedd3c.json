Roads, cars, homes, and an airport appear to be almost entirely underwater. \u201cThe runway is under about three feet of water,\u201d someone on the plane can be heard saying. \u201cThe fire station is gone.\u201d\n\nDorian made landfall on Great Abaco on Sunday as a Category 5 storm with wind speeds of 185 mph. Five people are confirmed dead, and thousands have lost their homes.\n\n\n\nKevin D. Harris, the director general of the Bahamas Information Center, told the New York Times that authorities were particularly concerned about the Abacos, since the islands are home to two shantytowns primarily populated by Haitian migrant workers.\n\nWe are already hearing from residents that whole towns have been wiped out and devastated,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThis is going to be a big search-and-rescue and rebuilding effort. I don\u2019t think we have seen anything as bad as this. This one is for the history books.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthorities received calls from more than 200 families trapped on rooftops or in attics, and one caller reported a five-month-old baby stranded on a roof.\n\nDorian also hit Grand Bahama, where it remained \u201cfirmly planted\u201d for nearly two days, according to the National Hurricane Center. Though the storm has since been downgraded to a Category 2, it moved through the island at just 1 mph.\n\n\u201cDowntown Grand Bahama is under three feet of water, including the ground floor of its hospital and the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.\n\nGrand Bahama and the Abaco islands have a combined population of about 70,000, according to the Associated Press. A Red Cross spokesperson told the AP that more than 13,000 homes \u2014 or 45% of all the homes on the islands \u2014 have been damaged or destroyed.\n\nCover: A volunteer looks for the owner of a dog he rescued from the rising waters of Hurricane Dorian, on a flooded road near the Causarina bridge in Freeport, Grand Bahama, Bahamas, Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2019. The storm\u2019s punishing winds and muddy brown floodwaters devastated thousands of homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics.
