Is there a job out there that gives you a six-figure income, high job satisfaction and has enough job openings to make it a real possibility? As unemployment hovers a 49-year low, it\u2019s a question worth asking.\n\nThere\u2019s probably never been a better time since the Great Recession to start looking. The U.S. economy is slowing down and added 130,000 new jobs in August, the government reported.\n\nIs there a job out there that gives you a six-figure income, high job satisfaction and has enough job openings to make it a real possibility?\n\nCompanies are always keen to use intel to improve efficiency and learn more about their customers and, so, data scientists are in high demand.\n\nThey\u2019re No. 1 on Glassdoor\u2019s \u201c50 Best Jobs in America\u201d for 2019 \u2014 for the fourth straight year. They boast a median base annual salary of $108,000, but Glassdoor also says there are signs their salary growth has been levelling off. They were followed by nursing managers at No. 2 ($83,000) and marketing managers at No. 3 ($82,000), occupational therapists at No. 4 ($74,000) and product managers at No. 5 ($115,000).\n\nThe \u201cGlassdoor Job Score\u201d is determined by weighing three factors equally: Earning potential (median annual base salary), overall job satisfaction rating and number of job openings. For a job title to be considered, it must receive at least 100 salary reports and at least 100 job satisfaction ratings shared by U.S.-based employees in one year. Results represent job titles that rate highly among all of those three categories. C-suite and intern level jobs were excluded from this report.\n\nRead MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist advice column on the etiquette and ethics of your financial affairs and, this week: \u2018 My children\u2019s stepmother won\u2019t return family heirlooms and gifts they gave their late father \u2014 how can we get them back?\u2019\n\nThere were other six-figure jobs among Glassdoor\u2019s top 20 list with a relatively high number of openings, job satisfaction and earning potential, including devops engineers at No. 6 ($106,000 a year) who work with developers and the IT staff to oversee code releases, data engineers at No. 8 ($100,000), software engineers at No. 10 ($104,000), physician assistant at No. 12 ($105,000), strategy manager at No. 16 ($140,000) and security engineers at No. 17 ($102,000).\n\nDon\u2019t miss: One reason wages aren\u2019t rising faster: The gutting of middle-manager positions\n\nBut data scientists have competition. A separate report by the U.S. News & World Report on the best jobs of the year lists software developers as No. 1. The position offers flexible hours and remote work opportunities, while investing in individuals\u2019 personal and professional development. Like data scientists, software developers have a median annual salary of over $100,000. They\u2019re employed in computer systems design, manufacturing and finance. Physician assistants were No. 2, followed by dentists at No. 3.\n\nThe \u2018Glassdoor Job Score\u2019 is determined by weighing three factors equally: Earning potential (median annual base salary), overall job satisfaction rating and number of job openings.\n\nData scientists and software developers use programming language such as Python, followed by R, SQL, Hadoop and the more well-known Java, according to careers site Glassdoor. A mid-level data scientist is likely to be proficient in Python, R and SQL, and make close to $130,000 a year. Google GOOG, -0.53%, Aetna US:AET, and Microsoft MSFT, -0.68% typically hire people for these roles.\n\nThe jobs environment is getting rosier, at least judging by the latest jobs figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% in August and remained near a 50-year low. What\u2019s more, more people entered the labor force in search of work, the government reported. The labor force participation rate was 63.2% in August, up slightly from 63% in July.\n\nThis story was updated on Sept. 6, 2019.", "description": "This analysis is based on median salary, overall job satisfaction and the number of job openings.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FU919_big_da_ZG_20170922160127.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-03"}
