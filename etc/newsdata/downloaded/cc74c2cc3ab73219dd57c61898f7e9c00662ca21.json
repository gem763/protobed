(AFP)\n\nApple has removed from its online store a smartphone app that allows Hong Kong activists to report police movements after an official Chinese newspaper accused the company of facilitating illegal behaviour.\n\nThe tech giant became the latest company to come under pressure to take Beijing\u2019s side against anti-government protesters when the Communist Party newspaper People\u2019s Daily said the HKmap.live app \u2018facilitates illegal behaviour\u2019.\n\nThe newspaper asked: \u2018Is Apple guiding Hong Kong thugs?\u2019\n\nThe Hong Kong demonstrations began over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include other grievances and demands for greater democracy. Apple said in a statement that HKmap.live was removed because it \u2018has been used to target and ambush police\u2019 and \u2018threaten public safety\u2019.\n\nIt said that violated local law and Apple guidelines.\n\nHKmap.live allows users to report police locations, use of tear gas and other details that are added to a regularly updated map.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother version is available for smartphones that use the Android operating system.\n\nThe Apple statement said: \u2018We have verified with the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau that the app has been used to target and ambush police, threaten public safety, and criminals have used it to victimise residents in areas where they know there is no law enforcement.\n\n\u2018This app violates our guidelines and local laws, and we have removed it from the App Store.\u2019\n\nA Twitter account linked to the app posted a statement denying it endangered police or Hong Kong residents.\n\nA protester wearing a Guy Fawkes mask uses her mobile phone as protesters supporting activist Edward Leung gather outside the High Court during an appeal hearing for his period of sentence, in Hong Kong, China (EPA)\n\nIt said the app collects information from its users and public sources and does not \u2018solicit, promote or encourage criminal activity\u2019.\n\nIn Hong Kong, users of HK Maps said the application helped them steer clear of police patrols whose riot control methods and policing during the crisis have been widely criticised as heavy-handed, undermining public support for what long was considered one of Asia\u2019s best police forces.\n\nOffice worker Acko Wong, 26, said he downloaded the app to help him avoid \u2018danger and traffic\u2019 during the many protests that have shaken the city.\n\nHe said the argument that the app could be used to ambush police and could point criminals to areas where police are not stationed \u2018does not make sense\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018How do you ambush a group of police with equipment and gear like helmets and shields?\u2019 he asked.\n\nApple phone user Canny Ng said Apple\u2019s decision was unacceptable and would make her think twice about buying more of the company\u2019s technology.\n\nAlthough she had not downloaded the app before it was removed, she has consulted the web-based version of HK Maps that is still live.\n\nWith a six-month-old baby boy at home, Ms Ng said she has not joined the protests. But the crisis has left her afraid of the police, making HK Maps \u2018quite useful\u2019, she said.\n\n\u2018I cannot accept what the police are doing right now,\u2019 she said.\n\nThat the app even exists \u2018means that most of the Hong Kong people, maybe they\u2019re really afraid of the police nowadays,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018Even myself, I just want to find a way that I won\u2019t see any police, especially when I\u2019m wearing black. You\u2019re worried that, oh, maybe they will check your ID.\u2019\n\nPeople attend a flash mob rally to show support for pro-democracy protesters in the Central district in Hong Kong on October 11 (AFP)\n\nActivists complain Beijing and Hong Kong leaders are eroding the autonomy and Western-style civil liberties promised to the former British colony when it returned to China in 1997.\n\nPeople\u2019s Daily warned Apple\u2019s reputation with Chinese consumers might suffer.\n\n\u2018Apple needs to think deeply,\u2019 the newspaper said.\n\nBrands targeted in the past by Beijing have been subjected to campaigns by the entirely state-controlled press to drive away consumers or to disruptive investigations by tax authorities and other regulators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChina has long been critical to Apple\u2019s business. The mainland is Apple\u2019s second-biggest market after the United States but chief executive Tim Cook said it will eventually become number one.\n\nApple, which has its headquarters in Cupertino, California, is also an important asset for China. Most of its iPhones and tablet computers are assembled in Chinese factories that employ hundreds of thousands of people.", "description": "They say the app violates guidelines", "authors": ["Metro Tech Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_85753372_1570800848.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
