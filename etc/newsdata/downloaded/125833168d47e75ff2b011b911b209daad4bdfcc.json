The U.S. and several allies have blamed the attack on Iran, which has denied involvement.\n\nA top Iranian official disputed the cyber operation was successful, and the Pentagon declined to comment, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cThey must have dreamt it,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Minister of Communications and Information Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi, the Fars news agency reported.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence or planning,\u201d Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith told Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. has been mostly mum with respect to the government\u2019s offensive operations in cyberspace. The Pentagon has recently cited a classified directive issued in 2018 by President Trump \u2014 the National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, or NSPM 13 \u2014 with allowing the U.S. military to take a more offensive stance in attacking targets abroad, however.\n\n\u201cBy defending forward, we are able to see and understand malicious cyber behavior, allowing us to publicly expose that activity and its culprits. It\u2019s also posturing us to take action against these threats, at their source, before they reach the homeland,\u201d Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper said last month about the memorandum.\n\nThe Washington Post previously reported that the Pentagon relied on NSPM 13 during the 2018 midterm elections to hinder the operations of the Internet Research Agency, a Russian \u201ctroll farm\u201d accused of interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential race in part by spreading propaganda on social media.\n\nMore recently, a bipartisan report released by the Senate Intelligence Committee this month stated that foreign adversaries including Iran, among others, have adopted the disinformation tactics deployed by Russia and are likely to use them against Americans during the 2020 election.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
