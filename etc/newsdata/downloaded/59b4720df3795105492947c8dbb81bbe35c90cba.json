A number of people (are) taking the law into their own hands,\" he said in Cape Town, ahead of a three-day meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) due to be attended by 15 African leaders.\n\n\"Taking action against people of other countries is not right,\" he said.\n\n\"South Africa is home for all. We are not the only country that has become home for people fleeing.\"\n\nFive people, most of them South Africans, have been killed and at least 289 have been arrested since the violence flared on Sunday.\n\nDozens of shops have been destroyed in Johannesburg and nearby Pretoria, the country's political capital.\n\nTrucks suspected of being driven by foreigners have also been torched in the southeastern province of KwaZulu-Natal\n\nSouth Africa is a major destination for economic migrants from neighbouring Lesotho, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. But others come from much farther away, including South Asia and Nigeria.\n\nThe influx has led to sporadic outbreaks of violence against foreign businesses, sparked by the perception that jobs are being taken away from South Africans\n\nIn 2008, xenophobic violence left 62 dead, while in 2015, seven people were killed in attacks in Johannesburg and Durban.\n\nBut the latest rash of attacks has sparked particular concern. It comes against a background of persistently grim news about the economy. Nearly one in three of South Africans are unemployed.\n\nIn Nigeria, police on Wednesday said security had been strengthened around South African businesses after apparent reprisal attacks in several cities against stores operated by the supermarket chain Shoprite, the telecoms giant MTN and other firms.\n\nNigeria on Tuesday summoned the South African ambassador for talks and said President Muhammadu Buhari was sending an envoy to convey his displeasure to Ramaphosa.\n\nSimilar messages of concern have been voiced by South Africa's neighbours.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, President Emmerson Mnangagwa said: \"We strongly condemn all forms of hate driven violence and applaud the South African authorities for the swift way they have responded.\"\n\nIn Botswana, the ministry of international affairs and cooperation urged all citizens living in or travelling to South Africa \"to exercise extreme caution... (and) avoid areas where unrests are currently occurring.\"", "description": "South Africa and Nigeria stepped security on Wednesday after deadly attacks on foreign-owned stores in Johannesburg triggered reprisal assaults on South African businesses in Nigerian cities.
