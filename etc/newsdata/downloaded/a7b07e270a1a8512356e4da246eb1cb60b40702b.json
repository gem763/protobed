But his top supporters in the business community have done something else: remained near-uniformly silent.\n\nYahoo Finance contacted 37 prominent business leaders, many of them allies of Trump, some of whom have contributed tens of millions of dollars to his presidential campaigns and provided him with economic advice.\n\nThree of the backers criticized the impeachment inquiry \u2014 while the vast majority of Trump\u2019s wealthiest and most well-known supporters passed up the opportunity to defend him.\n\nBlackstone (BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon \u2014 both of whom served on one of Trump\u2019s since-disbanded business advisory councils \u2014 declined to comment through spokespeople. The same response came from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who along with his wife Miriam contributed $20 million to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, hedge fund tycoon Robert Mercer and Related Co. Chairman Stephen Ross did not respond to multiple requests for comment. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink, who also served on one of Trump\u2019s business advisory councils, did not respond to a request for comment either.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the InterContinental Barclay hotel during the United Nations General Assembly, Monday, Sept. 23, 2019, in New York.

In subsequent days, the Trump administration released a rough transcript of the call and a whistleblower complaint filed in its aftermath.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, The New York Times reported that 223 members of the House back an impeachment inquiry, giving it majority support in that chamber.\n\nBusinessman Sheldon Adelson (L) and Republican candidate for Vice President Mike Penceapplaude before the first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York on September 26, 2016.
