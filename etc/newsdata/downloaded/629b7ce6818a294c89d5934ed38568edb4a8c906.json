Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and likened her politics to those that caused the Cambodian genocide.\n\nNew Faces GOP funded the ad, which features Elizabeth Heng, a Republican who lost a bid for a Fresno-area congressional seat last year.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nOcasio-Cortez responded on Twitter, calling the ad a \u201clove letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist base.\u201d\n\nKnow that this wasn\u2019t an ad for young conservatives of color \u2013 that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP\u2019s white supremacist case. https://t.co/zvp1EB02c5 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 13, 2019\n\nIn the ad, Heng calls Ocasio-Cortez \u201cthe face of socialism and ignorance.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father was minutes from death in Cambodia, before a forced marriage saved his life,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s socialism. Forced obedience, starvation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine is a face of freedom,\u201d she continues. \u201cMy skin is not white, I\u2019m not outrageous, racist, nor socialist. I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d\n\nCritics blasted ABC for agreeing to run the ad.\n\nQuestion for ABC Network. Would you run an ad if some Dems ran the same ad on socialism if it was replaced by racism or nazi ideology. Don't you have any standards for truth in ads? \u2014 Joe Lockhart (@joelockhart) September 13, 2019\n\nThis is the ad @ABC allowed to run during tonight's #DemDebate: right-wing propaganda depicting @AOC set on fire, burning into images of skeletons. This is right out of the white nationalist playbook. No news network should be profiting off such hatred.pic.twitter.com/11g7k6hf3c \u2014 Bend the Arc: Jewish Action (@jewishaction) September 13, 2019\n\nHeng also used images of the Cambodian genocide in her political ads last year, which were temporarily blocked by Facebook. Some in the GOP touted Heng, a Cambodian-American millennial, as the party\u2019s answer to Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u201cHeng says she\u2019d enjoy debating Ocasio-Cortez on the House floor,\u201d the San Jose Mercury-News reported.\n\nHeng lost to Rep. Jim Costa by 15 points. Since then, she appears to have kept up her interest in Ocasio-Cortez. In June, she wrote an op/ed for the Fresno Bee about a Memorial Day scoreboard video aired by the Fresno Grizzlies, in which Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s image appeared alongside Fidel Castro and Kim Jong Un. The team apologized for the video and said it was an inadvertent mistake, but Heng defended it.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it, socialism is coming to America, and it is clear that those who criticize it, even accidentally, will be silenced,\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cWe need to speak up now \u2014 before we are no longer allowed to speak.\u201d\n\nNew Faces GOP had raised about $170,000 as of June 30, mostly from donors in the Fresno area. The video appears to have allowed Heng to fulfill her goal of debating Ocasio-Cortez, at least on Twitter. In response to Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tweet, Heng wrote: \u201cAre you really calling me a racist @aoc? I\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal?\u201d\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
