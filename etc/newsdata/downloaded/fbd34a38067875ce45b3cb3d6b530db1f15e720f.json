We\u2019ve had a hell of a run in doubles and to think we\u2019ve only played a handful of tournaments and we\u2019ve done a really good job this tournament and gone deep.\n\n\u201cDisappointing obviously. We would have loved to have won our first slam together but certainly a fortnight that we\u2019ve enjoyed.\u201d\n\nThe 23-year-old can console herself in the knowledge she will regain the world No 1 singles ranking on Monday.\n\nAnd despite the defeat, Barty also remains in strong contention to become the first player to qualify for both the singles and doubles at the year-end championships in China since Karolina Pliskova in 2016.\n\nBarty is already the only player to have secured her entry in singles and is now in ninth spot with Azarenka in the Race to Shenzhen, which features the top eight doubles pairings of the year.\n\nThe first-year duo will weigh up whether or not to push for doubles inclusion during the Asian swing.\n\n\u201cI think we just see how both of our bodies are and kind of reassess that,\u201d Barty said. \u201cObviously when we both play we want to make sure that we\u2019re 100% healthy and ready to go.\u201d\n\nNo woman has pulled off the singles and doubles double at the season-ending championships since Martina Hingis in 2000. Regardless of which way she goes, Barty will leave New York delighted with her performances at the 2019 majors.\n\n\u201cIt has been a great grand slam season,\u201d she said. \u201cI have made the second week in every grand slam, which is something that I am really proud of. It was a goal I set out at the start of the year and I think we have been very consistent across the whole year, which is the most pleasing thing.\n\n\u201cTo get back to No.1 is really exciting but it is certainly not something that I am thinking about right now. It\u2019s more about digesting what has just happened.\u201d", "description": "Ashleigh Barty plans to take stock before deciding whether or not to pursue a rare crack at winning both the singles and doubles titles at the WTA season-ending championships", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce983c4bae479e9bb43c7c79a613f5c2d5d94872/0_109_3261_1957/master/3261.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b31f4767b1869202e65107d08e29340a", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
