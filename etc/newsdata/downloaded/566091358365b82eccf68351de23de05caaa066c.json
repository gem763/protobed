Elizabeth Warren wants to earn the Latino community's vote, she has more work to do originally appeared on abcnews.go.com\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren sat down with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Oct. 17, for a candid conversation to pitch \"what's she's all about, up front, in a private setting,\" as sources told ABC News.\n\nThe closed-door talk lasted about an hour and the room\u2019s energy was friendly, sources said. And as Warren takes steps to grow her base of supporters, this was her \"first step in a longer conversation\" with members of the Latino community.\n\nWarren was one of two 2020 presidential candidates in the still-brimming field to meet with members of the CHC: the other, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nHer meeting came just after the fourth Democratic debate, where the congresswoman got the first taste of what it really means to be a presidential frontrunner with sharp questions slinging at her from all sides of the stage.\n\nDespite Warren's rise in the polls overall, she's lagging behind Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders when it comes to a key voting bloc: the Latino community.\n\n(MORE: Warren takes fresh heat in scattered Democratic debate: Analysis)\n\nRecent polls, such as the one published by Quinnipiac University on Oct. 14 - conducted right on the heels of the third democratic debate - and right before the fourth - show her almost neck-and-neck, even leading Biden on some issues, amid the general vote. But she's losing out by double digits when it comes to Latino voters.\n\nOne stark example: the Public Policy Institute of California\u2019s survey, puts Warren, Biden and Sanders all in play: 34% for Warren; 19% for Biden; 9% for Sanders. But a breakdown of support shows a gaping margin: among Latinos, where Sanders takes 39%; Biden has 21%; and Warren with just 5% of the support.\n\nFor perspective: Latinos are on track to be the largest nonwhite ethnic group eligible for the 2020 ballot box.\n\nIt\u2019s a deficit she\u2019ll have to make up, both in community outreach and infused throughout the lifeblood of her campaign, experts say if she hopes to take winning aim at an early state like Nevada -- or delegate rich Super Tuesday states like Texas and California.\n\n\u201cIf a candidate is looking to move up in a state like that, the Latino electorate is a big, big portion of the Democratic electorate. And that has potential - if a candidate catches on and there's a lot of enthusiasm,\u201d Mark Baldassare, president of PPIC, tells ABC. \u201cSo, I would think for Elizabeth Warren, this is you know something of a particular interest and concern.\u201d\n\nAnd Warren clearly seeing the work cut out for her - now sets about it. Sources tell ABC she has so far been circling her courtship of the Latino vote - but courting nonetheless. She\u2019s the only non-Texas candidate who\u2019s hired a state director, organizer Jenn Longoria; and she\u2019s netted key endorsements like Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez in San Diego, longtime labor leader, and chair of the state\u2019s Latino Caucus.\n\nAnd - sitting down with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\n\u201cIt's very smart for her to do this now... these are all good signals that she's moving in that right direction,\u201d pollster Matt Barreto of Latino Decisions. \u201cShe\u2019s hopefully getting advice from them, and then hopefully she implements it.\u201d\n\nThat advice, Barreto says, centering the issues important to Latinos in her platform - and ensuring they have more than a token seat at the table within her campaign.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s in that transition right now - it's an extremely important constituency group for her. And so she doesn't want to make it look like an afterthought,\u201d Barreto said. \u201cMy advice to her would be to incorporate that more so it becomes a natural part of the campaign\u2019s voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cCandidates need to be doing that outreach, they need to be laying that groundwork - the question is, what are you doing now so it doesn\u2019t look like you stumbled into it?\u201d Barreto said.\n\n\u201cYou have to invest in that outreach if you want the support to materialize. So the CHC is saying to everyone: don't say a few words in Spanish and then expect record Latino turnout. You have to invest in that. We have to get our share proportionate to our electorate - the same as you do for, you know - white suburban women.\u201d", "description": "Massachusetts Sen.
