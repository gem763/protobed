You would\u2019ve been a brilliant Posh,\u2019 Geri screamed.\n\nDivina was less convinced, saying: \u2018After you\u2019ve pointed and pouted, where the f*** are you going?\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s got a point\u2026\n\nAnd while Ru found the drag queen\u2019s comment hilarious, Geri looked decidedly awkward at the dig at her former bandmate.\n\nAsked to give a sample of her VB impression, Divina let rip \u2013 convincing Essex accent and all.\n\n\u2018Well I\u2019d really like to join you on the reunion, Geri,\u2019 she said, \u2018but I can\u2019t be a***d, I\u2019m a brand now.\u2019\n\nWell, we thought the comment was pretty funny, but Geri was seriously unimpressed, doing a grumpy pout until a genuinely surprised Divina responded: \u2018Was that a bit savage? Sorry.\u2019\n\n\u2018A little bit,\u2019 Geri replied.\n\nWell, we\u2019re sure Victoria would\u2019ve found it funny\u2026\n\nVictoria didn\u2019t join the other Spice Girls for the reunion tour (Picture: Ray Burmiston/Photoshot/Getty Images)\n\nFortunately, Divina just managed to skate by and avoid a spot in the bottom two, with Crystal facing off against Sum Ting Wong and sending the latter queen packing.\n\nHowever, in a surprising move, Geri re-joined Sum Ting in the Werk Room to congratulate her for getting this far in the competition.\n\n\u2018I just wanted to come and say hello to you because I thought you had such a great energy and it really came across, for me it did. I really connected with that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I thought you brought a lot of joy, so well done,\u2019 she continued to the teary drag queen, who could only get out the words: \u2018Geri Horner made me cry.\u2019\n\nTo be fair, we\u2019d respond the same.\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK continues on Thursday nights on BBC Three.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
