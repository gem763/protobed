He's seen with twins Rocco and Jay, 12, and Gia, six.\n\nThe beautiful video sees the Irish boyband lark about and play with their kids, and pick them up for hugs and kisses as they sing about how their parents protected them and they want to do the same.\n\nThe video also features throwback pictures of the lads with loved ones throughout their lives.\n\nThe kids also take centre stage to sing along to the powerful track from their forthcoming album Spectrum.\n\nMy Blood was co-written by Ed Sheeran and Steve Mac.\n\nTaking a break from X Factor live show rehearsals, Westlife\u2019s co-manager Louis Walsh, told Mirror Online: \"This is the best single from the new album. It is a brilliant, classic Westlife mid-tempo ballad.\n\n\"It means so much to the guys to have their families involved. The fans will love this video. Westlife are back. They\u2019re national music treasures. People have fallen in love with them all over again.\"\n\nThe boys added: \"My Blood has such beautiful lyrics. It is a powerful, heartfelt song which has such a strong meaning for all of us. The single reflects where we are at this time in our lives - raising children and starting families.\n\n\"This is our fourth single that has been co-written by Ed Sheeran and Steve Mac. It has been brilliant to work with them. My Blood is the prefect lead into our upcoming album Spectrum.\"\n\nMark has previously opened up to Mirror Online about becoming a dad for the first time.\n\nThe singer excitedly made the announcement while on stage with his band at Dublin's Croke Park as part of their Twenty Tour.\n\nAnd chatting exclusively to us backstage, Mark, 39, talked about starting a family.\n\nHe said: \"It just feels like the right time to start a family now. It is something that I\u2019ve always wanted to do but it has always been about timing.\n\n\"Cailean and I are really happy and now that I\u2019m in my late 30s and settled at home in Sligo, it is the right moment.\n\n\"The Westlife lads have all got nine kids between them, ours will be the tenth Westlife baby. What\u2019s been great about this recent tour is that all of the families have been involved, kids and all, running around backstage.\n\n\"It is different from the older days but it is just brilliant. Having everyone around us brings a fantastic energy. We\u2019ve had to set up a special family room for everyone at every stadium and arena we\u2019ve played at, it's been great. The Westlife kids have loved it I think.\"\n\n* Spectrum is out on November 15 - pre-order it here\n\n* Westlife are playing London's Wembley Stadium next year - click here for tickets\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
