But right now, the live broadcast of the match does not seem realistic.\"Given the high interest in the match, the unification ministry is going to set up two monitoring rooms - one at the Koryo Hotel where the South Korean players are staying and the other at the ministry to try to provide real-time updates.But that depends on what kind of communication channel the North will allow.Another way to learn about the match is to check the FIFA or Asian Football Confederation websites, but they provide limited information such as goals and substitutions.Pyeongyang also has not answered Seoul's calls to allow civilian spectators.The Taegeuk Warriors will compete in a hostile environment with tens of thousands of North Korean supporters in the stands at the Kim Il-sung Stadium.Taking a flight from Beijing to enter the North, the South Korean men's national football team are expected to have only one official practice at the Kim Il-sung Stadium on Monday evening.Tuesday's inter-Korean match is set to kick off at 5:30 PM, Korea time.Kan Hyeong-woo, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
