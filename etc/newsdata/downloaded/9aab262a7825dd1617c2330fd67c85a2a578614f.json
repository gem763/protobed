Bush nominated a capable midcareer diplomat to serve as the U.S. representative to NATO. In a welcome sign of bipartisanship, the diplomat was introduced to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee by Robert P. Casey Jr., a Democratic senator from Pennsylvania.\n\nCasey said the nominee \u201crepresents the very best of the U.S. Foreign Service,\u201d calling him a \u201cseasoned diplomat who advances the interests of his country without regard for politics or partisanship.\u201d\n\nThe hearing began with the nominated diplomat noting that his wife had gone to Occidental College with the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cWe overlapped,\u201d agreed the chairman, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois.\n\nThe diplomat, Kurt Volker, was back on Capitol Hill last week, 11 years after he became the NATO ambassador, and just days after resigning his most recent post as special envoy to the Ukraine. That had been his first government position since the NATO ambassadorship, and it has been a quite different experience, to put it mildly.\n\nVolker did not return to Capitol Hall last Thursday to receive plaudits from legislators for his work on the nation\u2019s behalf. Instead, Volker was there to provide closed-door testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on what knows about President Trump\u2019s efforts to have the government of Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Democrats see Volker as a critical link in the impeachment inquiry that began with a whistleblower\u2019s complaint over a July 25 phone call between Trump and the recently elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nTrump wanted Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s dealings in Ukraine, where he had served on the board of an energy company, which some on the political right have spun into an intricate and unfounded conspiracy theory, one that Trump himself has promoted. Volker said in his House testimony that Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wanted the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens, and that he warned Giuliani against pushing for such an investigation.\n\nUntil last week, most Americans had never heard Volker\u2019s name. That changed when Giuliani tweeted screen-captured images of texts Volker had sent him, resulting in the low-key diplomat emerging as a key figure in the impeachment probe now being led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. Volker resigned his unpaid post on Sept. 27, and on Monday also left the McCain Institute for International Leadership at Arizona State University, where he had served as executive director since 2012.\n\nVolker testified on Thursday, spending some nine hours on Capitol Hill, offering what some believe could be damning testimony. His testimony has not been made public, but text messages he exchanged with another American diplomat suggest that his main interest was in maintaining productive U.S. relations with Ukraine and supporting the Eastern European nation in its efforts to contain Russian aggression.\n\nRudy Giuliani (Photo: Jeff Neira/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images) More\n\n\u201cVolker did the best he could under a lot of pressure. He was mostly accurate,\u201d Giuliani told Yahoo News in a text message. He reiterated that as far as the Trump administration\u2019s efforts in Ukraine were concerned, \u201cno one did anything wrong,\u201d but that \u201cderanged\u201d media outlets were bound to nevertheless concoct an anti-Trump narrative.\n\nVolker is one of several diplomats and government officials caught up in the Ukraine inquiry. Others include Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, who appears to have played a key role in Trump\u2019s effort to push the Ukrainian investigation. The new director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, handled the original whistleblower complaint that sounded alarms about the Ukraine call; Democrats have charged that he did not sound those alarms soon enough.", "description": "Former Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker departs a closed-door deposition conducted by the House Intelligence Committee, Oct. 3, 2019.
