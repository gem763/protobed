The showdown saw \u201cCorn Pop,\u201d enemy of a rules-based society, pitted against lifeguard Biden, the proverbial thin line between anarchy and civilization.\n\nOr as Biden put it in one of his many versions of his own Iliad and in his many feigned accents and modulated voices, as a teenager he wished to work at a minority dominated pool because most African-Americans in 1962 had never met a white person before, especially the sort of tough hero like Joe Biden. Unfortunately, lifeguard Biden told off Corn Pop, the leader of \u201cthe Romans,\u201d for violating pool rules.\n\nCorn Pop promised to get Biden after work in the parking lot, and supposedly showed up with three thugs with \u201cstraight razors\u201d (for those of you born in the ages after the \u201crecord player\u201d these were single-edge shaving blades), deliberately left \u201crusty\u201d to ensure greater mayhem.\n\nNo problem, Biden went to his own Yoda, the pool\u2019s street wizened white mechanic. And, of course, the two bonded, given their white, blue-collar shared cred. His buddy then cut Biden \u201csix feet\u201d of chain to arm him for his duel to come.\n\nSuitably equipped, Biden strutted out to meet four black gang bangers with rusty razors. (\u201cYou might cut me, Corn Pop, but I\u2019m going to wrap this chain around your head before you do.\u201d)\n\nAs they readied to rumble, Biden first offered an apology for insulting Corn Pop\u2014one last chance to advert mayhem. The latter thought it wiser to accept this admission from the chain-bearing Biden. And the two became friends. Biden, remember, is well versed in chains, given that as an adult\u2014in his inner-city patois\u2014he later warned an audience of black professionals that should Mitt Romney be elected, he and his opulent cronies would \u201cput y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d\n\nBiden the epic bard has retold the Homeric Corn Pop tale several times with suitable formulaic variances, but the message again is multifold: working-class whites and inner-city blacks alike respect Biden, because he is, well, genuine\u2014a tough, no-nonsense guy who is always civilization\u2019s enforcer.\n\nSome no doubt will believe the \u201cCorn Pop\u201d yarn is no more real than was Cory Booker\u2019s \u201cT-Bone\u201d or Barack Obama\u2019s girlfriend in his recalibrated \u201cmythography.\u201d But Biden reminds audiences that the remodeled pool was later renamed after him, and we are left to speculate it might not have been just as thanks for the pork Biden brought home as a U.S. senator, but in honor of his mythical service decades earlier as a banty rooster lifeguard.\n\nBrave Biden vs. the Bully Boy\n\nAnother tale, of course, is of Biden the protector of vulnerable women and the weaker members of the Biden clan. Many of the trademark Biden virtues are once again apparent in this fish story\u2014the barely controlled Biden temper, the valiant solitary Biden squaring off against either more or bigger enemies, and the white knight Biden protecting civilization from barbarians.\n\nPerhaps it is better to let Beowulf Biden tell it as he did in June of this year to a women\u2019s charity:\n\nI remember coming back from Mass on Sunday. Always the big treat was, we\u2019d stop at the donut shop\u2026We\u2019d get donuts, and my dad would wait in the car. As I was coming out, my sister [Valerie] tugged on me and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the boy who kicked me off my bicycle.\u201d So I went home\u2014we only lived about a quarter mile away\u2014and I got on my bicycle and rode back, and he was in the donut shop.\n\nOnce Biden saw his opening he took it:\n\nI walked up behind him and smashed his head next to the counter . . . I\u2019m not recommending it . . . His father grabbed me, and I looked at his son and said, \u201cIf you ever touch my sister again, I\u2019ll come back here again and I\u2019ll kill your son.\u201d Now, that was a euphemism. I thought I was really, really in trouble . . . My father never once raised his hand to any one of his children\u2014never once\u2014and I thought I was in trouble. He pulled me aside and said, \u201cJoey, you shouldn\u2019t do that, but I\u2019m proud of you, son.\u201d\n\nSo do not mess Biden, who, in extremis, was always capable of killing the bastards who needed killing. And he also can offer smaller, toned down lyric admonitions of his epic battles on behalf of women, as recently on the stump when the veteran of the gender wars reminded the brothers of an apparently attractive teenage girl, that caught Biden\u2019s wandering eye, \u201cYou\u2019ve got one job here, keep the guys away from your sister.\u201d\n\nBrave Biden vs. the World\n\nDo we remember when Biden took on all of the Ukraine on our behalf, or at least in defense of his son\u2019s crass efforts to leverage father Joe\u2019s name and office as vice president to rake in some foreign cash?\n\nAnd I remember going over [to Ukraine], convincing our team, our leaders to\u2014convincing that we should be providing for loan guarantees. And I went over, I guess, the 12th, 13th time to Kiev. And I was supposed to announce that there was another billion-dollar loan guarantee. And I had gotten a commitment from Poroshenko and from Yatsenyuk that they would take action against the state prosecutor. And they didn\u2019t. So they said they had\u2014they were walking out to a press conference. I said, nah, I\u2019m not going to\u2014or, we\u2019re not going to give you $1 billion. They said, you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. The president said\u2014I said, call him. (Laughter.) I said, I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the $1 billion. I said, you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said: I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money. Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\n\nBiden was one again the tough guy hero of the vignette who snapped a nation to attention with a single threatening sentence. Yet Biden left out the critical subtext that the special prosecutor (the non-\u201csolid\u201d one) he got fired was investigating\u2014 inter alia the shenanigans of his own son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly receiving funds from Ukrainian officials for hoped for favorable reciprocal American consideration.\n\nBiden, remember, is \u201cthe real deal,\u201d not the faux bully like Donald Trump. What might happen if Biden-Achilles ever met Trump-Hector? Biden on two occasions told us. Here are the shorter 2016 and longer 2018 versions:\n\n\u201cThe press always asks me, don\u2019t I wish I were debating him? No, I wish I were in high school, I could take him behind the gym. That\u2019s what I wish.\u201d \u201cThey asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, \u2018If we were in high school, I\u2019d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him . . . I\u2019ve been in a lot of locker rooms my whole life. I\u2019m a pretty damn good athlete . . . Any guy that talked that way was usually the fattest, ugliest S.O.B. in the room.\u201d\n\nAll the Biden formulae are here: violence on behalf of the weak, the courageous vigilante service for society, and preference for action rather than verbal dalliance.\n\nMost recently, Biden managed to recite another fable that even his liberal supporters found was demonstrably false in its details, a mostly a stitched together fable of mangled truths and utter fiction.\n\nHere is the Washington Post\u2019s version of Biden trip to Afghanistan to decorate an American combat hero:\n\nSome told him it [the trip] was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off their concerns. \u201cWe can lose a vice president,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke.\u201d The Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back. Now the general wanted Biden to pin a Silver Star on the American hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure. \u201cHe said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t want the damn thing!\u2019\u201d Biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. \u201c\u2019Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died!\u2019\u201d \u201cThis is the God\u2019s truth,\u201d Biden said while telling the story, adding a strange promise: \u201cMy word as a Biden.\u201d\n\nExcept that it was neither God\u2019s truth nor was the word of a Biden worth much.\n\nThe Post concluded that little of Biden tale was true. Or as the paper put it, after \u201cinterviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials,\u201d [Biden] \u201cgot the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch and the rank of the recipient wrong, as well as his own role in the ceremony.\u201d\n\nYet the Post should not be too surprised because Biden\u2019s false memories always have constant and predictable elements, as we see in this fable that emphasizes the courageous Biden risking death to travel to war-torn Afghanistan to personally pin a medal on a fellow hero. All that was different this time around was that Biden composed his epic from recent events whose names, dates, and places could be fact checked in a way the donut shop owner and his Corn Pop heroics could not be checked.\n\nBiden the Fabulist\n\nStrangest, saddest\u2014and most disturbing\u2014of all Biden\u2019s self-referential epics was his repeated narrative that the tragic deaths of his first wife and daughter were due to a careless drunk driver, who \u201cdrank his lunch\u201d\u2014an utterly false and damning accusation. Or as The Atlantic related in a 2010 profile:\n\nFor many years, he described the driver of the truck that struck and killed his first wife and their daughter in December 1972 as drunk, which he apparently was not. The tale could hardly be more tragic; why add in a baseless charge? The family of the truck driver has labored to correct the record, but Biden made the reference to drunkenness as recently as 2007, needlessly resurrecting a false and painful accusation.\n\nWhy did Biden add in the scurrilous charge? Because as a fabulist, he is always the center of both heroism and tragedy, and as bard he is not above stitching together myths to enhance his own suffering, ordeal, and indomitable spirit.\n\nTo the degree there are explanations for these myths, Biden likes to remind us he is not a career politician who became a multimillionaire grandee, but is still good ol\u2019 Joe, the \u201cpretty damn good athlete\u201d from Scranton way, the sole progressive who can talk turkey with the white working class, the tragic hero who steps out from the timid crowd to confront the lynch mob, the man of action who has no time for obfuscation and temporizing when a head smash, a good licking, a chain swat, or a diplomatic threat cuts to the quick.\n\nBut it is not so simple. There is a price to pay for such mock gallantry of our stock hero Biden risking injury or death by an adult small business owner, or about to be swarmed by razor-wielding toughs, or risking a one-on-one behind the gym, or indifferent to being downed in the badlands of Afghanistan, or, yes, tormented by the callous act of a felonious drunk driver. The mythical Biden is always a hero to his all too real valet, Biden the politician.\n\nYet, these Walter Mitty constructions are not mere memory lapses. They are more than the natural embellishments of habitual storytellers. And they are not even campaign episodes to puff up the candidate in the manner that all politicians lie to some degree.\n\nThe pathological yarns usually do not just glorify Biden but also denigrate others who likely were not culpable and certainly not around on stage to set the record straight.\n\nThe real heroic veteran in Afghanistan becomes a secondary prop to Biden\u2019s ego, the innocent truck driver lives with the stigma of a killer from the Biden smear, and the Ukrainian prosecutor is exposed as a crook. In that sense, the madcap adventures of young and old Joe are creepy, with winners like himself and smeared losers\u2014the verbal versions of the mute victims of Joe\u2019s hugs, squeezes, and hair blowing.\n\nThe zero-sum Biden script in these fictions is the same: the flipside of the apotheosis of Joe Biden is always the demonization or depersonalization of some silent other, without Joe\u2019s Biden influence and reach.\n\nJoe Biden reminds us that losers sometimes compose history.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1170064547.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
