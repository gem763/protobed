I see a bunch of new faultlines emerging which are increasingly important at the ballot box,'' she will say.\n\nThese faultlines include, but are not limited to, the digital divide, division over globalism, and the widening generational gap in which younger people feel locked out of the life enjoyed by older generations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"As new divisions open up, society is fragmenting into smaller and more zealous groups, more susceptible to populism,'' she will say, adding that it was becoming harder for political parties \"to keep everyone on the same page''.\n\nA new narrative\n\nSo fragmented has it become, that the political maxim of \"it's the economy, stupid'' is now rivalled by cultural issues when it comes to how people vote.\n\nMs O'Neil says wage stagnation is the defining problem in all developed economies.\n\n\"As the Fourth Industrial Revolution takes hold, more economic rewards are landing at the top of the labour market and with owners of capital, and not enough to the middle and bottom,'' she will say.\n\n\"Fairly managing transitions like this one is core business for labour parties like mine.\n\n\"And yet at the very moment when it feels as if we should be the trusted voice, voters are drifting away.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address this, she says Labor needs a new economic narrative.\n\n\"Since the 1980s, Labor\u2019s economic approach has been to grow the economy by opening it up. With a fair labour market and a good education system, all boats would rise together. That worked for 30 years,'' she says.\n\n\"Today, that model is broken. For the first time, our country is getting richer but ordinary families are going backwards.\"\n\nQuestioning assumptions\n\nMs O'Neil also says Labor must have a \"conversation'' about political correctness.\n\n\"One of the most upsetting things I have heard in speaking with people after the election \u2013 especially in the regions \u2013 was how we sounded on the doorstep,'' she says.\n\n\"I understand and acknowledge that some people say political correctness has gone too far as cheap cover for racism and bigotry. That is undoubtedly true.\n\n\"But when our own people \u2013 Labor people of a lifetime \u2013 tell us that they feel they are not allowed to question new social standards that seem to be reset every other week, I think we need to listen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Not everyone with a concern about the immigration rate is a bigot. Not everyone with a hesitation about changing gender roles is sexist. Not every social change is inarguably a good one.\n\n\"And if Australians feel they can\u2019t question assumptions and positions in conversation with us, they will find someone else to talk to about it.\"\n\nMs O'Neil laments a developing culture in the progressive movement where membership is granted with a box of ideas.\n\n\"And if you don\u2019t accept one of the ideas in the box, you do not merely have a different opinion, you are obviously wrong, probably stupid and possibly subhuman.\"\n\nMs O'Neil will also argue that government \"is not the answer to every problem in society\".\n\nAnd where it is, \"tens of billions of dollars in new government spending is not always the solution\".\n\n\"We forget sometimes, I think, government\u2019s convening power, and how much can be achieved by setting the rules, and clearly articulating the mind, mood and direction of the nation,'' she will say.", "description": "The Labor frontbencher says the traditional norms which have governed political behaviour no longer exist and the party must undertake a fundamental revamp.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_25/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/967e8b06cb877b191940ac8672d6c69e03ecf3ef", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
