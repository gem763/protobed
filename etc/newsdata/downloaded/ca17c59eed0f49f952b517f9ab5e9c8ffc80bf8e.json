Now, the Stauer family\u2019s new home is being threatened by the Kincade fire and the family is once again forced to evacuate and bracing themselves for more loss.\n\n\u201cWhen we left the last time ... we had five minutes,\u201d said Nick Stauer. \u201cPower's out, people knock on the door, we got ash hanging down. I\u2019ve got to wake up two teenagers. \u2026 I yell [at] them and of course they don\u2019t wake up because it\u2019s 2:30 in the morning. I yell at them again, they both get out of bed, grab one thing that\u2019s important,\u201d he recalled.\n\nTheir current home is brand new. It\u2019s in the same neighborhood as their previous home and they only moved in three months ago.\n\nNick said he\u2019ll never forget the moment he walked up to his previous house and found only a chimney and foundation left of his home. This time around, though, the family is more prepared.\n\n\u201cI feel safer. I feel they gave us so much warning. I feel that everybody really took what happened not only in 2017 but what happened in Paradise in 2018,\u201d said Stephanie Stauer.\n\n\u201cI felt that they took those learnings and were able to implement them and give us time to get out in a less harried less frantic way so that I could take out what was most meaningful,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hate to say it, we\u2019re experienced. You shouldn\u2019t be experienced in something like this. But we are and we\u2019ll take what we\u2019ve learned and even next time around, there's things that we learned from this time that\u2019ll be better. ... We\u2019re veterans now,\u201d said Nick.\n\n(MORE: Thousands forced to flee as Getty Fire threatens Los Angeles)\n\nPHOTO: Stephanie and Nick Stauer lost their Sonoma County home in the 2017 Tubbs Fire. Now, they are evacuating their new home as it is threatened by the Kingcade Fire. (Stephanie Stauer ) More\n\nThe couple and their family members have been staying at a KOA campground in Petaluma. There are seven people in all, including their two children -- a son and daughter -- and Stephanie\u2019s brother-in-law, niece and nephew who evacuated from another area.\n\nThere are also pets -- two cats and two dogs in two cars.\n\nThey had to go back to the home they fled to get more supplies. They needed blankets, more dog supplies, water and more food. There are a lot of mouths to feed and food is running out at local area fast-food restaurants.\n\nThe Stauers stand to lose many valuable possessions if their home burns down. They have new furniture in the front room, a new bed, new TVs and more.\n\nNick says they learned a lot of lessons and told their friends to video and record their house and store the footage in the cloud for insurance.\n\nStill, losing their home last year and the possibility of losing a second one is taking a toll.\n\n\u201cWe are both Sonoma County natives,\u201d said Stephanie. \u201cWe were born and raised in Petaluma, and this is the first time as this event is unfolding that we\u2019ve seriously had the conversation of it might be time to really reconsider leaving here,\u201d she said.\n\n(MORE: Kincade Fire stoked by fierce winds prompts new evacuations, threatens thousands of homes in Northern California)\n\n\u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to leave ... I love it. This is our home. .. But I can\u2019t do this every two years. I went through a stroke at 37, I suffered breast cancer at 40, my house burned down at 47 and at 49, we\u2019re here again.\u201d\n\nDespite losing precious family items, including a hand-carved desk made by her great-grandfather, her grandma\u2019s bible and more family heirlooms, the Stauers remain focused and hopeful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a glass half-full kind of guy. I don\u2019t live in fear. This is going to happen. We know what we have to do. Let\u2019s get out, we\u2019ll take what\u2019s important, I have my family. I have my wife,\u201d said Nick.\n\nStephanie also commented on the family\u2019s resiliency. \u201cOur motto has always been Stauers bend, we don\u2019t break. And we have bent a lot in our 24 years. We have been through a lot of medical issues and natural disasters, but that has been our motto and it continues to be,\u201d she said.", "description": "Now, the Stauer family\u2019s new home is being threatened by the Kincade fire and the family is once again forced to evacuate and bracing themselves for more loss.  \u201cWhen we left the last time ... we had five minutes,\u201d said Nick Stauer.
