The Italian city is like no other, a maze of canals and winding streets packed with history, fine art, good food and luxury hotels. But it has long been a victim of its own popularity. All but around 50,000 of its residents have fled, driven out by rising rents and heaving crowds. Those that remain are resentful that their home exists only to serve the 70,000 or more tourists that arrive each day, many on cruise ships or coach tours.\n\nMeasures have already been put in place to tackle the issue, but action is becoming increasingly drastic. From summer 2020, it was announced this week, all visitors will be required to pay a tourist tax of between \u20ac3 and \u20ac10. Fail to do so, and a fine of up to \u20ac450 could be the result. By 2022, in addition to paying the tax, tourists will have to make an online booking to enter Venice.", "description": "", "authors": ["Oliver Smith", "Digital Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2018/June/verona-bridge-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
