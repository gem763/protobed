According to Paula Fairfeld, a pretty convincing dragon.\n\nThose were just some of the key of ingredients the Nova Scotia-born sound designer used to create the layered and rich sounds of dragons and other mythical creatures in HBO's Game of Thrones.\n\nOver the years, Game of Thrones has won millions of fans and several Emmys, including Sunday's win for best drama. And this year, Fairfield and her colleagues took home the prize for outstanding sound editing.\n\nAs It Happens host Carol Off spoke to Fairfield about her award-winning sounds. Here is part of their conversation.\n\nPaula, big congratulations. How does it feel to be a two-time Emmy award winner?\n\nPretty surreal. It feels pretty awesome. It's been a long, winding road and a lot of hard work. But it's really nice to get acknowledged like that.\n\nFairfield says she used the sounds of a variety of other animals to craft the unique sounds of the dragons in HBO's Game of Thrones. (HBO)\n\nWhat are the sounds that you designed for Game of Thrones?\n\nI had the fabulous honour of doing all the fun stuff. My job was to do all the fantastical elements \u2014 so the dragons, the White Walkers, the wolves \u2014 kind of all the crazy stuff.\n\nAll the scary stuff, come on. Everything you just mentioned, I still have nightmares about.\n\nWell, the dragons aren't so scary always.\n\nPaula Fairfield, third from the left, with her Emmy for Outstanding Sound Editing.

So how did the sound of the dragons evolve in your creation?\n\nI actually came on in season three. So I took the dragons over when they were toddlers and it was fascinating because this was really the first time we've ever seen creatures that are kind of characters. They have to grow up over time.\n\nSo I had to kind of like literally grow the sound design for the dragons, which I didn't realize until like season five.\n\nI knew that I had to maintain the essence of their voices as they were young. Drogon, in particular, who was the lead and was the main dragon that we heard the most of.\n\nI'm quite proud of the fact that when you compare the later seasons with the earlier seasons, you can still hear an essence of the younger dragon in the older dragon.\n\nAt the same time, I had to keep adding things to kind of properly articulate the physicality of the dragons as it was changing \u2014 as they got bigger and bigger and bigger and as their emotional palette started to widen.\n\nWe were riding around on the dragons. The dragons were flying around, burning things down, doing all this stuff. There was a very emotional scene with Drogon and Dany at the end.\n\nI had to add more elements to be able to kind of articulate those emotions.\n\nYou could just have, I guess, created mechanical sounds, but they're not. To get that realism, you turned to nature. Where did you go to get the sounds that you incorporated into the dragons?\n\nOver the years, I've used a lot of different elements. By this season, there are approximately 30 animals or so that are part of the vocal palette.\n\nI used my dog Angel, who was this beautiful soul, very powerful creature, to actually add some elements to the dragons.\n\nI also went and recorded at White Oak conservatory in Florida. They have one of the largest rhino populations in North America. I recorded Mississippi sandhill cranes and a lot of other animals as well.\n\nAnd then, I had the fabulous opportunity to record these two orphaned bear cubs that were in rehab at the Cochrane Ecological Institute in Cochrane, Alberta.\n\nWe got a lot of breathing and snoring, and even some farting, and kind of play and tumbling, and all kinds of stuff \u2014 lots of shakes too, big old bear shakes.\n\nAnd that stuff made it in, in particular to that last scene with Dany and Drogon. These sniffs, these beautiful sniffs, and groans and pushes are from those bear cub cubs. As are the big, big shakes that Drogon does.\n\nWritten John McGill. Interview produced by Morgan Passi.
