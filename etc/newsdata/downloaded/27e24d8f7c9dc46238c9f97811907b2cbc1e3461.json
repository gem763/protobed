Sales grew in stores across the world and online, as well as across all its store brands, which include Pull&Bear, Massimo Dutti and Bershka as well as Zara. The company said it expected growth to continue at a similar pace, with its early autumn/winter collections being \u201cwell received\u201d.\n\nThe company said it had recently launched online stores in Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait and would do so in South Africa, Colombia and the Philippines this autumn.\n\nPre-tax profits rose nearly 9% to nearly \u20ac2bn in the most recent six months as total sales for the group rose to \u20ac12.8bn. However, the company\u2019s share price fell nearly 4% on Wednesday as investors were disappointed that profit margins did not rise.\n\nInditex\u2019s strong sales mark it out from many other struggling fashion retailers, including Topshop, New Look and Marks & Spencer.\n\nRichard Chamberlain, a retail analyst at RBC, said Inditex had a proven track record of sales outperformance and the latest half year was no exception. \u201cEven in its most mature market, Spain, Inditex achieved [underlying] sales growth of about 4%, ahead of the market\u2019s growth of 3%, albeit its degree of outperformance has narrowed compared to previous years,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sales at the Spanish group\u2019s established stores rose 5% in the six months to 31 July", "authors": ["Sarah Butler"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/755bad20048943eb8958a1c00c6ce0294003570a/0_793_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f0e05d525b2a5f2c9d9b9911ac96625", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
