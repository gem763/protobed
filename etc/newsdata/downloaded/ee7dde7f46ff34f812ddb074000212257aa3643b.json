A similar legal bid in Northern Ireland will be heard on Friday.", "description": "British Prime Minister abused his powers by seeking to suspend parliament from next week until shortly before Britain leaves the European Union, London's High Court was told on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426492254&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF840WA", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
