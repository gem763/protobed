It was the latest indication that President Donald Trump\u2019s signature diplomatic initiative has stalled.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe negotiation did not live up to our expectations and broke down,\u201d the chief North Korean negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, said, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Kim added that the United States had arrived \u201cempty-handed\u201d and had \u201cnot discarded its old stance and attitude.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe State Department, in a carefully worded statement, did not say the long-awaited session failed, and warned that the \u201cearly comments\u201d from the North \u201cdo not reflect the content or the spirit of today\u2019s 8 1/2 hour discussion.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cThe U.S. brought creative ideas and had good discussions\u201d with its North Korean counterparts, without specifying what they were.\n\n\n\nEager not to be cast as the obstacle to progress, the State Department also said its delegation previewed new proposals not only on denuclearization, but on other elements of the talks, which include a commitment to finding a formal end to the Korean War. State Department officials did not say how the North Korean negotiating team reacted.\n\n\n\nDespite the rosy statement from the U.S. side, it remained clear that discussions \u2014 which Trump had said were imminent after he briefly met Kim in the Demilitarized Zone in late June \u2014 got nowhere. And though the U.S. negotiators said they were willing to come back in two weeks, the North Koreans made no such statement.\n\n\n\nThe talks were the first detailed discussion between the two countries since Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, walked away from a summit meeting in Hanoi in February.\n\n\n\nThe outcome on Saturday was hardly surprising. Despite Trump\u2019s frequent optimistic statements about his relationship with Kim and what he has termed Kim\u2019s \u201cbeautiful letters\u201d to him, the North has accelerated its testing of missiles and added to its stockpile of nuclear fuel.\n\n\n\nOne objective of the new talks, according to some administration officials, was to test new proposals that would amount to a temporary freeze of nuclear activity, so that the North\u2019s capability did not increase while the talks drag on. Trump\u2019s failure to negotiate a freeze when he first met Kim in Singapore in June 2018 \u2014 the first meeting between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader \u2014 is considered by many experts to be a key flaw in his negotiating approach.\n\n\n\nA Vox report suggested the U.S. negotiating team would call for a three-year suspension of United Nations sanctions on North Korean coal and textiles in return for shuttering a major nuclear site and halting some types of fuel production.\n\n\n\nIt is not clear if the new talks even broached these or other proposals in any detail. The State Department\u2019s chief negotiator, Stephen Biegun, has said little about the specifics of U.S. proposals, other than making it clear they involved a more step-by-step approach to denuclearization than the all-or-nothing strategy Trump had used.\n\n\n\nIn recent days, one of Trump\u2019s former national security advisers, John R. Bolton, delivered a stinging appraisal of Trump\u2019s approach without ever naming the president, who fired him a month ago.\n\n\n\nBolton said he believed that Kim had no intention of ever giving up his weapons, a statement largely in accord with years of U.S. intelligence estimates dating to before Trump was elected. Bolton said added that there was little use in the negotiations. Bolton was excluded from the talks at the end of his time in office, apparently because Trump believed Bolton\u2019s hawkish views were more likely to lead to a conflict than to a negotiated settlement.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the North Koreans will ever voluntarily give up enough\u201d to make the negotiations fruitful, Bolton said last Monday at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cThere is no basis to trust any promise that regime makes.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s theory has been that the issue can be solved only by direct meetings between the leaders of the two nations, since decades of lower-level talks either broke down or resulted in agreements that fractured apart within a few years. The most notable success came from a 1994 agreement struck by the Clinton administration, more than a decade before the North tested its first nuclear device. Even that agreement fell apart soon after Bush was inaugurated, after the United States and South Korea caught the North secretly pursuing uranium enrichment, one of the two pathways to building a nuclear weapon. Every effort that followed collapsed more quickly.\n\n\n\nKim, sensing Trump\u2019s desire for summit meetings that attract intense coverage, may be betting that Trump needs a breakthrough before next year\u2019s presidential election. As a result, he may be testing to see how little of his program he can give up in return for the Trump administration agreeing to lift the onerous sanctions that have squeezed North Korea\u2019s export revenues for the past three years.\n\n\n\nIn Hanoi, Kim proposed closing down the country\u2019s main nuclear production facility at Yongbyon in return for an end to those sanctions. Trump, while tempted to accept the deal, was persuaded otherwise by Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that he would be accused of leaving the North with production facilities outside of the Yongbyon plant, and with an arsenal of 30 to 60 weapons.\n\n\n\nThe two leaders walked away from Hanoi, Kim\u2019s negotiators were fired, and talks were in abeyance until the new team arrived in Stockholm on Friday.\n\n\n\nIt is possible they will resume soon, after this initial testing of the waters. But in an essay posted on the Foreign Affairs website, Ankit Panda and Vipin Narang, two North Korea experts, note that \u201cPyongyang has set a very clear deadline \u2014 the end of this calendar year \u2014 for getting negotiations back on track and for the United States to moderate its position.\u201d After that, they suggest, Kim could be back to intense testing, betting that Trump would not risk a conflict in the midst of a presidential campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The first negotiations in eight months between the Trump administration and North Korea aimed at breaking the logjam over dismantling the North's nuclear program broke down only hours after they began in Stockholm on Saturday, the North Koreans said.
