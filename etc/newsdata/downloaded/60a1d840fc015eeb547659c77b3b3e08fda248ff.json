Repeated bullying can cause physical and/or psychological harm. Here are some strategies that can help.\n\nSchool Bullying and the Strategies to Help Your Kids\n\nDisturbing pictures show how a Jewish schoolboy was forced to kiss the shoe of a Muslim boy or face a vicious beating at the hands of nine other children who ganged up on him in a Melbourne park.\n\nShocking photos and videos of the incident have been shared on social media and the 12-year-old victim\u2019s parents say no disciplinary action has been taken against the group of boys involved.\n\nHis horrified parents told The Australian Jewish News (AJN) that just days after the incident, their son was beaten by another student \u2014 leaving him so terrified he wasn\u2019t willing to go back to school.\n\nIn separate incident, a five-year-old boy was allegedly called a \u201cJewish cockroach\u201d and \u201cdirty Jew\u201d, and was repeatedly hounded in the school toilets by his classmates, AJN reported.\n\nHis parents told the newspaper he was mocked about his circumcised penis so badly that he wet himself instead of using the toilet.\n\nThe boys \u2014 who attended Cheltenham Secondary College and Hawthorn West Primary school respectively \u2014 have moved schools, according to The Age.\n\nThe five-year-old\u2019s mother told the newspaper language used against her child by the bullies mirrored the anti-Semitic language of the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cI grew up with Holocaust survivors. I used to go to synagogue with my uncle, who was a Holocaust survivor, and those were the words, literally, he was taunted with when he was five,\u201d she said.\n\nThe shocking incidents have stoked fears that anti-Semitic bullying in Aussie schools is on the rise \u2014 with a Jewish leader telling news.com.au Australia is facing a \u201ccrisis of huge proportions\u201d.\n\nAnti-Defamation Commission chair Dvir Abramovich said the incidents were \u201conly the tip of the iceberg\u201d and there was an \u201cexodus of young Jewish people out of the public school system\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo child should be singled out and victimised simply because of their faith, and the fact that this is happening on a daily basis is shameful and outrageous,\u201d he told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cTo think that in 2019 Jewish pupils are subjected to violence, verbal insults and taunts, bigoted jokes, social exclusion, demeaning text messages and malicious Facebook posts is heartbreaking.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, there is mounting evidence that families are forced to take their children out and to enrol them in Jewish-day schools due to a growing sense of insecurity and fear that their kids will be harmed simply because of who they are. The kids are shaken and traumatised.\u201d\n\nA Department of Education spokesperson said anti-Semitism was taken \u201cvery seriously\u201d and \u201chas no place in our community or our schools\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll students have the right to feel safe and supported by their school,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe put in place supports for all students who are affected in incidents of aggression and violence in schools.\u201d\n\nIt is understood Cheltenham Secondary College undertook disciplinary action against the boys involved, while the incidents at Hawthorn West Primary school have been investigated by staff.\n\nJames Merlino Victoria\u2019s Deputy Premier and Minister for Education said the incidents are \u201cappalling\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am still very concerned by the parents\u2019 reports and I have asked for an immediate review into how both schools have handled these matters, to ensure they were dealt with appropriately,\u201d he said.\n\nNews.com.au has contacted both schools for comment.", "description": "Disturbing pictures show how a Jewish schoolboy was forced to kiss the shoe of a Muslim boy or face a vicious beating at the hands of nine other children who ganged up on him in a Melbourne park.", "authors": ["Ben Graham"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b363a607d676eaa9853a128be7ab5002?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
