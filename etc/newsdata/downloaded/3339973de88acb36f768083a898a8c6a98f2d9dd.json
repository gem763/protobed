We are in the business of bringing to market the best cannabis products possible and making them accessible to as wide an audience of patients and adult use consumers as is viable,\u201d Acreage CFO Glen Leibowitz said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAcreage Holdings never intended to be a real estate company, and as the cannabis industry is a capital-intensive business, tying up capital that can be deployed elsewhere is not in our shareholders' best interest. By working closely with GreenAcreage, we will be able to focus on our core competencies: growing the plant, processing it into consumer/medical products and building out a network of retail locations across the country.\u201d\n\nAcreage shares were down 0.33% at $5.98 at the close Monday.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nAcreage CEO Kevin Murphy: Drop In Cannabis Stocks Isn't The End Of The Run\n\nCanopy Growth CEO Talks Leadership Concerns, Vaping, Beverages, Acreage Deal\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
