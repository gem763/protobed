Music filling the brownstone. Black fingers pulling violin bows and strumming cellos, dark lips around horns, a small brown girl with pale pink nails on flute. Malcolm\u2019s younger brother, his dark skin glistening, blowing somberly into a harmonica. A broad\u2010shouldered woman on harp. From my place on the stairs, I could see through the windows curious white people stopping in front of the building to listen. And as I descended, the music grew softer, the lyrics inside my head becoming a whisper, I knew a girl named Nikki, guess you could say she was a sex fiend.\n\nNo vocalist. The little girl didn\u2019t know the words. The broad\u2010shouldered woman, having once belted them out loud while showering, was now saved and refused to remember them. Iris wouldn\u2019t allow them to be sung and Malcolm\u2019s brother\u2019s sweet seven\u2010year\u2010old mouth was full. Still, they moved through my head as though Prince himself were beside me. I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.\n\nAnd in the room, there was the pink and the green of my grandmother\u2019s sorority, the black and gold of my grandfather\u2019s Alpha brothers\u2014gray\u2010haired and straight\u2010backed, flashing gold\u2010capped teeth and baritone A\u2010Phi\u2010A! as I made my entrance. High\u2010pitched calls of Skee\u2010wee answering back to them. Another dream for me in their calling out to each other. Of course you\u2019re gonna pledge one day, my grandmother said to me over and over again. When I was a child, she surprised me once with a gift\u2010wrapped hoodie, pale pink with My Grandmother Is An AKA in bright green letters. That\u2019s just legacy, Melody, she said. I pledged, your grandfather pledged\u2014\n\nIris didn\u2019t.\n\nA pause. Then quietly, her lips at my ear, That\u2019s because your mama isn\u2019t legacy.\n\nThis, I whispered back to her, quoting her sorority mantra, is a serious matter.\n\nMy grandmother laughed and laughed.\n\nThe dress, Iris\u2019s dress, unworn in her closet until that moment. Already, when it was time for her ceremony, I was on my way. Already, at nearly sixteen, her belly told a story a celebration never could.\n\nLook back at me on that last day in May. Finally sixteen and the moment like a hand holding me out to the world. Rain giving way to a spectacular sun. Its rays speckling through the stained glass, dancing off the hardwood floors. The orchestra\u2019s music lifting through the open windows and out over the block as though it had always belonged to the Brooklyn air. Look at me. Hair flatironed and curling over my shoulders. Red lipstick, charcoaled eyes. The dress, Iris\u2019s dress, unworn in her closet until that moment. Already, when it was time for her ceremony, I was on my way. Already, at nearly sixteen, her belly told a story a celebration never could. My grandfather\u2019s oversize dress shirts backdropping the baby fat still pouting her cheeks, the fine lanugo hair still clinging to the nape of her neck. Still, that afternoon, the years that separated us could have been fifty\u2014Iris standing at the bottom of the stairs watching me. Me looking away from her. Where was I looking? At my father? My grandparents? At anything. At anyone. But her.\n\nEarlier that day, she came into my room as I pulled stockings over my thighs, attempted to clip them to an ivory gartered corset. These too had once belonged to her\u2014unworn, still boxed and wrapped with tissue paper. The fragile stocking struggling against being locked into the garter\u2014this I had learned from my grandmother\u2014 and she from her mother and on back\u2014mine the only ceremony skipping a generation of mothers showing daughters. This\u2014the corset wearing, the garters, the silk stockings\u2014was as old as the house my father and I shared with my grandparents. This ritual of marking class and time and transition stumbled back into the days of cotillions, then morphed and morphed again until it was this, some forgotten ancestor\u2019s gartered corset\u2014and a pair of new silk stockings, delicate as dust.\n\nI guess you win this round, she said. Prince it is.\n\nI looked up at her. The evening before she\u2019d twisted her hair into tight pin curls, and standing before me, she began to pull them loose, her thick reddish hair springing into coils down over her ears. The baby fat long gone from her cheeks, replaced by high, stunning bones. I pressed my hand against my own face, felt the same structure beneath my skin.\n\nI didn\u2019t know it was a competition, Iris.\n\nOnce, a long time ago, she was Mommy and I held her neck, her arms, her belly tight with dimpled baby hands. I remember that. How I reached and reached and reached for her. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.\n\nThe dress, white and unworn, lay spread out on the bed beside me. Behind it, a framed poster of Rage Against The Machine\u2019s 1997 concert. My father and I went because Wu\u2010Tang was opening. I was twelve then and the two of us yelled and rapped and cheered so hard, we both stayed home the next day drinking lemon\u2010honey tea to nurse our sore throats. The poster was professionally framed\u2014the red letters against a gray matte, the oversize black frame picking up the muted colors of the black\u2010 and\u2010white photograph. Beside it, another poster. If someone said choose between your mom and dad, I wouldn\u2019t need to blink. Wouldn\u2019t stutter. I\u2019d run like a little kid and jump into my daddy\u2019s arms.\n\nFeels like it\u2019s always a competition these days. Somewhere along the way, I became your enemy. She pressed her hand to her throat and held it there, her fingers gently moving across her collarbone as though she were checking to see if it remained intact. A gold bracelet slid down away from her wrist. Tiny diamonds catching the light. I swallowed, at once envying and adoring all the ways in which the word lovely could refer to my mother. So strange still, how different we were.\n\nI had given up on trying to negotiate the stockings into the ridiculous garters and was just sitting there staring at her, elbows on my thighs, hands hanging down.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. This is my ceremony and you\u2019re trying to be stuck about the music. You blew yours, remember\u2014\n\nNo, the baby in my belly blew mine. Remember?\n\nDon\u2019t even, Iris. Then for a moment, like so many times before this, I lost the words. Watched them drop \u2026 No. Dissipate \u2026 from the air between us. Dissipate. The word had shown up on my SAT prep tests again and again until it landed in this room with us. Between my mother. And me. Don\u2019t even. I didn\u2019t ask to be born. I didn\u2019t say\u2014I didn\u2019t say do what you and my dad were doing. You could have waited.\n\nIris raised an eyebrow at me. I know you\u2019re not trying to have some kind of abstinence conversation with me.\n\nYou could have. There wasn\u2019t some rush to do what you guys did.\n\nYou mean have sex? Can you really not even say it? Sex, Melody. It\u2019s just a three\u2010letter word.\n\nI can say it. I just don\u2019t need to right now.\n\nAnd if we had \u2026 waited, as you say. Where would you be?\n\nYou regret the hell out of me.\n\nDon\u2019t curse. I don\u2019t regret you. I couldn\u2019t imagine this world without you in it.\n\nThen what is it?\n\nShe came over to the bed, sat down on the other side of the dress, and ran her hand longingly over it. There were crocheted white flowers at the wrist. The attached train had alternating silk and satin panels. The seamstress had already been working on it for months before my grandparents found out Iris was pregnant. By the time she started showing, the dress was almost done and paid for.\n\nI don\u2019t know \u2026 , she said more to the dress than to me. It\u2019s Prince. It\u2019s my parents. It\u2019s your father. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s you already sixteen now. Where did all those years go? It\u2019s crazy.\n\nThere was a catch in her voice I didn\u2019t want to hear. Didn\u2019t want to deal with. Not now. Not on my day.\n\nIt\u2019s just Prince, for fuck\u2019s sake! It\u2019s not like I\u2019m asking to walk in to N.W.A. or Lil\u2019 Bow Wow\u2014\n\nStop cursing, Melody. You\u2019re better than that. And N.W.A., Lil\u2019 whatever \u2026 I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re saying. She didn\u2019t look at me, just continued to run her hand back and forth over the dress. We had the same fingers, long and thin. Piano fingers, people said. But only she played.\n\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s Prince. And it\u2019s my ceremony and he\u2019s a genius so why are we even still talking about it? You already nixed the words. Let me at least have the music. Daddy doesn\u2019t care. He likes Prince too.\n\nJeez!\n\nI wanted her to tell me I was beautiful, that she didn\u2019t care what music played, that she loved me. I wanted her to laugh with me about the ridiculousness of garters and stockings.\n\nFor too long we said nothing. There was something moving through me like a razor in my chest\u2014I didn\u2019t know then if it was rage or sadness or fear. Maybe Iris felt it too because she moved closer to me, rested her hand on the back of my neck, and pressed her lips into my hair. I wanted more, though\u2014a hug, a kindness whispered into my ear. I wanted her to tell me I was beautiful, that she didn\u2019t care what music played, that she loved me. I wanted her to laugh with me about the ridiculousness of garters and stockings.\n\nBut instead, she got up, went over to the window, and pulled the curtain back. She stared down at the block as she freed the rest of her curls. It was gray out, drizzling. Downstairs, the orchestra had arrived. I could hear bows being pulled across violins. Could hear my grandfather playing Monk on the piano and imagined his dark fingers, knotted at the knuckles.\n\nDo you like Malcolm?\n\nShe turned back to me. Her skin creased at the brow, her eyes\u2014eyes I\u2019d prayed for as a child, Please God let me wake up with Mommy\u2019s pretty amber eyes\u2014red\u2010veined now. Please God don\u2019t ever let me have eyes like her eyes are right now.\n\nMalcolm? Sure. Yeah. He\u2019s still such a sweetie. She looked at me, her mouth turning up into a half smile.\n\nWhat? What exactly are you asking me, Melody?\n\nDo you like him \u2026 for me? Do you think he\u2019s a good\u2014 I don\u2019t know.\n\nI looked up at her. Who else was there to ask who had lived through it all? From beginning to baby. First kiss to hands on a body to sex. How did you even begin it? Keep it going? Wasn\u2019t it supposed to be now that she gave me the answers. Told me everything?\n\nYou guys have known each other since you were in diapers and he\u2019s always been \u2026 I mean, isn\u2019t he?\n\nIsn\u2019t he what?\n\nNothing. Never mind. She put her hands up, surrendering. He seems, she said again, smiling. You just don\u2019t seem \u2026 his type.\n\nLike you would know anything about him. Or me.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019ve known that boy since he was in diapers.\n\nYeah, Iris. Both of us were in diapers a long time ago.\n\nMaybe all over the world there were daughters who knew their mothers as young girls and old women, inside and out, deep. I wasn\u2019t one of them. Even when I was a baby, my memory of her is being only halfway here.\n\nWe got quiet. Maybe all over the world there were daughters who knew their mothers as young girls and old women, inside and out, deep. I wasn\u2019t one of them. Even when I was a baby, my memory of her is being only halfway here.\n\nI hid you from them, you know, she said\u2014like she was looking into my head finally. Seeing something there. That\u2019s how you got here. They were hella good Catholics back then, but you would have been dust.\n\nFrom who?\n\nWhom, Melody. It\u2019s whom.\n\nI was starting to sweat beneath the corset.\n\nYour grandparents. Your beloved grandparents.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know. You told me you didn\u2019t know.\n\nI never said I didn\u2019t know. I said I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nShe stopped talking suddenly and looked at me. Hard.\n\nIs your period regular?\n\nWhat \u2026 yeah! What the heck, Iris?\n\nShe exhaled. Shook her head. Okay, so if you have a regular period and then it just stops and it\u2019s not stopping because you\u2019re suddenly a super athlete or something\u2014then you\u2019re probably pregnant. I\u2019m just saying that to you in case no one else does\u2014\n\nI covered my ears. I\u2019m good. Don\u2019t need to hear this. Not today. Not from you. Thanks.\n\nNo one ever said it to me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it to you. We can talk about this. By the time I was four months pregnant, what I didn\u2019t know was that on the other side of pregnancy there was Motherhood.\n\nOf course it was, I said. Of course it is, she said. I know that now.\n\nHow could you not know\u2014 You know what\u2014 Never mind. I don\u2019t get you.\n\nThe orchestra was warming up with \u201cJeannine, I Dream of Lilac Time.\u201d I could hear my grandfather singing the words along with Malcolm\u2019s little brother. One voice high. The other low. One voice young and unsure, the other old and clear and deep. I closed my eyes for a minute. The song was older than everyone in the house. When the trumpeter picked up a solo and the music lifted past where the voices had just been, I felt like my ribs were shattering. There was so much in all of it. Just. So. Much. I wanted to say to Iris, It all feels like it\u2019s trying to drift out into somebody\u2019s eternity. But when I looked up at her again, she was biting the edge of her thumbnail, her left eyebrow jumping the way it did when she was stressing.\n\nI told Aubrey, she said, moving her finger away from her mouth and studying it. And then both of us made believe it wasn\u2019t happening for a few months. Because we were kids thinking that if we ignored it, it would go away. I hid you until I couldn\u2019t anymore, wearing your granddad\u2019s button\u2010down shirts, telling him it was the style.\n\nDid you want to miscarry me?\n\nI was a child, Melody. I was younger than you are now! I wanted to see you born. I wanted to hold you. I was stunned that it was true\u2014that you could have sex with someone and that sex could make another human.\n\nI tried to imagine her in my grandfather\u2019s clothes. Everything about her was feminine and tailored and perfect. Everything about her felt the opposite of me. I could imagine me in my grandfather\u2019s clothes. But not her.\n\nI wanted you. I wanted you growing in my body, I wanted you in my arms, I wanted you over my shoulder\u2014\n\nShe got quiet.\n\nAnd then the wanting was gone, wasn\u2019t it?\n\nShe shook her head. More time passed before she spoke again.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t gone. Just different. You\u2019re going to learn this. I mean, I hope you learn this. Love changes and changes. Then it changes again. Today, the love is me wanting to see you in that dress, she said. I want to see me in you because Me in that dress was over a long time ago. Sixteen was gone. Then seventeen, eighteen\u2014all of it.\n\nI pulled the dress closer to me\u2014lace over silk and satin, tea length, mandarin collared. A tailor had cinched the waist and let out the hips. He\u2019d lifted the hem to see if there was extra fabric there to lengthen it. When there was only just enough, he used satin binding over the raw edge to squeeze the last of the length from it. My grandmother was so proud of his work. As I stood in his shop turning for the two of them, the tailor nodded approvingly and my grandmother dabbed at her eyes.\n\nIris turned back to the window. Silent again.\n\nMaybe this was the moment when I knew I was a part of a long line of almost erased stories. A child of denial. Of magical thinking.\n\nI stared at her back. Maybe this was the moment when I knew I was a part of a long line of almost erased stories. A child of denial. Of magical thinking. Of a time when Iris and my father wanted each other in \u2026 that way. The something they were so hungry for in each other becoming me. Me so in love with her that as a small child, I cried whenever my father put his arms around her. Said, She\u2019s mine, and cried harder when they laughed. A long line of screaming fights leading to us here now. Sixteen years of one or the other of us pushing away. She had won. Not me. Now, here was this, her standing with her back to me, hair half\u2010done, half slip and bra beneath her satin robe, a woman too often confused for my sister. Here she was, in all of her deep unknowing knowing that this was the place, this was the time to keep me here by letting me know how easy it would have been to stay fifteen. That the people I loved almost as much as I loved my own father would have determined me optional. Two words spoken early enough, I\u2019m pregnant, would have meant the end of my beginning. The end of so many beginnings.\n\nHer back was narrow and straight, her shoulders squared beneath the delicate satin of her robe. She was fourteen months away from her thirty\u2010third birthday. The age Christ was when he died, hung up on a cross and left to slowly bleed. In school, we\u2019d been asked to discuss this image\u2014Literal or Metaphoric. Truth or Fiction. It was Whitman who said, Argue not concerning God. At the time we were in ninth grade\u2014new to our beliefs and the power of our voices. So we argued. But now I knew there were so many ways to get hung from a cross\u2014a mother\u2019s love for you morphing into something incomprehensible. A dress ghosted in another generation\u2019s dreams. A history of fire and ash and loss. Legacy.\n\nThat evening, as the music lifted up, I made my way slowly down the stairs and into the crowded room. When I looked for Iris, I found her standing beside my father, him in black, her in dark blue. Her hand on the now flat belly that could have expelled me. As the orchestra lifted into \u201cDarling Nikki,\u201d I took small breaths to keep tears from coming. I had not expected this\u2014to feel the close of a chapter. The girlhood of my life over now.\n\nAmen. The end. Amen.\n\nCameras flashed as Malcolm took my hand, led me to the center of the gathered circle where my grandparents sat, somber and proud.\n\nThis was their perfect moment. Another almost\u2010erased history unaborted. And this house with its hundred\u2010plus years. This house with its stained\u2010glass and leaded windows. This house with its generations cheering, saying, Dance, y\u2019all and Ash\u00e9 and The ancestors are in the house, say what? I and everything and everyone around me was their dream come true now. If this moment was a sentence, I\u2019d be the period.\n\nThis house and these people, I kept thinking. This house and these people. Who the fuck were they anyway? I didn\u2019t know Iris. But truly, did I know any of them? Honestly? Deeply? Skin, blood, bone, and marrow?\n\nMalcolm put his arms around my waist, whispered in my ear, We so dark and lovely, got them feeling all black and blue.\n\nLook closely. It\u2019s the spring of 2001 and I am finally sixteen. How many hundreds of ancestors knew a moment like this? Before the narrative of their lives changed once again forever, there was Bach and Ellington, Monk and Ma Rainey, Hooker and Holiday. Before the world as they knew it ended, they stepped out in heels with straightening\u2010comb burns on their ears, gartered stockings, and lipstick for the first time.\n\nNow Malcolm lifts my hand as we begin a slow cakewalk while a trumpet blows Armstrong into the room. Malcolm smiles then winks at me, our legs kicking into the air then swinging back behind us. The rest of the court dancing onto the floor to join in\u2014our teenage feet in sync, our hands lifting into the air. Look how beautifully black we are. And as we dance, I am not Melody who is sixteen, I am not my parents\u2019 once illegitimate daughter\u2014I am a narrative, someone\u2019s almost forgotten story.
