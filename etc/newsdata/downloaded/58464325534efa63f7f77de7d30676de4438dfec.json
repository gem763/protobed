It also states it will not offer the digital currency in any jurisdiction until local regulatory concerns have been been addressed.\n\nThe social media giant told US government officials the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, euro, and US dollar likely would be the first bunch of currencies to back Libra, according to a Bloomberg report Tuesday.\n\nThe revelation emerged in its response to US senator Mark Warner's concerns that China might campaign to have the yuan included in the reserve fund backing the cryptocurrency. Warner noted that Beijing had urged governments to include the Chinese currency in their reserve holdings and asked that Facebook left it out of the Libra basket.\n\nRead this Why Singapore doesn't need Bitcoin The island will get its first Bitcoin ATM in March, but does it really need another currency which main appeal is the anonymity it offers, especially since Singapore is reportedly susceptible to money laundering?

It said it wanted Facebook to provide more details on Libra before deciding on whether there was need for new regulation.\n\nSenior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who oversees the country's central bank Monetary Authority of Singapore, said: \"It is in the early stages of development, with a number of issues to be worked out around its features, use cases, and governance arrangements. Like other regulators around the world, MAS will make an informed assessment of the potential benefits and risks of Libra once these details become clear.\"\n\nFacebook previously said Libra, slated for launch next year, would be integrated with the company's apps and services including a new digital wallet that would be integrated with Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp. It also would be made available as a standalone Google Android and Apple iOS app, potentially for use with third-party providers and e-commerce marketplaces.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "Social media giant has reportedly informed US government officials that the Singapore dollar, Japanese yen, and euro are amongst an initial bundle of global currencies that likely will be included in a reserve fund backing its cryptocurrency.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/01/03/f26afe95-3550-44ac-813e-e7cc792959f2/thumbnail/770x578/8aed4435a485d3bea154db73a875fd48/istock-bitcoin-and-other-currency.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
