She pointed to the story of a Georgia waitress who recently body slammed a customer who groped her, and received immediate support from the restaurant's manager and owner.\n\n\"She must have felt, 'I am in a world where my boss is actually is going to take this seriously. Maybe I'm even in a world where the police are going to treat this as assault,'\" Solnit said.\n\nSolnit just released a new book of essays, Whose Story Is This?: Old Conflicts, New Chapters, about the cultural shift around who gets to be at the centre of the stories we tell as a society.\n\nCentring marginalized voices\n\n\"We are in this incredible era of changing the story,\" she said, arguing that recent social movements like #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have helped hand the microphone to voices that typically haven't had power.\n\n\"The police shooting the unarmed black woman is going to be about the woman, and not about the cop,\" she said.\n\nSandy Hudson, Alexandria Williams and Yusra Khogali, co-founders of Black Lives Matter Toronto, at Pride Toronto in 2016. Black Lives Matter is one of the movements Solnit credits with helping create more space for marginalized voices. (Courtesy of Paige Galette)\n\nSolnit said that shift is causing \"a tremendous battle\" with people who have traditionally held the reins of power.\n\n\"We still have old white male judges who will treat a rape as how it affects the boy's future rather than the girl he raped,\" she said. \"The story of immigrants is focused not on the desperation and terror that makes people become refugees, but how it is for the people when they arrive, the mild discomfort or annoyance of strangers in your community.\"\n\nGreta Thunberg and the hero treatment\n\nSolnit also argued that as this cultural shift continues, storytelling \u2014 from Hollywood to journalism \u2014 needs to stop focusing on individual \"heroes\" and instead look at the underlying movements that have allowed those people to be propelled into the spotlight in the first place.\n\n\"The whole framework suggests ... that the rest of us are not heroes, that we're passive or wicked or helpless or confused and need to be saved,\" Solnit said.\n\n\"If you actually look at the most beautiful parts of our histories, it's mass movement, it's collectives, it's groundswells,\" she said. \"It's not the exceptional, but the ordinary people who change the world.\"\n\nSwedish activist and student Greta Thunberg, centre, takes part in the Climate Strike in Montreal on Sept. 27. (THE CANADIAN PRESS)\n\nSolnit pointed to how the media paints environmental teen activist Greta Thunberg as an individual hero, instead of looking at the decades of feminist and environmental activism, especially by Indigenous people, that helped lay the groundwork for more people to be open to hearing Thunberg's message.\n\n\"I think Greta is wonderful and amazing, but I think that she was in the right place at the right time. And what made it the right place? What made it the right time?\" she said.\n\n\"It's a collective engagement that created this space for her to be heard. And it's the people ready to listen to her.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
