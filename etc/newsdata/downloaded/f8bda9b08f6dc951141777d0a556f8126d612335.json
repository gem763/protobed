Photo: Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nBenjamin Hart and Reeves Wiedeman chat about the future and past of a magazine giant.\n\nBen: In your feature on Cond\u00e9 Nast published yesterday, you paint a picture of a company that has declined in stature (and revenue) considerably over the last few years, from its heyday of high-flying expense accounts and automatic prestige. After all your reporting, what do you think the general prognosis for the place is? Will Cond\u00e9 as we know it exist in 5, 10, 15 years?\n\nReeves: A grim question to start! I think many of Cond\u00e9\u2019s biggest brands \u2014 to use that terrible word \u2014 will continue to exist, and some may even thrive if they can find ways to adapt. Smaller brands will have to pull their weight, revenue-wise. Bon App\u00e9tit is an example of a place that has managed to remake itself from a magazine into a YouTube juggernaut with a magazine on the side. As we report, it seems like the Newhouse family would love to keep as many of the brands alive and together as they can, but they\u2019re also businesspeople, and it\u2019s conceivable that they might sell off some of the titles that aren\u2019t pulling their weight \u2014 as they did three times already this year, with W, Bridges, and Golf Digest.\n\nBen: The whole place was slow to really understand the internet, which has upended the entire magazine business. Do you think it\u2019s in a better place than it was a few years ago, when it was treating the online side of things as a kind of second-order concern?\n\nReeves: On the digital front, without question. There were some very severe growing pains over the past few years, especially as Cond\u00e9 struggled to get all the different magazines \u2026 err, brands, to allow a centralized Cond\u00e9 digital team try to build out a more robust platform for everyone, rather than each brand having its own team. But can you build a digital apparatus that meets the needs of The New Yorker and Teen Vogue and Wired? They\u2019re certainly in a much better place than they were on that front a few years ago, but Cond\u00e9 also got a much later start than many other media companies, and have been making up for it ever since.\n\nBen: The turmoil has obviously not been a great state of affairs for the people who work there \u2014 as you noted, simply being at Cond\u00e9 was once the goal for a lot of people, whereas now there are more frequent departures to go help run other publications or concerns, like Glossier, Snapchat, etc. And for those of us who work in media, there\u2019s definitely a sense of nostalgia that a once-great print empire is a shadow of its former self. But is the nostalgia perhaps also overstating what\u2019s being lost here? What is the actual cultural cost of not having all these magazines thriving at the same time? Is the more dispersed media ecosystem of 2019 really a downgrade?\n\nReeves: As a Cond\u00e9 employee \u2014 from a different magazine, the demise of which this person would undoubtedly lament to the heavens \u2014 put it to me, \u201cWas the world a worse place when Self went online-only?\u201d Probably not. Many Cond\u00e9 magazines were simply the information delivery vessel of a particular time, and an elite one at that. But Cond\u00e9 was among the places that spoke from a certain place of authority that I think all of us are starting to miss to some degree. Sometimes that authority was woefully out of touch with where society is today, but we\u2019re clearly only beginning to grapple with all the problems of a disaggregated media environment.\n\nTo take one relatively meaningless example, it was a lot easier to pick the cover subject for Vanity Fair when it was obvious who the A-List movie stars were. As Hollywood and the entertainment world has morphed \u2014 for the better in many, many ways \u2014 many Cond\u00e9 publications feel like they\u2019re playing catch-up as often as they\u2019re leading the conversation. That last point, of course, comes with the limitations of having your primary product only come out once a month!\n\nBen: Bring back the monoculture! I for one think people would probably be happier if there were no more than ten TV channels, a few good movies a year, a few magazines and books to read \u2026 not this endless stream of information that feels completely ungovernable. There\u2019s probably some nostalgia for that too, right?\n\nReeves: Totally! I was thinking about a comment someone much smarter than me made about how, even though we\u2019re in a Golden Age of TV, with a trillion shows to watch, that means that the best cinematographers and key grips and all the other jobs you need to make these things great are now spread across all those shows, and it\u2019s tough to pull the best of the best onto one individual show. We have more pretty good shows, and maybe less great ones. I\u2019m spitballing here, but, the same could be true of magazines: Vanity Fair was a good magazine in part because they just paid all the best writers a ton of money to work for them instead of anyone else. If you\u2019ve got 30 great writers and 3 of them turn in a great story every month, you can do something great. It\u2019s harder when you\u2019re trying to find those three stories from a smaller group of people. The difference of course being that, uh, no one is calling this the Golden Age of Magazines.\n\nBen: True, though The New Yorker, which seems to be the exception that proves the rule in the Cond\u00e9 universe, is still certainly playing its A game.\n\nThough, as we know, only New York Magazine can truly be thought of as \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\nReeves: Hear hear! The New Yorker\u2019s still doing great and important work that breaks through all the chatter \u2026 almost as often as New York does.", "description": "Will Conde Nast as we know it exit in a decade?
