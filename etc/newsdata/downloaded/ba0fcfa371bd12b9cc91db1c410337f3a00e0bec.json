It has a vast network of merchants including convenience stores and Taiwan\u2019s popular night markets favoured by tourists, which traditionally only accepted cash payments.\n\nLiquid Group will also work with E.SUN Bank to provide value-added services to help its partners deliver innovative services to their customers.\n\nGet the latest on startups\n\nand business news Terms & conditions Sign up\n\nFor instance, with the integrated payments and marketing infrastructure, merchants in Singapore and Taiwan can launch multiple marketing campaigns with participating payment apps, without the need for additional cashier training or verification during checkout. This will allow customers of Liquid Group\u2019s partners and of E.SUN Bank to access promotions and deals offered by merchants.\n\nTaiwan is the third market activated for interoperability trials across Liquid Group\u2019s cross-border QR payment network, after Hong Kong and Indonesia earlier this year.\n\nLiquid Group had partnered JETCO and CIMB Niaga to open up the corridors for QR payments across Singapore-Hong Kong and Singapore-Indonesia respectively.\n\nIn September, the startup announced it had expanded its QR payment acceptance partnerships to include financial institutions in seven new markets in Asia.\n\nThey are Taiwan, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia \u2013 on top of its existing markets of Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia.\n\nLiquid Group chief executive Jeremy Tan said last month that the startup plans to conduct interoperability trials in phases with six new markets \u2013 with Taiwan as the first \u2013 in Q4 this year, followed by the remaining markets next year.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to making the interoperability of the QR payment apps on our network multilateral, in support of growing intra-regional travel (in Asia),\u201d Mr Tan said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis would mean that travellers across the 10 markets in our network could make payment using their domestic apps in any of these markets,\u201d he added.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Garage - SINGAPORE startup Liquid Group has opened the QR (Quick Response) payments corridor between Singapore and Taiwan with its partnership with E.SUN Bank. .
