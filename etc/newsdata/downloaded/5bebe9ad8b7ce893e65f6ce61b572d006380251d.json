Republicans Push For a Consistent, Antiwar Trump Doctrine", "language": "en", "text": "Not all Republicans have given up on the less interventionist foreign policy Donald Trump campaigned on, even amid reports officials are developing plans to send 10,000 additional troops to the Middle East for a looming conflict with Iran.\n\nNuts to that, says Florida Representative Matt Gaetz. \u201cThe examples of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya\u2014just to name a few\u2014teach us that it is an illusion to think that just beyond the life of every dictator lies a peaceful democracy, rather than generations of anarchy, violence, terrorism, and chaos,\u201d the Republican Trump ally declared in what was billed as an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy speech.\n\nIn stark contrast with the radical vision laid out in George W. Bush\u2019s second inaugural address, Gaetz outlined a more conservative approach to the \u201cfreedom agenda.\u201d \u201cFreedom cannot be America\u2019s gift to the world, purchased with the blood of U.S. servicemembers alone,\u201d Gaetz said.\n\nA tough and moral foreign policy isn\u2019t one of preventive war. \u201cReal morality and real toughness is standing up to the pro-war special interests and globalist power brokers,\u201d he continued. \u201cReal morality is affirming forever that the blood of American troops is not for sale.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe setting was an event bringing together two veterans groups, one liberal (VoteVets) and the other conservative (Concerned Veterans for America), to challenge a foreign policy consensus that sends too many brave Americans to war with thin justification and often nonexistent congressional approval.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to end these endless wars, it\u2019s going to be through collaborations like yours,\u201d said Senator Tom Udall, the New Mexico Democrat who has collaborated with Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul on stopping a war with Iran as well as declaring victory and coming home from Afghanistan. \u201cA majority of troops and their families have no appetite for forever war.\u201d\n\nA recent poll commissioned by Concerned Veterans for America bears this out: just 6 percent of veterans and 13 percent of military families want the United States to be more engaged militarily around the world. Forty-eight percent of veterans said they wanted to see these military commitments reduced. Sixty percent support Trump on removing troops from Afghanistan.\n\nSpeakers didn\u2019t mince words about the potential for the Trump administration to get us into other wars, despite the president\u2019s contradictory statements. \u201cThese decisions are Congress\u2019s alone, not the president\u2019s,\u201d Udall said. Gaetz also warned \u201csaber-rattling persists,\u201d listing Venezuela, Iran, and Yemen.\n\nBut Gaetz, frequently seen on cable news defending the president, said this activist foreign policy was a departure from Trump\u2019s America First promises. \u201cThe Trump doctrine would prioritize securing the U.S. border with Mexico before we send Americans to die on the Saudi border with Yemen,\u201d the congressman maintained. \u201cStronger borders, energy dominance, and a thriving American economy do more for American security than ill-fated interventionist excursions.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new position for Gaetz. He voted in favor of the bipartisan antiwar Yemen resolution Trump vetoed. \u201cThe president\u2019s a dove. He has dovish tendencies,\u201d Gaetz insisted to VICE News during that debate. \u201cI think that if we get some time with him, we can make our argument about how the war in Yemen runs afoul of the Trump doctrine.\u201d The same is arguably true on Iran.\n\nJohn Bolton, the president\u2019s national security advisor, has other ideas. But if nothing else, Gaetz\u2019s speech showed that young, ambitious Republicans noticed when Trump went into the military-heavy state of South Carolina, said the right things about foreign policy, took on the likes of Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham, and won, even if the presidential follow-through was lacking.\n\n\u201cIn Congress, I represent the highest concentration of active duty military in America,\u201d Gaetz noted. \u201cThe Navy\u2019s Blue Angels are my constituents in Pensacola. The fiercest weapons delivered on time and on target by the United States Air Force are developed in my home county.\u201d He noted the impact of war on the fighting men of women, saying, \u201cThe fog of war is no fog to me. It\u2019s not hazy.\u201d\n\nFor the emerging Left-Right antiwar coalition to succeed, the Right has to do its part. This is true not just for the libertarian-leaning Republican lawmakers like Paul and Justin Amash, but the populist successors of Pat Buchanan who support Trump and his contention that great nations do not fight endless wars\u2014perhaps more than the president supports it himself.\n\nFor even if Trump\u2019s dissent is limited to mere rhetoric, it creates political space for other intervention skeptics in the GOP to act.\n\n\u201cThere are always places we could invade, people we could rescue, nations we could build. A clear-eyed look at the threats we face, proves that peace through strength also means strength through peace,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cThe Trump doctrine will make the world safer and more stable.\u201d\n\nIf not a doctrine of Trump\u2019s, then maybe some of his supporters.\n\nW.
