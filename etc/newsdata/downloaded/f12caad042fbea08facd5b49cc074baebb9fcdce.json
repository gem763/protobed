REUTERS/Darren Staples\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has already threatened to boycott the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England due to the exclusion of shooting which supplied 16 of India\u2019s 66 medals at last year\u2019s event on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast, including seven golds.\n\n\u201cThese Games have no standard. For me, these are a waste of time and money. We win 70 medals, 100 medals at the Commonwealth Games (CWG) while at the Olympics, we get stuck at two (medals),\u201d IOA President Batra told the Indian Express newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat means the level of competition isn\u2019t high at CWG. It\u2019s not a ranking tournament either. So why waste time? We should rather go to better competitions and prepare for the Olympics.\u201d\n\nIndian athletes managed just a silver and a bronze at the Rio Olympics in 2016 but finished third in the medals table at the Commonwealth Games last year.\n\nWithout shooting, however, India would slip to anywhere between fifth and eighth place in 2022, according to IOA estimates.\n\nIndia is relentlessly putting pressure on the Commonwealth Games Federation (CFG) to get shooting back on the roster in the 2022 CWG and the country\u2019s sports minister Kiren Rijiju has sought the intervention of the British government for its restoration.\n\nCGF chief Louise Martin is set to meet Batra in the Indian capital on Nov. 14 and the IOA will discuss the matter before that to reach a consensus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in favour of the boycott. In sports, you never use the word boycott. My fundamental principle is either we withdraw permanently or go and compete,\u201d Batra said.\n\n\u201cWe will have an internal discussion in IOA before the meeting (with CGF) on Nov. 14. I\u2019ll put up this suggestion in the IOA meeting and see if there is a consensus. We\u2019ll have political decisions as well.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games began in Hamilton, Canada in 1930.\n\n\u201cThe entire Middle East does not compete in CWG. The USA doesn\u2019t either,\u201d Batra said. \u201cAs a sports administrator, it is my duty to make sure India has a strong team for the 2024, 2028, 2032 Olympics. We won\u2019t achieve that by competing at the CWG.\u201d", "description": "India should pull out of the Commonwealth Games permanently because a lack of strong competition makes participation a waste of time and money, the country's Olympic chief Narinder Batra says.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433717771&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O0QP", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
