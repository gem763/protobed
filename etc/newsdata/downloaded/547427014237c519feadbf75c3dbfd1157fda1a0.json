Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Tuesday morning tore into Facebook following a report containing leaked audio from the company\u2019s top executive and founder.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a question about Warren\u2019s plan to break up big tech companies during an internal Q&A session and expressed concern about the prospect. According to the leaked audio, obtained by The Verge, the social-media scion said: \u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\u201d\n\nWarren responded on Twitter by saying: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nIn March, Warren introduced a proposal to break up major tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google.\n\nThe social media giant specifically has become the target of ire among many Democratic presidential candidates, for its misuse of data and allowance for a Russian disinformation campaign on the platform during the 2016 presidential election.", "description": "The Facebook CEO railed against the presidential candidate\u2019s plan to break up big tech companies.", "authors": ["Gideon Resnick", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2025,w_3600,x_0,y_126/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569941599/RTX74MIV_gno4ir", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
