But now the meaning of \u201csex\u201d has been contested all the way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn Harris Funeral Home, Inc. v. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the justices must decide if Title VII now bans discrimination on the basis of gender identification. If so, that will impact not just family businesses like Harris, but everything from women\u2019s shelters to single-sex athletic competitions. A girls\u2019 track meet that refused to allow a trans runner to compete could wind up in the same legal hell as one that tried to ban black runners.\n\nHarris Funeral Homes\u2019 long march through the legal system began in 2013 when funeral director Anthony Stephens came back from vacation as Aimee Stephens. Thomas Rost and his wife, co-owners of the family business, say the surprise wouldn\u2019t have been a problem \u2014 except that Stephens had agreed to follow a sex-specific dress code: suits for men, dresses and skirts for women, so that funeral directors offer a calm center for grieving families.\n\nAsked to comply with the dress code, Stephens refused. And after long reflection, the Rosts fired Stephens.\n\nEnter the Obama-era EEOC, which sued, insisting that \u201cgender identity\u201d is a facet of \u201csex\u201d under the law. After several rounds of appeals, the last ruling holds that the EEOC was correct.\n\nWill the Supreme Court agree? Most of the justices seemed unsure during oral argument, noting that Congress plainly didn\u2019t intend that meaning of \u201csex\u201d in 1964, and has never amended the law to adopt it. Yet some were open to the argument that the logic of anti-discrimination can and should now extend to categories no one even considered back in 1964.\n\nOne thing should be clear: Setting a reasonable standard here is more complex than most trans-rights advocates admit.\n\nAs the self-described radical feminists of the Women\u2019s Liberation Front put it in their friend-of-the-court brief: \u201cLegally redefining \u2018female\u2019 as anyone who claims to be female results in the erasure of female people as a class. If, as a matter of law, anyone can be a woman, then no one is a woman, and sex-based protections in the law have no meaning whatsoever . . . a ruling that Congress surely did not intend.\u201d\n\nSorting out such issues requires more than re\u00addefining \u201csex\u201d; it\u2019s a task the Supremes should leave to legislators.", "description": "In Harris Funeral Home, Inc. v. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the justices must decide if Title VII now bans discrimination on the basis of gender identification.", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "October"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/shutterstock_scotus.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
