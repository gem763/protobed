The inquiry was part of a far-reaching investigation into the program by the department, which under Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, has become increasingly aggressive in going after perceived anti-Israel bias in higher education.\n\nThat focus appears to reflect the views of an agency leadership that includes a civil rights chief, Kenneth L. Marcus, who has made a career of pro-Israel advocacy and has waged a yearslong campaign to delegitimize and defund Middle East studies programs that he has criticized as rife with anti-Israel bias.\n\nIn this case, the department homed in on what officials saw as a program that focused on the region\u2019s Muslim population at the expense of its religious minorities. In the North Carolina program\u2019s outreach to elementary and secondary school students, the department said, there was \u201ca considerable emphasis placed on the understanding the positive aspects of Islam, while there is an absolute absence of any similar focus on the positive aspects of Christianity, Judaism or any other religion or belief system in the Middle East.\u201d", "description": "The Education Department is investigating a Middle East studies program run by Duke and the University of North Carolina, citing, among other issues, how Judaism is discussed.", "authors": ["Erica L.
