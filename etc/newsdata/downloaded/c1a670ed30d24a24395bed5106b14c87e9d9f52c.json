Jerry Brown warned that the recent wildfires in California are a taste of what is to come if our leaders do not act on climate change.\n\n\u201cI said it was the new normal a few years ago,\u2019\u2019 Brown told Politico. \u201cThis is serious\u2026but this is only the beginning. This is only a taste of the horror and the terror that will occur in decades.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd it will occur in various spots: in America, in Africa, in Canada,\u2019\u2019 Brown added. \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable, other than the fact that it will get worse in present trajectory. Washington, under [President] Trump, is doing very little \u2014 and even the Congress has been unable to mobilize under Washington.\u2019\u2019\n\nBrown released his statement as several wildfires prompted current California Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency.\n\nNewsom, a Democrat, received a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to combat the brush fires spreading throughout Los Angeles.\n\nDemocrat Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti also signed an emergency declaration within Los Angeles to secure more resources to combat the fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. over the 405 freeway near the Getty Center museum.\n\nI\u2019m signing an emergency declaration immediately for the #GettyFire to help bring more resources to support our @LAFD in fighting this fire. pic.twitter.com/8CjOfJVBpl \u2014 Mayor Eric Garcetti (@MayorOfLA) October 28, 2019\n\nKABC reported that the wildfires burned more than 500 acres of land as of 7 a.m.\n\nLos Angeles Fire Department officials said that more than 10,000 residences and businesses were under mandatory evacuation orders. Even Los Angeles Lakers basketball star LeBron James tweeted Monday that he had to evacuate his home.\n\nMan these LA \ud83d\udd25 aren\u2019t no joke. Had to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far! \ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) October 28, 2019\n\nThe recent wildfires have also led California\u2019s largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), to shut off power to two million customers for safety reasons.", "description": "Former Gov.
