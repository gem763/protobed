'She should not be paid off for doing a deadly job. I am very angry.\n\n'Dany Cotton should be made to pay the consequences of the fire brigade being so unprepared and for their inflexibility and failure to respond to events on the ground.'\n\nNabil Choucair, who lost six family members in the blaze, said Miss Cotton's pension pot was 'like winning the lottery'.\n\nHe said: 'She doesn't deserve it. Her not doing her job, or what she should have done, resulted in a lot of people dying. And she deserves an early retirement payout?\n\n'I don't think so. I don't think she's setting a good example. She's just showing how if something goes wrong, this is how you get out of it \u2013 by retiring early. Whoever is responsible needs to be held accountable \u2013 not rewarded.'\n\nMiss Cotton, who became the fire brigade's first female commissioner in 2017, has previously compared the sight of flames ripping through the tower block to a 'disaster movie'.\n\nShe said the fire was 'the most difficult thing' she had dealt with in her career, saying that she has suffered memory loss and received counselling.\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire in North Kensington, West London, in June 2017 left 72 people dead\n\nIn her testimony, she also claimed no training could have prepared the fire crews, saying: 'I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard.'\n\nSir Martin's report describes the lack of training at the fire services as an 'institutional' failure.\n\nHe concludes: 'Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped, the commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB, even with hindsight, serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the fire.'\n\nHe also says Miss Cotton's evidence 'betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew (even if she personally did not) that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high-rise building with a cladding system'.\n\nGrenfell Tower in West London burns hours after the blaze swept through it in June 2017\n\nMiss Cotton joined the brigade aged 18 as one of 30 female London firefighters.\n\nThe 935-page report into events on the night was published today. Sir Martin makes 46 recommendations following a two-year investigation.\n\nHe says the 'principal reason' why the flames shot up the 24-storey high rise was the combustible aluminium cladding used in the refurbishment.\n\nThe report also concludes the fire started as the result of an 'electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer' in a fourth floor flat.\n\nPart two of the inquiry examining the circumstances and causes of the disaster begins in January.", "description": "Dany Cotton, who plans to retire next April aged 50 on a pension worth up to \u00a32million, said she was 'disappointed' by chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick's report into the blaze in West London in 2017.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20333870-0-image-a-36_1572431550786.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
