What basis is there for thinking that a deal in anything like the form the EU would accept would be supported in the Commons?

And it is embedded in how the Benn Act operates.\n\nPretty much the only thing MPs consistently agree on is that they will not contemplate a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve passed two pieces of legislation compelling the prime minister to ask for an extension, the second being the Benn Act. But the problem is, if they fall into line with the prime minister\u2019s plan, they open the door to no deal.\n\nThe Benn Act does only one thing. It imposes a mandatory obligation on the part of the prime minister to ask for an extension if no withdrawal agreement has been approved by parliament by the end of 19 October.\n\nUnder the plan set out above, they would approve the withdrawal agreement on 19 October and, as if by magic, that obligation would disappear. This piece explains how and why.\n\nThe prime minister could then deliver no deal and placate his Spartans, and his Party membership, and destroy the Brexit Party.\n\nIndeed, even if MPs were to wait until later to approve the withdrawal agreement, they would still throw open the door to no deal. The Benn Act allows the prime minister to withdraw his request for an extension even if the date upon which MPs pass a withdrawal agreement is after 19 October. That\u2019s what section 1(5) of the Benn Act says.\n\nThe only way in which MPs can ensure that the prime minister \u2013 who is, let us remember, a man barely on nodding terms with the truth \u2013 doesn\u2019t deliver no deal is to wait for an extension to be agreed with the EU before they vote on the withdrawal agreement.\n\nAnd I know, from conversations with several of the key MPs, that they are entirely wise to this.\n\nIf Boris Johnson really wants to pass the withdrawal agreement on 19 October he will need to ask for an extension now. An extension, remember, that he said he would rather \"die in a ditch\" than seek.\n\nOr he can wave goodbye to an October deal.", "description": "There\u2019s an emerging consensus \u2013 to be found in the newly reopened corridors of Westminster, the brokerage notes of the City, and the chat of commentators \u2013 that Boris Johnson will bring a withdrawal agreement back from \u201cBrussels\u201d and we will leave with a deal on 31 October 2019.", "authors": ["Jolyon Maugham"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/14/Boris-Johnson-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
