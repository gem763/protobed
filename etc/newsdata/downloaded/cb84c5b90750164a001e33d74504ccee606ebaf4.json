Parliament had different ideas, insisting on legal guarantees that Britain agree to a departure deal before exiting the European Union. It was the first of a string of legislative defeats for Johnson, who has been forced to go more slowly on Brexit than he had wanted.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAmbassadors from the 27 remaining E.U. members agreed Monday to postpone the departure date until the end of January, although Britain could still leave earlier if Parliament ratifies the separation deal ahead of time. In Europe\u2019s jargon-loving precincts, that means Britain has received a \u201cflextension.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK\u2019s request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020,\u201d European Council President Donald Tusk said Monday on Twitter. Ambassadors agreed to the deal without calling in national leaders for an in-person meeting, a sign that the decision ultimately was not especially controversial.\n\nLeaders are tired of debating Brexit at a moment when many European economies are flagging, extreme parties are still nipping at their heels and many citizens just want to move on. But they also fear igniting an economic blaze by kicking Britain out of the bloc before it is ready.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow Johnson plans to push for a general election in early December. Parliament is scheduled to debate election plans later Monday.\n\nJohnson will ask lawmakers \u2014 for the third time \u2014 to back his calls for a general election. Under 2011 legislation, Johnson needs the backing of two-thirds of the House of Commons to call an early election, meaning he needs opposition support. Johnson wants a Dec. 12 election, but without the Labour Party backing him, he appears likely to fail in this attempt.\n\nBut there may be another route. Johnson\u2019s government could back a plan by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, which have suggested a Dec. 9 election. They could attempt to pass a one-line piece of legislation, which would need only a simple majority. The legislation, which would call for an election on that date and could be amended, could be passed as early as Tuesday. If greenlighted, it would mark the first time that Britain has held a general election in December since the 1920s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a series of tweets, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, explained why she was supporting an early general election. Doing nothing, she said, would allow Johnson to get his \u201cbad deal through.\u201d Or it could allow Johnson to run out the clock until the end of January, when a divorce from the E.U. without a deal, known as the no-deal Brexit, \u201cbecomes a real risk all over again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFor all his bluster, Johnson would much prefer to fight an election with Brexit already \u2018delivered,\u2019\u201d Sturgeon tweeted. \u201cAn election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October \u2018do or die\u2019 promise and also defend his bad deal.\u201d\n\nSome European leaders view Britain\u2019s continued membership in the bloc with significant wariness. Monday\u2019s delay was granted on the condition that British representatives in the E.U. agree not to obstruct the body\u2019s decision-making while they linger inside the club, as Johnson has at times threatened to do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe E.U. leaders also want Johnson to name a European commissioner, a kind of senior E.U. bureaucrat, because each member country is required to do so under E.U. treaties.\n\nNaming someone would be another politically symbolic defeat for Johnson. Not naming a commissioner would violate the E.U. treaties, potentially opening the bloc\u2019s decisions to legal challenges and upsetting the Europeans.\n\nMonday\u2019s postponement still needs a final sign-off, because Johnson has to agree to it. Assuming everything goes as expected, it will be legally binding on Tuesday or Wednesday, just ahead of the current departure date on Thursday.\n\nAdam reported from London.
