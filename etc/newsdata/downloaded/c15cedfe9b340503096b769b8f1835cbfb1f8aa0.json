When you put the disappointment behind you, you think about the chance to play the All Blacks and that gets you excited. Hopefully as coaches we\u2019ve put the disappointment of the last 48 hours behind us and can start getting excited for the next 24.\n\nNew Zealand were humbled by England in the final four (Picture: PA Wire)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the same for the group of players. We want to go out, perform well, and be positive about the way we play. I think the All Blacks will play the same way.\n\n\u2018Both teams are quite similar in terms of the synergy we are trying to achieve with the selection. Both of us will want to be positive in the way we want to play.\u2019\n\nWales might not be able to lift the World Cup, but they can make some history still, by beating the All Blacks for the first time in well over half a century.\n\n\u2018It has been a long time, 66 years not to beat a side,\u2019 continued Gatland. \u2018We have had success against every other nation; the All Blacks have been that elusive team we have not been able to conquer.\u2019\n\nNew Zealand coach Steve Hansen is taking charge of his final game with the All Blacks, and insists that his side are absolutely motivated to succeed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s been a lot of external talk around this being the game that no one wants to play,\u2019 said the two-time World Cup winning coach. \u2018However, from our point of view, we can\u2019t wait to play it. Everyone in the squad \u2013 players and management \u2013 are motivated by the opportunity to show that our last performance wasn\u2019t at the high standard that we know we can play at.\n\n\u2018This is a Test match against an opposition that will also be keen to make a statement. Therefore, we will need to turn up with real attitude, intent and work ethic, and then execute our skillsets to the highest level possible. The game will be physical and fast as both teams will look to play to their strengths.\u2019\n\nThe Bronze Final is played at the Tokyo Stadium at 9am UK time on Friday.\n\nMORE: England sweating over Kyle Sinckler\u2019s fitness ahead of Rugby World Cup final with South Africa\n\nMORE: England\u2019s Billy Vunipola sends bullish message to South Africa ahead of the Rugby World Cup final", "description": "Wales coach Warren Gatland says both his team and New Zealand might have preferred a drinking game to the World Cup third-place play-off ahead of them on Friday.
