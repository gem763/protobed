That\u2019s the sobering lesson from the government-run experiment with renewable fuels. Promoted as a cleaner alternative to gasoline, federal fuel mandates have their own environmental impacts. Though America\u2019s farmers have reaped the benefits of selling food crops for fuel production, it is time to mix U.S. energy policy with a strong dose of reason.\n\nPresident Trump recently announced a new federal commitment to the so-called Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires the addition of billions of gallons of crop-derived ethanol into the nation\u2019s supply of gasoline and diesel fuel. \u201cThe Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol,\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nAt stake are waivers the Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has granted in the past to certain fuel refineries, exempting them from a requirement to purchase more than 2 billion gallons of mostly corn and soybean ethanol from the annual nationwide mandate of 15 billion gallons. The president\u2019s decision recommits the oil industry to purchasing the full amount, thus ensuring farm income. Whether the mandate kicks in for 2020 or later is still under review.\n\nFarm belt lawmakers, whose jobs depend on bringing home the bacon, applauded the announcement. \u201cPresident Trump has made clear that he is an ally of corn and soybean farmers as well as ethanol and biodiesel producers,\u201d said Sen. Charles Grassley, Iowa Republican. \u201cThis announcement is great news for Iowa, the Midwest and the entire country.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s bad news, though, for the U.S. oil industry, which is required to add the ocean of grain alcohol to their petroleum products. \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the administration\u2019s decision to, once again, play politics with our fuel system by increasing an already onerous biofuel mandate, placing greater strain on the U.S. manufacturers he promised to protect and threatening higher costs for consumers,\u201d read a statement from the American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers.\n\nThe RFS was instituted by Congress in 2005 as a means of supplementing the nation\u2019s fossil-fuel supply with homegrown energy when the Iraq War triggered fears of a global oil supply disruption. As a result, most gas sold in the United States contains 10 percent ethanol, called E10. The rule trims petroleum consumption but reduces vehicle gas mileage. The president\u2019s ethanol push could also boost the use of E15. The EPA warns that its 15 percent ethanol concentration can harm engines of older cars and trucks, and the agency bans its use in heavy-duty vehicles such as school buses and delivery trucks.\n\nThe RFS was also expected to result in cleaner air due to diminished tailpipe emissions. The Department of Energy\u2019s Alternative Fuels Data Center credits corn ethanol with 34 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline. However, a recent white paper by the libertarian Cato Institute disagrees, citing a 2018 American Journal of Agricultural Economics analysis of multiple emissions studies that concluded ethanol offers a miniscule 0.23 percent reduction in greenhouses gases.\n\nThe ethanol mandate has impacted the nation\u2019s water supply as well, according to Cato. Between 2008 and 2012, an additional 4.2 million acres of U.S. cropland was planted in mostly marginal areas. Corn processed into E85 fuel (85 percent ethanol, 15 percent gasoline) requires a quart of water per mile traveled \u2014 twice as much water to produce than conventional gas. Corn requiring irrigation sucks up 28 gallons per mile traveled. Lawmakers high on ethanol may have overlooked the fact that as corn alcohol reservoirs go up, water tables go down.\n\nNeither have they likely foreseen the United States becoming the world\u2019s largest producer of crude oil. With the nation currently pumping 12.4 million barrels a day, the mandate for ethanol serves a diminishing purpose, aside from providing big-business farmers with a ready market for their crops.\n\nIt is understandable that Mr. Trump wants to lend a hand to American farmers hurt by the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. His plan to boost ethanol as well as the Renewable Fuel Standard for 2020, due by Nov. 30, should acknowledge that the benefits of crop-based biofuels are not cut and dried.\n\nThe current ethanol use makes balancing the nation\u2019s clean air and water needs trickier, and the bounty of petroleum products make reliance on alternative sources of energy less vital.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
