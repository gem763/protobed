Harris has not run a good campaign\n\nThis theory takes the Harris surge in July more seriously \u2014 it was real and represented a real opportunity for the California senator. Her campaign simply squandered it.\n\nHarris\u2019s campaign launch speech was widely praised, and she was strong in the first debate. But she has not had a strategy of keeping herself in the news, the way Warren\u2019s policy rollouts and liberal stances did earlier in the year. And Harris hasn\u2019t built a clear brand and rationale for her candidacy along the lines of Buttigieg\u2019s (\u201cI\u2019m young\u201d), Biden\u2019s (\u201cI can beat Trump\u201d), or Sanders and Warren (\u201cI will take on the wealthy\u201d).\n\nI think this lack of clarity about the rationale for her candidacy \u2014 beyond appealing to a broad coalition of Democrats \u2014 has led to some of Harris\u2019s stumbles. Her months-long waffling on Medicare for All likely stemmed from a desire to appease both the party\u2019s left-wing (which favors MFA) and the center-left wing (which opposes MFA). But this field may be too big for anyone to straddle the left and center-left \u2014 and perhaps health care is an issue where you can\u2019t equivocate. Similarly, while Harris attacked Biden\u2019s past opposition to aggressive school integration plans, she was hesitant to offer much of a proposal of her own on that issue. It seemed like Harris wanted to use that issue to nod at her racial liberalism but wasn\u2019t prepared to commit to a big school integration plan, which might be controversial.", "description": "", "authors": ["Perry Bacon", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features What-Happened-To-The-Kamala-Harris-Campaign"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
