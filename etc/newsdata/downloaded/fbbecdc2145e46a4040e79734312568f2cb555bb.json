The dynamic duo dish on what they like and don\u2019t like.\n\n1. Your favourite artists right now?\n\nBanele: Sjava and Nasty C are top of my list of male artists and Zonke is my favourite female artist. She\u2019s very talented.\n\nBandile: Nasty C and my homey and best friend, Nadia Nakai.\n\n2. How do you deal with groupies?\n\nBanele: I\u2019m used to attention because I\u2019m a twin, but it\u2019s become worse since I became a celebrity, so I take it easy and don\u2019t let it get to my head.\n\nBandile: I don\u2019t entertain them much. I take photos, smile and make conversation. My rule is: you can\u2019t be in bed with your fans.\n\nREAD MORE: This is why fans are convinced Bonang is dating this local DJ\n\n3. How do you handle criticism on social media?\n\nBanele: I just ignore it. No one questions organisations such as banks when they change their logos for example, so why question me as a brand?\n\nBandile: I look at it and just block that negativity.\n\n4. What\u2019s the one thing you don\u2019t mind splurging on?\n\nBanele: Clothes.\n\nBandile: Definitely clothes! I can\u2019t stop.", "description": "They\u2019re like two peas in a pod.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8265/b9e0d6f91f0b4bd6a481fac8298a8810.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
