It comes after a frail performance for world stocks in recent weeks, with investors gripped by political uncertainty in the U.S. and Hong Kong, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Brexit tensions and a flurry of weaker-than-anticipated economic data.\n\nU.S. nonfarm payrolls data has been forecast to show the U.S. economy added 145,000 new jobs in September, Reuters reported, more than an increase of 130,000 in the previous month.\n\nMarket participants have priced in an almost 90% chance that the U.S. central bank will cut interest rates by 25 basis points in October, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.\n\nThe Fed has already cut interest rates twice this year, as policymakers try to limit the fallout caused by the ongoing U.S.-China trade war.\n\nBack in Europe, European Council President Donald Tusk has said he is \"open but not convinced\" by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's proposals for a Brexit deal.\n\nOn Thursday, Johnson said he felt he had made a \"genuine attempt to bridge the chasm\" with EU lawmakers. The U.K. is scheduled to leave the bloc at the end of the month, with time running out for both sides to reach a deal.\n\nIn corporate news, BP announced that CEO Bob Dudley will step down as of March next year to be replaced by current upstream chief executive Bernard Looney. The energy giant's shares were up 0.7% in early trade.\n\nOn the data front, German construction Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for September will be released shortly after the opening bell.\n\nIn terms of individual stocks, Norway's Tomra Systems was the biggest early gainer, adding 4.9%, while Britain's Clydesdale Bank slipped 1.9% to the bottom of the Stoxx 600.", "description": "European stocks traded higher Friday morning, as investors brace for a key U.S. jobs report", "authors": ["Elliot Smith Sam Meredith", "Elliot Smith", "Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102544581-trader2.jpg?v=1427708656", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
