It needs new funds by next month at the latest. The US flexible offices group, whose tech veneer has worn thin, has forfeited a $US6 billion ($8.9 billion) credit line by failing to float.\n\nIts survival depends on banks and SoftBank. In exchange, the Japanese tech investor could take control. For all those involved but one, co-founder Adam Neumann, there seems little hope left of a happy ending.\n\nSoftBank had lined up $US1.5 billion for WeWork next April. That would now be too late. Boss Masayoshi Son has to contemplate a multibillion-dollar financing this year for his most visible flop. The alternative would be writing down the value of the WeWork stake.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s own share price has dropped 30 per cent in the past six months, even as it struggles to raise a second Vision Fund.\n\nInvestment banks, too, are riding for a fall. Profit expectations for Goldman Sachs have been cut, in part reflecting a likely loss on WeWork shares. Jefferies has booked a $US146 million writedown. JPMorgan, leading current financing talks, has the tough job of getting peers on board. It is one of several banks that have exposure from $US380 million in loans extended to Mr Neumann secured by his stock.\n\nLandlords have just as much on the line. WeWork\u2019s $US47 billion long-term lease liabilities make it the largest private tenant in several cities including New York City, Chicago and London. A cash crunch would cause disruption in global real estate.", "description": "For all those involved but one, co-founder Adam Neumann, there seems little hope left of a happy ending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1283%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7f9baa8a04cccffe170b1e9b0a4faf0aa8eed325", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
