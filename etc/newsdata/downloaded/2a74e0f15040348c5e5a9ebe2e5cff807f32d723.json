Rand Paul\u2019s chief strategist, in response to the campaign's promotion of the story, and tagged a former top McConnell aide.\n\nWhere are my \u201cCorrupt for Kentucky\u201d shirts @HolmesJosh How long does this need to take. \u2014 Doug Stafford (@dougstafford) October 8, 2019\n\nA spokesman for Chao had no comment on the tweets, but McConnell\u2019s campaign was unapologetic.\n\nMcConnell campaign manager Kevin Golden told POLITICO that McConnell\u2019s status as Senate majority leader \u201cgives Kentucky a great advantage over wealthier states like New York or California\u201d and that his \u201ctremendous influence has helped in a number of other ways.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, said McConnell\u2019s seizing on his wife\u2019s position to boost his electoral chances was unseemly and unethical.\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell\u2019s unethical manipulation of his position and family ties to help himself and his political allies isn\u2019t a selling point for Kentuckians,\u201d said Stewart Boss, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cWhen ethics experts say McConnell\u2019s actions feel more like corruption to the average American, it\u2019s not hard to see why McConnell is the most unpopular senator in the country and toxic with voters across Kentucky.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel for the watchdog group Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and former White House counsel to the previous two Democratic presidents, said the tweets raise new ethical questions about Chao\u2019s dealings with her husband\u2019s constituents.\n\n\"The McConnell campaign's use of an article, which draws critical attention to Chao's use of her public office to disproportionately benefit her husband's constituents, raises new Hatch Act issues about whether she has authorized him to use her official position for partisan political activity,\" Canter said.\n\nPOLITICO reported on Monday that 25 percent of Chao\u2019s meetings with local officials over her first 14 months in office were with Kentuckians, while no other state had more than 6 percent. At the same time, she repeatedly snubbed officials from large states with major projects in the works who were seeking meetings.\n\nThe day POLITICO\u2019s article appeared, McConnell\u2019s campaign tweeted the article out, \u201cMitch McConnell is a Kentucky Asset\u201d with a link to the article. (In July, the Washington Post printed a story with the title, \u201cMitch McConnell is a Russian asset.\u201d)\n\nThe next day, the McConnell campaign tweeted a photo of the article in POLITICO\u2019s print edition, along with a screenshot of a graphic from the article visualizing the large number of meetings Chao held with people from Kentucky in comparison with every other state.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bb/d1/28cc73a34a5b8a31e12a03e15bbf/20191008-mcconnell-chao-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
