They haven\u2019t helped us fighting for our land,\" Trump told his audience Saturday night. \u201cLet them have their borders, but I don\u2019t think our soldiers should be there for the next 15 years guarding a border between Turkey and Syria when we can\u2019t guard our own borders.\"\n\n\u201cI said, 'We just spent billions in Iraq and it was the single worst mistake we\u2019ve ever made,'\u201d Trump said, explaining his rationale for pulling U.S. forces out of the area. \u201cWe defeated ISIS, we did our job, now we have to go home ...
