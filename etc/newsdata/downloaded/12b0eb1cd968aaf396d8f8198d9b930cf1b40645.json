It considers the proposed project to be too focused on the expansion of commercial space.\n\n\u201cThe project, which does not meet environmental requirements, must evolve significantly to adapt to the expectations of travellers and residents,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe city wishes further negotiations and will propose alternatives as early as next week\u201d to the SNCF and regional politicians, for \u201ca solution that improves the comfort of travellers and the quality of life of residents.\u201d\n\nThe project has the backing of officials in the national and regional governments, however.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Europe\u2019s busiest train station, Paris\u2019 bustling Gare du Nord, may get a much-needed facelift after a government tribunal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/14/de3b33_gare-du-nord-is-europe-busiest-train-station-gare-du-nord-europe-busiest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
