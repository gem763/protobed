Goins, as The Knoxville News Sentinel reported, wrote about how she and a group of teachers got together and paid for a hungry student.\n\nJLo posted a video of the donation being made on Wednesday, and the kids were touched by the gifts. \"We were so touched. We were so moved. ... Oh my God. We were crying,\" JLo said in the video. \"You know my mom was a teacher, and it was such a moving story to us that we wanted to help.\"\n\nJENNIFER LOPEZ, SHAKIRA CONFIRMED AS SUPER BOWL HALFTIME SHOW PERFORMERS\n\nThe power couple donated the food from a company they own in part, Tiller & Hatch.\n\n\"This is why being a business owner, and having actual ownership in companies (not licensing), is so important to me and Alex, especially as Latinos. It's about showing our community, this is what life can be. You can take charge and take ownership. It allows us to have a say in creating things that make people's lives better and have partners that share our passion for giving back. Because giving back and being there for others is really what matters most \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f,\" Lopez said on Instagram. \"We are happy to be in business with partners who also believe no child should EVER have to go to sleep hungry. Everyone should have access to delicious, nutritious food. This was my favorite moment of the month and it\u2019s one of the best things we\u2019ve been able to do. @tillerandhatch #tillerandhatch\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "JLo and A-Rod are continuing to be inspirations in America, this time by donating a year\u2019s worth of food to an East Tennessee elementary school, according to a report.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
