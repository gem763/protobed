He made the compelling case for an end to the push for a borderless world.\n\nAt the 74th United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, Trump explained how nationalism is good for everyone. By focusing on the people within their own countries, leaders around the globe can bring prosperity worldwide while preserving what is cherished about each nation.\n\n\u201cThe future does not belong to globalists \u2013 the future belongs to patriots,\u201d Trump explained. \u201cThe future belongs to sovereign and independent nations who protect their citizens, respect their neighbors, and honor the differences that make each country special and unique.\u201d\n\nHe is the first American President to call out the pernicious influence of globalism: \u201cGlobalism exerted a religious pull over past leaders, causing them to ignore their own national interests.\u201d That harmful pull by the \u201creligion\u201d of globalism has misguided past Democratic and Republican presidents alike, he could have added.\n\nOne of the harms of globalism, Trump explained, has been the support for perpetual or endless wars. Instead, he observed, \u201cThe United States has never believed in permanent enemies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of America\u2019s closest friends today were once our gravest foes.\u201d Included in the list of the \u201cgravest foes\u201d would be England, Germany and Japan, all of which are now among our closest friends.\n\nTrump lambasted mass migration, by which illegal immigrants flood a peaceful nation and overrun it with crime, demands for entitlements, and hardships. \u201cMass illegal migration is unfair, unsafe, and unsustainable for everyone involved,\u201d Trump pointed out.\n\n\u201cThe sending countries and the depleted countries \u2013 and they\u2019ve become depleted very fast \u2013 their youth is not taken care of and human capital goes to waste,\u201d he added. In the United States, \u201cwe have taken very unprecedented action to stop the flow of illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nTrump sent a strong message against migration as prior presidents of both parties should have stood for, but none did. \u201cTo anyone considering crossing our border illegally, please hear these words: Do not pay the smugglers.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s political foes already mischaracterize his speech as somehow being \u201caggressive\u201d or \u201cred meat\u201d for Trump\u2019s base, as Politico.com put it. But there was nothing aggressive or politicized about Trump\u2019s remarks, which reflect his long-held views and what he was elected to do.\n\nThe Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, profusely praised Trump at a massive rally of 50,000 people in a football stadium in Houston on Sunday. Modi is one of many world leaders who support Trump.\n\nTrump\u2019s rejection of globalism included a warning to China about how it handles unrest in Hong Kong. \u201cHow China chooses to handle the situation will say a great deal about its role in the world in the future.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Trump mentioned the despair in Venezuela as an illustration \u201cthat socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation. Socialism and Communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class.\u201d\n\nThe largest neighbor of Venezuela is Brazil, which is led by another outspoken supporter of Trump. Jair Bolsonaro, who addressed the UN before Trump, has previously praised Trump\u2019s opposition to illegal immigration and wants \u201cto have a great Brazil just like Trump wants to have a great America.\u201d\n\nTrump found time during his speech to call out the media and liberal universities. \u201cMedia and academic institutions push flat-out assaults on our histories, traditions and values,\u201d Trump rightly observed.\n\nThe Deep State, too, received recognition by Trump, and not in a complimentary way. \u201cA faceless bureaucracy operates in secret and weakens democratic rule,\u201d he declared.\n\nTrump again exceeded expectations by being the finest advocate for the unborn to ever reside in the White House. He told the UN that \u201cAmericans will also never tire of defending innocent life,\u201d and criticized how \u201cmany United Nations projects have attempted to assert a global right to taxpayer-funded abortion on demand \u2013 right up until the moment of delivery.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump says and does what he promised as a candidate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has meanwhile caved into the far left of the Democratic Party. The same day Trump was speaking to world leaders at the UN, Pelosi opened an impeachment investigation to improperly try to weaken his authority.\n\nThe timing of Pelosi\u2019s unpatriotic act could not have been more inappropriate. She chose the same day as Trump\u2019s speech to the UN to try to undermine him with the politically motivated impeachment inquiry.\n\nGlobalism is a stepchild of communism, and neither should be the future. All nations should take Trump\u2019s words to heart about making their own countries great again, and some already are.\n\nJohn and Andy Schlafly are sons of Phyllis Schlafly (1924-2016) and lead the continuing Phyllis Schlafly Eagles organizations with writing and policy work.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s third speech to the United Nations in as .09/25/2019 0:32:13AM EST.", "authors": ["John", "Andy Schlafly", "Katie Pavlich", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/266/15165090-a00f-474a-aff0-19a1f0fa36d0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
