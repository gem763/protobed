They were taken to a local clinic, where they were treated for shock and mild hypothermia.\n\n\"Where they had washed onto the rocks, the NSRI and the joint emergency services searching for them were approximately half-an-hour behind them, indicating that we would have caught up with them in a relatively short space of time according to our planned and plotted search and rescue grid,\" Lambinon said.\n\nThe NSRI commend all parties who contributed to the safe return of the pair to their families who \"were emotional but delighted with the news of them being found safe\".\n\nMeanwhile, the NSRI also evacuated four injured men aboard a bulk carrier approaching Port Elizabeth on Wednesday.\n\nThe crew of four sustained injuries after a wave broke over the vessel at sea off-shore of the vicinity of Port Edward on Tuesday, the NSRI said in a statement.\n\n\"Suffering serious injuries, efforts to get medical and rescue teams onto the ship commenced following a request for emergency medical assistance from the ship.\n\n\"One man suffered critical injuries with fractures to the jaw, hip, clavicle and a suspended neck fracture, one man suffered a fractured femur and hip, one man suffered a fractured Tibia and one man sustained bruising to the head,\" said Lambinon.\n\nDue to unfavourable weather conditions, the patients were treated on the ship and arrangements were made for the ship to enter the port.\n\nAfter the ship docked in Port Elizabeth, the patients were stabilised.\n\n\"NSRI resucue crew and additional medical teams assisted in ongoing medical care and transferring the injured patients on stretchers to ambulances and they have been transported to hospitals for further treatment \u2013 in serious but stable conditions,\" Lambinon concluded.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
