Trade tensions eased in October, however, after the U.S. and China resumed negotiations.\n\nSome 27% of respondents mentioned the negative effect of tariffs without being prompted, down from 36% in September.\n\nThe potential move by Democrats to impeach President Trump had little affect on confidence. Only 2% of survey respondents mentioned impeachment.\n\nStill, optimism is not as high as it was in 2018, when the Trump tax cuts, higher federal spending and roaring job creation gave the U.S. economy a big boost.\n\nBig picture: The economy has slowed since the spring largely because of the trade war with China, but the strongest labor market in decades is shielding the U.S. from further harm. Most Americans who want a job can find one and they\u2019re spending enough to keep alive a record 10-year-plus economic expansion.\n\n\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.66% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.44% were slightly higher in Friday trades.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +2.45% was little changed at 1.77%. The yield has been cut nearly in half over the past year.", "description": "Americans are still fairly optimistic about their own job situations and financial health, but they\u2019re more worried about the economy than they were last...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU026_consu8_ZG_20191025095402.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
