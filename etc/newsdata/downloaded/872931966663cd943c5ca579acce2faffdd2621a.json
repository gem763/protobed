A rather mild \"miss\", in the parlance. There was more: the previous month's number had been downgraded quite sharply as well.\n\nThe economy is still adding jobs, sure, but markets want it to move ahead of the curve.\n\nAnd it wasn't just the jobs figures. The night before, a key US manufacturing activity measure dropped into contractionary territory and to its lowest level in a decade. This is notable because the transmission mechanism from the global manufacturing malaise to Walmart foot traffic is when American firms stop hiring and eventually retrenching workers. That's when the true recession starts.\n\nStill, it's all rather early days. And it's not the first time a bad American labour market number has caused mayhem.\n\nIn early 2018, an above-consensus US wage growth figure fanned fears that inflation was about to finally take hold in the world's largest economy and threaten close to a decade of monetary policy support. It was the catalyst for a vertiginous market correction, but it wasn't the end of days.\n\nIn fact \u2013 that January wages number was ultimately shown to be misleading. That's right: the economic data that sent investors into a frenzy was based on \"improper underlying data\", as an economist told me a couple of months later.\n\nI bring this up just to show, again, how sensitive this market is generally, and how sensitive it is to US labour numbers in particular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack then it was fear that the global economy was running too hot. Now it's the opposite: that the global manufacturing recession, exacerbated by Trump's trade war with China, will spill over to the US services sector.\n\nThe timing of this latest tremor is eery. It was almost exactly this time last year that world markets began a mini-meltdown that was ultimately only arrested by promises of further support from central banks.\n\nEverybody expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates further, and the ECB has already moved, somewhat controversially, to restart quantitative easing. The Reserve Bank has dropped rates three times this year, and the zero lower bound is in sight.\n\nHaving already expended so much monetary ammunition, and with politics in such a volatile state, let's hope Friday night's jobs number is just a blip.", "description": "The storm that swept through global markets this week shows just how much this bull market depends on the health of the American consumer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2764%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_466%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9188e091c4617bb63bac432d4333013953c2a8c7", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
