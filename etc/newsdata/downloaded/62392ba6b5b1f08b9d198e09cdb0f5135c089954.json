The Kaiser Family Foundation, using census data, has estimated that 47 percent of the country\u2019s roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants are uninsured, compared with one-fourth of legally present immigrants and about one-tenth of American citizens. Similarly, the Urban Institute places the number of uninsured undocumented immigrants at nearly 4.9 million, or about one-sixth of the total population of uninsured people in America.\n\nThe case for expanding their health-care access rests on financial, public-health, and moral arguments. Supporters contend that it\u2019s cheaper to provide access to medical care up front, rather than deal with health crises in emergency rooms; that allowing the undocumented to go untreated increases health risks for legal residents who come in contact with them; and that it is unjust to let people face health threats without care, regardless of their status. As Biden put it in a recent interview with CNN, \u201cHow do you say, \u2018You\u2019re undocumented. I\u2019m going to let you die, man\u2019? What are you going to do?\u201d The counterargument, meanwhile, is that it\u2019s unfair to ask taxpayers to subsidize their care, and that covering the undocumented will act as a \u201cmagnet\u201d to incentivize more immigration.\n\nEmergency rooms must provide aid to all who need it. But polls have consistently found that most Americans resist offering public benefits to the undocumented beyond that. In a recent CNN survey, Americans by a solid 3\u20132 margin said that \u201chealth insurance provided by the government\u201d should not be available to immigrants here illegally. The idea faced resistance across a wide array of constituencies, including several that Democrats rely on: Just over half of college-educated white voters, half of young adults ages 18 to 34, and more than two-fifths of nonwhites said they opposed providing coverage for the undocumented. At the same time, three-fifths of voters who identified as Democrats or lean Democratic said they support the idea.\n\nThis mixed result leaves the 2020 candidates balancing competing political and policy considerations as they confront the question. In the process, they have reopened a debate that extends back to the consideration of the ACA during former President Barack Obama\u2019s first year in office.\n\nThe original version of the ACA, passed by the Democratic-controlled House in November 2009, allowed undocumented immigrants to purchase insurance on the law\u2019s exchanges with their own money. But it denied them eligibility for the subsidies the law established to help the uninsured afford such coverage, and it maintained their exclusion from Medicaid, which the ACA expanded to cover more of the working poor.", "description": "Several 2020 candidates are proffering moral and policy arguments for providing coverage, but the politics of the move are another matter.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/07/AP_17265758275986/facebook.jpg?1562859091", "published_at": "2019-07-20"}
