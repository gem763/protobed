I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\u201d Ms. Huffman had pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud in helping her daughter gain admission to college and was being sentenced for her crime.\n\nHow refreshing. How soul-restoring -- not only for Ms. Huffman, no doubt, but in a sense for our nation. Here was a woman, a wealthy celebrity, who was admitting to having paid $15,000 to a college admissions scammer, William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, to have an accomplice correct Ms. Huffman\u2019s daughter\u2019s SAT scores for her, with the goal of gaining admission to a college, and she was expressing total remorse.\n\nWas her heartfelt confession motivated entirely by the hope for a lesser sentence from the judge? She is an actress, after all. I don\u2019t think so. The anecdote Ms. Huffman related following her acknowledgement of guilt suggests that she reached deep into her soul with her admission and acceptance of responsibility. In her statement to the court, choking up, she said she had returned in her mind regularly to the time she drove her daughter to the SAT test center in 2017. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Turn around. Just turn around.\u2019 To my eternal shame, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe went on to describe how she\u2019d planned to use the same approach to help her other daughter gain admission to college, discussed it with her husband, but decided against it.\n\nImagine for a moment that James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Nellie Ohr, Andrew Weissmann or any of the other top level Obama administration officials who had conspired to throw a presidential election through a fraudulently predicated \u201ccounterintelligence investigation\u201d against Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and accompanying press smear campaign made a similar admission of guilt and show of contrition. Imagine the restoration of credibility that would ensue for all the federal agencies that were implicated in this scheme. Imagine the collective healing that could begin in a nation torn asunder by what was the worst crime committed against our nation in its history.\n\nWhat is now patently obvious for all who have eyes to see is that these top Obama administration officials, and many others, conspired with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, with foreign operatives in the employ of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign, with allied intelligence services, and with members of the US \u201cjournalism\u201d community to perpetrate the most vicious assault on the integrity of our constitutional republic in its history - by far.\n\nBenedict Arnold was pursued by Continental Army forces after Arnold\u2019s plan to turn over the vital American military fortifications at West Point, New York was exposed. Had he been captured, he would have been hung.\n\nAre the crimes committed by those who conspired to subvert our presidential election in 2016 and then, failing that, to overturn the will of the American people through the engineered creation of a \u201cspecial counsel\u201d investigation following the election of Donald Trump as president, of a character any less egregious than the crimes of Major General Arnold? I think not.\n\nHillary Clinton is alleged to have told an aide, following an interview with Matt Lauer during the 2016 presidential campaign in which he asked, in her view, some impertinent questions regarding her mishandling of classified information: \u201cIf that f***ing bastard [Trump] wins, we all hang from nooses.\u201d\n\nAs I wrote in a column last year, perhaps Hillary was telegraphing through this comment her awareness of the gravity of the crimes in which her campaign was engaged, in concert with the Obama administration, and the consequences all those involved would face should Trump prove victorious. He did prove victorious, of course.\n\nThe investigations by Attorney General Barr and John Durham, his top prosecutor looking into the provenance of the counterintelligence investigation against the Trump campaign, continue apace and we will see where they lead. But make no mistake. Where they lead will determine the future of our country as a viable republic.\n\nIf it is perceived by the American people that our Justice Department, FBI, CIA, NSA, State Department and Defense Department (for example, through its \u201cOffice of Net Assessment\u201d) can be weaponized by one political party for the purpose of taking out the other major political party\u2019s presidential candidate with impunity, then we are done. The Great Experiment will have failed.\n\nIn fact, this battle we face is not unlike that which the United Kingdom is confronting following the popular vote to remove Britain from the European Union through the so-called Brexit. The British people spoke loudly and clearly. They wanted out. Yet Britain\u2019s version of the Deep State has fought tooth and nail to prevent the expressed will of the British people from being realized. The obstructionists have thrown roadblock on top of roadblock to stop Brexit from occurring. It is a stark rejection of the will of a majority of the British people. They may forever be captive to the byzantine and oppressive bureaucracy in Brussels known as the European Union. Time will tell if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson can pull off a Winston Churchill and pull a sovereign Great Britain back from the brink of extinction.\n\nIf, as I fervently hope, James Comey and his treasonous cohorts are found guilty of, say, seditious conspiracy, I hope that the former FBI Director will stand with humility before the court and his countrymen and say: \u201cI broke the law. I have admitted that and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period.\u201d\n\nImagine the restoration of our nation\u2019s soul that would follow. One can dream.\n\nWilliam F. Marshall has been an intelligence analyst and investigator in the government, private, and non-profit sectors for more than 30 years.
