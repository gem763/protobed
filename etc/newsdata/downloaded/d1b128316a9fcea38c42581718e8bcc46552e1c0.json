The result is Cheika\u2019s final game in charge, while superstars, including David Pocock, are also never expected to wear the Aussie gold again. England is now through to the semi-finals to play the winner of Saturday night\u2019s other blockbuster between the All Blacks and Ireland. Stream the Rugby World Cup 2019 on KAYO SPORTS.

So that\u2019s pretty gutting\u2026 because we have a lot of guys who are leaving.\n\n\u201cWe played an attacking style of rugby which I think really threatened the English today. What the English did well was they controlled the re-starts and we weren\u2019t able to exit our areas well and on the flip side of that we weren\u2019t able to re-start and get back into the game.\u201d\n\nA devastated Wallabies coach Michael Cheika after the game couldn\u2019t control his emotions when asked in his post-match interview to explain where it all went wrong.\n\nHe said he was: \u201cSo f***ing disappointed.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to get this done for the people here, for Australians.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want all the Australians that are here to know that they put their bodies on the line. They gave it everything. We made a few mistakes at different times, but they\u2019ve given it everything.\n\n\u201cI sort of don\u2019t have much more to say to be honest.\u201d\n\nHe then walked off \u2013 and it\u2019s expected to be the final time Aussie supporters see him as Wallabies coach.\n\nIn his post match press conference, Cheika bristled and refused to respond to questions about his uncertain future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cruel, cruel world when you\u2019re asking those questions two minutes after being knocked out of a World Cup,\u201d Cheika said.\n\n\u201cIf you can find it in your heart, ask the relevant questions. Just think about people\u2019s feelings for a moment.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the game responded to the disappointing end to the game.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tyson Otto"], "top_image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/4df227422aa4fb0084c0911fd16279b6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
