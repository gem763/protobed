Here\u2019s what it did to me and why I would take it again", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ve just endured the world\u2019s newest longest flight, a 16,200 kilometre (10,100 mile), nonstop ultra-marathon from New York to Sydney. It took about 19 and a half hours, and was almost as demanding as that sounds.\n\nThe record-breaking Qantas Airways Ltd. flight touched down early Sunday morning in Australia. The Boeing Co. Dreamliner delivered its few dozen passengers \u2014 including yours truly \u2014 to their destination more or less intact, even if some of us were not quite sure what day it was.\n\nQantas wants to begin flying the time-saving route commercially as soon as 2022, so the airline used this test trip to explore ways to reduce its inevitable downside: Soul-crushing, body-buckling jet lag. Here\u2019s how my journey unfolded in real time.\n\nOff the Ground\n\nOur plane has just left JFK International Airport, and it\u2019s already become a flying laboratory. Since the goal is to adapt to our destination\u2019s time zone as fast as possible, we click into the Sydney clock right off the bat. That means no snoozing. The lights stay up and we\u2019re under instructions to stay awake for at least six hours \u2014 until it\u2019s evening in Australia.\n\nThe lights stay up and we're under instructions to stay awake for at least six hours\n\nThis immediately causes trouble for some passengers.\n\nDown one side of the business-class section, six Qantas frequent flyers are following a pre-planned schedule for eating and drinking (including limiting alcohol), exercise and sleep. They wear movement and light readers on their wrists and have been asked to log their activities; they\u2019ve already been under observation for a few days and will be monitored for 21 days in total. Most of them are bingeing on movies or reading books, but one of them is dozing within minutes. To be fair, I feel his pain. It may be the middle of the day in Sydney, but my body is telling me it\u2019s pushing midnight back in New York.\n\nTwo Hours In\n\nIt\u2019s feeding time, and a key moment in the experiment. The specially designed dishes are supposed to fire me up, and a flavorful serving of poached prawns with chili and lime is like a gentle culinary slap in the face. Spicy Chinese-style cod with jasmine rice and sesame seeds repeats the explosive action. I\u2019m momentarily awake.\n\nA flavorful serving of poached prawns with chili and lime is like a gentle culinary slap in the face\n\nThe plane\u2019s 40 passengers, including media, are all in business class: With so few passengers, nobody needs to travel economy. In an interview, chief executive Alan Joyce tells me the real Project Sunrise flights \u2014 if they go ahead \u2014 will have more legroom in economy than standard planes, and there will be some space at the back of the aircraft for stretching.\n\nThe six human guinea pigs at the heart of the research are seated on one side of the cabin. I want to do my own set of tests to see how my body is holding up.\n\nAfter speaking to a travel doctor in Sydney before the trip, I\u2019m armed with equipment to monitor my blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen-saturation levels. I\u2019ve also got a memory test and a mood questionnaire. I want to see if a flight this long impairs my brain or dims my spirits.\n\nThe three-hourly tests I take during the first half of the flight reflect the demands of this trip. My blood pressure is elevated, though not high, and my heart rate picking up. My mood is light, though darkening very gradually.\n\nThree Hours In\n\nThe physical pressure of this experiment is clear. Around me, passengers are standing up just to stay awake. The crew have been asked to keep sleep diaries, and to use iPads to rate their fatigue, reaction times, workload and stress. That dozy frequent flyer at the front of the plane is asleep, again.\n\nIt looks like cabaret, but beating jet lag is serious business\n\nWhile I\u2019m finding this regime fairly challenging \u2014 and I\u2019m not even in a do-it-tough economy seat \u2014 I try to keep things in perspective. After I first wrote about this upcoming flight last week, one reader emailed to urge me into a stouter mindset. During the Korean War in the early 1950s, he said, he regularly flew 40-hour reconnaissance missions with crew rotations every six hours. \u201cMan up,\u201d the 83-year-old told me. Point taken.\n\nFour Hours In\n\nMarie Carroll, a professor at the University of Sydney who\u2019s overseeing the passenger research on the flight, rallies her troops at the back of the plane. \u201cThis is the time, guys, when we really have to work through this,\u201d she tells them. Moments later, they\u2019re leaning against the food trolleys in the galley, stretching. Next, they perform upright press-ups among the empty economy sets. As a finale, they attempt synchronized dance moves in the aisles. All in the name of science.\n\nIt looks like cabaret, but beating jet lag is serious business. Beyond the sleepless nights and daytime fatigue, experts say critical processes including heart function and metabolism are upset when the body clock gets disrupted.\n\nSeven Hours In\n\nA second meal arrives. For me, being fed twice in a relatively quick succession has really helped time pass quickly during the first part of the flight. This part of the menu should mean the next few hours slip by too: It\u2019s heavy on carbohydrates and designed to send us to sleep. The sweet potato soup with creme fraiche is thick and luxurious, the toasted cheese sandwich less so. The chef on the plane tells me he\u2019s been preparing our meals for three days.\n\nThe lights are dimmed at last, and it feels like I\u2019ve been released. I crash for six hours straight. That\u2019s longer than I can remember sleeping without waking on any other flight, even with the business-class privilege of a flat bed.\n\nFourteen Hours In\n\nAcross the board, my own medical tests suggest I\u2019m coping. My blood pressure, which the doctor in Sydney said would be a good gauge of stress and fatigue, is back to normal. My heart\u2019s pumping slower, I ace my memory test, and my questionnaire shows my mood is brighter.\n\nThe research on the passengers and crew will feed into Project Sunrise, Qantas\u2019s plan to start direct commercial services connecting Sydney with New York and London. Other super-long flights from Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard to South America and Africa might follow, Qantas says.\n\nOn board, Joyce tells me he\u2019ll \u201cabsolutely\u201d roll out this flight\u2019s regime on his other long routes \u2014 if the science shows it helps. The trick is accommodating those who want to drink and snooze at will, Joyce says.\n\nBut don\u2019t go booking your round-the-world flights just yet. Qantas needs new planes from Boeing or Airbus SE that can do the job with a full load of passengers, and a new deal with crew to work longer than 20 hours. \u201cIt needs everything to come together,\u201d Joyce says. He initially had dreams of turning these super-long flights into flying hotels, with sleeping berths or a work-out zone. That vision gave way to reality when profit margins proved too tight to waste space on such luxuries.\n\nOur plane doesn\u2019t have the range to haul a full load of passengers with luggage to Sydney. It took off with its fuel tanks maxed out \u2014 about 101 tons. To keep the weight down, there\u2019s no cargo, and food and drink are limited. In New York, the captain had seemed confident we\u2019d make it to Sydney with gas to spare. He planned on landing with six tons of fuel, enough to stay airborne for another 90 minutes.\n\nSeventeen Hours In\n\nBreakfast time, and there\u2019s no limp sausage. Instead, it\u2019s a bowl of ancient grains, avocado puree, warm haloumi cheese and a herb salad. This flight is turning everything on its head.\n\n\n\nIt took discipline and work to stick to the no-sleep routine in the first half of this flight\n\nOne of the frequent flyers, Sydney-based investor Nick Mole, says he got almost eight hours\u2019 sleep and feels good. What about a full day\u2019s work after landing? \u201cI probably could do that,\u201d he says. He thinks the bigger test will be how he copes in a couple of days.\n\nPreparing to Land\n\nI feel better now than I did after flying to New York from Sydney a few days ago with one stop. The dozen or so hours it took to reach Los Angeles were followed by a grating hour and a half queuing at immigration with hundreds of other zombified travelers.\n\nAs our plane approaches its destination, Joyce addresses everybody on board. He tells us the flight has given him more confidence that Project Sunrise can work. And come Sunday lunchtime in Sydney, I\u2019m feeling jaded but far from debilitated. I even make it through a children\u2019s birthday party, surely an acid test of anyone\u2019s nerves.\n\nPersonally, I would choose a direct Sydney-New York flight over one with a layover. But it won\u2019t suit everyone: It took discipline and work to stick to the no-sleep routine in the first half of this flight. There may be a benefit to switching to the destination time immediately, but it comes at a price. I feel like I had to earn it.\n\nThe author traveled to New York at Bloomberg\u2019s expense to join the Qantas flight back to Sydney.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Flying laboratory explored ways to reduce soul-crushing, body-buckling jet lag", "authors": ["Angus Whitley", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/qantas-plane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
