I remember eating in the restaurant with my parents; I did not remember the Cheshire\u2019s Anglophilia \u2014 every room named for an English author. I went looking for my favorites, Nancy Mitford and Anthony Trollope (fourth floor). The more obscure ones, like Elizabeth Gaskell, give the inn an intellectual air. We stayed in the George Gissing room (a volume of \u201cThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\u201d sat on a side table). The walls in the corridors were covered with art, including Fores \u2019s 19th-century Coaching Recollections, knights in armor, young women looking innocent, young men looking stiff. A gas station was still just up the street, on an island between Clayton Road and Clayton Avenue, and out the back windows were modest neighborhoods of dark brick houses. This was not a resort.\n\nAll of the St. Louis neighborhoods, some boarded up, some so grand that they astounded even my unimpressible ex-realtor husband, Jack, from Philadelphia, and some of which were regular middle class streets, bump ed up against one another, faded into one another. Every time I\u2019ve returned, the late-19th-century houses have lured me, surprised me, made me look at the real estate pages in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But what set the houses off, made them seem jewel-like, were the huge oaks and small sassafras and maples, the chestnuts, rowans. The hills rose to the trees, displayed them; the houses peeked around them, flickered with shadows.\n\nI was there for my 50th high school reunion; time seemed to have collapsed behind me. Jack and I attended the events, but I wanted to investigate what had not changed \u2014 an obvious candidate was the Gateway Arch, which I first visited when it was still being built, in 1964. At that point, two silver curves pushed toward one another even as the architects worried that they might not meet. This time, whether they wash it or leave that to the rain, when we drove past, we were struck by its flashing gleam in the bright sunshine.", "description": "The author finds her hometown perhaps the most enlightening spot in America for exploring what America really is.", "authors": ["Jane Smiley"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/travel/14StLouis1/14StLouis1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
