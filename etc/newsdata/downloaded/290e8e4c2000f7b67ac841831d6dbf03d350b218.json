The trade policy issue in particular seems to be weighing on business investment.\"\n\nConsumer spending hit its highest level in more than four years in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday. This offset a massive drop in business investment during the period.\n\nBusiness investment contracted by 1% in the previous quarter. Initially, the BEA estimated a fall of 0.6%. The sharp drop in business investment comes as China and the U.S. wage a trade war against each other.\n\nSince last year, the world's largest economies have slapped tariffs on a bevy of each other's products. These moves have sent shockwaves through financial markets and have dampened the outlook for the U.S. economy.\n\n\"That concerns me because, ultimately, business investment is where we get the future productive capacity of the economy,\" Quarles said.\n\nHe noted, however: \"Every time I talk to bankers across the country, our reserve bank presidents and the input they receive \u2026 it's really quite positive with respect to actual activity and generally with respect to sentiment.\"\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point earlier this month, citing concerns about the global economy and \"muted inflation pressures.\"\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.", "description": "The U.S. economy is doing well even as worries over the country's trade policy are hurting business investment, a top Fed official says.", "authors": ["Fred Imbert"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105188162-GettyImages-924650070.jpg?v=1569588423"}
