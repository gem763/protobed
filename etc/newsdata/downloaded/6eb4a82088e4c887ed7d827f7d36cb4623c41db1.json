Upon payment of the money, applicants were granted both a learner's licence and a driver's licence without being tested, the Hawks' Manase Phukubye said.\n\nAccording to Phukubye, one of the suspects arrested was the owner of the Sammy Driving School in Sannieshof, whose administration clerk allegedly collects the bribes. It is suspected that the two worked with the nine traffic department officials in the area.\n\nPhukubye said the driving school also allegedly provided learner's licence applicants with the answers before they sat for the exam. He said, during the exam, the learner drivers were allegedly allowed to copy from the answer sheets by examiners.\n\nThey will all appear in court again on April 5.\n\n\"Uprooting these types of crimes - fraud and corruption - will reduce accidents and deaths of innocent people on the roads and will minimise the unnecessary claims from the Road Accident Fund,\" said the Hawks' provincial head Major-General Linda Mbana.", "description": "The Hawks say they have arrested nine North West traffic officials, along with the owner of a driving school and his employee, for licence fraud.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5100/89fb1213129f4a629676d600f17c804f.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-24"}
