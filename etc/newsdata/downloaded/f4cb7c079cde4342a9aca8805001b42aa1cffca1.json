All in all, the investigation seems to have been very, very poor in terms of family support.\u201d\n\nQuestioning the methods used by police during the investigation, Mr Babu added: \u201cIn terms of the investigation, there are a few things to be factored in \u2013 like seizing her passport and whether a test was done for alcohol or drugs.\n\n\u201cI think you would consider seizing the suspect\u2019s passport \u2013 you would consider it if you had concerns about her leaving. The investigation has not been done with sufficient vigour. Northamptonshire Police is a small force so would they have the necessary expertise?\u201d", "description": "The family of a teenager who was killed in a car crash with\u00a0the wife of an American\u00a0diplomat\u00a0have said they are planning to sue the Trump administration\u00a0for lawless misconduct and a cover-up.
