The show will be streamed on Hot Air\u2019s Facebook page and embedded here and on the show page for those who are not on Facebook.\n\nJoin us as we welcome:\n\nDuane \u201cGeneralissimo\u201d Patterson brings us up to date on the week\u2019s top stories and gives us a preview of tomorrow\u2019s Hugh Hewitt show. We\u2019ll review the latest nuttiness from last nights climate-change marathon on CNN, including Joe Biden\u2019s mystery bloody eyeball and how the media studiously ignored it. Will Democrats make population control through abortion a key plank in their platform? Duane and I will also debate Brexit and determine which of us is a great big girl\u2019s blouse and which is a chlorinated chicken.\n\nNo seriously, the Brits really know insults, right?\n\nCan conservatives turn Minnesota away from its current status as a progressive playground? Ian Walters tells us about next week\u2019s CPAC Minnesota being staged by the American Conservative Union right here in the Twin Cities. It takes place on September 11 with the theme Some People Did Something, and it will take a positive look at our first responders and the challenges conservatives face here in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\n\n\nThe Ed Morrissey Show and its dynamic chatroom can be seen on the permanent TEMS page. Be sure to join us, and don\u2019t forget to keep up with the debate on my Facebook page, too!\n\nHow can Republicans and conservatives keep winning after 2016?
