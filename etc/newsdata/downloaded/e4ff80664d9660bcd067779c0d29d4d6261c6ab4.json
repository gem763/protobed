Microsoft joined the scheme in May.\n\n'Share your data'\n\nIn his annual assessment, King welcomed moves from the platforms such as launching public libraries of political advertisements, labeling the ads according to who is paying for them, promoting media literacy and fighting bots.\n\nHowever, he said the positive steps were undercut by a lack of access to data on those ads for independent researchers. Researchers warn that failing to give them access to data or providing partial visibility makes it difficult to check just how effective the efforts are, and opens the door for undetected growth of fake news online.\n\nWhile the Commission, which is due to turn over before the end of this year, is toughening its rhetoric, hard rules are not on its immediate agenda. A formal evaluation of platforms' performance on disinformation is due to be delivered by an independent consultant in January 2020, prompting further recommendations for the new Commission.\n\nOne possibility for regulation is that platforms might be compelled to share their data more openly.\n\nThe report published Tuesday suggests that there is a need for a mechanism that allows independent researchers to cooperate with platforms through privacy-compliant access to datasets.\n\nFacebook, for example, reports that between March and April, they took action against more than 600,000 ads in the EU for violating its policies. Verifying these figures independently is next to impossible.\n\n\u201cThe platforms still very jealously guard their information \u2014 not just their core algorithms, but the information about what's happening on their platforms,\u201d King said.\n\nThe Commission is particularly worried about a European-based industry selling fake social media engagement that looks legitimate to the untrained eye.\n\n\u201cIf a platform like Facebook, with their resources and their knowledge, can't figure out that thousands of coordinated accounts with random two-letter names are suspicious and are engaging in this kind of activity in the context of the elections, then we still have some way to go,\u201d King said.", "description": "The bloc\u2019s executive arm says platforms need to get more transparent on how they fight fake news \u2014 or face regulation.", "authors": ["Melissa Heikkil\u00e4", "Bjarke Smith-Meyer"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-615363060-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
