The law is notably similar to a Texas law struck down in the Supreme Court only three years ago.\n\nIn February, the high court blocked enforcement of the law, while further legal appeals were being filed. Chief Justice John Roberts sided with his more liberal colleagues at the time.\n\nCLARENCE THOMAS ABSENT 'DUE TO ILLNESS' AS SUPREME COURT BEGINS NEW TERM\n\nAdditionally, four Justices can compel the other five to hear a case, because there does not have to be a majority.\n\n\"So, theoretically, the four most conservative Justices \u2013 Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Alito \u2013 could very well have decided that the decision to invalidate the Texas law three years ago needs to be changed,\" Napolitano added.\n\n\"And, it is probably, more pro-life,\" he said. \"So, they probably want to review this opinion to decide if they can uphold it.\"\n\nNapolitano continued, explaining that the \"fear of the pro-choice crowd\" when it comes to this case is that \"this new Supreme Court will allow the states to narrow the circumstances under which an abortion can be had.\"\n\nAbortion rights supporters say Act 620 is too restrictive and places an \"undue burden\" on a woman's access to the medical procedure. They say it would leave the state with just one abortion clinic.\n\nSupporters of the law say it is a reasonable regulation, with attorneys saying in court filings on behalf of Louisiana Health Secretary Rebekah Gee that \"Louisiana abortion clinics have a history of serious health and safety problems.\"\n\n\"Louisiana argues it's for the health and safety of the mother and of the fetus. The other side says it's a subterfuge to narrow the circumstances under which abortions can be had. The court will decide it,\" Napolitano said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Here's the thing: the decision's going to land right before the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention next spring,\" he told the \"Fox & Friends\" co-hosts. \"Whichever way it goes, it's going to be a bombshell!\"\n\nThe high court will now set a briefing schedule, with oral arguments early next year and a ruling expected by June 2020.\n\nShannon Bream and Bill Mears contributed to this report.", "description": "The Supreme Court's pending decision on a Louisiana abortion law will be a \"bombshell,\" Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/49827eb2-fox-and-friends.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
