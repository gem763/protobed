If you approve, then those tags will be added to the photo.\n\nPreviously, if you uploaded a photo, Facebook would automatically suggest friends to tag in the photo based on the faces it recognised in the image \u2013 a service which used some form of facial recognition to offer the suggested tags.\n\nIt\u2019s a subtle change to how Facebook works, but it\u2019s a crucial one: It puts control of face recognition in the hands of users rather than automatically using software to recognise users.\n\nFacebook Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s a change that comes in the wake of a historic $US5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nIn addition to the monetary fine, Facebook was forced to \u201cclearly and conspicuously\u201d disclose any use of facial-recognition software, \u201cseparate and apart from any \u2018privacy policy,\u2019 \u2018data policy,\u2019 \u2018statement of rights and responsibilities\u2019 page, or other similar document,\u201d according to the FTC settlement.\n\nMore simply: Facebook now has to explicitly ask user permission to use facial-recognition software.\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook still has incredible control over your data\n\n\n\nIf you choose to opt in, Facebook says it primarily uses face recognition data for two things: photo tagging and identity protection.\n\nIn addition to suggesting photos you might be in, opting in to face recognition also means Facebook will keep a lookout for anyone else on the service pretending to be you. \u201cWe can help protect against someone using your photo to impersonate you,\u201dthe information page says.\n\nThe changes are already in effect all over the world, and some users with specific settings will start seeing prompts to opt in to face recognition starting today.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
