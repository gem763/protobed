His party has enjoyed a lead in Quebec polls since the last election. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press)\n\n\"It's up to Quebecers to choose and Quebecers have chosen,\" Legault said Wednesday of a law that bans religious symbols in parts of the civil service.\n\nBut the roots of the new Quebec nationalism go well beyond Legault's sweeping election victory last year.\n\nIt's a political mindset that has displaced sovereignty as the main alternative to federalism and, as the first week of the campaign has already made clear, will define how the leaders court votes in the province this fall.\n\nCivic vs ethnic nationalism\n\nThe nationalism that currently holds sway is conservative. It is based on a holistic conception of Quebec society that prioritizes the historical experience of francophones.\n\nIt's mainly worried that the combination of immigration and official multiculturalism will make francophone Quebec culture more vulnerable in an increasingly interconnected world where English is the lingua franca.\n\nNo surprise then that cutting immigration levels and protecting Quebec's secular identity were the chief highlights of Legault's first year in office.\n\nHe has sworn off sovereignty since his days in the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, but the origins of the conservative nationalism that his government espouses can nevertheless be traced to the movement's most decisive moment: the night of the second referendum.\n\nThat night, Jacques Parizeau, the PQ premier, opted to improvise his concession speech. \"We are beaten, it is true,\" he said. \"But by what, basically? By money and ethnic votes.\"\n\nQuebec Premier Jacques Parizeau giving the concession speech on Oct. 30, 1995, in which he blamed 'money and ethnic votes.' (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)\n\nAlready in crisis following the narrow defeat, the sovereignty movement was split in its reaction to Parizeau's comments.\n\nThere were those who were horrified and spent the ensuing years trying to expunge the movement of any hint of ethnic nationalism; trying to promote a more inclusive, civic-style nationalism instead.\n\nAnd there were those who believed Parizeau was right, and sought to emphasize the history of French-Canadians in their version of Quebec nationalism.\n\nAt the outset, the civic nationalists had the upper-hand.\n\n\"After 1995, because of Mr. Parizeau's comments, there was a tendency within the sovereigntist milieu to adhere to a Trudeauist conception of society,\" said \u00c9ric B\u00e9dard, a prominent Quebec historian whose writings helped spark the revival of conservative nationalism.\n\n\"Why claim a special status, maybe even Quebec sovereignty, if fundamentally we adhere to the spirit of Canadian multiculturalism?\"\n\nBut the reasonable accommodation crisis, which lasted roughly between 2006 and 2008, tipped the scales in the other direction.\n\nThe three federal leaders who attended the first debate of the election were asked about Quebec's Bill 21. 2:37\n\nThe rise of the conservative nationalists\n\nAs debate raged in the province about whether minority cultural practices represented a threat to Quebec's secular society, conservative nationalists mounted a fierce attack on multiculturalism.\n\nB\u00e9dard and others argued the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and its application by federally appointed judges, was too accommodating of minorities, at the expense of a historically rooted Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois culture.\n\nAccording to a conservative nationalist reading of the past, this culture is defined by the solidarity forged among francophones fighting for their survival. And the legacy of this solidarity is a willingness to value collective rights over individual ones.\n\nLegault's sweeping victory in the 2018 provincial election consolidated the rise of conservative nationalism in Quebec. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press)\n\nThat, they said, is what a secularism law could do: protect the collective rights of Quebecers to live in a secular society against individuals who use the charter to carve out space for their religious practices.\n\nThis argument eventually found a sympathetic ear in PQ leader Pauline Marois, who was desperate to restore her party's fortunes after a disastrous performance in the 2007 election.\n\nMarois brought several conservative nationalists, including B\u00e9dard, into her inner circle.\n\nIt was a collaboration that ultimately produced the Charter of Values, a proposed secularism law that would have banned religious symbols from large parts of the civil service.\n\nThe charter died on the order paper when the PQ lost the 2014 election. But conservative nationalists didn't blame the charter for the loss. They blamed Marois's focus on sovereignty.\n\nThe CAQ's successful 2018 election campaign was based on a similar reading of the political climate in the province.\n\n\"The CAQ is in the process of fostering a nationalism without sovereignty. And that's the winning formula at the moment,\" said Jacques Beauchemin, a sociologist and former adviser to Marois whose writings also played a big role in the nationalist revival.\n\n\"They are proposing a nationalism that suits Quebec of today; a nationalism that is not afraid of affirming things, like with Bill 21 (the secularism law).\"\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, left, lauded Legault's nationalism in his opening speech of the campaign. (Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press)\n\nOf obstacles and opportunities\n\nThe federal election campaign thus opens in Quebec at a moment of deep suspicion about federal institutions.\n\nLegault, and other defenders of Bill 21, have actively sought to delegitimize the charter and the court system charged with upholding it, fearing their power to strike down the law.\n\nHis government, moreover, seeks not simply to defend provincial jurisdiction, but expand it in key areas, like immigration.\n\nIn the meantime, multiculturalism, as both a policy and a value, is cast in ever darker terms by government officials and popular columnists.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer has been targeting former Bloc voters in Quebec. (Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe grid laid down by the new Quebec nationalism offers different opportunities and obstacles to the three main contenders in the province.\n\nIt helps explain why, when launching his campaign, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet began with a paean to the nationalism of the CAQ government. Sovereignty received only a second-order mention.\n\nIt also provides an explanation for why Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has been more timid than Justin Trudeau in his criticism of Bill 21.\n\nNow that conservative nationalism has been shorn of its sovereigntist trappings, the Tories are trying to win over voters who once backed the Bloc.\n\nThere is, however, only so much Scheer can offer without departing from his federalist bedrock and alienating supporters in the West.\n\nOf the three then, the Liberals would seem to have the most to lose from the present configuration.\n\nTrudeau is seeking a delicate balance with his position on Bill 21, trying to present his pro-charter federalism as no immediate threat to the law without forsaking a document that's at the core of his party's identity.\n\nBut the Liberals, it bears recalling, have maintained a healthy lead in Quebec polls since the last election.
