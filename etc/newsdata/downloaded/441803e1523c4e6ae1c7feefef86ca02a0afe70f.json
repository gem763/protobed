Days Later They Arrested Him.", "language": "en", "text": "When Houston immigration activist Roland Gramajo Reyes invited U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to a public meeting for people worried about being arrested due to their immigration status, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d end up behind bars.\n\nHe was wrong.\n\nGramajo\u2019s longtime advocacy on behalf of Houston\u2019s immigrant and Latino communities, family, attorney, and allies said, make them seriously doubt that the timing of his apprehension was an accident.\n\n\u201cWe want to believe these are coincidences,\u201d said Cesar Espinosa, executive director of FIEL Houston, which advocates for immigrant communities in Houston. \u201cUnfortunately, the more and more we see them, the more we feel that some people who are speaking out against the administration or ICE are being targeted by those same agencies.\u201d\n\nNow, Gramajo, 40, is caught in a tug-of-war between law enforcement agencies seeking to either deport him after 25 cumulative years in the United States, or to first incarcerate him for improper entry into the United States, a charge that could land him in prison.\n\n\u201cHis bond was denied Monday by a federal judge, so he will remain in detention while his illegal reentry charges are resolved,\u201d Raed Gonzalez, Gramajo\u2019s attorney, told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe are trying to reopen his immigration case\u2026 Many hurdles await us, but we are trying our best.\u201d\n\nGramajo, a father of five and grandfather of two, was born in Retalhuleu, Guatemala in 1979, and first moved to Houston at age 15. Since then, he has made the improvement of the Guatemalan community and his adopted hometown his life\u2019s mission.\n\nHe founded the Centro Organizativo Guatemalteco, which raises funds for humanitarian causes in Guatemala, as well as the Southwest American Systems Chamber of Commerce, which helps minority children participate in sports and beauty pageants. After Hurricane Harvey devastated the city in 2017, he took weeks off work to organize community efforts in helping those affected by the storm\u2019s flooding that caused an estimated $125 billion in damage. For his work, Gramajo has received commendations from a host of state and local organizations, including the Alief Independent School District, Houston Community College, the Golden Eagle Society, and the Houston City Council.\n\nOnly days before his apprehension by ICE, Gramajo had organized a \u201cknow your rights\u201d seminar for undocumented immigrants and their families in the city\u2014the seminar to which he had invited immigration agents to participate. That invitation, Gramajo\u2019s defenders believe, may have unintentionally goaded ICE into looking into Gramajo\u2019s immigration status, a charge ICE has called \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be abundantly clear, ICE personnel did not attend this Immigration Forum in any capacity\u2014official or unofficial,\u201d the agency released in a statement last week, saying that Gramajo became a target after ICE received an anonymous tip about his status. \u201cTo portray him in one-sided media reports\u2026 as a victim of some \u2018covert\u2019 law enforcement operation is an insulting affront to public safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna be able to comment any further on the anonymous tip\u201d that led to Gramajo\u2019s apprehension, ICE spokesperson Tim Oberle told The Daily Beast when asked about the timing of the tip that lead to his arrest, \u201cbecause it\u2019s anonymous, obviously.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of ICE\u2019s deportation case is Gramajo\u2019s 1998 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of burglary of a vehicle, for which he was sentenced to 20 days in prison. Gramajo\u2019s family told reporters in Houston that the charge was the result of a practical joke that he had played on a friend, the vehicle\u2019s owner.\n\nAfter his plea, immigration authorities commenced deportation proceedings against Gramajo, culminating in his deportation to Guatemala in summer 2004. Gramajo returned months later to be with his family in Houston\u2014including his wife and children\u2014and has remained ever since.\n\nIt\u2019s that 2004 illegal entry for which Gramajo will stand trial. If he is found guilty, he could face a six-month prison sentence before his potential deportation.\n\n\u201cMy sons, they are texting me asking how is their father, and that\u2019s what hurts the most,\u201d Magaly Quicano, Gramajo\u2019s wife, told reporters in Houston last week. \u201cI\u2019ve been praying, praying praying that he will win this immigration battle.\u201d\n\nGramajo\u2019s defenders, who count members of Houston\u2019s political establishment among their members, told The Daily Beast that the potential deportation of the father of five is disgraceful.\n\n\u201cThe prospect of deporting Mr. Gramajo is outrageous,\u201d Mayor pro tem Ellen Cohen, a member of the Houston City Council, told The Daily Beast. Last year, the city council commended Gramajo as \u201cdedicated to serving and inspiring the community,\u201d and whose \u201cqualities represent a true leader with an exceptional drive to improve the quality of life\u201d throughout the city.\n\n\u201cHis so-called \u2018crime\u2019 of coming back to this country\u2014his country\u2014after his 2004 deportation is a result of unjust laws. If I were in his shoes, I would have tried to find a way back to my spouse and children too,\u201d Cohen added, noting that she has called upon ICE to immediately release him. \u201cHe is an asset to Houston and there is no legitimate public safety-related reason to deport him again. If ICE\u2019s concern is public safety, they should be focusing their limited resources on those who are bringing violence, drugs, and human trafficking in to our communities.\u201d\n\nHouston City Council member Steve Le, who brought forth a successful proposal last year to name May 17, 2018 as \u201cRoland Omar Gramajo Reyes Day\u201d in the city, called Gramajo \u201ca good person and community leader\u201d whose presence in the city makes it a better place to live.\n\n\u201cOur office appreciates everything he has done for the community and recognized him with a Mayoral Proclamation for his achievements,\u201d Le told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe were surprised by his arrest and hope the court will take into account all the great contributions he has made when determining his sentencing. We look forward to a favorable outcome for his family and our community.\u201d\n\nBut after a judge denied his bond in a hearing on Monday, Gramajo will remain in federal detention until trial. Even if he wins his criminal case, his presence in the United States is far from assured\u2014if deported, Gramajo will be barred from entering the United States for 20 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the verdict will be, but I leave everything in the hands of God and wait,\u201d Quicano said tearfully. \u201cNo more.\u201d", "description": "Roland Gramajo Reyes\u2019 attempt to help his community better understand the law may have landed him in ICE detention.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568872938/190917-bixby-ice-tease_wbmevk", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
