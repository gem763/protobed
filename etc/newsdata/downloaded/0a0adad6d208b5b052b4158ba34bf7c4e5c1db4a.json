A Texas media outlet took his comments out of context, the sheriff said. The site later issued a correction to the story.\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House on Thursday, Tarrant County Sheriff Bill Waybourn spoke about the number of \u201cillegal aliens\u201d in his jail on drunk driving charges\u2013including a large percentage of repeat offenders. The sheriff joined U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Matthew Albence during a press conference regarding the latest ruling by a California federal court on immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cThis morning, we had 4,200 inmates,\u201d Sheriff Waybourn said during the press conference. \u201cOut of that, 7 percent were illegal aliens.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf those people that we have in custody, we know for a fact that 72 percent of them are repeat offenders,\u201d Waybourn said. \u201cSo if we have to turn them loose or they get released, they\u2019re coming back to your neighborhood and my neighborhood. These drunks will run over your children and they will run over my children.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Tribune reportedly mischaracterized the comments, making it appear he referred to all migrants as \u201cdrunks,\u201d WFAA ABC8 reported. The Texas Tribune later corrected its article stating:\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized statements by Tarrant County Sheriff Bill E. Waybourn, who said undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions would be a threat to the public.\n\nWhile the sheriff was commenting on a specific subset of individuals incarcerated in his jail, Hispanic organizations and a Texas lawmaker mounted attacks and called for the resignation of the elected lawman.\n\nLULAC Director Domingo Garcia told WFAA, \u201cHe needs to apologize and take those words back. He accuses undocumented immigrants of being drunks who are going to run over your kids and his kids.\u201d\n\nGarcia continued, \u201cWhen he accuses undocumented immigrants of being drunks who are going to run over your kids and his kids, it follows a dangerous rhetoric.\u201d\n\nWaybourn insisted he was not speaking about all migrants, but only those in his jail charged with multiple drunk driving offenses.\n\n\u201cI was referring to the repeat offenders that are in our jail,\u201d the sheriff explained. \u201cThat goes for any repeat drunk offender that they\u2019re likely to repeat it again.\u201d\n\nTexas State Representative Ramon Romero, Jr., (D-Fort Worth) did not appear to be satisfied.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something new,\u201d Romero told WFAA. \u201cHe just did it on such a big stage he couldn\u2019t get away with it. He should resign for his policies. He shouldn\u2019t resign for his mouth because that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d\n\nWaybourn said the Texas Tribune got his comments wrong.\n\n\u201cIf you see the headline that says, \u2018Bill Waybourn said all immigrants are drunks,\u2019 that\u2019s awful \u2026 but I didn\u2019t say that,\u201d the sheriff told the local ABC affiliate.\n\nTexas Tribune Editor-in-Chief Emily Ramshaw responded to an inquiry from WFAA regarding the original article and said, \u201cWe made a mistake, no question about it, and we corrected it as soon as we recognized it. We regret the error.\u201d\n\nBob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for the Breitbart Texas-Border team. He is an original member of the Breitbart Texas team.
