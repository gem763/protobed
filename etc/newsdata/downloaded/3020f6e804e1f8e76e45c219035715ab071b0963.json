The group has displaced tens of thousands of people and perpetrated widespread barbarism, including rapes and video-recorded beheadings.\n\nThe president made public Baghdadi\u2019s death during a nationally televised address at the White House, where he spoke for 48 minutes about an operation he likened to watching a movie in the Situation Room. The development, he said, showed the reach of the U.S. military and its ability to bring terrorists to justice.\n\n\u201cHe was a sick and depraved man and now he\u2019s gone,\u201d Mr. Trump said of Baghdadi. \u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is a much safer place.\u201d\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi was last seen publicly in a video released in April.

No U.S. personnel were reported injured, though a military dog that was hurt while pursuing Baghdadi into the tunnel was evacuated with U.S. troops. Officials gave no estimates of the number of people killed in the operation, but they are thought to include two of Baghdadi\u2019s wives.\n\nMr. Trump said the force encountered sporadic gunfire as it flew, then battled its way toward the compound where Baghdadi was believed to be hiding. The militant leader fled into what Mr. Trump described as a dead-end tunnel with three children, then detonated the explosive vest he was wearing.\n\nThe withdrawal of some U.S. troops in recent weeks cleared the way for Turkey to launch a cross-border incursion against Kurdish-led fighters it considers terrorists. Mr. Trump had already begun to reverse himself after declaring the pullout, with the White House saying that about 200 troops would remain in northeastern Syria to safeguard oil fields there.\n\nSince then, U.S. officials said Mr. Trump is considering leaving hundreds of troops in Syria for that purpose and is considering deploying dozens of tanks to support them.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said Baghdadi\u2019s death created an opportunity to refocus U.S. strategy in Syria around reducing the U.S.\u2019s presence, putting Kurds in control of oil resources and \u201cbuilding up the lives of people in the region.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a game changer in the war or terror,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cThe war is by no means over, but the caliphate is dead and the leader of the caliphate is dead, and that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump didn\u2019t notify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California or other Democratic leaders in Congress about the operation, saying he wanted to avoid information leaks, unlike the Obama administration\u2019s decision to alert key lawmakers in both parties ahead of the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nMrs. Pelosi also faulted the White House for notifying Russia of the operation but not Hill leaders.\n\n\u201cThe House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nBaghdadi\u2019s death came seven months after U.S.-supported forces seized the last of Islamic State\u2019s territory but still represented a significant loss to the group, U.S. officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is a major blow to them,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in an interview on CNN following Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\nIslamic State didn\u2019t confirm or deny reports of its leader\u2019s death, but some of the group\u2019s supporters responded to the news by offering condolences and prayers on the messaging platform Telegram, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, an Iraqi researcher who monitors the group\u2019s communication channels.\n\nAreas of control in Syria, Oct. 21 Syrian government Opposition forces Kurdish forces and allies Turkish army/Syrian opposition forces 50 miles turkey 50 km Kobani Ras al-Ain Tal-Abiad Hasakah Barisha Manbij Aleppo Raqqa iraq Idlib Euphrates R.

Syrian, Iraqi and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces officials each sought to claim credit for supporting the operation.\n\nA senior Turkish official said that Turkey had advance knowledge of the raid and possessed information indicating Baghdadi was in Idlib village some 48 hours before the operation took place, but didn\u2019t confirm or deny whether that intelligence was shared with the U.S.\n\nAn Iraqi intelligence official said the country had helped the U.S. identify Baghdadi\u2019s location.\n\nMazloum Abdi, the head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces that coordinated with the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, wrote on Twitter that the operation resulted from five months of joint intelligence work with the U.S.\n\nU.S. officials wouldn\u2019t say whether those intelligence sources were instrumental in Saturday\u2019s raid.\n\nRubble is seen Sunday at the site of helicopter gunfire that reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha.

Join the conversation below.\n\nVideos shared by local activists said to portray the operation\u2019s aftermath showed a charred vehicle, dead bodies and a demolished house. The Wall Street Journal couldn\u2019t verify the footage independently.\n\nBaghdadi, who was first seen declaring the terror group\u2019s global ambitions in July 2014 from the Iraqi city of Mosul, was last publicly heard from in September, when he sought to rally followers in an audio message. He was last seen in a video message released in April\u2014the first such known footage in nearly five years.\n\nBaghdadi has previously been wrongly reported killed, and Islamic State supporters expressed hopes on Telegram that news of his death would prove false this time, too: \u201cMay Allah make it that all the kuffar [infidel] media outlets are fake news,\u201d said one user called Fawwaz.\n\nShrinking Territory Areas of Islamic State control in Iraq and Syria 50 miles TURKEY 50 km Hasakah Aleppo Mosul Erbil Raqqa Deir Ezzour Kirkuk Med.

An estimated 30,000 to 60,000 militants are dispersed among the region\u2019s roughly three million civilians.\n\nDespite the various militant groups, Islamic State has lacked a public presence in Idlib province and didn\u2019t control territory, since rebel outfits expelled it from the area several years ago. Rebel commanders say Islamic State maintains sleeper cells throughout the country, however, and activist groups have previously tracked fleeing Islamic State commanders and their families, some of whom have ended up in Idlib.\n\nGiven its relative lawlessness, Idlib offers an apt place for such leaders to hide. Since the beginning of this year, the formerly al Qaeda-linked extremist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has controlled most of the province and itself is aligned with similar groups.\n\nBarisha, where the raid took place, is a tiny village controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham.\n\nA resident of a village next to Barisha said it had a population of 3,000 people years ago, but an additional 1,000 displaced people from other parts of Syria had moved there in recent years because of its proximity to the Turkish border and its relative safety.\n\nTurkey, which supports some rebels in the area, reached an agreement with Russia last year to avert fighting in Idlib. The pact was intended to create a demilitarized zone free of militants and heavy weapons.\n\nThe plan failed. Instead of withdrawing from certain areas, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham expanded its control to nearly the entire province, which is now being run by its political wing called the Salvation Government, while its militants repeatedly clashed with the Syrian army and Russian troops.\n\n\u2014Isabel Coles in Baghdad, Nancy A.
