In one exchange, Mark Forkner, a former chief technical pilot at Boeing, boasted that he was \u201cjedi-mind tricking regulators.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you see that this raises much concern about the level of coziness between Boeing personnel and FAA regulators?\u201d Wicker asked.\n\nMuilenburg, who claimed to have only seen the messages within the past couple of weeks, said that he \u201cunderstands the concern\u201d and that the sentiments of the remarks run \u201ccounter to our values.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who called the CEO\u2019s testimony \u201cquite dismaying,\u201d read through a 2016 text exchange between Forkner and Patrick Gustavsson, another test pilot, in which Forkner said the Max\u2019s maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as MCAS, was \u201crunning rampant.\u201d\n\nMCAS is a stabilization feature that was designed to force down the nose of the aircraft if its angle got too steep and thereby prevent the plane from stalling. It has been blamed as a factor in both crashes. Investigators have found that the system was triggered by faulty sensor data that erroneously indicated the planes were at risk of stalling.\n\nBut MCAS was not mentioned in the Max\u2019s flight manuals. The decision to leave out the information was made just months after Forkner and Gustavsson\u2019s text correspondence, which was given to the Justice Department in February.\n\nCruz slammed Muilenburg\u2019s claim that he had only seen the conversation this month, asking \u201chow in the hell did nobody bring this to your attention\u201d earlier this year.\n\nMuilenburg said that while he was \u201cmade aware of the existence of this kind of document,\u201d he \u201ccounted on my counsel to handle that appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the CEO. The buck stops with you,\u201d Cruz shot back. \u201cHow did your team not put it in front of you, run in with their hair on fire saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got a real problem here\u2019?\u201d he added.\n\nMuilenburg repeated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see the details of this exchange until recently\u201d and that he wasn\u2019t sure what Forkner meant in those texts, speculating that the pilot may have been speaking in reference to a simulation but noting that he couldn\u2019t be certain.\n\n\u201cI would walk before I was to get on the 737 Max,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) later said. \u201cI would walk. There\u2019s no way.\u201d\n\nMuilenburg is set to appear before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on Wednesday.", "description": "After 346 deaths, Dennis Muilenburg faced tough questions on why more wasn't done to address safety concerns about the plane.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db874a4210000aa3634b60d.jpeg?cache=xngehyqkau&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
