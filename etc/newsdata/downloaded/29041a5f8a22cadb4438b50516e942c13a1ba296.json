PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO NEW SEXUAL MISCONDUCT CHARGES, COULD FACE UP TO 12 ACCUSERS\n\nHeller gave the eyebrow-raising defense after the Oscar-winning actor was arraigned on four misdemeanor counts of sex abuse and forcible touching. He\u2019s accused of squeezing a woman\u2019s breast June 9 at a Midtown hotel bar and pinching another woman\u2019s butt Oct. 24, 2018, at lower Manhattan nightclub TAO.\n\nBiden landed in hot water in March after former Nevada politician Lucy Flores penned an op-ed for New York magazine, saying the former vice president and current presidential candidate made her feel \u201cgross\u201d when he grabbed her by the shoulders from behind and kissed her hair during a Las Vegas campaign event.\n\nCUBA GOODING JR. FACING NEW CHARGE AS TRIAL IS DELAYED AGAIN\n\nThree other women came forward and said that Biden had touched them inappropriately \u2014 including by giving one an Eskimo kiss and placing his hand on another\u2019s thigh. Biden, however, was never accused of groping a woman\u2019s breast or buttocks.\n\nHeller called the Manhattan DA\u2019s case against Gooding \u201cincredibly weak.\u201d Assistant DA Jenna Long said at the hearing that prosecutors would try to introduce evidence at trial from 12 other accusers to prove a pattern of abuse \u2014 although he is not charged for those alleged crimes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA judge will ultimately decide whether the 12 additional accusers\u2019 claims will be admitted at trial.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Page Six.", "description": "Cuba Gooding Jr.\u2019s\u00a0attorney tried to defend the actor from groping allegations Tuesday \u2014 by comparing the charges to\u00a0complaints leveled\u00a0at\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0for getting too handsy with a female politician.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GoodingBiden1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
