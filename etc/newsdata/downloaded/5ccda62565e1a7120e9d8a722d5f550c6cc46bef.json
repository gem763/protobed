But there is expectation that they will resume again in the future, with the US president desperate to get US forces back home before the election next year, allowing him to claim credit for ending the longest war in America\u2019s history.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMany of the candidates in the coming Afghan election, including some who would not have countenanced this happening in the past, now say the push for Taliban involvement in government is going to get stronger over the coming months and may be difficult to resist. This is likely, they say, not just because of the signals from Washington but the violent reality on the ground, with the Taliban and other Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and Isis controlling expanding swathes of territory, and war weariness from a population suffering relentless bombings and shootings.\n\nThe star attraction at the Bamiyan rally is Abdullah Abdullah, who had been co-leader of the current National Unity Government with President Ashraf Ghani and who is now his main rival at the polls.\n\nAs we fly up to Bamiyan together from Kabul on an army helicopter, Dr Abdullah, who had the title of chief executive in the administration, tells of the need to find a way to end the bloody conflict, and how power-sharing with the Taliban could be the answer.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban are a reality in the country, their forces, their supporters, their foreign connections. Everybody agrees you cannot finish this war by just fighting and killing everybody. Hopefully the Taliban see it as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe point is to move to a solution, and one I would like to have is an interim set-up. All sorts of possibilities have to be looked at, including power-sharing. Then there is a permanent solution, and that will be through elections.\n\n\u201cI think the US have done a good job, but before agreeing to a [draft] agreement they should have imposed some conditions on the Taliban. There should have been an agreement on a ceasefire. Look at how committed the people are to the election despite how dangerous it is. We cannot let down these people so we must find a solution.\u201d\n\nDr Abdullah was once a key lieutenant of the Northern Alliance Commander Ahmed Shah Masood, \u2018the Lion of Panjshir\u2019, and fought alongside him in years of bloody conflict against the Taliban.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The Americans are concerned \u2013 they think they can get troop levels down to zero \u2013 and so there is urgency to all this, and we need to take this seriously.\u201d\n\nThere are many among the people of Bamiyan who will view the Taliban regaining authority with great trepidation. The Hazara Shias of the region were the victims of a number of massacres and mass rapes at the hands of the Pashtun Sunni Islamists during the savage civil war.\n\nBamiyan province has experienced clashes between the two ethnic groups since the fall of the Taliban. Its wondrous landscape of mountains, gorges and valleys, deep green fields and turquoise lakes \u2013 and fascinating architecture from its time as a conduit of the Silk Road \u2013 have largely escaped the strife of recent years.\n\nThere has been investment in infrastructure and education and promotion of woman\u2019s rights. Four years after the Taliban were whipping women for not wearing the burqa, Habiba Sarabi in Bamiyan became Afghanistan\u2019s first female governor in 2005.\n\nBut the region has become more isolated. The roads to Kabul in the southeast are now dangerous, as are the roads to Kunduz and Mazari Sharif in the north. In the autumn of last year, the Taliban fighters began targeting Hazara residents in the central provinces of Uruzgan and Ghazni. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands displaced in the fighting which followed.\n\nResidents of Bamiyan, like those in other parts of the country, have received messages from the Taliban to keep away from election rallies during the campaign and polling stations on voting days. But a group of young students waiting to hear Dr Abdullah and the fellow speakers in his coalition, Karim Khalili and Mohammed Mohaqiq, point out they have no intention of being put off by the threats. They have come to confirm they are making the right decision when they vote in Saturday\u2019s presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first one that I have been able to vote in because of my age and I don\u2019t want to make a mistake\u201d, said Parwan Nazari, who is studying at Bamiyan University. \u201cI think I\u2019ll vote for Dr Abdullah, but I wanted to listen to him and also the others, this is a good opportunity. I will certainly be voting and so will all my friends, our families are very encouraging about this.\u201d\n\nMs Nazari and her friend, Nisa Ghaznavi, both 19, are reading English literature and both want to be journalists. \u201cI want to find out for myself what is going on rather than just depending on social media. I want to travel as well and see other places. I want to look at the future,\u201d says Ms Ghaznavi. Banen Haidari is also looking to the future, but is also deeply interested in aspects of the past. She is studying geology and architecture, and one of the key reasons for her doing so is \u201cthat\u201d, she says, pointing at the rock niches where one of the Buddhas once stood.\n\nThey are now covered in scaffolding for buttresses. \u201cBut we are hoping that work will start, and I want to be part of a team which works on rebuilding them. I have always been interested, since I was little.\u201d All the women in the group want the statues to be rebuilt, some not just to restore heritage, but in the hope it will bring in tourists. \u201cWe need the money, and it\u2019s always good to see foreign people,\u201d says Ms Ghaznavi.\n\nThe women in the group are too young to have experienced Taliban atrocities firsthand, although they have heard about them from their parents. None of them, however, object to the Taliban forming part of a future government \u2013 \u201cpeople are just tired of war\u201d, Ms Nazari says. But the friends agree with Fatima Alizada, who warns caution: \u201cWe need to make sure that the Taliban don\u2019t impose their old rules, that they respect the reforms which have been carried out.\u201d\n\nMs Alizada, 19, who is doing a course in Islamic studies and wants to be a defence lawyer, does not think the emancipation of women has gone far enough in Afghanistan. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we got one single woman running for the presidency?\u201d she wants to know.\n\nSitting in the shade of a wall, Haji Abdullah can think of no good memories of the Taliban. \u201cAll I can recall are tortures and beatings, people being jailed, men forced not to cut their beards, so no, that was a bad time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI remember when they blew up the Buddha. They had these big guns, they were firing from a long way away. I could see the statues getting hit, 18, 19 times, they just kept on firing at them. What they did was very bad.\u201d\n\nHaji Abdullah is ambivalent about the Taliban returning. \u201cWe want peace, yes, but they must accept the laws and not interfere with our lives.\u201d The 36-year-old shopkeeper is doing alright, and not hard-up financially, despite having six children. He would vote for Dr Abdullah but also wants to say Ashraf Ghani is \u201ca good man.\u201d\n\nAhmed Ali Wahdat, the owner of a carpentry business, is more forthright. \u201cYou cannot trust the Taliban. We know what they did last time, all the killings that took place, homes burnt.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to destroy. They used cannons and dynamite on the Buddhas, but even then it took them weeks \u2013 you know, those statues were so strong. And now they can be rebuilt again, so they won\u2019t stay destroyed. It\u2019s the way us Hazaras have had to be strong to survive, the way Afghanistan has had to survive. Why give all that up, bringing back the people who did this?\u201d\n\nRead the first part of the Conflict Without End series here: Afghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption; and the second part here: Afghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: \u2018My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up\u2019; and the third part here: Raid on al-Qaeda bomb factory leaves dozens of wedding-goers dead, in latest Afghan violence\u200b", "description": "One of the last rallies of the election campaign takes place under the shadow of the most internationally familiar symbol of religious intolerance in Afghanistan\u00a0\u2013 the cliffs of Bamiyan where the magnificent statues of Buddha had stood from the sixth\u00a0century\u00a0before being blown up by the Taliban.", "authors": ["Kim Sengupta"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/17/Bamiyan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
