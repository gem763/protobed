REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nCWU said more than 97% of a ballot of roughly 110,000 British postal workers were in favour of going on strike. Some 76% of its members working in Royal Mail voted in the ballot, the union said here\n\n\u201cThe prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now looms large,\u201d CWU said in a statement.\n\nRoyal Mail, which has 142,000 employees in Britain, said it was disappointed that union chose to ballot for industrial action and that it was still in mediation with the union.\n\nRoyal Mail last year reached a deal with the union over pensions, pay, a shorter working week, culture and operational changes, after nearly 10 months of negotiations. (reut.rs/35DHVio)\n\n\u201cToday the new RMG leadership are breaking that agreement,\u201d said Terry Pullinger, Deputy General Secretary (Postal) at CWU.\n\n\u201cWe would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union,\u201d said Dave Ward, General Secretary at CWU.\n\nThe company was not immediately available to comment on Pullinger\u2019s comments. The run-up to Christmas is its busiest time of the year.\n\nRoyal Mail, privatised four years ago, is one of the few big British firms still to have a defined-benefit pension scheme, which pays out a proportion of a member\u2019s final salary depending on how long employees have paid in to the scheme.\n\nBy contrast, a defined contribution scheme is a retirement plan in which the employer and employee contribute to an investment fund that is used to buy a pension on retirement.\n\nUnder a collective scheme, contributions are pooled, instead of being held in an individual account, helping to share risk.", "description": "Britain's Royal Mail staff want to go on a nationwide strike, the Communications Workers Union (CWU) said on Tuesday, after it alleged that the company failed to adhere to a pension deal signed last year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441178307&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1K6", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
