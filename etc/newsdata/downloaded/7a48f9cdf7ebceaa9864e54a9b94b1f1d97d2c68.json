Actually it was Mike\u2019s [Cannon-Brookes] idea,\u201d admits Price, who charges nothing for such consulting services and has no sales targets in his role. \u201cMike said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you just call it \u2018the sauce\u2019 and why don\u2019t we just share it? My old corporate mindset was to hoard information, but our mindset at Atlassian is that information isn\u2019t power, it is the application of information that\u2019s the power \u2026 Knowledge is worthless if you don\u2019t do anything with it.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csauce\u201d is a constantly tweaked recipe of how to make diverse teams pull in the same direction and work in the \u201cagile\u201d way of the world\u2019s most fashionable start-ups. It contains big licks of pitfalls to avoid \u2013 such as bringing in new tech without retiring the old \u2013 and comes with a pinch of salt. \u201cI can share how things work at Atlassian,\u201d Price says, \u201cbut we\u2019ve only got 15 years of doing something. We are very young.\u201d\n\nBorn in Manchester \u2013 his mum is an executive assistant, his step-dad is a technical illustrator who helps build planes for Britain\u2019s Ministry of Defence \u2013 Price moved to Australia 15 years ago. Now aged 41, he shares Cannon-Brookes\u2019 passion for making Australian business more innovative, more capable of withstanding whatever competition the global economy can throw at it.\n\nANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott adopted Atlassian's products across the whole bank as part of a workforce transformation. Vince Caligiuri\n\n\u201cI absolutely love this place, but I don\u2019t imagine that in 15 to 20 years we\u2019re going to be digging stuff out of the ground and exporting it as our main form of business,\u201d Price says. He insists that Atlassian \u201cgenuinely wants to benefit the economy\u201d, and the way he talks, you can\u2019t help but feel he genuinely believes that. As one director familiar with Atlassian\u2019s modus operandi puts it: \u201cPrice is an amazing presenter. He could sell fossil fuels.\u201d\n\nMore widely known than its germinal role in Telstra\u2019s restructure is how Atlassian has been the inspiration for much of Shayne Elliott\u2019s workforce transformation of ANZ Banking Group. That has seen so-called agile methodologies adopted across the bank, with 8000 bankers and other staff reorganised into dozens of \u201ctribes\u201d and \u201csquads\u201d based on whatever projects are most critical at any given time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe response from our non-tech teams is telling,\u201d says ANZ\u2019s chief information officer, Gerard Florian. \u201cNot surprisingly, some people start off thinking an Atlassian discussion will be all \u2018techos in T-shirts\u2019, but they realise quickly that Atlassian has much more to offer.\u201d\n\nFlorian's direct relationship with Price began when he saw a webinar posted on LinkedIn. \u201cThe value that Atlassian offers goes beyond solutions into their experience as a high-growth company,\u201d Florian says. \u201cHow they have managed this growth is a source of real insight. They think big picture about what they do \u2013 beyond the tech. They see themselves building high-performance teams, not just selling solutions \u2026 There\u2019s a lot that any CEO, board or executive could learn from this.\u201d\n\nAtlassian is a tearaway success. Having floated on the Nasdaq at $US21 in December 2015, this year, its share price eclipsed $US140. It\u2019s Australia\u2019s only home-grown tech behemoth, and because it is not in the business of harvesting data and selling it to advertisers, the Kremlin or Cambridge Analytica, it seems immune to the backlash against tech giants such as Facebook, Twitter or Google. And unlike Uber or Airbnb or WeWork, it has proven its ability to deliver steady, growing profits. Helping it fly beneath radars is the fact that most people don\u2019t know exactly what it does.\n\nAtlassian's offices in Sydney's Martin Place are a touch of Silicon Valley, with Australian accents. New York Times\n\nBut its offices \u2013 based in Sydney\u2019s Martin Place \u2013 do indeed feel like Silicon Valley, with an Aussie accent. Staff wear Atlassian T-shirts, and sometimes no shoes. There is little regard for designer office furniture, but there are a few decorating touches that speak to the idiosyncrasies of the founders. The \u201clibrary\u201d features a portrait of Cannon-Brookes as Louis XIV in his coronation robes and one of Farquhar in the style of Jacques-Louis David\u2019s painting of Napoleon crossing the alps.\n\nThe top brass of Australian companies used to read Harvard Business Review articles, or take study tours of Silicon Valley to get their heads around how big tech was reshaping the rules of business. Now they have a suitable case study to learn from, right here. Of the two founders, it is Cannon-Brookes who has more visibly injected himself into policy debates. And a lot of Australian business leaders want to be like Mike. As Power panellist and director at Lendlease and Macquarie Group, Nicola Wakefield Evans, puts it: \u201cHe\u2019s self-made. He\u2019s come out of Australia. He\u2019s humble yet he\u2019s very focused on the issues that he\u2019s pushing.\u201d\n\nIf all industry understands they have to work like the technology industry, then we\u2019ll get the country-level changes happening easier. \u2014 Mike Cannon-Brookes\n\nClad in his traditional costume of hoodie and baseball cap, Cannon-Brookes typically kicks off an ASX-company board visit with a casual \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d More often than not that leads to him taking directors on the journey of how Atlassian has grown and evolved. They tend to lean in most when he reveals the failings and mistakes, things that have gone wrong rather than right.\n\nWhy does Cannon-Brookes spend his time talking to other companies? Because, he says, it\u2019s the fastest way to change the country. \u201cBig business is a huge constituent in driving Australia forward, right?\u201d he says, with his frequent verbal tic of turning a statement into an affirmation-seeking question. \u201cIf all industry understands that they have to understand and work like the technology industry, then we\u2019ll get the larger, country-level changes happening easier.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut given much of his spiel revolves around being agile, disruption and the future of work, it could be seen, on another level, as a hell of a sophisticated sales job. Atlassian, after all, is in the business of selling software that helps people collaborate. The company\u2019s mission is \u201cto unleash the potential in every team\u201d; TEAM is the company\u2019s ticker on the Nasdaq.\n\nCannon-Brookes avers that he simply wants Australian business, and hence Australia, to get sharper, faster, fitter for the future. \u201cI don\u2019t think corporate Australia moves at the same pace that corporate America does,\u201d he says. But sure, when \u201cthe CEO knows who we are and is trying to lead a change agenda, then there\u2019s obviously a lot more detailed topical questions around how can we help them, and how they should structure their organisations, for want of a better term. Not org- structure wise, but conceptually, how they should think about working, and how we manage it differently, things like that.\u201d\n\nFor Power panellist Paul Howes, the national managing partner of KPMG Enterprises, it is Cannon-Brookes\u2019 outspokenness that gives him so much power. There is a candour in how he talks that is refreshing in the risk-averse directors\u2019 club.\n\nMike Cannon-Brookes with fund manager Hamish Douglass at the Hearts and Minds conference in Sydney. \u201cI don\u2019t think corporate Australia moves at the same pace that corporate America does,\u201d Cannon-Brookes says. Daniel Munoz\n\nPaul Bassat, co-founder of SEEK and now a venture capitalist, agrees. \u201cMike has played a really important leadership role in advocating for issues that are important,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the move of our economy towards renewable energy, passion for the tech ecosystem, the need for greater innovation, he\u2019s played a really critical role in terms of shaping the debate.\u201d\n\nAs Cannon-Brookes\u2019 standing has increased outside the tech sphere, he has had to learn to weather the adversarial side of media attention, particularly as it pertains to his vocal campaigning for Australia\u2019s transition to a renewables-based energy industry.\n\nHe publicly took on Prime Minister Scott Morrison \u2013 initially via a social media campaign \u2013 to subvert his \u201cfair dinkum power\u201d slogan, and then via a Senate inquiry submission, describing how governments must act faster to support the transition to zero-carbon emissions. Perhaps predictably, his foray into the political fray produced a furious response from some parts of the national media, with articles aimed at positioning Cannon-Brookes\u2019 stance as out of touch with Australians who are struggling to pay their power bills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard one, I won\u2019t say it doesn\u2019t matter, because it does,\u201d he says when asked about the coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, but I deeply believe that standing up for the right thing is important. Sharing one\u2019s views is important. No change in history has ever come without sceptics, but that doesn\u2019t mean the cost isn\u2019t tricky to bear at times. I\u2019m not naive enough to say it doesn\u2019t matter at all, or it doesn\u2019t affect the family, or nobody cares, but it\u2019s a challenging thing.\u201d\n\nAsked about the controversy over whether business should \u201cstick to its knitting\u201d, as Qantas chief Alan Joyce was advised when he took on the mantle of helping achieve same-sex marriage, he says Joyce is \u201ca business leader. He\u2019s a public figure, he\u2019s a fantastically smart guy, he\u2019s a very emphatic guy. And you know, he\u2019s sort of giving his point of view on where things are at, and I think we need more of that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Joyce says Cannon-Brookes is \u201ca big thinker. And he\u2019s willing to speak his mind, especially on things he\u2019s passionate about. People want business leaders to show some conviction now and then, and Mike does that in spades.\u201d\n\nChristine Holgate, Alan Joyce and Mike Cannon-Brookes at the inaugural meeting of the Nation Brand Advisory Council in Canberra in June 2018. Joyce, like Cannon-Brookes has stepped into the political fray. Sean Davey\n\nDoes Cannon-Brookes harbour any political ambitions? A person accustomed to the power of helming \u2013 together with his co-founder \u2013 a $43 billion company, would likely be loath to enter the brutal sport that is politics. But from the viewpoint of Canberra, Cannon-Brookes is seen as a true business leader, and one worth listening to. Labor MP Ed Husic likens both Farquhar and Cannon-Brookes to a modern-day Donald Horne, whose The Lucky Country shook the 1960s out its self-satisfied stupor.\n\n\u201cI see these guys as a generational representative of Australians who want the country to not just think big, but to get a sense of urgency about the need to make the big decisions that will help turn us into something more than what we are.\u201d Liberal MP Jason Falinski says he wholeheartedly supports business leaders such as Cannon-Brookes taking part in debate on climate +change, but wishes they would also talk more about issues like reforming industrial relations and reducing red tape.\n\nSome politicians bristle a bit at the prospect of a 30-something tech whiz telling them how to deal with policy problems. \u201cBut at the same time,\u201d one says, \u201cmost politicians have an inkling that their own digital literacy isn\u2019t just poor, it\u2019s holding the country back.\u201d\n\nAnd it is this frustration, at things that are holding the country back, that seems to drive Cannon-Brookes towards his extra-curricular activities. Sure, he has something to sell, but he\u2019s also selling Australia itself.\n\n\u201cThe tech world operates on pure terms; you build a faster chip, a better piece of software, you win customers. It makes it easy, right?\u201d he says, while elaborating on the point that what business ultimately wants is a level playing field.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is the older you get, you realise politics is a part of that levelling the playing field. The Australian tech industry, we\u2019ve been incredibly loud over the last series of years on immigration issues, on R &D, on education, on all sorts of different areas where we are engaging with politics. It\u2019s not because we love politics, it\u2019s quite the opposite. It\u2019s because we feel like there\u2019s a playing field that is not level, and it needs to be level on a global scene.\u201d\n\nThe AFR Magazine annual Power issue is out Friday, October 4, inside The Australian Financial Review.
