Rights Chief Calls for Investigation Into Violence as Hong Kong Reels From Escalating Protests", "language": "en", "text": "The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said Saturday that the extent of violence during Hong Kong\u2019s four months of anti-government unrest warrants an independent probe.\n\nReuters reported that Bachelet called on Hong Kong authorities to launch an \u201ceffective, prompt, independent and impartial investigation\u201d into the handling of the protests, which to date have led to more than 1,100 injuries, 31 of them sustained overnight.\n\nBachelet\u2019s remarks came as Hong Kong entered a second day of protest against a ban on the wearing of facial coverings\u2014an emergency measure to curb the unrest that has met with a disastrous reception.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, hundreds began marching through downtown Hong Kong chanting \u201cFight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!\u201d and \u201cI have the right to wear a mask!\u201d Marchers occupied major streets and almost all wore facial coverings in defiance of the ban, which applies to all public gatherings and renders violators liable to a year in jail.\n\nAlong Chater Road, beside the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, protesters unfurled massive banners reading \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d and \u201cMurderous Hong Kong Police.\u201d Protests also broke out in three areas of the Kowloon peninsula, and in the northern towns of Sheung Shui, where the storefronts of businesses with mainland Chinese connections were attacked and vandalized, and Yuen Long, where a tense standoff took place with riot police. A clash also took place at the small port of Aberdeen, on the southern side of Hong Kong Island.\n\nOf the injuries sustained in Friday\u2019s protests against the anti-mask measure, three were serious. A police officer narrowly escaped a mob that attacked him with a petrol bomb, momentarily set him alight, and attempted to seize his gun. Local media reported that a 14-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the leg\u2014the second teen to be hit with a live round in recent days. He was reportedly charged with rioting and assaulting a police officer.\n\nBarring intermittent services to the airport, the entire train network remained suspended today after multiple stations, facilities, and a train were attacked by anti-government protesters. Banks, supermarkets, shopping malls and many stores remain closed after a night of destruction that saw fires lit and shopfronts smashed.\n\nGovernment facilities such as libraries, museums, and performance venues are also shuttered and major streets were deserted. Some Twitter users reported a run on ATMs, saying they were running out of cash. Panic buying took place at the few grocery stores that were open, with shoppers queuing as long as two and a half hours for staples.\n\nProtesters also smashed scores of traffic lights overnight, causing disruptions to morning motorists. Businesses were urged to \u201cmake flexible work arrangements for staff\u201d because of the conditions.\n\nPro-democracy protesters vandalize a China Mobile Ltd. store at Sheung Shui district on October 5, 2019 in Hong Kong, China. | Anthony Kwan\u2014Getty Images More\n\nIn a taped video message broadcast Saturday afternoon in Cantonese, Hong Kong\u2019s beleaguered top official, Carrie Lam, decried what she called \u201cextremely horrifying violence.\u201d She said \u201cthe radical behavior of the masked protestors was shocking. The extent of the damage was reckless and unprecedented.\u201d\n\nAppearing less conciliatory than she has in recent addresses, she said: \u201cThe rioters\u2019 extremist behavior brought a very dark night upon Hong Kong, and caused society to be half paralyzed. Everybody is worried, concerned and scared. The government has the strongest determination to stop the violence.\u201d", "description": "Thirty-one people were injured, three of them seriously, in overnight unrest", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PdTTQZldtySz9He49l7kJg--~B/aD0yOTM4O3c9NDQxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/6ae3ac9bb006aa8c7c58cb2ffb9ad4ea", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
