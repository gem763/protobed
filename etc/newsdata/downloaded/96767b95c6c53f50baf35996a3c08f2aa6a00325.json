But this time he\u2019s ticked all the boxes and he\u2019s as good as I can have him so I can\u2019t wait for the race.\u201d\n\nNoble Boy and Victorem met in the winter over 1200m at Eagle Farm with the latter winning and putting a 2\u00bd length gap between the pair.\n\nBlowes thinks a few changes will help his horse reveres that result.\n\n\u201cThe track won\u2019t be anything like it was when we met Victorem last time. That track was extremely hard which threw things in Victorem\u2019s favour,\u201d Blowes said.\n\n\u201cHughie also knows our horse well after winning three times on him. Looking at the speed map, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a problem.\n\n\u201cEverything that has drawn outside him will be forced to go forward so we won\u2019t have too many dramas. And he\u2019ll have his chance to get out and get rolling.\n\n\u201cIf we can beat Victorem it puts us in good stead for aiming for a stronger race. To be the first horse to do the Country Championships/Kosciuszko double would be pretty special.\u201d\n\nBlowes thinks Notation is the next hardest horse to beat in the race while Graham knows her five-year-old has something the others don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s on-song I\u2019d say he does have the best turn of foot in the race,\u201d Graham said. \u201cNoble Boy is a very good horse and like most of the horses that are in the race, you can\u2019t disregard any of them.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s in the lap of the Gods now. I\u2019m very happy with my horse.\u201d\n\nThe booking of star jockey Tommy Berry only adds to Victorem\u2019s chances and he\u2019s ridden him in a trial to get a feel for the horse. They\u2019ll jump out from the ideal barrier five.\n\nGraham also has Awesome Pluck, who ran third in the race last year, lining up again and he\u2019s good value at $14.\n\n\u201cLike last year, I feel that he\u2019s going into it under the radar,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll run a super race. If he settles he\u2019ll run very well.\u201d", "description": "For quite some time now, Victorem and Noble Boy have been battling it out for favouritism for the $1.3 million The Kosciuszko (1200m) at Royal Randwick on Saturday.", "authors": ["Matt Jones"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b29a03bd2328c10a9dff569dc72cdb2a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
