That\u2019s the question hanging over the U.S. economy amid fresh evidence the once-hot labor market is losing steam.\n\nNonfarm payrolls expanded by 136,000 in September, according to a Labor Department report Friday that missed the median estimate of economists. That brought the average gain this year to 161,000, compared with 223,000 throughout 2018. On top of that, average hourly earnings rose 2.9% from a year earlier, the weakest rate since mid-2018.\n\nYet the unemployment rate declined to a fresh half-century low of 3.5%, with the pace of hiring remaining above what\u2019s needed to accommodate population growth. And pay for production and nonsupervisory workers held up better than the overall numbers.\n\nMarkets appeared to take the report as a sign growth would hold up. Traders of fed funds futures slightly reduced the amount of easing they expect from the U.S. central bank this year and marginally trimmed their expectations for a third straight rate cut this month. U.S. stocks rose though the Treasury yield curve flattened and the dollar remained lower.\n\nRead more: Fed Likely to View Payrolls as Showing Less Urgency to Move\n\n\u201cThe picture is complicated,\u201d said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse Group AG. The labor market is slowing, but there are \u201cno signs that we\u2019re suddenly falling into a recession or something like that.\u201d\n\nWages and employment are still relatively solid. But risks continue to hang over the world\u2019s largest economy, including President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policy and weakness abroad, while the effect of last year\u2019s tax cuts keeps wearing off. Trump took the chance to boast about the jobless rate on Twitter, but manufacturing jobs declined for the second time this year.\n\nFriday\u2019s report caps a week of U.S. economic data that whipsawed stocks and sent already-low Treasury yields tumbling, led by a key manufacturing gauge that sank deeper into contraction with the worst reading in a decade. A slowdown also threatens Trump\u2019s re-election prospects next year, with the president frequently staking his message on a strong economy.\n\nRead more: Dodge a Major Global Slowdown? A Lot Needs to Go Right\n\nThe data offer a contrast with characterizations by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues at recent meetings that job gains have been \u201csolid,\u2019\u2019 though they may still have room to stick with that assessment. Late Thursday, Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said the economy remains on solid footing and recession risks aren\u2019t \u201cparticularly elevated under appropriate monetary policy.\u201d\n\nPowell is scheduled to deliver opening remarks at 2 p.m. in Washington at a Fed event, followed by comments from governors Lael Brainard and Randal Quarles.\n\n\u201cThis is a muddled middle sort of report,\u201d Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz SE, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. \u201cIt\u2019s not weak enough to confirm that weakness is spreading from global manufacturing throughout the economy, but not strong enough to suggest that we are immune.\u201d El-Erian is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\nThe muted factory-recession impact evident in the latest jobs data is testament to the resilience of economic growth at present. This is wholly consistent with Bloomberg Economics\u2019 assessment that growth will slow below 2% in the back half of the year, while recession risk remains low.-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Andrew HusbyClick here for the full note.\n\nRevisions were a bright spot, adding 45,000 jobs for the prior two months, though the three-month average still fell to 157,000 from 171,000.\n\nThe job gains were concentrated in health care and professional and business services. Retail employment contracted for an eighth-straight month, while construction payroll growth remained tepid.\n\nManufacturers subtracted 2,000 jobs, continuing a trend toward weaker growth and damping one of Trump\u2019s key campaign messages. It likely reflects the slowdown at factories, seen also in data from the Institute for Supply Management, which points to slower production and orders amid weakening demand for goods.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
