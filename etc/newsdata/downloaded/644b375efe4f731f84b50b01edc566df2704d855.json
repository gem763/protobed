Public broadcaster NHK, which has consistently cited higher figures for the dead from Hagibis, on Tuesday placed the toll at 68. Kyodo News, citing information gathered from local authorities, reports that at least 19 people were still missing.\n\nThe country's infrastructure ministry said embankment collapses affecting 47 rivers in 66 locations had been confirmed as of Tuesday, but officials said they still don't have a complete picture of the damage.\n\nAbout 34,000 homes were without electricity and 110,000 were without running water, the government said. More than 30,000 people were still in shelters as of late Monday.\n\nIn hard-hit Nagano, on the main island of Honshu, rainfall hit a record of 134.5 millimeters (5.3 inches) in a 24-hour period.\n\nSixty-eight-year-old resident Mayumi Shibata temporarily returned to her flooded home on Monday.\n\n\"I can't believe that something like this actually happened,\" she told Mainichi Shimbun.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, Shibata's husband took his 97-year-old mother to a local evacuation shelter in Nagano, but she chose to stay behind thinking that the flooding wouldn't be too serious.\n\n\"I have a cat, so I thought if I took it to the evacuation shelter, it would cause trouble to other evacuees,\" she told Mainichi.\n\nShe sent her husband worried messages by phone as the water kept rising through the night. She was eventually rescued from an upper floor.\n\nWhen Toshitaka Yoshimura, a retired carpenter in Nagano, returned to his home after staying at an evacuation center during the storm, he was stunned by what he saw, according to The Associated Press.\n\nHis house was a muddy mess, with doors knocked out and furniture tossed about and covered in dirt.\n\n\"I put a lot of effort in this house,\" Yoshimura said. \"I made all the furniture with my wife. Now look what happened in one day,\" he said. \"Now this makes me want to cry.\"", "description": "The government says the death toll from Typhoon Hagibis, which struck over the weekend, was at least 53.
