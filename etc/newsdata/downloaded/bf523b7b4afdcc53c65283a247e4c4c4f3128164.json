WeWork\u2019s board this week was also weighing a buyout from JPMorgan, Business Insider reported.\n\nSoftBank\u2019s buyout values the company at $8 billion, down from the $47 billion valuation it gave the company earlier this year. As part of the deal, Neumann is expected to sell nearly $1 billion worth of stock to SoftBank and receive $500 million in credit as well as a $185 million \u201cconsulting fee,\u201d according to The Journal.\n\nA WeWork representative was not immediately available to comment.\n\nHere are the key takeaways from experts who spoke with Business Insider about the deal.\n\nExperts think SoftBank was right to take WeWork away from Neumann but are surprised by how much money he got from the deal\n\nSeparating Neumann from the future of WeWork was largely seen as the right move for SoftBank.\n\n\u201cSoftBank needed to do this to optimize their chances of recouping their initial investment on top of their new additional investment,\u201d said Loren Trimble, the CEO of AArete, a global consulting firm. \u201cAnytime anyone gets an offer for [$1.7 billion] from a company with such financial uncertainty, where it could potentially run out of cash in the next 30 to 40 days, should feel fortunate.\u201d\n\nThe sheer amount of money SoftBank is said to be giving Neumann struck multiple experts as surprising.\n\n\u201cI think anything over a dollar was more than they needed to pay,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cWhat it proves is Neumann\u2019s mastery at sophisticated negotiation, when in reality he had very little cards. What occurred was shameful, for him to have gotten anything.\u201d\n\nNir Kossovsky, the CEO of Steel City Re, a risk-management firm, said that while severing ties with Neumann was the right move for the future of WeWork, the size of Neumann\u2019s \u201cgolden parachute\u201d could reflect poorly on SoftBank\u2019s reputation.\n\n\u201cWeWork and SoftBank and perhaps even JPMorgan are in some level of a reputational crisis right now,\u201d Kossovsky said. \u201cReputation risk can often be mitigated by sacrificing an executive or a board member \u2026 but throwing him overboard with a golden parachute does deliver a mixed message.\u201d\n\nLegal experts say a shareholder lawsuit against WeWork seems unlikely\n\nMinor Myers, a professor at the University of Connecticut Law School specializing in corporate finance, said WeWork was unlikely to see a shareholder lawsuit, even if shareholders have good reason to be upset about how much money Neumann walked away with.\n\n\u201cThe existing group of stockholders is employees and sophisticated investors,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThese are people who are generally reluctant to bring lawsuits, because you have to say, \u2018Hey, you tricked me,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t make you look particularly sophisticated.\u201d\n\nCharles Korsmo, a professor of corporate law at Case Western Reserve, said he didn\u2019t expect a shareholder lawsuit either.\n\nShareholders \u201care getting the opportunity to sell into SoftBank\u2019s tender offer, so they are probably feeling better than they were yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cThe WeWork shareholders themselves are primarily sophisticated parties who would likely be embarrassed to sue claiming they had been bamboozled.\u201d\n\nBut experts agree that shareholders have good reason to be upset at the deal\n\nMyers noted that WeWork\u2019s S-1 filing said Neumann was integral to the company\u2019s success, which could have made his departure a liability \u2013 but since the company never went public, those claims aren\u2019t grounds for a suit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason to be upset with SoftBank,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIf you think there\u2019s a problem with Adam Neumann, why didn\u2019t you do this before?\u201d\n\nKorsmo predicted that SoftBank, which has sunk more than $10 billion into WeWork already, would face shareholder ire.\n\n\u201cIf anyone has reason for feeling aggrieved, it is the public shareholders of SoftBank, which appears to be throwing good money after bad,\u201d Korsmo said.", "description": "Business Insider - Experts largely agreed that SoftBank made the right move by buying out Adam Neumann but were shocked by the price of his golden parachute..
