Neil Greenberg of the Washington Post reported in October 2018 teams were going for two 11 percent of the time through the first five weeks, up 3 percent from 2017.\n\nThe NFL has made it more enticing to go for two since kicking an extra point requires a kicker to make a 32-yard field goal, as Greenberg wrote:\n\n\"For example, if teams are successful kicking an extra-point 95 percent of the time\u2014the average rate since 2015, when the league moved the snap for the extra-point kick to the 15-yard line\u2014they will score 0.95 points per kick attempt. That means a two-point conversion needs only a 47.5 percent success rate to give a comparable point per attempt.\"\n\nBelichick doesn't seem interested in using analytics in that regard, though he's hardly alone. The Patriots are one of 18 teams that have yet to attempt a two-point conversion in 2019.\n\nReiss noted New England's use of data tends to be more on the football operations side, including technology, scouting and contracts.\n\nConsidering the Patriots have won six Super Bowls since 2001 and look like a serious contender for a seventh this season, Belichick's data usage seems to be working, and there's no reason for him to change his approach now.", "description": "The rise of analytics across the  NFL  hasn't had any impact on what  New England Patriots  head coach  Bill Belichick  does.
