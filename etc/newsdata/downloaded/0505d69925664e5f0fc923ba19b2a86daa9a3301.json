Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year.\n\nBritain\u2019s medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines \u2013 a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150mg and 300mg dosages \u2013 over an potential carcinogen called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)\n\nOver-the-counter 75mg dosage Zantac products are produced by a different company and are not affected by the recall, it added.\n\n\u201cGSK informed the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] of our decision to suspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms of Zantac products,\u201d a company spokesman confirmed to Reuters.\n\nJohnson & Johnson signals climbdown ahead of major opioids crisis test case Read more\n\nGSK was continuing with investigations into the potential source of the NDMA, he said.\n\nThe impurity was believed to have been introduced by changes in the manufacturing process.\n\nThe MHRA said healthcare professionals were told on Monday to stop supplying the products immediately, quarantine all remaining stock and return it to their supplier.\n\n\u201cWe are advising that patients should not to stop taking their medication, and do not need to see their doctor until their next routine appointment but should seek their doctor\u2019s advice if they have any concerns,\u201d the MHRA said.\n\nUS and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, after online pharmacy Valisure flagged the impurities.\n\nThe FDA said Valisure\u2019s higher-temperature testing method generated very high levels of NDMA from the ranitidine drugs.\n\nNDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs.\n\nThe US regulator has asked ranitidine makers to conduct their own testing to assess levels of the impurity and to send samples of their products for testing by the agency.\n\nSwiss drugmaker Novartis halted global distribution of its ranitidine drugs last month.\n\nLast week, Walmart joined pharmacy chains CVS Health Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp in suspending the sale of over-the-counter heartburn drugs containing ranitidine.\n\nCanada\u2019s health authorities have asked makers of the drugs to halt distribution as they gather more information. Last month, regulators in Hong Kong pulled four products, while in Ireland 13 products containing ranitidine were recalled.", "description": "Heartburn medicine pulled by GlaxoSmithKline while it investigates source of impurity", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469eb4ab75d6cf85daec99d570e61b37b4c396a8/434_287_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94da8c92ebefb493e6b3a566546f158d", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
