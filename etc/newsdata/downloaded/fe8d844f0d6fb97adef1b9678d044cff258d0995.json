The top U.S. firm identified in the report was International Business Machines Corp. , which sold surveillance technology in 11 countries. IBM provides governments with so-called smart-cities technology to monitor a city and analyze data.\n\nIBM and Huawei didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.\n\nDefenders of facial recognition and other surveillance tools note how they can be used for good, protecting citizens from terrorist attacks and other threats.\n\n\u201cChina is exporting surveillance tech to liberal democracies as much as it is targeting authoritarian markets,\u201d showing how democracies are exporting it and using it as well as authoritarian regimes, wrote report author Steven Feldstein, now an associate professor at Boise State University. \u201cLikewise, companies based in liberal democracies\u2026are actively selling sophisticated equipment.\u201d\n\nWSJ's Jason Bellini talks to Real Networks CEO Robert Glaser about his company's facial recognition technology that is being used in schools and retail stores. The surprise? Glaser himself has privacy concerns and is calling for regulation of the technology.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Should the U.S. regulate the use of facial recognition technology for surveillance use? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe report relies on Mr. Feldstein\u2019s review of news reports and other information from 176 countries, which he posted in a publicly available database. The survey included countries, cities and other governments as well as quasi-public entities such as airports.\n\nHe counted 64 countries where government entities have purchased facial-recognition technology that uses cameras and photo databases; 56 countries where authorities have used \u201csmart cities\u201d technology, such as sensors and body cameras that collect information analyzed at a command center; and 53 countries where authorities are using \u201csmart policing\u201d systems that analyze data and make predictions about future crimes.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that there is ample time to initiate a much-needed public debate about the proper balance between AI technology, government surveillance, and the privacy rights of citizens,\u201d writes Mr. Feldstein. \u201cBut as these technologies become more embedded in governance and politics, the window for change will narrow.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com", "description": "China leads the world in facial-recognition and other new surveillance technologies, according to a new report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.", "authors": ["Ryan Tracy", "Ryan.Tracy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107639/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
