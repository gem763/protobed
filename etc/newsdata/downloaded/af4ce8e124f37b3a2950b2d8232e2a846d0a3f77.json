Trump reversed this policy in an executive order in which he declared that the statutory deportation grounds apply to all removable aliens.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBorder wall\n\nThe Democrats prevented Trump from getting the funds he needs for his border security measures, such as a border wall.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency and reallocated funds from military construction projects to build walls at strategic locations along the border.\n\nA federal court issued a temporary injunction to prevent him from using funds appropriated for other purposes to construct a border wall.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court lifted that injunction, allowing Trump to continue construction while the lower courts review the merits of the objection to using the funds for that purpose. This indicates that the Court thinks it is likely that Trump will prevail on the merits of the suit.\n\nInterim Final Rule (IFR)\n\nThe IFR makes aliens ineligible for asylum in the United States if they have not sought protection from persecution from the countries they traveled through en route to the United States.\n\nA district court in California issued a preliminary, nationwide injunction blocking the implementation of the IFR while a lawsuit challenging its legality moves forward. The Supreme Court lifted that injunction and permitted Trump to continue with the implementation of the IFR pending the outcome of the lawsuit.\n\nMigrant Protection Protocols (MPP)\n\nThe MPP provides that aliens attempting to enter the U.S. from Mexico without proper documentation may be returned to Mexico to wait outside of the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. Mexico has agreed to provide them with humanitarian protections.\n\nThere have been legal challenges, but the Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can implement the MPP while it faces the challenges. As of Sept. 9, 2019, DHS had returned 42,000 migrants to Mexico under the MPP.\n\nFailures\n\nThe Flores Settlement Agreement (FSA)\n\nThe FSA prohibits the detention of children for more than 20 days. All Hell broke loose when this forced Trump to separate children from parents who were being prosecuted for making an illegal entry pursuant to a zero-tolerance enforcement policy that was intended to reduce such entries.\n\nThis forced Trump to release detained adults who have children with them when he releases their children. This \u201ccatch and release\u201d practice became a powerful pull factor that resulted in a big increase in illegal crossings with children.\n\nBetween October 2018 and August 2019, the border patrol apprehended 457,871 aliens who made an illegal crossing with a child.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump proposed a regulation that would establish high standards of care to make it possible to detain children without violating the main objective of the agreement, which was to ensure appropriate care.\n\nHowever, a California district court issued a permanent injunction preventing Trump from implementing it.\n\nImmigration court backlog crisis\n\nThe backlog of the 442-judge immigration court was 542,411 cases when Trump began his presidency. By the end of August 2019, the backlog had reached 1,007,155 cases, with an average wait for a hearing of 696 days. This makes it impossible to put newly apprehended aliens in removal proceedings without moving someone else out of line who is already scheduled for a hearing.\n\nEven with no new cases, it would take almost five years to clear the backlog.\n\nExpedited Removal Proceedings\n\nAliens in expedited removal proceedings are removed summarily unless they have a credible fear of persecution, which entitles them to an asylum hearing before an immigration judge.\n\nPrevious administrations limited expedited removal to aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the border within 14 days of making an illegal entry. DHS has announced an expansion of expedited removal to the full extent authorized by law, which means that it will apply to aliens who were not admitted or paroled into the United States who have been here less than two years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdvocacy groups challenged the expansion, arguing that the announcement violated the Administrative Procedure Act because DHS had failed to comply with notice-and-comment procedures. A federal district court granted a preliminary injunction, blocking the expansion pending the outcome of that lawsuit.\n\nThe Score\n\nTrump has been able to implement most of his immigration measures, but the delays his opponents have caused by withholding funding and fighting every measure in court have prevented him from achieving his objectives.\n\nWhen his term ends, the border will still be open, and an unmanageable immigration court backlog will still prevent meaningful interior enforcement.\n\nNolan Rappaport was detailed to the House Judiciary Committee as an executive branch immigration law expert for three years.
