No identification has been made at this time.\"\n\nIsrael, whose birth name is Ajibola Shogbamimu, killed Ms Morgan after they met through a church group and spent time alone together in violation of its rules.\n\nThe married 40-year-old claimed he dropped Ms Morgan off at her student accommodation in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, after a celebratory dinner at the American-founded Israel United in Christ church on Boxing Day.\n\nIsrael claimed he left Ms Morgan safe and well but she has not been seen since that date or used her bank accounts, and prosecutors said the laptop, prepared food and class agenda left in her room indicated that her \u201clife was cruelly cut short\u201d.\n\nSentencing the married father to life imprisonment with a minimum of 17 years, Judge Michael Soole condemned his \u201ccruel and cowardly silence about Joy Morgan\u2019s final resting place\u201d.\n\nSpeaking outside court, Ms Morgan\u2019s mother Carol pleaded with Israel to reveal the location of the body.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If I get to see her before I die I\u2019ll be very grateful.\u201d\n\nThe court heard that after killing Ms Morgan, Israel attempted to cover his tracks by removing her number from a church group chat to suggest she had left the congregation, and appearing to check on her by visiting her student accommodation after the disappearance.\n\nA signal from the victim\u2019s phone, which has never been found, was detected in Israel\u2019s car in the Stevenage area on 28 December, at which point the jury was told he was most likely \u201clooking for somewhere to dispose of the body\u201d.\n\nThe keys to her accommodation were also discovered in the footwell of his car.\n\nGPS data from Israel\u2019s car shows he was around Ms Morgan\u2019s house at the time of the unusual phone activity, before he drove to Stevenage and returned her phone to Hatfield more than two hours later.\n\nWhen asked why he had spent so long in Stevenage, he told the police that he had taken a wrong turn and became lost.\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s case was that Israel had killed Ms Morgan and had in all likelihood driven her body to Stevenage.\n\nIsrael was a senior member of the Israel United in Christ congregation in Ilford, and previously ferried Ms Morgan to and from services with his wife.\n\nHe admitted spending two nights alone with the University of Hertfordshire student in his Cricklewood flat, but denied they had sex and claimed he initially lied because the church banned women from being alone with men other than their husbands.\n\nFounded in America in 2003, the Israel United in Christ group preaches that \u201cblacks and Hispanics must learn the truth that they are the Biblical 12 tribes of the nation of Israel\u201d, and tells people to \u201crepent\u201d and obey a fundamentalist interpretation of Christianity.", "description": "Police are investigating whether human remains found in woodland could be those of a murdered student midwife.
