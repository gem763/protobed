It\u2019s painful to watch large declines in stocks, yet nobody wants to miss out on a potential 10-bagger either. When the market rewards, and penalizes, all cloud software stocks equally, with little differentiation, it\u2019s prudent to choose a select group that has compelling stories for a buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nAn investing adage is to buy when others are fearful. I would say to buy when others can\u2019t differentiate among companies. Clearly, from what we saw over the past two weeks, a broad range of companies are being lumped together, with little recognition as to which are the winners.\n\nTo put it simply, this is a great time to know what you own as the story for these stocks is much deeper than the simple descriptor of \u201ccloud software.\u201d\n\nIn the graphic above, the orange line represents the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYY, +1.40% which holds about 60 positions, all of which dominate the cloud space. The light-blue line is the Consumer Staples Select Sector ETF XLP, +0.36%, which tracks the consumer staples sector, a group that\u2019s thought to be impervious to recessions. Those have historically been the laggards in this long, growth-driven bull market. The dark purple line is the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, +0.72%.\n\nBefore the stock market correction in May, cloud stocks were the leader in the market, while the staples were trailing. However, since that first correction, and up till today, there\u2019s been a reversal. Over the past week high-growth leaders in this bull market, mostly cloud, have taken big hits.\n\nFor example:\n\nWorkday WDAY, -0.76% is down 25% from its high. Twilio TWLO, -0.26%, down 26%. Okta OKTA, -0.60%, down 22%. Zoom ZM, +0.45%, down 27%. MongoDB MDB, +1.21%, down 29%. PagerDuty PD, +14.64%, down 47%. (All prices are current as of 2 p.m. Eastern time Sept. 11.)\n\nCloud software categories\n\nTo start, cloud software needs to be broken up into categories to look more closely at the markets they serve. Here are some examples:\n\n\u2022 Twilio is at the intersection of communications and mobile.\n\n\u2022 CrowdStrike CRWD, -3.55% and Okta are security companies.\n\n\u2022 PagerDuty simplifies operations, and Workday simplifies human resources and the finance department.\n\n\u2022 Alteryx AYX, -0.95% and Splunk SPLK, +1.05% are big data analytics.\n\n\u2022 Salesforce CRM, +2.97% is customer relationship management (CRM), but the market it serves is the sales and marketing industry.\n\n\u2022 Zoom simplifies communications for enterprises and business-to-business (B2B), as does Slack WORK, -5.61%.\n\n\u2022 Veeva Systems VEEV, -1.45% serves the life sciences and pharmaceutical industry.\n\nTwilio has more in common with Skype, and even Verizon VZ, +0.70% and AT&T T, +3.09%, than it does with Okta. Workday has more in common with SAP and Oracle ORCL, +1.48% than it does with Alteryx. Yet, cloud stocks experienced a categorical black swan as if they all serve the same markets.\n\nWhat this means is that some investors don\u2019t understand these companies. The viability of a company\u2019s product and how it fits the market is not factored into the investments, and this is creating a window of opportunity for investors who take the time to study individual stocks.\n\nValuations\n\nThe more logical explanation is that there was a clearance sale for overpriced stocks, and the common denominator in the sell-off was high valuations. However, the issue with this theory is that some of the companies will go on to be big winners, and higher price-to-sales (P/S) or enterprise-value-to-sales (EV/S) ratios are warranted because of the enormous markets they serve in contrast with their small size.\n\nFor instance, Zoom\u2019s P/S and EV/S are gut-wrenching (no argument there), but the company\u2019s revenue growth is unusual. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find triple-digit revenue growth for eight straight quarters in the stock market. The prospects of disrupting Cisco and other enterprise telecommunications at a $22 billion market cap is worth more than other companies that are serving smaller, more saturated markets. Zoom\u2019s rapid growth, which is unprecedented, makes it hard to pinpoint a fair valuation.\n\nWorkday is another example of a company that carries high P/S and EV/S ratios, in this case twice as high as its large competitors, Oracle and SAP. In this scenario, you get a pure-play option that is moving quickly on machine learning to reduce the overhead required in human resources and finance departments. What Workday\u2019s software aims to do, which is to reduce the number of employees needed in those departments, delivers a value that is worth many times over the cost of the software. If Workday is successful, the company will be worth much more than two times its current market cap, whereas, Oracle and SAP are essentially defending territory.\n\nSee: Beth Kindig runs a forum on tech stocks where she answers readers\u2019 questions.\n\nSplunk has P/S and EV/S ratios of eight compared with Alteryx\u2019s 24 and 22, respectively, yet both were affected by the sell-off despite being in similar markets. Splunk should have held steady if this was a clearance sale on high valuations.\n\nThe evidence doesn\u2019t point to a rational reason for the sell-offs. Some stocks are priced high, but knowing which ones deserve to be is going to be more important than ever.\n\nHow to evaluate cloud software\n\n\u2022 The larger the market, the safer the investment. Can every enterprise employee in the world use the product for maximum scale? Does the product solve a pain and reduce overhead for businesses? These will outlast the more niche markets and products that are considered a convenience. To illustrate, if you are providing software for office communications that replaces office telecom equipment, not only is your product a necessity but it will be the solution to high telecom bills during a time when costs are being cut. There are numerous examples of fulfilling a (non-negotiable) necessity while reducing costs in the cloud software category.\n\n\u2022 Ignore earnings estimates. Many estimates were lowered this past year, and when companies \u201cbeat\u201d earnings estimates, they were actually declining year-over-year, sometimes substantially. Apple AAPL, +3.18% is a prime example of this. The stock continues to reach all-time highs and \u201cbeat earnings\u201d despite two straight quarters of negative growth and mere 1% growth in the most recent quarter. That may work for Apple, but smaller-cap companies that are declining won\u2019t last long, especially in a value rotation. Another example is Okta, which I believe had weakening fundamentals yet beat earnings estimates. Okta is now one of the hardest-hit cloud software stocks over the past two weeks, with a 22% drop since the end of August.\n\n\u2022 We hear a lot about competitive moats, yet high switching costs is a protective buffer that serves two purposes: It locks in subscription revenue and staves off competitors. Often, switching from a cloud software provider will cost a customer time and resources. Look for companies that have high switching costs.\n\nMy prediction is this may be one of the last cycles when tech is considered less safe than value stocks. As the market will find out (the hard way), cloud software is actually very safe. It is insulated from trade wars and overseas manufacturing issues. It reduces costs for enterprises, which is ideal for a recession. Lastly, cloud software is at the beginning of a rapid growth cycle compared to its counterparts in tech \u2014 such as mobile, e-commerce and advertising \u2014 which are reaching saturation, are finding themselves in the cross hairs of anti-trust and are susceptible to consumer spending changes.\n\nThe best companies in the category of \u201ccloud software\u201d will continue to post rapid growth regardless of economic conditions, and the investors who run from this sector will suffer bigger losses from missed opportunities than investors who know their winners.\n\nDisclosure: Subscribers to Beth Kindig\u2019s premium service may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.
