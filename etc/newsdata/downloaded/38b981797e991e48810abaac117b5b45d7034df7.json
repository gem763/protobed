But will Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side be able to best Barcelona and Manchester City, two excellent sides who will this year seemingly covet this competition more than any other.\n\nThe Champions League is an increasingly open competition and this year\u2019s edition may well be shaped by the marksmen each side possesses. It is a fine time for striking, and it could be a hotly contested battle for top scorer bragging rights.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

The Champions League offers a great platform for young players and newly-constructed teams \u2013 who could emerge as this year\u2019s breakout stars and surprise packages?\n\nThe Independent\u2018s team of football writers have answered all of these intriguing queries and questions below:\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Power rankings: Champions League group stage 1/33 Champions League Group Stage Power Rankings All 32 teams ranked from those with the worst chances of winning it all to those with the best. Getty Images 2/33 32. Club Brugges Squeaked past Champions League minnows LASK in qualifying. Likely to find it difficult on this, the biggest stage. Getty 3/33 31. Dinamo Zagreb Passionately supported, but it is tough to forecast a Croatia 2018 style fairytale run. AFP/Getty Images 4/33 30. Slavia Prague Beat Cluj to win their place in the group stage and made life difficult for Chelsea in the Europa League last season. Getty 5/33 29. Olympiacos Stormed past FC Krasnodar in the Play-off round, but that might be the height of their Champions League efforts this season AFP/Getty Images 6/33 28. Genk Surprise Belgian champions last season, but may struggle to step up. Gheorghe Hagi never won the Champions League as a player, but I doubt son Ianis will right his father's wrongs in his first season in Belgium. AFP/Getty Images 7/33 27. Lokomotiv Moscow Some canny additions with plenty of European experience to complement a strong Russian base, but not enough top-end quality to predict progression. Getty Images 8/33 26. Galatasaray Jean Michael Seri and Ryan Babel have joined the Turkish champions, which bodes well after Fulham's efforts last season, even if Babel was something of a find. Europa League a realistic target. AFP/Getty Images 9/33 25. Red Star Belgrade The Serbian side will be bothersome at home, and have just installed a tank outside their ground for extra intimidation points, as they were last year, when they beat Liverpool. Lack true forward quality, though. Getty Images 10/33 24. FC Salzburg Austrian champions in each of the last six seasons, which counts for something. Not much, mind you, hence the low ranking. Getty Images 11/33 23. Atalanta Punched well above their weight as the surprise Serie A packages last season, but they may struggle more at this level. Getty Images 12/33 22. Shakhtar Donetsk A faded force from the heady Uefa Cup winning days, but they remain an entertaining Brazilian/Ukranian ying and yang. They'll have at least one 5-4 result, or something along those lines. AFP/Getty Images 13/33 21. Benfica Benfica remain extremely talented despite the departure of Joao Felix, but the hardened centre that is required for Champions League success isn't quite there. AFP/Getty Images 14/33 20. Lille An odd mishmash of forgotten faces (Jose Fonte, Loic Remy) and potential stars (Timothy Weah, Renato Sanches, Jonathan Bamba) but that might be to their detriment. Boom or bust. AFP/Getty Images 15/33 19. Zenit St Petersburg Ever a tricky trip, Zenit have a sneakily fun squad. Malcom will look to rebound from his torrid time at Barcelona. Getty Images 16/33 18. Valencia Europa League semi-finalists after dropping down last season, the squad is a coherent one with experience. Round of 16 likely if they get a friendly group draw. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/33 17. Lyon More impressive in the Champions League than Ligue 1 last season, in many ways. Gone are Tanguy Ndombele, Ferland Mendy and Nabil Fekir, however - a tough ask to replace such quality. AFP/Getty Images 18/33 16. Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix. Bongarts/Getty Images 19/33 15. Chelsea Untested manager, untested squad, and lost their only true attacking difference-maker in the summer. The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage. AFP/Getty Images 23/33 11. Inter Milan Antonio Conte is a shrewd appointment who will drill his side well defensively, and Romelu Lukaku is a proven goalscorer, scoff as you might. Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nMiguel Delaney, Chief Football Writer\n\nWinner: Barcelona - they\u2019ve had the worst possible eliminations the last two years, when they\u2019ve arguably been the best team. They still have by far the best player, in Leo Messi, and I think that will eventually tell as it all comes together.\n\nTop scorer: Leo Messi \u2013 this kind of depends on who goes furthest, and well...\n\nBreakout player: Carel Eiting \u2013 everybody will again be looking to see what Ajax\u2019s produce, and they may have already produced Frenkie De Jong\u2019s successor in midfield.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City. They should really win it this season, and they will get close.\n\nSurprise package: Atalanta \u2013 play the sort of inventive football that will see Pep Guardiola talk them up before their meeting, and it could see them rip a few teams up.\n\nJonathan Liew\u200b, Chief Sports Writer\n\nWinner: \u201cThe Champions League: that\u2019s your goal now,\u201d Vincent Kompany told his Manchester City team-mates on leaving the club over the summer. And with the caveat that this is a cup competition and therefore liable to extremely strange occurrences, City remain the best bet, by virtue of being the best and most complete team.\n\nTop scorer: Mohamed Salah. The knockout stages are where you make your name, but the group stages are where you fill your boots, and Salah could well get enough goals in four games against Salzburg and Genk to end this contest by Christmas.\n\nBreakout player: Joao Felix. One of those players who\u2019s actually good enough to justify the hype.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City.\n\nSurprise package: I\u2019m going to go for plucky minnows Bayern Munich. A lot of big names out of the door over the summer, but paradoxically this feels like a tighter, more balanced squad as a result, full of players with a point to prove.\n\nMark Critchley\u200b, Northern Football Correspondent\n\nWinner: Manchester City. The best team in Europe over the last two years, if far from the best in European competition. Pep Guardiola will publicly play down any suggestion that the Champions League is the be-all and end-all for City, but don\u2019t listen. He knows he needs to win it.\n\nTop scorer: Lionel Messi. Double figures is usually enough. Ronaldo\u2019s waned a little at club level this calendar year, Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero will be prone to rotation in the group stages, while Liverpool\u2019s attack share the goals around. Messi\u2019s yet to play for Barcelona due to injury but it is still hard to look past him.\n\nBreakout player: Erling Braut Haland. Son of Alf-Inge, you may remember him scoring nine goals in one game at the Under-20 World Cup in May. He has 14 in eight for RB Salzburg, who are the dark horses in Liverpool\u2019s group.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City, by dent of winning it. Liverpool\u2019s focus is on the league but they will reach at least the quarter-finals, as will Tottenham. Chelsea to fall in the last-16.\n\nSurprise package: RB Leipzig. Currently leading the Bundesliga under new manager Julian Nagelsmann and find themselves in the evenly-balanced Group G. Could easily take top spot and get a favourable knockout tie, though an Ajax-like run may be a stretch.\n\nBen Burrows, Sports Editor\n\nWinner: Barcelona. I can\u2019t imagine Lionel Messi not winning at least one more before he\u2019s done and with Frenkie De Jong and Antoine Griezmann now on board let\u2019s say he gets it this year.\n\nTop scorer: Lionel Messi. If I believe Barca are finally going to get over the hump then it\u2019s a fair bet the little genius will have plenty to do with it.\n\nBreakout player: Ansu Fati. He\u2019s already exploded on to the scene domestically but there\u2019s no reason to believe he can\u2019t impress equally on the European stage.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City. Pep Guardiola is desperate to crown his legacy in England with another European crown and his focus on the competition this year should see them the last ones standing.\n\nSurprise package: Inter Milan. They\u2019ve been dormant for too long but with a motivated Antonio Conte and a fit and firing Romelu Lukaku in tandem one of Europe\u2019s sleeping giants should give Barca and Dortmund a run for their money in Group F. If they can get into the last 16, watch out.\n\nJack Rathborn\u200b, Sports Reporter\n\nWinner: Juventus \u2013 Cristiano Ronaldo appears as relentless as ever and despite a summer of upheaval and failing to find the right combination yet, all the pieces are there and Maurizio Sarri\u2019s European success last year shows he\u2019ll do what\u2019s required to capitalise once they arrive in the final stages.\n\nTop scorer: Raheem Sterling \u2013 he\u2019s added a lethal aspect to his game now and City have an enticing group.\n\nBreakout player: Stefano Sensi \u2013 Perhaps Italy\u2019s next great midfielder capable of running a game, will be fundamental to Inter\u2019s hopes of escaping a tough group.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City.\n\nSurprise package: Atalanta \u2013 Retained the core of last season\u2019s squad, one of Italy\u2019s most entertaining sides can defy logic again to win the battle to join Man City in the last 16.\n\nHarry Latham-Coyle\u200b\n\nWinner: Barcelona. The additions of Antoine Griezmann and Frenkie de Jong can push Barcelona on to another level and Lionel Messi\u2019s furious pursuit of another Champions League will finally bear fruit.\n\nTop Scorer: Sergio Aguero. Manchester City are in a weak group, with Shakhtar Donetsk, Dinamo Zagreb and Atalanta all eminently beatable, and, more pertinently, extremely capable of shipping a few goals. Aguero will profit.\n\nBreakout player: Lisandro Martinez. Ajax fans are (quite rightly) rather excited about their versatile young Argentine, who has the skillset to replace either Frenkie de Jong or Matthijs de Ligt and replicate their break through campaigns from last season.\n\nFurthest English club: Manchester City\n\nSurprise package: Borussia Dortmund or RB Leipzig, with the former to go deeper than most expect and the latter to tear Group G apart with venom and verve under extremely exciting new manager Julian Nagelsmann.\n\nLuke Bosher\u200b\n\nWinner \u2013 Manchester City. City should coast through their group and Laporte\u2019s return should coincide with the knockout rounds. Their attacking squad depth beats out everyone else.\n\nTop scorer \u2013 Robert Lewandowski\u200b. He loves goals and has a relatively easy group. Lewandowski could score six or seven against Olympiacos and Red Star Belgrade alone.\n\nBreakout player \u2013 Fabian Ruiz. Fabian was outstanding at the U21 Euros and won player of the tournament. The creative Spaniard has bags of talent and should help Napoli to progress through their group.\n\nFurthest English club \u2013 Manchester City\n\nSurprise package \u2013 Inter Milan. Antonio Conte is a fantastic manager and Inter signed very well in the summer. They have a tough group but I think they could surprise a few.", "description": "The world\u2019s premier club competition returns this week with the Champions League back with a bang with a full slate of games featuring the very best 32 teams Europe has to offer.", "authors": ["Sports Staff"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/15/14/liverpool-champions-league.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
