Washington also wants to pressure Tehran to end its support of regional proxy forces, including in Yemen where Saudi forces have been fighting Iran-backed Houthis for four years.\n\nThe United States was still investigating if Iran was behind the Saudi strikes, Trump said, but \u201cit\u2019s certainly looking that way at this moment.\u201d\n\nTrump, who has spent much of his presidency trying to disentangle the United States from wars he inherited, made clear, however, he was not going to rush into a new conflict on behalf of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m somebody that would like not to have war,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSeveral U.S. Cabinet members, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the strikes. Pompeo and others will travel to Saudi Arabia soon, Trump said.\n\nA day after saying the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d to respond to the incident, Trump said on Monday there was \u201cno rush\u201d to do so.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of options but I\u2019m not looking at options right now. We want to find definitively who did this,\u201d he said.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani said the strikes were carried out by \u201cYemeni people\u201d retaliating for attacks by a Saudi-led military coalition in a war with the Houthi movement.\n\n\u201cYemeni people are exercising their legitimate right of defense,\u201d Rouhani told reporters during a visit to Ankara.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi called the allegations \u201cunacceptable and entirely baseless.\u201d\n\nThe attacks cut 5% of world crude oil production.\n\nOil prices surged by as much as 19% after the incidents but later came off their peaks. The intraday jump was the biggest since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait.\n\nThe market eased from its peak after Trump said he would release U.S. emergency supplies and producers said there were enough stocks stored up worldwide to make up for the shortfall. Prices were around 12% higher by afternoon in the United States.\n\nSAUDI SUSPICIONS\n\nSaudi Arabia said the attacks were carried out with Iranian weapons, adding that it was capable of responding forcefully and urging U.N. experts to help investigate the raid.\n\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iranian threats were not only directed against the kingdom but against the Middle East and the world.\n\nWhile the prince did not directly accuse Tehran, a Foreign Ministry statement reported him as calling on the international community to condemn whoever was behind the strike.\n\n\u201cThe kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSaudi Arabia and Iran have been enemies for decades and are fighting a number of proxy wars.\n\nTrump said he had not made commitments to protect the Saudis.\n\nA satellite image showing damage to oil/gas Saudi Aramco infrastructure at Khurais, in Saudi Arabia in this handout picture released by the U.S Government September 15, 2019.

We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn\u2019t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them.\u201d\n\nTwo sources briefed on state oil company Saudi Aramco\u2019s operations told Reuters it might take months for Saudi oil production to return to normal. Earlier estimates had suggested it could take weeks.\n\nSaudi Arabia said it would be able to meet oil customers\u2019 demand from its ample storage, although some deliveries had been disrupted. At least 11 supertankers were waiting to load oil cargoes from Saudi ports, ship tracking data showed on Monday.\n\nRISING TENSIONS\n\nTension in the oil-producing Gulf region has dramatically escalated this year after Trump imposed severe U.S. sanctions on Iran aimed at halting its oil exports altogether.\n\nFor months, Iranian officials have issued veiled threats, saying that if Tehran is blocked from exporting oil, other countries will not be able to do so either. But Iran has denied a role in specific attacks, including bombings of tankers in the Gulf and previous strikes claimed by the Houthis.\n\nU.S. allies in Europe oppose Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d strategy, arguing that it provides no clear mechanism to resolve issues, creating a risk the enemies could stumble into war.\n\nTrump has said his goal is to force Iran to negotiate a tougher agreement and has left open the possibility of talks with Rouhani at an upcoming U.N. meeting. Iran says there can be no talks until Washington lifts sanctions.\n\nU.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council on Monday it was \u201cnot entirely clear\u201d who was behind the strike but he said it had increased the chances of a regional conflict.\n\nBut the U.S. ambassador to the world body, Kelly Craft, said emerging information on the attacks \u201cindicates that responsibility lies with Iran\u201d and that there is no evidence the attack came from Yemen.\n\nIran\u2019s Yemeni allies have promised more strikes to come. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday\u2019s predawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,\u201d Sarea tweeted. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nU.S. officials say they believe that the attacks came from the opposite direction, possibly from Iran itself rather than Yemen, and may have involved cruise missiles. Wherever the attacks were launched, however, they believe Iran is to blame.\n\nThe attacks have raised questions about how the kingdom, one of the world\u2019s top spenders on weaponry, much of it supplied by U.S. companies, was unable to protect oil plants from attack.\n\nSensing a commercial opening, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was ready to help Saudi Arabia by providing Russian-made air defense systems to protect Saudi infrastructure.\n\nRussia and China said it was wrong to jump to conclusions about who was to blame for the attack on Saudi Arabia.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday said it looked like Iran was behind attacks on oil plants in Saudi Arabia but stressed he did not want to go to war, as the attacks sent oil prices soaring and raised fears of a new Middle East conflict.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430480515&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0ZX", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
