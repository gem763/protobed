[L5N2786MF]\n\nLiverpool had not won away from home in group play since a 7-0 win in Maribor two years ago but ended that sequence in emphatic fashion with a clinical display of firepower.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely missed (the Champions League),\u201d Oxlade-Chamberlain, who sat out almost the whole of last season, said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be back in the starting line-up and put in a performance to help the team.\u201d\n\nIt took them only two minutes for Oxlade-Chamberlain to make his mark. Receiving the ball just outside the area in a central position he took aim and fired a low shot inside the post.\n\nGenk, who held Napoli to a 0-0 draw on matchday two after a 6-2 thrashing by Salzburg, were not about to roll over and their pace caused several alarms in the Liverpool defence.\n\nA ball over the top released Tanzanian striker Mbwana Samatta but he shot wide and soon afterwards Paul Onuachu also got behind the Liverpool defence but was denied by Alisson.\n\nA wide-open match then saw Liverpool go close to a second goal when Roberto Firmino\u2019s clever flick release Mane inside the area but his shot was saved by Ga\u00ebtan Coucke.\n\nThe chances came thick and fast and Liverpool had a let-off in the 26th minute when Samatta\u2019s bullet header beat Alisson but his celebrations were cut short when referee Slavko Vincic disallowed it and a lengthy VAR check backed up the most marginal of offside decisions.\n\nRelated Coverage Liverpool end away jinx but Klopp didn't enjoy win in Genk\n\nGenk were still in the hunt but Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Liverpool breathing space in the 57th minute with a goal of supreme skill. Firmino played the ball back to the former Arsenal man and he dug out a first-time shot with the outside of his right foot that flew past Coucke and in off the bar.\n\nMane gave the scoreline a rather flattering look when he finished off a superb move after 77 minutes and Salah rubbed salt into the hosts\u2019 wounds with a silky turn and deft finish as Genk finally began to run out of steam.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s win made it a full house for the four English clubs in Champions League action this week with Chelsea winning earlier and Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday.", "description": "Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain marked his return to the Champions League arena with two superb goals as Liverpool claimed their first group stage win on the road for two years with a 4-1 triumph at Belgian club Racing Genk on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444257457&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1ZF", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
