It is said to have been taken by Epstein at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell during a visit to London in 2001, when Roberts Giuffre was about 17.\n\nThe image has dogged Andrew since it was first published in 2011 by the Mail on Sunday, which paid Roberts Giuffre for the photograph and detailed her account of encountering Andrew while serving as a traveling \u201csex slave\u201d to his friend Epstein.\n\nLast week, unidentified \u201csources close to\u201d Andrew were quoted by the Daily Telegraph and the London Evening Standard raising doubts about the photograph\u2019s authenticity. They argued Andrew\u2019s fingers were \u201cchubbier\u201d than they appear in the picture and that he was taller than depicted.\n\nBut one of Roberts Giuffre\u2019s attorneys, Brad Edwards, told the Guardian the photograph was authentic and had not been altered.\n\nEdwards shared a letter addressing the claims that he and David Boies, another of Roberts Giuffre\u2019s attorneys, sent to Andrew this week at the prince\u2019s home in Windsor, following earlier remarks by Andrew expressing sympathy for Epstein\u2019s victims.\n\nEdwards wrote: \u201cWhile your recent press statements indicate your sincere desire to help the victims of sexual abuse, we are concerned that certain statements attributed to you (which we hope do not reflect your actual views) are quite inconsistent with a desire to deal responsibly with the serious allegations that have been made.\u201d\n\nThe letter read: \u201cWe now see, for instance, a troubling assertion attributed to you that a well-documented photograph depicting you, Virginia Roberts Giuffre and Ghislaine Maxwell in each other\u2019s company is a \u2018fake\u2019.\u201d\n\nEdwards reminded Andrew that he had been asked by lawyers \u201cto discuss the circumstances surrounding this long-held photograph\u201d several years ago, during the course of civil legal actions brought against Epstein.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cWe were puzzled and, we must admit, disappointed that you did not cooperate at that time. Nevertheless, given your new attention to the subject and your pledge to cooperate, we renew our request for your cooperation.\u201d\n\nRoberts Giuffre alleged in a December 2014 court filing that she was made to have sex with Andrew among other friends of Epstein. Andrew has always vehemently denied the allegation.\n\nIn 2015, a judge ruled that the allegations made by Roberts Giuffre about the prince were \u201cimmaterial and impertinent\u201d and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein.\n\nIn a statement last month, Andrew accepted it was \u201ca mistake and an error\u201d to have continued seeing Epstein after the disgraced money manager pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.\n\nBut he insisted that at no time with Epstein did he \u201csee, witness or suspect\u201d behavior relating to sexual abuse. He also reiterated his denials of any wrongdoing.\n\nEpstein, who was 66, was found dead in his jail cell in New York last month. He was awaiting trial on federal charges brought more than a decade after his original plea deal with US authorities in Florida.\n\nThe plea agreement allowed Epstein to serve 13 months of an 18-month prison sentence, much of it on day-release.\n\nThe deal had come under renewed scrutiny in recent months following a series of articles published by the Miami Herald. In addition to the new charges against Epstein, the renewed anger led Alex Acosta, the prosecutor who oversaw Epstein\u2019s deal, to resign as Donald Trump\u2019s labour secretary.", "description": "Virginia Roberts Giuffre\u2019s attorney says picture said to have been taken at Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s home is authentic and unaltered", "authors": ["Jon Swaine"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82127c72254c2e281ad5d790c1e7a75ce923d26c/0_69_1056_633/master/1056.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c2d7d020cc87b1fa5eca2aeb0d8a6ea", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
