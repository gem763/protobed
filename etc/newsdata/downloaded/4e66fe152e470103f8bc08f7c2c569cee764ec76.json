It also prompted a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters held in Kurdish jails.\n\nTrump has praised the deal with NATO-ally Turkey as one that would save lives. Turkey cast it as a victory in its campaign to control territory more than 30 km (around 20 miles) deep into Syria and drive out Kurdish fighters from the YPG, the SDF\u2019s main Kurdish component. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents in southeast Turkey.\n\n\u201cAs of now, the 120-hour period is on. In this 120-hour period, the terrorist organisation, the YPG, will leave the area we identified as a safe zone,\u201d Erdogan told reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul. The safe zone would be 32 km deep, and run \u201c440 km from the very west to the east\u201d, he said.\n\nBut the U.S. special envoy for Syria, James Jeffrey, said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting, between the two border towns of Ras al Ain and Tel Abyad, just 120 km away.\n\nSpeaking to journalists later on Friday, Erdogan said Turkey plans to set up 12 observation posts in northeast Syria. A map of the region showed the planned posts stretching from the Iraq border in the east to the Euphrates river 300 miles to the west.\n\nSmoke rises from a building near the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 18, 2019.

Whether they incorporate that later into a Turkish-controlled safe zone, it was not discussed in any detail.\u201d\n\nLIFTING SANCTIONS?\n\nThe joint U.S.-Turkish statement released after Thursday\u2019s talks said Washington and Ankara would cooperate on handling Islamic State fighters and family members held in prisons and camps - an important international concern.\n\nPence said U.S. sanctions imposed on Tuesday would be lifted once the ceasefire became permanent.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. senators who have criticised the Trump administration for failing to prevent the Turkish assault said they would press ahead with legislation to impose sanctions against Turkey.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria was \u201ca grave strategic mistake.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish assault began after Trump moved U.S. troops out of the way following an Oct. 6 phone call with Erdogan.\n\nTurkey says the \u201csafe zone\u201d would make room to settle up to 2 million Syrian war refugees - roughly half the number it is currently hosting - and would push back the YPG militia.", "description": "Turkey will set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, insisting that a planned \"safe zone\" will extend much farther than U.S. officials said was covered under a fragile ceasefire deal.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442391823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H13O", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
