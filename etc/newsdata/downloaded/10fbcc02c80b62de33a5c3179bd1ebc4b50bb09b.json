It\u2019s a cliche that sounds pretty cruel applied to Parasite, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s brilliant, insidious twist on the home-invasion thriller, in which a frostily modernist luxury house serves as several different things to different people \u2013 a status symbol, a shelter, a prison \u2013 but doesn\u2019t offer homely comforts to anyone, exactly. Yet it\u2019s true, in a funny way, for Bong himself. A globally minded film-maker with big-dreaming genre nous, he has spent the last few years making a bid for mainstream Hollywood clout, only to finally make an international phenomenon from his own doorstep.\n\nParasite review \u2013 creepy invasion of the lifestyle snatchers Read more\n\nBong\u2019s last two films, 2013\u2019s Snowpiercer and 2017\u2019s Okja, were his first to be made in English: they weren\u2019t exactly misfires, either critically or commercially, yet both clearly had designs on being bigger deals than they were. Adapted from a comic book, with brawny Marvel man Chris Evans in the lead, Snowpiercer was a delirious dystopian adventure that merged Bong\u2019s auteurist eccentricity with bolshy blockbuster aspirations: it raked in over $82m outside the US, double its production budget (at $40m, then a record for a Korean production).\n\nIn the States, however, its bullet-train momentum was halted by the ignoble figure of Harvey Weinstein, as Bong joined the long line of directors to fight \u201cHarvey Scissorhands\u201d over the film\u2019s final edit. The director refused to follow Weinstein\u2019s proposed cuts and additions; the impasse delayed the film\u2019s American release for a year, prompting \u201cFree Snowpiercer\u201d protests from impatient fans. Finally, the uncut film was granted a release, albeit a limited one on the Weinsteins\u2019 lower-profile Radius-TWC label. It took just $4.5m: the film may not have been conventional popcorn fare, but it clearly had set its sights higher than that. (Meanwhile, it never even made it to UK cinemas.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bong Joon Ho directing Okja.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton were on hand too, acting with the level of subtlety you\u2019d expect of a Jon Ronson-scripted film about a mall-trashing, genetically modified superpig escaping the slaughterhouse with the loving help of an adorable tyke: Babe on highly aggressive steroids, if you will. Bong had more sympathetic Tinseltown partners than Weinstein this time: Netflix and Brad Pitt\u2019s Plan B Entertainment boarded the project early, stumping up a $50m production budget (breaking Snowpiercer\u2019s aforementioned record).\n\nIt premiered at Cannes, in the last year that the tradition-bound French festival permitted Netflix\u2019s film in its competition, and was well enough received: scattered boos were directed at the streaming service rather than the film itself. But by the time it popped up on the Netflix platform a month later, it felt a bit of a non-event. Critical enthusiasm was muted relative to Bong\u2019s earlier, wilder, more homegrown genre rides like Mother and The Host, and it quietly sank into Netflix\u2019s unquantifiable morass of content \u2013 it\u2019s doubtless been seen by many, but it never felt like anyone was really talking about it.\n\nParasite, on the other hand, has been inspiring itchy international conversation since its premiere at Cannes, where it wowed critics and Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s jury, who unanimously handed it the Palme d\u2019Or. Many a Palme d\u2019Or winner goes quiet outside the rarefied film-festival atmosphere; Parasite, with its inky comedy driven by seething social fury, has found its public. With multiple global territories (including the US, UK and Japan) yet to weigh in, it has already grossed $91m worldwide; eager chatter about it is lighting up social media. (If you don\u2019t believe me, search the #BongHive hashtag on Twitter to see the film\u2019s Generation Z cult in action.) Its hip US distributor Neon will be planning a lively Oscar campaign, targeting not just the foreign-language category, but a best picture nomination too. That would surely seal its status as the biggest Korean crossover phenomenon in film history: the BTS of cinema, effectively.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty remarkable trajectory for a film that, in addition to its chilly, bleak outlook and grisly violence, is entirely uncompromised in its sheer Korean-ness: no English dialogue or Hollywood stars here, while the film is so vivid in its cultural specifics that jjapaguri \u2013 a kind of local instant noodle dish \u2013 serves as a key plot point. Yet Parasite\u2019s delicious indigenous details hardly obscure its more universal agenda: it\u2019s a film that taps into a kind of anti-capitalist rage against rigid structures of class and privilege that are being felt everywhere from Korea to America to Brexit Britain. Bong\u2019s rollercoaster storytelling skills are a factor too, of course, but it turns out the way to engage a global audience, in this case, was not to play Hollywood\u2019s own game: it\u2019s the political resonance of Parasite, not any stylistic familiarity, that is striking a chord across continents.\n\nBong isn\u2019t the only world-cinema auteur of late, meanwhile, to find that you can go home again. His compatriot Park Chan-wook befuddled audiences with his bewitchingly bonkers American debut Stoker; an indifferent commercial reception sent him back to home turf, where he made The Handmaiden and landed a global arthouse sensation. (He\u2019s since surprised us again, heading over to the BBC to direct the very chic Le Carr\u00e9 miniseries The Little Drummer Girl; so far, this back-and-forth travelling has cramped his style.)\n\nHaifaa Al-Mansour, the first Saudi woman to direct a feature with the arthouse charmer Wadjda, bombed when she headed abroad to make the literary biopic Mary Shelley; she headed back to Saudi Arabia to direct the crowd-pleasing feminist parable The Perfect Candidate, which was warmly received at Venice and Toronto last month, and has been entered by her home country as its Oscar submission.\n\nThese are different journeys, of course, from that of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who capitalised on his vast Hollywood success to head home for his most personal project to date \u2013 though the lavish acclaim and awards heaped upon his Netflix-backed Mexican memory piece Roma nonetheless made it a career milestone. Its good fortune, like Parasite\u2019s, proves that Hollywood is no longer necessarily the final destination for a successful directorial career: sometimes it\u2019s just the Emerald City, en route to a happy homecoming.", "description": "The director\u2019s wildly acclaimed, Oscar-buzzed thriller marks a fascinating high point in a career that\u2019s recovered from a Hollywood struggle", "authors": ["Guy Lodge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb4359a36644f78837db777b0ce22ce5e33156d/0_112_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f8220d3414b0d2230a942efa1c0fe8e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
