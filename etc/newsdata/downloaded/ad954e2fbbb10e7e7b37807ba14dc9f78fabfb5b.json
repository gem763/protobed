They make each bowl feel special. Miso soup is traditionally made with dashi, an umami-rich stock made from kombu seaweed and dried bonito, a kind of tuna. But this recipe takes a different path to those deep flavors, substituting chicken broth and optional dried shiitake mushrooms, found in the produce department or international aisle of many grocery stores. Finally, a quick kombu steep adds umami. The ingredient is available at more specialty grocers and online, but feel free to leave it out. The soup will still be delicious.", "description": "The slow cooker puts a weeknight ramen fix within reach; don't skimp on the toppings here, which you can customize to your liking They make each bowl feel special Miso soup is traditionally made with dashi, an umami-rich stock made from kombu seaweed and dried bonito, a kind of tuna", "authors": ["Sarah Digregorio", "Tejal Rao", "Lidey Heuck", "Nigella Lawson", "Sam Sifton", "Alison Roman", "Erin Jeanne Mcdowell", "Ali Slagle", "David Tanis", "Claire Saffitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/dining/sd-miso-chicken-ramen/sd-miso-chicken-ramen-articleLarge-v2.jpg"}
