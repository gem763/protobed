Rowe Price Funds for 401(k) Retirement Savers", "language": "en", "text": "\n\n\n\nA dozen T. Rowe Price funds appear among the top 100 401(k) funds this year, according to data firm BrightScope. Interestingly, all are funds that focus on growth stocks, and all are standouts in their categories.\n\nThat shouldn't surprise anyone. Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., the late founder of T. Rowe Price, often is called the father of growth investing. His investing process, which centers on a deep dive into a company's nitty-gritty details, still thrives at the Baltimore firm. And it's clearly popular among retirement savers.\n\nWe analyzed each one as part of our annual review of the most popular funds for 401(k) retirement savings accounts. Seven of the 12 T. Rowe Price funds are target-date funds, and they are analyzed as a single unit.\n\nHere are some of the best T. Rowe Price funds for your 401(k), as well as one popular option that doesn't make the cut. We rate each one either Buy, Sell or Hold, and discuss why these funds stand out from the crowd.\n\nT. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth: BUY\n\nGetty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nSymbol: TRBCX\n\nExpense ratio: 0.70%\n\nOne-year return: 3.5%\n\nThree-year annualized return: 17.2%\n\nFive-year annualized return: 13.6%\n\n10-year annualized return: 15.4%\n\nRank among the top 401(k) funds: #32\n\nBest for: Aggressive investors with long time horizons.\n\nA handful of actively managed funds have been longtime stock-market outperformers. T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth - a member of the Kiplinger 25, our favorite no-load funds - is one of them.\n\nManager Larry Puglia has been with the fund since it opened in 1993. Puglia fills his portfolio with established companies that are run by smart executives, boast strong free cash flow (cash profits after capital outlays) and exhibit above-average earnings growth. A sizable chunk of the fund's $63 billion in assets sits in tech, health-care and consumer-oriented firms. TRBCX holds nearly 130 stocks and has a low relative turnover of 27%, half that of its peers: funds that invest in large, growing companies.\n\nThe wind has been blowing Puglia's way lately. The fund's large-cap growth-oriented mandate falls in what has been the sweet spot of the current bull market. And Blue Chip Growth has done better than the broad market, with a 15.4% annualized 10-year return, which beats the 12.7% return in the S&P 500.\n\nTRBCX has held up well when growth stocks have stumbled in the past, too. For instance, during the broad U.S. stock market's so-called lost decade, Blue Chip Growth stayed in step with the S&P 500, returning an annualized 1.4% between 2001 and 2010. And during the late 2018 swoon, it lagged the 19.4% loss in the S&P 500, but only by 0.7 percentage points.\n\nThis fund is a keeper.\n\nT. Rowe Price Growth Stock: BUY", "description": "A dozen T.
