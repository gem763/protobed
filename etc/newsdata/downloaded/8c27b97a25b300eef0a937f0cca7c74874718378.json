The signs are not good.\n\nWeWork looks like a bubble waiting to burst Read more\n\nAfter years of hype, Neumann\u2019s plan to become one of the world\u2019s richest entrepreneurs on the back of a 22% stake in WeWork, now known as the We Company, have been hit hard. The value of the company has been cut from $47bn to as low as $15bn. Even their major investor, the Japanese, Saudi-backed SoftBank, has reportedly argued against pressing ahead with the sale, a delay that threatens a $6bn loan needed to fund an aggressive global expansion of the brand.\n\nIt\u2019s a major dent to Neumann\u2019s dream to build a multibillion-dollar global space-sharing real estate firm built on the trust and community spirit of \u201cwe\u201d and the vision \u201cto elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d.\n\nThe share sale comes as investors have become increasingly skeptical of profit-free tech, or tech-related, companies that have built their businesses on piles of Silicon Valley cash.\n\nThose investors have been burned by offerings by the ridesharing companies Uber and Lyft and watched as Neumann, whose first frays into entrepreneurship were a collapsible high heel for women and a baby romper with reinforced knees, has marketed his \u201cwe\u201d concept with an evangelism that often veers into faux-spiritualism.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A WeWork location in New York City.

Rebekah Neumann introduced him to the Kabbalah, the esoteric Jewish faith once followed by Madonna. Rebekah Neumann has said when she met Neumann he was too thin and smoking too many cigarettes. She told him to ditch the suitcases of ill-fitting rompers and stop talking about money. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about wellness, happiness, fulfillment, and if the money is supposed to follow, it will,\u201d she told him.\n\nAnd it has, to an extent that has worried some investors and corporate governance experts. Part of investors\u2019 anxiety about WeWork is the unusually large amount Neumann has already taken out of the company \u2013 $700m \u2013 in a series of unorthodox personal loans, real estate leases and stock sales ahead of its initial public offering (IPO).\n\nNeumann also owns at least four buildings that he rents to WeWork, thus collecting $20m in rent from his own company. And WeWork still owes Neumann an amazing $236.6m in \u201cfuture undiscounted minimum lease payments\u201d.\n\nUntil last month, when an effort to appease potential investors caused a rethink, he was also collecting $7.9m a year renting the \u201cwe\u201d trademark to the company.\n\nMoreover, WeWork\u2019s IPO prospectus explicitly warned investors: \u201cAdam\u2019s voting control will limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate activities and, as a result, we may take actions that stockholders other than Adam do not view as beneficial.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if you don\u2019t like it, get lost.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Adam Neumann, center, attends the opening bell ceremony at Nasdaq in New York, on 16 January 2018. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/AP\n\n\u201cThe revelations have ambushed this pristine brand image and undermined the confidence of investors,\u201d Eric Schiffer, chief executive of the investment firm Patriarch, said. \u201cGiven the prospect of losing $6bn, they\u2019d be crazy not to move forward, and quickly.\u201d\n\nOn Friday the Wall Street Journal reported We was making moves to reassure investors. The company is telling investors it will reduce the power of Neumann\u2019s voting rights to 10 votes a share from 20 votes a share and eliminate the role his wife would serve in choosing Neumann\u2019s successor if he cannot serve.\n\nThe question before investors now is whether or not they buy the idea that Neumann is a visionary such as Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. For Schiffer, the answer is no. \u201cMusk has a proven track record; Neumann\u2019s history does not show that. He\u2019s had one idea that could prove successful but it\u2019s a giant question mark.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt that Neumann has had an impact on office rentals. His idea was to rent real estate on long-term leases, parcel it up with some millennial styling (beer taps, lots of plants and cool sofas) and rent it out short-term. Started in 2010 from a single building on New York\u2019s Grand Street, Neumann found there was ready army of backpacking, laptop-wielding, earbudded young urban professionals who needed somewhere to drink coffee, work on startups, network and pick up partners.\n\nMusk has a proven track record; Neumann\u2019s history does not show that Eric Schiffer\n\nAs of 30 June, WeWork reported that it has 527,000 members and 528 locations, up from 485 in March, and said it plans to open 169 new locations. In London, it owns or leases more spaces than any enterprise except the government. Larger companies (including the Guardian) now rent WeWork space.\n\nAdam and Rebekah Neumann, of course, aren\u2019t dumb enough to rent. They own an impressive spread of real estate, including a townhouse in New York\u2019s West Village.\n\nBut like many so-called \u201cunicorns\u201d, private companies valued at more than $1bn, the only way to survive is to expand. There\u2019s no guarantee WeWork will ever reach profitability, as it makes clear in its prospectus. Investors are worried, especially as the company\u2019s expansion is focused on China, an unknown quantity at the best of times and especially now, potentially heading into a global recession and as rivals copy many of its moves.\n\nThe unfolding drama has already hit Neumann\u2019s wealth prospects. At one point, some estimated WeWork\u2019s value as a listed company could soon reach $65bn, valuing Neumann\u2019s stake at $14bn.\n\nAt the $15bn valuation now looking more likely, Neumann\u2019s stake would be worth $3bn \u2013 not enough for a listing in the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2013 but still not bad for a decade\u2019s work.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Neumann and We Company will see how their neo-utopian vision meshes with the hard realities of the public marketplace. \u201cWe are captivated by the limitless potential of We,\u201d Neumann said recently.\n\nWall Street seems less sure.", "description": "The space-sharing firm\u2019s value has been cut from $47bn to as low as $15bn ahead of its IPO \u2013 a major dent as its co-founder tries to sell the vision of \u2018we\u2019", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/438fcc45c6e522261aee00a1999ca0f1c97f2c10/0_184_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=334f6dbe21dce971bae91bb5d468b3e2", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
