Limits on commercial vehicle makers ease in 2020, and by 2022 for the wider car market.\n\nHyundai is reviewing various plans to strengthen the joint venture's competitiveness in changing market conditions in China, the firm said in an emailed statement, without elaborating.\n\nVolkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> is exploring the prospect of buying a big stake in its Chinese electric vehicle joint venture partner, sources have told Reuters, while BMW has agreed to buy control of its main joint venture in China.\n\nSichuan Hyundai Motor is jointly owned by Hyundai and China's Sichuan Nanjun Automotive Group, with a stake of 50% each.\n\nThe Sichuan joint venture, which started operations in 2013, produced 12,228 commercial vehicles last year, down by more than half from 28,786.\n\nThat means that their production facilities are heavily under utilised given that they have a capacity of making 160,000 trucks and 10,000 buses a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Ju-min Park and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Jacqueine Wong)", "description": "Hyundai Motor  said on Tuesday it was considering raising its stake in its underperforming truck joint venture in China, potentially joining other foreign automakers in boosting ownership in the world's biggest car market.
