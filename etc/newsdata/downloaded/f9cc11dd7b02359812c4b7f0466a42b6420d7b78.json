Electronics and ships were subject to zero tariffs even before the FTA between the two sides, \"so the FTA played a key role in cushioning the shock as seen in the 50 percent increase in EU investment in Korea during the second half of last year,\" according to Myung Jin-ho at KITA.\n\nThe FTA with Chile was sealed in 2004, and bilateral trade surged from US$1.85 billion the year before to $7.17 billion in 2010. Exports to the South American country rose a whopping 462 percent, while imports from Chile grew 218 percent. Excluding copper, which accounts for around 70 percent of imports from the country, Seoul has achieved a trade surplus every year, rising from $200 million in 2003 to $1.7 billion in 2010.\n\nThe average tariff rate of Korean exports to Chile was 6 percent before the FTA but fell to 2.9 percent in the first year the deal went into effect and dropped even further to 0.5 percent last year.\n\nAccording to a Foreign Ministry report last year on the concrete economic effects of FTAs, Korea's trade with Chile, Singapore, the EFTA, ASEAN and India in 2010 stood at $153.9 billion, leading to a trade surplus of $18.8 billion for Korea. That accounted for 17.3 percent of Korea's total trade volume and 39 percent of its overall trade surplus.\n\nCompared to pre-FTA days, Korea's trade with those groups rose 60 percent, while the trade surplus increased 168 percent.", "description": "What Are the Benefits of Korea's FTAs?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2012-03-15"}
