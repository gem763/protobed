He would use the proceeds to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d universal child care and the most far-reaching affordable housing plan in American history.\n\nThe wealth tax would start at 1% for net worth above $32 million, rising to 5% for those with assets over $1 billion and reaching as high as 8% on wealth over $10 billion.\n\nThere should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019\n\nHis plan is the most aggressive offered by any candidate in the Democratic primary, exceeding a similar wealth tax proposed by presidential rival Elizabeth Warren that tops out at 3%.\n\nThe plan reflects many of Sanders\u2019 ideas over the years, but it\u2019s also likely part of an effort to boost a campaign that appears to have lost ground to Warren and Democratic front-runner Joe Biden.\n\nRead: U.S. consumer confidence sinks to 3-month low on trade worries, softer jobs market\n\nA wealth tax would face myriad challenges, political, legal and logistical.\n\nDemocrats would have to hold the House and recapture control of the Republican-led Senate, for one thing.\n\nA conservative-leaning Supreme Court would also have to find a wealth tax constitutional, an outcome that legal experts say is by no means certain. Such a tax could also be delayed for months if not years due to legal challenges.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service would also need to be dramatically expanded to assess wealth and administer the tax, a process that other countries have found difficult. While it\u2019s relatively easy to figure out the value publicly traded assets such as stocks or bonds, other assets such as art, real estate and privately run businesses aren\u2019t easy to value.\n\nAs many as 14 of the world\u2019s 36 richest countries used to have wealth taxes, but that number has dwindled to just four, according to the Tax Foundation. Such taxes rarely raised as much money as proponents claims and the wealthy found ways to evade the tax or win political exemptions.\n\nMost recently, France ended an unpopular wealth tax in 2018 that was blamed for causing the rich to flee and curtailing investment.\n\nUnder current U.S. law, assets are generally only taxed when they are sold. Billionaires such as Microsoft MSFT, -1.30% co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon AMZN, -0.83% founder Jeff Bezos, whose fortunes are largely concentrated in company stock, don\u2019t have to pay taxes on most of their wealth until they sell shares.\n\nA wealth tax, by contrast, would tax Gates and Bezos each year based on the total value of everything they owned regardless of whether they sold any assets.\n\nDemocrats such as Sanders and Warren insist a wealth tax is necessary to reduce inequality in the U.S., pay for badly needed social programs and prevent a small class of wealthy elites from rigging the political system for their benefit.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough. We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders would put in place a number of measures to prevent the uber-rich from evading the levy. The government would create a national registry to track the wealthy, audit the tax returns of every billionaire each year and beef up funding for IRS staffing and enforcement.\n\nAn \u201cexit tax\u201d of 60% would be applied to the net value of all assets of any billionaire seeking to become a citizen of any country to avoid the levy on wealth.\n\nSanders said his plan would reduce the wealth of billionaires by half over a 15-year period.\n\nLeft-leaning economists Gabriel Zucman and Emanuel Saez, longtime advocates of higher taxes on the rich, estimate the wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans would be 60% less if Sanders\u2019 tax had been in place since 1982.\n\n\u201cInstead of having a wealth of $7.2 billion on average (in 2018), they would have a wealth of $3 billion on average,\u201d Zucman and Saez wrote in evaluating the Sanders plan at his request.", "description": "Presidential contender Bernie Sanders on Tuesday said he\u2019s going to \u201ctake on the billionaire class\u201d by taxing their wealth up to 8% as part of a plan to pay...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM281_arends_ZG_20190626183935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
