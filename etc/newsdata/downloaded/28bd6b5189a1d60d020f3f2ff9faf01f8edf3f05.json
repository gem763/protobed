Then a brash 34-year-old fulfilling his dream of owning his childhood team, Snyder said the Redskins would deliver winning to their fans.\n\nTwenty years later, that has hardly been the case.\n\nAs the Redskins begin another season Sunday \u2014 their 21st under Snyder \u2014 on the road against the Philadelphia Eagles, Washington faces a plethora of issues, from its holdout star left tackle to a discontented fan base to a coach whose job is likely on the line. Team president Bruce Allen said this offseason he believed the Redskins were \u201cclose\u201d \u2014 leaving some fans asking: \u201cTo what?\u201d\n\nRevitalizing the Redskins has proven elusive and the problems facing Snyder, now 54, over the next 20 years won\u2019t be getting any easier. Beyond restoring a winning product on the field, Washington must finalize plans for \u2014 and then build \u2014 a new stadium with FedEx Field\u2019s lease set to expire in 2027.\n\nIn the meantime, Washington will try to turn around last season\u2019s flagging attendance figures from the suburban stadium with a team led by a coach on a short leash, a journeyman quarterback on his fifth team and a $181 million roster \u2014 19th highest in the league \u2014 that bookies rank as a 300-1 longshot to win the Super Bowl.\n\nThey\u2019re paying how much?\n\nPractically nothing about the Redskins\u2018 offense screams flashy. Running back Derrius Guice, with his swagger, or rookie quarterback Dwayne Haskins, with his rocket of an arm, may give fans reasons to be excited, but as a whole, Washington doesn\u2019t have the proven entities to be thought of as among the league\u2019s elites.\n\nSo, it may be a surprise to learn, then, the Redskins have the second-most expensive offense in 2019.\n\nYep: At $109.1 million, the Redskins trail only the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in that category. Washington, as a reminder, averaged just 17.6 points per game last season, ranking 29th.\n\nHow is that possible? For one, the Redskins are carrying a $20.4 million cap hit for quarterback Alex Smith, who is still on crutches after breaking his leg in November. Even if they wanted to move on, Smith\u2019s release would have carried a staggering $52 million cap hit \u2014 making it a non-option.\n\nAs a result, Washington added two more quarterbacks \u2014 Haskins ($2.6 million) and starter Case Keenum ($3.5 million) \u2014 to bring its cost at the position to $30.2 million, including Colt McCoy\u2019s $3.4 million. That\u2019s also the second-most expensive quarterback room in the NFL, trailing the Detroit Lions.\n\nFurther, Smith\u2019s release would carry a $21.4 million cap hit in 2020 if released after June 1.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere next year,\u201d said Jason Fitzgerald, a salary cap expert who founded the contract site Over The Cap.\n\nElsewhere on offense, the Redskins have committed the most money in the league to their tight ends: $17 million. Washington also uses 22% of its salary cap along the offensive line to pay for starters like Trent Williams, Brandon Scherff and Morgan Moses. (The Redskins, though, will not have to pay Williams if he does not report, potentially freeing up more cap room).\n\nA change in approach\n\nAs a salary cap expert for the Redskins in 2007 and 2008, J.I. Halsell\u2019s job was to take an idea from ownership and find a way to make it work within the team\u2019s budget \u2014 no matter how big the ask. And in those days, Washington found ways to be \u2026 creative.\n\nFor the first decade of Snyder\u2019s ownership, the Redskins developed a reputation of making over-the-top, if not reckless, signings to make a splash. Oftentimes, they flopped.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t been the case in a few years.\n\n\u201cWhen Bruce [Allen] came on board, they kind of got better at restraining themselves in free agency,\u201d Halsell said.\n\nSure, Landon Collins\u2019 six-year, $84 million contract this offseason prompted some to make a \u201csame ol\u2019 Redskins\u201d joke, but he was Washington\u2019s first notable free-agent signing since Josh Norman (five years, $75 million) in 2016. Both deals were justifiable, with Collins filling a major need and Norman coming off an All-Pro season at the time. The Redskins also paid Smith after trading for him, but the cost was in line with other quarterback salaries.\n\nEven then, the Redskins have $4.7 million in salary-cap space, which ranks 21st in the league. Not great, but manageable.\n\nOn defense, the Redskins have only $68 million committed this season \u2014 with only five teams spending less. In coach Jay Gruden\u2019s previous five years with the Redskins, Washington has invested significant draft capital on the defensive side of the ball with three first-round picks on the line alone.\n\nThe Redskins have put an emphasis on the draft \u2014 with 30 of their 53 players taken by them. Half of those 30 are on defense.\n\nGruden said this year, the Redskins are expecting five or six of their rookies to \u201ccontribute early and contribute a lot,\u201d which he admits is rare.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve drafted well the last couple of years,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThese guys have been pretty productive. It\u2019s a matter of growing your people in your system, which is good. These guys, you want to develop them and keep them here, so that they get better under your tutelage, you hope.\u201d\n\nBuilding around Haskins\n\nIn the NFL, teams are always looking for an edge when it comes to team building. As it turns out, taking advantage of a rookie quarterback\u2019s relatively cheap salary is a pretty good way to do that.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks greatly benefited from Russell Wilson\u2019s rookie-scale contract when they went to the Super Bowl in 2014 and 2015 \u2014 taking the money that normally would be reserved for a quarterback and spending it to surround him with talent. The Eagles, with Carson Wentz, and Los Angeles Rams, with Jared Goff, did the same. The Kansas City Chiefs have Super Bowl expectations with Patrick Mahomes.\n\nBut in order to do that, teams have to be in good financial shape with the rest of their roster. That will be key for the Redskins if they plan on building around Haskins, whose rookie contract will pay him only $14.4 million over the next four seasons.\n\nAccording to Over The Cap, the Redskins have a projected $38.4 million next season in cap space \u2014 a number that can easily change depending on how this year unfolds. For instance, Washington can free additional space if they release cornerback Josh Norman ($12.5 million in savings) and tight end Jordan Reed ($8.5 million in savings). If Williams doesn\u2019t report for the entire season, Washington would get a credit toward his salary ($10.8 million) that they can apply to its cap.\n\nWashington\u2019s projected room could also decrease if it extends Scherff this season. The two sides have yet to reach an agreement, but any possible deal \u2014 which could lead to Scherff being the league\u2019s highest-paid guard \u2014 would have to be factored in. At the same time, a Scherff extension would free up cap space this year by lowering Scherff\u2019s 2019 cap hit.\n\nTeams can roll over any unused salary cap toward next season.\n\nFitzgerald said the Redskins\u2018 salary cap situation ranks as \u201cmiddle of the pack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re poorly set up, but they\u2019re not really in a position either where you would probably look at them and say, \u2018They just go wild in free agency. They can add a lot of talent\u2019 relative to the rest of the league,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably just going to be kind of average.\u201d\n\nOver the last three years, the Redskins\u2018 precise problem has been not finding a way to be more than average. Washington hopes to change that this season, starting Sunday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
