The win marks a record for Sri Lanka as they beat the green shirts by the highest run-margin so far in T20Is.\n\nNuwan Pradeep and Isuru Udana shared three wickets apiece to rattle the opposition\u2019s batting line.\n\nEarlier, Young pacer Mohammad Husnain (3-37) helped Pakistan at the crunch moments as they restricted Sri Lanka to 165-5 after facing a tough start.\n\nHusnain removed dangerous-looking Dasun Shanaka and Shehan Jayasuriya on back-to-back deliveries in the 19th over which put the visitors in pressure. At once, Sri Lanka was looking in good stance as they were 135-3 in 16 overs.\n\nDanushka Gunathilaka provided a magnificent start to the tourists as he smoked 57 runs off just 38 balls. Gunathilaka took no time to cross his fifty in just 33 balls as Sri Lanka reached 77-0 in 8 overs.\n\nIn the 10th over, Gunathilaka failed to pick up the length of Shadab Khan and the missed sweep shot went in favor of Pakistan as Aleem Dar raised the finger.\n\nOpener Avishka Fernando (33) partnered well with his partner Gunathilaka as they both put 84 runs together on the scoreboard.\n\nNuwan Pradeep brings an early breakthrough for Sri Lanka as Babar Azam edged the ball straight in the hands of keeper Minod Bhanoka.\n\nYoung pacer Mohammad Husnain (3-37) helped Pakistan at the crunch moments as they restricted Sri Lanka to 165-5 after facing a tough start in the first T20I at Gaddafi Stadium Lahore.\n\nHusnain removed dangerous-looking Dasun Shanaka and Shehan Jayasuriya on back-to-back deliveries in the 19th over which put the visitors in pressure.

They were three down for just 22 runs in 5th over when Sarfraz Ahmed joined hands with Iftikhar Ahmed to settle down the things.\n\nThey both put 46 runs together on the scoreboard and took Pakistan 22-3 to 68-4 in 12th over. But a miscommunication happened between the two set batsmen and Iftikhar got a runout in the same over after scoring 25 runs.\n\nThe wicket at the crucial stage once again disturbed the things for Pakistan as just after an over skipper Sarfraz got bowled off Hasaranga De Silva who took two wickets for his team. He scored 24 runs off 30 balls.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Openers Danushka Gunathilaka (43*) and Avishka Fernando (10*) have partnered well to score 64-0 runs for Sri Lanka in the power play.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Akmal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
