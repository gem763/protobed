News). \"It's made me feel more confused and it's just kind of, like, put more salt in the wound.\"\n\nKramer said she understood Caussin\u2019s willingness to be forthcoming in order to help others, but also noted that the couple choosing to reveal their turbulence was a \u201cmassive lesson learned\u201d on not always sharing personal matters in real-time.\n\n\"There are people out there who think Mike actually cheated,\" she said on the podcast. Caussin has vehemently promised his wife that it \"won't happen again,\" a plea Kramer said she has \"heard so many times.\"\n\nJANA KRAMER, MIKE CAUSSIN REVEAL MARRIAGE TROUBLES AFTER SHE FOUND A WOMAN HAD SENT HIM A TOPLESS PHOTO\n\n\"I think maybe now he sees how bad that wound is for me and the trauma of finding things \u2013 whether he did something or not,\" said Kramer. \"I'm to the point of, like, literally a nervous breakdown, where I just can't physically handle it anymore.\"\n\nHowever, despite Caussin\u2019s constant contrition to his wife of over four years, Kramer told the ex-professional athlete that she doesn\u2019t believe he can remain on the straight-and-narrow.\n\n\"I told Michael the other day, I was just like, I don't believe that there won't be another time, and that sucks too, like, have to feel that,\" she lamented. \"How do I believe that when I've heard so many times, \u2018I'll never do it again. I'll never do it again?' So, it kind of puts me in this really awkward situation, and it makes me look weak and to have to be, like, continuing to stick around, whether he did something or he didn't. I believe that he didn't. I know it wasn't a real person. I know all of those things. It doesn't matter.\"\n\nKramer maintained that the real \u201ctrauma\u201d for her is in the consistency that she keeps \u201cfinding things out,\u201d and drove home the point that she\u2019s just tired of it at this point.\n\nJANA KRAMER DESCRIBES FINDING OUT ABOUT HUSBAND'S CHEATING RIGHT BEFORE GOING ON STAGE\n\n\"I need him to understand how deep that wound is for me when I discover something, whether he did something or not,\" she said. \"That is just like \u2013 it's painful. And I just can't physically hold that anymore.\"\n\nCaussin revealed that he regretted going public with the incident, adding that he was hurt to learn of people questioning his sex addiction in social media comments made to Kramer. Caussin said he rarely sees them because he isn\u2019t on social media.\n\n\"Right now, I mean, all I can do is be as empathetic as I can with you and understanding and do whatever I need to do [to] create safety around things,\" Caussin told his wife.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, Kramer still voiced her concern that she and Caussin live in a revolving cycle of lies and despair surrounding Caussin\u2019s pattern of behavior.\n\n\"I think, again, what's scary is the what happens the next time for me,\" she said, \"because I just know I can't \u2013 and, again, no matter what it is. And I think that's hard, but that's my truth with it, you know?\"", "description": "Jana Kramer is still feeling uneasy about placing her full trust in her husband Mike Caussin after the former NFL tight end received a topless picture from a mystery woman and proceeded to delete it without informing her.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/jana-kramer-michael-caussin-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
