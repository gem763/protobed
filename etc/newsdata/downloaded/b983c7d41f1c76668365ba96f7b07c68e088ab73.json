When a beaming Trump and his entourage, which consisted of first lady Melania Trump, adviser Ivanka Trump and a gaggle of Republican leaders, showed up on the stadium\u2019s Jumbotron, many in the sellout crowd instantly reacted \u2014 with prolonged booing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThen, Trump turned to Melania and was like, \u2018Wow, they really don\u2019t like you,\u2019 \u201d Fallon quipped.\n\nBut there was little confusion Sunday about who had set off the rowdy fans during the third inning. The crowd\u2019s thundering boos were soon joined by chants of \u201cLock him up!\u201d and \u201cImpeach Trump,\u201d while some attendees displayed signs and banners with similar messages. Throughout Monday, the aggressive heckling dominated news broadcasts and social media as debate raged over whether the fans\u2019 behavior was appropriate.\n\nAmong late-night comics, however, Trump\u2019s not-so-warm welcome only inspired additional ridicule.\n\nCBS host Stephen Colbert kicked off his show with a cold open that featured a parody of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game,\u201d turning the classic baseball song into an impeachment anthem.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTake him out of the office, drag him out if you must,\u201d a chorus of voices sang as edited footage from Sunday\u2019s game played. \u201cGo back to Trump Steaks and lousy hotels. Please take Eric and Junior as well. We all root, root, root for impeachment. If Trump\u2019s not removed, it\u2019s insane. For it\u2019s one term, is more than enough. You\u2019re a shame, shame, shame.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn #LSSC tonight: The World Series got a visit from President Trump. pic.twitter.com/npLMpptqH1 \u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) October 29, 2019\n\nColbert continued to pile on Trump, pointing out that \u201cthe president of the United States got booed while watching the national pastime.\u201d\n\n\u201cA great American moment,\u201d he said. \u201cMade me proud.\u201d\n\nFor Seth Meyers, the highlight of the night was \u201cjust watching the joy drain out of Trump\u2019s face\u201d when it dawned on the president that the crowd wasn\u2019t cheering. Videos showed a smiling Trump clapping and waving from his spot in a luxury suite as the ballpark filled with boos. Within seconds, the grin was gone and an expressionless Trump could be seen staring straight forward before the camera panned back to the field.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like a kid on Christmas who sees a giant present and then opens it, and it\u2019s just a box full of packing peanuts and a Yankee Candle,\u201d Meyers joked on his NBC show.\n\nNot everyone, though, had such gleeful reactions to the way Trump was treated at the game. \u201cMorning Joe\u201d co-hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski denounced the \u201cLock him up!\u201d chant Monday on MSNBC, calling the words \u201csickening\u201d and \u201cun-American.\u201d Scarborough and Brzezinski\u2019s comments were also echoed in broadcasts from Fox News, where host Laura Ingraham\u2019s Monday show included a chyron that read in all-caps, \u201cTHE SWAMP DISRESPECTS TRUMP & AMERICA.\u201d\n\nAD\n\ngreat googly moogly pic.twitter.com/ziQHzWvJ0K \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 29, 2019\n\nFallon was quick to push back against those criticisms.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEvery outfielder who\u2019s ever played in New York, Boston or Philly was like: \u2018Toughen up, buttercup. I\u2019m getting hit with D-cell batteries for nine innings,\u2019 \u201d he said, referencing a 2011 Philadelphia Inquirer column that appeared to encourage baseball fans to hurl the large batteries at a player.\n\nMeanwhile, Colbert suggested that Trump, who has not publicly addressed the booing, learned a lesson from Sunday night\u2019s spectacle.\n\n\u201cIt has been a long time since Donald Trump faced anything other than a crowd of handpicked supporters, and I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a while before he does that again,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt has been a long time since Donald Trump faced anything other than a crowd of handpicked supporters, and I have a feeling it\u2019s going to be a while before he does that again,\u201d Stephen Colbert said Monday.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZJNLkQ_PfIu3TkvuzEi6b8HKW0c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D6IQVLHP35AKPEXKXIP4ZOPZAU.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
