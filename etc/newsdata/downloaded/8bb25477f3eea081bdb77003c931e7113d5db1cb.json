Ilhan Omar of Minnesota said in a podcast out Thursday that it would take something \u201ctragic\u201d for fellow Democrats to nominate Joseph R. Biden or Pete Buttigieg for president.\n\nThe first-term congresswoman made the comment while being asked about the candidates during a rapid-fire round of questions near the end of an interview conducted by The Intercept.\n\n\u201cIf one of them is the candidate for your party, who would you rather it be?\u201d she was asked by the interviewer.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying if something tragic happened and they ended up being the nominee?\u201d Ms. Omar replied.\n\nPressed further to answer with whatever comes to mind upon hearing both candidates\u2019 names, Ms. Omar replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard. \u2018None\u2019 comes to my head.\u201d\n\nMs. Omar has endorsed Sen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont Independent, as her preferred Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nSeveral recent nationwide polls have placed Mr. Sanders among the top three front-runners seeking the Democratic nod in 2020, typically alongside Mr. Biden, who previously served eight years as vice president under former President Barack Obama, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Democrat.\n\nMr. Buttigieg, a Democrat currently serving his second term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has recently surged in the polls among fellow candidates seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run in 2020 against President Trump, however.\n\nThe results released Thursday of a statewide poll conducted in Iowa, one of the first states to hold nominating contests, ranked Mr. Buttigieg in second place, ahead of both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders but trailing Ms. Warren.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
