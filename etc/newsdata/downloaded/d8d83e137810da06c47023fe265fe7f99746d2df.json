The effect can be shocking - and fatal.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t hold for Range Rover\u2019s new petrol-electric hybrid which I had fun putting through its paces this week, on and off-road, and across a lake.\n\nThe car is helping the British luxury 4X4 brand shed the \u2018gas-guzzler\u2019 slur which environmentalists have thrown at it for years. What\u2019s more, this beautifully appointed Range Rover P400e plug-in hybrid has a decidedly green tinge.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nRay Massey put Range Rover\u2019s new petrol-electric hybrid through its paces this week, on and off-road, and across a lake\n\nI drove it around the Cotswolds and to Churchill\u2019s former home, Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe new Range Rover hybrid combines a frugal 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine (300HP) with an 85kW electric motor, linked to a smooth 8-speed automatic gearbox. Together they generate a total of 404 bhp which is equivalent to about four Ford Fiestas.\n\nYou can plug it in and charge it up at home (two hours and 45 minutes on the fast charger, or about 7.5 hours on a domestic plug), and it will drive for up to 31 miles in electric-power mode only at speeds of up to 85 mph, after which point the petrol engine kicks in.\n\nBut it\u2019s such a smooth operator and the switch from petrol to electric is seamless. The combination of petrol and electric power means an average fuel efficiency of 101 mpg.\n\nThe new Range Rover hybrid combines a frugal 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Ingenium petrol engine (300HP) with an 85kW electric motor, linked to a smooth 8-speed automatic gearbox\n\nThe new 4x4 will drive for up to 31 miles in electric-power mode only at speeds of up to 85 mph, after which point the petrol engine kicks in\n\nYou can plug the new Range Rover in and charge it up at home.

It\u2019s not infallible, however, and even I came unstuck at one slimy stretch where it slid like a bear on ice.\n\nIt\u2019ll wade through up to 3ft of water, though you do need to fire up the engine to provide back-pressure to avoid water being sucked inside the exhaust.\n\nLand Rover reckons this is \u2018the ultimate in silent luxury\u2019. But engineers working with the Guide Dogs For The Blind Association have created a synthesised sound to alert pedestrians.\n\nIt accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 6.4 seconds with a top speed of 137mph. Inside, luxurious touches include heated and cooled massage front seats and a 10in infotainment system for rear passengers.\n\nThere is a catch, however. This car is not cheap. Prices for the Range Rover plug-in hybrid start from \u00a386,965 in Vogue trim level, up to \u00a393,465 for the Vogue SE and \u00a3105,865 for the Autobiography.\n\nRange Rover's P400e accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 6.4 seconds with a top speed of 137mph\n\nPrices for the Range Rover plug-in hybrid start from \u00a386,965 in Vogue trim level, up to \u00a393,465 for the Vogue SE and \u00a3105,865 for the Autobiography\n\nTaking the plunge: Range Rover\u2019s new P400e hybrid can cope with 3ft of water\n\n***\n\nI\u2019ll be sad to part with my diesel Honda CR-V this month after a year of sterling service.\n\nIts gutsy 1.6-litre i-DTEC engine and four-wheel drive proved a godsend in the latest cold snap as I drove it up to the Midlands through snow, ice and severe weather warnings.\n\nShame that Honda\u2019s phasing out the diesel in its next generation CR-V, replacing it with a petrol-electric hybrid. It\u2019ll be missed.\n\n***\n\nMotorists face huge differences in the cost of updating in-car sat navs, says magazine Auto Express.\n\nOwners of older Subarus can pay more than \u00a3300, while those with newer models will be charged \u00a3100 once their three free upgrades run out.\n\nThose with first generation Jaguar XFs can pay up to \u00a3316. Volvo and Volkswagen now offer lifetime updates on their latest models.\n\nRays says he'll be sad to part with his diesel Honda CR-V this month after a year of sterling service\n\n***\n\nVarekai - a Romany word meaning \u2018wherever\u2019 and used in an acrobatic production by Cirque du Soleil - is the name chosen by Aston Martin for the production version of its forthcoming new family-friendly SUV, codenamed \u2018DBX\u2019 , to be built in Wales.\n\nSleek: The new Aston Martin family-friendly Verekai model is to be built in Wales\n\n***\n\nDrivers face a postcode lottery when it comes to the cost of motoring, with those in the West Midlands hit hardest.\n\nThe total cost of fuel, insurance and maintenance adds up to an average of \u00a31,944 per year, says independent car buying site Carwow. Those in the West Midlands pay \u00a3177 more than the average - \u00a32,121 per year, followed by the North West (\u00a32,093), and London (\u00a32,038).\n\n\n\n", "description": "Never mix electricity and water, we are warned from an early age.
