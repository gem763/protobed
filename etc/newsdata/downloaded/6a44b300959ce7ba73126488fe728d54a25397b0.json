I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared for the results,\u201d he told The Sunday Telegraph. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about that because I think we\u2019re close to finding it and making some announcements.\u201d\n\nNasa\u2019s rover Mars 2020 will drill into rock formations on the planet before sending test-tubes of rock samples back to Earth \u2013 the first time material from Mars will have been brought onto this planet.\n\nDr Green added that the discovery of life on Mars will give scientists a new set of questions to explore.\n\n\u201cWhat happens next is a whole new set of scientific questions. Is that life like us? How are we related?\u201d he said. \u201cCan life move from planet-to-planet or do we have a spark and just the right environment and that spark generates life \u2013 like us or do not like us \u2013 based on the chemical environment that it is in?\u201d\n\nRecent research has shown that planets which were previously thought to be uninhabitable may have once had suitable conditions for life.\n\nEarlier this year, scientists discovered that there may be a vast and active system of water running underneath the surface of Mars.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
