While we can\u2019t get to everything \u2014 like Ben Roethlisberger being fined $5,000 for wearing an Apple Watch and Jay Gruden being canned by the Washington Redskins \u2014 here are five of the top storylines to emerge following Week 5, and whether we\u2019re buying or selling on \u2019em.\n\nBuy: Atlanta Falcons are the NFL\u2019s most disappointing team\n\nOn Sunday, the Atlanta Falcons lost 53-32 to the Houston Texans to drop their record on the season to 1-4. The 53 points the team surrendered were the third most points given up by a team this season, right behind the Dolphins (59 to Ravens) and Rams (55 to Bucs).\n\nFor the season, the Falcons have given up the second most points in the league (152), behind only the winless Dolphins (163), and rank near the bottom of the league in point differential amongst winless teams like the Bengals, Redskins and Jets.\n\nIt is a horrendous start for a team that is only a few years removed from ever-so-nearly winning the Super Bowl and has most of its roster from that playoff run intact and healthy, including quarterback Matt Ryan, wide receiver Julio Jones, running back Devonta Freeman and tight end Austin Hooper.\n\nUnder coach Dan Quinn, the Falcons have only gone 18-19 in the regular season since appearing in Super Bowl LI, and it seems the changes he made this offseason \u2014 including parting ways with all three of Atlanta\u2019s coordinators \u2014 have been ineffective.\n\nDespite that, Atlanta still somewhat controls its own destiny, as the Falcons still have all six of their divisional games against the NFC South on the schedule. Atlanta would probably need to win at least five of those six games and only lose one other game to sniff the playoffs. Given how the team has played to start this season, that\u2019s not a likely scenario.\n\nNext up, the team travels to Arizona to take on a Cardinals team that, at 1-3-1, actually has a better record than Atlanta. If the Falcons lose that, look out.\n\n(On an unrelated note, the 53-32 final margin in Atlanta\u2019s loss on Sunday represents the first time in pro football history that particular score has been accomplished. Unique scores in the NFL are popularly known as \u201cscorigami,\u201d a term coined by Jon Bois.)\n\nSell: Dwayne Haskins will solve the Redskins\u2019 QB issue\n\nWhile new Washington coach Bill Callahan has yet to announce who will start at quarterback for the Redskins on Sunday against the Dolphins, it seems likely first-round pick Dwayne Haskins will get the call.\n\nHaskins, who started only 14 games at Ohio State, was a favorite of Washington owner Daniel Synder coming out of college and the rumor is he forced ex-coach Jay Gruden and the rest of the Redskins\u2019 coaching staff to draft the former Buckeye.\n\nThat being the case, it\u2019s fair to wonder if Snyder named Callahan as Gruden\u2019s successor with the caveat that Haskins, who threw three interceptions in his NFL debut in Week 4, would be the starter.\n\nJabrill Peppers picks off Dwayne Haskins and takes it back 32 yards for a TD. pic.twitter.com/iFh4C505FT \u2014 NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) September 29, 2019\n\nBased on how Haskins played when he was on the field against the Giants in Week 4, he shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the starting lineup if Washington is serious about his development and wants to avoid similar mistakes to the ones they made with Robert Griffin, III.\n\nIt\u2019s true the Redskins, even by their standards, have a winnable game coming up against the Dolphins in Week 6 and that it could be nice to get Haskins some confidence against a Miami team that is giving up 40.8 points and 420 yards per game.\n\nBut even if Washington starts Haskins against the Dolphins and he excels, what does that really say about his prospects? Moreover, what if the Redskins start Haskins against Miami and he flops, as he did against the Giants and their bottom-tier defense?\n\nIt is only five weeks in, but the season is already a lost one for the Redskins. The don\u2019t need to make it worse eroding the 15th-overall pick\u2019s confidence without a good reason. Winning a game against the Miami Dolphins is not one.\n\nBuy: Christian McCaffrey is the NFL\u2019s best running back\n\nWith Saquon Barkley out with an ankle injury and Ezekiel Elliott suddenly sputtering for the Cowboys, the third member of the uppermost tier of NFL running backs, Christian McCaffrey, has stolen the spotlight and risen to a tier all his own.\n\nMcCaffrey, who has been the key piece in Carolina\u2019s three-game winning streak, rushed 19 times for 176 yards and two touchdowns and tacked on six catches on nine targets for 61 yards and another score in the Panthers\u2019 Week 5 win over the Jaguars.\n\nChristian McCaffrey goes all the way! @run__cmc\u2019s 3rd TD of the game is an 84-yard sprint! #KeepPounding #JAXvsCAR\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcfa: CBS\n\n\ud83d\udcf1: NFL app // Yahoo Sports app\n\nWatch free on mobile: https://t.co/d6meepU6Nz pic.twitter.com/e2vewdoP07 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 6, 2019\n\nDespite missing the Panthers\u2019 final few drives with cramps, McCaffrey now has 866 yards from scrimmage through the first five games of the season. To date, only Hall of Famer Jim Brown had a more prolific five-game stretch to begin the year, when he racked up 988 all-purpose yards to start the season in 1963.\n\nAveraging 117 rushing yards and 56 receiving per game, the third-year pro is on pace to hit 2,771 yards from scrimmage on the season, a mark which would break Chris Johnson\u2019s 2009 league record by 262 yards.\n\nAs long as McCaffrey, who is playing with a backup quarterback under center in Kyle Allen, keeps carrying the ball 21 times and catching six passes per game, there\u2019s no reason to think he can\u2019t do it.\n\nAnd if Cam Newton can come back healthy for the Panthers and give opposing defenses something else to worry about, the field could open up even more for McCaffrey. Considering what he\u2019s doing already, that\u2019s a scary thought.\n\nSell: The Buffalo Bills will miss the playoffs\n\nIn 38 games as the head coach of the Buffalo Bills (including one playoff game), Sean McDermott has gone an even 19-19.\n\nThe former Carolina Panthers defensive coordinator\u2019s .500 record may not look all that impressive until you consider how the coaches who recently preceded the third-year head coach on the sidelines in Buffalo have done:\n\nMike Mularkey: 14-18\n\nDick Jauron: 24-33\n\nPerry Fewell: 3-4\n\nChan Gailey: 16-32\n\nDoug Marrone: 15-17\n\nRex Ryan: 15-16\n\nJudging by those numbers, McDermott must be doing something right if he has the Bills, who are at 4-1 this season, at .500 overall during his 38-game tenure.\n\nHead coach Sean McDermott of the Buffalo Bills. (Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)\n\nTrailing only the 5-0 Patriots in the AFC, McDermott and the Bills are second in the NFL in yards allowed per game (275.0) and third in the league in points allowed per game (14.0). Those numbers will only improve when the Bills return from their Week 6 bye to take on the cellar-dwelling Miami Dolphins for the first time.\n\nFollowing that game (which will likely run their record to 5-1), Buffalo only plays three of its remaining 10 games against teams with a winning record as of Week 6.\n\nThat means that not only does McDermott have an excellent shot at ending the season with a career record as a head coach well over .500, but also that the Bills have a stellar shot at making the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. Should they do that, it\u2019ll be the first time they\u2019ve made it twice in three years since 1997-99.\n\nBuy: Russell Wilson is playing like the league MVP\n\nWith the Seattle Seahawks now 4-1 on the season following a one-point win over the Rams on Thursday Night Football last week, Russell Wilson is playing some of the best ball of his career.\n\nAlready a five-time Pro Bowler at age 30, Wilson has yet to throw a pick in 2019 and is leading the league in touchdown passes (12) and passer rating (126.3).\n\nThose numbers look even better when you see the kind of passes Wilson is completing this season. For example, see the 13-yard dime he completed to Tyler Lockett, a throw that had just a 6.3 percent completion probability, per Next Gen Stats.\n\nBest TD of the year?!\n\n\n\nRussell Wilson and Tyler Lockett with the must-see score.

Though it gets easier immediately after that (Falcons and Bucs), Wilson and the \u2018Hawks only face one team with a losing record (so far) over their final seven games.\n\nGetting past a stretch like that unscathed is the stuff MVP seasons are made of.", "description": "While we can\u2019t get to everything, here are five of the top storylines to emerge following Week 5, and whether we\u2019re buying or selling on \u2019em.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179441804-1-e1570465719289.jpg?fit=880%2C586", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
