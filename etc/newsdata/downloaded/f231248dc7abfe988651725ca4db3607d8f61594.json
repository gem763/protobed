It envisaged keeping Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the Republic of Ireland, so long as the region\u2019s political leaders agree to it every four years.\n\nBut the EU so far has pushed back, and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested Friday is a \u201creasonable\u201d deadline for Johnson to come up with revised proposals.\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson says Brexit will happen on Oct. 31Ireland says \u201creasonable\u201d to expect revised Brexit plans from U.K. by FridayFinnish Premier doesn\u2019t see solutions in time for Brexit deadlineLabour says Johnson can\u2019t circumvent law\n\nFinland Doesn\u2019t See Solutions Agreed by Oct. 31 (10:29 a.m.)\n\nFinnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne, who holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency, said he doesn\u2019t expect a proposal from Downing Street that could hold water in the two weeks before the Oct. 17-18 summit in Brussels.\n\n\u201cIt seems that Johnson has only now realized what a huge mess this is and has difficulties making a proposal that he can push through,\u201d Rinne told Germany\u2019s Welt am Sonntag newspaper. \u201cSo I fear that at the October summit, it could be more about an extension than concrete solutions.\u201d\n\nRather than risk a no-deal Brexit, Rinne said he would be prepared to consider a request to extend negotiations beyond Oct. 31.\n\nSeparately, Rinne on Saturday spoke by phone with Johnson, according to a statement from the Finnish premier. Rinne said he told his U.K. counterpart to put forward written proposals, but that the current plans don\u2019t meet EU goals of protecting the Irish peace process and EU unity or of maintaining a \"well-functioning internal market.\"\n\nBarclay Suggests U.K. Can Move in Talks (10 a.m.)\n\nBrexit Secretary Steve Barclay suggested on the BBC TV\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr\u201c show on Sunday that there is scope for the U.K. to alter its position in discussions with the European Union on the issues of customs checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the principle of consent, whereby politicians in Northern Ireland would have an effective veto over regulatory alignment with the EU.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve set out a broad landing zone,\u201d he said when asked about customs checks post-Brexit. \u201cIn the detail of the negotiation of course we can get into detail as to how operationally they work.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of consent, Barclay said the principle is \u201ckey,\u201d but that how it\u2019s done can be discussed. \u201cOf course in the mechanism as part of the intensive negotiations, we can look at that,\u201d he said.\n\nLabour Says Johnson Can\u2019t Circumvent Benn Act (9:45 a.m.)\n\nThere\u2019s no way for Boris Johnson to circumvent the law passed by Parliament requiring him to delay Brexit if he can\u2019t get a deal or approval for a no-deal Brexit through the House of Commons, Labour\u2019s shadow attorney-general, Shami Chakrabarti, told BBC TV on Sunday.\n\nThe law, known as the Benn Act, \u201cwas drafted with great care after a great deal of cooperation across the House of Commons,\u201d Chakrabarti said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very specific and explicit about personal duty on the prime minister.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Chakrabarti said Johnson speaks \u201cwith a forked tongue,\u201d making promises to a Scottish court on Friday that he would write the letter required of him by the law, and saying another thing in broadcast interviews. \u201cHe seems to have a very casual relationship with the law. He seems to think that he\u2019s above the law,\u201d she said. But, she warned that attempts to undermine an extension request would be unlawful.\n\n\u201cIf you send the letter as you are required to under the law and then seek to undermine it by other means, you have not kept faith with the law,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have not fulfilled your specific statutory duty to seek an extension. That would be unlawful conduct on his part.\u201d\n\nLatvia: EU Has Little Wiggle Room (9:30 a.m.)\n\nThe European Union has little room for maneuver in negotiating a new Brexit deal, Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said Sunday in a BBC television interview, while adding that he thinks a deal can be done by Oct. 31.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson doubled down on his pledge to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a deal if necessary, two days after it emerged he\u2019d promised to obey a law forcing him to send a letter requesting a delay if he can\u2019t get an agreement with the bloc.The U.K. premier\u2019s", "authors": ["Alex Morales"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AQCubXk7r627rgyG8Pjy0A--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/09934c81be0e612b36a03d01d9f94cb7", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
