Yet looking through their October statement suggests that an easing bias remains, which leaves room for another cut this year. If markets agree, we could see some bearish follow through in due course.\n\nAfter an initially lacklustre reaction, has now sliced through key support and on track for a bearish outside day. Not helping of course is the stronger USD which has seen DXY hit its highest level since May 2017. From here, bears could target the YTD lows and intraday bears could seek short setups whilst price action remains below prior support around 0.6740. A solid upside break of the bearish channel and / or the current four-hour candle high invalidates the bearish bias.\n\nremains reluctant to break out of compression, although the current four-hour candle is the most volatile in the entire range.
