And like so many sailors before me, those notions made me enlist in the U.S. Navy when I was just 17 years old.\n\nUnlike the mostly good experiences I encountered at sea, many modern-day sailors suffer the hardships of hunger, disease and brutality while working on fishing boats and other craft around the world. Some are virtual prisoners on boats and ships, and some have been murdered.\n\nIan Urbina, an investigative reporter for The New York Times, offers a collection of fascinating and often lamentable stories that chronicle how life on the vast oceans of the world is largely ungoverned.\n\nMr. Urbina offers stories of traffickers, smugglers, pirates and other criminals who take to the sea and ply their criminal trades often beyond the reach of international and national laws.\n\nOften placing himself often in harm\u2019s way, Mr. Urbina for five years gained access to many ships and boats that operated way out to sea off foreign shores. He also embedded with the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nMr. Urbina tells us that he was enchanted by the sea and five years into a doctoral program in history and anthropology at the University of Chicago, he left his studies and a cold Chicago and traveled to Singapore for a temporary job as a deckhand and resident anthropologist on a marine research ship. The ship never left port due to paperwork issues, but Mr. Urbina got to know the crews from the ships docked nearby.\n\n\u201cThis stranded stint port side in Singapore offered my first real exposure to merchant seafarers and long-haul fishermen, and the experience left me riveted by what seemed like a transient tribe of people,\u201d Mr. Urbina writes. \u201cThese workers are largely invisible to anyone leading a landlocked lifestyle. They have their own lingo, etiquette, superstitions, social hierarchy, codes of discipline, and, based on the stories they told me, catalog of crimes and tradition of impunity. Theirs is a world where lore holds as much sway as law.\u201d\n\nMr. Urbina opens the book with a story of a sea chase in Antarctica in 2014 between the Bob Barker, a ship belonging to Sea Shepard, an international, non-profit marine wildlife conservation organization, and a fishing trawler called the Thunder.\n\nChecking his binder that held Interpol\u2019s Purple Notice list of the world\u2019s worst maritime fishing scofflaws and the telltale silhouettes of the vessels, the captain of the Bob Barker found the profile of the Thunder, a Nigerian-flagged 220-foot fishing trawler.\n\nThe captain, Peter Hammarstedt, whom Mr. Urbina noted that he looked more like Howdy Doody than Blackbeard, was a serious young man and calm in a crisis. For Sea Shepard, the pursuit of the Thunder was about adding teeth to the halfhearted policing of laws on the high seas.\n\n\u201cFor bad actors like the Thunder, the seas were a vast free-for-all. Largely hidden in the sheer expanse of the world\u2019s ocean, poachers had little reason to look over their shoulders,\u201d Mr. Urbina explains. \u201cOffshore, laws were as murky as the watery boundaries are blurry, and most governments had neither the resources nor the interest to go chasing after them\u201d\n\nAt the time, Mr. Urbina notes, Interpol\u2019s Purple List consisted only six rogue ships. The ships had evaded capture for decades and were called the \u201cBandit 6.\u201d According to Mr. Urbina, Capt. Hammarstedt and his sea-going vigilantes were doing the perilous police work that governments would not. The Bob Barker did not have the authority to arrest anyone, but they pursued the Thunder and reported the ship\u2019s location to Interpol.\n\nThis was the longest pursuit of an illegal fishing vessel in nautical history. Over 110 days, across more than 11,550 nautical miles, three oceans and two seas.\n\n\u201cThe cat-and-mouse pursuit of the Thunder would take Sea Shepard\u2019s crew through an unforgiving obstacle course of stadium-sized ice sheets, a ferocious storm, violent clashes and a near collision,\u201d Mr. Urbina writes.\n\nAnother interesting story is about a sea-going repo man, who used semi-legal means and trickery to repossess ships, much in the same manner as a repo man repossess cars. But, as one can imagine, repossessing a ship in port or at sea is a good deal more complicated.\n\n\u201cThe Outlaw Ocean\u201d is an interesting and illuminating story about crime on the seas around the world.\n\n\u2022 Paul Davis covers crime, espionage and terrorism.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nTHE OUTLAW OCEAN: JOURNEYS ACROSS THE LAST UNTAMED FRONTIER\n\nBy Ian Urbina\n\nKnopf, $30, 544 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
