If there is no change in market sentiment in regard to the trade war, it's hard to see a big recovery in China's car market,\" said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities.\n\n\"So on the supply side, it is very, very difficult. There must be some consolidation there going forward among lithium miners.\"\n\nAustralia accounts for about half of the world's lithium from hard rock lithium concentrate, called spodumene, which is shipped mainly to China for processing.\n\nChina's biggest lithium producer, Ganfeng Lithium Co , a large buyer of spodumene, posted a 59% plunge in first-half profit last week, and said it expected prices of Australian hard rock lithium to fall further. in Australian miners such as Mineral Resources , Galaxy Resources , Altura Mining , Lithium Australia , and Pilbara are down between 15% and 68% this year compared with a 20% fall in the price of spodumene.\n\n\"The outlook in regards to the market remains very soft,\" Galaxy Resources chief executive Simon Hay told an earnings call last week, pointing to rising stockpiles.\n\nConverters of hard rock lithium into battery chemicals in China were holding around four months' worth of stocks, or double usual levels, he said.\n\nThis has slowed sales from overseas suppliers. Galaxy sold 44,630 tonnes in the first half of 2019, against more than 90,000 tonnes a year earlier, at an average price of $584, down from $940 a year ago.\n\nPilbara Minerals has lowered its capital expenditure in a bid to cut costs and scaled back new development projects. Mining was put on a temporary trading halt on Friday after falling as much as 30% over two days, but said it was experiencing strong sales and pointed to the general market weakness.\n\nFurther out, however, broker Canaccord said it has cut back its forecasts for annual spodumene concentrate production by around 30% to 2025.\n\n\"Challenging concentrate market conditions have driven numerous operators to reassess production plans,\" it said.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2k7fjv3 Australian lithium producers see shares prices slump in line with China lithium price\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2kaR4Mz\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "Australian lithium miners submerged by low prices", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg"}
