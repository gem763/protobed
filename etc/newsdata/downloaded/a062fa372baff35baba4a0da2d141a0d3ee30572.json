(Mahlatse Mahlase, News24)\n\nShortly after 07:00 on May 6, two days before the 2019 general elections, Jonathan Moakes and Paul Boughey were sitting in the middle of the DA\u2019s operations room at Nkululeko House, in Bruma in the east of Johannesburg, directing the last 24 hours of frantic canvassing, planning and crisis management.\n\nThe operations room was the nerve centre of the DA\u2019s election campaign and Moakes, the campaign manager, and Boughey, the campaign chairman, were in charge of the blue machine.\n\nSitting in front of screens connecting the ops room to other centres across the country, Moakes and Boughey led the morning meeting, with different team leaders reporting back about media coverage, providing opposition research, detailing the day\u2019s deployment of political principals and planning last minute surges in closely contested wards.\n\nThey were sitting at a pod in the centre of the room, with clusters of tables arranged in pods around them, different stations in charge of different operational teams. There were screens showing social media activity, latest polling numbers and Skype connections.\n\nBoughey chaired the meeting and Moakes gave the orders, telling the logistics team leader where senior party representatives should be deployed to, how the social media team should react to attacks and querying polling numbers. Boughey made sure Moakes had access to the necessary resources. There was tension and banter.\n\nMoakes and Boughey were part of the professionalisation of the DA which gathered pace around a decade ago. With the DA taking over the City of Cape Town in 2006 and then the Western Cape in 2009, the party\u2019s operations grew exponentially, and a cohort of idealistic youngsters were recruited to run the party\u2019s backroom operations.\n\nMoakes eventually became the DA\u2019s CEO \u2013 an unusual position for a political party \u2013 while Boughey served as chief of staff to the party leader and later worked for the provincial government, before he returned to take over from Moakes, who was regarded as a similar operator as Ryan Coetzee, the party\u2019s original wonder kid.\n\nTogether Moakes and Boughey oversaw building on the success of the 2014 general and 2016 municipal elections, the results of which gave the party its best foundation from where to mount an electoral assault.\n\nBut sitting on their swivel chairs in the middle of the DA\u2019s high-tech ops room, with staff scurrying about, both Moakes and Boughey were concerned about what lay ahead. They understood what was at stake and were under no illusions of the challenges internal ructions presented ahead of such a crucial poll. The Patricia de Lille spat hurt the party in the Western Cape, there was policy incoherence and serious tension among the leadership and Moakes and Boughey had to play the cards they were dealt.\n\nThe election results were a disaster for the DA. It lost hundreds of thousands of votes, was thumped in areas where it traditionally held sway and made no impression on black voters. For the first time since 1994 it lost ground.\n\nMoakes resigned shortly after, and Boughey resigned on Thursday. They ran the election campaign with the support and under the guidance of Mmusi Maimane, the party leader, who is under the most internal pressure he has ever been.\n\nThe party\u2019s federal council will this weekend meet to deliberate on the party review conducted by Coetzee \u2013 who masterminded the DA's growth a decade ago \u2013 and Tony Leon, who led the party from obscurity to opposition. It will also elect a new chairperson of the federal council, a position second only to the party leader.\n\nThe election of the chairperson will be a bellwether to see what Maimane\u2019s position in the party is. The Leon-Coetzee Report apparently recommends that the party should elect a new leader and that there should be major changes in the leadership.\n\nWith both Moakes and Boughey gone, Maimane and his supporters might well argue that the architects of the party\u2019s miserable election results are gone, and that it presents an opportunity to redesign and realign the organisation.\n\nBut sharp as they are, Moakes and Boughey were officials, party bureaucrats limited and confined by the course set by the party leader.\n\nThere is zero chance of the party acquiescing to the reported Leon-Coetzee recommendations about Maimane.\n\nPerhaps Moakes\u2019 and Boughey\u2019s self-immolation was what the leadership wanted.\n\nIt remains to be seen if that is what the party needed.", "description": "The brains-trust behind the DA's 2019 election campaign, Jonathan Moakes and Paul Boughey, have both resigned. Will it be enough of a sacrifice ahead of the party leadership's meeting this weekend? And will Mmusi Maimane use their sacrifice to his advantage?", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7227/d5595784f2d84a1baa6d54cfe7c959af.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
