Here\u2019s what they said.\n\nArt that\u2019s hung too high or too low: To find the right height to hang art, New York designer Celerie Kemble says to pretend the piece of art is a mirror and see where you\u2019d want your face to be in the reflection. \u201cYour art should be looking at you in the eye like someone who would be shaking your hand,\u201d Kemble said.\n\nAD\n\nColored matting: \u201cNever pick out a color from a piece of art to use for the matting color; it\u2019s distracting. Matting should be neutral and just disappear,\u201d Feldman says. \u201cArt looks best framed against a shade of white.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBadly hung curtains: Decorator Betsey Mosby, based in Jackson, Miss., says her biggest decorating peeve is curtains that are not hung appropriately. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to hang the rod right above the window molding and have the rod only extend to the edge of the windows.\u201d Instead Mosby hangs the rod directly below the crown molding (unless the room has unusually tall ceilings, in which case she raises the rod a couple of feet above the window). \u201cI also extend the rod past the windows horizontally so that when the curtain is open and stacked, it is not overlapping the window.\u201d The overall treatment makes the window seem larger.\n\nFeldman also hates curtains that are too short or too puddled on the floor. \u201cI like my curtains to fall like nicely tailored pants,\u201d breaking a half-inch onto the floor.\n\nAD\n\nUnlined curtains: Mosby says they are \u201cthe worst.\u201d \u201cThere are very few occasions that call for no lining on window treatments. Lining gives the appropriate weight and feel to your curtains.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nToo-small rugs: For Dallas designer Jean Liu, walking into a room and seeing all the furniture crammed onto an area rug that\u2019s too small is her No. 1 pet peeve. \u201cI recommend getting rugs that are appropriately scaled for each room.\u201d She says to leave six to 12 inches of floor showing around the perimeter of the rug. \u201cIt\u2019s a balance between wanting to see enough of the floor, especially if it\u2019s a nice species of hardwood, knowing if there are floor vents and either avoiding or cutting around them, and determining if your rug will need to involve seams, and if so, where they should be placed.\u201d\n\nHouston-based decorator Paloma Contreras concurs. \u201cThere are few design crimes as bad as having a little postage stamp for a rug in the center of your room.\u201d Contreras says to always opt for the largest rug your room can accommodate. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to makes sure that at least two of the legs on each piece of furniture are on the rug, but optimally, every piece will sit completely on top of the rug, except for the dining room, where all of the legs must be on top of the rug with at least three inches beyond the edge of the dining table.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRugs layered on carpet: For Jeffry Weisman of San Francisco\u2019s design firm Fisher Weisman Brugioni, area rugs layered on top of wall-to-wall carpeting is a major pet peeve. \u201cWe hate it, but sometimes you have to do it. In that case, we use sisal wall-to-wall, which reads more like hardwood floor than carpet and then we float the area rugs on top.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPoor furniture placement: Kemble dislikes when furniture is set up so that everyone is facing one direction (usually toward a screen). \u201cLiving rooms should be set up for conversation. Place the chairs and sofa in relation to one another as if they were friends at a party and were chatting.\u201d\n\nContreras warns: \u201cDon\u2019t push all of the furniture up against the walls. Your living room should feel inviting and should be conducive to conversation. It\u2019s not a middle school dance!\u201d She says to \u201cfloat\u201d at least one substantial piece in the room.\n\nAD\n\nUninspired furniture shapes: New York stylist and designer Olga Naiman dislikes when everything is square or rectangular in a room. \u201cIt\u2019s becomes one dimensional and uninteresting. You need to mix it up by adding circular or amorphous shapes.\u201d\n\nBad lighting: Bad interior lighting bothers Tatyana Miron Ahlers, a partner in the New York design firm Pappas Miron, the most. \u201cLighting in any room makes all the difference, but when entertaining, low and even light is crucial.\u201d She says to avoid compact fluorescent lights at all costs and instead buy LED bulbs that have the \u201cwarmest\u201d temperature, usually 2700K. She also suggests stocking up on 60 watt incandescent bulbs to use at dinner parties or holidays.\n\nAD\n\nVisible cords: Kemble hates it when people miss simple chances to hide electrical cords. She says to tape them under tables or use twist-ties to conceal them.\n\nAD\n\nCottage cheese ceilings: Weisman (and just about every other designer in the world) dislikes those outdated textured ceilings he calls \u201ccottage cheese ceilings,\u201d though you may know them as popcorn ceilings. Use quarter-inch Sheetrock to cover it, which he says is more cost-effective than scraping. \u201cAlso, we have been told that the old acoustical coating sometimes contains asbestos, in which case it\u2019s safer to bury it than scrape it.\u201d\n\nSad, flat pillows that came with the couch: Feldman doesn\u2019t like throw pillows that aren\u2019t full enough. She advised to always go up a size with inserts, so if you have an 18-by-18-inch pillowcase. you should get a 20-by-20 insert. And Mosby says to replace any throw pillows that come with your sofa. \u201cYou should always customize them to one or two different patterns to add interest, texture and scale.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMayhew, a \u201cToday\u201d show style expert and former magazine editor, is the author of \u201cFlip! for Decorating.\u201d\n\nMore from Lifestyle:\n\nAD", "description": "They\u2019re probably judging your curtain choices.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Mayhew"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aKf2EAvv5Y0RXButy-1KTJKTp6Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H6IZWDHMHQI6TBOAQWQJRZD3G4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
