Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) expressed unease with President Donald Trump\u2019s graphic description of a U.S. military raid that resulted in the death of so-called Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who Trump said was \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming\u201d before detonating a suicide vest that killed himself and three of his children Saturday.\n\nThornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, suggested on Sunday that he would have worded the announcement differently.\n\n\u201cIt probably makes me a little uncomfortable to hear a president talking that way, but, again, Baghdadi was the inspirational leader for an ISIS network across the world from Africa to Southeast Asia,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cIf you can take a little of the glamour off him, if you can make him less inspirational, then there\u2019s a value to that for all of these folks who are on their computers or in these networks looking to attack.\u201d\n\nHowever, Thornberry warned that the terror organization is now likely to \u201cseek to do something to show \u2018we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re still relevant,\u2019 so the United States is going to be tested in the days to come.\u201d\n\nIn a cryptic tweet Saturday night, Trump declared, \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d revealing in a press conference the following morning that Baghdadi had died.\n\nThe president vividly portrayed the operation as having been carried out \u201cin grand style\u201d as canines chased Baghdadi into a dead-end tunnel where he ignited his vest.\n\n\u201cThe thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him,\u201d Trump said, adding that Baghdadi \u201cdied like a dog\u201d and \u201clike a coward.\u201d\n\nThornberry, who is set to retire at the end of his term, had previously offered measured scrutiny of Trump\u2019s handling of foreign policy and national security, publicly opposing the president\u2019s 2018 plan to pull U.S. troops out of Syria as \u201ca strategic error.\u201d\n\nHe has not, however, clearly stood against Trump\u2019s latest move to withdraw troops, which left Kurdish forces fighting ISIS open to attack from Turkey.\n\nIn a press conference last week, Thornberry only went as far as noting that ISIS is still a threat, adding, \u201cWe can criticize the president\u201d and place sanctions on Turkey, \u201cbut the number one thing Congress needs to do is its job.\u201d", "description": "In the graphic account of the so-called Islamic State leader's death, the president described him as having been \"whimpering and crying and screaming.\u201d", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db5de59200000da29506eb6.jpeg?cache=ggb2bf5p0i&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
