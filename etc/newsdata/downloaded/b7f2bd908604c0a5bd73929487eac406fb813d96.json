(AP) - Antonio Brown had a stellar debut with the New England Patriots.\n\nWhether he will have an opportunity for a repeat performance this week will be up to the NFL.\n\nBrown led the Patriots with four catches for 56 yards and a touchdown during New England\u2019s 43-0 win over of the Miami Dolphins on Sunday .\n\nNow as the Patriots prepare to host the New York Jets this week, Brown and the team must again wait and see if looming sexual assault and rape allegations against him will make him subject to discipline under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy.\n\nOn Monday, the NFL declined to comment on when was meeting with Britney Taylor, a former trainer of Brown who filed a civil lawsuit in Florida last week alleging he sexually assaulted her on three occasions between 2017 and 2018. But the league told the Patriots last week that it planned to open an investigation into the matter.\n\nBrown has denied the allegations made in the lawsuit. Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown, told The Associated Press his client plans to countersue.\n\nSports Illustrated also published a story Monday afternoon in which a second woman, an unnamed artist, alleged that Brown exposed himself to her while she was working on a mural for him at his Pittsburgh. Brown also denied those allegations through his attorney.\n\nBrown has yet to address reporters and was not made available following the Patriots\u2018 win over the Miami.\n\nTwo sources told The Associated Press that Brown was able to play last week because no criminal charges have been filed against him and because the league hadn\u2019t fully developed its investigation.\n\nThat could change this week if the league has a chance to speak with one or both of his accusers.\n\nAsked during his Monday morning conference call if he expected to hear from the league about Brown\u2019s availability this week, coach Bill Belichick said, \u201cI\u2019ll just answer any questions about the game, and I\u2019m not getting into anything else outside of that right now.\u201d\n\nWhat is clear is that Brown\u2019s presence on the field adds a new dimension to the Patriots\u2018 offense.\n\nSeveral times during its blowout of Miami, the Patriots used four-wide receiver formations with Brown and Josh Gordon lined up outside and Julian Edelman and Phillip Dorsett on the inside. The foursome combined to catch 13 of Tom Brady\u2019s 28 completions.\n\nBrown\u2019s teammates maintain that the off-field issues that have engulfed Brown haven\u2019t been a distraction to him on the field.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us had any doubts about A.B.\u2019s skillset,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cI think it was just good for everybody to see it in an actual game. He continues to be who we expect him to be, and that\u2019s a great wide receiver and a good football player.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S WORKING\n\nThe offense. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels has done a masterful job thus far is mixing up personnel groups and his play calling to take the pressure off his 42-year-old quarterback. The presence of Gordon and now Brown has also helped mask the absence of retired tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThrough two games the offense is averaging 6.4 yards per play and has one turnover.\n\nWHAT NEEDS HELP\n\nThe one caveat to the Patriots\u2018 offensive dominance over the first two games is on the offensive line, which continues to fight through injuries. Right tackle Marcus Cannon was active but did not play as recovers from a shoulder injury. Marshall Newsome, who was signed last week, started in Cannon\u2019s place.\n\nThe line suffered another injury in the first quarter. Left tackle Isaiah Wynn, who was sidelined last season with an Achilles tendon issue, left the game with a foot injury and did not return. He was replaced by Korey Cunningham, acquired in a trade with Arizona late last month.\n\nSTOCK UP\n\nSony Michel. The second-year running back isn\u2019t showing any drop-off from his rookie season. He had the game\u2019s first touchdown and carried 21 times for 85 yards to lead all rushers.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nKicker Stephen Gostkowski had a rough day against the Dolphins, missing a pair of extra points and a 48-yard field goal. It marked only the third time in his career he has missed an extra-point and field goal in the same game.\n\nINJURED\n\nWynn was expected to undergo further testing on his foot on Monday.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n76 - The Patriots have outscored their opponents 76-3 in their first two games. The 76 points are tied for the most in team history along with the 2007 team. That team finished the season with 589 points, the second most in the Super Bowl era.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nThe Patriots continue their AFC East schedule with a visit from the Jets. They will get their first look at running back Le\u2019Veon Bell with his new team.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Antonio Brown had a stellar debut with the New England Patriots.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/patriots_dolphins_football_73346_c0-1322-2885-3004_s1770x1032.jpg?b0b6c278d94e5c5e5ab61e1448b5cec207d479c4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
