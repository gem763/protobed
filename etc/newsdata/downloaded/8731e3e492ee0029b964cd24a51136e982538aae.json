(Now I want to kill you)\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU\n\nDon't be fooled, this isn't a friendly greeting between a gentoo penguin and a leopard seal.\n\nWe know the gentoos are cute, the gentoos know they're cute but the seals like nothing more than dismembering and devouring a couple for their tea.\n\nThree perfect floofs\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Abigail Lees\n\nGrey-headed albatross chicks don't just sit on nests like these to look cool, they keep them off the wet ground below.\n\nIf they fall out of the nest and can't get back in, the chicks can freeze to death - which sounds about right for an Attenborough series.\n\nWe're still not over what happened with the barnacle goslings - and they tumbled (some to their death) onto our screens way back in 2014.\n\nThe snub-nosed crew\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Nick Green\n\nOh sure, these snub nosed monkeys from Eastern China look cute now, but just wait until the teeth and claws come out.\n\nBonus: This is a baby snub\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Nick Green\n\nSomething awful's going to happen to this little guy, isn't it?\n\nA firm 'no'\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Espen Rekdal\n\nStarfish are hard to love with their lack of a brain and weird eating habits, but stick a massive sea spider (the size of a dinner plate, we're led to believe) on top and we're out. Sorry boys.\n\nThat's more like it\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Julian Rad\n\nThis is a European hamster and he probably deserves his own spin-off series because this guy has one hell of a back-story.\n\nThe ones we'll see in Seven Worlds, One Planet live in graveyards in Vienna and have been in the area for decades, but now live among the dead because development has robbed them of the meadows they used to inhabit.\n\nHonestly BBC bosses, commission this.\n\n'We used to be fun, Jeremy'\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Mark MacEwen\n\nThe blank, exhausted expressions of parents with young children everywhere.\n\nThese guys are guanaco\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Chadden Hunter\n\nSimilar to a llama, guanaco are handy for their fur and not without their charm.\n\nPetflix and chill\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/John Brown\n\nSure, this seal pup looks cute to you, but show this to a penguin and he'll have a thing or two to say.\n\nSo terrible, they named him (horribly) twice\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Emma Napper\n\nKnown to people in Australia (where they live in the desert) as the thorny devil, the scientific name for these spiky reptiles is Moloch horridus - which isn't much nicer.\n\nThe man, the myth\n\nImage copyright BBC NHU/Alex Board\n\nName a cooler 93-year-old.\n\nWe'll wait.\n\nSeven Worlds, One Planet starts on BBC One on Sunday 27 October at 6.15pm.\n\nIf you want more to get you in the mood, here's the official trailer.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "And yes, some of these guys will no doubt meet a horrible end in the BBC's new nature documentary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/175C3/production/_109338659_sevenworlds976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
