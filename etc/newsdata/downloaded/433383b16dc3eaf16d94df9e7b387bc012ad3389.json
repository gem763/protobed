We will be revealing 20 players per day, starting with the players who ranked 100-81. 2/21 100. Yaya Toure A brilliant midfielder who had everything: skill, tenacity, power, goals, energy. His defensive capabilities brought him to the fore at Barcelona before his attacking prowess made him such a weapon for Manchester City. He won two Ligas, three Premier Leagues, one Champions League, captained Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations and was African Player of the Year four times. LO Getty Images 3/21 99. Harry Kane His raw statistics are simply phenomenal. 130 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur, in just 186 appearances. 27 in 42 for England. Twice a Premier League Golden Boot winner. A World Cup Golden Boot winner. Tottenham\u2019s talisman. England\u2019s captain. And still just 26 years old. In 10 years\u2019 time, expect to see Kane in the top 20 of a similar list. LB Getty Images 4/21 98. Daniele De Rossi A ferociously competitive and combative midfield hard man, who made over 600 appearances for his beloved Roma and over 100 for his national team. A complete midfielder, who could in one passage of play win the ball, race forward and either release a team-mate with a pinpoint pass or score himself. And do not be fooled by his combustible reputation: in 2016, he placed his treasured World Cup winner's medal in the coffin of Pietro Lombardi, Italy\u2019s kit man at the tournament. LB AFP/Getty Images 5/21 97. Bastian Schweinsteiger The meticulous German orchestrated Bayern Munich's midfield to eight Bundesliga titles and a Champions League, making over 500 appearances for the club. He was also one of the leaders in Germany's 2014 World Cup-winning campaign and carried an aura in the centre of the pitch few players can claim to have replicated. TK Bongarts/Getty Images 6/21 96. Vincent Kompany It\u2019s difficult to define his importance to both Manchester City and Belgium but it\u2019s safe to say he was one of the most important players of a generation. There may well be a handful of technically better centre-backs but his intangibles were vital to the culture at club and country where there was not a legacy of winning previously. JR Getty Images 7/21 95. Karim Benzema One of the few strikers on this list who can truly claim to be the complete forward, able to play wide or central, deep linking play or on the shoulder of the last defender, with the ability to sniff out scrappy goals and score beauties too. His medal haul speaks for itself, and he is approaching 300 career goals. But for his strained relationship with the French national team, he would have scored even more. LO Getty Images 8/21 94. Sol Campbell The heartbeat of Arsenal's defence in the Invincibles season, a double-winner in 2002 and a mainstay of the England team for almost a decade, Campbell is one of the defining defensive figures of the Premier League era. TK AFP/Getty Images 9/21 93. Pepe One of the great villains of the game but a nasty, hard centre-back that would be very high on any great striker\u2019s list of defenders he least wanted to play against. While his grit and determination stand out, nobody lasts a decade at the Bernabeu without possessing exceptional quality, with three La Liga titles (which has eluded the club since his departure) and as many Champions Leagues, Zinedine Zidane would be wise to acquire a similar player now. JR Getty Images 10/21 92. Edwin van der Sar The four-time Premier League winner made over 300 appearances in England and made an enduring habit of thriving under pressure, winning the man-of-the-match award in Manchester United's Champions League final victory in 2008. TK Getty Images 11/21 91. Arturo Vidal Only the finest players in the world enjoy long and fruitful stints at clubs such as Juventus, Bayern Munich and Barcelona. Il Guerriero has matured into a splendid holding midfielder, aggressive and dominant in the middle of the pitch but equally as effective arriving late into the box to complete attacks. A hero in his native Chile, for his role in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica victory. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 12/21 90. Angel di Maria A key player in the glorious Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 2011/12 and the Champions League two seasons later. Widely considered a flop when he left Manchester United after only one miserable season, but the Argentine completely reinvented himself at Paris Saint-Germain, the starring attraction in one of the most expensive squads ever assembled, containing the likes of Neymar, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Edinson Cavani. LB AFP/Getty Images 13/21 89. Diego Forlan A figure of fun in his early Premier League days at Manchester United, Forlan went on to have the last laugh with a stellar career both internationally with Uruguay and in Spain, where he racked up goals for Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, twice winning the European Golden Shoe. LO AFP/Getty Images 14/21 88. Radamel Falcao In his pomp Falcao was probably the best striker on the planet. In a prolific four-year spell playing for Porto and Atletico Madrid he scored 142 goals in 178 games, and had injuries not hindered his career there is little doubt that Colombia's record scorer would be much higher up this list. LO Getty Images 15/21 87. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang Has excelled in a thoroughly mediocre Arsenal side for two seasons now, scoring at a rate better than a goal every other game in a side that has struggled since the departure of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But it is primarily for his achievements at Borussia Dortmund that he makes this list. He scored close to 150 Bundesliga goals for that wonderfully attacking team \u2013 including 31 in one season \u2013 winning the Bundesliga Player of the Year and Top Goalscorer awards. There have been few strikers as rapid or as decisive in front of goal in the last two decades. LB Bongarts/Getty Images 16/21 86. Robin Van Persie One of the best left foots in Premier League history graced two of its most revered clubs, becoming a star at both Arsenal and Manchester United. The Dutchman had a penchant for the spectacular but suffered with injuries, and it is a sign of what could have been that in the two Premier League seasons he played more than 30 games, he won the Golden Boot in both. LO Getty Images 17/21 85. Carlos Tevez A real pest of a striker who thrived in the hottest atmospheres and regularly overcame adversity. He scored plenty too, 116 league goals in eight seasons with United, City and Juventus (who probably all enjoyed prime Tevez), but it was the way he would trigger his teammates by forcing the first mistake or sparking counterattacks that really made him such an invaluable player. JR Getty Images 18/21 84. Gaizka Mendieta The midfield maestro could control games and decide them too, and was at the heart of the brilliant Valencia team which reached back-to-back Champions League finals in 2000 and 2001. He became one of the most expensive players of all time when he switched to Lazio, but he would never again reach the heights that made him a legend at the Mestalla. LO Getty Images 19/21 83.

Few defenders have carried such an overarching influence on any side in recent memory. TK Getty Images 20/21 82. Hernan Crespo One of the finest finishers of a generation but perhaps his best quality was his movement; particularly in the box, where nobody was more lethal at finding a yard of space and punishing opponents.

Certainly as talented as Sergio Aguero and with perhaps more composure in the biggest occasions - an underrated player. JR AFP/Getty Images 21/21 81. Rio Ferdinand A gem of a centre-back, who was perhaps ahead of his time, right now he would be even more valuable due to his versatility to thrive under any manager, no matter the philosophy or style of play.

JR Getty Images\n\nThe move to January was also broadly welcomed as it avoids awkward clashes with either Uefa Supercup commitments or clubs\u2019s commercially important pre-season fixtures around the world. So there was no opposition to the semi-finals being played on January 8th and 9th 2020, with the final on the 12th.\n\nThe only remaining issue was where to play \u2013 which in theory meant finding out who would pay the most money for the privilege. Rubiales\u2019s idea had always been to play the expanded \u2018final four\u2019 competition outside Spain \u2013 following last season when Barcelona beat Sevilla 2-1 in Tangiers.\n\nSaudi Arabia soon emerged as most likely to host the 2019/20 version \u2013 reportedly out-bidding also-interested Qatar by offering \u20ac180 million over six years.\n\n\u201cArabia is a possibility, although it is difficult to reach \u20ac30 million [a year],\u201d said Rubiales last April. \u201cSociety is asking us for more attractive formats, with more income. We all win from this.\u201d\n\nThe new format was officially approved at an RFEF assembly later that month, and La Liga\u2019s fixture list announced in July left space in early January. But there was still no venue confirmation.\n\nIt took until recent weeks for the question of whether female supporters could attend a Supercopa hosted in the Middle East to [belatedly] enter the conversation \u2013 when a 29-year-old Iranian female fan died after setting fire to herself following her arrest for trying to watch a men\u2019s AFC Champions League match.\n\nAn investigation ordered Fifa president Gianni Infantino led directly to the much publicised [partial] permission for women to attend Iran\u2019s 2022 World Cup qualifier against Cambodia last Thursday. The Saudi authorities have since January 2018 also \u2018allowed\u2019 women and girls to see games live, however only within an area of the stadium without any men. Given this situation, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has directly asked his organisation\u2019s 55 member federations to \u201censure their teams do not play in countries where basic rights of women are not respected.\u201d\n\nThe Spanish government also entered the debate. Asked in late September what she thought of playing the Supercopa in Saudi Arabia, Spain\u2019s minister for education Isabel Celaa replied that it did not seem appropriate as: \u201cWe in Spain defend gender equality.\u201d Those comments were backed by Spain\u2019s secretary of state for sport Maria Jose Rienda. Although it was later clarified that the government would not directly interfere in RFEF matters, with concerns about human rights not having affected the two countries\u2019 close commercial ties in various non sporting areas.\n\nAtletico board spokesperson Clemente Villaverde raised another potential stumbling block when he was asked whether he would have a problem with playing the Supercopa in Saudi Arabia. \u201cWe all know the problems there are with Saudi Arabia, above all the issue of piracy, so it does not seem advisable to play there,\u201d Villaverde told Movistar TV during September\u2019s derbi against Real Madrid. \u201cWe would prefer to play the Supercopa where all rights are guaranteed, and there are no problematic attitudes or behaviours.\u201d\n\nThat was a reference to BeoutQ \u2013 a Saudi based channel which simulcasts [without permission] the signal of Beinsports, the Qatari station with rights for many sporting events including LaLiga throughout the Gulf region. The Saudi government has denied any involvement in this apparent piracy, to much anger from its Qatari counterparts, and incredulity from elsewhere.\n\nLa Liga president Javier Tebas also brought up this matter when asked about a Saudi-hosted Supercopa. \u201cFor me they can play it anywhere,\u201d Tebas said. \u201cBut anywhere except Arabia would be best \u2013 as there they are pirating the signal of the entire football industry and world sport.\u201d\n\nAs the row rumbled on without Rubiales commenting publicly, Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was reportedly prepared to act as a \u2018mediator\u2019, using Middle East contacts from his burgeoning off-the-pitch business career. Barca board spokesperson Josep Vives denied this week that Pique would have any role in deciding where the Supercopa would be played, but managed to suggest that holding the games in Saudi Arabia could actually be a positive for womens\u2019s rights in that country.\n\n\u201cChoosing the Supercopa venue is for the RFEF, not the clubs,\u201d Vives said. \u201cBut I can tell you that our foundation has been working in Saudi Arabia for some time. We are working to change things so that women can take part in sport there.\u201d\n\nReal Madrid\u2019s club foundation is also active in Saudi Arabia, where 900 boys and girls attend \u2018social-sporting\u2019 education organised in collaboration with local organisation Riyadh Schools. Madrid declined to comment on the Supercopa venue before it was decided. However, coincidentally or not, Los Blancos\u2019s travelling club museum visits Riyadh next January.\n\nValencia were the only club to publicly protest the \u2018final four in January\u2019 idea when it was first floated. Los Che club officials have more recently been quiet on the idea of Saudi hosting, perhaps distracted by more pressing matters at Mestalla during the opening weeks of the 2019/20 campaign.\n\nGenerally though, it seems the biggest concern for Rubiales and other [all male] senior figures involved is not whether women can freely attend the Supercopa games, but how to accept the attractive Saudi offer without offending their Qatari broadcast partners.\n\nRFEF sources told The Independent this week that an internal commission was still evaluating the different options, and that they alone would make the decision. They declined to enter into any debate about the morality of bringing the competition to any country, while maintaining that Rubiales\u2019 idea remained to convert the Spanish Supercopa into the most attractive possible competition within a global football context.\n\nWhat that means in practice remains to be seen. A useful option at this point could be to bypass the Middle East debate completely, with India and China also having been mooted as possible venues. For the moment though Rubiales\u2019 plan for a lucrative Spanish Supercopa revamp has been more hassle than it will be worth.", "description": "What had seemed a straightforward idea to move the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a overseas for commercial reasons has landed the Spanish football federation [RFEF] in a minefield stretching from womens\u2019s rights to global geopolitics.
