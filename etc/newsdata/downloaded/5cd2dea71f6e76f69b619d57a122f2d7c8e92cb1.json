Storyful\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 A week after the Hard Rock Hotel construction site partially collapsed along the edge of the French Quarter, the city has still not been able to demolish two massive, unstable cranes that appear to be shifting.\n\nAfter announcing Friday a scheduled demolition could not take place and the cranes would be imploded Saturday, engineers attaching explosives discovered more damage, delaying their work again. Now the earliest the towering cranes could come down would be midday Sunday.\n\n\"The cranes are more damaged than thought, so they need to do things that are a little bit safer,\" said New Orleans Fire Chief Tim McConnell.\n\nSeveral huge, concrete levels of the 18-story Hard Rock Hotel construction site on Canal Street, which divides the French Quarter and the Central Business District, partially collapsed Oct. 12, killing three workers and injuring dozens. The cause is under investigation by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New Orleans Police Department.\n\nHard Rock Hotel collapse: Work starts to bring down cranes before coming storm\n\n'Logically, it doesn't make sense': Engineer weighs in on Hard Rock Hotel collapse\n\nWorkers are raised in a crane bucket to prepare two unstable cranes for implosion at the collapse site of the Hard Rock Hotel, which underwent a partial, major collapse while under construction last Sat., Oct., 12, in New Orleans, Saturday, Oct. 19, 2019.

Their shifting concerned authorities earlier this week as a tropical system threatened to bring gusty winds. After a rush to attempt to remove the cranes before the storm's expected gusts failed Friday, the plan was to take them down Saturday.\n\nTropical Storm Nestor tracked further east than expected, making landfall in the northeast Florida Panhandle Saturday and sparing New Orleans and the vulnerable Hard Rock site any impact.\n\n'Very dangerous situation': Two dead, one still missing after Hard Rock hotel collapse\n\nMore: Tropical weather threat brings worry of further collapse to site of New Orleans hotel disaster\n\nOn Saturday under bright blue skies and milder temperatures, McConnell said one of the cranes shifted again but this time did not move back.\n\n\"That's tells me it's weakening,\" he said.\n\nThe engineers will continue to work through the night. Several hours before the implosion, the city will enforce a temporary evacuation zone around the Hard Rock site.\n\n\"As we said from the beginning, this has been a fluid operation,\" said Mayor LaToya Cantrell.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/19/hard-rock-hotel-collapse-new-orleans-crane-demolition-delayed/4038318002/", "description": "A week after the Hard Rock Hotel construction site partially collapsed, the city still hasn't been able to demolish the two shifting cranes on top.", "authors": ["Todd A.
