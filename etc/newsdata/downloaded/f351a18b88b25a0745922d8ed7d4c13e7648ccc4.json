JTC, another of Starling\u2019s existing investors, also participated, adding a further \u00a310 million.\n\nStarling says the new funding will support increased investment in its consumer and SME bank accounts, as well as its B2B banking services. The capital will also be used to accelerate expansion into Europe.\n\nLaunched in May 2017, Starling has raised \u00a3263 million to date. In February this year it disclosed a \u00a375 million funding round, and in the same month was awarded \u00a3100 million from the Capabilities and Innovation Fund, which was set up by Royal Bank of Scotland to fulfill European state aid conditions after a bailout during the financial crisis. Starling is using the CIF award to build out its SME account.\n\nMeanwhile, the challenger bank says it is very close to reaching 1 million accounts opened. The number at time of publication was 930,000 accounts, with the 1 million mark expected within a few weeks.\n\nThat isn\u2019t quite on par with competitors such as Monzo, Revolut or N26, all of which have several million opened accounts and have been growing significantly faster \u2014 even if that hyper growth isn\u2019t without problems. However, Starling has always talked up its average bank deposits number as higher than other upstarts, evidence that consumers are using new banking offerings in different ways and not always as their primary salary account.\n\nCue statement from Boden: \u201cThis latest investment of \u00a320 million from Merian Chrysalis will support Starling\u2019s rapid growth and help us reach one million customers and \u00a31 billion on deposit within weeks. It will also help us accelerate our global expansion, starting in Europe, so that even more people can benefit from the Starling app.\u201d", "description": "Starling Bank, the U.K.-based challenger bank founded by banking veteran Anne Boden, has raised an additional \u00a330 million in funding.
