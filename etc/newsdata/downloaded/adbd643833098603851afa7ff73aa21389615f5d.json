The Legislative Council has not sat since July amid protests targeting the main parliamentary building.\n\nDuring the protest in the chamber, some MPs held up placards showing Ms Lam with hands coloured blood red, while others wore masks of the Chinese president Xi Jinping.\n\nThey chanted \u201cfive demands, not one less\u201d, a reference to protesters\u2019 key stipulations including immunity from prosecution and universal suffrage. The same slogan was also projected onto the wall behind Ms Lam.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference after Ms Lam had given up and left the chamber, pro-democracy politician Tanya Chan said the chief executive was to blame for the chaos in the city that began in June.\n\n\u201cBoth her hands are soaked with blood,\u201d Ms Chan said. \u201cWe hope Carrie Lam withdraws and quits. She has no governance ability... she is not suitable to be chief executive.\u201d\n\nWhen Ms Lam did finally delivering her speech via video message, she set out key policies to address a housing crisis that her government has described as the most pressing matter the city faces.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
