(Provider: PA)\n\nMillions of office workers are at risk of suffering major health problems including hunched backs unless they make major changes immediately, experts have warned.\n\nTo illustrate the danger, a lifesize model dubbed \u2018Emma\u2019 has been produced to indicate what will happen to people who continue to batter their body for the next 20 years.\n\nMore than nine in ten British office employees are suffering from poor health due to the way they work, according to a survey by \u2018healthy workspace solutions provider\u2019 Fellowes.\n\nWilliam Higham, a behavioural expert who helped the develop the new model, warned: \u2018Employers and workers really need to act now and address the problem of poor workplace health.\n\n\u2018Workers in the future could suffer health problems as bad as those we thought we\u2019d left behind in the Industrial Revolution.\u2019\n\nBehavioural futurist William Higham and the life-sized model named \u2018Emma\u2019 (Image: PA)\n\nModern working environments cause bad backs, eye problems and other ailments (Provider: PA)\n\nIs it time to reassess your working environment?

This condition can be extremely painful and cause veins to swell up.\n\nThe best way to prevent it is to walk about every hour or so and make sure you\u2019re not sitting cross-legged or with a poor posture.\n\nIt might sound far-fetched, but it has previously been claimed that nose hair can lengthen when people are exposed to pollution, because it works to filter out bugs, chemicals and other nasties.\n\n\u2018In this world, nose hair has evolved to filter pollution.\u2019 the charity WildAid said in 2016.\n\n\u2018The message for current urban residents is clear: Change air pollution before it changes you.\u2019", "description": "Study reveals the grim effect modern workplaces are having on our health.", "authors": ["Jasper Hamill"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91520098_1571912731.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
