He\u2019s also forthright. He says what he thinks,\u201d said Patrick Kennedy, a former senior State Department official who\u2019s long known Taylor.\n\nAnother former U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was more blunt: \u201cHe\u2019s the only honorable man in this disgusting drama.\u201d\n\nTaylor declined to comment for this article. But after two weeks of rapid Ukraine-related revelations now fueling a House Democrat-led impeachment inquiry, the sudden appearance of his name jolted observers of the drama.\n\nOne of his texts in particular crystallized the concerns in Washington: \u201cAs I said on the phone,\u201d Taylor texted on Sept. 9, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nThroughout a lengthy career, Taylor has worked in several hot spots, including as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine from 2006-2009. He had been serving as the executive vice president of the U.S. Institute of Peace when he was asked to return to Kyiv after the ambassador there, Marie Yovanovitch, was pulled out early in May in circumstances House Democrats also are probing.\n\nTaylor\u2019s texts were among documents the former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations, Kurt Volker, handed over to lawmakers as part of a lengthy deposition Thursday. The text messages included conversations between Volker, Taylor and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nThey appear to show that the diplomats were aware of Trump\u2019s desire for Ukraine\u2019s new government to get involved in investigations of the U.S. president\u2019s political rivals, including events surrounding the 2016 campaign.\n\nSeparate documents since have shown that Trump specifically wanted Ukraine to look into Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company. There\u2019s no evidence that either Biden committed any wrongdoing. But Trump, and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, were nonetheless agitating for another look by Ukraine.\n\nIn the texts, Volker and Sondland in particular appear to try to make it clear to the Ukrainians that a White House visit or even a phone call with Trump would be conditioned on them agreeing to an investigation, though the exact parameters are not clear.\n\nTaylor appears wary early on. In a July 21 text, for instance, he points out to Sondland that the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenksy, \u201cis sensitive about Ukraine being taken seriously, not merely as an instrument in Washington domestic, reelection politics.\u201d\n\nSondland replies: \u201cAbsolutely, but we need to get the conversation started and the relationship built, irrespective of the pretext. I am worried about the alternative.\u201d\n\nZelensky, a former comedian, won the Ukrainian presidency in April. Given Ukraine\u2019s reliance on U.S. military assistance in its war with Russia, diplomats on both sides wanted Trump and Zelensky to establish a good rapport.\n\nA few days later, on July 25, Trump spoke to Zelensky and repeatedly pressed him to investigate the Bidens, according to a detailed call memo released by the White House. That call is at the center of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nWeeks later, after reports that the Trump administration had put on hold hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance to Ukraine, Taylor again voiced outrage.\n\n\u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d he asked in a Sept. 1 text.\n\nSondland\u2019s reply? \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nA week later, Taylor expresses frustration over what appears to be the possibility that Ukraine\u2019s president may give an interview to the press that the White House wants, but that Kyiv still might not get the military aid it is requesting.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare is they give the interview and don\u2019t get the security assistance. The Russians love it. (And I quit.),\u201d he writes.\n\nThe following day, he and Sondland have a more tense exchange:\n\n\u201cThe message to the Ukrainians (and Russians) we send with the decision on security assistance is key. With the hold, we have already shaken their faith in us. Thus my nightmare scenario,\u201d Taylor writes Sept. 9.\n\nMinutes later, he adds: \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nTo that, Sondland replies: \u201cI Believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The President has been clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\u201d He goes on to add that they should stop the texting.\n\nSome former U.S. diplomats expressed discomfort with the extensive use of texting as part of the policy-making process. They noted that it\u2019s generally preferable to use State Department email or other means so that there\u2019s a proper record kept for the future.\n\nBut others say that texting is increasingly a key tool for diplomats everywhere, including those of other countries, and that its use does not necessarily indicate ill-intent.\n\nAndrew Weiss, a Eurasia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, noted that Taylor was willing to voice his objections even though he knew that could put him at odds with Trump\u2019s political appointees and other conservative backers.\n\nHe must have known that Yovanovitch, the former ambassador, had been pulled out a few months before her tenure in Kyiv was due to end after coming under sustained attack from Giuliani and elements of the conservative media who claimed she was anti-Trump.\n\n\u201cHe was explaining that major harm was being done to U.S.-Ukraine relations,\u201d Weiss added. \u201cThat it would redound to Russia\u2019s benefit and that he wouldn\u2019t be part of it.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s diplomatic work has included coordinating U.S. government assistance for places like Iraq, Afghanistan and parts of the former Soviet Union. He has degrees from West Point and Harvard. His Army career included tours in Vietnam and Germany.\n\nA former State Department official said that after what happened to Yovanovitch, U.S. diplomats in Kyiv were happy to have a veteran like Taylor at the helm.\n\n\u201cHe was a salve for those wounds,\u201d the former official said.\n\nYovanovitch is due to give a deposition to Congress next week, as is Sondland. Given the revelations this week, Taylor might soon find himself beckoned to Capitol Hill, too.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ad/84/fab175a440ac952b957a716d2bc3/191004-william-taylor-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
