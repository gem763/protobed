Attacks May Impact Saudi Aramco IPO Valuation, Eurasia Says\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities may impact Aramco\u2019s valuation but are unlikely to derail the kingdom\u2019s plan to sell shares in the oil giant, according to the Eurasia Group.\n\n\u201cCrown Prince Mohammad bin Salman will push the company to demonstrate that it can effectively tackle terrorism or war challenges,\u201d analysts led by Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at the Eurasia Group, said in a research report. \u201cThe attacks could complicate Aramco\u2019s IPO plans given rising security risks and potential impact on its valuation.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil production was cut by half after a swarm of explosive drones struck at the heart of the kingdom\u2019s energy industry and set the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing plant ablaze -- an attack blamed on Iran by the top U.S. diplomat.\n\nThe attacks came as Aramco, officially known as Saudi Arabian Oil Co., is speeding up preparations for an initial public offering. The company has selected banks for the share sale and may list as soon as November, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nEurasia also said:\n\n\u201cThe latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks\u201d\n\nCurrent valuation estimates of Aramco and its assets might not fully account for geopolitical risks NOTE: Crown Prince Mohammed, the architect of the IPO plan, has said he expects Aramco to be valued at over $2 trillion, but analysts see $1.5 trillion as more realistic Read More: Top Bankers Descend on Dubai Ritz as Aramco IPO Work Starts\n\n\n\nEurasia on oil prices:", "description": "Attacks May Impact Saudi Aramco IPO Valuation, Eurasia Says", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPECAK0NT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
