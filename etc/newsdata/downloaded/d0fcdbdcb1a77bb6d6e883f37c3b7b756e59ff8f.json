It can create an HD, 720p image that\u2019s up to 100 inches diagonally. But like all mini projectors, it doesn\u2019t get bright enough to work anywhere but in dark spaces.

I also could see most people balking at its cost: $579. Anker\u2019s predecessor to the Nebula Capsule II was our pick for the best mini projector last summer. This new one is so much better that it\u2019s a shame that it costs so much. It\u2019s a great little gadget.\n\nUnless you want to watch Netflix with it.\n\nOur review of Anker Nebula Capsule II Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Runs Android TV natively\n\nBattery lasts nearly three hours\n\nSpeaker is built in and gets plenty loud Bad Stuff No Netflix or Amazon Prime without weird hacks\n\nA little pricey for what it does\n\nNo easy way to save video on device (and not enough storage do it anyway) Buy for $579.99 from Amazon\n\nI love mini projectors. (You can also refer to them as micro or pico projectors, so I\u2019m playing fast and loose with the terminology for this category.) The basic idea is that you have something radically smaller than a traditional bulb-based projector that you might mount to your ceiling. You could take a mini projector camping or use it in your backyard.\n\nThe Capsule II is portable enough to put anywhere, but it\u2019s quite a bit bigger than the old one was. (Imagine one of those giant Foster\u2019s beer cans, then make it just a little taller.) You can hold it in one hand, and you can throw it in most bags, but you\u2019ll feel the one and a half pounds it weighs.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t know exactly what you\u2019d want it for, it\u2019s fun to imagine where you might create a gigantic screen on a whim \u2014 even if it\u2019s just projecting a horse on your friend. But use any mini projector for even a little bit, and you\u2019ll find they are still stuck in a particular phase of technological development: the fiddle zone.\n\nSimpler than other mini projectors, but it has its faults, too\n\nThere\u2019s just so much to fiddle with on a mini projector! You have to find a spot to use it that\u2019s dark enough (not to mention a surface that\u2019s large and flat enough to project on). You have to ensure it\u2019s aligned and straight and focused. You have to figure out how to get the video you actually want to watch on it. You have to figure out how to get enough sound out of it so everybody can hear it.\n\nWith a regular projector, you do all of that fiddling ahead of time. You create a permanent setup somewhere in your home over a weekend (or three) so that using your projector is as simple as turning on a traditional TV. With a portable mini projector, you face those challenges pretty much every time you want to use it.\n\nThe whole premise of the Capsule II is that it reduces the number of things you have to fiddle with. It is almost entirely successful in that \u2014 with a few unforced errors that are annoying but don\u2019t ruin the experience.\n\nOn a practical level, the Capsule II solves two problems that few other portable projectors manage. First, it has a decently loud, decently good 8W speaker built in, which means you have one less thing to worry about when you set up to watch a movie. You can even use it in a Bluetooth Speaker mode, which has the added benefit of lasting way longer than the standard three-ish hours it can run in projector mode.\n\nThe second problem the Capsule II solves is just getting content into the projector so that it can project it. It has an HDMI-in port, but most of the time, you don\u2019t need it because it runs a clean, native version of Android TV. That means you can use standard smart TV apps downloaded directly from the Google Play Store. As long as you can get a Wi-Fi connection, you can stream video from any app that\u2019s installed on the device.\n\nIt will support Chromecast from several apps if you have the video saved locally on your phone. The device itself has very little local storage, and Android TV apps aren\u2019t designed for downloaded content anyway. You can also play video via other means, including sideloaded apps that aren\u2019t available in the Google Play Store for Android TV or directly from video files saved on a USB thumb drive. (If you know what I mean, and I think you do.)\n\nThere\u2019s an included remote control, so you can use this projector like you would any smart TV. In fact, it comes with the Google Assistant built in, so you can speak into the remote for searches. If you take nothing else away from this review, remember this: it\u2019s a portable projector that\u2019s nearly as easy to use as your smart TV, and that\u2019s wonderful.\n\nSideloading Netflix and Amazon is not easy, nor is it fun\n\nAll of this simplicity made the Capsule II\u2019s most serious limitation all the more frustrating: the only way to play Netflix on it is a ridiculously hacky workaround. Netflix, you might recall, is very picky about what devices it will certify for its video, and the Capsule II hasn\u2019t made the cut yet. Netflix\u2019s certification block also applies to casting video, unfortunately. So to watch Netflix, you either have to be clever enough to sideload it yourself or you have to do it Anker\u2019s way.\n\nAnker\u2019s way is to install the smartphone app controller app, then send you through a series of convoluted steps to sideload Netflix on the device directly. If you were hoping to just use Cast for Netflix, sorry, that doesn\u2019t work either \u2014 nor does Airplay from Apple devices. From now on, you can only run Netflix by hitting the button in the smartphone app. It all works, technically, but it\u2019s an awful experience. It\u2019s pretty rough to ask users to install a literal file browser app, and it\u2019s just as rough to have to use a button on the phone to launch Netflix.\n\nSpeaking of rough: Amazon Prime Video is not compatible with this device, either. Aside from those limitations, I was able to watch all sorts of movies, HBO shows, and YouTube videos on it. Hulu, Spotify, Pandora. Sling, Showtime, CBS All Access, and a bunch of other standard smart TV apps are also available.\n\nBeyond finding the content you want to watch, there is still the challenge of getting a clean, rectangular, focused image. When you set down the Capsule II, it is able to use lasers to autofocus. So far, so good. Unfortunately, the likelihood that you\u2019d get the picture exactly where you want it on the first try is going to be low, so you\u2019ll move the capsule a little to fix it. Once you do, it\u2019ll go out of focus.\n\nAnker set up the software to trigger autofocus when the device is moved, but it doesn\u2019t work very well. One way to fix the autofocus \u2014 and this is what Anker suggested \u2014 is to pick the thing up and shake it. Fortunately, you can also hold down the HDMI button on the remote. A recent firmware update also made it possible to fix the autofocus by holding down the main center button on the top of the device itself.\n\nThe last fiddly thing you need to do in order to get a good picture is the \u201ckeystone\u201d adjustment, the thing that makes your picture look like a proper rectangle instead of a trapezoid. The Capsule II can only do vertical keystone adjustment, not horizontal. That means that you will need to position your projector centered directly in front of the surface you want to project on.\n\nGetting both vertical and horizontal keystone adjustments in something this small would be difficult, and Anker also tells me that to \u201ccomply with the Android TV certification regulations, we had to use only a vertical keystone.\u201d It\u2019s not a big deal, but you should be aware of it. There is a standard tripod mount on the bottom of the projector, so I just use it with a standard Joby GorillaPod tripod to make it easier to place in the right spot.\n\nThis all sounds dire, but in practice, it\u2019s not \u2014 at least not if you have the remote and something good to set the Capsule II down on. You center it on a wall, point it up, hit the button to autofocus, and you\u2019re done. Then it\u2019s time to start playing a movie, and so long as you\u2019ve got some kind of Wi-Fi, that\u2019s as easy as doing it on your TV (minus Netflix and Amazon Prime video). Pro tip: make sure that Google Play movies is hooked up to your Movies Anywhere account so you can access movies that were purchased on Amazon or iTunes.\n\nOnce a video is going, the experience is nice. The picture can get really big and doesn\u2019t seem to drift out of focus over time. The battery life really can reach just short of three hours in my experience, though you might want to have a charger or backup battery (it charges via USB-C) handy just in case. There is a fan that you can definitely hear inside, but it\u2019s not loud enough to distract from the actual sound of the video you\u2019re watching.\n\nAs for picture quality, don\u2019t expect this to be as good as your TV. You\u2019ll need a dark area, and the larger you make the screen, the darker your room should be. Anker rates it at 200 ANSI lumens, which is to say it\u2019s brighter than many other tiny projectors, but nowhere near as bright as a dedicated projector you plug in. I projected it on lots of different surfaces and as long as the surface was flat, it produced a clean and sharp 720p image.\n\nA portable projector is definitely an \u201caspirational\u201d gadget. You can easily imagine all sorts of situations where you would be the hero with a TV in your bag. I personally like having it because I don\u2019t want a TV in my bedroom. But sometimes, you know, you just need to be in bed all day and binge something, or maybe you have a backyard and want to have a little s\u2019mores-and-movie time.\n\nAsk yourself: how often will you really watch a movie after hanging out by the campfire?\n\nAll that sounds great! But it also sounds like the sort of thing you\u2019d daydream about but probably won\u2019t do as much as you\u2019d imagine. If this were a cheaper gadget, I\u2019d say go on and buy your dream \u2014 you only live once \u2014 but $579 is way too much to spend on a daydream.\n\nIf the price doesn\u2019t put you off and you\u2019re also the sort of person who isn\u2019t worried about those video content workarounds (I don\u2019t judge), I think it\u2019s a pretty great little TV in a can. I\u2019m glad I have one. But as I\u2019ve said before: if you have to pile on a bunch of caveats and if-thens before you recommend a product, that\u2019s not exactly a ringing endorsement.\n\nCorrection, 12:45PM ET, July 6th : After publication of this review, a reader emailed to let me know that you can fix the autofocus by holding down the center button on the capsule itself, likely the result of a firmware update. I regret the error and have updated the relevant paragraph above. I\u2019ve also added a small note that it doesn\u2019t support AirPlay.
