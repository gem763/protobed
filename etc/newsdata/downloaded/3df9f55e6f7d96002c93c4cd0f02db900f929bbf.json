Maybe another three maximum. That's it.'\n\nFury will take on Braun Strowman at a WWE Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia on Thursday before he turns his attention back to a rematch with Deontay Wilder on February 22 in Las Vegas.\n\nTyson Fury has met his match and is set to take on 6ft 8in Braun Strowman in a WWE clash\n\nBoxing fans are looking forward to the much-anticipated Fury vs Deontay Wilder rematch\n\nAfter that, the lineal heavyweight champion of the world could turn his back on the sport and continue a professional wrestling career.\n\nTyson Fury said: 'This is definitely a lifelong dream and something I have been looking forward to for a long, long time. I'm feeling ready, psyched and quietly confident.\n\n'I could stay in WWE. Who knows? It depends how much I like it on the night. We will make a decision afterwards.'\n\nWhile Fury's popularity in the United States is already impressive, success over Strowman would only increase his standing there.\n\nNot that it matters to the 'Gypsy King', who could not resist a dig at Wilder and questioned the personality of the 'Bronze Bomber'.\n\n'I have already got more American fans than Deontay Wilder. For whatever reasons Deontay Wilder is not popular in America and people don't like him,' Fury said.\n\n'He screams 'bomb squad' a lot and pretends to have a personality, but really he doesn't and there is no depth to him. He has got no substance, he is a loud mouth and screams 'bomb squad' and that is it.\n\n'Behind that there is no intellect, he comes out with random things that don't make sense. I am a trash talker, but sometimes I struggle to put together what he is talking about.'\n\nFury has been building his American profile after signing a reported \u00a380million deal with ESPN\n\nThe lineal heavyweight champion has attracted attention recently for his WWE appearances\n\nAn injury to Fury on Thursday could jeopardise his rematch with Wilder next year, but the American will also be in action before then with a bout against Luis Ortiz.\n\nFury - who beat Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015 to win the WBA, IBF, WBO, IBO and Ring Magazine titles - added: 'This keeps me active, keeps me in the gym and gives me something to focus on.\n\n'But it is not just about me. There are two men in a fight. Wilder has to get through his fight first injury free and even win.\n\n'I think he should come through, but Luis Ortiz is a dangerous customer and is not to be overlooked or underestimated.\n\n'For four or five rounds he is one of the most dangerous fighters in the world and he is a 6ft 4 southpaw who can punch hard.'\n\nFury famously picked himself off the canvas in the 12th round against Wilder in their first bout\n\nThe winner of Wilder versus Fury part two could go head-to-head with the victor in the Anthony Joshua and Andy Ruiz rematch.\n\nLondoner Joshua has received some criticism with his December 7 fight taking place in Saudi Arabia due to the country's human rights record.\n\nFury will also be fighting there, but this will be WWE's fourth pay-per-view event in the country with relationships strong between the professional wrestling organisation and Saudi Arabia.\n\n'I didn't consider it because I'm fighting for an organisation who sorts all that out,' Fury said when quizzed on the venue.\n\n'WWE have had all that stuff before and go through it on a daily basis. I am just a fighter and that's it.\n\n'I am not a politician or anything else, but in order for a country to change you have to be a part of the revolution and it is changing. Hence why so many big sporting contests are over there where as years ago none were over there so it is evolving.'\n\nWilder struggled to make inroads into Fury's defence with the rematch set to be a cracker\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of fellow boxers Floyd Mayweather and Mike Tyson by dipping his toe into WWE, Fury is confident he will have too much for Strowman, who is nicknamed 'The Monster Among Men'.\n\nFury, who has also hinted at a possible MMA career, said: 'The Gypsy King is going to win because I don't know how to lose. Happy Halloween! When I have knocked him out I will say that over the top of him.'", "description": "Tyson Fury faces Braun Strowman at a WWE  event in Saudi Arabia on Thursday but would not be drawn into confirming whether his wrestling debut was a one-off, or something more long-term.", "authors": ["George Sessions"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/09/20272524-0-image-a-43_1572256701256.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
