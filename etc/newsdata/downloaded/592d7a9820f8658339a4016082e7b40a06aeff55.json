Photo: Salwan Georges/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nAlva Johnson, a former Donald Trump campaign staffer, is dropping a lawsuit accusing the president of forcibly kissing her at an August 2016 rally. Citing a hostile judge, threats to her safety, and Trump\u2019s seemingly unlimited resources, Johnson said in a statement Thursday, \u201cI\u2019ve decided for the sake of my family that I will not continue with the case at this time.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old, who maintains her claim, filed suit against Trump in February accusing him of a pattern of \u201cracial and gender discrimination.\u201d She also cited Trump\u2019s behavior at a rally she put together for him in Tampa. In the complaint, Johnson said Trump tried to kiss her in an RV before the rally. She claims to have turned away at the last second, causing Trump to kiss her cheek and the corner of her mouth.\n\nWhen she filed suit in February, Johnson said she\u2019d been considering coming forward for more than two years. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to let it go,\u201d she told the Washington Post. \u201cYou want to move on with your life. I don\u2019t sleep. I wake up at 4 in the morning looking at the news. I feel guilty. The only thing I did was show up for work one day.\u201d\n\nAt the time, then\u2013White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called Johnson\u2019s allegation \u201cabsurd on its face.\u201d\n\nIn July, Trump attorney Charles Harder posted video of the kiss online and claimed that it vindicated Trump, writing in court documents that it proved Johnson\u2019s claims to be \u201centirely false.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn watching the Video, the only conclusion a reasonable person could reach is that the exchange was an innocent moment between a dedicated campaign staffer and the candidate for whom she was working.\u201d\n\nBut a lawyer for Johnson said the video showed just the opposite. \u201cWe are gratified and pleased that we finally have proof what Ms. Johnson has been alleging in this lawsuit,\u201d Hassan Zavareei told Politico. \u201cIt is basically exactly what Ms. Johnson has been saying.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Beast this week, Johnson said that the gravity of the interaction didn\u2019t fully resonate until October of 2016 when she heard Trump\u2019s now-infamous Access Hollywood tape.\n\n\u201cOnce the Access Hollywood tape came out, I knew that it wasn\u2019t just something that he did 15 years ago, that it was still his behavior, that he thinks he can violate your personal space, that he can kiss women without permission,\u201d Johnson recalled on Wednesday.\n\nAfter she filed the lawsuit, Johnson said she had to make \u201ca big adjustment\u201d to the onslaught of \u201cnasty comments and having your entire life under a microscope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people forget that I was at work. It\u2019s absurd to think that it was mutual,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. You should keep your hands to yourself, you should keep your lips to yourself.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, Trump has said he doesn\u2019t remember meeting Johnson. \u201cI do not know plaintiff Alva Johnson or recall having any interactions with her,\u201d he said.\n\nSign Up for the Intelligencer Newsletter Daily news about the politics, business, and technology shaping our world.
