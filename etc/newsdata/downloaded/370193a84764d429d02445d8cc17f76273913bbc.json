Kastrenakes had initially also sentenced him to 12 months of probation and ordered him to perform 150 hours of community service. On Friday, the judge reduced those terms to three months of probation and 30 hours of community service.\n\nThree days later, Kastrenakes vacated the probation sentence entirely, although he maintained that Somerville had been careless to not show up for jury duty on Aug. 21.\n\nSomerville said he overslept and didn\u2019t call the bailiff before heading straight to his afternoon job in an afterschool program at the West Palm Beach city parks department. His absence delayed the court by 45 minutes, according to court records.\n\nDeandre Somerville, 21, of West Palm Beach poses for a portrait on Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019, in West Palm Beach, Fla.
