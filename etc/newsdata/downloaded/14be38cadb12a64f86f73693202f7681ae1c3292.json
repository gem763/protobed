Avital, rises high on the Biblical Golan Heights. Surveillance antennas are conspicuous atop a heavily fortified installation. It\u2019s Israel\u2019s forward observation post peering into Syria; it\u2019s also now the place from which Israel monitors Iran and its allies on the other side of the border. Roughly a kilometre away, on the Syrian side, is Sleeping Elephant Hill, nicknamed for its shape. In 2012, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard and its Hezbollah allies set up a signals-intelligence post on the hill to monitor Israel. In 2015, they attempted to set up a more robust military presence nearby. An Israeli air strike took out their reconnaissance team, including the Revolutionary Guard general Mohammad Ali Allah-Dadi and Jihad Mughniyah, the Iranian-trained son of Imad Mughniyah, the assassinated first military commander of Hezbollah.\n\nAs it usually does, Iran temporarily stepped back, regrouped, and modified its tactics. In 2016, the Revolutionary Guard started shipping kits to convert short-range rockets into longer-range missiles, with precision guidance systems capable of hitting strategic targets in Israel, from an electricity grid to an airport or a desalination plant. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s called a game-changer,\u201d Uzi Rubin, the former head of Israel\u2019s Missile Defense Organization, told me. \u201cThey converted a weapon of terror into a military weapon for war. They\u2019d only need two hundred to stop Israel\u2019s ability to wage its own war.\u201d\n\nBy early 2018, the Revolutionary Guard had deployed at some forty military facilities in Syria, with their own headquarters, drone-control rooms, and training centers. At least a third of them were deployed to target Israel, not just to prop up the Syrian regime in its civil war, Israeli defense officials told me. Since early 2017, Israel has launched more than two hundred strikes against Iranian targets in Syria\u2014the most recent in August\u2014to contain the buildup.\n\nOn a sunny day last year, I looked across a peaceful plateau that surrounds Spy Mountain and Sleeping Elephant Hill. The area is green with farmland, apple and pear orchards, and vineyards for Golan wine. Most of the time, it\u2019s deceptively quiet. The Iranians are not visible. They now come and go dressed in Syrian military uniforms, a decoy tactic since Russia brokered a deal, a year ago, to keep Iran\u2019s personnel and weaponry eighty-five kilometres from the border, Israeli officials told me. They\u2019ve also hired residents in the Golan to work for them, as part of a widening network of armed allies in Syria, not all of whom are Syrian. And their weapons transfers keep coming.\n\nTehran and Jerusalem may be a thousand miles apart, but Iran\u2019s so-called axis of resistance\u2014which, by some counts, totals more than a hundred Shiite militias, with widely diverse manpower and mat\u00e9riel\u2014has become entrenched across the Middle East, right up to Israel\u2019s borders with Syria and Lebanon. Iran\u2019s network spans half a dozen countries and has so fundamentally altered the region\u2019s strategic balance that no nation can take on Iran and its proxies without risking multiple military challenges, major loss of life, devastating damage to infrastructure, or instability rippling through other nations. That applies even to the United States, nuclear-armed Israel, or Saudi Arabia, which spent fifty-five billion dollars\u2014or roughly five times\u2014more on defense in 2017 than Iran did.\n\nIran is unlikely to win a conflict. But it could insure that others don\u2019t win, either, at least not in the classic sense of a decisive victory. If Israel tried to destroy Iran\u2019s ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, \u201cwe would be able to destroy Beirut, but they would be able to destroy parts of Tel Aviv,\u201d Eran Etzion, the former head of policy planning at the Israeli Foreign Ministry, told me.\n\nThe same general principle applies to other countries contemplating military action against Iran after the September 14th attack on two Saudi sites that process more than half of the kingdom\u2019s oil production. The Trump Administration blamed Tehran. On Wednesday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Defense displayed parts of the weapons used in the attacks by eighteen unmanned drones and seven cruise missiles. Iran \u201csponsored\u201d them, it claimed.\n\nEn route to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the attack was \u201can act of war.\u201d In an interview with CNN on Thursday, the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, shot back with a warning of \u201call-out war\u201d with \u201ca lot of casualties\u201d if the United States or Saudi Arabia strikes Iran. \u201cI am making a very serious statement that we don\u2019t want to engage in a military confrontation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we won\u2019t blink to defend our territory.\u201d\n\nIran could respond to any strike on its territory by unleashing its allies elsewhere in the Middle East, as it did in the nineteen-eighties, when it aided proxies that bombed two U.S. embassies and the barracks of U.S. Marine peacekeepers in Lebanon. The attacks ended up forcing the Reagan Administration to withdraw its peacekeepers.\n\nIran\u2019s oldest, most sophisticated, and best-armed proxy is Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. Iraq has the largest collection of Iranian-backed militias\u2014more than sixty. Some are decades old; others are new. Syria hosts a growing array of Iran-orchestrated warlords, gangs, and armed groups created during the chaos of its civil war. Iran also arms and trains Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels, who claimed the September 14th attack on Saudi oil installations, and Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Among the more recent Iranian-mobilized militias are the Fatemiyoun, from Afghanistan, and the Zainabiyoun, from Pakistan. \u201cIran wants hegemony in the region not by re-creating the Persian Empire that occupied all lands to Egypt but, this time, by building up a satellite force across the region,\u201d Rubin told me. Last year, the U.S. National Defense Strategy, the first in a decade, concluded, \u201cIn the Middle East, Iran is competing with its neighbors, asserting an arc of influence and instability while vying for regional hegemony, using state-sponsored terrorist activities, a growing network of proxies, and its missile program to achieve its objectives.\u201d\n\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, aimed at squeezing Iran economically, and Israel\u2019s air strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq have had limited impact, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Affairs. \u201cThere has been an increase in the overall size and capability of foreign forces that are partnered with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps,\u201d Seth Jones, a former adviser to the commanding general of U.S. Special Operations Forces, wrote. \u201cIran\u2019s economic woes have not contributed to declining activism in the region.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s shifted in recent years is Iran\u2019s ability to consolidate allies and proxies into a web or grid that can operate regionally. The Islamic Republic facilitates the movement of militias to bolster other allies. The Quds Force pulled Shiite militias from Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to fight in Syria. In 2014, it manipulated the transfer of militias from the Shiite-dominated region of southern Iraq to Sunni regions in the north, to fight ISIS. It has fostered offshoots of Hezbollah in Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf, albeit with mixed effectiveness. \u201cWhat matters is that Iran can now connect the dots\u2014from Lebanon to Syria to Iraq,\u201d an Israeli defense official told me.\n\nIran\u2019s allies in the axis of resistance have, in turn, entered politics, transforming armed movements into powerful players in governments that decide policy. They\u2019re altering the political status quo across the Middle East, too. Hezbollah emerged from the underground in 1992 to run for parliament in Lebanon, the most Westernized Arab country. Today, it has seats in parliament and also cabinet posts, and the Christian President is its hand-picked ally. By 2003, Iran had deepened its presence in Iraq through a network of Shiite militias commanded by Iranian-trained operatives. By 2014, a proliferating array of militias\u2014with tens of thousands of fighters\u2014merged into the Popular Mobilization Forces (P.M.F.) to fight ISIS after the Iraqi Army collapsed. The Baghdad government put them on its payroll. In 2016, Parliament made the P.M.F. an independent arm of Iraq\u2019s security forces. In 2018, militia leaders and politicos ran for parliament. They now constitute one of the strongest blocs and had a major role in selecting Iraq\u2019s latest Prime Minister.\n\nIn Yemen, the Houthis are a political movement\u2014called Ansar Allah, or \u201cSupporters of God\u201d\u2014and also a militia. In 2015, they seized control of Sana\u2019a, the Yemeni capital, and ousted the government. The Houthis now rule much of northern Yemen. Iran\u2019s role in arming and training the Houthis has deepened since Saudi Arabia launched an air war against the Shiite rebels, four years ago. Iranian missiles and drones have allegedly been used in targeting Saudi installations. Under Iranian tutelage, Hezbollah has created a branch in Yemen.\n\nIran has even out-gamed Israel\u2014despite Tehran\u2019s military limits, economic woes, and diplomatic challenges. \u201cIsrael is tactical. Iran is strategic. Israel is short-term, Iran is long-term,\u201d Etzion said. \u201cIran is the master of the indirect proxy war\u2014and Israel is not.\u201d\n\nFrom Iran\u2019s prism, it\u2019s a survival strategy\u2014defensive rather than offensive. \u201cIran feels strategically lonely,\u201d Nasser Hadian, a U.S.-educated political scientist at the University of Tehran, told me. Strengthening Shiite minorities across the region\u2014whether arming or politically empowering them\u2014is Iran\u2019s ultimate line of defense. The common denominator is Iran\u2019s Quds Force and its commander, General Qassem Soleimani, a former bodybuilder turned military commander, who has become Iran\u2019s strategic puppeteer. He has been photographed with Shiite militias across the Middle East. Iran may now be able to count on more than a hundred and eighty thousand armed men in proxy forces in six countries\u2014Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan\u2014Jones wrote, in the C.S.I.S. report. That\u2019s an increase of up to fifty thousand since 2011.\n\nIsraelis once called their tensions with Iran a \u201cshadow war,\u201d designed to contain Tehran and deter a full-fledged conflict. Since May, however, confrontations with Iran have been in full view: Ever more sophisticated attacks against Israel. Six foreign tankers sabotaged outside the Strait of Hormuz. A sophisticated American drone shot down off the Iranian coast. And now attacks on major Saudi oil installations. In each incident, Tehran has been implicated, directly or indirectly. It no longer has a credible route to plausible deniability. Having covered every conflict in the Middle East since the 1973 War, I\u2019ve been asking all week: How much longer will the Golan\u2014or any other place in the Middle East\u2014stay quiet amid these mounting tensions?", "description": "Robin Wright writes about the recent attack on Saudi oil-production sites and the powerful network of proxies that Iran has cultivated across the Middle East.", "authors": ["Robin Wright", "Colton Wooten", "Charles Duhigg", "Andy Borowitz", "Michael Schulman", "Rachel Syme"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d83f72af48e6d00080402c8/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/Wright-IranProxies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
