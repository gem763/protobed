Those sorts of figures make Elon Musk\u2019s company look like a staid and sensible investment.\n\nWhat\u2019s most striking is that NIO is racking up these massive losses in spite of a business model that in theory ought to be far more efficient than conventional carmaking. In that sense, the better comparison isn\u2019t Tesla, but WeWork \u2013 a company that pitched itself as a radically different technology play, only to be brought down to earth by the humdrum nature of operating in the real world.\n\nOne thing that makes NIO unusual is that, as my colleague Anjani Trivedi has explained, it doesn\u2019t actually make cars. Instead it takes 45,000 yuan deposits from customers, provides a drive-train, and contracts out the rest of the build process to Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp. On top of that, it doesn\u2019t have a dealership network, instead selling cars through an app and a web of slick WeWork-style clubs, known as NIO Houses.\n\nIn principle, that could result in efficient deployment of capital, but things start to look dicey when theory comes up against the reality of NIO\u2019s spending habits. If you compare revenue over the past year to NIO\u2019s tangible fixed assets, it has some of the worst capital efficiency in the global car industry. For a company that doesn\u2019t own assembly plants, that\u2019s a heroically bad performance.\n\nWhat\u2019s going wrong? For starters, contract manufacturing isn\u2019t as efficient as you might think. Even excluding the costs associated with recalling almost a fifth of the cars NIO has sold due to battery fires and overheating, the gross margin on vehicles was minus 4% in the second quarter.\n\nThe real problems show up below the gross profit level, though. Given retail prices of around 450,000 yuan for the flagship ES8, the numbers are astonishing. Per-car R&D came to an additional 366,000 yuan; sales, general & administrative costs were 400,000 yuan on top of that. Together with its cost of sales, NIO is shelling out around 1.27 million yuan each for a vehicle that sells for barely a third as much.\n\nIf anything, that situation is likely to get worse in the months ahead. NIO\u2019s answer to the Tesla Model 3 \u2013 a car aimed at a more mass-market audience, with a lower price that erodes what little margin its costlier predecessors could claim \u2013 went on sale in June in the form of the ES6, with prices starting at 360,000 yuan. Government subsidies that amounted to 67,500 yuan per car last year have been staged down to 11,520 yuan. The result is that an ES6 bought now is only marginally cheaper than a fancier ES8 purchased last year.\n\nHow can NIO turn this around? R&D should be treated as a down payment on future sales, so it\u2019s to be expected that it makes up an oversize share of costs at the startup stage. The same can\u2019t be said of SG&A, though. You could buy a very nice car for the roughly $57,000 of overhead on each vehicle sold in the second quarter. Based on 2018\u2019s annual results only about a fifth of that is going on marketing (another expense that might be abnormally high at the startup stage).\n\nEye-watering staff costs are a standout. NIO spent 4.11 billion yuan last year paying a workforce that reached 9,900 people in January. That averages out at compensation of 415,000 yuan per employee, more than three times the average white-collar salary in China\u2019s tier-one cities. Plans to cut headcount to a target of 7,800 next week look like moving around the deckchairs on the Titanic.\n\nNIO\u2019s unique selling point has always been that it could provide luxury electric vehicles in China at a price well below foreign SUV competitors. The problem is, the discount doesn\u2019t appear to come from operational efficiencies, but from losing money on every car.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Haven\u2019t we seen this play before?NIO\u00a0Inc., a Chinese electric-vehicle maker that was talked up as a potential Tesla Inc.-killer before its $1.15 billion\u00a0initial public offering last year, is falling apart before our eyes.The stock fell 20% in the U.S. on Tuesday after the company", "authors": ["David Fickling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XI4.XPbvKCFjlbXtk4cKbQ--~B/aD0xODEwO3c9MTI5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/0c0bf5ea89e7be12e88cdc09b7d9fd93", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
