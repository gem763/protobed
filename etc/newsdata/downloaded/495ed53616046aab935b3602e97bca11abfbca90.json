QE is a matter for the RBA\u2019s independent monetary policy process and should be kept way from politicians and fiscal policy.\n\nMore ammo left\n\nThere is considerable value in the RBA demonstrating that QE means it has ample monetary policy ammunition left. At the same time, it is appropriate for Frydenberg to maintain his laser-like focus on building fiscal space through budget surpluses. History has shown that it is much easier to get central banks to normalise interest rates than it is to convince profligate politicians to balance their books.\n\nFrydenberg\u2019s inaugural budget surplus last financial year (on the net operating balance and fiscal balance measures), which we had long forecast, was an important first step along the road to meeting the government\u2019s core electoral promise of repaying Australia\u2019s record public debt.\n\nSo why is the current QE thinking so muddle-headed? First, buying government bonds is unlikely to do much good in Australia. The RBA\u2019s former deputy governor, Stephen Grenville, explained why during the week, although he overlooked the alternative solutions. Because most Australian private debt is floating-rate, as opposed to fixed-rate, it prices off the short-term cash rate plus a credit spread, or risk premium, rather than long-term government bond yields. As a consequence, all Australian banks hedge their wholesale funding back to a spread above the cash rate or a proxy therein, such as the bank bill swap rate, which itself embeds a bank credit risk premium.\n\nThis means that the RBA buying long-term government bonds is not going to do much to influence domestic rates. It might put downward pressure on the Aussie dollar, which will be stimulatory. But even this outcome is uncertain because the exchange rate is determined by global forces over which the RBA has limited control. Indeed, restricting Aussie QE to government bonds exposes the RBA to non-trivial reputational risk if it is perceived to fail.\n\nAnother concern with buying government bonds is that doing so could further reduce bank profitability in a climate where they already face a multiplicity of return on equity headwinds. APRA and the RBA require banks to hold up to one-third of all government bonds as part of their emergency liquidity books. If the RBA crushes the interest rates on these assets, it will crimp bank profits and reduce the probability that they improve product rates.\n\nThe one area where QE is likely to have a profound impact on savings and borrowing rates is if it compresses the risk premium above the cash rate that banks fund themselves at. As I have explained before, credit spreads on the banks\u2019 senior bonds are some eight to 10 times wider than in 2007 and elevated by global standards, even though risk-weighted leverage has halved. It is well-known that Aussie banks have to pay materially more to raise money in global markets than similarly-rated peers. Our internal analysis shows that this is driven by the skinny pool of capital domestic super funds make available for investments in local fixed income given their huge equity biases (the latter is an artefact of super funds being judged based on their raw, not risk-adjusted, returns, which motivates them to chase the riskiest possible equity, not debt, investments).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news is that there are many ways the RBA can crush this intermediated cost of capital while also ensuring banks pass on the savings to customers. The first would involve lengthening out the term of the RBA\u2019s current overnight lending operations via its repurchase (or \u201crepo\u201d) arrangements to much longer tenors of say one, two or three years. The Bank of England did something similar in 2016. The RBA could further require any banking tapping this liquidity to agree to pass on the savings to depositors and borrowers. This would contract funding risk premia while also reducing the quantum of wholesale bond issuance, which would reinforce the positive effects on a second-order basis.\n\nAnother option\n\nA complementary solution would be for the RBA to commit some of its QE program to a similar form of lending via direct asset purchases of any securities that the RBA accepts as collateral under its repo operations. These include government bonds, senior bank bonds, and AAA-rated asset-backed securities.\n\nThe Fed, ECB and Bank of England customised their QE initiatives to their local peculiarities and the RBA should do likewise. We don\u2019t really have a corporate bond market, so buying what little corporate paper is issued makes no sense. In contrast to the US and Europe, our banks are much more heavily reliant on wholesale funding, rather than deposits, to underwrite the loans they extend to businesses and households. Accordingly, targeting intermediated funding costs is crucial to ensuring the RBA\u2019s monetary policy transmission mechanism works properly.\n\nIt is not widely appreciated that we have previously profited from both these forms of QE. During the 2008 crisis, the RBA extended its repo terms to 12 months at ultra-low-cost, expanding its balance sheet by 50 per cent. Those operations were about maintaining liquidity. This time around, QE would focus on enhancing the RBA\u2019s transmission mechanism.\n\nIn 2008 professor Joshua Gans and I convinced the government to have treasury buy over $10 billion of AAA-rated residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), in the first form of asset purchase-based QE Australia had ever seen. It is ironic that the bureaucrats who strongly advised the government not to pursue this policy now crow about its success. The RMBS market has since boomed and is an increasingly significant source of secured funding for lenders.\n\nLast year I developed a similar plan for the government to invest $2 billion into small business loans, which is another form of QE to ameliorate the cost of SME borrowing. I have no doubt that this will eventually revolutionise the ability of SMEs to access cheap global capital in the same way the Treasury\u2019s RMBS investments have done.\n\nThere is an argument that QE could become politically problematic if it is seen to help banks. But who on main street knows about the government buying $15 billion of RMBS? Few, if any. It would be easy for the RBA to keep its QE explanations in the technical domain that will have a half-life of seconds in the public consciousness. To the extent it does improve product rates, it should only be popular among those who do fathom the linkages.\n\nNote: the RBA\u2019s new paper on QE contains a non-trivial error that it should address. When the RBA drafted the terms of its Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF), it confused the concepts of bank solvency, liquidity and positive net worth. In particular, it stated that to access the CLF, a bank would have to be \u201csolvent\u201d. Economists like to pretend that solvency means \u201cpositive net worth\u201d. But under both the Banking Act and the Corporations Act, solvency is a liquidity test about the ability to repay debts as and when they fall due, not a net worth test (Allco had positive net worth, but was insolvent). And, by definition, any bank needing to use the CLF is insolvent without it. Once I pointed this out, the RBA\u2019s Deputy Governor, Guy Debelle, changed the CLF documents to remove the reference to \u201csolvency\u201d and replace it with a positive \u201cnet worth\u201d criterion. In this latest paper, the RBA\u2019s Nicholas Garvin makes the same mistake when he says his \u201cmodel depicts a banking system that is solvent, but a system-wide withdrawal by debtholders leaves banks with short-term payment obligations that exceed their available funds (ie, their liquidity)\u201d. This is both practically and legally wrong. Technically, the model depicts a banking system that is insolvent due to a liquidity crisis, but one that has positive net worth.\n\nThe author is a portfolio manager with Coolabah Capital Investments, which invests in fixed-income securities including those discussed by this column.
