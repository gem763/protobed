Superheroes who used to come to the rescue in comic books now do it digitally. In this era of global consciousness, regular folks can roll up their sleeves and join the ranks of the adored. Now it\u2019s called saving the planet, and it doesn\u2019t require a cape and tights. The only prerequisite is a willingness to turn thumbs up for environmental activism, and the United Nations is all thumbs with its Climate Action Summit, a warm-up act for the U.N. General Assembly opening on Tuesday in New York.\n\nBuilding on the vision of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called on global leaders to help the international body provide \u201cconcrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nU.N. climate change advocates want to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions to levels that limit the rise in global temperatures to less 2 degrees Celsius over the next 12 years, and even roll them back to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.\n\nThese are ambitious \u201cgreen\u201d goals, touted as necessary to stave off the existential threat to all living things except, ironically, all green things. Plants thrive on the carbon dioxide that makes up the majority of supposed dangerous emissions. If trees could walk and talk, they would likely picket the proceedings at the U.N. monolith on Turtle Bay.\n\nThe secretary-general has prioritized \u201caction portfolios\u201d that could contribute toward greenhouse gas reduction, not the least of which would be \u201cmobilizing public and private sources of finance to drive decarbonization of all priority sectors and advance resilience.\u201d Trying to convince nations to hit up taxpayers and lean on businesses in order to condition the air requires super-heroics. Democrats\u2019 Green New Deal, which outlines a wholesale makeover of the U.S. economy, carries a price tag that could reach $93 trillion over a decade. It\u2019s unsurprising that in a CBS poll conducted last week, only 15 percent of respondents \u201cdescribe the Green New Deal as a good plan that encompasses what\u2019s needed to address climate change.\u201d\n\nOther action items include \u201caccelerating the shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, as well as making significant gains in energy efficiency.\u201d The Islamic Republic of Iran, a U.N. member in good standing, might have unique insights to share in this regard. The Gulf nation has, in all likelihood, made the U.N.\u2019s case against the viability of fossil fuel in recent months by attaching mines to nearby oil tankers and in the past week, taking out half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities with drones and cruise missiles.\n\nAn immediate 10-cent average pump price hike, which the American Automobile Association says could rise to 25 cents by the end of the month, demonstrates that there is method to the mullahs\u2019 madness.\n\nRenewable energy, sadly, is not yet ready for prime time. All \u201cgreen\u201d sources combined currently provides Americans with 11 percent of their energy needs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, the proportion is 13.5 percent, says the International Energy Agency. Nearly 1 billion souls across the planet are still waiting in the dark for electricity from any possible source \u2014 renewable or fossil. The prospect of cranking back the spigot on the global oil supply without a reliable replacement would hardly be greeted with gusto to match that of the U.N. summiteers.\n\nThose who would save the world require a doomsday scenario to combat, and there have been plenty of false alarms in the past. Among them is the 1970 prediction by NASA and Columbia University that the world was as little as 50 to 60 years away from a new ice age.\n\nStill, forecasts of catastrophic global warming are not something to be taken lightly. The third orb from the sun is the only habitat that humanity can presently call home, given that the fourth one next-door looks to be a fixer-upper. Careful study of the Earth\u2019s evolving climate must trump trendy political opportunists who insist on calling the science \u201csettled\u201d and ignoring evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe current crop of climate-change superheroes wielding their pointy thermometers at the U.N. should beware their ministrations are not featured in the comics of future generations.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
