North Korea denied mistreating him, saying he fell into a coma that resulted from botulism and a sleeping pill.\n\nFred and Cindy Warmbier, from Cincinnati, say their son was tortured in prison and they were angered by Trump\u2019s comments this spring that he took North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \u201cat his word\u201d that he was unaware of any mistreatment.\n\nTrump later tweeted: \u201cOf course I hold North Korea responsible for Otto\u2019s mistreatment and death.\u201d The tweet made no mention of Kim, with whom Trump is pursuing nuclear talks.\n\nA law firm representing the Warmbier family did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump\u2019s ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, was expected to join the dinner. Officials say he is among the 15 candidates Trump is considering to replace ousted national security adviser John Bolton.", "description": "Richard Grenell, contender to be new national security adviser, to attend dinner with Otto and Cindy Warmbier, who have been angered by Trump tweets", "authors": ["Associated Press In Washington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd385c53a3a8800483218c2a1626fe20ae981bd/0_131_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a213a841954b6b7d2d4c9c8ea54d4521", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
