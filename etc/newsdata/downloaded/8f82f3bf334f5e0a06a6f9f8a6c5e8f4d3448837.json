But it\u2019s also important to protect the right of MPs to speak freely in the House of Commons about important political matters and the fact of the so-called Benn Act is that it surrenders our powers.\u201d\n\nTensions remained high in parliament after Wednesday night\u2019s toxic and heated scenes in the House of Commons. A Labour MP, Karl Turner, confronted Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, over death threats received by MPs overnight following the parliamentary debate. Cummings responded: \u201cGet Brexit done.\u201d\n\nAt an event later, Cummings later doubled down on his suggestion that only carrying out Brexit would calm tensions.\n\n\u201cI know people on both sides of leave and remain who have had serious threats like that, and it is obviously bad. In the end the situation can only be resolved by parliament honouring its promise to respect the result.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he blamed MPs for the abuse they were getting, Cummings said: \u201cThe MPs said we will have a referendum, we will respect the result and then they spent three years swerving all over the shop.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising some people are angry about it. I find it very odd that these characters are complaining that people are unhappy about their behaviour now and they also say they want a referendum. How does that compute for them?\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s hardline language and tactics appeared to show he is increasingly focused on fighting an election, amid pessimism in the government and Brussels about the chances of reaching a new EU withdrawal agreement at the October summit. He told his cabinet that the phrase \u201csurrender bill\u201d was hitting home with voters and would form a key part of any campaign.\n\nWith Labour refusing an election until no deal is off the table, Johnson is still insisting that he will not have to seek an extension from the EU if he fails to reach a deal.\n\nMany opposition MPs are sceptical that there really is a way to circumvent the Benn law, but Sir John Major, the former prime minister, will warn on Friday that the government could seek a \u201corder of council\u201d to delay that legislation coming into effect.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that the government will seek to bypass statute law, by passing an order of council to suspend the Act until after 31 October,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that an order of council can be passed by privy councillors \u2013 that is government ministers \u2013 without involving the Queen.\n\n\u201cI should warn the prime minister that \u2013 if this route is taken \u2013 it will be in flagrant defiance of parliament and utterly disrespectful to the supreme court.\n\n\u201cIt would be a piece of political chicanery that no-one should ever forgive or forget.\u201d\n\nNo 10 declined to comment on the idea but there were signs that Johnson\u2019s administration has not resiled from its combative approach to the law, which led to the supreme court ruling unanimously that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.\n\nA cabinet source said Johnson is preparing to prorogue parliament again a few days before a Queen\u2019s speech to set out his domestic agenda, with the current intention to stick to the original date of 14 October. The prime minister also intends to carry on with Conservative party conference next week as usual, while opposition MPs sit in parliament attempting to undermine his strategy.\n\nThroughout the day on Thursday, Johnson took a defiant approach to the criticism of MPs who lambasted him for his language in the House of Commons, refusing to appear for a question in parliament on his rhetoric. Instead, he addressed Tory backbench MPs, telling them that he would carry on referring to the \u201csurrender bill\u201d.\n\nTory MPs said the mood of Johnson\u2019s meeting had been \u201clargely supportive\u201d but others sighed or raised their eyebrows when asked how he had performed.\n\nNicky Morgan, the culture secretary, sent a pointed tweet saying that a \u201ctime of strong feelings we all need to remind ourselves of the effect of everything we say on those watching us\u201d, although she cushioned it with a claim that the prime minister was sympathetic about threats received by MPs.\n\nHowever, Johnson was criticised more directly by his own sister, Rachel, who told Sky News: \u201cI think it was a very tasteless way of referring to the memory of a murdered MP, murdered by someone who said \u2018Britain first\u2019, of the far-right tendency, which you could argue is being whipped up by this sort of language.\n\nPlay Video 1:11 Boris Johnson's sister says his Jo Cox remarks were 'tasteless' \u2013 video\n\n\u201cMy brother is using words like surrender and capitulation as if the people standing in the way of the blessed will of the people as defined by 17.4m votes in 2016 should be hung, drawn, quartered, tarred and feathered. I think that is highly reprehensible language to use.\u201d\n\nJohnson was also taken to task directly by Jess Phillips, the Labour MP, in the voting lobbies over his hostile rhetoric, on the same day a man was arrested outside her office.\n\nThe prime minister later acknowledged that there was a \u201creasonable anxiety\u201d that MPs in other parties may be less willing to vote for any Brexit deal because of the divisive nature of Wednesday\u2019s debate. However, some Labour backbenchers are still willing to consider what is on offer if there is a chance of resolving Brexit.\n\nStephen Kinnock, who is a member of the MPs for a Deal group, said: \u201cJohnson\u2019s language, tone and behaviour are not helpful but we must not allow ourselves to be distracted from the number one priority which is to secure a deal that protects \u2026 our constituents so that we can then begin to reunite our deeply divided country.\u201d\n\nWhen asked at Thursday night\u2019s event in London whether Johnson was under pressure to deliver Brexit, Cummings said: \u201cWe are not under pressure, the referendum was pressure. The referendum was difficult. This is a walk in the park compared to the referendum. We are enjoying this, we are going to leave and we are going to win.\u201d", "description": "PM\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings claims that only carrying out Brexit will calm tensions", "authors": ["Rowena Mason"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f463198c7f686c6456f46506d4dcaafa74876819/35_64_3464_2078/master/3464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0c57a7223c4d93dd5831cfd760875d5a", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
