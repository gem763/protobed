Its proportional representation system, see below, tends to help smaller, fringe parties.\n\nThe current coalition government consists of the centre-right People\u2019s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the centre-left Labour Party (PvdA).\n\nWilders\u2019 anti-Islam and anti-EU Party, PVV, who had been leading the polls, slipped to second in the rankings on March 1, two weeks ahead of the vote.\n\nThere is also the Christian Democrats (CDA), struggling in recent years compared to past performance; the pro-European D66, comparable to the UK\u2019s Liberal Democrats; the environmentalists GroenLinks (GL); and the Socialist Party (SP).\n\nOn the fringes are parties such as Denk, who campaign for migrants and their descendants and 50Plus, a party representing older people.\n\nHow does the Dutch election system work?\n\nIt is based on proportional representation. So a party that gets 9 percent of the national vote, gets 9 percent of seats in the Dutch parliament, Tweede Kamer. There are no electoral districts, the Dutch vote in a single, nationwide constituency.\n\nThe Dutch parliament has 150 seats, so 76 are needed for a majority and hence a viable coalition to run the government.\n\nCould Wilders really be the Netherlands\u2019 next prime minister?\n\nMany experts [here, here and here] even while acknowledging the shocks of Brexit and Trump, think not. The very system that allows parties like Wilders\u2019 to have a voice also provides a mechanism against parliament being dominated by one party.\n\n\u201cI think the headline reporting that suggests Wilders is about to takeover The Netherlands is misleading, that is definitely not the case,\u201d Gijs De Vries, a former Dutch politician, now working at the London School of Economics\u2019 European Institute. \u201cNumerically at least, as much as we can trust the polls, he\u2019s not getting above 20 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cSecondly he will have great difficulty joining a government coalition. The other parties have so far claimed they would not wish to join in a coalition that included Mr Wilders.\u201d\n\nPrime minister Mark Rutte, leader of the governing VDD party, says he cannot imagine his movement joining forces with Wilders in a coalition.\n\nBut, adds De Vries, Rutte has changed his mind on some key issues before, for example sending EU aid to Greece and respecting the outcome of the EU-Ukraine referendum.\n\n\u201cWilders is very unlikely to be in government, unless everyone else flat-lines in voting,\u201d Euroscepticism specialist Simon Usherwood, from the University of Surrey, told Euronews. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong sense of wanting to exclude him [Wilders], even if that means a big coalition and other compromises on policy. It also suits Wilders more to be on the outside, criticising.\u201d\n\nHow is Wilders influencing the campaign?\n\n\u201cWilders\u2019 discourse is increasingly being copied and rehashed by his competitors,\u201d De Vries told Euronews. \u201cMr Rutte [current PM] wrote an open letter in a major Dutch newspaper, which, between the lines said \u2018if foreigners don\u2019t behave the way, we, the original Dutch want, they had better pack their bags\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Christian Democrats leader, not to be outdone, has just said he would be happy to tear up the [EU\u2019s} treaty with Ukraine [which the Dutch rejected in a referendum], pandering to the anti-EU sentiment in part of the population.\n\n\u201cWilders\u2019 competitors compete with him by embracing some of his ideas without the extremism Wilders purports.\u201d\n\nWhat role is the issue of Muslims and immigration playing?\n\nThe debate around the role of Islam in Dutch society was electrified by two murders earlier this century, said De Vries\n\nOutspoken film-maker Theo van Gogh, who produced a film criticising Islam, was killed by a militant Islamist in 2004. That followed the murder of anti-immigrant populist Pim Fortuyn in May 2002 by an animal rights activist.\n\n\u201cAt local level most people get along with their neighbours,\u201d said De Vries. \u201cMuslims, Christians, non-believers or Buddhists.\n\n\u201cBut I think there are many genuine concerns from people who feel their neighbourhoods are no longer the environment they knew when they grew up as children.\n\n\u201cThat is a feeling many people have and it\u2019s genuine and it should be taken very seriously. At the same time it\u2019s also clear you have a number of politicians who actively fan the flames of xenophobia. And it\u2019s obvious Mr Wilders is one of them. If you go into the elections saying you will close all Islamic schools, even though you want Christians to be free to form their schools, you are clearly trying to exploit a divide. He\u2019s got support but many people find he\u2019s going much too far.\u201d\n\nDutch Muslims make up around 5 percent of the country\u2019s population. More than one-in-three respondents from The Netherlands said they had an unfavourable view of Muslims in a Pew Research Survey.\n\nRegarding the EU\u2019s refugee influx, The Netherlands received around 33,000 asylum requests in the year to September 2016, according to Eurostat.\n\nWhat are the other issues on voters\u2019 minds?\n\nThe economy is an issue, even though some of the country\u2019s indicators are positive. Unemployment, for instance, was 5.4 percent in December 2016. But, said De Vries, there are concerns, particularly among young people, that a lot of employment is insecure because of temporary positions and zero-hour contracts.\n\nHealth is also important for voters, he added, even though The Netherlands topping the Euro Health Consumer Index.\n\nDe Vries said the concern that people have is that they have to pay more to access the healthcare system and that is the classic ideological debate between the left, who want to increase investment, and right who says it\u2019s becoming too costly.", "description": "He wants to halt Muslim immigration, close all mosques and ban a Koran that he compares to Adolf Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf.", "authors": ["Chris Harris"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/359277/1000x563_359277.jpg", "published_at": "2017-03-13"}
