The alarm goes, he dons an indiscriminate tracksuit and steps out into Las Vegas\u2019 hardened sunrise. Waiting at the track is Romero Duno, a lightweight Filipino boxer, who fights Ryan Garcia next month \u2013 Mexico\u2019s 21-year-old prince-in-waiting \u2013 15 miles down the strip where dust turns to sequins at the foot of the MGM Grand.\n\nThe training is meticulous; web spun by stopwatches, regimens and an alphabet of supplements. For one of the sport\u2019s most successful strength and conditioning coaches, boxing is a science orbiting around invisible margins; not one atom can fall out of place.\n\nA brick-shouldered 6\u20193\u201d former discus champion, he shouts encouragement as Duno runs sprints and follows a programme of heavy weightlifting, and then recedes to the shadows to watch his sinewed experiment spar in one of the many boxing gyms stitched into the city\u2019s suburbs. \u201cI\u2019m the only guy that changes the odds,\u201d Heredia says. \u201cA fighter is the underdog, but when people find out he\u2019s working with me, the odds change.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n***\n\n10 March, 2005 \u2013 Heredia spent a decade manipulating the odds until, finally, they turned against him. For two years, he had evaded the FBI, living under a pseudonym at an outlying Texas A&M University campus in Kingsville. He reigned in plain sight as one of the principal architects of doping in athletics, visited by athletes, accosted by agents and coaches. Twelve of his clients won a combined 26 Olympic and 21 World Championship medals. \u201cDoping is a business,\u201d Heredia says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a track athlete running 9.9s, [in the 100m], you might spend anywhere between $20,000 and $50,000 [on PEDs] a year.\u201d\n\nBut as he returned from the gym on a suffocating Southern afternoon, two police officers stood by Heredia\u2019s door. As he entered his room, he found the lanky frame of Inland Revenue Service investigator Jeff Novitzky staring back at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with Trevor Graham?\u201d he asked.\n\nTwo years before Heredia was finally tracked down, Graham and Balco founder Victor Conte were principal rivals in US track and field. Both \u2013 correctly \u2013 suspected each other\u2019s athletes of using PEDs. One morning, Graham, who trained the likes of Marion Jones, Tim Montgomery and later Justin Gatlin, posted a syringe containing a designer drug he believed Conte\u2019s athletes were using to the United States Anti-Doping Association (USADA), asking them to investigate under the guise of being a whistleblower.\n\nWhen Novitzky led an IRS investigation into Balco, he found a crumpled letter written by Conte. It alleged that Graham\u2019s athletes were doping using the help of a Mexican distributor nicknamed \u2018Memo\u2019.\n\nHeredia\u2019s cover was blown. A week later, when Novitzky presented his lawyer with a subpoena and evidence linking him to the illegal distribution of PEDs; transcripts of conversations; copies of blood tests; wire transfer receipts and witness statements, he made a plea deal to testify against Graham and avoid a jail sentence, becoming the highest-profile federal witness in doping history.\n\n\u201cAll of these guys were friends of mine, we\u2019d known each other for years,\u201d he says. \u201cWe still see each other till this day. We say hello, there\u2019s no harm, we\u2019ve all moved on, we\u2019ve got families. Many years knowing each other, then going against each other, it\u2019s tough but I had to make a decision and I did the right thing.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAngel Guillermo Heredia \u2013 Memo to his friends \u2013 is the son of a chemical engineer, born into a family of doctors in a privileged Mexican neighbourhood in 1975. He excelled at sports before eventually taking up the discus, winning national titles at junior level and harbouring dreams of competing at the Summer Olympics. \u201cWhen I was young, I was always clean,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then I started noticing a lot of my friends and athletes [using PEDs]. When you\u2019re working and training hard every day, it burns on your mind.\u201d\n\nDespite experimenting with PEDs, he didn\u2019t have the stature to reach the elite level \u2013 \u201ceveryone has misperceptions that you take a pill and become a champion\u201d \u2013 and soon became obsessed by the \u201cchemistry\u201d of doping. Over time, he learned how athletes could avoid detection and created new undetectable structures of enhancers as well as graduating with a degree in kinesiology. He describes himself as a scientist and athletes would pay up to $20,000-a-year for his advice, plus $40,000 bonuses for significant victories.\n\nAfter testifying against Graham in 2007, Heredia continued to work as a federal witness for USADA \u2013 The Independent has seen copies of emails between Heredia and Novitzky. \u201cI provided data, substances that were undetectable at the time, how to test EPO, a timeline of testing, how doping was done. Because of me a lot of rules have changed in favour of drug detection.\u201d In addition, Heredia identified 26 PEDs used by athletes that were previously undetectable to testing agencies.\n\n\u201cWe make mistakes as humans, we have regrets, we make changes and move on in life,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that God provided me with a different opportunity, he provided me with a job that I loved and a new life. There\u2019s not a day of my life that I don\u2019t remember what I did was wrong, but that\u2019s in the past and I\u2019ve moved on.\n\n\u201cWhat I do nowadays, people know who I am, they know I\u2019ve worked with USADA for years, and they know I don\u2019t condone drug use, one: because I walked away from that many years ago and two: because I don\u2019t want to ruin my credibility.\u201d\n\n***\n\nDuno is in the best shape of his career. Just like every fighter Heredia has worked with, every muscle in his body is amplified, the veins angrier, the definition more pronounced. But, 14 years since being confronted by Novizky, Heredia still can\u2019t escape the \u201cclouds of doubt\u201d. \u201cEverybody will always have a perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand science.\u201d\n\nGoing clean was his salvation; an escape from the paranoid world he straddled. He changed his surname in an attempt to wipe his slate clean and has spent the years since modelling himself as anti-doping\u2019s guardian preacher, criticising lax testing practices, testifying on behalf of those wrongly accused, and pointing officials in the direction of wrongdoing. Currently, he\u2019s working charitably on behalf of a South African boxer who he\u2019s convinced has been wrongly accused.\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, people had their opinions,\u201d Heredia says. \u201cI didn\u2019t come in and expect everyone to believe. But I\u2019ve done a lot for years for anti-doping that nobody has ever done. There\u2019s a lot of ignorance in boxing. People don\u2019t understand the benefits of what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve been in boxing for eight years and none of my boxers have ever tested positive. We\u2019ve always been clean. That was a change of life for me. I have my family and my son. This is what I make for a living and I don\u2019t want to taint it.\u201d\n\nThe rebirth began in 2011 \u2013 two years after Usain Bolt distanced himself from speculation that he\u2019d worked with the coach in the build-up to the World Championships. After being reunited with childhood friend and renowned boxer Jorge Arce, Heredia guided the 6/1 underdog to a world title. Later that same year, he contacted Juan Manuel Marquez, one of Mexico\u2019s all-time great fighters. Over the course of 11 weeks, Heredia transformed Marquez \u201cinto a beast\u201d and in the sixth round, the 36-year-old knocked out Manny Pacquiao in one of the sport\u2019s most memorable upsets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m attacked for my past but, frankly, I\u2019m the cleanest guy in boxing,\u201d he claims. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cheaters in boxing and I don\u2019t blame them because the system is so bad, but in boxing you can kill someone. A few high-profile boxers have approached me trying to get dopes. I tell them I don\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d That hasn\u2019t, however, stopped Heredia from being dogged by a permanent trail of suspicion.\n\nThe Independent has seen correspondence between Heredia and Mauricio Sulaim\u00e1n, the head of the WBC \u2013 one of boxing\u2019s four established governing bodies \u2013 asking him to become an instrumental figure in their Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) Clean Boxing Programme, to help formulate stricter testing and help identify new PEDs being used in the sport. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do the drug testing organisation\u2019s jobs,\u201d he rebuts. \u201cIt\u2019s an endless war. I\u2019m not the one getting paid to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nHeredia is enlightening and combative on the state of doping in sport today, skipping between problems blighting boxing, track and field, and football \u2013 \u201cA lot of problems in soccer,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere are many substances that can leave your body in 48 hours and not enough testing. EPO will leave your system in three days.\u201d\n\nSpeaking days after Christian Coleman claimed the 100m at the World Athletics Championships in Doha with a time of 9.71s, Heredia says there is a \u201cred flag\u201d over the American and that missing three tests is \u201cunacceptable\u201d. USADA decided to drop charges against Coleman due to a technicality over dates. Coleman has since sought a public apology from USADA. Heredia adds that, in his mind, \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt\u201d that a significant number of athletes at the event were using PEDs.\n\n\u201cOn the black market, the drugs are cheaper,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always new chemicals coming out in China, India, supposedly for research purposes. From one structure you can make 20 for research purposes and there\u2019s no data on them. Doping is more sophisticated, it\u2019s harder to detect, the testing isn\u2019t consistent and there\u2019s no transparency. There\u2019s always going to be a question and athletes who are clean will look dirty. It\u2019s a war that is almost impossible to win.\n\n\u201cThe IAAF is always talking about testing. Look at Sebastian Coe, how stupid and ridiculous he looks. I used to respect him as an athlete, I looked up to him as a kid, but he\u2019s never cleaned this sport. What is he talking about? Maybe he cleaned himself when he washed, but not this sport.\u201d\n\nHeredia agrees, in the wake of Alberto Salazar\u2019s ban, that the enticement of large endorsements from the likes of Nike and Adidas \u201cputs pressure\u201d on athletes to deliver results and that training camps in Africa are a circus for suspicion to insiders. \u201cI know many agents who would go to Kenya, sign guys and use enhancements to increase their ability and chase world records. Agents get a percentage. Athletes in Kenya can\u2019t even afford any of those enhancements, especially EPO. There are situations where the agents will abuse people\u2019s ignorance and have athletes use it.\u201d\n\nHe can discuss these issues for hours on end. You also get the sense that there are many more secrets buried, far more things he\u2019s witnessed hidden, that he won\u2019t ever tell to a journalist. In one sense, he\u2019s still cautious, the past forever playing on his mind, still married by reputation to sport\u2019s murkiest corner. On the other, he\u2019s fighting against his past, leading a conflicted crusade for a cleaner sport. A life still encapsulated by sporting success, but no longer waged at all cost. As he looks to guide Duno to an odds-defying upset, he believes he's finally found freedom on the other side of the ropes.", "description": "The resurrection of Angel Heredia was not simple, for one because he fell so far from grace, yet it begins religiously each morning at 5am.
