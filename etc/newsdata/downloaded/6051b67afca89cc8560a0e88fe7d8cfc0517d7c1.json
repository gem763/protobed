The next OPEC meeting, for Saudi Arabia and its ally Russia to try and psyche the market up for a new round of cuts, or higher prices, isn\u2019t until December.\n\nAbundant Output, Dismal Data\n\nAnd unless another supply shock on the scale of the September Saudi oil attack takes place, there is little reason to fear a crude shortage. On the contrary, the world is virtually swimming in oil\u2014if some market pessimists are to be believed\u2014a hypothesis that supports lower prices, rather than higher ones.\n\nAnd then, there\u2019s this growing fear about a U.S. recession, reinforced by last week\u2019s dismal data on both and from the Institute of Supply Management.\n\nIf that isn\u2019t enough, there are perpetual fears of a global slowdown, emanating from the belief that any U.S.-China attempt to reach a trade deal may be doomed. With negotiations between the two sides resuming in Washington this week, reports that China may be slightly hardening its stance jarred with encouraging words by U.S. President Donald Trump and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Friday\u2014and we\u2019ve heard those before.\n\nSaudi Arabia Pumping Just Like Before, But Demand Slowing\n\nDominick Chirichella, director of risk and trading at New York\u2019s Energy Management Institute, summed it up appropriately:\n\n\u201cThe rapid return to full production in Saudi Arabia has moved market participants\u2019 focus back to the potential for a slowdown of the global economy and, thus, a slowing in global oil demand growth.\u201d\n\nBrent 60-Min Chart\n\nAll charts powered by TradingView\n\nChirichella said Friday\u2019s rebound\u2014where crude prices steadied on the day but fell 6% on the week, resulting in Brent\u2019s worst week since mid-July\u2014was more pre-weekend short-covering than a structural change in the complex.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cCrude oil is now trading below the pre-(Saudi) attack level, while refined products are slightly above.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main winner to date is the refining sector, which has seen a strong uplift in refinery crack spreads, and the strong premium in retail gasoline prices over the pre-attack level.\u201d\n\n$2 Trading Range Likely For WTI And Brent\n\nsettled at $52.81 per barrel on Friday after coming less than 5 cents of breaking below $52. If that support is taken out, a descent toward $51 is likely, before a final push for under $50.\n\nUnder current market conditions, WTI at below $50 doesn\u2019t appear sustainable yet, even if there\u2019s another huge weekly build in reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. So a range between $51.80 and $53.80 is likely this week.\n\nsettled at $58.37 on Friday. Similarly, it could trade in a $2 range, at between $57.50 and $59.50.\n\nGold Continues Shining As Yields Fall\n\nIn gold\u2019s case, by Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell that he might want to cut rates again to stop inflation from slipping too low might keep the yellow metal firmly above the $1,500 per ounce support.\n\nfor December delivery settled down 90 cents, or 0.1%, at $1,506.20 per ounce after the Labor Department reported growth of 136,000 in September: below the 140, 000 estimate but enough to help lower the domestic to a 50-year low.\n\nGold 60-Min Chart\n\nSince hitting a two-month low of $1,465 in Tuesday\u2019s intraday trade, gold futures have gained more than $41, or nearly 3%.\n\nFawad Razaqzada, analyst at FOREX.com, said:\n\n\u201cGold (is) continuing to shine brightly in these turbulent times due, among other things, to higher demand for haven assets,\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso supporting the precious metal is a falling and rising bond prices\u2014or put in another way, falling yields\u2014as this is boosting the appeal of non interest-bearing assets like gold and .\u201d\n\nThird Rate Cut Of 2019 Expected, Despite A Drop In Odds\n\nPowell said on Friday that the Fed was examining strategies that might help it to symmetrically and sustainably achieve 2% inflation.\n\nOn Friday, the odds of a rate cut in October from 87% a day earlier, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool\u2014though they re-gained some ground, to 80.2%, by Monday's European morning session.\n\nSo far this year, the Fed has conducted two quarter point rate cuts, back-to-back in July and September, to try and preserve the U.S. economy' record decade-long growth. The Fed Oct 28-29 to consider a third rate cut.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, XAG/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures.
