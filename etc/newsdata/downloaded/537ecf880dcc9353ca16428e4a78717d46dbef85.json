I loved magazines, but I always skipped the beauty pages. The voices behind them didn\u2019t speak to me. The faces on the pages didn\u2019t look like me. The products weren\u2019t geared towards me. I had no place there. Growing up, I had always heard my Nigerian parents and their friends say: \u201cThis is not our country.\u201d And so, despite being British, I parked any expectation to be included in the beauty industry. It never occurred to me that I could be a part of this world, let alone driving change from within.\n\nWhen I started writing about beauty, almost 15 years ago, it was nothing to do with race. My reasons were pragmatic. I was a freelance fashion writer, work had dried up, so I turned my hand to writing everything and anything because at that time, in the timeless words of Gwen Guthrie, Ain\u2019t Nothing Going on But the Rent. And I was irked by the way beauty was written \u2013 fluffy and asinine, as if for one-dimensional airheads. I made a conscious decision to go against that. Unconsciously, however, my foray into the beauty world was driven by my blackness and the industry\u2019s rejection of it. My route to realising that was surprising, even to me.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white blows my mind\u2019: Pat McGrath, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist. Photograph: Rabbani and Solimene Photography/WireImage\n\nIn February 2017, to coincide with Black History Month in the US, CNN launched a project inspired by WEB DuBois\u2019s The Souls of Black Folks, a literary classic that talks about race and ethnicity in America. Du Bois wrote about the first time his skin colour made him realise he was different. CNN chronicled a number of high profile people of colour revealing their own personal \u201cmoment\u201d. It was called \u201cThe First Time I Realised I Was Black.\u201d I pondered this, wondering what my answer would be.\n\nI was born in St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, London, and grew up by the Albert Embankment. We weren\u2019t posh. We lived in a council house that happened to be in Zone 1. In the early 80s, when I was five, we moved to Lagos, Nigeria. I don\u2019t recall a single conversation there where anyone discussed being black. There were conversations about politics, which we studied in school. There were conversations about class, a residue of colonialism. And there were conversations about skin tone. (Centuries of being brainwashed to believe the fairer-skinned are superior and should, therefore, be more favoured \u2013 particularly if their facial features mimic Eurocentric ideals of beauty \u2013 has had a rippling effect. Ever wondered why the bestselling black female artists are Rhianna and Beyonc\u00e9?) But this was the closest we came to discussing \u201cblackness\u201d. Which was why, when I returned to London five years later, I still did not consider myself \u201cblack\u201d. But goodness, I soon found out just how \u201cother\u201d I was.\n\nAt school, a mixed comprehensive, I was the \u201cAfrican\u201d. Children spat out the word in repulsion. Teachers would speak to me slowly as if English wasn\u2019t my first language. Someone once called me \u201cBlack Attack\u201d because of my dark skin. I had short hair (I needed a hairstyle with minimal upkeep because I\u2019d attended a boarding school in Nigeria.) My TWA (Teeny Weeny Afro) became a taking point. I remember someone sniggering that I looked like Kunta Kinte, the central character in Alex Haley\u2019s Roots, viciously taken from his African village and sold into slavery. At swimming classes, I was the girl who \u201cdidn\u2019t need arm bands because her rubber lips would help her float\u201d. I am strangely sadder about those words now than I was then. I now see the depth and layers of hate from which this ignorance stems. As a young girl, I couldn\u2019t articulate my feelings beyond thinking: \u201cThis white boy is really horrible to me and thinks he is really funny.\u201d Even so, these experiences made me feel \u201cdifferent\u201d, but they were not signifiers of my blackness. I discovered that in something much more pedestrian: a trip to the chemist.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cultural icons, speaking for change and representation in the industry: Edward Enninful, Rihanna and Naomi Campbell at the 2014 British Fashion Awards. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images\n\nWhen I hit adolescence, I begun to get interested in beauty, not as a potential vocation, but to attract boys and to tackle my confidence-crippling acne. I\u2019d surreptitiously take from my mother\u2019s stash of lipsticks \u2013 coloured bullets she\u2019d pick up from random stalls and stores in Brixton. The quality stretched from OK to diabolical. But I didn\u2019t care. I would swipe it across my lips and head into school convinced I epitomised sophistication.\n\nOne day, I walked into the local pharmacy with my Caucasian friends to scope the beauty offering. While my friends giggled excitedly about their finds, everything I tried either left an ashy finish or just didn\u2019t show up \u2013 the pigments weren\u2019t strong enough. Still I persevered, because at that age, aren\u2019t we all desperate to be part of the collective? I moved towards the foundations and chose the darkest shade. It was called \u201cBiscuit\u201d. I looked like I had white chalk on my skin. I laughed to hide my embarrassment but, at that moment, everything changed. Suddenly colour mattered, in more ways than one. This is when I realised I was black. It was like I had turned up to a party to which I was not invited. I felt irrelevant, excluded and ashamed. The message from the beauty industry was loud and clear: I was not valuable enough to be part of the conversation.\n\nIn the years that followed, there were a few lights in the tunnel. I remember the first time I saw Naomi Campbell in Vogue. I was mesmerised. She looked like me \u2013 as far as skin colour went at least. In truth, she fitted into what the industry see as the acceptable face of black. But she was black and that was enough for me. It gave me hope.\n\nThere were other key moments. After years of accepting and wearing foundations that were not made for my skin, I discovered MAC in the 90s. Their Studio Fix Foundation was a game changer. This mainstream brand was arguably the first to create foundations covering a wide spectrum of hues. I would go as far as saying it changed the lives of beauty-loving black women. It was the first foundation I wore that made me feel beautiful.\n\nThe rise of Pat McGrath, the world\u2019s most influential makeup artist, also had an impact on how I viewed beauty. Even now, watching this British-born black woman navigate a very white space and reach the top of the game blows my mind. Still, the culture of silence around the lack of products available to darker skin types remained.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Happy in my skin: Funmi Fetto wears dress by Preen by Thornton Bregazzi, mytheresa.com. Photograph: David Titlow/The Observer\n\nThere are those who may think: \u201cIt\u2019s just beauty, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Makeup and skincare are powerful tools that have helped me cope with difficult moments in my life. In my youth, acne plagued my skin and carried on long after I grew out of my teens. It killed my confidence. The discovery of a decent facial (Eve Lom was my first love \u2013 one of the few brands that knew how to treat darker skin), an incredible mask from Dr Sebagh, and moisturisers from Institut Esthederm restored it.\n\nYears later, when my premature son was seriously ill in intensive care, my daily hint of blush, slick of lip colour and touch of mascara provided a sense of normality when everything around me felt scarily precarious. So, no, it isn\u2019t just beauty. It holds a power that is not always tangible but, trust me, it\u2019s there.\n\nFast forward. It\u2019s 2019. There are moments when I sense an exciting shift taking place in the beauty industry. Along with sustainability, diversity and inclusivity seem to be at the top of every agenda. Whether this will extend beyond a trend or box-ticking exercise remains to be seen, but for now it\u2019s welcome. Foundation ranges suitable for all shades are omnipresent. In fact, thanks to the incredibly successful product launch of Rihanna\u2019s Fenty Beauty, which addressed the whitewashing of the beauty industry, any brands now launching with fewer than 40 shades of foundation are seen to be slacking.\n\nI believe the boldness in calling out a lack of inclusivity stems from cultural icons in powerful positions speaking out. From Naomi Campbell to Beyonc\u00e9 to Oprah Winfrey to Rihanna to Edward Enninful\u2026 Hearing them addressing issues of race has given so many people a voice. There still exists, of course, the tone-deaf brands that don\u2019t believe darker-skinned women are their \u201caudience\u201d and have purposely limited their foundation colours. Thankfully, there are other foundations to cater for everyone. Preferences may vary based on texture, finish and skincare benefits, but the market is now so vast, \u201cthe one\u201d is lurking out there somewhere.\n\nThe issue is not really about foundations. It is about representation and equality\n\nThat said, the issue is not really about foundations. It is about representation and equality. I have had countless women of colour approach me via social media, at dinner parties, on the streets, to ask me for product recommendations. Their ages span from 16 to 80. They cover the spectrum of class. They come from all walks of life \u2013 school-gate mothers, students, high-flying executives, fashion stylists. If all of these women are struggling to find products and beauty \u201cprofessionals\u201d still don\u2019t know what to do with darker skin and Afro hair, then the beauty industry, retailers, brands, marketers and, yes, even editors, are failing them. When I told a friend that I planned to write a book on widely available and easily accessible products and brands women of colour should have on their radar, she was flummoxed: \u201cHow are you going to fill that book? There\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d Ah, but there is. It\u2019s not perfect, but a mindshift in marketing and media could make a significant difference.\n\nMost beauty journalism still assumes readers are white. Cosmetic brands are making an effort in their marketing, but most skincare brands are not \u2013 by only featuring white women in their campaigns, they also assume their audience and consumer is white. At the majority of the big beauty companies, all the key decision-makers are white, which invariably informs what ends up on advertising material. I have to ignore that homogeneity in order to discover gems. Black women not in my position don\u2019t have that advantage and assume \u201cit\u2019s not for us\u201d.\n\nThis seems like a commercial misstep. A few years ago, a Nielsen report in the US found that black women spend nearly nine times more than their Caucasian counterparts on hair and beauty \u2013 mainly on niche brands targeting this demographic; brands that are generally sold in beauty supply stores in \u201cethnic\u201d areas. If this survey were conducted on this side of the Atlantic, I\u2019m convinced the results would be no different. A significant amount of this spend goes on black-hair products, yet the mainstream hair industry remains the least inclusive part of the beauty industry.\n\nThe mainstream hair industry remains the least inclusive part of the beauty industry\n\nAt a recent beauty industry dinner, I complimented a fellow editor on her hair. She told me she\u2019d just had it done at a high profile salon loved, lauded and frequented by every beauty editor I know. I had never been, I admitted. Another editor overheard and was aghast. \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve never been?\u201d she said. In my head, I responded: \u201cI can barely find suitable hair products from mainstream hair brands, let alone finding \u2018white\u2019 salons or stylists to cater for my hair. Most approach my coily texture with trepidation, as if a pet alien has just sprouted from my scalp. Or they view it as an unruly beast that requires bashing into submission. Or, I\u2019m simply turned away. And so for the sake of my self and hair preservation, I now stick to black-hair stylists, or those situated in so-called ethnic areas, who don\u2019t find my hair such a terrifying aberration.\u201d\n\nBut I didn\u2019t say that, because I didn\u2019t have the energy. I have had these conversations many times before. They are exhausting. So instead I simply shrugged and said: \u201cI don\u2019t go because they don\u2019t do Afro hair.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she mused, \u201cI never thought about that.\u201d Of course she hadn\u2019t. This is an advantage afforded by white privilege. It is a small privilege, but a privilege nonetheless. It is a privilege I don\u2019t have. So, despite the current talk of diversity and inclusivity, I am constantly reminded we are not there yet. While it\u2019s wonderful that I can now find a base that won\u2019t turn me deathly grey or cantaloupe orange, in order to really move forward, the beauty industry needs to start having conversations that go deeper than the shades of foundation.\n\nPalette: The Beauty Bible for Women of Colour by Funmi Fetto (Hodder & Stoughton, \u00a325), is out on 3 October.

It is an exquisite hydrator, one of the few hair products that claims to be \u201csuitable for all hair textures\u201d and actually delivers on Afro hair. It smells really coconutty, though I\u2019m not even sure it has coconut in it. But it does contain vitamin E, UV protection, and lychee extract\n\nto protect hair.\n\nGlow to go: skin highlighter\n\nBecca Shimmering Skin Perfector Liquid Highlighter, \u00a330, johnlewis.co.uk A magnificent highlighter. It comes in different textures \u2013 the liquid version has been described as soft focus in a bottle. I use Topaz on a daily basis because it fools people into thinking you have the best skin in the world. It\u2019s glossy. And it has no glitter in it, which can look ridiculous.\n\nGently effective: capital cleanser\n\nSunday Riley Ceramic Slip, \u00a328, spacenk.com Nearly everyone who gave a five-star review of this cleanser was white, so for a long time I didn\u2019t try it. Also, if I hear something is \u201cgentle\u201d, what I really hear is: \u201cHey guys, I don\u2019t do very much.\u201d But this is phenomenal \u2013 a silky gel that gives a deep clean without drying the skin.\n\nLash out: miracle mascara\n\nStila Huge Extreme Lash Mascara, \u00a319, stila.co.uk As you age, your lashes will go from being a fan of feathers to pitiful stumps of nothing. What\u2019s scary is that you\u2019ll have no idea when it\u2019ll happen. If you don\u2019t want to spend your life buried under false lashes, what\u2019s the alternative? Well, this. The clue is in the word \u2013 huge. With this mascara, you see an immediate lift with one coat. It won\u2019t clump your lashes. And, thanks to conditioners, it doesn\u2019t crisp. Always a good thing.\n\nLip service: liquid colour\n\nLime Crime Liquid Lipstick, \u00a318, boots.com Not all liquids lipsticks are made equal. Some are so thick and unyielding they drag across your lips; others are so flimsy that you would struggle to get a consistent colour pay-off, and many leave you with a cracked dryness that feels like a sprinkling of pencil shavings. Lime Crime joins a coterie of brands I feel have perfected the liquid lipstick; the texture is a velvety matte that glides on effortlessly. It feels so light and conditioning, and the pigment packs a punch.\n\nThe cheek of it: blushes all round\n\nNARS Blush, \u00a325, narscosmetics.co.uk Nars calls itself \u201cthe ultimate authority in blush\u201d, and I get it. There is no colour, finish or texture that you can\u2019t find under its wing. \u201cOrgasm\u201d is probably its most famous product, a pinky-gold shimmery powder with a silky finish. On dark skins, you\u2019d struggle to get a true representation of colour. Taj Mahal (a shimmering burnt-orange) might fare better, especially if you were going to wear foundation.\n\nBrighten up: splash-out serum\n\nZelens Brightening Serum, \u00a3135, net-a-porter.com I had a conversation recently with a fellow journalist as to how much is too much for a beauty product. Some people are addicted to expensive products. I think most are placebos, that with advanced formulations it is possible to find cheaper alternatives. But there are exceptions. This is one. Yes, there\u2019s only 30ml in a bottle. But it is above and beyond the many brightening serums I\u2019ve used.\n\nRed-wine glow: a better complexion\n\nNeogen Peeling Pads, \u00a327, net-a-porter.com Exfoliating pads soaked in wine. Not the drinking kind, but the kind that revolutionises your skin. The star ingredient is resveratrol, an antioxidant derivative of red wine that sloughs off dead skin cells, protects your skin from pigmentation and premature ageing, declogs pores and gives you a brighter complexion. If you asked for more, it would be greedy. Plus, the smell! Nostalgically sweet, fruity and juicy.\n\nSun smart: best of a brand\n\nGlossier Invisible Shield, \u00a320, glossier.com I love Glossier. But do I use all the range? Embarrassingly, no. I love the idea of Glossier. I love the ethos. I love the authentic sense of community the brand has created. And I love the clever, forward-thinking way they operate. There is one product in the Glossier line-up that I use more than anything else: the sunscreen. It\u2019s superb, and, as the name states, invisible. Not only does it protect skin from the sun, the ingredient list \u2013 vitamin E, broccoli and aloe leaf \u2013 reads like an ode to antioxidants.\n\nSmooth talk: excellent exfoliant\n\nPaula\u2019s Choice Liquid Exfoliant, \u00a328, cultbeauty.co.uk This liquid exfoliator is possibly the product I\u2019ve recommended the most.
