And you will be extremely shocked at the numbers many, many times what you think,\" Trump said, speaking to reporters outside the White House as he left for a trip to North Carolina.\n\nAndrew Harnik/AP\n\nThe president, of course, has continued to refuse to release his tax returns. House Democrats investigating Trump's finances are demanding that his tax returns be turned over, as well as other details about his and his family's holdings.\n\nTrump was asked about the Pentagon's use of his properties for overnight stays while Air Force planes are refueled, but he says his financial reports will show he doesn't need the money.
