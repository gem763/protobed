Here, all of the worst fears of Trumpian foreign policy\u2014its transactional underpinnings; its disdain of even the basics of democratic facades\u2014are realized. Together, they threaten one of the core tenets of broader American geopolitical strategy: backing anyone trying to counter Russia\u2019s hegemonic designs, especially those whose governments can boast democratic underpinnings.\n\n\u201cUkraine is now facing the prospect of becoming a double victim: on the one hand, a victim of Mr. Putin\u2019s aggression; on the other, a victim of Mr. Trump\u2019s desire to be re-elected at any price,\u201d wrote New Europe Center president Alyona Getmanchuk in The New York Times this week. Or, as Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center\u2014a leading light among Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption figures\u2014added this month, there\u2019s one \u201cultimate beneficiary\u201d of Giuliani and Trump\u2019s machinations: Russia.\n\nTrump may be following Giuliani\u2019s lead (which has already led the president straight to an impeachment inquiry), but Ukraine is far from the only country in Eastern Europe that Giuliani has laid his grubby paws on over the past year, all in pursuit of upending the gains made in fighting corruption, and the Kremlin. Look at Armenia, for instance. Just last year, Giuliani touched down in Yerevan\u2014claiming, as recently stated with regard to his Biden exploit, to be working in his private capacity and not as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer\u2014in order to attend something called the Eurasian Week conference. While there, Giuliani decided that it would be a good idea to share a speaking stage with Sergei Glazyev, a sanctioned Russian official who had himself helped organize pro-Russian protests in Ukraine, and who has previously worked closely with American anti-Semites.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s speech was, as one attendee told this reporter, \u201ctotal bullshit.\u201d But while there, Giuliani not only became the highest-profile American to glad-hand with a sanctioned Russian official since the first rounds of sanctions rained down some five years ago\u2014effectively undercutting the purpose of sanctions in the first place\u2014he also distinguished himself as the most prominent American official to call for closer relations with the Eurasian Economic Union, one of the Kremlin\u2019s primary geopolitical projects. Where previous officials like Hillary Clinton rightly pointed out that the Eurasian Economic Union was little more than a neo-imperial scheme aimed at shoring up Russian hegemony, Giuliani saw it as something for the U.S. to encourage\u2014and to work with moving forward.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s misadventures also brought his designs to Romania as well. Thanks to the efforts of a single-minded prosecutor, Romania\u2019s anti-corruption efforts have gained significant headway in the past few years, a welcome change in one of the most corrupt countries of the European Union. Giuliani, however, had contrary thoughts\u2014to his mind, Romania had been too effective in cleaning up the corruption corroding its public services. In a 2018 letter to Romania\u2019s president, Giuliani wrote that Romania\u2019s anti-corruption drive had led to \u201cexcesses,\u201d and that there should be an amnesty for those caught up in the anti-corruption dragnet. Needless to say, Giuliani\u2019s beliefs were in direct contradiction to American policy, and undercut the ongoing effort to counter dirty money and corrupt practices throughout the West.\n\nGiuliani had never expressed an interest in Romanian anti-corruption efforts prior to his out-of-left-field letter, making that missive that much more curious. But it didn\u2019t take long to connect the dots. Giuliani quickly admitted that he\u2019d written the letter at the behest of former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose consulting firm just so happened to be representing notorious Romanian clients on the wrong end of the anti-corruption drive. One of those buoyed by Giuliani\u2019s efforts: Liviu Dragnea, the former head of Romania\u2019s Social Democratic Party, who was recently jailed on charges of corruption. \u201cGiuliani is a famous federal prosecutor of the United States, who has fought with the mafia and corruption, and whose moral and professional probity commands respect all over the world,\u201d Dragnea claimed in response to Giuliani\u2019s efforts.\n\nDespite his denials, Giuliani is perceived by all in his path as little more than a foot soldier for Trump.\n\nDragnea\u2019s encomium about Giuliani was ultimately of little use; earlier this month, the U.S. State Department barred the crooked politico from visiting the U.S., specifically citing his \u201cinvolvement in significant corruption.\u201d But by then, the damage\u2014just as in Ukraine, just as in Armenia\u2014had already been done. Despite his denials, Giuliani is perceived by all in his path as little more than a foot soldier for Trump. His autocrat-friendly outlook and his campaigns to undercut the effort to stem the tide of corruption across Eastern Europe are unfortunately taking root as America\u2019s de facto position.\n\nRemarkably, all of Giuliani\u2019s efforts have taken place only over the past 12 months. And given the eagerness with which Trump and his cronies have glommed onto some of these lines of attack, most especially with Biden and Ukraine, there\u2019s little reason to think that Giuliani\u2019s efforts across Eastern Europe will stop anytime soon. This is a travesty, verging on tragedy, for both those who live in the region, as well as for those involved in the larger effort to help the region onto a stable and democratic footing.\n\nThirty years ago, a Republican administration tried to stall Ukrainians\u2019 demands for independence, and for sovereignty. Today, a Republican administration\u2014with Giuliani apparently as its mouthpiece\u2014is trying to do much the same. It didn\u2019t work then, and perhaps history will kindly repeat itself now. But the damage to America\u2019s reputation, and to America\u2019s interests, has begun. As long as Giuliani continues down the path he\u2019s chosen, with an eager U.S. president in tow, the debasement won\u2019t end anytime soon.", "description": "The Ukraine scandal that's engulfed the Trump White House is the culmination of the former New York City mayor's Eastern European misadventures.", "authors": ["Casey Michel"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/ff653277edf9b164e2a4a37402f1d600dec724f6.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
