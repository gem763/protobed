Then came dozens of rounds of tear gas and a government that refused to back down. In the following weeks and months, the city was roiled by protests and violent clashes, as the demonstrations morphed into a broader movement about political reforms and holding the police accountable.\n\nSHENZHEN Locations of protests Yuen Long HONG KONG Sha Tin Sham Shui Po Airport Tsim Sha Tsui Mainland government Liaison Office Legislative Council Complex SHENZHEN Locations of protests Yuen Long HONG KONG Sha Tin Sham Shui Po Airport Tsim Sha Tsui Mainland government Liaison Office Legislative Council Complex SHENZHEN Locations of protests Yuen Long HONG KONG Sha Tin Sham Shui Po Airport Tsim Sha Tsui Legislative Council Complex Mainland government Liaison Office\n\nThese are the critical moments that have defined the Hong Kong protests:\n\nJune 9 First Large March Reuters\n\nThough there had already been two protests against a proposed law that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, the scale of popular discontent became clear on June 9. That day, more than a million \u2014 or nearly one in seven Hong Kong residents \u2014 took to the streets, according to protest organizers.\n\nJune 12 First Use of Tear Gas Reuters\n\nThousands of people surrounded Hong Kong\u2019s Legislative Council. The legislature, where pro-Beijing lawmakers have a majority, was expected to debate the bill.\n\nProtesters threw bricks, bottles and umbrellas at police officers, leading to a police response that some demonstrators called excessive. The use of pepper spray, batons and particularly tear gas infuriated many Hong Kong residents.\n\nThe clashes began a sharp escalation in violence, and the lawmakers postponed debate on the bill.\n\nI now announce that the government has decided to suspend the legislative amendment exercise. Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, June 15\n\nJune 16 Largest March in Hong Kong\u2019s History EyePress Images\n\nAngered by the police response, as many as two million people marched in defiance of the government, according to organizers\u2019 estimates.\n\nIn addition to seeing the bill withdrawn, protesters added a new demand: an independent investigation into the use of force by the police.\n\nI offer my most sincere apology to all people of Hong Kong. Carrie Lam, June 18\n\nJuly 1 Break-In at the Legislative Council Orlando De Guzman/The New York Times\n\nHundreds of thousands of protesters marched peacefully on the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese sovereignty. But a smaller group of several hundred demonstrators stormed the Legislative Council, smashing windows and vandalizing the building.\n\nSome defaced portraits, spray-painted slogans and destroyed surveillance cameras. In graffiti, someone wrote, \u201cIt was the government who taught us that peaceful protest is useless.\u201d\n\nBy now, the protesters had more demands, including universal suffrage; amnesty for demonstrators who had been arrested; and retracting officials\u2019 characterization of the June 12 protest as a \u201criot.\u201d\n\nThere are still lingering doubts about whether the government will restart the bill. There is no such plan. The bill is dead. Carrie Lam, July 9\n\nDriven by anger at the police and at the territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who had shelved the bill but refused to withdraw it completely, demonstrators again took to the streets.\n\nAs clashes between protesters and the police grew more frequent, protests began to spread to neighborhoods far from the government\u2019s downtown offices.\n\nJuly 14 Clashes in Sha Tin Reuters\n\nOn July 14, after a peaceful march and a tense standoff with the police in the Sha Tin area, riot police officers charged a shopping mall where protesters were gathered, catching casual shoppers and diners in the fray. The images of peaceful shoppers frantically running from the police led to hundreds of people protesting near the mall in the following days.\n\nJuly 21 Mob Attack in Yuen Long Reuters\n\nDemonstrators returning from a night of protesting to their homes in the Yuen Long neighborhood were attacked at a train station by dozens of men wearing masks and white shirts. Some of the attackers were later identified as members of organized crime groups. The police were slow to respond to the scene and made no arrests that night, fueling speculation that they were cooperating with criminal gangs.\n\nAug. 5 800 Rounds of Tear Gas in One Day Reuters\n\nFurious at the police and frustrated by the government\u2019s inaction, protesters mounted a new challenge by trying to bring the city to a halt. They staged a general strike, disrupting more than 200 flights, occupying shopping malls and blocking roads and rail lines in seven districts.\n\nThe police cracked down hard, firing 800 rounds of tear gas and arresting scores of people.\n\nThose who play with fire will perish by it. At the end of the day, they will eventually be punished. Yang Guang, spokesperson for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Aug. 6\n\nAug. 7 Laser Pointer Protest Over Student\u2019s Arrest Reuters\n\nThe protesters have devised savvy ways to use everyday objects in their clashes with the police: suitcases as shields, traffic cones to contain tear gas canisters and laser pointers to harass officers.\n\nOn Aug. 6, the police, who said the laser pointers were \u201coffensive weapons,\u201d arrested Keith Fong, the president of the Hong Kong Baptist University student union, for possessing several of the devices. He was later released without being charged.\n\nThe arrest drew hundreds of protesters the next night to a police station in the Sham Shui Po neighborhood to demand his release, and the police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. The next day protesters put on a laser show during a demonstration near the Hong Kong Space Museum.\n\nAug. 11 Woman Shot in the Eye Reuters\n\nA day of protests across the city ended with a woman being struck in the eye by a projectile, believed to have been fired by the police. The police asserted that there was no evidence linking officers to the woman\u2019s injury, and later announced that they had launched a formal inquiry. The woman became a symbol of the protests, and many demonstrators wore eye patches in her honor.\n\nAlso that night, the police fired tear gas toward protesters inside a subway station, violating safety guidelines.\n\n[Protesters\u2019] deeds have constituted severe violent crimes and showed the tendency of turning to terrorism. Yang Guang, Aug. 12\n\nAug. 13 Chaos at the Airport Reuters\n\nProtesters raised the stakes again, shutting down air traffic with a dayslong demonstration at Hong Kong\u2019s airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest.\n\nSome protesters tied up and beat two men from mainland China. They suspected one of being a security officer, and the other turned out to be a reporter for a state-run Chinese newspaper. Protesters later apologized. The Chinese authorities denounced the violence as \u201cclose to terrorism.\u201d\n\nAug. 18 March in the Rain Reuters\n\nAs many as 1.7 million protesters marched peacefully through Hong Kong\u2019s city center, according to organizers, in a sign of the movement\u2019s sustained strength.\n\nIt marked a period of quiet, after the havoc at the airport and criticism of the protesters\u2019 behavior there. The weekend passed without a single tear gas canister being fired.\n\nAug. 31 Escalating Violence Reuters; Pakkin Leung@Rice Post via Storyful\n\nChaos returned on the fifth anniversary of China\u2019s 2014 proposal to limit direct elections in Hong Kong. Demonstrators set fires to barricades and brawled with the police. Some threw bricks and firebombs at officers. As government helicopters flew overhead, the police fired tear gas and pepper spray at protesters and blasted them with water cannons loaded with blue dye, to mark them for later arrest.\n\nThe government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns. Carrie Lam, Sept. 4\n\nMrs. Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, announced that the government would formally withdraw the extradition bill, giving in to one of the protesters\u2019 major demands. But it was far from clear that it would be enough to quell the movement, or to satisfy Hong Kongers who have called for more ambitious change. The next weekend, the protests continued.\n\nSept. 11 \u2018Glory to Hong Kong\u2019 Black Blorchestra\n\nWritten and composed anonymously, then modified in online forums used by protesters, \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d was rapidly adopted as an anthem of the pro-democracy movement, replacing the previously popular \u201cSing Hallelujah to the Lord\u201d and \u201cDo You Hear the People Sing,\u201d which was heard often during the 2014 Occupy protests.\n\nIn a slickly produced video for the new song, an orchestra and choir appear in typical protest outfits \u2014 black shirts, helmets, goggles and gas masks.\n\nOct.1 First Police Shooting of a Protester Campus TV, University of Hong Kong\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong escalated after the police shot a protester for the first time with a live round on the same day that China was celebrating 70 years of Communist Party rule.\n\nThat day, protesters clashed with riot police officers in at least nine districts, turning Hong Kong into a tear gas-engulfed battlefield.", "description": "The protests started as peaceful marches and rallies against an unpopular bill.
