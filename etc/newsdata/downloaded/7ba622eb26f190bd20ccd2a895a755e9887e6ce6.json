Right: The entire ECM Records catalogue is being played nonstop at the exhibit as part of the piece \u201cSmall Places.\u201d [HYUNDAI CARD]\n\nMost millennials listen to music through streaming services, making it less likely for them to stop and take a moment to enjoy the album art or the minute details of the music they are listening to. Despite the change in listening habits, there\u2019s one record label that has pertinaciously produced albums that come with a look as distinctive as the music inside since its establishment in 1969.Munich-based record label ECM, founded by its still de-facto art director Manfred Eicher, celebrates its 50-year anniversary this year. To mark this special occasion, ECM decided to put on an exhibition in Seoul in conjunction with Hyundai Card, a company that has organized some of Korea\u2019s biggest music-related events over the past few years.Both companies insist that their \u201cRE:ECM\u201d exhibition, which kicked off at the Hyundai Card Storage in Hannam-dong, central Seoul, on Oct. 18, is something that has never been seen before.\u201cHyundai Card is known for hosting many Super Concerts and has its own Music Library and a wide collection of vinyl,\u201d said an official from the company, \u201cbut this is in fact the company\u2019s first music exhibition. We decided to work with ECM and celebrate its 50th anniversary because we believe ECM is a record label that has become almost like a music genre unto itself and continues to influence people without falling behind in this rapidly changing world.\u201dECM has been holding various exhibitions in cities around the world over the past years. But according to Chung Seon, an ECM producer who is also widely known to Koreans as the second son of famed maestro Chung Myung-whun, \u201c\u2018RE:ECM\u2019 is different from all of the previous ones.\u201d\u201cInstead of communicating through ECM\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Chung Seon, \u201cthis time it\u2019s turning things around and communicating through a listeners\u2019 perspective. We\u2019ve selected six art groups to reinterpret ECM\u2019s impact on the history of contemporary music in their own ways and unveil their variations. We hope this will start various conversations, not only about music, musicians and the history of the ECM itself, but also about the culture of listening to music.\u201dThe exhibition features the entire ECM Records music catalogue since Jan. 1, 1970 - a total of nearly 1,600 albums. In Hyundai Card Storage\u2019s basement floor, all of ECM\u2019s albums, from the very first to the most recent, are currently being played nonstop, even when the space is closed. This section of the museum is \u201cSmall Places,\u201d created by German sound designer Mathis Nitschke.According to Nitschke, the idea was to create a sound installation where the listening visitor becomes an art object on a slightly raised stage designed to look like a Ping-Pong table. There are more than 1,550 albums and it will take almost two months to play them all.At noon on Oct. 18, when the exhibit opened, the Small Places piece began playing ECM Records\u2019 very first track off of its very first album, \u201cFree at last\u201d by the Mal Waldron Trio. Visitors can check out what music is playing at the museum by going to the work\u2019s website (www.smallplaces.art).Nitschke said he was inspired by a famous photograph of pianist Keith Jarrett and Eicher playing Ping-Pong together during a break from recording. The photograph, which was taken by ECM Records\u2019 sound engineer Peter Laenger, is also displayed in this section.\u201cI wanted to use Ping-Pong as a metaphor for producing music,\u201d said Nitschike, who visited Seoul for the exhibition. \u201cPing-Pong and music have similarities as both require communication between [two people]; music needs a listener and so on. There\u2019s this spontaneous oddity and the sense of \u2018being in the moment.\u2019\u201dOn the upper floor, visitors can see the rest of the artworks on display, including American artist Rick Myers\u2019 piece titled \u201cRecollection 1969-2019,\u201d which is comprised of a visual array of light that uses the original ECM logotype as its source. There\u2019s also British artist Sam Winston\u2019s \u201cBetween noise and sound,\u201d in which the artist worked on while listening to four songs from John Cage\u2019s album \u201cAs It Is\u201d released by ECM. The artist listened to the songs on repeat and recorded his responses to each of them in a drawing.\u201cI want to introduce my work with a quote by Gertrude Stein. She said, \u2018A writer should write with his eyes and a painter paint with his ears.\u2019 In this contemporary world, we usually consume music as a piece of digital culture. It\u2019s very quick. But I think ECM treats music as an invitation to go deeper into the act of listening,\u201d said Winston. \u201cSo I decided to go with this particular artwork to show the process of going deeper into the music. It shows a different way of listening to John Cage\u2019s music.\u201dIn a darker room separated with a curtain, there\u2019s Lars Ullrich and Nitschke\u2019s video artwork \u201cFlow.\u201d Visitors can take a seat and listen to ECM\u2019s music and watch a 3-D animation on the screen created by the two artists. According to Nitschke, the movements on the screen are \u201cresponding to the music by analyzing it, which can also be heard by the visitors through the earphones.\u201d\u201cAt the core of ECM\u2019s music lies the idea of horizontal development, that music never stops flowing and developing,\u201d the artist said. \u201cThat there\u2019s a constant stream of time. This installation lets visitors experience this horizontal development by involving them in an analysis and visualization of the inner flow of music through digital animations.\u201dThe colors that are being used for the 3-D objects on the screen, according to the artist, are taken from the colors of the specific album cover of the music that is being played.Korean artist Seo Hyun-suk also participated in the exhibition with a work that requires participation. While viewing \u201cParallel Lines,\u201d visitors are required to go into a dark room wearing a VR headset. Here, visitors can listen to an imaginary dialogue between Eicher and an unknown musician inside a car.According to Seo, although the conversation is fabricated, the excerpts are all from interviews from Eicher and various artists of ECM including Keith Jarrett, Arvo Part and Jan Garbarek.\u201cI wanted to show the thinking behind ECM music,\u201d said Seo.In the final section of the exhibit, visitors will encounter \u201cMurmuration,\u201d an installation that encompasses a retrospective of about 220 selected ECM album covers printed on transparent material.Created by London-based creative group MMBP, this installation of transparent album covers hover above the gallery floor, allowing visitors to be able to \u201cfully appreciate Eicher\u2019s process of creation, which is methodical, precise yet fluid and organic.\u201dBY YIM SEUNG-HYE [sharon@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22185248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
