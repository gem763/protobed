But the England manager can sound like he has been cribbing from Karl Marx when he talks about his football team. There is a minute difference, rather than Marx\u2019s \u2018constant revolution\u2019 Southgate wants \u2018constant evolution\u2019, but the ultimate aim is the same: the conquering of state power by the proletariat (or winning the World Cup, whichever comes first).\n\nSouthgate goes into the next round of European Championship qualifiers this weekend having evolved his Lions once more. The absence of Kyle Walker, justified on the slightly unconvincing premise that Kieran Trippier needed to be reacquainted with the squad after 10 months\u2019 absence, has been the main talking point. But there are other names missing too and, in total, only 11 players from the 2018 World Cup squad have been selected for the fixtures against Bulgaria and Kosovo.\n\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain: \u2018Pub visit reminded me what England means to fans\u2019 Read more\n\nIn this case the evolution will be televised, but what is it hoping to achieve? Straightforwardly, Southgate has further rejuvenated his squad. The average age has come down by nigh-on a year since the World Cup and the aim is to give players inexperienced at this level time to bed in before the Euros. (By the way, if that sounds a little bit presumptive, the chances of England not qualifying for next summer\u2019s 24-team tournament are about the same as Graeme Souness being named chairman of the Paul Pogba fan club.)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep evolving as a squad and as a team,\u201d is Southgate\u2019s view. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a two-year period of progress and constant improvement, I think. But we can\u2019t stand still and there are young players coming through that we might not see the best of in the next two years actually, but for the long term for England we need to start integrating them because I think this team can constantly improve and evolve.\u201d\n\nSo players such as Mason Mount, James Maddison and Tyrone Mings will be put through their paces, exposed to all the motivational slogans of St George\u2019s Park and welcomed properly into the England family. But does this evolution consist of more than just teeing up the next generation? There is reason to suspect it might.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gareth Southgate seems to be intent on tweaking England\u2019s style. Photograph: Paul Currie for The FA/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt is not just the personnel that has changed dramatically during Gareth Southgate\u2019s time in charge of the England team. When he first got his feet under the desk, England played a 4-2-3-1 formation with a No 10 \u2013 Wayne Rooney or Dele Alli at the time \u2013 expected to knit everything together in the style of the player England have never had since Paul Gascoigne (and never used in that way when he was around). Just before the World Cup that system changed, to the famous and multi-hyphenated 3-1-2-2-2, which shored things up at the back a bit and asked two advanced midfielders \u2013 Alli again and Jesse Lingard \u2013 to facilitate the speedy transition of the ball (or alternatively themselves) to the final third.\n\nSince those heady Luzhniki nights, England have transformed once more. The shape is now a more familiar 4-3-3 with pace to burn on the wings and a balance of abilities in midfield. The landmark victory in this formation, the 3-2 win in Spain, saw a midfield three of Eric Dier as enforcer, Harry Winks as the passing metronome and Ross Barkley as the man with licence to progress with the ball at his feet.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nEngland look likely to continue with 4-3-3 this season and into the Euros. There might well be a change in how it is played, however. The win in Seville, as thrilling as it was, saw England register only 27% of possession. There was a similar pattern against the Netherlands in the summer after Marcus Rashford\u2019s opening goal. Between that penalty and Walker\u2019s own goal in extra time, their opponents had nigh-on two-thirds of the ball.\n\nPossession may not be nine-tenths of the law in football, and England \u2013 thanks to the pace and skill of players such as Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho \u2013 are and will continue to be a powerful threat on the counterattack. But if this team are to keep evolving \u2013 and we have established that it must \u2013 then they need to up it in terms of possession and go toe to toe against even the toughest opponents.\n\nThat is where Mount and, in particular, Maddison come in. Southgate explained the absence of the Leicester man from his squad earlier this year as being because \u201cI think he\u2019s a No 10 and, at the moment, we\u2019ve not been playing with a 10\u201d. Asked last week about this, however, and Southgate had changed his mind.\n\nMason Mount ready for England challenge after early Chelsea success | David Hytner Read more\n\n\u201cHe played as an eight in the summer for us\u201d, Southgate said of Maddison\u2019s not entirely successful under-21s campaign. \u201cMason can definitely play as an eight and equally off the wing as well. They\u2019re [both] players of high technical ability who are going to threaten the goal.\u201d\n\nAlongside Phil Foden, Maddison and Mount make up a trio of players who have the skills of that mythical No 10, but are likely to be deployed in a more responsible way as a No 8 in a midfield three. They can hurt the opposition with passes, they are effective shooters from range, they have the ability to carry the ball, but perhaps most importantly they know \u2013 or will be expected to know \u2013 how to hold on to it. This would appear to be the next evolution of England.\n\nConstant revolution has not arrived on the shores of the UK \u2013 not yet anyway \u2013 and constant evolution may also prove tricky. Southgate has set himself a high bar thanks to England\u2019s exploits in Russia and he knows well enough that expectations at home will clear that mark next summer. Playing the youngsters will not provide any cover. England have a year to bed in new players and advance their style before a competition in which reaching the semi-finals would be par.
