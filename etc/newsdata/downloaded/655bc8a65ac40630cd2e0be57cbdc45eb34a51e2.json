Followed by vote on the programme motion.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nWhat Labour voters in Don Valley think of their local MP Caroline Flint and her decision to back Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal", "description": "Boris Johnson's Brexit Bill has major consequences for the UK and our future prosperity.
