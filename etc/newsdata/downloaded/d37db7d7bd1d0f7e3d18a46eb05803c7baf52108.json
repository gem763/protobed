While the Alberta Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled the original trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury.\n\nBack then, the official cause of death was bacterial meningitis.\n\nHowever, in his written decision, Clackson wrote that he accepted the opinion of Alberta's former chief medical officer, Dr. Anny Sauvageau, who told court she does not believe Ezekiel actually died from bacterial meningitis.\n\n\"In this case, we know there is no specific treatment that is effective for viral meningitis,\" Clackson wrote.\n\n\"It follows that the Crown did not prove medical attention would have saved [Ezekiel's] life or that if he had viral meningitis and it was life-threatening [which is not established in the evidence], medical attention even could have saved his life.\"\n\nIn a written statement, the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service said it has not yet decided whether to appeal Clackson's decision.\n\n\"We respect the decision of the Court,\" reads the statement. \"This has been a challenging case for everyone involved. The Alberta Crown Prosecution Service will review the decision to determine next steps.\"\n\nTreated with natural remedies\n\nOver the course of the trial, the Stephans testified that they initially thought Ezekiel had croup, an upper airway infection, and they treated him with natural remedies including a smoothie with garlic, onion and horseradish.\n\nThey said he appeared to be recovering at times, and they saw no reason to take him to hospital, despite his having a fever and lacking energy.\n\nThe Stephans leave the Lethbridge courthouse in 2016 after being found guilty in their first trial of failing to provide the necessaries of life in the death to Ezekiel. (David Rossiter/The Canadian Press)\n\nThey called an ambulance when the boy stopped breathing.\n\nDavid Stephan, who was representing himself, said in his final arguments that it was paramedics who caused Ezekiel's death by improperly intubating the boy.\n\nSauvageau also suggested Ezekiel might have lived had the first ambulance to Cardston, Alta., been better equipped to treat a child his age with breathing difficulties.\n\nBut Clackson heard evidence the parents knew the boy had meningitis and were told days before he stopped breathing to take Ezekiel to a hospital or doctor.\n\n\"It's the Stephans' failure to respond to \u2026 increasingly alarming information or feedback from their child during that period of time,\" Crown prosecutor Britta Kristensen said in her closing argument.\n\n\"Both parents knew the child had meningitis.\"", "description": "David and Collet Stephan, an Alberta couple who treated their son's illness with natural remedies rather than taking him to a doctor,\u00a0have been found not guilty in the toddler's death after a retrial.", "authors": ["Cbc Calgary Reporter", "Meghan Grant Is The Courts", "Crime Reporter For Cbc Calgary.", "Follow Her On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5290522.1568930461!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/david-and-collet-stephan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
