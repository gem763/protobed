In the other locker room, Coach Kyle Shanahan announced he would give a game ball to his father, Mike, whom Snyder fired in 2013 after a tenure in which the two men frequently clashed. Washington had hung with the undefeated 49ers, but never seriously threatened an upset. As hearty fans trudged mercifully for exits, the Redskins couldn\u2019t even muster anger at the 49ers\u2019 celebration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWinning cures everything,\u201d guard Ereck Flowers said. \u201cIf we\u2019d have won the game, there wouldn\u2019t be no sliding.\u201d\n\nIt was another bleak Sunday in a long string of bleakness. The shutout offered more evidence \u2014 needless, at this point \u2014 that Washington\u2019s season is lost, and that the remaining 10 weeks matter only in how they can enhance Washington\u2019s future prospects.\n\nThat\u2019s a dicey topic of discussion to begin with, because the only consistent thing about Snyder\u2019s 20 years, particularly during the last 10 with Bruce Allen as a top executive, has been the snuffing out of any signs of promise. But if you\u2019re a fan of the franchise and haven\u2019t given up hope yet, the only point of this season is the future. Washington has not acted as if it realizes that fact, and it needs to.\n\nAD\n\nWhether Jay Gruden was at fault or blameless for the ruinous beginning of Washington\u2019s season, his firing two weeks ago should have resolved a central problem to this Redskins season. They had a lame-duck coach with no incentive to develop players or plan for the future. The best course of action for today was inherently at odds with the best course of action for tomorrow. That was untenable to begin with because of the presence of first-round quarterback Dwayne Haskins, and it grew even more untenable when losses mounted and their season spiraled before October.\n\nAD\n\nWithout the man in charge coaching for his job, Washington had a chance to reset its priorities. Under interim Bill Callahan, all indications are they have not. Callahan\u2019s outlook, and his first two games, have suggested the coach has changed, but the core present-vs.-future problem remains.\n\nIn his opening news conference, Callahan declared himself a devotee of the running game who would work tirelessly with the sole aim of winning games, and his actions have validated those promises. Nobody could blame Callahan for doing his job that way, but they run counter to what Washington needs now, and if he doesn\u2019t amend his approach, his bosses ought to do it for him.\n\nAD\n\nWashington threw only 11 passes Sunday as veteran journeyman Case Keenum took every snap. They ran the ball on their first 10 snaps, leaning heavily on Hall of Fame-bound veteran Adrian Peterson. They added a fullback, Michael Burton, to the roster this week and used him frequently as an effective lead blocker.\n\nAD\n\nWhat does that accomplish? What is the point of lining up Peterson in the I formation and pounding the rock while Keenum flails and Haskins watches?\n\nWith the caveat that a victory Sunday would have placed them only two games out of first place in the underwhelming NFC East, Washington\u2019s season is dead. They can use these games to find and develop players who could be useful in coming years. On this roster, that means promising young receivers and Haskins. It means giving offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell, viewed internally as an up-and-comer, a chance to call plays unencumbered by offensive thinking out of step with basic modern tenets.\n\nAD\n\nTo be fair, Sunday presented Callahan with challenging conditions. Playing Haskins against San Francisco\u2019s fearsome pass rush in the slop would have amounted to sabotage. The cold rain and wind forced Callahan to run even more than he wanted to.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe conditions played into the decision to run the ball a little bit more and be more controlled in the pass and limit the pass attempts,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThat was more for field conditions and weather conditions. We wanted some more attempts.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s fair. The problem is, Callahan does not seem intent on playing Haskins. Callahan gave Haskins more practice reps in his first week, and this week, with Keenum nursing a foot injury, Haskins took the majority of first-team snaps. That is a good first step. But it would be a mistake not to give Haskins game experience and learn more about what exactly they have in him. Callahan seems to be leaning toward making that mistake.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDwayne\u2019s still learning,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI think he\u2019d be the first one to tell you that. We still have faith in Case and his ability to manage this offense and run this offense. We\u2019re moving forward with Case at this juncture.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn discussing Haskins, Callahan struck the same notes as Gruden. It\u2019s past time to let Haskins prove, on the field, whether he is ready or not. Maybe it would be irresponsible to give Haskins his first start Thursday night on the road, after a short and against Kirk Cousins, the quarterback Washington let walk in free agency and somebody natural to measure Haskins against. Fine. Washington\u2019s next game is at Buffalo nine days later. Callahan should use those extra days to focus on preparing Haskins to make his first NFL start.\n\nSo far, Callahan\u2019s tenure feels a lot like Gruden\u2019s tenure. Washington barely beat Miami, the worst team the NFL has seen in recent memory. Sunday, it scored no points in dismal conditions. He has a fullback and he gives the ball to Peterson a lot. As far as the direction of the franchise, nothing has changed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe works us harder during the week,\u201d wide receiver Steven Sims said. \u201cThat\u2019s about it. We just practice a little harder, a little longer.\u201d\n\nMore change is needed. Washington is 1-6 with the least-impressive victory conceivable. If this franchise has any chance to reverse its two-decade course, there\u2019s no need to waste time focused on the present. If the Redskins don\u2019t change how they approach the rest of the season, it will ensure only one outcome: The slide is only going to continue.\n\nAD", "description": "In an increasingly lost season, Washington is wasting time by not catering to its future \u2014 beginning at quarterback.", "authors": ["Adam Kilgore", "Reporter Covering National Sports"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UOaxc5wg_wPOoL535lmQBpbUBb8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VAWI7SXTOQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
