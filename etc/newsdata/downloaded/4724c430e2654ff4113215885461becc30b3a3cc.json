Cory A. Booker on Thursday released a plan intended to bolster the rights of college athletes and move toward pay and gender equity in sports, including to the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team.\n\nUnder Mr. Booker\u2019s plan, college athletes could get paid for \u201cname, image, and likeness\u201d rights, a priority modeled on legislation that recently passed in California.\n\n\u201cSports at these levels is a multibillion-dollar business,\u201d said Mr. Booker, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former college football player. \u201cJust as we shouldn\u2019t accept collusion, wage theft, and a massive gender pay gap in any other industry, we shouldn\u2019t accept them in sports.\u201d\n\nMr. Booker also wants to establish a new federal commission on \u201cIntegrity in Sports\u201d that would provide additional oversight over college athletics and the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee.\n\nThe commission would be charged with making recommendations on issues like whether athletes should be able to form unions, health and safety standards, and access to health care.\n\nMr. Booker also wants to bolster health and safety standards for college athletes, help current and former college athletes pay their medical bills, and make it easier for athletes to transfer schools.\n\nThe plan also includes legislation to require national governing bodies, including the United States Soccer Federation, to compensate female athletes \u201cfairly and equally.\u201d\n\nHe also wants to improve pay for minor league baseball players, end \u201cexploitative\u201d labor policies for NFL cheerleaders and NBA dancers, and crack down on \u201canti-competitive\u201d labor practices, invoking former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s effective exile from the league as an example.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
