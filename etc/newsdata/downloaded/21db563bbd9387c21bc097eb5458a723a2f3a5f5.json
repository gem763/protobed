Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee responsible for funding DOE. \u201cI believe Secretary Perry to be a patriot. I have no idea what he\u2019s caught in, if he\u2019s caught up in anything.\u201d\n\nKaptur said she sent a text message this morning to House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) asking him to demand testimony from the secretary. She said Schiff had not responded as of midday Friday. A spokesperson for the Intelligence Committee declined comment on whether it would seek Perry's testimony.\n\nPerry said in a Friday interview on Fox News he\u2019ll defer to Energy Department counsel on whether to respond to the subpoena from the Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Relations committees. Congressional investigators have asked him to produce documents related to his trips to the country and his interactions with other figures in the probe, including Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a senior member of the Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, said Congress will not let up in its efforts to obtain testimony and records from Perry amid his resignation.\n\n\u201cIt would appear that he played a more prominent role than we had thought heretofore,\u201d Connolly told reporters. \u201cThe role he played is the role he played. Whatever his current status is immaterial.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans downplayed any potential damage to Perry\u2019s reputation, even as they indicated he should not participate in the process.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Rick Perry\u2019s legacy at all,\u201d Rep. Pete Olson (R-Texas) said in an interview Wednesday, prior to Perry\u2019s announcement that he would resign. \u201cHe should do what\u2019s best for Rick Perry and the country. I trust Rick. If he wants to testify, he\u2019ll do that. If he doesn\u2019t, he won\u2019t. My guess is he won\u2019t want to be involved in a witch hunt \u2014 he\u2019s seen that before.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ac/f0/1fdee6e8454b93f6bb55fa9d5c11/191018-rick-perry-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
