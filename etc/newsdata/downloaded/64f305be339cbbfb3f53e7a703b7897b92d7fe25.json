The estate spans roughly 34,775 square feet, according to Zillow, which lists the home as off the market.\n\nSchonfeld would be privy to the 350 feet of oceanfront and around 230 feet of frontage along the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nImage 1 of 3\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe home is owned by beauty mogul Sydell Miller who cofounded Matrix Essentials Inc., a hair and beauty line, the Post reported.\n\nSchonfeld, who has been managing hedge fund investments since 1998, is the CEO and founder of Schonfeld Group Holdings LLC which provides investment management and advisory services through its subsidiaries to clients in the United States.\n\nIf and when the deal closes, it will obliterate Palm Beach\u2019s previous record when Broadway producer Terry Allen Kramer's estate sold for $105 million, which also sits on South Ocean Boulevard, according to the Post.\n\nWhile the deal would make it the most expensive detached house ever sold, according to the post, it is still a far cry away from the roughly $238 million price billionaire Ken Griffin paid for his New York penthouse this year. This set the record for the highest-priced home ever sold in the U.S. according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Hedge funder\u00a0Steven Schonfeld is about to close a deal that will land him the most expensive mansion in U.S. history, according to a report.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/florida-listing-002.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
