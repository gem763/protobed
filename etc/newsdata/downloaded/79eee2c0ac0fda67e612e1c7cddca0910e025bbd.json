In 1960, their tax rate was as high as 56 percent. The effective tax rate paid by the bottom 50 percent, by contrast, has changed little over time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe analysis differs from many other published estimates of tax burdens by encompassing the totality of taxes Americans pay: not just federal income taxes but also corporate taxes, as well as taxes paid at the state and local levels. It also includes the burden of about $250 billion of what Saez and Zucman call \u201cindirect taxes,\u201d such as licenses for motor vehicles and businesses.\n\nThe analysis, which was the subject of a column in the New York Times on Monday, is also notable for the detailed breakdown of the tax burden of not just the top 1 percent but also the top 0.1 percent, the top 0.01 percent and the 400 richest households.\n\nThe focus on the ultrarich is necessary, Saez and Zucman write, because those households control a disproportionate share of national wealth: The top 400 families have more wealth than the bottom 60 percent of households, while the top 0.1 percent own as much as the bottom 80 percent. The top 400 families are a \u201cnatural reference point,\u201d Zucman says, because the IRS publishes information on the top 400 taxpayers as a group, and other sources, such as Forbes, track the fortunes of the 400 wealthiest Americans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the tipping point came in 2017, with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That bill, championed by President Trump and then-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, was a windfall for the wealthy: It lowered the top income tax bracket and slashed the corporate tax rate.\n\nBy 2018, according to Saez and Zucman, the rich were already enjoying the fruits of that legislation: The average effective tax rate paid by the top 0.1 percent of households dropped by 2.5 percentage points. The benefits the bill\u2019s supporters promised \u2014 higher rates of growth and business investment and a shrinking deficit \u2014 have largely failed to materialize.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNot all economists accept Saez and Zucman\u2019s analysis. It is based in part on their previous work, along with French economist Thomas Piketty, on the distribution of wealth and income in American society. Other economists have generated estimates of that distribution that show smaller disparities between the country\u2019s haves and have-nots. Saez, Zucman and Piketty have defended their research and maintain that their methods are the most accurate.\n\nOn the question of tax burdens, Jason Furman, an economics professor at Harvard who chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, noted that Saez and Zucman did not include refundable tax credits, such as the earned-income tax credit (EITC), in their analysis.\n\nThe credit, which is intended to encourage low-income families to work, \u201cis part of the tax code,\u201d Furman said. A person who paid $1,000 in federal income taxes and then received a $1,500 credit would have a total federal tax burden of -$500, but Furman said that under Saez and Zucman\u2019s analysis, that person would instead show a burden of $0. That result would make total tax burdens at the lower end of the income spectrum appear higher than they are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe best estimates indicate that the tax system is progressive \u2014 with the rich paying a higher tax rate than everyone else,\u201d Furman said.\n\nZucman countered that his and Saez\u2019s analysis considers the EITC and other credits like it as transfers of income, akin to food stamps or jobless benefits, rather than tax provisions.\n\n\u201cIf you start counting some transfers as negative taxes, it is not clear where to stop,\u201d he said via email. \u201cDo you treat the EITC as a negative tax? veterans\u2019 benefits? medicaid? defense spending?... There\u2019s no clear line and the results become arbitrary.\u201d\n\nThere is general agreement among economists, however, that the tax burden of the rich has fallen considerably in recent decades.\n\n\u201cThe rich definitely pay less in taxes than they did in the past and less than they should,\u201d Furman said.\n\nThe bulk of Saez and Zucman\u2019s new book explores how that happened, and how the trend might be reversed.\n\nAD", "description": "The analysis sets the stage for a new book by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman on tax avoidance among the rich.", "authors": ["Christopher Ingraham", "Reporter Covering All Things Data"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D51tAbW5lLuyTPsQLRINsmeM9uY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LAECU3AUW5AYHJOEZW3ROIFN4A.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
