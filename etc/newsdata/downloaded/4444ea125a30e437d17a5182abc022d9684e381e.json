My period came early, and I only realized I was bleeding when I felt the blood running down the side of my leg, threateningly close to reaching the floor beneath me. I ran to the bathroom: There were no sanitary products (paid, or free). None. I ran to the next bathroom: no sanitary products. All I could do was stuff some loo paper in my underwear to try and soak up the blood and run to the nearest pharmacy to buy tampons. It took me 30 minutes to get a tampon. It may not sound like long, but it felt like it: Adrenaline rushing, my body trembling, my mind wondering when I would start leaving a trail of blood on the floor behind me. I felt so much shame \u2014 and all because I am a woman with her period, and bathrooms are not properly equipped for us.\u201d", "description": "Eight stories of periods, pumping and piercing pain", "authors": ["Caroline Kitchener", "Caroline Kitchener Is A Staff Writer At The Lily.
