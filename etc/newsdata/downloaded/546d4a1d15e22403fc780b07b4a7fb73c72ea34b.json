To start off with the literal hats: we have pillbox, we have Fez, we have Gatsby. Then, we have Midge\u2019s considerable talents: her wit, her pluck, and, of course, her comedy, all of which she uses on tour with Shy Baldwin, played by Leroy McClain. The trailer also features glimpses of new guest stars played by the likes of Sterling K. Brown and Amy Sherman-Palladino show veteran Liza Weil, who tells Midge from behind a pair of cat-eye glasses that she\u2019s not \u201chaving to go to [her] grave not having done anything interesting.\u201d The trailer wraps up by reminding us just how many Emmys this show has won (the answer: a whole lot). Season three of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel premieres on December 6 on Amazon Prime.", "description": "Trailer for \u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Season 3 [VIDEO] includes Rachel Brosnahan, Jane Lynch, Tony Shalhoub, and Sterling K.
