The U.S. Marshals Service said Blane and Susan Barksdale were back in custody, but gave no other details.\n\nCBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV, citing Marshals Service sources, reports the Barksdales were found in Tonto Basin, northeast of Phoenix. The Navajo County Sheriff's Office said in a Facebook post that it helped in the arrest.\n\nBlane, 56, and Susan, 59, escaped in Utah while being extradited back to Tucson from New York on Aug. 26.\n\nBlane and Susan Barksdale after being recaptured on September 11, 2019 Navajo County Sheriff's Office / KPHO-TV\n\nThe Marshals Service said Susan Barksdale faked a medical emergency while riding in the van near Blanding, Utah. The couple overpowered two guards, tied them up and put them in the back of the van with a third prisoner, who wasn't involved.\n\nThe couple drove to Vernon, Arizona, where they got a Red GMC Sierra pickup truck from an acquaintance, leaving the van with the guards and other inmate locked inside, the Marshals Service said.\n\nTucson authorities said the Barksdales might have been getting help to stay in hiding. They don't think the couple made it to Mexico, KOLD says.\n\nThey were being extradited from upstate New York, where they were arrested in May.\n\nThe Marshals Service was offering rewards of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest of Blane and $10,000 for Susan. The service added Blane to its 15 Most Wanted list earlier this week. There was no initial word on whether any of the reward money would be handed out.\n\nThe Barksdales have been charged with first-degree murder by Tucson police in the death of Frank Bligh, 72, who hasn't been seen since fire consumed his home April 16. Evidence found there led detectives to conclude the blaze was set.\n\nDetectives said it appeared more than 100 firearms were stolen from the home. Only around 30 have been recovered.\n\nThe charges against the Barksdales before they got away included first-degree murder, first-degree burglary, arson of an occupied structure, criminal damage and auto theft.\n\nThe Barksdales were being extradited from upstate New York, where they were arrested in May.", "description": "Blane and Susan Barksdale escaped from a prison van in Utah late last month while being extradited from New York state back to Arizona", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/94a83cef-0416-4cdc-91bb-2622adeda964/thumbnail/1200x630/59b63cc51361aec1399d201bfff6758f/blane-barksdale-susan-barksdale.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
