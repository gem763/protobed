Von der Leyen\u2019s Green Deal was doomed from the start.\n\nThe European Commission, which originates EU policy, splits and chops proposals and distributes them among siloed teams of experts, who then draft the legislation. Social policy is divorced from trade policy, just like finance is divorced from greenhouse gas reduction targets. In the best case, ambitious proposals end up in the hands of officials who are sympathetic to the cause. In the worst, they reside with commissioners who are determined to see them fail.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s structural and political constraints are likely to produce a set of watered-down, piecemeal solutions.\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s Green Deal is a case in point. Though she tapped the center-left Dutch politician Frans Timmermans as her commissioner for a \"European Green Deal,\u201d she handed the \u201cEconomy that Works for People\u201d portfolio to Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister and the chief architect of the country\u2019s austerity program. There's little reason to believe the center-right politician will be eager to embrace the environmental ambition needed to see the Green Deal through.\n\nAt the commissioner hearings last week, Timmermans downplayed the split. \u201cYou can't go it alone; you can't achieve all this alone. Under Ursula von der Leyen's leadership, we will work together,\u201d he said. But sources close to him suggest that he was riled by the decision \u2014 not just because it neutered core aspects of his portfolio, but also because it signified a major power shift within the Commission.\n\nVon der Leyen\u2019s mission letters to Timmermans and Dombrovskis are revealing: While the Dutchman is in charge of soft issues like a new 2030 emission reduction target, zero-pollution ambition and the circular economy, Dombrovskis\u2019 portfolio includes most of the hard, financing-related aspects of the green transition.\n\nDombrovskis is tasked with transforming the European Investment Bank into a climate bank. He will oversee a new financing strategy based on the issuance of green bonds. And he will coordinate the work on von der Leyen\u2019s Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which promises to \u201cunlock\u201d \u20ac1 trillion of investments over the next decade. The bread and butter of the Green Deal, then, will need to pass by Dombrovskis\u2019 desk before it sees the light of day.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the next Commission\u2019s political structure. Timmermans coordinates the work of five directorates general (DGs), but most of these are led by center-right commissioners. At the same time, Dombrovskis heads no fewer than four DGs, most of them led by center-left figures.\n\nIn other words, von der Leyen ensured a political balance between the center left and the center right, while reinforcing the latter\u2019s supervision of portfolios essential for realizing the Green Deal. Jobs, cohesion, reforms and, crucially, economy \u2014 these all fall within Dombrovskis\u2019 remit, not Timmermans\u2019.\n\nSources suggest that von der Leyen\u2019s last-minute move to promote Dombrovskis was an attempt to seize control of the Green Deal for the center right, while ensuring that the responsibility for its success or failure remains with Timmermans, the public face of the Commission\u2019s environmental ambitions.\n\nTimmermans\u2019 S&D allies in the Parliament are already voicing concerns. \u201cWe require clarification on how exactly you foresee Mr. Dombrovskis' collaboration with other relevant commissioners in order to deliver on the ambitious and progressive cross-sectorial set of policies you have entrusted him with, including within the scope of the Green New Deal,\u201d S&D group leader Iratxe Garcia-Perez wrote in a letter to von der Leyen.\n\nUrgency is mounting. Even if the Commission could realize its current plans for a Green Deal, it would still be only the first step of the many that will be needed to tackle Europe\u2019s twin crises of austerity, and climate and environmental breakdown.\n\nThe record doesn\u2019t bode well. The Commission\u2019s structural and political constraints are likely to produce a set of watered-down, piecemeal solutions. Meanwhile, the clock on climate and environmental breakdown keeps ticking away.\n\nPawel Wargan and David Adler are the coordinators of the Green New Deal for Europe and members of the Democracy in Europe Movement (DiEM25) governing board.", "description": "The Commission\u2019s political constraints will ensure it gets watered down.", "authors": ["David Adler", "Pawel Wargan", "David M.
