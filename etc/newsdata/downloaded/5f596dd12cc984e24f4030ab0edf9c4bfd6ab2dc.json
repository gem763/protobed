I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest political developments this morning until Andrew Sparrow is ready to take charge.\n\nMPs met until the early hours on an another dramatic night in Westminster as parliament was suspended for five weeks at the request of Boris Johnson. The consternation of many MPs and the Speaker of the House, John Bercow, was clear, with the outgoing speaker describing the prorogation as \u201cnot typical\u201d, \u201cnot standard\u201d and as representing \u201can act of executive fiat\u201d.\n\nThere were chaotic scenes in the house as Bercow began proceedings to prorogue parliament, as a group of opposition MPs carrying signs reading \u201csilenced\u201d drowned out Black Rod as she tried to address the Speaker, the ritual that initiates the suspension.\n\nMPs stage a protest in the House of Commons before prorogation of Parliament.

Photograph: Parliament TV/PA\n\nSeveral MPs were also involved in altercation near the Speaker\u2019s chair, as they attempted to prevent him leaving his seat and attending the House of Lords, the next step in the formalities required for the suspension of parliament.\n\nCries of \u201cshame on you\u201d rose from the opposition benches as government MPs left the chamber. Labour MPs, who remained in their seats after government MPs and the Speaker had left to attend the House of Lords, sang Jerusalem and Bread of Heaven.\n\nParliament won\u2019t sit today, or for the next five weeks, but we\u2019re anticipating a lot of furious reaction. Join us as we bring you that and all of the day\u2019s other news.\n\nTweet me at @pgreenfielduk if you have any questions.", "description": "MPs from both sides expressed fury at prorogation proceedings in early hours of Tuesday morning", "authors": ["Patrick Greenfield", "Andrew Sparrow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d0b658162ca972e1568e255c70f37c8d534e20/0_15_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c098f25f6b3ca82add6365693ce144be", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
