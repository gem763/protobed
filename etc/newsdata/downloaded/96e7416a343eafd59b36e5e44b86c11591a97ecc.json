A Discovery representative confirmed the talks.\n\nThe alliance, which doesn\u2019t have a name yet, will sell ads as an independent body, the companies said. Participating publishers will share ad revenue based on the amount of ads they deliver.\n\nYouTube is the dominant seller of digital video advertising. Alphabet Inc. does not break out YouTube\u2019s financials, but analysts have estimated that the video giant brings in more than $15 billion in annual ad revenue.\n\nOther tech giants including Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Snap Inc. are also becoming bigger players in the business.\n\nBut marketers have repeatedly bumped up against offensive, highly charged or otherwise unwanted content on YouTube. Early this year, for example, marketers including Nestl\u00e9 SA and McDonald\u2019s Corp. suspended advertising on YouTube after a report highlighted inappropriate user comments appearing under videos featuring underage girls.\n\n\u201cWe continue to hear from clients that they\u2019re looking for a more brand-safe environment, but still needed the scale they get on the platforms,\u201d said Christa Carone, president of Group Nine Media, whose brands include NowThis, Thrillist and the Dodo.\n\nThe companies said they expect the alliance to help them land larger ad deals. \u201cFor all of us to get together in a room like this, we\u2019re not going to do a deal that we could have normally gotten on our own,\u201d said Ken Blom, senior vice president of ad strategy and partnerships for BuzzFeed.\n\nPublisher ad alliances aren\u2019t new, though the strength of Google, Facebook and, increasingly, Amazon in online ad sales is making the case more compelling for some.\n\nIn the U.K., the Guardian, the Telegraph and News U.K. banded together last year to form the Ozone Project, which sells ad space across their sites. News U.K. and The Wall Street Journal share a common owner.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why media companies are merging,\u201d said Catherine Sullivan, chief investment officer at Omnicom Media Group North America. \u201cEveryone is trying to compete with platforms; this helps, even though they are not going to be as big as the platforms.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed, Group Nine and Insider say they have nearly 100 million subscribers across their YouTube networks and are generating more than 1 billion video views across their own sites and apps every month.\n\nAdvertising executives said they don\u2019t expect this alliance to pull marketers\u2019 ad budgets away from YouTube, but they like the idea of simplifying buying across publishers.\n\nSome advertisers also said the publishers will need to offer something beyond mass reach and brand-safe environments. \u201cThere has to be something more proprietary of them coming together\u2014what else are they offering that\u2019s unique?\u201d said Christine Peterson, managing director and digital investment lead at Mindshare USA, part of WPP PLC.\n\nThe brand safety pitch is compelling, but there are caveats there, too. \u201cThere are trusted news sources some brands don\u2019t want to be aligned with because of politics,\u201d Ms. Peterson said.\n\nThe publisher alliance also comes as digital media companies are more vocally exploring the notion of merging to better position themselves against tech competitors. BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti publicly floated the idea in a New York Times interview last year, tossing out names of potential partners including Vice Media LLC, Vox Media Inc., Refinery29 Inc. and Group Nine.\n\nVice has had talks to buy Refinery29, people familiar with the matter said in July.\n\nThe video ad-sales alliance is not a precursor to a merger, said Ms. Carone. \u201cThere is no discussion right now on a merger or an acquisition.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "Three prominent digital publishers are pooling their video ad space in an effort to better compete against Alphabet Inc.-owned YouTube, other digital platforms and TV networks.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109954/social", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
