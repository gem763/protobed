REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nThe BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee also said Britain\u2019s banks and the rest of its financial system were fully prepared for a worst-case Brexit although there could be disruption, particularly for borrowers in the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe terms of engagement for innovations such as Libra must be adopted in advance of any launch,\u201d the FPC said in a statement. \u201cUK authorities should use their powers accordingly.\u201d\n\nThe principles include a requirement for the entire payment chain to show its operational and financial resilience, and provide enough information for regulators monitor payments.\n\n\u201cLibra has the potential to become a systemically important payment system,\u201d the BoE\u2019s Financial Policy Committee said.\n\nSo-called wallets for crypto-payments are akin to bank accounts that are subject to a welter of rules, such as deposit insurance, liquidity and capital requirements.\n\nThe European Union on Tuesday said it will propose a new law to cover crypto-asset projects like Libra, saying they posed a risk to the wider financial system.\n\nUnlike the EU, the Bank of England\u2019s FPC said that for now, it will apply its principles by applying existing supervisory \u201ctools\u201d, rather than resorting to new rules.\n\nThe FPC also said it will set out in December changes it would like to see in so-called open ended funds following a review by the Bank and the Financial Conduct Authority.\n\nHigh-profile fund manager Neil Woodford had to suspend his flagship fund in June, trapping thousands of investors. The fund offered daily redemptions to customers but it ran out of cash because some of the assets could not be quickly sold.\n\nBritain, however, may not be able to introduce all the fund rule changes itself as some will need backing from international regulators.\n\nIn its statement on Wednesday, the FPC signaled a possible crack down on banks that are slow to stop using the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, as a price reference in financial contracts.\n\nBanks have been fined billions of dollars for trying to rig Libor and the FPC wants lenders to shift to using Sonia, an overnight sterling-denominated interest rate benchmark compiled by the central bank.\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for firms continuing to increase their exposure to Libor,\u201d the FPC said.\n\nThe risk watchdog said it will consider further \u201cpotential policy and supervisory tools\u201d during the fourth quarter to reduce the stock of legacy Libor contracts.\n\nSterling Libor is set to be phased out by the end of 2021.", "description": "The Bank of England set out the rules of engagement that Facebook's Libra crypto-currency and other new digital payments providers would have to meet before they can open for business in Britain.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438759784&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980LV", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
