Armed robbery, you fool.'\n\nMet Police detectives had spent a week tracking down career criminal Adam Yaroo, 32, and after identifying his hideout sent armed officers to lay in wait for a pre-dawn raid on May 2. He is seen here being arrested\n\nThe footage, from new BBC documentary, The Met: Policing London, began with police having to temporarily stand down the raid after Yaroo left his home at 2am in the morning of May 2.\n\nRather than giving up though the team decided to wait, with armed officers from the Met's Trojan unit leading the raid.\n\nSpotting a man speeding past in a moped, the detectives alerted their colleagues, who caught Yaroo on his doorstep.\n\nThe thug tried to deny robbing Mr Jordan, telling an officer: 'I don't understand what you lot are talking about, I've already heard of all this s*** coming towards me, people saying it was something to do with me, it was nothing to do with me, I make money in other ways so don't try and spring me with that bull****.'\n\nBut inside his house officers found a trove of incriminating evidence, including the Nike hoodie and crash helmet he was wearing during the robbery, plus the fake Walther P99 pistol he threatened Mr Jordan with.\n\nA stash of jewellery, a bundle of notes worth up to \u00a32,000 and two stolen mopeds were also recovered.\n\nYaroo was eventually jailed for six years for the robbery, which happened in Croydon, south London, on March 21.\n\nMr Jordan had just picked up his 80-year-old father from hospital in his Maserati sports car when the robber struck.\n\nFootage of the heist showed Yaroo pull up alongside Mr Jordan on a motorbike on a busy road and threaten him with a gun, before driving away with his ultra-rare Franck Muller wristwatch.\n\nYaroo (pictured) was armed with a fake Walther P99 pistol when he snatched the \u00a3135,000 watch from Simon Jordan\n\nReading from Mr Jordan's victim impact statement, Judge David Miller said: 'He said although there was no physical injury there was psychological impact.\n\n'I now feel uneasy and nervous, almost paranoid. My 80-year-old father has suffered stress which hasn't helped his recovery.\n\n'He feels guilty because I was only in the area because I collected him in the hospital.'\n\nThe judge added: 'His 10-year-old daughter is very shocked at what happened to her father and grandfather because you pointed a gun at them in broad daylight.'\n\nYaroo was brought to the dock in handcuffs for sentencing at Woolwich Crown Court after saying he planned to stab cell officers.\n\nSentencing him for the robbery and six burglaries plus driving and weapon offences, Judge Miller said: 'It's set against a background of you having spent a good part of your life burgling houses.\n\n'You are what can only be described as a career criminal, or as your barrister puts it a career burglar.\n\n'You started appearing in courts when you were quite young: in 1999 before the Youth Court and you have continued to appear almost every year since then.\n\n'You on March 21, on a motorbike with false number plates in a busy shopping road, followed a car which was being driven by Simon Jordan and caught up to the car having followed it for a mile or so in quiet residential streets.\n\n'You approached his car, he was in fact driving his car with his 80-year-old father who he had just collected from hospital.\n\n'You pointed a gun at his face and demanded that he hand over his watch, a watch which happens to be worth \u00a3135,000.\n\n'You threatened that if he didn't hand it over you will shoot him and you did this in front of his 80-year-old father.\n\n\"I'll f**king shoot you, you c**t, give me the watch or I\u2019ll f**king shoot you\" is what you said to him.\n\n'You get away with that and ride off and within hours you were selling that watch in Hatton Garden.'\n\nThe team swamped Yaroo when he returned home on his moped and put him in a squad car with no resistance. He then ranted at police: 'Take me to your police station and take me to jail, d***head. Armed robbery, you fool'\n\nBut inside his house officers found a trove of incriminating evidence, including the Nike hoodie and crash helmet he was wearing during the robbery, plus the fake Walther P99 pistol he threatened Mr Jordan with (pictured)\n\nA stash of jewellery, (pictured) a bundle of notes worth up to \u00a32,000 and two stolen mopeds were also recovered\n\nFootage captured by a bus-mounted dash cam showed Yaroo speed off.\n\nThe judge said Yaroo later sent a WhatsApp message on his mobile phone showing an article in a national newspaper concerning the robbery, as if to 'boast of the robbery'.\n\nHe added that the robbery happened while Yaroo was on prison licence.\n\nThe court heard Yaroo's convictions for burgling homes started in 2003, where he received a detention and training order for attempted burglary.\n\nHe was jailed for five years for breaking into a home in 2004 and was jailed again for carrying out a similar raid shortly after being released in 2008.\n\nHe was jailed for two-and-a-half years in 2010 and three years in 2012 for other burglaries, and five years in 2014 for escaping lawful custody and burgling homes.\n\nSimon Smith, in mitigation, said: 'It's clear that Mr Jordan in his car had not planned to be in that area that day at all.\n\n'He just happened to be there at a time when the defendant on the motorbike was returning from a friend's house and the defendant says he saw Mr Jordan was wearing the watch which is very distinctive, diamond-encrusted, and is quite easy to pick up.\n\nThe court heard the thug could have sold the watch (shown) within hours in London's famous jewellery quarter, Hatton Garden\n\n'He was also wearing a diamond ring - at that point the defendant decided he was going to rob him.\n\n'The defendant is a career burglar and I don't seek to go behind in mitigating on his behalf. He accepts he will be sentenced as a professional or career burglar.'\n\nYaroo started to cry as he was sentenced to six years and four months for the robbery, and four years concurrent for possession of the imitation firearm.\n\nHe was jailed for a further six years and eight months for five burglaries and one aggravated burglary which took place between 2017 and 2018.\n\nConcurrently, he was jailed for one year of possession of a stun gun found at his home, four months for three counts of driving whilst disqualified and one year for stealing a car.\n\nHe will also serve a two-year driving ban on his release from prison and must \u00a3170 victim surcharge.\n\nAt an earlier hearing, Louise Oakley, prosecuting, said a victim impact statement from Mr Jordan said he purchased the 'rare piece' from a shop in Sloane Street, Chelsea.\n\nThe court heard in one of the burglaries, Yaroo used a moped to smash through the front door of a house in South Croydon which belonged to a Rolex employee.\n\nIn the raid, which lasted just 30 seconds, he took a \u00a315,000 Rolex Daytona, a yellow gold Rolex Day-Date worth \u00a326,000 and several other items of jewellery.\n\nAsked by the judge whether Yaroo knew the watches were inside, Miss Oakley said: 'He had a propensity to steal Rolex watches.\n\n'The fact that address was targeted with a real determined effort to get in and that he's inside the property for such a short period of time and has taken the items he has, the crown would submit is no coincidence.'\n\nBusinessman Mr Jordan is pictured wearing the \u00a3135,000 watch in a photo taken in 2007\n\nIn a daytime raid on another house, Yaroo made off with jewellery worth \u00a340,000 after he broke in when the owner left.\n\nHe took 'sentimental' items including wedding and engagement rings and cash.\n\nCops investigating that burglary found a knife which he dropped at the house and contained DNA which linked him to the crime.\n\nAn armed raid on Yaroo's home on May 2 uncovered the imitation gun used in the raid along with a stun gun disguised as a torch.\n\nThe court heard he has convictions for 62 offences and has previously asked for a total of 97 burglaries to be taken into consideration.\n\nHe was most recently jailed for five years in October 2014 for burglary, attempted burglary and escape from lawful custody.\n\nReferring to the robbery, Judge Miller said: 'This has the hallmarks of a professional, planned and targeted offence.'\n\nHe added: 'A watch which we know is worth \u00a3135,000 which is then sold, we think, or I am sure it's been sold within half an hour or so in Hatton Garden.'", "description": "Met Police detectives had spent a week tracking down career criminal Adam Yaroo, 32, and after identifying his hideout sent armed officers to lay in wait for a pre-dawn raid on May 2.", "authors": ["Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/09/19288144-0-image-a-5_1570176809398.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
