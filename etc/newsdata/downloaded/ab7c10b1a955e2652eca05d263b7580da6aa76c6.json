Over the past few weeks 30-year bonds yielded less than 2% interest. That inverted the yield curve as short-term rates were higher, including the rate on repurchase agreements and what the Federal Reserve pays on excess reserves.\n\nShould we blame the usual suspects\u2014a weakening global economy and trade wars? Not so fast. Sometimes it helps to look at things differently. \u201cThere\u2019s a dollar shortage,\u201d Jeffrey Snider of Alhambra Investments tells me. \u201cThe market knows what\u2019s going on and further knows the Fed doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFor more than a decade the Fed furiously expanded its balance sheet through quantitative easing, buying Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities and then paying interest on excess reserves to soak up all the extra money in the banking system. The Fed\u2019s assets increased from less than $1 trillion in September 2008 to almost $3.8 trillion today. Sadly, the stimulus hasn\u2019t stimulated very much. What went wrong? Maybe the shadow knows.\n\nShadow banking, that is. That\u2019s the market for repurchase agreements, or \u201crepos,\u201d a form of short-term borrowing. Mr. Snider calls it \u201ccollateralized interbank borrowing.\u201d One party puts up collateral such as a bond, and is paid for the value of that asset on the promise to buy it back later at a higher price. It can be overnight, 90 days or more. Often that collateral is lent out again, creating a money supply outside traditional fractional-reserve banking. It\u2019s huge\u2014today nonbank lenders hold more total assets than traditional banks do.\n\nBut shadow banking has issues. In times of stress, the repo market demands better or \u201cpristine\u201d collateral, usually longer-term U.S. debt, of which there often isn\u2019t enough. In 2013 I wrote about a shortage of collateral for the repo market and how Fed buying was squeezing the shadow banking system. Mr. Snider recalls the moment as well: \u201cThey were stripping the repo market of the best collateral as well as lesser-traded issues. They still had to buy up repo collateral to keep up the ruse that they were \u2018printing money\u2019 they weren\u2019t.\u201d The lack of inflation is proof that the total money supply has barely grown.\n\nThat shadow-banking crisis resolved as demand for pristine collateral eased, but today the collateral squeeze has returned at a much larger scale. Since the financial crisis, Mr. Snider notes several periods of stress and collateral shortages: European sovereign debt in 2011, emerging-market deflation in 2014 and China ending stimulus in the middle of last year\u2014all of which preceded President Trump\u2019s tariffs. Now the financial stress is coinciding with a decline in the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index, or may have even caused it. Add that Chinese banks like Bank of Jinzhou have hit a 10-year high in nonperforming loans\u2014mostly to state-owned industries\u2014that soak up central-bank dollars when written off.\n\n\u201cThe Fed is, as usual, clueless,\u201d Mr. Snider explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a dollar shortage across several different facets, including foreign exchange, which is not something the Fed can recognize especially since it involves the global dollar system rather than just certain domestic pieces of it.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. dollar is indeed global. China and others use dollars as reserves instead of gold. Dollars are involved in 87% of currency exchanges world-wide. Why? Because of what Korean economist Hyun Song Shin calls global value chains, in which companies need capital for short periods to hold inventory and fund receivables before selling up the supply chain. This is tricky especially across borders, since China\u2019s central bank needs to keep the yuan in line with the dollar. But when China expends dollars, it reduces its own money supply, since its reserves are in dollars. So China funds a lot of this borrowing through repos, derivatives and swaps, often in rolling 90-day periods, as Mr. Snider notes.\n\nShortages of long bonds\u2014good collateral\u2014are causing \u201crelentless\u201d demand and therefore lower yields. That\u2019s why German long bonds have negative interest rates: not because losing money is a great investment, but because negative interest is the cost of doing business to get \u201cpristine collateral\u201d to use in repos.\n\nThis is how the global credit system\u2014what Mr. Snider labels the Eurodollar market\u2014now works. The Fed has become the lender of last resort for the global market, including banks and shadow banks. It\u2019s about time its governors figure that out.\n\nSo what should they do? Encourage the Treasury to issue more of the long bonds the market is demanding: 30- or even 100-year. Feed the beast. Then stop quantitative easing: It doesn\u2019t work and soaks up collateral. Next, stop paying interest on reserves. Maybe even create a nontradable \u201cTreasury-R\u201d to act as reserve currency elsewhere, freeing up more bonds. If history repeats, there are about 90 days until China repos roll over again.\n\nThe Fed isn\u2019t likely to announce that it\u2019s the global backstop, and long yields will inch upward when the repo market returns to normal. But, eventually, easing the recurring shortage of collateral may provide real economic stimulus.\n\nWrite to kessler@wsj.com.", "description": "Its asset purchases are squeezing nonbank lending and sinking long-term bond rates.", "authors": ["Andy Kessler"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104849/social", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
