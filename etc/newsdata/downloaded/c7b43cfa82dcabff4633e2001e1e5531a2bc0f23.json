All the three major U.S. stock indexes initially extended earlier losses following the release of the Fed\u2019s policy statement on Wednesday, but and the Dow reversed losses to close a little high.\n\nI find that the prevailing weakness in looks evident enough to extend weakness in , as the steep fall in Bank Nifty since opening, looks evident enough to extend more bearishness in Bank Nifty. I find that if the Bank Nifty is not able to defend the level of 26,637; currently prevailing bearishness may be steeper than ever before. No doubt that some bouncing moves may be there amid this downward moves, but overall trend will remain bearish in Bank Nifty.\n\nFinally, I find that if the moves below 10,747, a reversal may be seen from the lower levels; but the overall trend looks bearish due to growing uncertainty at the global level.
