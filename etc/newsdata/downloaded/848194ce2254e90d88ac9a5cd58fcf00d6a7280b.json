REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nIn early Asian trades, MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS added 0.2% for its third straight day of gains to 518.29, the highest since late July.\n\nJapan's Nikkei .N225 was also upbeat, rising 0.3% to a decade high.\n\nThe gains came after a positive session in U.S. and European markets on Friday.\n\nU.S. and Chinese officials are \u201cclose to finalising\u201d some parts of a trade agreement after high-level telephone discussions on Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office and China\u2019s Commerce Ministry said, with talks to continue.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he hopes to sign the deal with China\u2019s President Xi Jinping next month at a summit in Chile.\n\nThe protracted trade war between the world\u2019s largest economies has hurt manufacturing activity, exports and business confidence globally while denting profits of many major industrial firms.\n\nOptimism that Beijing and Washington were finally close to resolving their dispute led the S&P500 .SPX to surpass its July 26 closing record of 3,025.86, though it ended a tad below that level on Friday. The S&P 500's total return index .SPXT posted an all-time high.\n\nE-mini futures for the S&P 500 ESc1 started firm on Monday, extending the positive momentum from last week.\n\nStrong results from companies including Intel (INTC.O) also boosted sentiment in equities market. More than 81% of U.S. companies have beaten Wall Street expectations so far this earnings season despite concerns about the trade war.\n\nInvestors next await earnings from the likes of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Facebook (FB.O) and Exxon (XOM.N).\n\nActivity later in the week will be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which markets expect is all but certain to lower interest rates at its Wednesday meeting.\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets on Thursday. On Friday, indicators for Chinese and U.S. manufacturing will be released.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of the FOMC policy meeting will most likely draw the largest market reaction,\u201d said Richard Grace, Sydney-based chief currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank.\n\n\u201cWe also think the risk is the FOMC will articulate a pause,\u201d for future rate decisions, Grace added.\n\n\u201cThat means the 27.6% pricing for an additional 25 bps cut in December will quickly evaporate, sending U.S. yields and the USD higher.\u201d\n\nIn currencies, the dollar index .DXY was unchanged at 97.822 against a basket of six major currencies. The Japanese yen was a tad lower at 108.72.\n\nSterling GBP= was last trading at $1.2824, barely changed from Friday's close.\n\nThe European Union agreed to London\u2019s request for a Brexit deadline extension but set no new departure date. That gave Britain\u2019s divided parliament time to decide on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s call for a snap election.\n\nEarlier, sources told Reuters the 27 European Union countries that will remain after Brexit hope to agree on Monday to delay Britain\u2019s divorce until Jan. 31 with an earlier departure possible.\n\nThe euro EUR=D3 trod water too at $1.1083.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the calm before a potential storm, where the event risk heats up with political twists and turns, key economic data and central bank meetings,\u201d said Chris Weston, Sydney-based strategist at Pepperstone.\n\nOil prices climbed, supported by optimism on the trade front and by falling U.S. crude stocks.
