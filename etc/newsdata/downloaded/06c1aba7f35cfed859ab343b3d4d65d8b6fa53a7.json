His name is Ryan Anderson and he\u2019s the dog dude. The dog dude that already knows Angie.\n\nIf you\u2019ve somehow dodged the ad, it\u2019s time to watch it.\n\n\"Oh my god I know this guy\" The Dog Whisperer is here and only Angie is happy to see him. #BacheloretteAU 7.30 tomorrow on 10. pic.twitter.com/ytqMCC79WF \u2014 #BacheloretteAU (@BacheloretteAU) October 14, 2019\n\nSo by the looks of it, Angie looks pretty keen on Ryan.\n\nThe 32-year-old is a rescue dog advocate, whose Instagram handle is AussieDogGuy. The dogs, he loves them which is a humongous tick for Angie.\n\nHe also really likes taking pictures with different breeds of floofers.\n\nSpeaking to 10Daily, Ryan said he and Angie DM\u2019d a bit on Instagram before she was announced as the Bachelorette.\n\n\u201cI signed up for the show purely to get to know Angie \u2013 I had a bit of an online crush on her and I wanted to get to know her a bit better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe share a common interest in dogs and the rescue dog scene, and we\u2019ve had a little bit of back and forth over social media for a while, but we had never actually met in person.\u201d\n\nRyan, an ambassador for Empower Assistance Dogs, was planning on asking Angie to the organisation\u2019s annual gala ball but was beaten to it by Bachie.\n\n\u201cThe one girl I had my eye on incidentally turned out be the Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Ryan is followed on IG by Bachie alumni Alex Nation and the Honey Badger. I\u2019ve got no idea what that means but there you go.\n\nThe Bachelorette continues tonight 7.30pm on Channel 10.\n\nIf you want to relive last week\u2019s truly dramatic episodes then aggressively click on our recaps below.", "description": "Angie\u00a0Kent's dramatic as hell ~ journey ~ on The Bachelorette\u00a0continues tonight, and as the previews have teased, we're copping our first intruder.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-11.14.45-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
