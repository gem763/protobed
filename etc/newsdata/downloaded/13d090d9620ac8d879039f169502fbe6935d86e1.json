In a conversation about how to deal with segregation in schools back in 1975, you told a reporter, \u2018I don\u2019t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation, and I\u2019ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.\u2019 You said that some 40 years ago, but as you stand here tonight, what responsibility do you think that Americans need to take to repair the legacy of slavery in our country?\n\nBiden, who\u2019s had a number of foot-in-mouth moments on the campaign trail thus far, unleashed a confusing ramble of a response that included, in part: \u201cWe bring social workers into homes of parents to help them deal with how to raise their children. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to help. They don\u2019t know what\u2014They don\u2019t know what quite what to do. Play the radio. Make sure the television\u2014excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night\u2026\u201d\n\nIn addition to no doubt offending potential African-American voters, the \u201crecord player\u201d gaffe inspired a number of op-eds questioning Biden\u2019s age and fitness to be president (he is 76, which would make him the oldest person ever elected to the office). And now, we can add Oliver\u2019s name to the pile on.\n\n\u201cOh, shit! That is Joe Biden saying \u2018television,\u2019 then replacing it with \u2018record player,\u2019 and then just barely stopping himself from saying \u2018phonograph,\u2019\u201d cracked Oliver, failing to contain his laughter.\n\nHe then added, \u201cAnd let\u2019s all remember that very funny moment when Biden sends a concession telegram to Trump next November!\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d host had fun with the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s strange response.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568605654/cq5dam.web.1200.675_8_lfj9wt", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
