Two weeks ago, he stepped down as CEO at SAP after a decade leading the company. Today, ServiceNow announced that he will be its new CEO.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how quickly the move came together but the plan for him is clear: to scale revenue like he did in his last job.\n\nCommenting during the company\u2019s earning\u2019s call today, outgoing CEO John Donahoe said that McDermott met all of the board\u2019s criteria for its next leader. This includes the ability to expand globally, expand the markets it serves and finally scale the go-to-market organization internally, all in the service of building toward a $10 billion revenue goal. He believes McDermott checks all those boxes.\n\nMcDermott has his work cut out for him. The company\u2019s 2018 revenue was $2.6 billion. Still, he fully embraced the $10 billion challenge. \u201cWell let me answer that very simply, I completely stand by [the $10 billion goal], and I\u2019m looking forward to achieving it,\u201d he said with bravado during today\u2019s call.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that as the company strives to reach that lofty revenue goal in the coming years, it will be doing with a new CEO in McDermott, as well as a new CFO. The company is in the midst of a search to fill that key position, as well.\n\nMcDermott has been here before though. He points out that in the decade he was at SAP, under his leadership the company moved the market cap from $39 billion to $163 billion. Today, ServiceNow\u2019s market cap is similar to when McDermott started at SAP at a little over $41 billion.\n\nHe also recognizes that this is going to be a new challenge. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of different business models, and [SAP has] a very different business model than ServiceNow. This is a pure play cloud,\u201d he said. That means as a leader, he says that has to think about product changes differently, how they fit in the overall platform, while maintaining simplicity and keeping the developer community in mind.\n\nRay Wang, founder and principal analyst at Constellation Research said that ServiceNow is at a point where it needs an enterprise-class CEO who understands tech, partnerships, systems integrators and real enterprise sales and marketing \u2014 and McDermott brings all of that to his new employer.", "description": "Bill McDermott has landed.
