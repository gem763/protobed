At the weekend, in a special sitting of parliament of the kind that is traditionally reserved for starting world wars, the House of Commons failed to have a meaningful vote on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, after the terms of the vote were amended into something else entirely.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, at 3.30pm, the government tried to make the House of Commons have that vote again. But Speaker John Bercow was having none of it.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s motion is in substance the same as Saturday\u2019s motion and the house has decided the matter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will not be debated today.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

this one before? Yes you have. In March of this year, on a Monday afternoon, at 3.30pm, Theresa May wanted to have another vote on her Brexit deal, having already lost three of them. The speaker, John Bercow, told her it wouldn\u2019t be happening.\n\nAnd, in true Groundhog Day fashion, he has now done so again.\n\nThere is one way, of course, you can bring the same vote again \u2013 you have to prorogue parliament, have a Queen\u2019s Speech, and start a new session. But No 10 rather burnt through that particular lifeline in the Supreme Court a few weeks ago.\n\nNo one makes predictions these days, but it is possible that with this latest intervention, Speaker Bercow has brought to an end the Meaningful Vote franchise. No one is quite sure if there were three, four or five editions of it, but there is certainly no disagreement that all have been equally terrible.\n\nNaturally, the glib Brexit symmetries are there. Sir Desmond Swayne rose to tell the speaker that \u201cit is quite right\u201d that the House of Commons should not vote again on the same question, and for the very same reason there should be no second referendum.\n\nReal centre-of-the-forehead genius, that, from an MP who, a few weeks ago, wrote a lengthy blog post on his own website about how it\u2019s absolutely fine for white people to black up, and that he had recently blacked up to attend a fancy dress party as James Brown. So crucial was Sir Desmond\u2019s contribution to the public debate on racism, and indeed so crucial to public debate is Sir Desmond\u2019s own blog, that nobody detected the fact it had been written for almost an entire week.\n\nIt is also, perhaps, fair to suggest there is a slight difference between the government trying again to win a vote it lost not 48 hours before, and the public having a second referendum getting on for four years from the first.\n\nFor the House of Commons to vote again on an issue, Speaker Bercow explained, the \u201csubstance or the circumstances\u201d need to have changed.\n\nA second referendum does not come without peril, but it is reasonable to assume it would no longer be a vote on whether Turkey is joining the EU, and whether Brexit would lead directly to an extra \u00a3350m a week for the NHS.\n\nWe are stuck in what has come to feel like a Brexit word cloud. Bills can\u2019t be voted on without being amended to death.\n\nNo agreement can be approved by the House of Commons without attempts to attach new bits to it, like a customs union, for example, all of which would require approval from the European Union, which is every bit as exasperated by Brexit as we are.\n\nThe proof of the deadlock is overwhelming. A general election can\u2019t solve it either. A referendum would. It is starting to feel like it is a matter of time before that is the one proposal on which the House of Commons will agree.", "description": "It has been Brexit: Groundhog Day for so long now,\u00a0it is not merely that the Brexit: Groundhog Day comparisons have started to feel like Groundhog Day, it\u2019s that comparisons of the comparisons have started to feel like Groundhog Day.
