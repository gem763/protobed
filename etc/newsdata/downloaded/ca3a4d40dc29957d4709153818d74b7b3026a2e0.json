(Virgin Galactic Photo / Stephen Counts)\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a stretch to call them spacesuits, but the \u201cspacewear\u201d clothing line unveiled today by Virgin Galactic and Under Armour looks comfortable enough to wear even if you\u2019re not rocketing to the edge of space.\n\nThe Under Armour clothing line \u2014 which includes a base layer, a spacesuit that\u2019s really a beefed-up flight suit, and zippered flight boots \u2014 made its debut at a New York runway show, and will get its space premiere during test flights for Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo rocket plane.\n\nNext year, Virgin Galactic\u2019s customers are due to wear the custom-made space duds when they climb on board for suborbital trips past the 50-mile space milestone at Spaceport America in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI love the way the spacewear looks, and I love the way it feels,\u201d Virgin Galactic\u2019s billionaire founder, Richard Branson, said in a news release. \u201cI also love the fact that the next time I put it on, I will be on my way to space.\u201d\n\nUnder Armour\u2019s founder and CEO, Kevin Plank, said the clothing line builds on his company\u2019s long experience with designing athletic wear \u2014 and could set a precedent when it goes up on Virgin Galactic\u2019s first commercial spaceflight.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve engineered utilizing our key technologies will define the future of spacewear and puts us at the forefront of this history-making event,\u201d he said.\n\nThe color scheme is deep-space blue, tricked out with touches of gold. The design makes liberal use of Virgin Galactic logos and graphic elements, including the company\u2019s \u201cDNA of Flight\u201d insignia, but there are also spots set aside for astronaut-style patches displaying the flag of the wearer\u2019s home nation and the emblem of their space mission.\n\nThe base layer is made with Under Armour\u2019s breathable Intelliknit fabric, while the spacesuit combines layers of Tencel Luxe, SpinIt and Nomex, with a proprietary form-fitting fabric called UA Clone added to the elbows and knees. There\u2019s extra cushioning built into the shoulder pads and neck region, to help Virgin Galactic\u2019s fliers deal with the strain on their harness straps during high-G portions of the flight.\n\nPassengers will be able to stash their personal items in zippered suit pockets \u2014 including a clear pocket above the heart on the inside of the flight jacket, where photos of loved ones can be kept. Another pocket holds the integrated communications system that\u2019s connected to a push-to-talk button.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect to bring your smartphone aboard for a zero-G selfie. Virgin Galactic won\u2019t allow any sharp items, electronic devices or anything that could cause interference with the spaceship. The company says there\u2019ll be plenty of cameras installed inside the passenger cabin to take selfies and space views automatically.\n\nBranson in spacesuit More\n\nSpace boots More", "description": "It's a bit of a stretch to call them spacesuits, but the \"spacewear\" clothing line unveiled today by Virgin Galactic and Under Armour looks comfortable enough to wear even if you're not rocketing to the edge of space.
