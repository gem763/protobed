Apple also offers Apple News Plus for $10 (about R150) per month, and Apple Arcade, a subscription video game service, for $5 (R75) per month.\n\nWhile combining the services could provide savings for Apple customers, music industry executives are reportedly concerned that a cheaper subscription package would lead to less revenue from Apple Music streaming.\n\nFor more stories go to www.businessinsider.co.za.\n\nApple TV Plus hasn't launched yet, but Apple has already considered packaging its on-demand video service with its streaming music service, Apple Music.\n\nA new report from Anna Nicolaou and Patrick McGee of the Financial Times says that Apple has entered into talks with the music industry to make a subscription bundle a reality, but record labels are concerned that they will lose revenue from the deal.\n\nApple Music is a R59.99 monthly subscription, though Apple customers who buy an iPhone, iPad or Mac get one year of the service for free. Apple TV Plus will launch on November 1 for $5 (about R75) per month, and will feature original TV shows, movies, and documentaries. Earlier this year, Apple launched Apple News Plus for $10 per month, and the $5 per month Apple Arcade, a subscription video game service.\n\nWhile Apple has not formally announced any plans to combine its growing list of subscription services, a discounted bundle would provide additional value to dedicated customers. However, the Financial Times report suggests that music industry executives are wary of accepting a deal that would lead to lower revenue shares from Apple Music streaming.\n\nAccording to the Financial Times, the music industry's skepticism goes back to the early days of Apple's iTunes store, when former Apple CEO Steve Jobs leveraged access to the growing digital marketplace to get record labels to agree to a price of $0.99 (about R0.06)per song.\n\nThe music industry has benefitted from the advent of streaming music service, but licensing negotiations remain a point of tension between streaming platforms and record labels. Industry executives told the Financial Times that Apple Music currently offers a more favourable rate of revenue sharing than Spotify, the world's most popular music streaming service.", "description": "The Financial Times reports that Apple has considered packaging its growing subscription services, but music industry executives remain skeptical.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2831/720ba63dd25a4df5aafb9a7488b3aa9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
