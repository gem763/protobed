The migrants torched several rooms and staff cars and, as a result, managed to take control over a part of the compound for a while.\n\nThe riot was contained only in the early hours of Monday, after the detention center called for the Rapid Intervention Unit of Malta Police Force. The police later said an officer was slightly injured during the operation.\n\nSources stressed that police tried to arrest 2 migrants due to them being drunk, this infused a great anger among the #migrantspic.twitter.com/uK0agcRPCG \u2014 Sharif Bibi (@sharifbibi) 21 October 2019\n\nA series of similar incidents happened in the neighboring Hal Safi Detention Center during summer months and in September. Migrants protested against their detention on the pretext of medical screenings by climbing on the camp\u2019s fence and securing banners saying \u2018freedom\u2019 on it, setting their mattresses on fire, while others even managed to escape the facility.\n\nAlso on rt.com Malta says only Germany, France maintain migrant-sharing commitment\n\nMany of the migrants rescued in the Mediterranean were brought to Malta following the island country\u2019s agreement with three other EU nations - namely Germany, France and Italy - on a \u201ctemporary emergency redistribution mechanism\u201d. However, the subsequent gathering of EU leaders failed to cement that agreement, with less than a half of 28 member nations agreeing to accept rescued migrants. Now most of the migrants brought to Malta during that period are still on the island, stretching its limited reception capacities.\n\nLike this story?
