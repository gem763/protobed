Also known as MLMs, businesses such as Mary Kay, Tupperware, Amway, Arbonne, LuLaRoe and a host of others employ consultants who sell products directly to the public as well as recruit new members.\n\nRuiz was attending school and working full-time, and like many 20-somethings, searching for a fulfilling career. A co-worker introduced her to Mary Kay, an MLM that sells makeup and beauty products, in 2012. The co-worker set up a lunch meeting with her \u201cupline,\u201d the person who recruited her into the company, to pitch Ruiz on joining them. \u201cShe said all the right things,\u201d Ruiz said.\n\nRuiz was promised flexibility, the ability to stay home with her future children and the opportunity to build a business that would eventually allow her to quit working completely.\n\nRuiz also had a lot of student debt that she wanted to pay off, and her co-worker\u2019s upline assured her she could put an extra $400 or $500 a month toward her loans by working for Mary Kay. \u201cThey promise you the world and all the flexibility that you want. They make it seem like this big secret that nobody knows about,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI fell for it.\u201d\n\nMLMs hook people with the promise of becoming independent business owners with unlimited earning potential. But for many, getting caught up in an MLM turns out to be a nightmare. That\u2019s especially true for women, who make up the majority of consultants for these companies.\n\nThe business model of an MLM is designed so that the majority of participants see modest earnings to none at all (somewhere between 73% to 99% earn nothing). A select few at the top, however, enjoy major financial success \u2015 not because they\u2019re genius salespeople, but because they\u2019ve amassed huge \u201cdownlines\u201d and collect enormous commissions and bonuses based on their sales.\n\nSo how do even seemingly intelligent people fall prey to MLMs despite the overwhelming evidence that they\u2019re thinly veiled pyramid schemes? Often, it has to do with the cult-like tactics used to recruit and motivate participants.\n\nUnderstanding The BITE Model\n\nThe comparison between cults and MLMs is not a new one. Amway, one of the largest MLMs in the world, has been the subject of several books that detail the company\u2019s cult-like strategies, including \u201cAmway: The Cult of Free Enterprise\u201d written in 1999 by former distributor Stephen Butterfield.\n\nDouglas M. Brooks, an attorney who specializes in representing victims of pyramid schemes, deceptive MLM programs and business opportunity scams, agreed that Amway is one of the prime examples of how MLMs mirror cults.\n\nBrooks recently presented a working paper at the 2019 International Cultic Studies Association annual conference titled \u201cCoercive Techniques in Business Opportunity Cults.\u201d In the paper, he notes that Butterfield\u2019s experiences with Amway, as well as those of others who have written about their time with this particular MLM, included \u201cmass meetings with enthusiastic distributors giving standing ovations to high level Amway speakers, mysterious terminology, relentless focus on recruitment, positive thinking, the avoidance of any questioning of Amway or its high level distributors, and the tendency for Amway distributors to dedicate more and more of their time and energy to the organization, often at the expense of their relationships with friends and family, despite the lack of financial success.\u201d\n\nAll of these factors, he said, are consistent with the popular perception of what a cult is. To this day, former distributors continue making the comparison. And Amway is just one of many MLMs that function in this way.\n\n\u201cMLMs hook people with the promise of becoming independent business owners with unlimited earning potential. But for many, getting caught up in an MLM turns out to be a nightmare.\u201d\n\nBut what is the true definition of a cult? The term might conjure images of men and women dressed in long, hooded robes, chanting together and drinking toxic Kool-Aid in pursuit of enlightenment. And that is an extreme example of what a cult might look like. However, many cults aren\u2019t so easy to spot.\n\nSteven Hassan escaped the Unification Church (also known as the \u201cMoonies\u201d) in 1976 and has since become a mental health counselor and one of the leading experts on mind control and cults. According to Hassan, a cult is an organization that exercises undue influence over its members to make them dependent and obedient. Undue influence is defined as persuasion that takes over any free will or judgment; as a legal term, it refers to a person or group taking advantage of their position of power over others.\n\nIn cults and other organizations that employ mind control, undue influence is first imposed on victims by showering them with praise and affection and promising a fantasy world or elite status. Once a member is hooked, the organization employs a systematic method of control to disrupt that person\u2019s identity and ability to think independently and rationally.\n\nThat process of gaining undue influence follows what Hassan calls the BITE model:\n\nBehavior Control: This type of control is all about dictating who a person is and what they do. Behavior control can include restricting what types of food a person eats, what they wear, when they sleep and who they are allowed to associate with. Financial exploitation, manipulation or dependence is also often a key component of behavior control. Individualism is discouraged and groupthink is encouraged.\n\nInformation Control: To exert undue influence, cults will often withhold or distort information to make it more acceptable (or simply flat-out lie). Information control involves using deception, discouraging access to non-cult sources of information, encouraging spying on each other and producing propaganda such as newsletters, YouTube videos, movies and other media.\n\nThought Control: Cults will also seek to control how members think so that the group\u2019s doctrine is accepted as the truth. Loaded language and clich\u00e9s are used to stop critical thinking and reduce complex ideas to platitudes and buzzwords. Often, only positive thoughts are allowed; constructive criticism or questions are immediately shut down.\n\nEmotional Control: Members of cults experience extreme emotional highs and lows; they\u2019re showered with praise one moment and then made to feel guilty, fearful and unworthy the next. They\u2019re told that any problems they experience are their own fault and never that of the leader or group. The cult instills irrational fears about leaving or questioning the leader\u2019s authority.\n\nThese are just some of the examples of how cults and other mind-controlling organizations employ the BITE model of undue influence. They likely sound very familiar to current and former MLM participants.\n\nMichael Cogliantry via Getty Images Becoming involved in an MLM often results in a combination of guilt, shame and fear because this is a business where you are not only the victim; you\u2019re also the perpetrator.\n\nHere are some of the biggest ways MLMs mirror cults in their tactics.\n\nMLM Tactic #1: Love Bombing\n\nOne of the reasons MLMs are successful at recruiting new members is because the introduction is made through someone familiar. It doesn\u2019t come from a stranger off the street.\n\nTypically, the first pitch you get is from a friend or family member who invites you to a meeting. However, the details of this meeting are purposely kept vague. All you know is that it\u2019s about a financial opportunity. \u201cIt\u2019s all very mysterious,\u201d Brooks said. The key is getting you to that first meeting.\n\nOnce there, the recruiter uses a technique known as \u201clove bombing.\u201d Love bombing is a term reportedly invented by the Unification Church that has evolved today to mean a type of toxic, manipulative affection.\n\nMLM members will shower prospective recruits with warm welcomes and excitement, saying how wonderful it is that they came, what an exciting opportunity it is and congratulate them for joining. It\u2019s almost as if the recruit is being seduced \u2015 they feel special, important and like they\u2019ve uncovered a precious secret no one else knows about.\n\nThe meeting starts when someone high up in the company inevitably gives their rags-to-riches story. They explain how bad things were before, how they were trapped by debt and a dead-end job. But by selling products for the company, they\u2019ve changed their lives. Meeting attendees are encouraged to pursue the same happy ending.\n\nMeetings are a big part of the MLM culture. \u201cAll of it is designed to get you to the point where you\u2019re willing to give it a shot and sign up as a distributor,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd course, if you\u2019re serious about this business, you\u2019ve got to keep on coming to meetings to learn how to do this.\u201d\n\nA large amount of pressure is placed on recruits to come to weekly meetings, as well as special events such as product parties and conferences. They pay out of pocket to attend these events.\n\nHoping to achieve the same level of success as the Mary Kay spokespeople she met at meetings, Ruiz bought about $1,500 worth of products within the first two months of joining. She attended meetings often, as much as once or twice per week. She spent so much time working on her business that it eventually began to affect her relationship with her now-husband.\n\n\u201cThey always want you doing things for the business,\u201d she said. \u201cYou work nine to five, and then you get off at five and go to the Mary Kay meeting until nine at the earliest,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t see him.\u201d\n\nTactic #2: The Art Of Deception\n\nThe people who get up onstage to talk about the incredible income they earn and luxurious lifestyles they live don\u2019t actually make that money selling products, Brooks said. Rather, the income is generated by a huge downline, and it\u2019s only available to a tiny fraction of the group (those near the top of the pyramid).\n\n\u201cThe truth is that you\u2019re not going to be that person on the stage,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThat person has a very intimate relationship with the officers of the company. In addition to the commissions that they\u2019re getting paid based on their downline, they\u2019re getting money from selling recruitment tools and systems, and they may also be getting additional compensation from the company for appearing at meetings and speaking.\u201d\n\nEventually, the allure of the Mary Kay lifestyle wore off. Unimpressed with her results and tired of hounding her friends and family members to make sales, Ruiz let her Mary Kay business fall to the wayside. A couple of years later, however, she fell for another MLM pitch and dabbled in Younique. At the time, the makeup company was fairly new and she thought she could get in on the ground up. Now, instead of attending meetings in someone\u2019s home, she spent hours online, watching Facebook live presentations and learning how to hook new customers on Younique products through carefully crafted cold messages.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d get really irritated if people weren\u2019t participating,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was all about empowerment and building the life you want, but if you didn\u2019t attend these groups ... they\u2019d sound kind of pissy.\u201d\n\nBut Ruiz didn\u2019t believe in the products and found the experience to be underwhelming. \u201cI put about $500 into it and got maybe five orders. Two of them were my mom,\u201d she said. So she left after a few months.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d get really irritated if people weren\u2019t participating. It was all about empowerment and building the life you want, but if you didn\u2019t attend these groups ... they\u2019d sound kind of pissy.\u201d - Caitlin Ruiz, 30\n\nIn 2015, Ruiz was invited to another Mary Kay party and went only in a show of support for her friend. After attending, however, she was hooked again thanks to a particularly charming speaker who convinced her she just didn\u2019t go about the business the right way before. This woman gave her special attention and listened as she lamented about everything from her skin problems to the stressors of her upcoming wedding.\n\n\u201cI decided that night because of her confidence, because of her willingness to work with me on my skin and because I felt like I had given up this product that I should have never gone away from,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cI thought, \u2018This time, I\u2019m going to rock it. Especially under this lady.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom then on, Ruiz was in constant communication with her upline. They attended the weekly meetings together and regularly met for lunch to discuss the business. Ruiz received endless texts and phone calls from her upline. She described her as a mother-like figure who used everything from her fears about the cost of her upcoming wedding to her longing to spend more time visiting her parents in Michigan as fuel to keep at it. \u201cAgain, I put a lot of money into products,\u201d she said.\n\nTactic #3: Financial Exploitation\n\nDespite all her effort, Ruiz didn\u2019t come close to making a profit. She said the largest sales she ever made were around $200, though most were along the lines of $25 to $50. Considering how much product consultants were expected to keep on hand, \u201cyou\u2019re not making back crap,\u201d she said.\n\nIf MLMs were legitimate businesses, there wouldn\u2019t need to be such a strong emphasis on recruitment. Retail sales would support the business model.\n\nBut Brooks explained that the nature of multilevel marketing forces these companies to be recruitment machines due to the rate of attrition. \u201cThe one thing you\u2019ll never see [an MLM] disclose unless they have a gun to their head is what their attrition rates are,\u201d he said. The longer they can keep consultants on board, the better the company will do financially \u2015 especially those at the top of the pyramid. But ultimately, if all you\u2019re doing is buying and selling products, it\u2019s nearly impossible to make any money.\n\n\u201cIn essence, you have an unlimited number of recruiters who are all selling the same stuff at the same prices,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIf you look at what\u2019s really going on, there are some retail sales \u2026 but it\u2019s not an efficient way of selling. Making a few bucks here and there isn\u2019t going to do it.\u201d\n\nBrooks added that when you look at the compensation plans of MLMs, there\u2019s usually a monthly purchase obligation, though these companies will often deny that\u2019s the case and attempt to dress that requirement up as something else.\n\n\u201cYou have to really get into the weeds of the compensation plan with each company, but ultimately, you find that in order to really participate, you\u2019ve got to buy $100 or $500 worth of stuff every month,\u201d he said. Often, you can\u2019t reap the benefits of the downline you\u2019ve created unless you meet that inventory purchase qualification. In essence, the employees of MLMs also end up their biggest customers.\n\nAccording to Brooks, a major problem with the MLM industry is the fact that these companies are not bound by the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s franchise rule, since the initial buy-in is usually less than $500. That means MLMs don\u2019t have to disclose important information such as business costs, success and attrition rates, and other financial details to help consultants make an informed decision before joining.\n\n\u201cFrankly, if you knew and you understood and you thought about it, you\u2019d never join an MLM,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that even with the companies that do provide some disclosures \u2015 and even though those disclosures are flawed \u2015 they still show that a tiny percentage of people make money \u2026 and yet, those companies don\u2019t seem to have any trouble recruiting people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing you\u2019ll never see [an MLM] disclose unless they have a gun to their head is what their attrition rates are.\u201d - Douglas M. Brooks, attorney\n\nIt was during one lunch meeting with her upline that Ruiz realized her business wasn\u2019t the glamorous opportunity she was made to believe. \u201cShe basically broke down for me how she makes her income,\u201d Ruiz said. It became clear that the way to make money was not by selling products, but by recruiting a downline that would do the selling for her.\n\nAfter crunching the numbers, Ruiz knew the women telling their success stories at parties probably didn\u2019t earn as much as they said they did.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that dawned on me was holy shit, this actually is a pyramid scheme,\u201d she said. \u201cI realized at that point in time what it actually took to be successful at that kind of business and I didn\u2019t like it. So I stopped accepting her phone calls.\u201d\n\nTactic #4: Guilt, Shame, Fear\n\nWhen it comes to MLMs, having a regular 9-to-5 job is considered a failure. Members are fearful of becoming stuck in the rat race or unable to reach all of their goals because they\u2019re limited by their paychecks. MLMs prey on this desire to \u201cown\u201d a business with flexible hours and limitless earning potential.\n\nBut when consultants reach out to their uplines and complain that reality isn\u2019t matching up to what was promised, the blame is always placed back on them. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that they tell you when you get to that place of discouragement is that \u2018You get out of it what you put into it,\u2019\u201d Ruiz explained. Never mind that the market might be saturated, the products inferior or the limited network of potential customers fed up with hearing about it. \u201cIf stuff isn\u2019t moving, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d\n\nBrooks said becoming involved in an MLM often results in a combination of guilt, shame and fear because this is a business where you are not only the victim; you\u2019re also the perpetrator. \u201cNot only were you sucked into it; you\u2019ve sucked other people in,\u201d Brooks said. And for those who eventually recognize what the business is really about, the realization that they\u2019ve roped loved ones into the same situation is demoralizing. \u201cYou know that it\u2019s just not going to work,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re basically just turning this person into a means to your own end. It doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d\n\nIn fact, according to Brooks, victims of pyramid schemes are the least likely of consumers who\u2019ve been defrauded to actually report it. \u201cAs part of the cultic conditioning that takes place, [what] you\u2019re taught right from the beginning is that if you fail, it\u2019s your own fault,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe system is perfect. You just didn\u2019t follow it well enough, or you didn\u2019t stay with it long enough.\u201d", "description": "A former Mary Kay consultant recounts how the multilevel marketing company kept her loyal, even though she wasn't making any money.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d51bbaf2400003200b73ad0.jpeg?ops=1778_1000"}
