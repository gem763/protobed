We don't really know if it's an animal, if it's a fungus or if it's something between the two,\"\n\n- Can it think? -\n\nLong considered a fungus, the blob was reclassified in the 1990s in the group of myxomycetes or slime moulds, a subcategory of the amoeba family.\n\n\"It is capable of memory, it is capable of adapting its behaviour, it is capable of solving problems, of moving around a labyrinth, of optimising solutions, of behaving a little like an animal. So it's a very curious being, a very curious living being,\" said David.\n\nOn its website, the zoo marvels at the blob's \"surprising abilities\".\n\n\"Even though it has no mouth, stomach or eyes, it can detect the presence of food and ingest it... Cut into pieces, the blob will self-heal in two minutes! It does not have two different sexes, but close to 720, so reproduction is not a problem,\" it explains.\n\nThe creature can procreate on its own.\n\nBut as with most other species, survival is boosted by genetic diversity, which in the blob's case happens by two genetically-diverse organisms meeting and fusing into a new, single blob.\n\nA study published in 2016 redefined our understanding of intelligence by concluding that the blob, a creature with no central nervous system, can \"learn\" from experience and change its behaviour accordingly.\n\nIn lab experiments, scientists observed the slime adapt its route over a narrow bridge to a food source after they introduced an unpleasant, though not harmful, obstacle.\n\n- Hard to kill -\n\nSloth-like propulsion does not make it an obvious crowd-puller, but the zoo has come up with a plan, setting up an interactive display that includes a speeded-up video of the blob advancing by extending finger-like protrusions called pseudopods.\n\nIt may move painfully slowly, but in ideal conditions, the blob can grow at breakneck speed -- doubling in size every day.\n\nAnd it is hard to kill: when exposed to danger it goes into hibernation and dries out.\n\nIn this vegetative mode, \"it is nigh immortal,\" blob specialist Audrey Dussutour of France's CNRS research institute told AFP.\n\n\"You can even put it in the microwave for a few minutes\".\n\nBut just add a few drops of water, and \"voila!\" the blob comes to life again, looking to feed and procreate, which it does by producing and releasing spores that grow into new, baby blobs.\n\n\"Blobs of any size can be created, there is no known limit\", said Dussutour.\n\nBlobs up to 10 metres (33 feet) wide have been grown in the lab.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Paris zoo's latest attraction is a brainless, eyeless, single-celled organism with no limbs or stomach but more than 700 genders.
