Back on home soil, he opined that Morey's tweet showed \u201che wasn't educated on the situation\u201d and that his statement had endangered people \u2014 \u201cnot only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually.\u201d\n\nMany Americans and Hong Kongers laced into James for seeming to undermine the cause of Hong Kong protesters for reasons of financial self-interest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile drawing headlines because of how some players, coaches and owners seemed to prioritize the bottom line over freedom, this is far from the first time that sport has made waves in the relationship between Americans and Chinese.\n\nThe history of sports diplomacy between the United States and China holds lessons for what the NBA\u2019s next play should be. Americans should stick to their guns \u2014 as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has \u2014 and avoid bowing to Chinese pressure to discipline Morey \u2014 as James has. Standing up for principle will most probably gain the respect of the Chinese.\n\nThe current era of Sino-American contacts began with sports: the famous ping-pong diplomacy of 1971. That moment brought amateur American table tennis players out of their garages and into Mao\u2019s China at a time when there was no official contact between the governments of the two countries. That visit helped precipitate Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to China the following year and kick-started a program of sporting exchange visits that continued throughout the 1970s. The Chinese proclaimed that they would follow a principle of \u201cFriendship First, Competition Second.\u201d But if friendship came first, politics \u2014 and even conflict \u2014 followed close behind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nControversies were common in the first years of sporting contact between the two countries. In 1972, a return leg of ping-pong diplomacy held in the United States saw cacophonous, sometimes violent protests in which the Chinese players were goaded to defect and pelted with dead rats by protesters. And in 1975, a U.S. track and field team disrupted a final dinner in their honor with a fistfight among their ranks, fueled by fierce Chinese liquor.\n\nThen, in 1978, China threatened to cancel a trip by America's best volleyballers because their coach held an Israeli passport, at a time when Beijing refused any dealings with that state. In all cases, the Chinese were disturbed by the behavior of Americans; often, they demanded that Americans bend their own rules to defuse the situation.\n\nBut the United States refused. Protests at the ping-pong games were allowed to continue, albeit with a CIA security detail providing physical protection for the Chinese players. The U.S. volleyball coach eventually got his visa, despite his Israeli citizenship. And the Americans avoided apologies: As one of the most senior figures on the track and field trip commented after that visit\u2019s drunken brawl, \u201cAmericans will be Americans\u201d and \u201cThe Chinese will have to learn that.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the 1970s, when the Chinese protested American insensitivities, U.S. organizers of athletic exchanges simply stated that they could not \u2014 and would not \u2014 control the lawful behavior of Americans, however inconvenient and uncomfortable it was for both visitors and hosts.\n\nThe record shows that the Chinese respected that stance. However alien it was to the sensibilities of a Mao-era apparatchik, U.S. freedom of speech was far from unintelligible to astute officials; they knew that when their U.S. counterparts said it was beyond their power to prevent their compatriots protesting (or brawling), they were being honest. China\u2019s reaction to a firm U.S. stance was to vocally register its discontent \u2014 but then to allow a resumption of business as normal.\n\nIt might be argued that the NBA today has too much to lose to take such a principled stance, given China\u2019s rising economic and geopolitical power. Past years have seen U.S. companies from Delta to Marriott bow to Chinese pressure, whether to remove Taiwan from a drop-down list of countries or to sanction their employees\u2019 tweets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut history suggests that the storm will blow over if Americans hold the line and show sensitivity that stops short of censure. This is already happening in the latest row: A ban on televising the NBA has already been lifted for all but the Houston Rockets, while Chinese media has noticeably cooled its treatment of this issue (seemingly on orders from above).\n\nChina is likely to back down as it did in the 1970s because its outspoken criticism of American behavior is not actually intended for American audiences, nor do the Chinese have any interest in severing their ties to the NBA. Kicking up a fuss about Morey\u2019s tweet isn\u2019t an effort to censure Morey or clash with the United States, but to promote Beijing\u2019s domestic narrative that Hong Kongers are being stirred up by nefarious outside forces that want to use domestic turbulence to undermine and split China.\n\nSimilarly, China\u2019s clashes with the United States on the issue of Taiwan since the 1970s have acted as a rallying cry for audiences at home and a veiled threat to the people of Taiwan.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Chinese ping-pong players visited the United States in 1972, their visit was delayed by Premier Zhou Enlai because a rival team from Taiwan traveled to America on the dates that the Chinese were planning to visit. By postponing the high-profile visit, China reminded Washington that it objected to having contacts \u2014 diplomatic or sporting \u2014 with the United States while the country also dealt with Taiwan. What Beijing was really signaling was its expectation that Washington should switch official diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing (the United States finally did, nearly seven years later).\n\nBut it is U.S. government policies such as these that Beijing objects to far more than the words of an NBA executive with no ability to change American policy. The Chinese understand that the ambiguities and tensions in the relationship between the U.S. and Chinese governments and societies are long-standing: The same issues that complicated sporting exchanges in the 1970s are the subject of disputes today. There is no need, then, to duck these issues as James suggested Morey should have done.\n\nNeither side should pretend to be something it is not. Americans tweet their opinions about political issues, even regarding countries about which they are not \u201ceducated.\u201d James might have found the timing of Morey\u2019s tweet inconvenient, but Americans should not succumb to a deference that borders on censorship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere is value in being respectful and sensitive in sports diplomacy. From ping-pong diplomacy onward, both Americans and Chinese have celebrated sporting encounters as a binding agent in relations between the two peoples. The huge popularity of the NBA in China is testament to this: Exhibition games of the sort that were held last week were first held in China in the 1970s. Both sides have sought to conduct those encounters under the logic of \u201cFriendship First.\u201d But when politics become embroiled in sporting contacts, the best approach to Chinese remonstrations has been to acknowledge the Chinese perspective and their right to express it \u2014 but to insist that such logic should apply to Americans, too.\n\nAD", "description": "China has long understood that Americans will be Americans, on and off the court.", "authors": ["Pete Millwood", "Pete Millwood Is An Lse Fellow In East Asian History At The London School Of Economics.
