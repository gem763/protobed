(She refused.)\n\n\u201cTristan thinks people are disposable \u2014 if he sends me enough flowers or enough text messages, I\u2019m going to come around,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI still have not spoken to Tristan face-to-face and right now, I am not ready to,\u201d she continued. \u201cI know I\u2019ll get to that place, but right now it\u2019s really challenging and tough for me. My feelings are super raw and I am really humiliated and hurt by what he did to me.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Says She Wants Everyone to \u2018Move On\u2019 from the Tristan Thompson, Jordyn Woods Cheating Scandal\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty; Michael Loccisano/Getty More\n\nThe only issue? Their daughter True\u2018s first birthday was coming up April 12, and while Khlo\u00e9 didn\u2019t want to see him, she felt it would be unfair towards True to shut her dad out of the celebrations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first time Tristan and I will be in a public setting together,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m envisioning a party full of people, Tristan walks in and everyone is staring at us \u2014 I don\u2019t want this at my daughter\u2019s first birthday party.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll Tristan does is sent countless amounts of flowers, calls, texts, and I just haven\u2019t been ready to talk to him because I feel like it\u2019s going to turn into a screaming match and I don\u2019t care to scream,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I said that I would be willing for the first time to speak to him if there\u2019s a therapist involved.\u201d\n\nThey ended up doing an off-camera therapy session via FaceTime \u201cto help co-parent True,\u201d but according to Khlo\u00e9, it didn\u2019t exactly go well \u2014 and left her wanting to un-invite him from the party.\n\n\u201cIt was a really, really hard time for me. I am fighting with myself now,\u201d she reflected. \u201cDid I make the right choice by including Tristan in True\u2019s birthday party?\u201d\n\nHer mom Kris Jenner urged her to be the bigger person. \u201cNobody wants to be left out of the memories that are made,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not going to tell you what to do with Tristan because those feelings are still really raw, I am just asking you to be a little easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully when True looks back at all the pictures, she\u2019ll see both of her parents there having a good time,\u201d she added.\n\nUltimately, Khlo\u00e9 decided Thompson could still come, but she invited him over the night before so they could \u201cget the whole initial weird first seeing each other out of the way in private.\u201d Their reunion wasn\u2019t filmed for the show, but the next day, Khlo\u00e9 filled her assistant in on how it went, admitting it was \u201cpretty awkward.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was just kind of lingering \u2026 He was like, \u2018So, do you want to grab a glass of wine?'\u201d she said, adding that Thompson even tried to kiss her after she reluctantly gave him a hug.\n\n\u201cI go, \u2018This is the problem with you. You can\u2019t just take what you get,'\u201d she said. \u201cThen this morning he was like, \u2018Thank you for letting me see True. She looked great, you looked even better.\u2019 \u2026 Sometimes I feel like if I give an inch, he\u2019ll take a mile and take my kindness for weakness.\u201d", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Says Tristan Thompson Sent Her 'Countless' Flowers After Split", "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7svxZ.w7ddKJPafqvq3ohg--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ecc30ea3004995cc610c04f7d73877a8", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
