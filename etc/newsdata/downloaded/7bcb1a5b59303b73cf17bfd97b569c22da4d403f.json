Quotas get more stringent over time, with 100% designated for screening by the end of 2020.\n\nThe data helps screeners predict which packages might contain fentanyl.\n\nThe postal service stepped up its efforts, though it\u2019s been unable to meet the law\u2019s benchmarks.\n\nThe postal service was screening about 85% of Chinese packages and 60% of the international flow as of June, Chief U.S. Postal Inspector Gary R. Barksdale told Congress in mid-July.\n\nMr. Barksdale will join Mr. Carroll in China, along with Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
