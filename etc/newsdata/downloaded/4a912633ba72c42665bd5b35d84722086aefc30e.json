A SoftBank spokesman declined to comment on the report.\n\nShares in SoftBank fell as much as 2.7% in Tokyo morning trade\n\nSoftBank this week agreed to spend more than $10 billion to take over WeWork, doubling down on an ill-fated investment in the U.S. office-space sharing startup.\n\nMoody's analyst Motoki Yanase said the $5 billion dollar writedown would have a \"relatively small\" effect on SoftBank's investment portfolio, which stood at about $240 billion as of June.\n\nMoody's affirmed SoftBank Group's credit rating at Ba1 on Wednesday, one notch below investment grade.\n\nBut Yanase added that the possibility that WeWork's situation could deteriorate further could not be ruled out. \"SoftBank may need to mobilize more debt to rescue the company,\" he said.\n\nWeWork abandoned its initial public offering last month, after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and the way it was being run.\n\nAs part of SoftBank's bailout, WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann agreed to relinquish control of the company in exchange for a $1.7 billion payoff.\n\nThe bailout comes as SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is seeking to raise $108 billion for its second Vision Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Chang-Ran Kim and Rocky Swift; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "SoftBank Group Corp  is poised to write down at least $5 billion to account for a sharp drop in the value of some of its biggest holdings including WeWork and Uber Technologies Inc , Bloomberg reported.
