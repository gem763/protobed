He is buried in the latter city alongside his wife Nora Barnacle. She died in 1951, a decade after her husband. The councillors argue that the plans would honour the wishes of both.\n\n\u201cExile was a key element in his writing but for it to follow him into eternity? I don\u2019t think that was part of the plan,\u201d McCartan said.\n\nAccording Dr Fritz Senn \u2013 an eminent scholar who established the Zurich James Joyce Foundation more than 30 years ago and currently serves as its director, the author\u2019s wishes are unclear.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that there seems to be no evidence that Joyce wanted to return to Ireland or even be buried there,\u201d Senn said. \u201cHe never took Irish citizenship when he could have done it. Most Joyce experts would agree.\u201d\n\nSenn dubbed the controversy \u201cthe Battle of the Bones\u201d, adding that the project \u201chas not been thought through\u201d, and that the diplomatic process required is fraught with difficulties.\n\n\u201cThe Zurich grave contains four bodies, of Joyce, Nora and Giorgio, the son,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is also Asta Osterwalder Joyce, Giorgio\u2019s second wife, who would have no relation to Ireland at all. There would also be some local resistance on this side.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cemetery where he is buried is called Friedhof Fluntern, and the city is quite proud of the grave. A natural reaction. And then Joyce\u2019s last refuge was Zurich.\u201d\n\nJoyce left Ireland in 1904 to live in Trieste, Paris and Zurich, never returning to his homeland after 1912. The writer had a complex relationship with the country, which in effect banned Ulysses over its \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201canti-Irish\u201d content. He \u201cdecries Irish society\u2019s conservatism, pietism and blinkered nationalism\u201d in his writing, according to an essay from the Irish Emigration Museum curator Jessica Traynor. One of the characters in his novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man describes Ireland as \u201cthe old sow that eats her farrow\u201d.\n\nAlthough Joyce \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear to live in Dublin\u201d, Traynor continues, his \u201cspiritual and artistic engagement with the city continued until the end of his life\u201d. When he lived in Paris, his \u201cfavourite pastime was to seek out visitors from Dublin and ask them to recount the names of the shops and pubs from Amiens Street to Nelson\u2019s Column on O\u2019Connell Street\u201d.\n\nWhen Joyce died aged 58 after undergoing surgery on a perforated ulcer, Ireland\u2019s secretary of external affairs sent the order: \u201cPlease wire details about Joyce\u2019s death. If possible find out if he died a Catholic.\u201d Neither of the two Irish diplomats in Switzerland at the time attended his funeral, and the Irish government later denied Barnacle\u2019s request to repatriate his remains.\n\nIf the Dublin city councillors\u2019 motion is passed, the next step will be to ask the Irish government to request the remains be returned before the centenary celebrations around the publication of Ulysses in 2022. A spokeswoman for culture minister Josepha Madigan told theJournal.ie it was \u201ca matter in the first instance for family members and/or the trustees of the Joyce estate\u201d.\n\n\u201cWithout having received an application from those it would not be appropriate for the minister to express a view on the matter,\u201d she added.\n\nSenn predicted that Joyce\u2019s grandson, Stephen Joyce, who has guarded his grandfather\u2019s legacy closely over the years, would be unlikely to back the motion. \u201cEverything depends on his vote \u2013 negative, most likely,\u201d said Senn. Attempts to reach Stephen Joyce were unsuccessful.\n\nDespite the intensifying row, Senn declared he would not fight to keep Joyce in Switzerland: \u201cI myself am not nationalistic enough to mount the barricades for a body.\u201d", "description": "Proposal to repatriate author\u2019s remains to Dublin from Zurich have met resistance from the Swiss James Joyce Foundation", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d300763e4e79e4a405935a4b72d557d96021cfb/0_163_3900_2340/master/3900.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=17734fbbd27b8f7ea84e5d75e58cbb75", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
