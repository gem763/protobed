Think of Don Quixote disporting himself as a knight of yore; of Pedro Almodovar\u2019s characters experimenting with their personas, of Picasso\u2019s portraits triumphing as portraits even when both the sitter\u2019s eyes are on one side of her head.\n\nMost poignant of all is Garcia Lorca\u2019s plaintive line Pero yo ya no soy yo \u2014 But I am no longer me.\n\nLorca died in 1936, presumed murdered by Francisco Franco\u2019s forces during the early days of the Spanish Civil War. Spain. In the 1960s, when Berta Isla and her husband, Tomas Nevinson, were growing up in Madrid, Franco still gripped the country in a dictatorship that punished nay-sayers with imprisonment, torture and executions.\n\nBerta lives to see better days in Spain after Franco\u2019s death in 1975. Tomas lives, too. The son of a British father and a Spanish mother he is not only bilingual, but has an extraordinary talent for language acquisition and mimicry \u2014 a perfect job qualification for a spy.\n\nBut Tomas wants to become no such thing. After Oxford, he hopes only to return to Madrid, marry Berta and live a comfortable life. But with his language skills, he\u2019s too valuable to let go, and he is coerced into British military intelligence.\n\nTomas spends months on missions that he can never describe to Berta so the companionable marriage they had planned can never be. Instead, as Tomas explains, his life was replaced with another life, and \u201cIt\u2019s too late now to recover the life I thought I would live. Parallel time also passes.\u201d\n\nA third-person narrator tells Tomas\u2019 story, but not in detail, at least not about his missions. There\u2019s a long central section focusing on Britain\u2019s war with the Argentinians over the Falkland Islands in 1982. Terrorists were fighting it in Northern Ireland at the same time.\n\nTomas could have been in either place \u2014 or most likely, it seems, in both. Berta tells her own story, so we see her anxieties, live with her as she and her children grow older, and she fits her life into a pattern shaped by her husband\u2019s work.\n\nThe dual narration creates a tension between what Berta and Tomas experience and suffer. The reader, who hears and participates in both stories, is poised painfully between them, bereft by the knowledge that they cannot know what the other has endured because they have hidden their personal worlds from each other.\n\nAlso hidden \u2014 or at least densely veiled \u2014 is where Tomas operated or what he did. Though readers learn more than Berta knows, none of it is detailed. In contrast, his state of mind, his musings, are investigated minutely. Hypotheses are buttressed or undermined with reservations, other possibilities, illustrations, counter-arguments, and literary references \u2014 especially to Eliot and Shakespeare.\n\nConstructed of long exploratory sentences these meditations map the toll of Tomas\u2019 work more frighteningly than any carefully plotted life-as-a spy tale could ever do.\n\nEqually memorable are several sharply focused set-pieces. Among them are Tomas\u2019 final undergraduate adventure with an Oxford girl; the teen-age Berta\u2019s pursuit by one of Franco\u2019s policeman intent on beating her; even more, her terror when she realizes that two acquaintances are threatening to kill her baby with a cigarette lighter and spilled lighter fluid.\n\nAt one point, Tomas and Berta discuss the scene in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cHenry V\u201d when the king masquerades as an ordinary soldier on the night before the battle of Agincourt. Perceiving him as one of themselves, his soldiers chat frankly with him. Next day, when the battle\u2019s fought and won, they encounter him again, and realize that they have not spoken advisedly.\n\nPunishment seems likely. But would it be fair, given that the soldiers did not know they were speaking to the king? As a man used to infiltrating other groups, Tomas speaks as a professional spy; as a woman whose life has been manipulated, Berta differs.\n\nReaders will perhaps judge between them. Certainly, they will always see or read this scene as an exemplum of deceit.\n\nDeceit and arbitrary power are the dynamos of this dense, compelling novel by one of Europe\u2019s most admired authors. It\u2019s long: 480 pages, but time reading and thinking about it will be well-spent.\n\n\u2022 Claire Hopley is a writer and editor in Amherst, Mass.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBERTA ISLA: A NOVEL\n\nBy Javier Marias\n\nAlfred A Knopf, $28.95,496 pages\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
