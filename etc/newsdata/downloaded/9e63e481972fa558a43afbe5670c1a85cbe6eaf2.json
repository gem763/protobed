You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn September 2017, local environmental activist Ruben Arzaga was shot dead while trying to confiscate illegally harvested timber on Palawan. Police detained two suspects known to be illegal loggers on suspicion of murder.\n\nAccording to a group of Palawan-based NGOs, Arzaga is one of 12 local environmentalists to have been murdered since 2004 for trying to protect the island\u2019s forests against illegal logging, much of it to build luxury hotels aimed at wealthy tourists jetting in from Europe, the US and beyond.\n\nIn one particularly brutal incident recounted in the Global Witness report an environmental activist was allegedly tortured and had his penis cut off before his body was buried on the beach.\n\nMaremegmeg, which opened in 2018, is owned by a company belonging to a prominent local figure.\n\nProving culpability for individual attacks remains difficult, especially when police may be unwilling to investigate powerful figures and groups. But the report reveals a disturbing pattern of violence against Filipino citizens standing up against businesses in defence of the environment.\n\nIn July, Global Witness named the Philippines the most deadly country in the world for defenders of the environment with 34 confirmed killings in 2018.\n\nThe violence is not confined to the seemingly tranquil beaches of El Nido.\n\nOrchards growing bananas and pineapples destined for western markets have uprooted indigenous people and rural communities from their land in the name of economic development.\n\nOn 3 February 2017, on the island of Mindanao, Renato Anglao was driving home on a motorbike with his wife and five-year-old son. Three unidentified gunmen drew up beside him and shot him in the head, a police report shows. He was pronounced dead when he arrived at hospital.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He was secretary general of the Tribal Indigenous Oppressed Group Association (Tindoga), a group that campaigned against the large-scale illegal conversion of land belonging to indigenous groups for banana, pineapple and sugarcane to supply companies like Del Monte Philippines.\n\nDel Monte Philippines grows fruit in the area to sell globally, including to the US market. It had contracted a local businessman and mayor, Pablo Lorenzo III, to cultivate pineapples.\n\nLorenzo had been accused of violence against activists over a number of years in numerous news reports, but has never been convicted of any crimes. Despite the accusations, Del Monte Philippines continued to deal with him.\n\nThe Independent has been unable to contact Lorenzo, and Del Monte Philippines did not respond to requests for comment. But the company is cited in the Global Witness report as saying that it \u201cdid not know about\u201d Renato Anglao\u2019s murder, which was widely reported locally.\n\nDel Monte Philippines said it \u201chad no factual or legal basis to terminate our growership agreement\u201d.\n\nThe investigation cites numerous examples across a variety of sectors in which business interests have been linked to murders of activists who stand in their way.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
