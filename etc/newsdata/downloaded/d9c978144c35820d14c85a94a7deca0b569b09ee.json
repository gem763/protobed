Landfill search experts with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children identified an area where human remains and other evidence in the case would most likely be found.\n\nSumter Police Department\n\nThen, some 400 people from more than 40 agencies searched through about 4 million pounds of material at the Waste Management-Richland County landfill for Nevaeh's body, according to police.\n\n\u201cThe local community and the state as a whole have been profoundly impacted by this case,\u201d Roark said. \u201cIt is our hope that the recovery of Nevaeh will provide a sense of peace to her family, the community, and the hundreds of men and women who participated in this effort.\u201d\n\nThe little girl had been missing since her mother, 29-year-old Sharee Bradley, was found dead inside their apartment in Sumter on the night of Aug. 5. Nevaeh was nowhere to be found.\n\nDaunte Maurice Johnson, 28, was arrested a short distance away from the crime scene after he was seen fleeing the neighborhood.\n\nPolice said Johnson, who was an acquaintance of Bradley's, confessed to killing both the mother and child. He also allegedly provided information that could help authorities locate Nevaeh's body. Police then shifted their missing persons investigation for the little girl to a \"recovery effort.\"\n\nJohnson has been charged with their murders and was being held at the Sumter County Sheriff's Office Detention Center. Police said he has a criminal record in other states and is a suspect in a Missouri homicide.\n\n\u201cWe will continue working with the 3rd Circuit Solicitor\u2019s Office to bring this case to trial,\" Roark said.", "description": "Authorities in South Carolina say they have found the remains of 5-year-old Nevaeh Adams.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/nevaeh-adams-02-as-ht-190807_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
