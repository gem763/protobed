If their judgement is correct, they will receive one coin at settlement \u2014 thereby having bought the token at a discounted rate. If wrong, traders will receive nothing, thus losing their investment.\n\nTraders will also be able to bet against Libra launching in 2020, with gains for both long and short trades to be capped at $1.1 per Libra to account for fluctuations in the value of the currencies backing the token, revealed Lamb. He told Bloomberg that:\n\n\u201cFacebook has the ability to rival the entire global banking system from day one, but, because of that fact, when that first day will be is far from certain. The political backlash has been brutal, and it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if Facebook will get this over the line.\u201d\n\nA \u201cprediction market\u201d for Libra\n\nSu Zhu, the CEO of Singapore-based foreign exchange and crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, told Bloomberg that his platform was also considering markets for Libra, noting:\n\n\u201cThis can be interesting if it gathers liquidity as its kind of a prediction market on Libra.\u201d\n\nAmid the robust regulatory pushback, Libra\u2019s creators have given increasingly mixed signals as to the coin\u2019s eventual expected launch date.\n\nIn mid-September, Bertrand Perez, the director general of the Libra Association, has said that the token should appear in the second half of 2020.\n\nThat same month, head of Calibra David Marcus has reiterated that a 2020 launch remains the goal, noting that the team behind the project would need to address all concerns adequately and to create a suitable regulatory environment.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has meanwhile stopped short of committing to a timeframe, conceding that the project was potentially \u201cvery sensitive for society\u201d and noting that, given the scale it operates at, Facebook must \u201cwork through the issues\u201d thoroughly before Libra\u2019s launch.\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported on Aug. 26, Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency futures exchange CoinFlex has received $10 million through a funding round.", "description": "A crypto derivatives exchange is launching physically-delivered futures contracts that will be settled based on whether Facebook\u2019s Libra does or does not launch...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMWFhMTlmMmNiNTUxYTlkOGZhZGFjZDFjNjdiY2M4YmQuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
