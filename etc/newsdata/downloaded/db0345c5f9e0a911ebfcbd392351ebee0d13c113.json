He began terrorising her in the fallout, while claiming she made up the attack.\n\nRobert has been wanting revenge, and last month he ended up hospitalising Lee after a fight - with Robert now facing prison charges.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBut things escalate next week when Lee dies, with Robert and husband Aaron soon realising the trouble he will now be in.\n\nAaron actor Danny Miller has promised heartbreaking scenes to come, admitting that the emotions viewers will see will be very \"real\".\n\nHe said of filming the end of Robron: \"We\u2019ve done some of it and there\u2019s real raw emotion there for Ryan and myself.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"During one of the emotional scenes, it hit me that it\u2019s real and it\u2019s actually happening and there are some genuine tears in there.\n\n\"We\u2019ve been very close for 4 years and it\u2019s not going to be the same without him, but the show goes on too so to speak and it\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens with Ryan - and Aaron in the show - too.\"\n\nSpeaking about Aaron's own plans to leave the village after Lee's death, Danny revealed things happen very quickly.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHe said: \"The goodbyes are rushed. You can see that Aaron and Robert almost don\u2019t have time to take\n\nin the emotion due to the rush and panic.\n\n\"The police are essentially on their way, it's all so quick, it\u2019s a serious crime so he can\u2019t be out on bail.\n\n\"They both say their individual goodbyes but I don\u2019t think they realise this could be the final time they speak to people, it certainly doesn\u2019t hit Robert until he gets in the car.\"\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Emmerdale's Aaron Dingle actor Danny Miller confessed the tears shed filming Robert Sugden's final scenes were 'real' and 'raw'", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18956238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/19_07_emm_aaron_robert_2nd_ep_03.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
