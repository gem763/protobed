That\u2019ll keep the backbenchers in line.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE The Government's Trying To Pass Their Shitty Welfare Drug Testing Plan Again\n\nShe reiterated her view on Twitter, saying \u201cwhy just pick on poor people?\u201d\n\nIf the Govt is saying that welfare recipients should be drug tested because they are on the public purse then by that logic everyone else being paid by the taxpayer should also be subject to drug testing why just pick on poor people? #auspol \u2014 Jacqui Lambie (@JacquiLambie) September 8, 2019\n\nHer stance isn\u2019t new. Lambie, who has addressed the Senate about her past experiences as a single mother on welfare, has bashed previous attempts to enforce drug tests on Newstart and Youth Allowance recipients without turning the same tests on cashed-up pollies.\n\nThat outcry comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison tries to sell his government\u2019s new welfare agenda. Speaking to The Age on Sunday, he unleashed this choice quote: \u201cBeing on drugs stops you getting a job. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nBut the other prong of the Coalition\u2019s planned welfare shakeup \u2013 their hopes to trial the cashless welfare card on a national basis \u2013 has Lambie\u2019s support.\n\nThat particular plan has faced its own share of opposition. The Greens stand against it, and in July, Australian Council of Social Services CEO Cassandra Goldie said the cashless card system is \u201cgrossly unfair, impractical, demeaning, unproven and expensive.\u201d\n\nThe cashless card system is also yet to win over Labor, with frontbencher Tony Burke yesterday telling Sky News the card will \u201cmake it harder for people to make ends meet.\u201d\n\nThe proposed welfare reforms are set for debate this week.", "description": "The Tassie senator has spoken against the Coalition's plan to drug test welfare recipients.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/lambie-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
