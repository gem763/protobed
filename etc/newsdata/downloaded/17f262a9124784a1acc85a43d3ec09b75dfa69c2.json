Investors are pointing to the company\u2019s CEO Tim Cook and his handling of Chinese relations to explain the firm\u2019s success.\n\nCook has developed a relationship with President Donald Trump and has advocated Apple\u2019s views on tariffs and U.S. manufacturing to the President. Cook has also managed to maintain strong relations with Chinese officials, which has prevented Apple from becoming a target of retaliation following the U.S. government\u2019s move to cut Huawei Technologies Co. out of the American market.\n\nCook was recently named the chairman of a top Chinese business school.\n\nHal Eddins, chief economist for Capital Investment Cos, an Apple shareholder commented on Cook\u2019s performance as CEO stating: \u201cWho would have thought he would have been able to thread that needle and deal with the president? It\u2019s a show of an incredible amount of nuance and emotional intelligence to do what\u2019s best for the company.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s share in the Chinese market fell to 5.2 percent in the third quarter, down from 7 percent a year ago. Chinese firm and Apple competitor Huawei saw its market share jump dramatically from 24.9 percent last year to 42.4 percent this year in the country.\n\nTom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management, another Apple shareholder, stated: \u201cA year ago, we were talking about the price pushback in China, and (Apple) contended they were overcoming that. Now the real question is whether you\u2019re seeing a cultural shift that would bode poorly for Apple.\u201d\n\nBut many Apple investors have likely expected a loss in the Chinese market for some time and are prepared to deal with it in the long term. Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan stated: \u201cIf the industry is worth being in, you should assume that over the course of time it\u2019s going to be dominated by Chinese national champions.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
