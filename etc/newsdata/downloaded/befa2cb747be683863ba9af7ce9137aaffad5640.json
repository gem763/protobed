Police fired a water cannon with blue dye which splashed onto the steps of the city's most prominent mosque, injuring bystanders and some journalists.\n\nAt one point local residents ran screaming down side streets as police fired rounds of tear gas into a crowd of people who were clearly not protesters. Parents with young children ran for cover, an elderly woman was seen throwing up as first aid volunteers rushed to her aid.\n\nDiners stared from the windows of restaurants and hotels, alarmed at the scenes outside. Everywhere, people were coughing and covering their faces.\n\nThese are now familiar scenes as the Hong Kong protests enter their 20th consecutive weekend. But the mood is angrier, the violence more senseless than ever, and there is no end in sight to the five-month long political crisis.\n\nWalking down Nathan Road later that evening towards the Star Ferry, I witnessed a trail of destruction. MTR entrances, traffic lights, bank branches and a chain of snack food stores were trashed. Anti-police and government graffiti was spray-painted on every available surface and most of the shops were closed.", "description": "AFR Correspondent Michael Smith finds a dark and violent mood on the streets of what was once a vibrant Asian financial centre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2627%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_86/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0e7a94a9a110d99d89651ac3f89ee25c3b81557f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
