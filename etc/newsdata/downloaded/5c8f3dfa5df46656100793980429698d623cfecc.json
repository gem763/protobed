BSV is now ranked as the 8th largest coin by market capitalization.\n\nBSV price chart:\n\nAccording to Dovey Wan, a founding partner of California-based investment company Primitive Ventures, the pump started around the same time as fake news began circulating in China, claiming that Craig Wright, one of the main supporters of BSV, proved that he's the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, while major exchange Binance will list BSV again.\n\nThe claims were debunked by Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao himself. \"I got pinged 20 times today, clarifying it is fake,\" he tweeted.\n\nCraig Wright is often dubbed Faketoshi due to his claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto and general lack of any sort of proof. Binance delisted BSV in April 2019.\n\nEarlier in May, BSV also jumped sharply after Craig Wright said he filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office and has been granted U.S. copyright registrations yesterday for the original Bitcoin white paper and Bitcoin code. However, this type of registration does not indicate ownership or official patent.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Wan, \"completely fake news\" were \"real enough\" to trick many Chinese retail investors.\n\nThe trick is easy and constantly used by many scams - all chinese crypto media circulate the breaking news via picture as above in wechat, instead of news link. So anybody can just use the same theme template and photoshop one \u261d\ud83c\udffb like above \u2014 Dovey Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) May 29, 2019\n\n\"Chinese retail is the best herd ever,\" she added.\n\nDue to the crypto exchange ban, local investors are using VPNs (virtual private networks) that help bypass restrictions, while the over-the-counter (OTC) market is another popular option.\n\n\"There are thousands of telegram [a messaging app] users on the Chinese channels of most exchanges as an example,\" a Reddit user claiming to be from China said.\n\nAt pixel time, Asia-based exchanges such us Upbit, OKEx and Huobi are responsible for 48% of the BSV trading volume in the past 24 hours (USD 1,9 billion in total, or almost 10% of the bitcoin trading volume).\n\nAlso, as reported, Chinese crypto investors might prompt another \"epic bull market\" in case of a sudden and sharp yuan depreciation.\n\n\u201cChinese asset holders are not stupid. They see the writing on the wall, and as the CNY has recently crept higher towards the magical 7.00 [yuan per U.S. dollar], Bitcoin exited the doldrums and more than doubled,\u201d according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder & CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX.\n\nMeanwhile, Eric Meltzer, another founding partner of Primitive Ventures, shared his recent experience in China.\n\nBack in Beijing for a few days. My Chinese friends are furiously #stackingsats, the number of people who truly think in terms of Bitcoin and not fiat is growing here bigtime. \u2014 Eric/ \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd95 (@wheatpond) May 29, 2019\n\nWeekly LocalBitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin marketplace, volume (in bitcoin) in China:\n\nSource: coin.dance\n\n____\n\nOther reactions\n\nRemember when #bcash pumped to 0.35 BTC? .... No? Nov 12th, 2017. Remember what happened after that? That's right.. it lost over 90% of its value to #bitcoin. Fraudsters took YOUR Bitcoin. This same coordinated scam is now being executed with $BSV.\n\n\n\nWake the fuck up! \ud83c\udf7b pic.twitter.com/kL21VUzr4z \u2014 A v B (@ArminVanBitcoin) May 30, 2019\n\nThe @binance delisting of BSV has certainly made it easier to manipulate. \u2014 Michael Arrington (@arrington) May 30, 2019\n\n\u62c9\u76d8 means artificially pump the price (usually from the founding team or foundation itsef)\n\n\n\nthat\u2019s why EOS is very popular among Chinese investors as ppl believe with $3B cash in head, no one can pump the price better than EOS (the RAM purchase done by BM is a good example) \u2014 Dovey Wan \ud83d\udddd \ud83e\udd96 (@DoveyWan) May 30, 2019\n\nI'm ashamed to admit I bought this, but very pleased with selling that pump \ud83d\udcb0 \u2014 Quintin Tevyaw (@BlockIChains) May 29, 2019\n\n________", "description": "The recent pump of the Bitcoin SV (BSV) price comes as a reminder of the importance of the Chinese investors in the cryptoverse.
