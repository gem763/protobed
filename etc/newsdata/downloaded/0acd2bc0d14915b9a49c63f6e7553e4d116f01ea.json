Given the extraordinary level of uncertainty and risks facing the economy and public finances, it should not be looking to offer further permanent overall tax giveaways.\n\nIn the case of a No-Deal Brexit, though, it should be implementing carefully targeted and temporary tax cuts and spending increases where it can effectively support the economy.\u2019\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: \u2018September\u2019s spending round supported people\u2019s priorities of health, education and the police within existing fiscal rules.\n\n'Beyond that, the Chancellor has said we will be reviewing the fiscal framework as we turn the page on austerity.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, it emerged yesterday that fears of No Deal were making families tighten their belts, leading to a sharp fall in sales.\n\nTotal retail sales fell by 1.3 per cent in September compared to the same month last year, which is the worst performance for the month since records began in 1995, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.", "description": "The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said UK Government borrowing was set to rise to more than \u00a350billion next year thanks to the Prime Minister's spending pledges.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/01/19419512-0-image-a-83_1570493338625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
