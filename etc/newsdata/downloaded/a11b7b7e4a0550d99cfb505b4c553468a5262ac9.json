Since then, other such isotopes have returned to pre-testing levels \u2014 but not, apparently, chlorine-36.\n\nThe isotope also occurs naturally and is used by scientists to date ice cores, along with beryllium-10. In its standard state, though, chlorine-36 is permanently trapped by the snow in Antarctica, so we shouldn't be finding any readings of it in the atmosphere.\n\n\"There is no more nuclear chlorine-36 in the global atmosphere,\" said geoscientist M\u00e9lanie Baroni, from the European Centre for Research and Teaching in Geosciences and the Environment in France. \"That is ... why we should observe natural chlorine-36 levels everywhere.\"\n\nBy analyzing two specific areas of Antarctica \u2014 one with relatively little annual snowfall, and one with a lot of annual snowfall \u2014 the scientists found that high levels of chlorine-36 are still present near the surface of the ice around the location with little snowfall, the Russian Vostok research station.\n\nA nuclear bomb test at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Wikimedia/US Navy\n\nAs recently as 2008, there were 10 times the natural chlorine-36 levels in the ice around the base, the scientists found. The resulting radioactivity is too small to have any serious impact on Earth's atmosphere, but it seems this isotope is more resilient than anyone thought.\n\nIt's also proving to be more agile than scientists had previously reckoned with, moving up from the depths of the snowpack in the years since 1998. That's another discovery that surprised scientists.\n\nThe findings presented here could shed new insight into how Earth's climate has evolved over millions of years \u2014 we can take some smart guesses at that based on the age of the ice underneath Antarctica, and chlorine-36 is crucial to that dating process.\n\nIf the isotope is behaving in a different way than previously thought, then that has repercussions on how ice cores can be analyzed and dated. It could change some of the history lessons that the ice has taught us down the years.\n\nWhat the research also does is act as a reminder of the long-lasting impact that nuclear weapons can have on the environment, decades after detonation. Indeed, plans are already underway to drill for a 1.5 million-year-old ice core in the region.\n\nThe research has been published in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres.", "description": "Nuclear weapons tests in the 1950s and 1960s released radioactive chlorine into the air.
