After that, the Times writes, the church began grabbing property at an \u201cunprecedented rate,\u201d adding, \u201cthey now own most commercial property on every block within walking distance of the waterfront, putting the secretive church firmly in control of the area\u2019s future.\u201d In fact, 22 of the first 33 buildings on Cleveland Street, considered the downtown district\u2019s main artery, are tied to Scientology.\n\nGetty Images/iStockphoto Much of downtown Clearwater is now owned by people or companies tied to Scientology, a report finds.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Times found a Scientology magazine from the 1990s that listed the church\u2019s goals for the new millennium. Among them was to make \u201cClearwater known as the first Scientology city in the world.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of the properties were quietly bought through limited liability companies, which the Times explains are required to disclose their operators, but not their owners, which is pretty standard in real estate. Many of the properties weren\u2019t on the market when the deals were made And $99 million of the $103 million in real estate deals over the past three years were in cash. Half the sales were for more than double what the properties were valued by the county property appraiser. And the Times found that in six cases, buyers paid quadruple the property\u2019s value.\n\nIn response, the Tampa Bay Times received a letter signed by Scientology attorney Gary Soter that read: \u201cThere is nothing unnatural about Scientologists wanting to live in the same city that houses the international spiritual headquarters of their church. The Church was unaware of the significant number of properties owned by Scientologists in the Clearwater area and are delighted you provided the information.\u201d\n\nGetty Images View of the Church of Scientology Flag campus in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nCouncil members were less delighted by the discovery, however \u2014 especially since many of the lots and storefronts purchased by owners with Scientology ties are sitting vacant while the Clearwater City Council wants to turn the downtown waterfront into a dining and entertainment destination. The Times report describes spaces such as a former jewelry store, an empty Walgreens and a deserted laundromat still sitting empty and unused.\n\n\u201cThe logical conclusion is Scientology must have some sort of a game plan in mind, but they\u2019re not public with what it is,\u201d City Council member Hoyt Hamilton told the paper. \u201cTypically, when people buy commercial real estate, they move forward with construction or redevelopment. That\u2019s not happening with almost any of these properties.\u201d\n\nBut Tal Ezra, a Scientologist who recently bought four land parcels in downtown Clearwater, told the Times that he has plans for an office space and a retail shop. \u201cI saw a business opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one from the church dictates to me what to buy, what to sell, what to do.\u201d\n\nRelated: A supposed Scientology cruise ship is quarantined in St. Lucia over measles", "description": "The church and companies run by its members spent $103 million buying 92 downtown properties in the past three years, the Tampa Bay Times reports.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT783_Scient_ZG_20191022112725.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
