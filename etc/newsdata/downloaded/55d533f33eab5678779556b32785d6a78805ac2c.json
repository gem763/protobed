The Conservatives were leading Labour by a 35-25 margin.\n\nBut these national forecasts often underestimate the SNP's chances because the party's support is concentrated heavily in Scotland.\n\nSeparate seat layout predictions released by the pro-European Best for Britain campaign group showed the SNP probably finishing third.\n\nSimilar outcomes could turn both the SNP and the Lib Dems into power brokers who decide the makeup and direction of the new government.\n\nThe Brexit Party of anti-European populist Nigel Farage stands on the opposite end of the political spectrum and is polling at around 11 percent.\n\nFarage was one of the Brexit campaign's figureheads who won the May European poll within months of forming his new group.\n\nBut his party's impact has been muted by Johnson's own firm pro-Brexit message.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson locked horns on Wednesday with his rivals in a fiery launch to an unpredictable early general election aimed at breaking Britain's protracted Brexit deadlock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5006/d6c30ed6a40b4094abdfda5a2cc2228d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
