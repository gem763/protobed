He will star in the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d film, to be released Sept. 20. He spoke with Marc Myers.\n\nWhen I was 8, a friend of my parents who was an actor came to lodge with us while performing at our local theater. One night, Dad suggested we go pick him up after the show. We arrived a little early and stood in the back of the 300-seat auditorium. There, on stage, was our lodger, with the audience in the palm of his hand. Then came the applause. I was transfixed.\n\nThe next morning at breakfast, I just stared at him. I couldn\u2019t believe that he had such a hold over people just by being in a story. I rather liked this pretending lark.\n\nSoon after, I wrote a 10-minute play. I was the King of Egypt or something. I made the tickets and arranged the seating. My friends from up the road played minor roles. Very minor. My family watched dutifully, bored to death.\n\nHugh Bonneville on his first day at kindergarten in London, in 1967. Photo: Hugh Bonneville\n\nI grew up in the Blackheath section of London. Our two-story Edwardian house felt to me like a vast mansion. It had a semicircular gravel driveway and three stone steps up to the front door, which had a knocker in the shape of a lion\u2019s head. Inside, we had a wood-panel hall and the stairs creaked, but it wasn\u2019t scary.\n\nI\u2019m the youngest of three. My brother, Nigel, was eight years older than me, and my sister, Clare, was six years older. Given the ages of my siblings, I grew up much like an only child.\n\nWe each had our own room. Mine was the smallest and must have been a dressing room. It was next to my parents\u2019 bedroom, which meant I could pop in and nick my father\u2019s hairbrush before school each day.\n\nMy father, John Pritchard, was known as \u201cJP.\u201d He was a urologist who worked at nearby Greenwich Hospital. He met my mother, Pat, at medical school where she was training as a nurse.\n\nWhen I was 10, mum started working three days a week at an office in South London called Century House, a 22-story building. We dropped her off there sometimes.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, long after she had retired, I opened a newspaper to discover that Century House had been the headquarters of MI6, our version of your CIA. When I asked mum if she had been a spy, she said, \u201cNo dear, I did filing.\u201d\n\nShare Your Thoughts Who is your favorite Downton Abbey character?\n\nAfter she passed away, I met someone who had worked with her. He told me their section was involved in collating overnight intercepts and prioritizing them, so the right people saw them. A bit more than filing.\n\nMum was firm but fair. She had this ability to talk people into doing things without them noticing. Before you knew it, you were on the schedule for the church flowers. She was an incredibly selfless person, like my father. Both were community-minded and big on service, duty and charity. They were strict-ish with us, but I had enormous respect for them.\n\nMany actors name someone in school who encouraged their talents. Mine squashed my enthusiasm. In play-reading club, I\u2019d constantly raise my hand only to be batted back by the teacher.\n\nBut I was determined to act. My first play was a Greek tragedy called \u201cThe Bacchae.\u201d The second was a bit part in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar.\u201d\n\nWhen I was 16, I joined the National Youth Theatre, which changed my life. School productions sometimes include students who don\u2019t want to be there. At the NYT, kids from all over the country converged, eager to be involved.\n\nMy big break came when I was 22 and got my Equity card from the British actors union. Until then, I had done plays for fun. Holding that card, I knew I was clutching a passport to a whole new world.\n\nMr. Bonneville and Michelle Dockery on the set of the film \u2018Downton Abbey,\u2019 to be released Sept. 20.

Built in the 1800s, our home was originally a coach house, stables and hay barn that serviced the big house up the hill. As a result, our kitchen has a high ceiling. It\u2019s where the coaches were kept. The adjoining barn, once the hayloft, is now my study.\n\nWhat I love most at night is listening to the sound of the stream that runs past the garden. I am lucky I live in a peaceful place.\n\nHugh\u2019s Views\n\nMr. Bonneville at about age 5, outside his home in the Blackheath district of London.

Some expect me to have a white Labrador. I don\u2019t.\n\nFavorite English dish: Colchester oysters\n\nChildhood trick: Wobbling my chin; it seemed to have an extra muscle.\n\nFavorite aftershave: Jack Piccadilly \u201969, by Richard E. Grant\n\nPrized possession: My grandfather\u2019s ceremonial World War I sword. I will pass it on to my son.", "description": "Despite a schoolteacher who stifled his enthusiasm, the British actor says he was \u2018determined to act.\u2019", "authors": ["Marc Myers"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107454/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
