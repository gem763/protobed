REUTERS/Carlos Osorio\n\nBy Moira Warburton\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got his first day out of the spotlight on Saturday after being hammered for images showing him in blackface, which have threatened to derail his re-election campaign.\n\nTrudeau, 47, was in eastern Canada when pictures first emerged on Wednesday showing him in brown makeup at a 2001 \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party when he was a 29-year-old teacher. He held a hasty press conference on his plane and apologized, ashen-faced, before travelling to other western cities where the scandal dominated questions.\n\nThe revelations were followed by two days of uproar, international ridicule and attacks by the Canadian opposition who called him a hypocrite and demanded he resign. Trudeau apologized repeatedly and begged Canadians for forgiveness, but said he will not step down.\n\nArriving in Toronto on Friday, home to key ethnic ridings that he needs to win, Trudeau attempted to pivot back to policy issues with an assault rifle ban.\n\n\u201cHi Mr. Blackface! Nice to meet you,\u201d one woman said to the prime minister as he strolled in Toronto\u2019s Greektown neighbourhood.\n\nCanadian public reaction to the images has been mixed and it is too early to say whether the scandal will radically shift votes ahead of an Oct. 21 election.\n\nThe Liberals have lost a little ground to rival Conservatives, according to the first surveys conducted after the blackface images emerged and published on Saturday. In recent months, the parties have mostly been locked in a statistical tie.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a KKK sympathizer. It\u2019s not like we discovered youthful anti-Semitic writings,\u201d said Yves Boisvert, a columnist with French-language newspaper La Presse. The story was generally given less prominence by the Quebec media judging by front pages and home pages.\n\nMany Canadians said they were disappointed but not surprised by the images.\n\n\u201cIt is demeaning. The colour of our skin is not a costume prop,\u201d said Samya Hasan, executive director for the Toronto-based Council for Agencies Serving South Asians, adding she was unsurprised because despite Trudeau\u2019s reputation as a vocal progressive, he is still \u201ca privileged white person.\u201d\n\nTrudeau, whose father was the architect of Canada\u2019s multiculturalism system, acknowledged that growing up as the white son of a former prime minister left him with \u201ca massive blind spot.\u201d\n\nPollster David Coletto of Abacus Data said the biggest risk to the Liberals was low voter turnout among their supporters.\n\n\u201cThey were already, in our data, showing that they were less motivated than Conservatives ... there is certainly the chance that this further de-motivates those Liberals and makes them less likely to want to actually cast a ballot,\u201d he said.\n\nBLOW TO CANADA\u2019S BRAND\n\nTrudeau returned to Ottawa on Friday and goes back on the campaign trail on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe down day gives the party, his campaign team and of course himself, the capacity and time to think about what\u2019s gone on and think about ... to what degree they can regain control of their campaign,\u201d said Allan Tupper, a University of British Columbia political science professor.\n\nSeveral Liberal cabinet members came out in support of Trudeau including Harjit Sajjan, Canada\u2019s first Sikh defence minister, who said the photos \u201cdo not represent the person he is now.\u201d Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of the most prominent members of the Liberal cabinet, said she was \u201ctroubled and disappointed\u201d but that she accepted Trudeau\u2019s apology and had full confidence in him as party leader.\n\nTrudeau introduced a gender-balanced cabinet when he took office in 2015 and appointed several minorities to top cabinet positions, including the defence, immigration and natural resources portfolios.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has clashed with Trudeau in the past, said he was \u201csurprised by the number of times\u201d Trudeau had dressed in blackface, while late night comedians excoriated the prime minister.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nFamously declaring that \u201cCanada is back\u201d when he was elected, Trudeau won international plaudits for his focus on feminism, the environment and the need for multilateral organizations.\n\nForeign diplomats have said his stance was important at a time when populism is on the rise and the United States seems intent on shrinking its global ambitions. Canada is bidding for a seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2021.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Ladanna James, a Toronto resident, said of the images. \u201cIt\u2019s a real blow to the Canadian brand.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau got his first day out of the spotlight on Saturday after being hammered for images showing him in blackface, which have threatened to derail his re-election campaign.", "authors": ["Moira Warburton", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190921&t=2&i=1432318408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8K0BE", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
