Through this program, the White House and its private sector partners have committed to providing Americans\u2014from recent high school graduates to those nearing retirement\u2014with a pathway into the skilled workforce of the future, bypassing the traditional four-year college track.\n\nThe current K-12 to college pipeline is failing to prepare students for that workforce, and for many, is instead leaving them saddled with debt that prevents them from accessing the training and skills necessary to change careers or actively participate in\u2014and stimulate\u2014the economy.\n\nAs I recently wrote, \u201cmore than 44 million Americans have student loan debt, meaning about one-sixth of Americans 18 years or older have student loan debt. All told, Americans owe more than $1.5 trillion in student loans.\u201d\n\nThis is a crisis that must be addressed. Instead of proposing one-size-fits-all government-funded band-aid solutions that would bankrupt the economy, we should be cultivating the workforce needed for today\u2014and for tomorrow. America\u2019s future success depends on a workforce pipeline not stuck in the 1950s, but one with its sights set in 2050 and beyond.\n\nWhile the left continues to make pie in the sky promises of free college for all and canceling student loan debt, programs like the Pledge to American Workers Initiative delve into the root of the problem by offering sustainable, actionable solutions\u2014direct training for the jobs employers are seeking to hire for. With millions of open jobs and employers desperately seeking skilled workers, it's encouraging that private companies like Google are jumping at the chance to help.\n\nIn fact, Google has already been putting its money where its mouth is on this issue. Since 2018, over 85,000 students without a college degree have participated in Google\u2019s six-month IT job training program, which is part of the tech giant\u2019s $1 billion initiative to train Americans for technology jobs. Job seekers can earn professional certificates from their online program, Grow with Google, faster than if they attended college. The New York Times reported that Google\u2019s goal \u201cis to allow anyone with an internet connection to become proficient with technology and prepare for a job in areas like information technology support and app development.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a win-win for the individuals that get truly prepared for an in-demand job and for the employers who are able to rapidly expand and fill empty seats with workers who have the necessary knowledge and training.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just companies in the tech sector that are benefitting from investing in workforce training and employment opportunities. Across the country, businesses within the trade sector are ramping up efforts to provide workers with on-the-job training or specialized apprenticeship programs. The trade industry has long recognized this need, but the status quo has been to encourage students to largely ignore these opportunities to earn a paycheck while receiving hands-on education and training in favor of a college diploma. Turns out, even after six years, nearly half of all college students still haven\u2019t received that diploma\u2014but are still wracking up the debt. That\u2019s a major problem.\n\nNow, with the sign-on of Google and other major tech and corporate powerhouses, it looks like the tide is turning in the right direction.\n\nAll of this news shows significant progress, but more still needs to be done. As Congress holds its hearing this week and 2020 candidates examine ways they can offer solutions for our workforce, lawmakers should look at the good work already underway through the Initiative. As more companies follow this path, Americans will have a variety of alternative options to enter high-paying jobs\u2014without having to drown in student loan debt.\n\nWhitney Munro is the vice president of communications at the Foundation for Government Accountability.", "description": "Last week, Google announced its intent to join Apple, IBM, .10/09/2019 14:35:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Whitney Munro", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/154/b077588d-1edf-4fc7-8bc3-6eb88d4a32e0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
