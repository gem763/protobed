I have too much love for Manu, Colin and Pete to do that!\u201d\n\nRELATED: Everything you need to know about the new MasterChef judges\n\nThere have been whispers for months that Channel 7 is keen to sign both Preston and Mehigan but not Calombaris, who earlier this year was fined $200,000 for underpaying staff from his restaurant empire more than $7.8 million in wages.\n\nThe three former MasterChef stars are all contracted to Channel 10 until the end of the year, but they each have a different \u201chold back\u201d agreement with the network that stipulates how long their have to wait before they can sign with other commercial networks in Australia.\n\nAccording to The Herald Sun\u2019s Fiona Byrne, Calombaris\u2019 \u201chold back\u201d clause with Channel 10 is longer than Preston and Mehigan\u2019s. But the \u201chold back\u201d clause doesn\u2019t cover international TV opportunities, which Preston told news.com.au was now their main priority.\n\n\u201cThe feedback we have all received in person on our travels and online from so many of the 20 million fans around the world who loved watching the \u2018three musketeers\u2019 on TV confirms that we\u2019d be mad not to continue making TV together overseas for the international market,\u201d he told news.com.au. \u201cThis is something we all look forward to doing when the time is right.\u201d\n\nSpeculation as to what\u2019s next for Mehigan, Preston and Calombaris has been rife since the trio were sensationally dropped by Channel 10 in July.\n\nA press release announcing the judges would be replaced on MasterChef in 2020 caught everyone off guard, including Preston, who was about to head into Triple M to do a radio interview to promote this year\u2019s MasterChef finale.\n\nHe was in the car outside the radio station when he read on social media that Channel 10 had given him the flick.\n\n\u201cIt would probably have felt worse if I was by myself, but the fact I was with one of the publicists with Ten who had no idea and who was just aghast by the situation, especially about to go and do a national radio show, it was a bit of a shock,\u201d Preston later said on ABC radio.\n\nChannel 10 announced last week that Mehigan, Preston and Calombaris would be replaced on MasterChef next year by Jock Zonfrillo, Melissa Leong and Andy Allen.", "description": "Matt Preston has shot down Aussie TV\u2019s juiciest rumour that he is set to join My Kitchen Rules next year.", "authors": ["Andrew Bucklow"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0f5d2793b4f1b1f763df88061e3f47ed?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
