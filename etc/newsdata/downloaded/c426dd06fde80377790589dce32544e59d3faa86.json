Cointelegraph reported on an unpublished draft of the same report on Oct. 14. The full report reads:\n\n\u201cNo global stablecoin project should begin operation until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks outlined above are adequately addressed, through appropriate designs and by adhering to regulation that is clear and proportional.\u201d\n\nThe task force found that thus far, the first wave of cryptocurrencies has failed to provide a reliable and attractive means of payment or store of value. Stablecoins, on the other hand, are more readily usable as a means of payment and store of value and could potentially develop global payment systems that are faster, cheaper and more inclusive than present systems.\n\nThe report then points to the potential challenges and risks that come with stablecoins for public policy, oversight and regulation, legal certainty, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism compliance and tax compliance, amongst others.\n\nOnce stablecoins are launched globally, the report reads, they could potentially threaten the global financial stability and monetary system.\n\nElsewhere in the G7\n\nThe new report echoes much of what the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) \u2014 itself a G7 initiative \u2014 has pushed for this past summer with its updated anti-money laundering requirements.\n\nNonetheless, the FATF has shown a readiness to approve certain new payment systems entailing cryptocurrencies, including one project from the Japanese government.", "description": "A G7 task force believes that stablecoins could present a significant risk to the global financial stability, but also present an opportunity to update payment...", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9kMWUyMDcwNjhhMzllNjU2YWQyYjQ4Mzk4YTNmODUzOC5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
