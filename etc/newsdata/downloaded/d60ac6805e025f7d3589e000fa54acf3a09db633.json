How can you ask if a person authentically \u201clives and breathes\u201d what she\u2019s presenting when what she\u2019s presenting is herself? That\u2019s literally how a body works. And at the same time, of course she doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s literally how Instagram works.\n\nCoincidentally, this email arrived the same day as a new essay collection by New York fashion and culture writer Natasha Stagg, Sleeveless: Fashion, Image, Media, New York 2011-2019, from Semiotext(e). Stagg is best known for her fashion work\u2014particularly as an editor at V magazine\u2014but Sleeveless also touches on her brief tech career. She remembers working on an app that could \u201crecommend all the ways to become beautiful,\u201d then an app that took \u201cmood selfies.\u201d\n\nThis background makes Stagg uniquely suited to parse the strange stuff we\u2019ve been doing to women lately in the name of giving them more freedom\u2014typically, in actuality, just making them more marketable. (\u201cWomen are so trendy right now,\u201d one woman says to another at the launch of a women-only magazine in Stagg\u2019s essay \u201cNaming Names,\u201d maybe the book\u2019s best and driest punchline.) Most interesting to me, and possibly to the compilers of future influencer authenticity reports, Stagg digs into the question of what a modern \u201cIt Girl\u201d is like.\n\nFor the most part, this It Girl spends her time alone and is seen on Instagram.\u201cI just wish ... that I didn\u2019t have this fear about very young people trying to stay home so that a bigger audience could appreciate a more constructed image,\u201d Stagg writes in the book\u2019s most sprawling essay, \u201cOut of State,\u201d adapted from a recurring column she wrote for Spike magazine. \u201cI know they must be thinking that what their physical high school classmates think of their physical bodies will never matter.\u201d\n\nIn a different era, the It Girl was someone whose photo was taken by onlookers at all the good parties. The new It Girl is someone who takes photos of herself, at home. She spends her time alone and is seen on Instagram, where her \u201cart direction\u201d is what makes her desirable. These young women, Stagg notes, \u201care, more often than not, self-described homebodies, even antisocial. Today, a cool girl is coaxed from a bedroom iPhone shoot into a professional studio.\u201d\n\nShe usually has interesting stuff, like a novelty mirror for outfit-of-the-day photos, a Keanu Reeves throw pillow, a \u201cvintage\u201d MySpace t-shirt, or paintings she made herself. She writes vague, disaffected captions\u2014\u201ctea season,\u201d \u201cyou know how it is,\u201d a black heart emoji. The coolest girl I went to college with has \u201cennui\u201d in her Instagram handle and posts selfies taken in mirrors shaped like waves, with a MacBook or a single red rose in the background; sometimes she\u2019s smoking a cigarette indoors, other times she\u2019s drinking wine out of a coupe glass, typically rolling her eyes. She has amazing hair. Of one such cool girl, named Amina Blue, Stagg observes: \u201cHer image could at once represent her generation\u2019s particular acceptance of overexposure and its acute discomfort with pressure to perform.\u201d", "description": "Loneliness is Instagram\u2019s hottest trend.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_643513934/facebook.jpg?1571235387", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
