In 1965, George Cukor\u2019s sumptuous version of the Broadway smash My Fair Lady won eight Oscars, including best actor for Rex Harrison, who manfully did his own speak-singing as Henry Higgins; eyebrows were raised, however, when his co-star Audrey Hepburn wasn\u2019t even nominated for best actress.\n\nIs Hollywood still in love with the suffering \u2018gay icon\u2019?

Hepburn had been cast in the role in place of its less famous Broadway originator, Julie Andrews; despite extensive vocal training on her part, however, she wasn\u2019t considered a strong enough singer by studio bosses to tackle the lilting likes of I Could Have Danced All Night. Dubbed by the soprano and regular Hollywood ghost-singer Marni Nixon, Hepburn\u2019s otherwise winsome performance was thus deemed a lesser achievement by her peers; in a perfectly ironic twist, best actress that year went to Andrews\u2019 note-perfect film debut in Mary Poppins instead. Perhaps Hepburn, outwardly gracious as ever, called Natalie Wood to vent: three years before, Nixon\u2019s dubbing had also seemingly cost her an Oscar nomination when West Side Story otherwise ran the table.\n\nHalf a century later, the form and fashion of the Hollywood musical has changed considerably, and so has the industry\u2019s attitude toward actors who choose to hide behind others\u2019 vocals: in an age where truly gifted song-and-dance performers are mostly confined to the stage, doing your own singing on screen is seen as an impressive but optional extra talent. Dubbing didn\u2019t cost Rami Malek an Oscar earlier this year, for example: neither the public nor his industry admirers were bothered by the fact that he toothsomely lip-synced in the blockbuster Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in A Star Is Born.

Cooper merely looked on as Malek joined the ranks of actors to win armloads of awards for formidably transforming themselves into major musical figures while skimping on the singing part, including Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf. As the popular music biopic has largely replaced the straight-up musical in Hollywood\u2019s genre affections, physical acting and emoting counts for more than holding a tune, and why should it not?\n\nYet taking the harder route of eschewing dubbing \u2013 and, in particular, interpreting another artist\u2019s immortal vocals \u2013 can yield rewards too. This year, Taron Egerton offered his own tuneful stab at the Elton John songbook in Rocketman; his performance feels more organic and invested than Malek\u2019s swaggering, surface-level Mercury for it. Sissy Spacek and Reese Witherspoon won Oscars for nailing the country-and-western timbre of Loretta Lynn and June Carter Cash, respectively; Spacek\u2019s crooning in Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter, in particular, was so authentic it even netted her a country Grammy nomination. Meanwhile, as a soul music sensation making her film debut in the Billie Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues, you would hardly have expected Diana Ross to go the dubbed route, even if her high, silky voice sounded not a bit like Holiday\u2019s; the gritty spirit of her fine performance was felt, however, and she too was Oscar-nominated.\n\nIt\u2019s into this dedicated but less slavishly impersonation-based tradition that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger\u2019s much-acclaimed performance in Judy falls. Though Zellweger has proven her capable chops in the musicals Chicago and My Own Love Song, she was never going to be a vocal ringer for the utterly singular, from-the-gut stylings of Judy Garland. Yet her decision to do her own singing pays off handsomely, not least because the film, set in the bumpy final year of Garland\u2019s life, captures the showwoman at her most vocally damaged and erratic. Having Zellweger lip-sync to pristine Garland recordings would have been entirely inaccurate; digging up archive footage of Garland at her worst for Zellweger to mime to, on the other hand, would have been simply ghoulish.\n\nAs it is, Zellweger\u2019s tour de force proves how \u2013 even as it comes at the expense of pure, eerie verisimilitude \u2013 having an actor literally find the voice of the person they\u2019re playing can contribute invaluably to the very arc of a performance. She matches Garland\u2019s tattered, liquor-soaked vocal stumbles early on, playing well beneath either woman\u2019s ability; by the time she reaches crisper, clearer notes, for a climactically redemptive onstage rendition of Over the Rainbow, the anxiety and labour that is audible in her voice feels so hard-earned, it hardly matters that she\u2019s not reaching Garland\u2019s highest peaks. The triumph belongs to the actor and character alike; with respect to the most lauded of lip-syncers, that\u2019s not a victory they know.", "description": "As Judy Garland, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger delivers an all-singing tour de force and reminds us of the power of stars who can also sing their way through musicals", "authors": ["Guy Lodge"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e05fd230c77229f2f9ae3fb57d30850cef632f2/0_392_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=be62cc315d664541fd6a4e371117bf68", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
