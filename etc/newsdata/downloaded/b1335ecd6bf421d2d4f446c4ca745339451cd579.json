And in another spot of good news, the results across the board weren't too bleak. Read more\n\nNBN 50 plans are a safe bet if you don\u2019t know what NBN speed to go for; they tend to be the sweet spot when it comes to speed and value. An NBN 50 plan will be a significant step up from an ADSL connection, but not quite as pricey as an NBN 100 plan.\n\nBut if you have the need for speed, there are cheaper NBN 100 options available thanks to promotional discounts. While these all tend to be time-based offers where you\u2019ll only save for the first six months of your contract, a discount is still a discount.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of the cheapest NBN 100 plans and NBN 50 plans around with unlimited data.\n\nSome of the cheapest unlimited NBN 100 plans\n\nVodafone has one of the cheapest NBN 100 plans around right now, thanks to a discount. You'll pay $69 per month for your first six months, and then $89 per month thereafter.\n\nWhile Vodafone's NBN plans are technically contract-free, you will have to pay out a modem fee if you leave within your first 36 months. This works out to be $180, minus $5 for each month you've been connected. Vodafone reports evening speeds of 85Mbps on NBN 100 plans.\n\nIf you're already a Vodafone mobile customer, you can save between 5% and 20% on a Vodafone NBN plan by bundling it with your existing service. This discount increases based on how many active services you have.\n\nTangerine is also worth considering, with another promotional discount. You\u2019ll pay $79.90 per month for your first six months, and then $89.90 per month thereafter. Tangerine reports typical evening speeds of 83Mbps and its plans are all contract-free and have no early exit fees. Better yet, Tangerine offers a 14-day risk-free trial. If you\u2019re not happy with your NBN service during your first 14 days, Tangerine will provide a full refund of your plan fees and any modem charges.\n\nMyRepublic has its own NBN 100 offer, but this one runs for a year. You'll pay $79.95 for your six months, and then $89.95 per month thereafter. You will have to commit to a year-long contract, however. MyRepublic reports typical evening speeds of 83Mbps for its NBN 100 plans.\n\nIf you\u2019re after one of the fastest NBN plans around, it\u2019s worth considering Superloop. $89.95 per month will get you an unlimited NBN 100 plan with typical evening speeds of 90Mbps.
