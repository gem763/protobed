Of those 13,000 children currently waiting, more than a quarter are under 5 and at least 400 are infants.\n\nChildren aren\u2019t being sent back alone. The policy, officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, isn\u2019t supposed to apply to unaccompanied minors \u2014 they\u2019re typically allowed to pursue their cases from within the U.S. \u2014 but it does apply to family groups. Administration officials have repeatedly said the program is partly intended to keep asylum-seeking families from reaching the U.S., since a federal court settlement forbids the government from detaining minors for over 20 days.\n\nThere\u2019s been a surge in migrant families claiming asylum at the border over the past year. Many are fleeing violence, crime, and poverty in Central America, and a growing number are so-called \u201cextra-continental\u201d migrants from Africa and Asia who are similarly seeking better conditions in the U.S. Border officers apprehended more than 457,000 people in \u201cfamily units\u201d between October 2018 and August 2019, according to federal data.\n\nNow, under the \u201cRemain\u201d program, which started in January, instead of waiting out their cases in the U.S., tens of thousands of migrant families have been forced to live in cities along the Mexican border, many of which have high rates of violence. The luckiest families are those who can afford to rent apartments or find open beds in shelters run by nonprofits and religious organizations.\n\nBut thousands of others are living in tent cities. Reuters spoke with one Guatemalan woman who lives in a small encampment in the back of a church outside Tijuana, who said her children \u2014 and others living there \u2014 often get sick because of the crowded conditions.\n\nAnd they migrants are protesting these conditions. About 250-300 asylum-seekers, including some children, shut down the bridge uniting the Mexican city of Matamoros and Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday in protest of the Remain in Mexico policy. The protesters occupied the bridge overnight and shut down traffic for several hours. Children in the crowd made their voices heard, chanting, \u201cWe want to study, we want to study!\u201d according to the ACLU\u2019s Rochelle Garza.\n\nCover: A Honduran girl, center, is hugged by friends as she leaves the Agape World Mission shelter after her family decided to abandon their asylum case and accept voluntary return to Honduras, after spending nearly six months at the border, in Tijuana, Mexico, Thursday, Sept. 12, 2019. A new level of despair spread among tens of thousands of migrants waiting on the Mexican border to seek refuge in the U.S. as the Trump administration began enforcing radical new restrictions Thursday on who qualifies for asylum.
