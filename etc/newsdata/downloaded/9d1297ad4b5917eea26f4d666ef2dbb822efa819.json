The benchmark index closed about 1.4% shy of its record high hit in late-July.\n\nBeijing said on Thursday it was in close communication with the United States and was preparing to make progress with their trade talks in October.\n\n\"We need something like a trade deal to get through. Without that we are just going to bounce around here where you if get some bad political news, it sells off,\" said Kim Forrest, Chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Late in the day yesterday President Trump said we could get a trade deal with China and that's always a formula for markets going up and we might have some overhang from that.\"\n\nForrest also noted that fitness startup Peloton Interactive Inc's top-end priced IPO could add some \"pep\" to markets.\n\nTrade-sensitive chipmakers rose in premarket trading, with Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Micron Technology Inc and Nvidia Corp up between 0.2% and 0.7%.

S&P 500 e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.13% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 3.75 points, or 0.05%.\n\nConagra rose 3.8% after the packaged food maker beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, boosted by last year's purchase of Pinnacle Foods and strong demand for its frozen food brands.\n\nFacebook Inc slipped 1.0% as a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the U.S. Justice Department will open an antitrust investigation of the social media company.\n\nLeisure cruise operator Carnival Corp dropped 2.9% before the release of its quarterly results.\n\nAccenture plc fell 1.3% after the consulting and outsourcing service provider forecast first-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates.\n\nFutures were little moved after data showed the final reading of U.S. economic growth for the second quarter remained unchanged from initial estimates, while unemployment claims rose slightly last week.
