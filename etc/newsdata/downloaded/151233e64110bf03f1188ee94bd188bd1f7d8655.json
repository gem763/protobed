The deracialisation of education;\n\n. The integration of former homeland department\u2019s education into one South African education system;\n\n. The multiple reviews of curricula in order to align it with the policy positions of the new government, and current Constitutional norms and principles;\n\n. The review of the role of school inspectors;\n\n. The abolition of corporal punishment;\n\n. The tension between teacher unionism and professionalism; and\n\n. The introduction of new technology such as iPads and social media.\n\nGiven the rapidity of these changes, it is not clear to me how the departments of basic and higher education have prepared programmes to prepare and empower teachers to cope with these changes.\n\nLike Professor Sehoole, I find it difficult to see how robots can replace disciplined, dedicated and competent teachers in the classroom.\n\nRobots will not be able to make on-the-spot judgments about the needs of children from less privileged backgrounds.\n\nThey may not be able to deal with bullies on the school grounds. They will not be able to appreciate emotional baggage that boys and girls bring into the classroom.\n\nNeither can they make judgements about how to manage spontaneous school protests nor comprehend social circumstances that inhibit the completion of homework.\n\nThe country is currently faced with a breakdown of discipline in schools that is characterised by pupils stabbing each other, and school girls being impregnated by teachers.\n\nThese are not matters that robots can deal with.\n\nI do not think, however, we should lull teachers into complacency.\n\nGiven the proliferation of technological changes in society, we should ask how teachers have been assisted to engage and cope with change.\n\nWhat we should prioritise are change management programmes in education to prepare teachers for the inevitability of technological change.\n\nWe should analyse and understand the implications of the fourth industrial revolution in the classroom, and prepare teachers accordingly to engage technology and enhance teaching and learning.\n\nWe should consider questions like: How can teachers be empowered to instruct robots to set up science laboratories?\n\nCan they assist teachers to mark multiple questions exams? Can they assist with the computation of test marks?\n\nCan they play a role in preparing school reports? Can social media be harnessed to play videos that can facilitate and reinforce learning in the classroom?\n\nIt is clear that we cannot wish away technological advances.\n\nWhat we can do is conceive programmes to prepare our teachers, and empower them to use modern technology to enhance and support their roles in the classroom.\n\nThis is critical because the current cohort of learners will be in a global competition with children from other societies who have been prepared for these changes.\n\nWe should therefore not waste a moment to ensure South Africa becomes globally competitive, and this begins in the classroom.\n\n\u2022 Dr Khotso de Wee writes in his capacity as a life-long student of education, and a citizen of the republic.", "description": "This is a response to Professor Chika Sehoole\u2019s article on why teachers can never be replaced.", "authors": ["Dr Khotso De Wee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9458/a6771970afd1481f9082bae81e232133.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
