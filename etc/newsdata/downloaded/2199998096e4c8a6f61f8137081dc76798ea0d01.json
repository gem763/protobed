But the agreement he's struck with the European Union would erect significant trade barriers for companies operating in the United Kingdom, reduce growth and leave the country poorer.\n\nThe deal must still be approved by the UK parliament, which will convene Saturday for a special session.

Her agreement would have kept the United Kingdom in close alignment the European Union, despite it leaving the bloc's unified market and customs union. Johnson has abandoned that goal, and instead wants Britain to have more control over its regulations and global trade policy at the expense of easy access to the EU market of about 450 million people.\n\n\"Flexibility comes at a cost,\" said Jonathan Portes, a professor at King's College, London, and senior fellow at UK in a Changing Europe, a think tank. \"The fact is, economically, there is no doubt that the gains from being in the EU customs union outweigh any potential free trade deals with another country.\"\n\nWhile Johnson's deal would be better for the economy than crashing out of the European Union without arrangements to protect trade, Britain faces a future where many of the benefits of decades of integration with the European Union are unwound.

About 46% of UK exports are shipped to EU markets.\n\nRead More", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has secured a \"great new deal\" on Brexit.
