But his supporters are perfectly willing to sweep up the pieces and write off his not-so-infrequent missteps.\n\nThe former vice president has been a candidate for the highest office in the land\u2014officially or unofficially\u2014for all of my adult life. His affable, self-deprecating style is an attractive lure for voters who see him as the kind of candidate they\u2019d most like to have over for Sunday dinner.\n\nBiden is equally at ease on a crowded Acela Express commuter train, in an Iowa cornfield, or the pulpit of a black church. While some politicos might have difficulty finding their footing, the former senator from Delaware can hum with the Methodists and holler with the Baptists.", "description": "Mystified as to why Joe Biden keeps malapropping it up but never drops in the polls?
