Gabbard argued that the process has not been transparent.\n\n\u201cI thought it should be a transparent process, but I long expressed my concern about going through impeachment proceedings in a very, very partisan way because it will only further tear apart an already divided country,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE\n\nOn the \"Sean Hannity Show,\" Gabbard said \"it must be done transparently. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in those closed doors. We as members of Congress do not have access to the information that\u2019s being shared. I think the American people deserve to know exactly what the facts are, what evidence is being presented as this inquiry goes on.\"\n\nIn late September, Gabbard was the last Democrat to announce her support of the inquiry.\n\n\u201cSo it is unfortunate, but necessary, that I speak in support of the inquiry into the President\u2019s alleged abuse of power in relation to his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leaders. This inquiry must be swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused. It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy,\u201d Gabbard said in the Sept. 27 press release.\n\nGabbard has not yet qualified for the next Democratic presidential debate set to take place in Georgia on Nov. 20.", "description": "In a new video released after midnight on Thursday and an email to her supporters, Rep.
