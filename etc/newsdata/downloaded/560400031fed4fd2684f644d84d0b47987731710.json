We cannot rely on what has happened before, thinking that will be enough, because it won't be.\"", "description": "England scrumhalf Ben Youngs believes the team will have to rely on more than their recent record against Australia if they are to avoid a defeat.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7926/57bb3d1defed468d838ed0b35d6f1518.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
