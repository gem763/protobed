And players from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Cuba and Puerto Rico make up more than 20 percent of current big-league rosters, according to Major League Baseball (MLB).\n\nSalcedo eats an arepa for breakfast at his home in Maracaibo.

They went on to beat Australia and Mexico before crashing out of the World Series with a loss to Cura\u00e7ao.\n\nLittle Leaguer Santiago Lopez, 10, practices during an electricity cut at his house in Maracaibo.
