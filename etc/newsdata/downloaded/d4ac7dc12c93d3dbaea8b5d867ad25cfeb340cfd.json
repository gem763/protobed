Many are considering early retirement.\n\n\"Patients already face overly long waits for operations.\n\n\"Persisting with a tax system that punishes clinicians for taking on extra work will undoubtedly lead to a further deterioration in waiting times.\"\n\nRCS council member Stella Vig, a clinical director at Croydon University Hospital, added: \"The NHS pensions scheme has created a 'tax trap', where accepting an extra shift can lead to a large and entirely unpredictable tax bill landing in the post many months later.\n\n\"The Government has published a consultation that looks set to last many more months, rather than taking decisive action. We need them to sort this out before winter takes hold.\"\n\nOne surgeon said their waiting list had risen from five months to nine months overnight, after they dropped one session a week, in a bid to protect their earnings.", "description": "Patients will face longer waits for operations this winter as surgeons refuse to work overtime because of a pensions \u201ctax trap,\u201d senior doctors have warned.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Telegraph View", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/200482429_PA_NHS-waiting-times-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqcyBDAtXyyWlu10n0nnKeArUWgWFvoUlu009OBPfCoKY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
