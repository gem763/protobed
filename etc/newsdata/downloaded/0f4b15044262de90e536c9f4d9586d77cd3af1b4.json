Other states celebrate Columbus Day, but have also symbolically recognised Indigenous Peoples' Day either on the same day or another one.\n\nSince 1992, Native American advocates have pressed states to change Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples' Day over concerns that Columbus helped launched centuries of genocide against indigenous populations in the Americas.\n\nNew Mexico is marking its statewide Indigenous Peoples' Day with an invocation by several tribal leaders in unison in their native languages. There also will be a parade and traditional dances at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center in Albuquerque.\n\n\"I think it's great and it's about time,\" said All Pueblo Council of Governors Chairman E Paul Torres, a member of Isleta Pueblo in New Mexico.\n\nDemocratic New Mexico state Representative Derrick Lente of Sandia Pueblo, the sponsor of his state's legislation that changed the holiday to Indigenous Peoples' Day, said the day allows reflection on the United States's complicated history.\n\nAdopting the holiday, he said, provides some restorative justice for indigenous communities.\n\nA woman holds a sign for Indigenous Peoples Day during a demonstration and march in Seattle, Washington [File: Elaine Thompson/AP Photo]\n\nState offices in Maine also are scheduled to close for the holiday. Maine, home to four federally recognised tribes, ditched Columbus Day in favour of Indigenous Peoples' Day with an April bill signing by Democratic Governor Janet Mills.\n\n191012190309098\n\nShe said at the time she hoped the move would represent a move \"toward healing, toward inclusiveness\". Tribes in Maine have had a rocky relationship with the state government over the years, and the Penobscot and Passamaquoddy tribes withdrew representatives to the Legislature in 2015, when Republican Governor Paul LePage was in office.\n\nOnline, many shared photos of celebrations and commemorations across the US.\n\n\"I'm indigenous 365 days a year but we'll let today be extra special,\" tweeted one Twitter user.\n\nI'm indigenous 365 days a year but we'll let today be extra special \u2665\ufe0f #IndigenousPeoplesDay #ColumbusWho? pic.twitter.com/gmN8aG6I6V \u2014 kam\ud83e\uddf8 (@kamgleason) October 14, 2019\n\nAnother Twitter user said: \"I'm proud everyday to be Native but today, we actually get some recognition for overcoming such tragedies that were done to our people throughout history. American history! #educateyourself #IndigenousPeoplesDay.\n\nI'm proud everyday to be Native but today, we actually get some recognition for overcoming such tragedies that were done to our people throughout history.

As Indigenous people of an occupied land, they expect and demand the recognition and respect of those who occupy it \u2013 and an understanding of important issues in Indian Country.

It needs to be about the willingness to work with the Indigenous people of the land you occupy, involving them directly in everything. Without that, words fall short.\"", "description": "Several US states and cities have done away with Columbus Day celebrations in deference to Native Americans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/b33a277fcb05443487c55dac9b96f4a8_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
