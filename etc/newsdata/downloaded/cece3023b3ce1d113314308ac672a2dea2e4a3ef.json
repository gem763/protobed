The suspect, who apparently did not know Magill, was charged with first-degree murder while armed on Wednesday. Authorities say it was a random attack, not a sexual assault or robbery. She died on the sidewalk.\n\nWitnesses described the horrifying scene for Pat Collins and Gina Cook:\n\n\"I heard a scream and then a 'Oh no!' and then another scream,\" nearby resident Chris Chambers told News4. \"Came downstairs and came out with my wife and all we saw was a dog across the street with a leash and no human and we knew something was wrong,\" he said. \"We looked down and we found the young lady on the sidewalk in front of our house bleeding.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely tragic. I still can't wrap my head around it,\" Magill's sister, Raeann Magill, told the local station.\n\n\"You know, out walking a dog and to be attacked like that. How can anyone even fathom that? I mean, it's truly tragic and I even think to myself, why her?\" she added.\n\nMagill graduated from the University of California, Davis, in 2015 and was working for a non-profit in D.C.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, there have been 113 homicides in DC so far in 2019. 19 of these have been from stabbings.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:23:59AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/204/33c068de-3a09-4e52-9fde-d5933e473fde.jpg"}
