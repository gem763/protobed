Apparently, the bird had been surviving on various food items like tacos, pork rinds and even dog food.\n\nLIBRARY BOOK RETURNED WITH FULL TACO SHOVED BETWEEN ITS PAGES\n\nThe post states, \u201cAfter a rough weekend, it's good to see a gamecock story with a happy ending. Deputies from our Patrol Division and Animal Control Unit responded late last week to the Taco Bell on Highway 78 in Ladson for a report of a rowdy rooster causing a ruckus. He had been loitering for a week and chowing down on tacos, pork rinds and dog food whenever he felt a bit peckish.\u201d\n\nFortunately, authorities were able to corral the animal, with a little bit of help. \u201cPatrol deputies came, and Animal Control provided backup with a net,\u201d the post continues. \u201cTogether, they corralled the rather large rooster. He was transported to the Charleston Animal Society without further incident.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe post concludes with a joke, saying, \u201cSo now we know why the chicken crossed the road: to get to Taco Bell. ... And thanks to these deputies, this rooster will live mas.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaybe the rooster was just upset about Taco Bell\u2019s recent decision to discontinue the Cool Ranch Doritos Taco (along with several other menu items).", "description": "It isn\u2019t just Chihuahuas that \u201cquieren\u201d Taco Bell.", "authors": ["Michael Hollan"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/taco-bell-rooster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
