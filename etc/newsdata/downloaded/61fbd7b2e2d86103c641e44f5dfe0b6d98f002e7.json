He wants the public to call off the Democrats.\n\nIf the public gets confused and can\u2019t keep track of his corruption, he expects polls to tell Democrats that most Americans are dismissing the whole thing as just more political fighting.\n\nSo, here is a primer for Democrats who want to keep their eyes on the prize.\n\nWe begin with one fact:\n\nThe President of the United States withheld military aid to Ukraine while asking the country\u2019s new president to open a corruption investigation into Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report Trump praises Woodward, slams other journalists over 'Face the Nation' segment Why Elizabeth Warren will fail to shine in her moment on the trail MORE\u2019s son.\n\nYes, Trump put the nation\u2019s military security concerns behind his personal political goal of damaging Biden, an opponent who consistently beats him in 2020 presidential polls.\n\nLast week, in a brazen effort to make his corruption look normal, the president openly called for another nation \u2014 China \u2014 to also launch a corruption probe into Biden.\n\nThese facts are not in dispute. The president released a summary memo of his phone call with the Ukrainian president that confirms the facts.\n\nThere are also memos and messages among U.S. diplomats that confirm the facts.\n\nBut to get everyone to look the other way, Trump is putting on a dazzling cable news show full of shouted insults and pained claims that he is a victim of Democrats who want to undo the 2016 election. He complains Democrats are conducting a coup. He says they are guilty of treason. He warns of civil war.\n\nOh, he is also using profanity on Twitter. He distracts by bullying Rep. Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSE Cupp: How much longer will allies excuse Trump's behavior? Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy Attorney says he's representing second Trump whistleblower from intel community MORE (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, with the nickname \u201cShifty Schiff.\u201d He also gets snickers by being crude and saying Schiff could not hold his secretary of State\u2019s jockstrap.\n\nHis friends in the right-wing echo chamber are daring Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiPelosi-backed group funding ads for vulnerable Democrats amid impeachment inquiry Trump to hold Louisiana rally for GOP candidates in governor's race Graham vows to publicly question whistleblowers if Trump is impeached MORE (D-Calif.) to hold a formal vote on starting impeachment \u2014 even though it is not required by the Constitution. They want to drag Pelosi into a time-consuming exercise that does not advance actual impeachment. It will give Trump more time to cover-up and stonewall.\n\nBy the way, Pelosi has the votes if she felt such a vote would make a difference to actually impeaching Trump. It does not.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is just one more distraction from the fact, as affirmed last week by Ellen Weintraub, chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, that it is illegal to ask a foreign government for help in an American political campaign.\n\nFox News\u2019 Andrew Napolitano Andrew Peter NapolitanoThe Memo: Trump's rage may backfire on impeachment Fox News legal analyst: Trump's Ukraine call 'manifested both criminal and impeachable behavior' Tucker Carlson mocks Shep Smith after he defends Fox News legal analyst MORE put it plainly last week:\n\n\u201cIs violating campaign finance law by involving a foreign government in an American presidential campaign an impeachable offense? Yes, it is,\u201d Napolitano wrote on FoxNews.com. \u201cThe expressed intention of those who wrote the Constitution and those who wrote the campaign finance laws 200 years later \u2014 and the lesson of the post-2016 election and Mueller-investigated angst in America \u2014 was to keep foreign governments out of the American political system.\u201d\n\nAn open and shut case, right?\n\nA USA Today/Ipsos poll from last week shows growing support for the House impeaching Trump over his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.\n\n\u201cAmericans by a 45%-38% plurality now support a vote by the House of Representatives to impeach,\u201d according to USA Today. The poll also found that 44 percent say the Senate \u201cshould convict Trump and remove him from office.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the effort to distract goes on. You can watch it live every time Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiTrump associates pressured Ukraine over gas firm in order to benefit allies: report House GOP Intel member: 'Why should I care about' another Trump whistleblower Trump's tirades, taunts and threats are damaging our democracy MORE goes on television and delivers a rambling, bizarre conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cWe know corrupt Ukrainian oligarch laundered $3 million to the Biden Family,\u201d Giuliani tweeted last month.\n\nThere is no such proof. Referring to several component parts of the effort to smear Biden, the Washington Post recently wrote they \u201cfact-checked these allegations in May and found they did not add up.\u201d\n\nDemocrats also have to be careful not to distract themselves by responding to calls from their supporters to load up the articles of impeachment with every grievance against Trump for the last four years \u2013 contact with Russians, obstruction of the Mueller probe, foreign leaders staying at Trump hotels to gain his favor \u2014 as legitimate and important as that might be.\n\nWe must all keep our eyes on the prize if the country is to survive Trump.\n\nJuan Williams is an author, and a political analyst for Fox News Channel.", "description": "OPINION: The president and his allies will try to distract so Democrats need to keep their focus.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_100419as4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
