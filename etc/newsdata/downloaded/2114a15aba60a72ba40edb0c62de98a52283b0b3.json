It\u2019s the drink that has launched a thousand arguments.\n\nI cannot think of another cocktail that has had as much ink spilled (and perhaps blood) concerning the proper recipe, correct preparation and, even, appropriate garnish. And that\u2019s not to mention theories as to who invented the drink or named it\u2014don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going there, not now, anyway.\n\nIt seems that I have a kindred spirit in recognizing the divisiveness of the Martini. In his entertaining and engaging new book, The Martini Cocktail: A Meditation on the World\u2019s Greatest Drink, with Recipes, Robert Simonson deftly observes that the cocktail consists of \u201cgin, vermouth, sometimes bitters, lemon twist or olive, and lots of opinions. Those are the ingredients of a Martini. But the last item is the most important. It\u2019s the one that keeps us talking about a drink that is nearly 150 years old. Something about the Martini gets people worked up, certain that the world might have a fighting chance at decency if only people would adhere to their particular recipe.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been a devotee of the properly made Dry Martini for more than a quarter of a century, and over that expanse of time I\u2019ve observed and enjoyed the range of opinions that surround what social critic Bernard DeVoto called \u201cthe supreme American gift to world culture,\u201d and what H.L. Mencken referred to as \u201cthe only American invention as perfect as a sonnet.\u201d\n\nHere are a few of my all-time favorite Martini arguments:\n\nOpinion Battleground No. 1: Shaken or Stirred?\n\nWe\u2019re all so familiar with Ian Fleming\u2019s direction that James Bond\u2019s Martini be \u201cshaken, not stirred\u201d that it\u2019s become somewhat clich\u00e9, and one might even assume that it was Fleming himself who created this method. He did not.\n\nIf you consult Harry Johnson\u2019s Bartenders Manual from 1900 you\u2019ll find that the shaken gin Martini goes by the name of Bradford \u00c0 La Martini. But as Simonson points out, Robert Vermiere states in his 1922 book Cocktails and How to Mix Them, that \u201cthe Martini Cocktail should be prepared in the mixing glass and stirred up. In America, however, it has been the fashion, since a few years, to shake this cocktail until thoroughly cold.\u201d This disagreement on preparation is not unusual given how common the basic Martini formula was at the turn-of-the-century.\n\nIndeed, four years later, in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s 1926 classic A Farewell to Arms, Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes enjoy their Martinis shaken while sitting at the Palace Hotel\u2019s bar in Madrid. \u201cWe sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickeled shaker.\u201d And in the classic 1934 film The Thin Man, Nick Charles advises that in making drinks, \u201cthe important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a Manhattan you shake to foxtrot time, a Bronx a two-step time, but a Dry Martini you always shake to waltz time.\u201d Got that?\n\nMe, personally I\u2019m a stirrer, not a shaker, but when I\u2019m out at a restaurant and I have the notion that they\u2019re capable of making a decent (albeit shaken) Martini, I\u2019ll let them shake it. I feel like I\u2019m already being fussy enough requesting what gin to use, the ratio of gin to vermouth, how many olives...etc. If I say \u201coh, and please stir it,\u201d I\u2019m guessing they won\u2019t stir it nearly long enough, nor with enough ice. I figure you have to pick your Martini battles.\n\nIn his 1948 classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, the uber-opinionated David Embury asserted that:\n\n\u201cThe real distinction between the two methods is simple. Shaking produces a colder cocktail quicker than stirring. Therefore, since frigidity is highly desirable in all cocktails, shaking is normally the preferable method. However, with some cocktails another consideration enters into the picture, and that is \u2018eye appeal.\u2019 A substantial part of the charm of certain cocktails, such as the Martini and the Manhattan is their clear, almost scintillating translucence. A stirred cocktail will remain clear; a shaken cocktail will be cloudy or even muddy in appearance. This result is particularly noticeable where vermouth or any other wine is an ingredient. Therefore, you should never shake a cocktail containing any wine unless you want a muddy-looking drink. The cloudiness will clear somewhat as the drink stands, but it will never have quite the limpid appeal of the drink that is stirred. Some people care more for the stinging cold of the shaken cocktail than they do for its appearance. So, if you do not mind a muddy-looking drink, shake to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\n\nWhether or not you agree with Fleming about shaking versus stirring, you\u2019ve got to hand it to him for offering us another memorable Martini scene, this time having to do with how to properly garnish the drink. In his 1961 James Bond novel Thunderball, Bond\u2019s CIA colleague Felix Leiter berates a bartender for various crimes against the Martini. In particular, Leiter was annoyed that the jumbo olive\u2019s displacement rendered his drink only half its normal size.\n\n\u201cThe Martinis arrived. Leiter took one look at them and told the waiter to send over the barman. When the barman came, looking resentful, Leiter said, \u2018My friend, I asked for a Martini and not a soused olive.\u2019 He picked the olive out of the glass with the cocktail stick. The glass, that had been three-quarters full, was now half full.\u201d Lesson learned from Mr. Fleming, specify your garnish, and ask for it on the side!\n\nOpinion Battleground No. 2: The Right Ratio\n\nThe ratio of gin to vermouth is another touchy subject. In his 1950 novel Across the River and Into the Trees, Hemingway offered his own ratio as 15 to 1, and he called this version of the drink the Montgomery. It was named for British General Bernard \u201cMonty\u201d Montgomery who, in Hemingway\u2019s opinion, was too cautious in battle, requiring a 15-to-1 troop superiority before committing his army into battle. \u201cMonty was a character who needed fifteen to one to move, and then moved tardily,\u201d Hemingway\u2019s protagonist explained\n\nDeVoto shared in his classic 1948 book The Hour, his own personal recipe, which is so complicated it\u2019s hard to believe he actually used it. At the\u201cpoint at which the marriage of gin and vermouth is consummated,\u201d one required \u201ca gin of 94.4 proof and a harmonious vermouth,\u201d at a ratio of \u201cabout 3.7 to one. And that is not only the proper proportion but a critical one; if you use less gin it is a marriage in name only and the name is not Martini. You get a drinkable and even pleasurable result, but not art\u2019s sunburst of imagined delight becoming real.\u201d\n\nWhen Embury got wind of DeVoto\u2019s opinions on ratio, he was slightly less than diplomatic. While expounding on the topic of the Martini, he noted that \u201cso much of what has been written is pure hooey and balderdash that I cannot refrain from popping off about some of it.\u201d And pop off he did; indeed, in a later edition of The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, he even took a few shots at DeVoto, himself. \u201cThis gentleman is a facile and highly interesting writer and, except as to gin, rum, and whisky, I have found many of his comments on drinks and drink mixing thoroughly sound. But, when it comes to the Martini, phooey!\u201d\n\nLike I said, if war is the mother of invention, the Martini is the mother of opinions.\n\nI should note that DeVoto was very opinionated on topics beyond the Martini. Indeed, in his view. \u201cThere are only two cocktails. One can be described straightforwardly. It is a slug of whiskey and it is an honest drink.\u201d\n\nOf course, the only other cocktail in DeVoto\u2019s mind was the Martini. He was quick to acknowledge that it is a battleground for opinions; yet while the art of Martini making was \u201ca fine and noble art,\u201d DeVoto cautioned that it has too often led to \u201cwars over the gospel that have parted brothers, wrecked marriages, and made enemies of friends.\u201d I\u2019m not suggesting that DeVoto and Embury were friends, mind you.\n\nAs for Hemingway\u2019s opinion on how the drink was to be properly made, in addition to the 15-to-1 ratio, he also wanted it to be damned cold, and bragged that he\u2019d \u201cfound a way of making ice in the deep-freeze in tennis ball tubes that comes out 15 degrees below zero\u201d helping to make \u201cthe coldest Martini in the world.\u201d No doubt he needed this because he was drinking them in hot and humid Cuba. In a 1947 letter to his ex-wife Pauline, he noted that this method of making ice \u201cgives a pillar of ice 15 degrees below zero F. and now have glasses frozen and Spanish cocktail onions frozen. Whole drink comes out so cold you can\u2019t hold it in your hand. It sticks to the fingers.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the pre-made Martini? In DeVoto\u2019s view, \u201cthe man who mixes his Martinis beforehand and keeps them in the refrigerator until cocktail time\u201d was the worst kind of sinner. \u201cYou can no more keep a martini in the refrigerator than you can keep a kiss there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proper union of gin and vermouth is a great and sudden glory; it is one of the happiest marriages on earth and one of the shortest-lived,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe fragile tie of ecstasy is broken in a few minutes, and thereafter there can be no remarriage.\u201d\n\nOne aspect of Simonson\u2019s book that I found particularly heartening was his prologue, titled \u201cMy Dad\u2019s Martini.\u201d The cocktail was his father\u2019s drink of choice, as it is my own father\u2019s. As for the senior Simonson, he liked them on the rocks, and \u201che insisted on a few particulars.\u201d Indeed, his Martini \u201calways included a fair measure of vermouth,\u201d since \u201che liked the flavor of vermouth. He also slipped in a little olive brine; not too much just a quarter of a teaspoon to, in his words, \u2018enhance the flavor of the olive.\u2019 And he was respectful of the drink\u2019s potency,\u201d noting that \u201cunless you sip it, you\u2019re going to drink too much.\u201d\n\nMy own dad would concur. At our family beach house on Chesapeake Bay, we\u2019ll regularly gather to watch a ballgame, have dinner, hang out, and always enjoy a Martini. It\u2019s become his favorite drink, as it\u2019s a way of communing with his late wife, and my mom, who passed in 2004. It was also her favorite drink, that is, when I made them.\n\nShe\u2019d take a sip, and she\u2019d smile and say \u201cboy, that\u2019s good. Philip, you make the best Martini.\u201d So, I usually mix us all a Martini (3 to 1, Fords Gin, Dolin Dry Vermouth, 2 drops Regans\u2019 Orange Bitters, three chilled olives). My dad now raises his Martini glass to heaven, and says \u201chere\u2019s to you, sweetheart.\u201d He\u2019ll take a sip, then whisper \u201cboy, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nMy dad will never drink them too quickly because he doesn\u2019t want this cherished moment of thinking about my mom to fly by too fast. I recently asked my dad if he had any other opinions about Martinis and was he fussy about this or that? \u201cNo, any Martini is fine with me, as long as you make them,\u201d he said with a wink. We don\u2019t always agree on things, but that\u2019s an opinion I can certainly live with.\n\nCheers to you mom, and cheers to you dad.
