I'm not going to lie and sugarcoat it,\" Lloyd said. \"It was absolutely the worst time in my life. It affected my relationship with my husband, with my friends. It really was the rock bottom of my entire career.\"\n\n\"It sucked. It absolutely sucked,\" she added.\n\nThe 37-year-old did not start in any of the United States' World Cup matches this summer, playing just 194 minutes in total. Still, Lloyd appeared in each of the USWNT's seven games in France \u2014 more than teammates Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan \u2014 and scored three goals in that stretch.\n\n\"There's no denying it, I deserved to be out on that field that whole World Cup,\" Lloyd said. \"But I wasn't.\"\n\nLloyd told Foudy that she \"saw the writing on the wall\" after sitting for 10 weeks thanks to a \"really, really bad\" ankle sprain she suffered while playing with her former National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) club team, Houston Dash, in 2017.\n\n\"I felt like from that point on I never really had a chance, like I was written off,\" Lloyd said. \"No matter how well I played in training, no matter how well I played in the game, it was like 'you're on the bench and you just need to accept it.'\"\n\nRead more: Simone Biles is the most dominant athlete on the planet, and now she's primed to become the most accomplished Olympian of all time\n\n\"For me, I'm never just going to accept that, especially when I know what I'm capable of,\" Lloyd added.\n\nLloyd was notably and publicly candid regarding her dissatisfaction with her playing time, repeatedly sharing her grievances with the media throughout the USWNT's 2019 World Cup run. The midfielder-turned-striker never hesitated to speak openly, she said, because she shared those same sentiments directly with then-head coach Jill Ellis.\n\n\"I had loads of conversations with Jill,\" Lloyd said. \"I remember having one in particular where she told me 'you've done it all, you have nothing left to prove' and I said 'no, I have a lot to prove.'\"\n\nStill, Lloyd said that she was glad to be apart of the squad and was \"super happy for my teammates and happy for Megan [Rapinoe], who put the team on her back.\"\n\nBut when it comes to the future, the Delran, New Jersey, native still sees herself as a major role player for the USWNT. She believes she is deserving of a starting role and hopes the heir to Ellis' spot in front of the becnh will treat her as such heading into the 2020 Olympic games in Tokyo.\n\n\"I hope a coach comes in that values me, respects me, wants me part of the Olympic plans,\" Lloyd said. \"There's no question that my ability is there. I'm able to do it \u2014 physically, I'm able to do it.\"", "description": "\"There's no denying it, I deserved to be out on that field that whole World Cup, but I wasn't,\" USWNT star Carli Lloyd said.", "authors": ["Meredith Cash"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d652f442e22af0f81659545?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
