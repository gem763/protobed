She\u2019s the one who made a proposal. She is the one who leads this,\u201d she said.\n\nMacron seemingly put the blame Thursday on leaders of Parliament political groups for failing to make good on an alleged deal, and on Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen who he said had reassured him that Goulard would be fine. The leaders of the Socialists & Democrats and the European People's Party both publicly denied such an arrangement.\n\nVisibly tense, Montchalin expressed frustration at the Parliament for making full use of its prerogative to scrutinize and veto Commission nominees.\n\n\"The parliament is not a court,\u201d she said. \u201cSylvie Goulard went before three commissions, she spent six hours testifying [Goulard's two hearings lasted 4,5 hours total], she was examined by the committee on legal affairs that is in charge of looking at whether she has conflicts of interest\u2026 this committee said nothing on conflict of interest,\" Montchalin said.\n\nMontchalin blamed political games and rancor for the French candidate's rejection, saying the compromise worked by EU leaders on nominations for top European jobs \u2014 that had Manfred Weber, the lead candidate for the EPP, side-tracked in the process \u2014 \"bothered some\" in the European Parliament.\n\nThe French minister declared that France is now \"awaiting instructions\" from the President of the Commission on a way forward, and underlined the numerous \"French ideas\" contained in the work program of the Commission. \"We don\u2019t want this to be lost.\u201d", "description": "The French nominee was rejected by the European Parliament on Thursday.", "authors": ["Louise Guillot", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume", "Laura Kayali", "Rym Momtaz"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1136458921-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
