They constructed a battlefield by piecemeal, transporting our world into theirs. And, channeling it all through a powerful new framework, they brought their vision to life. Building a world of Modern Warfare In attempting to create the most realistic war game on the market, game developers at Infinity Ward started by surveying the world around them. Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nBURBANK, Calif. \u2014 The bones of the game were laid with drones and cameras, phone calls and questions, requirements and innovations. Rather than a fanciful brainstorm followed by code and keystrokes, as many would assume of a video game\u2019s creation process, the latest title in the ever-expanding \u201cCall of Duty\u201d pantheon formed around research and revelations, groundwork for a multi-million-dollar development process representative of the modern, multi-billion-dollar gaming industry.\n\nIt\u2019s a process that required a marriage of technological innovation and well-sourced storytelling, with the goal to produce the most realistic portrayal possible of modern armed conflict by a video game. It will culminate Oct. 25 with the release of \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,\" a title developed by Infinity Ward studio that figures to be one of the top-selling games \u2014 if not the top-selling game \u2014 of 2019. And its content has already been authenticated by two men who know well the game\u2019s subject matter.\n\nThe green-tinted footage plays on the Infinity Ward theater screen as lethal silhouettes sporting night vision creep through a house. Threats are assessed and eliminated, the silence broken by the crackle of comms and the rattle of gunfire.\n\nSteve Sanders, left, and Mitch Hall are retired U.S. Navy SEALs who served as consultants for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. (Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post)\n\nMitch Hall and Steve Sanders, both retired U.S. Navy SEALs, watch a scene that looks as if it were captured by a body camera during one of their past deployments. In the back of the theater, Infinity Ward Studio Narrative Director Taylor Kurosaki and Jacob Minkoff, \u201cModern Warfare\u2019s\u201d campaign gameplay director, listen along with several others while Hall narrates the action. He explains the mechanics of the soldiers\u2019 movements and the rationale of their lethal decision-making as the on-screen sequence reaches its climax. Special operatives from the British SAS storm the attic of a terrorist-occupied town home and spot a woman standing in the center of the room.\n\n\u201cNo weapon, that\u2019s the first thing,\u201d Hall says of what his training has taught him to see. \u201cThat\u2019s the first math problem you have. She seems, at least for the moment, compliant. And so that compliance gives us some time to do some more math and figure out if she\u2019s going to remain compliant.\u201d\n\nShe does not and falls to a burst of suppressed gunfire after diving for a detonator.\n\n\u201cI keep saying \u2018the math,\u2019\u201d Hall continues, reminding the audience in the theater of what the soldiers in the game had encountered in the house before this scene, with nearly every person in the house proving hostile. \u201cAll those floors, you keep doing the math. She had a chance to do the right thing. Then she made the bad choice.\u201d\n\nIf the bones of \u201cModern Warfare\u201d were first set three years earlier, the action on the screen is the game\u2019s body brought to life. It illustrates the tension of the game\u2019s script with the tactics demonstrated by real-world soldiers, a blend the game\u2019s creators hope brings a level of believability no \u201cCall of Duty\u201d game has reached before now.\n\nBernardo Antoniazzi, principal technical artist for Infinity Ward, poses in the photogrammetry room he designed for the studio. (Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post)\n\nBelievability through a \u2018big ball of light\u2019\n\nInfinity Ward began to infuse more reality into its creation by quite literally putting more reality into the game. Behind a nondescript door and inside a white-walled room of approximately 100 square feet in the bowels of Infinity Ward\u2019s Burbank, Calif., studio sits a kind of teleportation device.\n\nA cage of steel surrounds a small white platform, its exterior draped with cables to cameras and flash-bulbs. Any item placed on that platform \u2014 anything from a used cigar to a full-grown man \u2014 can be transported into the game with the push of a button.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a big ball of light,\u201d Barry Sloane says of his recollection of the rig. Sloane, the actor who plays the hero role of SAS soldier Captain Price, was just one of the thousands of objects teleported into the pixels of \u201cModern Warfare.\u201d\n\nThe process is known as photogrammetry, a craft through which the Infinity Ward team captured high-resolution photos of an object from every angle, stitching them together to generate a three-dimensional digital replica they can then alter and manipulate using their software. The end result is a photo-realistic digital item far more lifelike than any computer-generated object.\n\nNot only is the result more realistic, but the process is more efficient than the common practice of building a digital asset via computer generation. With photogrammetry, what used to take six weeks to create can now be scanned and refined in one, according to Infinity Ward Studio Art Director Joel Emslie. Over the past three years, everything from old tires to demolished cars to a tank have been scanned into \u201cModern Warfare.\u201d\n\nHow video games use photogrammetry To help create a more realistic environment for \u201cCall of Duty: Modern Warfare,\u201d the developers at Infinity Ward employed photogrammetry, the process of creating a digital asset using high-resolution photographs of real-world objects. For video games, in-game objects are most commonly created by developers via computer generation, building each item from its basic shape and then working down to tiny details \u2014 a time-consuming process. Photogrammetry instead records all of that information \u2014 size, shape and details \u2014 through a series of photos taken from every angle, producing a highly detailed digital re-creation in a significantly shorter time. First, the object is photographed from all possible angles. Infinity Ward\u2019s rig consists of 200 cameras all connected to shoot simultaneously, allowing them to capture all the data they need in under a second. Those photographs are then stitched together to create a three-dimensional digital version of the object. That digital object contains millions of tiny polygons to give the object its shape, and while it results in a super-detailed asset, it also requires a lot of processing power for a computer or console to display it for the user. So, a little more work is required to scale down the detail. The car shown here was captured using photogrammetry through collaboration with Infinity Ward partner Studio 727. The capture process was completed within three days. Over 10,000 high-resolution photos were captured of the vehicle and then processed through photogrammetry software. After two days of processing, photos were rendered into a single object consisting of a 50 million polygon 3D-mesh. The highly detailed model was then cleaned up for a week by an internal artist, who removed tiny imperfections in the mesh. To make sure the game doesn\u2019t grind to a halt, the game\u2019s designers then scaled back the detail to ease the burden on the hardware as the screen is populated with the game\u2019s graphics. After running the model through additional software, which takes about an hour, it produced a game-resolution, 50,000-polygon model. Artist Daniel Wapner then spent a couple of days polishing the textures, removing shadows from the textures on the model and generating gloss and specular maps, to give the materials on the vehicle realistic responses to the game\u2019s environment lighting. The final result is what you see here and will be included in downloadable content available after the game\u2019s October release.\n\nClick to interact with the object\n\n\u201cIf you were to just build a character from scratch in software it could take six weeks to do all that work, and a lot of that time is to work on the little nuances, the subtleties, the paint chips and things. That\u2019s what really takes time,\u201d Emslie says. But with photogrammetry, the photography captures the details for you.\n\n\u201cBuilding a costume for real and just going out and hiking in it \u2026 or rub some old teabags on it to make it look old, that's incredibly easier to do in the physical world rather than doing it digitally, where you're using software to simulate all that wear and tear,\u201d Emslie says.\n\nThe process also has a side benefit in terms of creativity, Emslie says. Putting hands on real-world objects and costumes brings the creators deeper into the game\u2019s universe. Emslie compares the vibe to the early work of Industrial Light and Magic, the shop that brought the world of \u201cStar Wars\u201d to life in the late 1970s and early 1980s and helped revolutionize Hollywood special effects.\n\nThese helmets were scanned into the \"Call of Duty\" game by means of photogrammetry. (Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post) Photogrammetry allows for objects (and people) to be scanned into games in a process much quicker than computer generation.

(Philip Cheung/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe prop procurement process can sometimes lead to some awkward situations, however.\n\nThere was one time when Emslie\u2019s team drew a curious glance at the checkout counter of a local hardware store when they purchased items to replicate an improvised bomb. (\u201cI\u2019m probably on so many watch lists,\u201d says Madison Cromwell, a producer at Infinity Ward.) There was also the time they grabbed a used mattress they\u2019d spotted on the side of the road, only to be advised against bringing it inside the studio for fear of bed bugs. They scanned it in a back lot instead.\n\n\u201cWe turn into kind of mad scientists with this stuff,\u201d Emslie says.\n\nTheir experiments however have provided a life-like, super-detailed setting in which the plot of \u201cModern Warfare\u201d plays out. But it also brought an additional challenge to the creative process. The computational power required for such sleek graphics from the photogrammetry, along with demands relating to scaling and rendering while maintaining a smooth game-playing experience, made it clear the game would require a stronger framework.\n\nPutting bodies in motion\n\nWork began on \u201cModern Warfare\u2019s\u201d new game engine five years ago and will continue even after its release. During that process, Activision opened an engine technology-focused studio in Krakow, Poland, to handle the task. Rendering high-def graphics at high speeds (the goal is 60 frames per second) requires a big technological lift. To that end, Infinity Ward\u2019s developers needed new tools for the job.\n\n\u201cOnce the studio decided to make \u2018Modern Warfare,\u2019 our engineering teams sat down with the art and design departments to discuss the vision for the game. Immediately, it became clear that it would have been impossible with the previous technology to build a game with this ambition,\u201d says Michael Drobot, Infinity Ward\u2019s principal rendering engineer.\n\nDrobot\u2019s team tinkered and tweaked and ultimately innovated. Now the engine can handle both a massive battle on a wide-open field and a claustrophobic, close-quarters encounter. In the latter, the engine permits players to angle their weapons independently of the direction the character\u2019s body is facing so they can make better use of available cover while firing, a real-life tactic used by special forces when breaching a room.\n\n\u201c'Modern Warfare\u2019s' engine can allow our designers to scale the theater of action from tiny backyard alleys, all the way to city-scale maps, while providing the same level of features, quality and immersion,\u201d Drobot says.\n\nScreenshots from Call of Duty Modern Warfare (Infinity Ward)\n\nAlso of note was the way the team incorporated combat using night vision. Previous titles have simply tinted the screen green to simulate the effect. For \u201cModern Warfare,\u201d Drobot\u2019s team fully rendered the infrared spectrum.\n\n\u201cIn order to mimic real-life night vision and thermal imaging devices, we decided to go all the way and replicate the physics behind it, as well as final image post-processing,\u201d Drobot says. \u201cWe spent some time with our military consultants, tested a bunch of devices from different eras, ranging all the way from very early [World War II] models to modern 2010s hybrid thermal/night vision devices. What came out of this research was an understanding of how important those light spectrums really are, not only for visuals but also for emergent gameplay, not to mention translating the experience to our player.\u201d\n\nThe end result mimics far more closely the real-world combat missions performed by special operatives such as Hall and Sanders.\n\nWhen asked the value of night vision on the battlefield, Hall cracks, \u201cAre you really going to make me say \u2018night and day\u2019?\u201d\n\nDrobot presents a more specific example of the advantage for soldiers aiming their weapons.\n\n\u201cThe most basic example would be the NVG light illuminator,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a light attached to the characters\u2019 helmet or weapons that shines only in IR spectrum. This way it is totally invisible to the human eye, thus an enemy not equipped with an IR device won\u2019t see it \u2014 meaning your location is concealed.\u201d\n\nThis mechanic manifests at several points in the game, particularly in the SAS townhouse scene. With the engine now allowing more realistic tactical play, story leads Kurosaki and Minkoff could better make use of the expertise provided by Hall and Sanders.\n\nJacob Minkoff (left) and Taylor Kurosaki sought first-hand expertise to help them create an authentic, morally complex story. (Philip Cheung)\n\nInfusing soul from SEALs\n\nOver the course of two hours in the theater, the storytellers and SEALs take turns discussing the details and nuances that differentiate video game fantasy from the boots-on-the-ground reality lived by special forces operatives.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason \u201cModern Warfare\u201d has incorporated what Hall and Sanders repeatedly referred to as \u201cthe math.\u201d It refers to the internal computations made to identify potential threats, a formula drilled into the SEALs\u2019 minds during their combined 45 years of active duty service, including deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cThe math\u201d helps soldiers determine when to shoot and when to stand down. But on battlefields where friendly forces, civilians and enemies are sometimes indistinguishable, it seldom yields a tidy answer.\n\n\u201cI sort of naively asked the question one day: \u2018So, you just look for bad guys with guns, right? That\u2019s how you determine the bad guys? The bad guys have guns,\u2019\u201d Kurosaki says. \u201cAnd they were like, \u2018Are you kidding me? Everybody has a gun. That\u2019s no way to determine if someone is a threat to you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a dynamic moviegoers will recall from films such as \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d or \u201cZero Dark Thirty.\u201d Kurosaki and Minkoff frequently cite those films as models for what they\u2019re trying to capture in their game \u2014 a complex and confusing battleground in which life-and-death decisions must be rendered in seconds and where morality is continually questioned.\n\nA look at how the juggernaut unit was rendered (Infinity Ward)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a world right now where we have, you know, 18-year-olds who have never existed in a world that didn\u2019t have the global war on terror,\u201d Minkoff says. \u201cThey know that there\u2019s not going to be a clean, simple end to any conflict. And so what they told us is, \u2018We want characters and scenarios that are realistic and relevant to the world that we live in.\u2019 And that is a world that is morally gray.\u201d\n\nAnd so the game will have a moral compass. If players just start spraying bullets at everyone they see, the game will fail them, according to Minkoff. Make a judgement too slowly, and you\u2019ll be rebooting from your last saved checkpoint. It ratchets down the \u201cRambo\u201d elements of past shooter games and emphasizes a dynamic similar to what SEALs and other special forces units face, albeit with far lower stakes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said that it\u2019s just as important to know when not to pull the trigger as to know when to pull the trigger,\u201d Hall says. \u201cPulling the trigger when you\u2019re not supposed to gets you into a lot of trouble. I don\u2019t even mean by the media, or anything like that. I mean, maybe now the bad guys know where you are, or now it\u2019s really turned into a fight where before you could have just held off.\u201d\n\nProduction sketch from a scene from Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

()\n\nVideo games have often focused on the entertainment-first idea that players derive satisfaction from spraying their weapons while enjoying a sense of invincibility. That\u2019s the diametrical opposite of what Hall and Sanders faced in the field.\n\nPrevious versions of \u201cCall of Duty\u201d have often featured a sequence in which the player barges into a room, gun blazing, to take out the bad guys. The SEALs quickly dispelled the game\u2019s designers of that notion.\n\n\u201cWe were still operating under the pretense that you kick down a door and you say everybody throw your hands up and you just come in with shock and awe,\u201d Kurosaki says. \u201cOur [consultants] were like, 'We don\u2019t do anything like that. We haven\u2019t done that for years. It\u2019s just too dangerous. Why would you throw yourself into an unknown situation? Dive right into the middle of it and then get into a big shootout? That\u2019s not safe.\u2019 These guys \u2026 everyone needs to come home. You know, one lost guy is an unacceptable amount of casualties.\u201d\n\nHall and Sanders both hope the game produces a better understanding of what they and other servicemen and women face on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen it in other entertainment products where they think it\u2019s super robotic, and it\u2019s perfect and clean,\u201d Hall says. \u201cIn fact, people are bumping into each other and you can\u2019t see all the time and all the while you\u2019re still making those critical decisions. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of calamity, if you will.\u201d\n\nThere could be some hazard, too, in making what may be one of the most realistic first-person shooter games to date. The \u201cCall of Duty\u201d franchise was specifically named by Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in connection with a mass shooting in El Paso this year. And while there has been no evidence to support a causal link between shootings and violent video games, it is a stigma with which the gaming industry has often been confronted, perhaps more often than other media.\n\n\u201c\u2018Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019 is an \u2018M\u2019 rated video game intended for mature audiences,\u201d Minkoff says, referring to the game\u2019s evaluation from the Entertainment Software Rating Board. \u201cAnd in the same way that a movie like \u2018Sicario\u2019 or \u2018Zero Dark Thirty\u2019 or \u2018Black Hawk Down\u2019 is intended for a certain type of viewer, we want to be making experiences for those types of viewers.\u201d\n\nThe game\u2019s realistic qualities weigh on Hall and Sanders slightly differently. In their role, they\u2019re lending their names and service records to what is ultimately, the game\u2019s developers remind, an entertainment product. They know there will be compromises.\n\n\u201cWe have these conversations where we say, \u2018This is what it would look like if it was done in real world,\u2019\u201d Sanders says. \u201cAnd then of course we know the balance between real world and gameplay. So we have these conversations and we kind of just meet in the middle. \u2026 So there\u2019s some artificiality that we take in made-up game world and then try to make it look as good as possible.\u201d\n\nAnd what are they most concerned about the game getting right?\n\n\u201cOperational logic \u2026 it has to make sense,\u201d Hall says. \u201cThe characters have to be motivated about the thing they\u2019re actively going after. \u2026\n\n\u201cWe're trying to make it authentic. They're trying to make it entertaining and authentic. And we finally whittle it down to something that we can both live with.\u201d\n\nThe finished product will release next week, a final blend of pixels, drama and flesh-and-blood soldiers.\n\nInfinity Ward's newest Call of Duty title is set for an Oct. 25 release.
