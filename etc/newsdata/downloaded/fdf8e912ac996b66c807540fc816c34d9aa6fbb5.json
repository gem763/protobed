Paylor (@TerezPaylor) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nNamely, when Jackson\u2019s on the move, you better sink your hips, watch his feet and, well, pray.\n\n\u201cYou gotta swarm, man,\u201d Okafor said with a chuckle. \u201cYou gotta swarm.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free. Here\u2019s how.]\n\nAnd to hear others tell it, sometimes that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all talking about Lamar,\u201d asked defensive linebacker Chris Jones, who had just ambled over to the locker next to Okafor\u2019s. \u201cAw, man. He sauced me up a couple times.\u201d\n\n\u201cSauce ain\u2019t the word,\u201d Okafor replied with a laugh. \u201cBlender.\u201d\n\nAll that praise might sound over the top, or easy to dismiss as a type of winner\u2019s graciousness, especially given Jackson\u2019s final stat line, as he completed 22 of 43 passes for 267 yards, zero touchdowns or interceptions while rushing for 46 yards and a touchdown on eight carries.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut, really, you had to watch what Jackson did over the course of the game to fully appreciate what the 22-year-old did (especially late). With the Ravens on the ropes trailing 30-13 early in the fourth quarter, Jackson navigated two scoring drives that narrowed the gap to 30-22 with 6:39 left in the game.\n\nJackson did so largely by dodging defenders to extend plays\u201a in spite of the controlled rush the Chiefs used to keep him in the pocket, often using his athleticism to pirouette away from trouble and lob downfield completions no one saw coming.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese plays make life miserable for defenders and makes teammates (and opponents) believe the Ravens are never out of the game.\n\n\u201cNo. 8 [Jackson], he has it,\u201d Chiefs safety Tyrann Mathieu told Yahoo Sports, shaking his head at his locker with the same wide-eyed appreciation Okafor had. \u201cI think 15 [Mahomes] has it. Four from the Texans [Deshaun Watson], I think he has it. And obviously [Tom] Brady.\n\n\u201cGuys that [you] don\u2019t look on the scoreboard \u2014 they\u2019re always in it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd please believe, multiple Ravens swore that\u2019s how they feel about Jackson, so much so that when told of the Chiefs\u2019 repeated praise of their second-year teammate, they basically shrugged.\n\n\u201cI mean, you can\u2019t lie when it\u2019s on film,\u201d running back Mark Ingram told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe know Mahomes is special, but they know [Lamar\u2019s] special. He gives defenses and coordinators headaches for sure. You can have a perfect play, defend it, and he\u2019s able to make some crazy stuff happen. He\u2019s the real deal, man.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything can happen at any time with this guy,\u201d left tackle Ronnie Stanley said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous, man,\u201d said wide receiver Willie Snead IV, a recipient of one of Jackson\u2019s most eye-popping pass plays Sunday.\n\nYet, the Ravens fell to 2-1 after opening the season with wins over two of the NFL\u2019s worst teams, the Dolphins and Cardinals. The Ravens came up short in their bid to prove themselves worthy of being mentioned among the AFC\u2019s elite with the Chiefs and New England Patriots.\n\nSome of the credit for that goes to the Chiefs\u2019 improved defense, which contained Jackson on the ground for the most part (aside from a ridiculous red-zone scramble that led to a fourth quarter touchdown) and largely managed to take away the downfield and play-action shots the Ravens feasted on through the season\u2019s first two weeks.\n\nLamar Jackson won't let the Ravens die \ud83d\ude24pic.twitter.com/00fpmqb3NJ \u2014 Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) September 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nKansas City\u2019s main problem was the Ravens, who feature one of the NFL\u2019s most varied run games, churned out 203 rushing yards and four touchdowns (three from Ingram). And with the ground game rolling, Jackson was also decisive in his check-downs and initial progressions, something that can\u2019t be said for his performance at times in 2018.\n\n\u201cOh, [he\u2019s] so improved [from last year],\u201d Chiefs inside linebacker Anthony Hitchens said. \u201cOh yeah, definitely. He\u2019s confident, he\u2019s not dropping back and taking off \u2026 he\u2019s actually reading his guys, throwing it quick, going through his progressions.\u201d\n\nJackson still has ways to go to join the ranks of elite quarterbacks like Brady and Mahomes. Start with his field vision, as there were times he appeared to miss Mathieu (who nearly intercepted him twice) in coverage. What\u2019s more, while Jackson is more decisive than he used to be in the pocket, he can become a more dangerous passer when he consistently hits his third or fourth reads.\n\nThe keyword is \u201cpasser.\u201d\n\nAs an overall player, Jackson already fits that standard, so much so that multiple members from the Ravens and Chiefs privately noted that although the two teams aren\u2019t slated to face each other again in 2019, a playoff meeting in January seems likely, largely because Jackson figures to get only better over the next three-plus months.\n\n\u201cAll the guys that I knew on the [Chiefs], all of them said, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll see y\u2019all down the line,\u2019\u201d Stanley told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe know how good we are, we just have to keep getting better.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a process that must start with their phenomenally gifted quarterback, one who must still improve but whose feats of athleticism Sunday still compelled his opponents to pay their respects, even in victory.\n\n\u201cTells you what type of athlete he is,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cOne of a kind.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Lamar Jackson produced quite the highlights in a loss to K.C.
