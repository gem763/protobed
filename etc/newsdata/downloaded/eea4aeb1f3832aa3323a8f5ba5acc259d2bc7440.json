Applications are not submitted for generic versions of about 10% of approved brand-name drugs.\n\nA recent analysis of one-month treatment costs of generic drugs over the last 14 years found that consumers will pay an average price of $796 each month this year, compared to $98 in 2006. The 46brooklyn Research study, released Tuesday, also shows that the top 25% of the 2019 generic \u201cclass\u201d drugs have a sticker price of more than $1,800 a month.\n\nFrom 1960 to 2017, inflation-adjusted retail prescription drug spending increased from $90 to $1,025 on a per capita basis, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis cited by the Peterson Kaiser Health System Tracker.\n\n\u201cWe are not benefitting from competition for reducing prices, and, therefore, we ought to strengthen the way the system works to be more reliable,\u201d said Mr. Hussain. \u201cWe are at the verge of not being able to afford our medicines.\u201d\n\nThe National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education is a nonprofit that seeks to improve how medicines are made. It cites outdated manufacturing control technologies and brand-name drugmakers\u2019 guard over knowledge that could be used to produce generic drugs as major factors souring the competitive drug market.\n\nBrand-name firms keep their production knowledge as proprietary trade secrets, the nonprofit group says. Often times, generic drugmakers do not have the knowledge to make an off-patent version.\n\nMr. Hussain said that companies producing generics have to start from scratch with limited resources, a shorter timeline and smaller profit margins. About five to six companies that make the same drug are needed in order to reduce costs, he said.\n\nWhile prices for common generics decreased by 37% since 2014, brand-name drugs have increased by more than 60%, an Express Scripts overall prescription price index shows.\n\nThe National Institute for Pharmaceutical Technology and Education, which is comprised of 18 universities, is aiming to develop public domain information on what can improve manufacturing processes of generics and reduce the risks of market withdrawals, recalls and import alerts.\n\nBy developing a central database of public information, Mr. Hussain said, there is also an opportunity to create domestic manufacturing jobs, noting how the U.S. largely relies on other countries to manufacture drugs.\n\nAbout 40% of generic drug products are imported from India, and China manufactures more than 90% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in drug products sold in the U.S. market.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
