SoftBank did not immediately respond.\n\nBut if WeWork were to eventually look to restructure its debts, existing junk-bond holders could end up waiting behind newer creditors for any potential payout.\n\nAnd as investors mulled the debt package, yields on WeWork\u2019s junk bonds jumped to about 12% Wednesday from a low of 9% on Tuesday, and an initial yield of 7.8% some 18 months ago at issuance when the company still was considered a rising star. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.\n\nTo be sure, WeWork\u2019s bond yields have been elevated since the company\u2019s plans for its highly-anticipated initial public offering were thwarted last month, amid rising criticism from potential investors about the company\u2019s significant cash burn, hefty $47 billion pile of long-term leases and lofty $47 billion private valuation, which this week was slashed to about $8 billion.\n\nCheck out: Here\u2019s what savvy bond investors are saying about the failed WeWork IPO\n\nBut more broadly, debt investors have shown no lack of appetite when it comes to financing other unicorns that remain unprofitable, which was underscored this week when Netflix NFLX, +1.72% , another cash-burning company, was able to raise another $2.2 billion in the junk-bond market at yields well below 5%.\n\nCheck out: Netflix sells $2.2 billion of junk bonds as it braces for onslaught of competition\n\nRide-hailing service Uber Technologies UBER, +1.60% also raised $1.2 billion in the junk-bond market last month, more than its initial $750 million target, while paying investors yields of 7.5%.\n\nAnd while the debt markets may be open, SoftBank will need to show investors rattled by WeWork\u2019s swift reversal of fortune that it can cut costs and eventually turn a profit, said Loren Trimble, chief executive officer of AArete, a global consulting firm.\n\n\u201cOne thing they have to do is get more revenue out of its footprint,\u201d said Trimble, who estimates that WeWork could blow through its new financing package in about 10 months without implementing significant costs savings.\n\nIn that vein, Trimble suggested that WeWork immediately increase the amount of rent its charges users of its office-share spaces.\n\n\u201cThey also have to go down their list of $47 billion of lease commitments, and one-by-one renegotiation contracts and come up with better pricing,\u201d he said.", "description": "Existing WeWork bonds could be worth less in the event of a restructuring after SoftBank proposes $5 billion of fresh debt as part of its rescue package", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT897_WeWork_ZG_20191023200659.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
