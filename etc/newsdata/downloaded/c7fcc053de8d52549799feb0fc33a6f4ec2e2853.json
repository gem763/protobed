It is understood the Commonwealth was wary about the threat to its promised budget surplus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNSW is already investigating leasing out its forestry corporation, a softwood plantation business, as part of a plan for more asset sell-offs to pay for infrastructure projects.\n\n'Our success is their success'\n\nIt is also looking at selling its remaining 49 per cent share of the WestConnex road project.\n\n\"The federal government can play an important role, whether it's asset recycling or other reform opportunities, when they put money in the table,'' he said.\n\n\"If they were to give us a greater contribution to major projects, that would unlock funds for minor projects.\n\n\"We're all looking at ways to grow the economy. Our success is their success.''\n\nMr Pallas said Victoria supported NSW's push to bring back asset recycling but added it was of questionable benefit to Victoria because it had very few assets left to sell.\n\nHe said with the pressures on the economy caused by global factors, he agreed with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe that the Commonwealth needs to do more in terms of stimulus.\n\n\"We'll hold our nerve and continue our investment,'' he said.", "description": "NSW and Victoria say Canberra has a greater capacity to fast-track infrastructure spending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6237%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_47%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/b2798f40f22dbe9cba7390dc3924d9935e363cb5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
