I'm not sure that I've ever even heard of a Category 5. I knew it existed. And I've seen some Category 4's \u2014 you don't even see them that much.\n\n\"But a Category 5 is something that \u2014 I don't know that I've ever even heard the term other than I know it's there. That's the ultimate, and that's what we have, unfortunately.\"\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale fact-checked Trump's claims and found that he had made similar statements on the existence of Category 5 storms on several occasions since he took office.\n\n\"I never even knew a Category 5 existed,\" he said on September 14, 2017, just days after Hurricane Irma \u2014 a Category 5 storm that battered parts of the Caribbean islands before weakening to a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall in the Florida Keys.\n\nLater in September, Hurricane Maria devastated parts of Dominica, the US Virgin Islands as well as Puerto Rico. The Category 5 storm which weakened to a Category 4 when it hit Puerto Rico left nearly 3,000 people dead, and the US territory is still recovering from the devastating impacts of the natural disaster.\n\n\"So we've never seen it,\" Trump said on September 26, 2017 about Maria's impact. \"It actually touched down as a Category 5. People have never seen anything like that.\"\n\nIn October 2017, Trump reiterated claims that Category 5 storms were inconceivable, stating that \"nobody has ever heard of a 5 hitting land.\"\n\nAnd in May 2019, months after Category 5 Hurricane Michael ravaged the Florida panhandle, Trump told the crowd at a campaign rally in Panama City Beach, Florida that he had \"never heard about Category 5's before.\"\n\n\"A Category 5 is big stuff,\" he said.\n\nDorian is the fourth Category 5 storm to threaten the US under Trump\n\nREUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\nFour Category 5 storms have actually threatened the US since the beginning of his presidency \u2014 Irma in 2017, Maria in 2017, Michael in 2018, and Dorian, which is slowly headed toward the Florida coast but may not actually make landfall in the state, according to AccuWeather forecasts as of 10 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\nAccuWeather predicts that Dorian may still cause damage to eastern parts of Florida even if the storm does not directly hit the coastline.\n\nRead more: I've been through the eye of a Category 4 hurricane \u2014 here are 7 things you should do to protect your money before and after\n\nChanges to Dorian's strength are expected through Monday depending on the position and conditions inside the eye of the storm.\n\nA chart showing the most intense hurricanes that have made landfall in the US.
