As Alabama\u2019s quarterback, he played in three national championship games and the annual Iron Bowl against Auburn. The graduate transfer sees Saturday\u2019s opponent as simply the next one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all external factors,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to change the way I think about something, what I tell my teammates or how we\u2019re going to approach it. We\u2019re going to continue to approach it by trying to go 1-0 every week.\u201d\n\nEveryone else is fired up over a game that will affect the Big 12 and College Football Playoff races. The sixth-ranked Sooners (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) and 11th-ranked Longhorns (4-1, 2-0) probably can\u2019t afford a loss in Dallas if they want a shot at a national title.\n\nEven without all the added stakes, this is a game that always gets circled on the calendar.\n\n\u201cWhat I am not is not one to downplay a rivalry game,\u201d Oklahoma defensive coordinator Alex Grinch said. \u201cTo ignore the implications, I think, is naive as a coach and is make-believe. I also will say that my thrill in terms of a Saturday is not limited to rivalry games either. But I have a great appreciation for the opponent, what it means to this university.\u201d\n\nThe game also will likely affect the Heisman Trophy race since Hurts is among the likely contenders and Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger could push his way into the conversation.\n\nTexas won last year\u2019s regular-season matchup , but Oklahoma won the rematch 39-27 in the Big 12 title game.\n\nLonghorns left tackle Sam Cosmi said Texas has unfinished business with the Sooners. And though Oklahoma enters the game ranked No. 1 nationally in total offense and No. 2 in scoring offense, the Longhorns believe they have the answers.\n\n\u201cThey have a really explosive offense and are a really good team overall. I won\u2019t take that away from them,\u201d Cosmi said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve played anyone like us.\u201d\n\nHITTING HURTS\n\nHurts leads all quarterbacks nationally with 99.8 yards rushing per game. Texas defensive back B.J. Foster said keys to stopping Oklahoma include forcing Hurts to throw - and getting a lick on him when he tries to run.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, he doesn\u2019t like to slide, so he\u2019s going to engage contact with you,\u201d Foster said. \u201cHe\u2019s not dumb. He\u2019s going to have to slide, or it\u2019s not going to be good for him.\u201d\n\nOklahoma averages 288.4 yards rushing per game, while Texas allows just 116.8.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sound on the run game. He\u2019s going to have to pass the ball,\u201d Foster said.\n\nTexas might not want Hurts to pass - the Longhorns are allowing 325 yards per game through the air.\n\nTRICK PLAYS\n\nTexas has been using them the last two games. A double-pitch pass to tight end Cade Brewer led to a touchdown against Oklahoma State. Then Texas unveiled a cross-field lateral to Cosmi, who rumbled for a touchdown at West Virginia. Both were critical second-half scores. Texas also used a receiver pass for a touchdown against the Sooners last year. Ehlinger said all three scoring plays were put in the week of the game.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t like kicking field goals in the red zone,\u201d Texas coach Tom Herman said. \u201cSo we are going to pull out all the stops to score touchdowns down there.\u201d\n\nBURT AGAIN\n\nTexas senior wide receiver John Burt has certainly seen his share of games in this border rivalry - Saturday will be his sixth time playing against the Sooners. Burt played against the Sooners twice last season, but because he played in only four games he was able to redshirt for 2018. He led the team in catches as a freshman, but his playing time has been reduced each year since as he pursued a track career. His touchdown catch last week against West Virginia was his first since 2017.\n\nDICKER THE KICKER\n\nTexas sophomore kicker Cameron Dicker became an internet meme last season when television cameras showed him giving a teammate a head nod and a wink before kicking the game-winning field against the Sooners. Dicker has made four of six field goal attempts this season but missed his only one last week at West Virginia. He booted a career-long 57-yarder earlier this season against Rice.\n\nEHLINGER\u2019S RESPECT\n\nEhlinger has had issues with both of Oklahoma\u2019s past two quarterbacks, Heisman winners Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray. He said he has nothing but admiration for Hurts: \u201cFollowing his story and understanding what he\u2019s persevered through, unbelievable respect for him and what he\u2019s been able to do at the college level. I extremely excited to get out there Saturday and compete against him because he\u2019s such a respectable guy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Jim Vertuno in Austin, Texas contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts is one of the few people who won't make a big deal about Saturday's showdown with Texas.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cliff Brunt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/oklahoma_kansas_football_28557_c0-134-3235-2021_s1200x700.jpg?e126263b4293b7b578e0491859fae6ec51d39d2c", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
