Weak economic growth, high unemployment and substantial slack in the economy suggest inflation will remain below target this year and next, analysts say, requiring more easing.\n\nCopom reiterated that the government must press on with economic reforms to help keep inflation expectations anchored. But it removed a reference in recent statements that the upside threat to inflation if these reforms stalled was the \u201cdominant\u201d risk.\n\nThe central banks of almost every major developed and emerging market economy, from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to Brazil\u2019s Copom and the South African Reserve Bank, are easing policy to boost flagging growth.", "description": "Brazil's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to a new record low of 5.50% on Wednesday as expected and suggested more rate cuts are in the pipeline, highlighting an increasingly uncertain global outlook and tame domestic inflation.", "authors": ["Jamie Mcgeever", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
