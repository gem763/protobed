Meanwhile, fears of a no-deal Brexit had led the mid-caps to their first monthly fall since May.\n\n\"Gains may be fragile,\" Wilson said of the FTSE 100's rise on Monday. \"After a rough August though, traders should buckle up for more volatility in September.\"\n\nHeavyweight miners Rio Tinto (L: ) and Glencore (L: ) rose after China's pledge to support its economy supported iron ore prices and nickel prices rose on Indonesia's move to expedite ore exports ban.\n\nOn a low-key day for corporate news, Marks & Spencer (L: ) shed 1.2% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) reinstated coverage on the stock with a 'sell' rating, saying recent trading patterns in the retailer \"continued to be disappointing\".", "description": "FTSE weathers trade fears as weaker pound boosts exporters", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF810HZ_L.jpg"}
