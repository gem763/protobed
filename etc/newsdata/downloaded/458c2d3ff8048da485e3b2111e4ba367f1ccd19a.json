Earnings also topped Wall Street estimates, letting investors overlook a tepid forecast for the final quarter of the year.\n\nInvestors had been bracing for a weak showing after Netflix (NASDAQ: ) delivered a disappointing quarter three months ago. The stock had been flagging for weeks. The actual results -- though far from perfect -- were a relief, sending the shares up as much as 7.9% in New York trading Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt was a really strong quarter -- not just around subscribers, the overall business performance,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said in a taped interview with Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Morris.\n\nInternational markets account for almost all of Netflix\u2019s growth -- and most of its total customers. The world\u2019s largest paid online TV network signed up 6.26 million new users outside the U.S., beating forecasts. Netflix (NASDAQ: ) expects to sign 7 million more international customers during the current three months, ending the year with its strongest overseas growth to date.\n\nThe company benefited from new seasons of a couple of its most popular shows. The teen science-fiction show \u201cStranger Things\u201d was viewed by 64 million households in its first four weeks, making it the most-watched season of original programming on Netflix (NASDAQ: ). A new season of \u201cLa Casa de Papel,\u201d a Spanish heist series, was viewed by 44 million households. It was Netflix\u2019s most-watched show in non-English-speaking countries.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: ) is looking to stoke demand outside the U.S. by investing more in international original series. The company has already released 100 seasons of local language scripted series from 17 countries, and plans to release more than 130 next year alone.\n\nOverseas markets will be even more important in the face of new competition from Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Comcast Corp (NASDAQ: ). and AT&T Inc. All four of those companies will introduce new streaming services in the next few months, starting in the U.S. While the final three months of the year are typically among the company\u2019s strongest, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) expects to add a total of 7.6 million more customers in the fourth quarter -- fewer than it did a year ago.\n\n\u2018Noisy\u2019 Launch\n\nThe new services from Disney and Apple (NASDAQ: ) both launch next month. The Disney+ platform is geared toward kids and families, with hundreds of movies and shows, including Star Wars, Avengers and Pixar fare. Apple\u2019s product is more adult-oriented and has less content.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix (NASDAQ: ) said in its quarterly letter to investors. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\u201d\n\nThe stock has taken a beating lately, dropping 21% since the prior quarter\u2019s miss was announced in July. Even after the latest rally, it\u2019s not back to its summertime highs, but Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has restored the faith of many investors.\n\nThird-quarter revenue grew 31% to $5.24 billion, just shy of Wall Street projections. Profit increased to $1.47 a share, easily beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.05. This quarter, the company forecasts earnings of 51 cents a share on sales of $5.44 billion. Both are below Wall Street estimates.\n\nRecent price hikes have lifted both profit and revenue. Those increases have slowed subscriber growth in the U.S., however. Gains in the U.S. last quarter amounted to just 520,000 new accounts, and the company is going to post its weakest growth at home in years, adding just 2.7 million customers this year.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company will continue to use the junk-bond market to finance its programming costs, which are expected to total about $15 billion this year.\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ: ) didn\u2019t say whether it would increase prices again any time soon. It does plan to test more mobile-only and cheaper plans in poorer countries across Asia, where it has the most room to grow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly low-priced compared to cable,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said. \u201cWe\u2019re winning more and more viewing.\u201d", "description": "Netflix Rises Most Since January on Booming Overseas Growth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic584447ee1e52dde88db885898dd20d60.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
