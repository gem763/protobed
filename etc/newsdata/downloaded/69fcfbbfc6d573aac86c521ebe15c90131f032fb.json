Please don't approach him or try to catch or coax him in - he's fast.\n\n'He has a loud pitched meow, which is very distinctive.'\n\nThe missing cat weighs in at more than 25lb - as big as a medium-sized dog.\n\nSavannah cats are a hybrid of a type of African wildcat called a serval and the everyday domestic mog. They are prized by collectors and can cost \u00a34,000.\n\nThe escaped animal has a blue collar on with Laura's mobile phone and email on and is chipped - but to an address in the USA\n\nThe cat is not dangerous, according to owner Laura Page, but could get spooked if people approach\n\nIt comes weeks after a mother said her two young children came within seconds of being mauled by one of the creatures as they played in their back garden.\n\nDr Neetu Nirdosh, from Hampstead, north London, said they are now too terrified to play outside after the beast circled them on the grass, baring its huge fangs before biting and tugging at her daughter's jumper.\n\nThe mother of four told how she heard her son Alexander, four, and daughter Falcon, five, scream that a 'cheetah' had entered their garden.\n\nHave you spotted the cat?
