Only we and Cameron (Nic Jackman), haunted by his guilt over letting Evan die, could see him but dead Evan is every bit as nasty as alive Evan.\n\nThis was bound to distract Cameron, as did the fact that he\u2019d cremated his mum earlier that morning in the latest instalment of \u2018Bernie Wolfe: The Long Goodbye.\u2019 So he really should have taken Serena (Catherine Russell)\u2019s advice and gone home, but nobody ever takes advice on Holby so he popped himself into his scrubs and got on with his day.\n\nHis patient o\u2019 the week was Ged (Ben Fox), of Farmer Ged\u2019s Fun Farm \u2013 \u2018A brilliant day out with the kids\u2019 as Donna (Jaye Jacobs) pointed out. Ged hadn\u2019t had a brilliant day, as he\u2019d impaled his bum on a nail and bumped his head while dressed as the Grim Reaper (for a special Halloween themed activity). Cameron didn\u2019t like the Grim Reaper mask because it was too much like Evil Expired Evan, and nor did the adorable children who\u2019d descended on AAU for trick or treat. But Ged was a sweetheart under the costume and Cameron was able to talk to him about Bernie.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Ged deteriorated, Serena discovered that the nail he\u2019d fallen on had been much larger than Cameron had assumed and had caused a serious injury that needed surgery. Ged told Cameron he had a bad feeling about the operation and made Cameron promise to tell Ged\u2019s family that he loved them if he shouldn\u2019t survive.\n\nHe did survive the op, but went into septic shock soon afterwards and died. \u2018You\u2019re killing him like you did me,\u2019 said Ghastly Ghostly Evan. Poor Cameron was unable to talk to Ged\u2019s family as he\u2019d promised and got Serena to do it, and then went to scatter Bernie\u2019s ashes in the Linden Cullen Memorial Shrubbery, under the Wyvern Wing sign. It\u2019s what she would have wanted.\n\nSacha\u2019s concerned about Jac (Picture: BBC)\n\nJac (Rosie Marcel)\u2019s mental health is starting to be a worry now. Another glimpse of Joseph (Luke Roberts) in the \u2018Previously\u2019 section (sigh) suggests that losing him again has taken its toll on her, but the immediate concern is the fear that she\u2019s about to lose daughter Emma. Another visit from Stacey (Emily Bowker), Jonny Maconie\u2019s \u2018human shield\u2019 as Jac referred to her, confirmed Jac\u2019s fears. The Maconies are moving to Edinburgh and apparently Jonny wants custody of Emma. This revelation came right at the end of an episode in which Jac had assumed it was Stacey who was trying to take her little girl away. Jac warned her that \u2018If you try any such thing I will come for you and that ineffectual excuse of a man you married and I will eviscerate you.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJac\u2019s words are still hard but we saw at various times that she\u2019s not coping \u2013 she had a panic attack and was really horrible to Fletch (Alex Walkinshaw) when he tried to help. She also pushed Sacha (Bob Barrett) away when he noticed that she seemed subdued.\n\nCan\u2019t he be left alone to do a Wordsearch in peace like all the other patients? (Picture: BBC)\n\nHer mood wasn\u2019t helped by Kian (Ramin Karimloo). As predicted, Bea (Rosalind Halstead) was back after the heart valve repair that Kian had done failed. Jac was furious with him, particularly when she spotted Kian and Bea holding hands, because remember she went to university with Kian so she also remembers Bea. She tried to get Kian to resign as Clinical Lead, but he denied everything, Fletch said he\u2019d seen no proof and Nicky (Belinda Owusu) had been warned by Kian to keep quiet. Jac isn\u2019t used to being undermined in this way.\n\nMeanwhile, Helen (Verity Marshall) was at the hospital for an ante natal class. Dominic (David Ames) assumed (quite reasonably, I think, from what Helen said) that he and Lofty (Lee Mead) were both invited, so he dutifully turned up. After he fell asleep during the relaxation exercises and Helen had to send both him and Lofty out of the room because they were being annoying, it became clear that Helen wasn\u2019t happy with Dominic\u2019s involvement. \u2018I\u2019m not sure how much a party of this Lofty even wants to be,\u2019 she said. \u2018Neither do I,\u2019 said Lofty. And neither do I, if it causes this much Dofty conflict before the baby is even born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other news, the hospital is 150 years old next week. There\u2019s only that arched bit on AAU that looks remotely that old, as the rest of it was clearly built in the 1960s, but perhaps Fletch will allude to that in the speech he wanted Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie)\u2019s help to write. As Holby\u2019s longest-serving surgeon, the health minister would definitely want to meet Ric at the ceremony, Fletch told him. \u2018I must remember to wear my formal pyjamas,\u2019 Ric sighed as he tried his best to recover from brain surgery without being harassed by colleagues.\n\nSue Haasler is the author of five novels and the official BBC Holby City book, which you can read about here.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Halloween season brought with it plenty of fears for Holby's finest, as Jac's worries got on top of her, while Cameron saw an old face.", "authors": ["Sue Haasler"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/cameron-ethan-holby-44-ad11_1572388388.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
