This is the largest and broadest team that China has sent in the 13 rounds of trade negotiations since 2018. Investors saw this as a strong commitment on behalf of the Chinese to secure a deal before they return to Beijing. But don\u2019t bet on a China deal just yet because on the very same day that Chinese officials landed in the US, the Trump Administration blacklisted 28 Chinese firms for human-rights violations and banned visas for Chinese officials linked to the mass detention of Muslims in the Xinjiang province.

German were better than expected but with each passing day, the risk of a no-deal Brexit increases. Apparently talks between UK PM Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Merkel hit a dead end. A deal based on the UK\u2019s latest proposals is highly unlikely and \u201cnearly impossible\u201d according to sources.\u201d Tensions are high with European Council President Donald Tusk accusing the UK of playing a blame game and putting the future of Europe and UK at stake on twitter.
