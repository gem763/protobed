In the back-to-school sale poster a little girl is holding a clarinet. She\u2019s holding the wind instrument with the reed away from her, so it would be against her upper lip, not her lower lip, as is correct.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one caught this?\u201d Billy marveled. \u201cNot the kid? Not the photographer? Not the ad agency? Really?!?\u201d\n\nGeraldine S. Jackson, a brass instrument major in college and a former D.C. Public Schools instrumental music teacher who lives in the District, groused that a lot of folks have trouble telling a tuba from a sousaphone.\n\nWrote Geraldine: \u201cThe tuba is an upright brass instrument, whereas the sousaphone performer enters the opening of the instrument \u2014 head first \u2014 and the tubing rests on his/her left shoulder, bell front. The tuba bell is upright! Most recently on the \u2018Jeopardy\u2019 TV show the answer given was tuba whereas the correct answer should have been sousaphone!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nImplored Geraldine: \u201cPlease, let\u2019s give John Philip Sousa, the \u2018March King,\u2019 credit for inventing the sousaphone and name it correctly!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA reader named Rob McKinney of Fairfax County caught a TV ad during the Super Bowl that featured a crowd of bystanders giving a neighbor a congratulatory \u201cslow clap\u201d as he turned into his driveway in his brand-new car.\n\nOne of the people in the driveway scene was dressed in a beekeeper\u2019s outfit.\n\n\u201cThat person had their veil on backward,\u201d wrote Rob. \u201cAs a beekeeper, it was easy to spot and still makes me fume.\u201d\n\nWhenever someone is playing chess on TV or in a movie \u2014 or is pictured at a chess board in a magazine or catalogue \u2014 Tom McCarthy of Brookeville, Md., pays attention.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI always take a close look at the arrangement of the pieces on the board,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOften they are arranged in a way that is simply impossible if following the rules.\u201d\n\nMichael W. Marceau of Rockville, Md., looks out for the American flag.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a disabled Vietnam veteran so I always notice when the U.S. flag is displayed incorrectly in TV shows or movies,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy guideline is \u2018LARS.\u2019 The U.S. flag should be displayed to the left of the audience and to the right of the speaker. Please note this the next time there is a courtroom scene: The U.S. flag needs to be on the right side of the judge.\u201d\n\nWhat makes Larry De Meo clench his fists and rail at the heavens is watching a war movie and seeing a soldier on a walkie-talkie bark the expression \u201cOver and out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWrote Larry, of North Potomac: \u201cThese two words mean two completely different things!\u201d\n\nScreenwriters, please remember:\n\n\u201cOver\u201d means I have finished my transmission and pass the conversation over to you to reply.\n\n\u201cOut\u201d means I have finished my message and am signing off.\n\nWrote Larry: \u201cUsing the two together is the same as saying \u2018I have finished my transmission and am passing over to you to reply, but, by the way, I won\u2019t be listening!\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe correct way to end such a transmission is with \u201cOut.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s something else that bugs Larry: Movies where a soldier use his teeth to pull the restraining pin out of a hand grenade.\n\n\u201cThe most famous example of this appears in Lewis Milestone\u2019s excellent 1945 movie \u2018A Walk in the Sun,\u2019 where grenades are used to attack a passing armored car and to blow up a bridge,\u201d Larry wrote.\n\nAD\n\nIt took a lot of force to pull out a pin in World War II. And for good reason: Grenades were made to hang off web belts and shirts, and they didn\u2019t want the pins being pulled out by branches or other protrusions.\n\nWrote Larry: \u201cUsing your teeth to pull the pin on a hand grenade is the best way I know of to result in dentures!\u201d\n\nWhat errors aggravate you?
