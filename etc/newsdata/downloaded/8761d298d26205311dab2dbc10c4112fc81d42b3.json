There is no freedom of speech, religion or expression in Turkey.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely a very bad man,\u201d Kanter said of Erdogan. \u201cI called him the Hitler of our century for a reason.\u201d\n\nKanter, who signed with the Celtics after playing for the New York Knicks and Portland Trail Blazers last season, said what was happening to the Kurds in northern Syria was a \u201chuman tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a lot of Kurd friends and they\u2019re amazing people,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a human tragedy because lots of innocent men, women, kids and babies are dying.\n\n\u201cAnd I think Turkey should stop its invasion in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe 27-year-old Kanter said he would continue to speak out despite the threat of reprisals to himself and his family in Turkey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to create awareness of what\u2019s going on because I have a platform,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be the voice of all those innocent people who don\u2019t have one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad because in the end, it\u2019s my country. I love my country,\u201d he said.\n\nIn basketball-mad Turkey, Kanter is regarded by Erdogan\u2019s government as a criminal because of his support for US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating a coup in 2016.\n\nKanter\u2019s support for Gulen has prompted Turkish authorities to seek an Interpol \u201cred notice\u201d or arrest warrant for him, meaning he could in theory be detained if he leaves the United States.\n\nTurkish television has refused to broadcast NBA games involving Kanter.", "description": "Washington (AFP) - Turkish NBA player Enes Kanter on Tuesday strongly condemned Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the operation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AFP-Photo_Tim-Bradbury-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
