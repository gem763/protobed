I thought we made a lot of nice plays, good individual plays on the goals.

They didn't give up much, and we didn't create much. Their goaltender played well, and they found a way to score on us.\n\n\"We've got to play better. Especially at home.\"\n\nThere was no scoring in the first period. The Panthers put nine shots on Oilers goalie Mike Smith as Edmonton sent seven shots on Bobrovsky.\n\nThe Panthers broke the deadlock 31 seconds into the second period as Aleksander Barkov dropped it back to Ekblad, who beat Smith glove side for his first goal of the season.\n\nAleksander Barkov (16) of the Panthers tries for the loose puck as Edmonton Oilers' Ethan Bear (74) defends.
