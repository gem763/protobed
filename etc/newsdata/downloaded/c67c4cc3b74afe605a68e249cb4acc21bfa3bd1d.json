Buzz60\n\nGovernors are the highest-ranking public official in a state government, effectively serving as chief executives. While the general job description is the same across the 50 states, the details can vary considerably by state. Key differences include state-specific policy priorities and legislative hurdles, population size, and of course, compensation.\n\nUnlike senators, who are also elected on a state by state basis, there is no set salary for governors. While senators earn an annual salary of $174,000 (though most senators are worth far more \u2013 this is how rich every U.S. senator is), governors\u2019 salaries vary by state \u2013 from as little as $70,000 to more than $200,000.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2019 salary information from The Council on State Governments, a policy database, to identify how much America\u2019s governors are paid in every state.\n\nWhile there is no hard and fast rule, generally, states with larger populations have higher governor salaries. Similarly, states that collect more taxes on a per capita basis tend to pay their governors more than states that collect less taxes.\n\nRetirement: Social Security has 'cheated' seniors out of $15,258 over the past decade\n\nMaine: Janet Mills (D) (Photo: United States Congress / Public Domain / Wikimedia Commons)\n\n50.
