The layoffs have been delayed from earlier this month, however, because the company struggled to afford the severance costs, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe funding from SoftBank marks a major fall from grace for WeWork, once a darling of Silicon Valley and valued at as much as $47bn earlier this year.\n\nThe company, which rents out office space, abandoned its high-profile plans to list its shares after investors questioned its large losses, the sustainability of its business model and its governance.\n\nThe significant slide in WeWork's valuation has also affected the value of employee options, with the paper wealth of workers dropping following the firm's abandoned float.\n\nJPMorgan's proposed package faced headwinds as it had not underwritten the debt and was seeking banks and other investors to back the deal.\n\nThe SoftBank offer reportedly included $5bn in new debt plus the acceleration of an earlier $1.5bn equity injection.\n\nThe equity portion of the deal was first negotiated in January based on a $47bn valuation for WeWork but SoftBank renegotiated it at a valuation of just $8bn.\n\nSoftBank, together with its $100bn Vision Fund, already owns about a third of WeWork. It has already put as much as $10.6bn into the company.", "description": "WeWork's ousted founder Adam Neumann will be paid $185m (\u00a3143m) to leave the company after the office space firm accepted a bid by investor SoftBank to provide crucial funding.", "authors": ["James Cook"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3HHA00AH2AjxEcV2Zl.GXg--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/410ed690734b233e481ccc6715ee7bb4", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
