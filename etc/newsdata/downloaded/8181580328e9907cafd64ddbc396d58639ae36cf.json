Many have been brought into Britain by people who have picked it up abroad.\n\nThese include swine flu, first detected in the UK in 2009, Ebola (2014) and the Zika virus (2014), but also lesser-known diseases such as Rift Valley fever (2013), Middle East respiratory virus (2012) and Monkeypox (2018).\n\nThe two trends pose a threat to medicine\u2019s ability to keep patients alive and could drive up the annual death toll from antibiotic resistance, which stands at 2,200.\n\n\u201cInfectious diseases don\u2019t stand still. Bacteria are locked in an evolution race with antibiotics, constantly evolving new ways to avoid their impact,\u201d said Sharon Peacock, the director of Public Health England\u2019s (PHE) national infection service.\n\nPHE highlighted the worrying trends as it outlined plans on Wednesday \u2013 contained in its new strategy on infectious diseases \u2013 to improve the NHS\u2019s ability to identify and control them as far as possible over the next five years.\n\nPotential threats to health include the risk that globalisation and growing antimicrobial resistance may combine at some point to produce a global pandemic involving a previously unknown bug \u2013 what experts call the \u201cDisease X\u201d scenario.\n\nProf Chris Witty, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said: \u201cDespite our arsenal of vaccines and antimicrobials, infectious diseases remain a real threat to public health. We are constantly faced with new threats, and antimicrobial resistance is growing.\u201d\n\nOver the last five years PHE has identified 32 \u201cpan-drug resistant bacteria\u201d that were able to resist all antibiotics thrown at them.\n\nPHE\u2019s warnings about the growing threat to health posed by infections comes as scientists report on Wednesday their discovery of a new strain of group A streptococcus bacteria. Experts say it may explain the big rise since 2016 in the number of children being affected by scarlet fever and throat infections, and warned that in some cases it can result in sepsis or toxic shock.\n\nProf Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, has warned that rising antibiotic resistance is \u201cat risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages\u201d and could claim the lives of much larger numbers of patients than now.\n\nAccording to official estimates, there were 52,971 antibiotic-resistant infections recorded across the UK in 2015 and 2,172 deaths that were due to the person developing such an infection. In addition almost 80 disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people in England were lost to antibiotic-resistant infections. That captures the number of years in which someone has suffered poor health or disability, or died earlier than expected.\n\nAmong European countries the UK ranks 13th for the number of disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 people.\n\nPHE also believes that pandemic flu, declining numbers of people having recommended vaccinations and health inequalities are other threats to health over the next few years.\n\nCelia Ingham Clark, NHS England\u2019s medical director for clinical effectiveness, said: \u201cAs part of the long-term plan the NHS will reduce the use of antibiotics by a further 15% to keep them as effective as possible, for example by offering patients access to new treatments.\u201d", "description": "Scientists in UK identify growing trend that threatens to leave patients untreatable", "authors": ["Denis Campbell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ad9424c30e580fdc638c52ef7cd200e61ad6e07/0_196_4240_2544/master/4240.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b613ea92545b304d487dba2a7923b096", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
