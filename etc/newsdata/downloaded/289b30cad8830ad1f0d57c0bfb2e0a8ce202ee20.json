Bayer Leverkusen They've lost Julian Brandt, but in Jonathan Tah, Leon Bailey and particularly Kai Havertz possess some of the best young talent in Germany. They'll be in the Round of 16 mix.

The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw.

Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nMadrid had looked home and dry at half-time, as a sublime Karim Benzema double strike and Casemiro close range effort had them 3-0 ahead. But a familiar lack of organisation and focus throughout the team saw Levante get one back soon after the restart through Borja Mayoral, and then really get the Bernabeu worried when Gonzalo Melero made it 3-2 with a quarter hour remaining.\n\nZidane\u2019s side played with no discernible tactical shape through six frantic minutes of added time. Only a point blank save in added time from goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stopped Madrid letting slip a three goal advantage for the first time ever in La Liga history.\n\nHalf an hour afterwards, the Frenchman was keen to claim that his team had actually put in a performance on which they could build for the rest of the season.\n\n\u201cThe second half was a bit more difficult for us, as the game changes when a team scores after three minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the feelings are positive as we got the three points, and played phenomenal in the first half, with goals, quality, commitment. We need to play like that for 90 minutes. We know we must improve, and we are going to improve. We must play better, for longer periods in the game, score more goals and concede fewer. And that is what will happen.\u201d\n\nHanging over the situation, left unsaid, was how Madrid\u2019s strange summer transfer window is now conditioning Zidane\u2019s selection decisions. The former galactico\u2019s single-minded pursuit of Paul Pogba was unsuccessful, because Blancos president Florentino Perez was never convinced that Pogba was worth Manchester United\u2019s \u00a3150 million plus asking price.\n\nThere was also contact between Madrid\u2019s hierarchy and people around Tottenham playmaker Christian Eriksen and Ajax\u2019s dynamic Donnie van der Beek. But Zidane apparently did not want either to arrive and block any move for Pogba. Meanwhile other potentially useful midfield options Marcos Llorente, Dani Ceballos, Martin Odegaard and Mateo Kovacic were moved on. So the transfer window closed with just four specialist midfielders in the squad, even though their coach\u2019s preferred shape is a 4-3-3.\n\nThe squad make-up was a talking point both before and after Saturday\u2019s game, when there were familiar whistles from a Bernabeu crowd not convinced by the team\u2019s start to the season. Eight points from four games has Zidane\u2019s side third in the early standings, two behind surprise leaders Sevilla, and sandwiched between presumed title rivals Atletico and Barcelona. But apart from an impressive 3-1 win at Celta Vigo on opening day, the performances have not been convincing in draws with Valladolid and Villarreal and almost slip against Levante.\n\nThe summer\u2019s transfer dealings were also a major theme of Madrid\u2019s club AGM on Sunday, and directly addressed by Perez in his prepared marks to selected socios.\n\n\u201cThis summer, Real Madrid has made a real effort in something very difficult, which is improving a winning squad made up of extraordinary players which are already part of our club\u2019s history,\u201d said the construction magnate. \u201cThis club has undertaken great financial efforts to renew and strengthen our wonderful squad, one of the most valuable in the world. We\u2019ve brought in six new players, reinforcing every element of the team. Among them, Eden Hazard, one of the best players in the world who has brought hope to madridismo. Alongside him Luka Jovic, Ferland Mendy, Eder Militao, James and Rodrygo have come in, as well as goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, who arrived to replace our dear Keylor Navas.\u201d\n\nPerez\u2019s speech also pointed out that \u201cMadrid are still the Club World Champions, as we have been since 18 December 2016, that\u2019s, 1,001 successive days\u201d. As always he talked a lot about the importance of values and unity. And he proudly pointed out that \u201cReal Madrid is the most valuable sports club in the world according to Forbes\u201d. In response to a question from the floor.\n\nAt a behind closed doors meeting with senior club socios last week Perez was somewhat more open. He claimed to have tried to sign Pogba last summer but \u201csome players are just not for sale\u201d. Asked why Madrid does not have a specific sporting director role, the construction magnate confirmed that director general Jose Angel Sanchez [a marketing professional who previously worked at Sega] headed the club\u2019s transfer department.\n\nZidane himself has made a concerted public effort to state he is content with the squad he has, even claiming to be delighted to still have previously discarded Gareth Bale and James available to choose from. \u201cIf I was not happy with these players I should look for another job,\u201d he said when the transfer window shut. \u201cMy players are always the best for me\u201d. But his views on the summer\u2019s transfer dealings can be surmised from how his XI on Saturday was again made up completely of players at the club last year.\n\nA positive for Madrid was Hazard finally making his official debut, after recovering from a thigh muscle injury picked up pre-season. The \u20ac100 million signing from Chelsea entered from the bench with the score at 3-1, and almost immediately got his first goal with a driving run and shot from 20 yards which was well saved by Levante keeper Aitor Fernandez. But he was also then one of the players looking unsure of his role when the team was all at sea during the closing stages.\n\nEven with defenders Sergio Ramos and Nacho Fernandez both suspended for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League Group A opener at Paris Saint Germain, Zidane will be unable to stiffen his midfield. Neither Modric nor Valverde will be available, meaning a shift to 4-2-3-1 is likely with Kroos and Casemiro paired together, and Bale, Hazard and Lucas in a line behind Benzema.\n\nAny further midfield injuries or suspensions would really hurt as Madrid begin what already looks a key phase of their season. Levante on Saturday was the first of seven games in 21 days before the next international break \u2013 including very dangerous away La Liga games at Sevilla [next Sunday] and neighbours Atletico.\n\nZidane is not a coach used to having to deal with such \u201ccircumstances\u201d. It is a moot point whether he or Perez is most responsible for the team\u2019s lack of midfield resources. But the next few weeks will test how he and his squad can \u201cadapt\u201d to the situation.", "description": "\u201cWhen I looked at the bench, that was all there was,\u201d said Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane. \u201cWe have to adapt with what we have.\u201d Zidane was speaking in the Bernabeu press room, after being asked to explain what happened to his team\u2019s midfield as they almost blew a 3-0 lead at home to Levante in Saturday\u2019s La Liga lunchtime kick-off.", "authors": ["Dermot Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/07/zidane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
