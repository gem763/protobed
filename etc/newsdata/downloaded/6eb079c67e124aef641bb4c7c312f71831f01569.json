The three aforementioned categories accounted for 421, 652, and 377 crimes committed by \u201canti-national elements\u201d respectively.\n\nRepresentational Image/BCCL\n\nDon't Miss 358 SHARES 3.3 K SHARES 2.5 K SHARES 5 K SHARES 3.8 K SHARES\n\nAccording to the NCRB data, the maximum offences were committed by Left Wing Extremists (LWEs) (652), followed by North East insurgents (421) and Terrorists or Jihadi and other elements (371).\n\nLWE operatives were found to be responsible for 82 killings according to the report, while terrorists were responsible for 36 deaths. Meanwhile, northeast insurgents killed 10 people.\n\nLWE insurgents caused 72 deaths in Chhattisgarh, while 34 of the 36 deaths and 18 attempt to murder cases by terrorists were in Jammu and Kashmir alone.\n\nThe report also gives details of attacks by \u201canti-national elements\u201d in 2017. As many as 269 civilians and police/state/army personnel were killed in these attacks in 2017.\n\nScreengrab/The new chapter listed in the index of the report.\n\nThe NCRB report included 88 new categories including sexual harassment of women at the workplace/public transport, offences relating to elections, obscene acts at public places, circulation of fake news, chit funds, cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and Mental Health Act, noise pollution and defacement of public property \u2013 also from adding \u201canti-national elements\u201d and \u201cjihadi terrorists\u201d.\n\nSince the BJP government came to power in 2014 and for the second tern in 2019, the term \"anti-national\" has been frequently used by prime minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers of the ruling regime. It has been increasingly used in the country ever since the arrests of student leaders of Jawaharlal Nehru University early in 2016. In the current (rather loose) context, it may define anyone who disagrees with the popular \"nationalist\" narrative and is insufficiently patriotic per the BJP and its supporters.", "description": "After a delay of two years, the National Crime Records Bureau finally published its annual report on crime statistic in the country for 2017.
