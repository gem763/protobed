When those failed, many responded to treatment with supplemental oxygen and steroids.\n\n\u2018ENDED UP IN AGONY\u2019\n\nIn addition to flu, many respiratory infections, including fungal infections, can cause symptoms that could confound doctors and delay a vaping diagnosis.\n\nThe University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City has treated 22 patients with vaping injuries, including Jeffrey Manzanares, 33, who was also infected with a cold and human metapneumovirus that led to pneumonia.\n\nManzanares first sought treatment at a local hospital on Sept. 3, where he was given an antibiotic and oxygen for his pneumonia and sent home, his vaping injury undetected, he said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cI ended up in agony from the lack of oxygen. It felt like someone was stabbing a knife into my whole body,\u201d he said.\n\nHe went to the University of Utah Hospital the next day, where he spent 21 days, including 17 in intensive care. During his illness, Manzanares said he lost 50 pounds (22.7 kg), a third of his normal body weight.\n\n\u201cHe was wildly sick,\u201d said Dr. Scott Aberegg, a pulmonologist who treated Manzanares. \u201cIf that is any harbinger of what is to come in viral pneumonia season, this could be very problematic.\u201d\n\nAberegg participated in a conference call earlier this month with other doctors advising the CDC on how clinicians should diagnose and manage vaping patients.\n\nHe said many doctors who get back a positive flu test may just assume the patient has the flu and not realize they are also a vaper.\n\nState health officials are on alert.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure to investigate all cases that are reported and make sure we don\u2019t miss anything that may be thought of as flu or may be associated with vaping or vice versa,\u201d Dr. Pam Pontones, Indiana\u2019s deputy health commissioner and state epidemiologist, said in a phone interview.\n\nInfluenza can be deadly in people who have other underlying illnesses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that anyone, but especially people who have underlying pulmonary infections of any kind, be vaccinated for influenza,\u201d Pontones said.\n\nThe CDC recommends everyone over the age of six get a flu shot.", "description": "U.S. health officials are preparing to release new guidance for doctors stressing the need to ask every patient with an apparent respiratory infection about their vaping history.", "authors": ["Julie Steenhuysen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439367936&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991WE", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
