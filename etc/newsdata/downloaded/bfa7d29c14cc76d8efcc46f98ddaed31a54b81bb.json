The newest model of the Echo Dot, the smallest of Amazon\u2019s Alexa-enabled smart home devices, now has an LED display right on the speaker that shows the time, outdoor temperature, or a timer.\n\nThe All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is now the perfect nightstand companion. You can do all the classic stuff that the original Echo Dot can do, like voice control your lights, check the weather, or read the news. The addition of the LED display adds another layer of practicality to an already practical device. This allows you to set an alarm like you would a traditional alarm clock but you have Alexa right there to give you info on what your day has in store for you. It\u2019ll help streamline your routine even more by giving you all your needed information in one place. It\u2019s priced at $60 and available for pre-order right now, with a release date of 10/16. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
