(Youssef Boudlal/Reuters)\n\nA Moroccan court has sentenced a journalist and her fiance to jail for having premarital sex and an alleged abortion, a punishment that human rights activists say is a blow to women\u2019s rights and part of a crackdown on independent reporting.\n\nIn sentencing Hajar Raissouni to one year in prison on Monday, a court in the Moroccan capital, Rabat, convicted her of having an \u201cillegal abortion and sexual relations outside of marriage.\u201d The court also convicted her Sudanese fiance, Rifaat al-Amin, sentencing him to a year in prison for helping Raissouni get the alleged abortion.\n\nThe doctor who allegedly performed the operation received two years in prison and a ban on practicing medicine for two years. Two other members of his medical staff received a one-year sentence and an eight-month sentence respectively. They were all arrested in late August at a gynecologist\u2019s clinic in Rabat.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is a devastating blow for women\u2019s rights in Morocco,\u201d Heba Morayef, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a statement. \u201cUnder international law, women have a right to make their own decisions about their sexual and reproductive lives. Criminalizing abortion is a form of discrimination against women.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old journalist and her defense lawyers denied that she had an abortion and said in a Sept. 4 letter that the charges were fabricated. She had gone to the doctor to receive treatment for internal bleeding, they said. Her arrest has triggered public protests by activists.\n\nRaissouni and human rights groups said her arrest was politically motivated. As a journalist for the independent Akhbar al-Yaoum newspaper, Raissouni wrote about anti-government protests in northern Morocco. The paper is one of the few remaining dailies that report critically on the government.\n\n\n\nDemonstrators protest the trial of Hajar Raissouni, a Morrocan journalist of the daily newspaper Akhbar al-Yaoum, in Marrakesh on Sept. 9, 2019.

Her cousin heads the Moroccan Association of Human Rights, the nation\u2019s largest independent human rights organizations.\n\nIn court, the government prosecutor denied that the case was motivated by Raissouni\u2019s critical reporting, adding that the clinic she visited was under surveillance for suspicion of performing illegal abortions. Her defense lawyer, Abdelmoula El Marouri, told Reuters that Raissouni and Amin were \u201cshocked by the verdict\u201d and that all the evidence should have led to an acquittal. They will appeal the verdict, he said.\n\n\u201cHajar Raissouni is being charged for alleged private behavior that shouldn\u2019t be criminalized in the first place,\u201d Ahmed Benchemsi, regional communications director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cMorocco\u2019s arrest, prosecution and brutal violation of Hajar Raissouni\u2019s private life illustrate the country\u2019s lack of respect of individual freedoms, and apparently the selective enforcement of unjust laws to punish critical journalism and activism.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The court gave Hajar Raissouni and her fiance each a year in prison in what activists called a blow to women\u2019s rights and independent reporting.", "authors": ["Sudarsan Raghavan", "Cairo Bureau Chief Covering North Africa", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nXrHPdi5w6TX7kGPudD7HiY8nnA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BHFSJZXEJMI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
