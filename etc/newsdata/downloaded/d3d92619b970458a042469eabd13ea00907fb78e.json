Milaski was jailed on charges of battery and false imprisonment, with bond set at $125,000.\n\nA judge later ordered him released on his own recognizance, agreeing with an emergency defense motion that described Milaski as a \u201chigh-achieving student,\u201d according to local outlet WCJB. The bail-reduction motion said Milaski is \u201cslated to graduated in May 2020\u2033 with a double major, and \u201cpersonally performed more than 210 hours of community service in the last two years.\u201d\n\nAlachua County Sheriff Ian Milaski's mugshot.\n\nMilaski\u2019s motion also argued that he needed to help his parents prepare for Hurricane Dorian and tend to his double major as a senior about to graduate, according to The Alligator, the UF student newspaper.\n\nThe woman, identified only as a UF sophomore, told officers that Milaski called her drunkenly and said he needed water on the night of Aug. 25, according to a police report. She said she walked Milaski back to his room, but he kept trying to make out with her despite her protests. After she continued to refuse his advances, he reportedly grabbed her by the wrists and said, \u201cI want to sleep with you.\u201d\n\nWhen the woman tried to leave Milaski\u2019s room, he grabbed her, picked her off the floor and pinned her on his bed, where he attempted to \u201cfinger her\u201d through her underwear, according to the police report, obtained by NBC-2.\n\nThe young woman told police she eventually escaped and returned to her dorm room. Later that night, she awoke in her bed and found Milaski trying to lie next to her. A friend of the woman who had been sleeping in the dorm room woke up from the commotion and yelled at Milaski to leave, according to the report.\n\nMilaski\u2019s bail motion explained the incident as a \u201cmisunderstanding among platonic friends fueled by alcohol,\u201d the Alligator reported.\n\nThe judge, whose name isn\u2019t mentioned in local news reports about the case, ordered Milaski to have no contact with the victim and banned him from returning to Sarasota and Alachua counties, where the university is located, except for court appointments or events related to school, including classes.\n\nMilaski also was ordered to wear a GPS monitor. No date has been set for his next court appearance.", "description": "University of Florida senior Ian Milaski, accused of battery and false imprisonment, was released on his own recognizance to await trial.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77bd133b0000c49fd0c547.jpeg?cache=h9y7vopmad&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
