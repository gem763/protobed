If Kurdish forces did not retreat, Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to fall back. \"And remaining Kurdish formations would then fall under the weight of the Turkish army,\" he said.\n\nIn a swipe at Washington, which has called into question how the deal will be guaranteed, Peskov said the United States had been the closest ally of the Kurdish fighters but had now betrayed them.\n\n\"Now they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks,\" he said in remarks to Russian news agencies.\n\nThe Kurdish-led SDF were Washington's main allies in the fight to dismantle Islamic State's self-declared caliphate in Syria. Trump's decision to pull troops out was criticized by U.S. lawmakers, including fellow Republicans, as a betrayal.\n\nIn a further sign of growing ties between Ankara and Moscow, which have alarmed the U.S. administration, the head of Russia's defense sales agency was quoted by the Interfax news agency on Wednesday as saying Moscow could deliver more S-400 missile defense systems to Turkey.\n\nTurkey, a NATO member, has already been frozen out of a program to buy and help produce F-35 jets and faces possible U.S. sanctions for buying the S-400 systems, which Washington says are incompatible with NATO's defenses and threaten the F-35 if operated near the stealth fighter.\n\nOvernight, Turkey's defense ministry said that the United States had told Ankara the YPG had completed its withdrawal from the area of Turkey's military offensive.\n\nThere was no need to initiate another operation outside the current area of operation at this stage, the ministry said, effectively ending its military offensive that began two weeks ago, drawing widespread criticism.\n\n(Writing by Dominic Evans; Editing by Gareth Jones)", "description": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia warned Syrian Kurdish YPG forces on Wednesday they face further armed conflict with Turkey if they fail to comply with a Russian-Turkish accord calling for their withdrawal from the entire length of Syria's northeastern border with Turkey.", "authors": ["Andrew Osborn"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
