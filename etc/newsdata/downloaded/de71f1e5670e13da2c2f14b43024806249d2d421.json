USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Ted Lerner was talking to all Washington Nationals fans when he told them \"This is for you\" from a makeshift stage behind second base in the moments after the nonagenarian's team won their first pennant.\n\nThe 43,976 in front of him, though, had just witnessed history \u2014 and roared back with approval of what they'd seen Tuesday. A seven-run first inning made Game 4 a laugher early that turned into a tightrope, but the Nationals prevailed over the St. Louis Cardinals 7-4.\n\n\"Often bumpy roads lead to beautiful places,\" Martinez told a still-packed stadium, undeterred by the threat of a closing Metro system. \"And this is a beautiful place.\"\n\nFans disembarked trains more than four hours before first pitch. Some went to bars, some milled about the neighborhood. The first fan in line at the center field gate was Rick Tameris, sporting a Santa hat and white beard.\n\nFireworks go off as the Washington Nationals celebrate their win over the St. Louis Cardinals in game four of the 2019 NLCS playoff baseball series at Nationals Park.

For this Nationals team, it can feel like it works the other way around, Nationals fan Travis Eagleson said.\n\n\"If the players get excited, we get excited,\" he said. \"If that\u2019s what they\u2019re about, that\u2019s what we\u2019re about.\"\n\nEagleson was in attendance with friend Brad Calandre, and both were wearing shark costumes, inspired by reserve outfielder Gerardo Parra's \"Baby Shark\" walk-up song that's been embraced en masse this season.\n\n\u201cOur fans stay in it, just like the players fight back,\u201d Calandre said, invoking the team's postseason mantra \"Stay In the Fight.\"\n\nAnything more wild than a ballpark full of adults and children alike singing \"Baby Shark?\" pic.twitter.com/buK6yJQfKj \u2014 Cut4 (@Cut4) October 16, 2019\n\nWhen Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina took his time rounding the bases on his solo homer in the fourth, boos turned to cheers when whoever caught the ball in the left-center field seas threw it back.\n\nThe crowd pleaded with Daniel Hudson to escape a bases loaded jam in the eighth, and when he did, they didn\u2019t sit back down until they left the ballpark.\n\nFans in D.C. celebrated a Capitals championship in 2018, and the Washington Mystics captured the WNBA title over the weekend.\n\nWill the winning continue in the nation's capital?\n\n\"You've got the Caps who have won. You've got the Mystics,\" Tameris said. \"Now, let's have baseball and see the Nats come up with a World Series win.\"\n\nDenise Vee, 23, has worked as an usher at the stadium for four years and has become a diehard Nationals fan in the process.\n\nThat much was evident when fans began piling out of her section, 134, right behind the first base dugout. Vee screamed at the top of her lungs for at least 10 minutes straight and high-fived every individual as they exited. She takes pride is among the most lively in Nationals Park.\n\n\"Amp them up when they're going down the steps, make sure they're prepared for the rest of the evening,\" she said.\n\n\"My voice is demolished for tomorrow,\" Vee said. \"We're all a family now. The chemistry is amped up. We're gonna make it all the way through.\"\n\nBrad Brenneman and his 18-year-old daughter, Lauren, had driven from Lovettsville, Virginia, for Tuesday's game.\n\n\"I can't believe it,\" Brenneman told her. \"But persistence is everything.\"", "description": "With the Washington Nationals heading to their first World Series, their fans proved Tuesday they are ready  for more in October.", "authors": ["Chris Bumbaca", "Published A.M.
