Coal and nuclear usage fell, while renewables and natural gas rose, AGEB noted.\n\nPositive factors for energy use, such as population growth and cooler weather than a year earlier, limited the extent of the decline.\n\nUse of imported hard coal shrank by 18.4% and that of domestic brown coal by 21.7% in the nine months, because steelmakers and working power plants used less feedstock amid maintenance standstills and reduced mining. Some brown coal generation plants were shut under environmental laws.\n\nRenewable energy usage increased by 4% from solar, wind and hydro sources, while that from biomass remained unchanged.", "description": "German energy usage should fall 2.3% in 2019 to a more than 40-year low, due to efficiency measures, a slowing economy and a structural change toward service industries, data from industry group AGEB showed on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Vera Eckert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
