This is something very strange,\u2019\" he said on Sunday.\n\n\"And when you say that, folks on Fox come after you. I remember the Tony\u2019s when you got up there and cursed,\" host Brian Stelter began.\n\n\"F**k em, f**em,\" De Niro interjected.\n\n\"Well, you know, this is cable so it\u2019s not an FCC violation, but it is still a Sunday morning, but it is still a Sunday morning,\" Stelter said. \"Why do you choose to go this way?\"\n\n\"We are in a moment in our lives \u2014 in this country where this guy is like a gangster.
