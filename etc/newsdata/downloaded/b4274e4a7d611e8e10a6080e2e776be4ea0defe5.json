The corporate business' EBITDA also increased by over AU$37 million to AU$367 million, an 11% jump.\n\nSee also: Vodafone Australia and TPG head to court for merger approval\n\nWhile TPG's Australian mobile network has been abandoned for now, it said its Singaporean mobile network is still progressing well, with around 300,000 users having signed up to trial the service for free until commercial launch.\n\nOutdoor service coverage in Singapore reached 99.7% in July.\n\nIt also launched free unlimited roaming for Singaporean users in Malaysia and Indonesia, with free roaming to be expanded to India later this month.\n\nTPG is set to go to court later this month to overturn the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's decision to refuse its merger with Vodafone.\n\nSpeaking to the upcoming court case, Banfield continued to express the same sentiment TPG has shared previously, saying the merger will be the best outcome for consumers, competition, telecommunications markets, and TPG shareholders.\n\nIf the two telcos are allowed to merge, it would see Vodafone Australia CEO Inaki Berroeta serve as CEO and Teoh as chair, and would produce revenue of AU$6 billion, EBITDA of AU$1.8 billion, and have an operating free cash flow of AU$900 million.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nACCC opposes TPG and Vodafone Australia merger\n\nConsumer watchdog rejects deal to create new telco worth AU$15 billion.\n\nTPG is still king of NBN speed report\n\nTPG still delivers on its download speed promises the most often, while Exetel won on upload speeds, Telstra on latency, and Optus on the highest number of daily outages, according to the fifth ACCC report.\n\nTPG quarterly profit drops 76 percent after Huawei ban\n\nWhile the mobile network abandonment brought down TPG's Q1 results, the telco also made less revenue thanks to the broadband market erosion caused by the NBN rollout.\n\nHuawei ban sees TPG end rollout of Australian mobile network\n\nAustralian telco says the lack of a clear upgrade path to 5G will see it end its network rollout.", "description": "The company expects FY20 to be the peak year for experiencing market erosion from the NBN rollout.", "authors": ["Campbell Kwan"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/18/76857e22-3f00-11e4-b6a0-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/c0da1f09d2c8ff17b1839f57b75911c8/tpg-defends-broadband-ads-in-high-court.jpg"}
