Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!\u201d tweeted Mr. Trump.\n\nMark Zaid, the attorney representing the first whistleblower, told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos that a second intelligence official has spoken to the Inspector General, and that this person has \u201cfirst-hand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint,\u201d according to ABC.\n\nThe first so-called second hand information \u201cWhistleblower\u201d got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another \u201cWhistleblower\u201d is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 6, 2019\n\nBREAKING: Second whistleblower comes forward after speaking with inspector general, attorney tells @ABC News. https://t.co/W5577DBwa1 \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) October 6, 2019\n\nThe New York Times reported Friday that a second whistleblower was weighing whether to file a complaint, although Mr. Zaid said he did not know whether the report referred to his client.\n\nThe first complaint, dated Aug. 12 and released Sept. 26, has been criticized for relying on second-hand information about the president\u2019s July 25 conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden over his involvement in the Ukraine related to his son.\n\nMr. Biden bragged in 2015 that he got a Ukrainian prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold foreign aid. His son Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian energy company in 2014.\n\n\u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d said Mr. Trump in the transcript released by the White House. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
