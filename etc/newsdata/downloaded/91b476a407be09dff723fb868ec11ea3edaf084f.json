When two large affordable housing communities, both more than 43 years old and in need of significant renovation became available, it was another example of the challenges in maintaining safe and quality affordable housing for the long term.\n\nThe acquirer and developer, Related Companies, had to work diligently to obtain all of the financing tools needed to purchase, redevelop and preserve 409 units of affordable housing in the Avondale and Alms Hills Apartment properties.\n\n\u201cWe were able to provide an all-encompassing financing solution to redevelop the properties, preserve the long-term affordability and improve the quality of the properties and lives of the residents,\u201d says Robert Likes, the national director of community development lending and investment at KeyBank Real Estate Capital.\n\nBetween the two developments, KeyBank provided $21 million in Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) equity, $38 million in construction financing and $28 million in Fannie Mae M-TEB forward-commitments. The tax-exempt bonds were issued by the Ohio Housing Finance Agency. KeyBanc Capital Markets (KBCM) underwrote the publicly offered tax-exempt bonds.\n\n\u201cThere are so many different types of innovative financing options we can provide,\u201d Likes explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cookie cutter approach.\u201d\n\nDevelopers and owners currently in this sector or those looking to expand in it need to consider the financing options carefully\u2014and they need a committed banking partner to help them do it.\n\nNo place to call home\n\nAccording to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, 11 million households\u2014roughly a quarter of all renters in the United States\u2014spend more than half of their income on housing. The definition of affordable housing, meanwhile, is housing that costs no more than 30% of one\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cAffordable housing provides stability in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Likes says. \u201cIf you\u2019re spending more than 30% of your income on housing, you don\u2019t have money for a lot of other important necessities.\u201d\n\nThere is now a shortage of 7.2 million affordable and available rental units for extremely low-income renters, reports the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The lowest income households, those living below the poverty level or earning 30% or less of their area\u2019s median income (AMI), face the most severe shortages. And yet, three-quarters of this population have difficulty accessing housing assistance.\n\nWhile extremely low-income households face the biggest shortage, even families with more means are feeling the housing squeeze since prices have soared over the last decade. The problem is widespread.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a housing crisis in big cities, in small cities and in rural communities,\u201d explains Likes.\n\nStephanie Hoopes, national director of the ALICE Project at the United Way of Northern New Jersey, notes that \u201chousing is usually the most expensive line item for most families. The shortage of affordable housing is on a magnitude that people aren\u2019t even working on.\u201d\n\nThe ALICE Project, which stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained Employees, is a bi-annual report measuring the financial struggles of working, low-income families.\n\nLess money, fewer houses\n\nIt\u2019s hard to square an affordable housing crisis with a robust economy. And yet both realities co-exist. While there\u2019s been tremendous growth in many industries, booming wages for highly skilled workers haven\u2019t filtered down to low-wage sectors like leisure, retail and hospitality. Pay for these workers hasn\u2019t kept pace with the rising cost of living.\n\n\u201cThe housing situation has gotten worse because the demand has surged,\u201d says Mark Stivers, the former executive director of the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t built enough new units.\u201d\n\nBecause higher wage workers can afford a wider range of housing, when there\u2019s a shortage they can edge out renters with fewer resources. Housing that was once deemed \u201caffordable\u201d is getting snapped up by people earning well above the AMI.\n\n\u201cEven as we continue to build more units, the population continues to grow and create demand that outpaces our efforts.,\u201d explains Alexander Beaumariage, program manager and senior vice president with KeyBank Real Estate Capital.\n\nPublic officials continue to recognize the importance of developing and preserving affordable housing units, by introducing new laws to ease zoning requirements and provide additional benefits to affordable housing developers.\n\nThe public-private fix\n\nThere is no single solution that can address the dire need for more affordable housing, says Likes. However, government and developers are the key to finding workable options. Each side brings something to the table that helps the other deliver more affordable housing units.\n\nFor example, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is a federal subsidy to finance the construction or rehabilitation of affordable rentals. The program gives investors 10 years of dollar-for-dollar reductions of their federal taxes in exchange for developing low-income rental units. The program provides the critical resources needed to develop and preserve affordable housing.\n\nWhile attempts to expand the program to keep pace with housing needs have stalled, Likes says KeyBank is working with clients and other industry leaders to help create innovative and flexible solutions.\n\nBalancing mission and margin\n\nUnder the Community Reinvestment Act, banks must provide lending to low- and moderate-income communities in the geographic areas where they are taking deposits. Depending on how well they comply with this requirement, banks are assigned an \u201coutstanding,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d \u201cneeds to improve\u201d or \u201csubstantial non-compliance\u201d rating.\n\nWith nine \u201coutstanding\u201d CRA ratings over 30 years, KeyBank has been on a mission to grow its affordable housing capability beyond its current 15-state footprint. \u201cA couple of years ago we saw an opportunity to grow and scale the affordable housing team and take it to a national level,\u201d says Likes.\n\nTo make good on that promise, KeyBank employs a number of financing solutions. So far, the results have been impressive. Since launching the expanded initiative in 2015, the program has grown by nearly 600%. KeyBank is now the fourth largest affordable housing lender in the country.\n\nThere\u2019s no easy fix for the affordable housing shortage. However, when financial institutions, developers and government work together, they can make significant progress toward a solution. These collaborative efforts are making a difference in dealing with the housing shortage\u2014and they\u2019re improving lives along the way. But, we are a long way off from solving the crisis.\n\nLearn how KeyBank\u2019s Community Development Lending & Investment teams are making a difference in the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.\n\nThis piece is not intended to provide specific tax or legal advice.
