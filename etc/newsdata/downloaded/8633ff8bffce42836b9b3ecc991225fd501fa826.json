Luis Severino\u2019s tipping? Ask Larry. Aroldis Chapman\u2019s velo is down? Ask Larry. Sonny Gray can\u2019t pitch in the Bronx?\n\nWell, no one seemed to have the answer to that one. Just about everything else was referred to Larry.\n\nThere is an everyman quality about Larry Rothschild, who lived in Manhattan, took the subway virtually unrecognized \u2014 to and from work \u2014 and generally looked like a guy who just wanted to be left alone to do his job.\n\nBut the truth is, I have no idea what real effect Larry Rothschild, or any pitching or hitting coach, can have on the performance of a major league player, and I never have.\n\nGiven the chance, Larry Rothschild could no more have turned Kei Igawa into Sandy Koufax than my editors at Yahoo could turn me into F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nPoint out minor mistakes? Check. Try to nip a bad habit in the bud? Check. Perhaps identify a mechanical flaw that has crept into an otherwise finely honed delivery? Check.\n\nNew York Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild was Fired on Monday. (AP Photo/Lynne Sladky)\n\nStory continues\n\nBut either the ability is there, or it isn\u2019t. A coach can tweak it a bit, but he can\u2019t provide it.\n\nHe also can\u2019t prevent things like Dellin Betances tearing his Achilles tendon on a celebratory leap, or Domingo German allegedly assaulting the mother of his children at a team function in September.\n\nThe argument can be made that those two incidents doomed the Yankees\u2019 postseason run almost as much as Jose Altuve\u2019s walkoff home run.\n\nBy the way, Chapman and Gary Sanchez agreed that the correct 2-1 pitch to Altuve in that situation was a slider, Chapman\u2019s second-best pitch. Was that Rothschild\u2019s fault, too?\n\nThe point is not to say that Rothschild should have kept his job \u2014 sometimes, a staff just needs to hear a new voice, with a different philosophy \u2014 but that we all tend to over-credit managers and coaches when things go well, and over-blame them when things go wrong.\n\nThe Yankees won 103 games and the AL East this year, and then bombed out in the postseason, and someone has to take the fall. I get it. Coaches are hired, essentially, to take the blame when players fail to perform up to expectations.\n\nI also get why it was Rothschild, and not, say, Marcus Thames, the hitting coach. After all, even beset by injuries, the Yankees\u2019 offense led the AL in runs scored, was second in home runs and in the top three in on-base percentage and slugging percentage. Tough to justify firing a guy whose unit did that.\n\nAnd the truth is, the Yankees\u2019 staff ERA was 4.31 in 2019, the highest it has been since Rothschild took over the pitching in 2011 after Dave Eiland got fired. It also allowed the highest number of home runs, 248, of Rothschild\u2019s tenure.\n\nBut again, was that his fault? Or is it more easily attributed to the juiced baseball and the game\u2019s obsession with launch angle, exit velo and all-or-nothing hitters?\n\nAnd by the way, James Paxton, acquired last winter in a trade with Seattle, looked like Sonny Gray II for the first half of his first season in pinstripes. Then, he won his last 10 regular-season decisions, posted a 1.05 ERA in September and pitched a gem against the Astros in Game 5 of the ALCS.\n\nDoes Rothschild deserve any of the credit for turning his season around?\n\nCalls to Rothschild\u2019s cellphone went unanswered Monday, and GM Brian Cashman did not immediately return a call seeking a concrete reason for why it was determined that Larry had to pay for the Yankees\u2019 failure to get to the World Series.\n\nIn its place, the team put out a statement, attributed to Cashman \u2014 \u201cI want to personally thank Larry for his near decade of commitment to this organization. Larry cares deeply about his craft and the pitchers under his tutelage, and he played a significant role in our successes over the past nine seasons. There\u2019s a reason why Larry has had the type of distinguished baseball career he\u2019s had, and it starts with experience and dedication that is difficult to emulate\u201d \u2014 which only made you wonder why the Yankees got rid of him in the first place.\n\nThe fact is, both Cashman and Boone downplayed the need to go all-in on starting pitching this winter, even with Gerrit Cole, Madison Bumgarner, Zack Wheeler and possibly Stephen Strasburg on the market.\n\nMaybe Rothschild\u2019s successor, whoever that turns out to be, will get the benefit of working with one of them. And of course, take the blame if the Yankees fail to get to the ever-more elusive promised land.\n\nThat is a pitching coach\u2019s job. Really, is there anything more to it?\n\nI\u2019d have to ask Larry.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Yankees\u2019 pitching coach was fired Monday because, well, that\u2019s what happens in the bigs.", "authors": ["Wallace Matthews"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MYG4p5x3obUDl1XxyCQB.g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MTYuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/htc_ZUnhlDxF72.3maBuPQ--~B/aD0yOTI0O3c9NDA4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/c0ccf080-b105-11e9-abde-fecd0d240ce8", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
