There are no brakes on this freebie orgy. Delhi metro is the next stop. But while DTC fell in line without much protest because it is under the state government, DMRC is offering more robust resistance. There is great, and justified, scepticism about AAP sarkar\u2019s promises to fully reimburse lost revenue. Moreover, the free ride model doesn\u2019t make it to any global list of cities with the best public transportation, even as the Delhi metro is the envy of the rest of India and globally competitive. Don\u2019t fix the one thing that is world class; fix the many things that are broken in the city instead.\n\nIn its 2015 election manifesto AAP promised at least 5,000 new buses in five years. A budget speech later that year proposed 10,000 buses under the PPP cluster scheme. Yet, here we are, free rides have come but not all those new buses. Povertarian populism is a terrible substitute for infrastructure expansion. Under its remit, even well run enterprises will be ground down fast.\n\nIndia\u2019s female labour force participation rate has actually been declining despite economic and demographic conditions that should have led to its rise. One factor explaining this puzzle is that too many women just do not feel safe going to work. What women want is a safe and affordable commute. What good is a free pass when safe public transportation is not available even when women are willing to pay a premium for it? Like Delhi, bus fleet sizes have been stagnating in Kolkata, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai too. Bring the buses, women will pay for the rides.", "description": "It was telling that on the very day he launched the free-ride scheme for women on Delhi public buses, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it might be extended to senior citizens and all students.
