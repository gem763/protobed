She was held in solitary confinement.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself. He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder,\u201d Carl said, stressing a point somehow overlooked by certain media organizations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel,\u201d Carl concluded.\n\nHis wife Marsha lamented that not all of the details of Kayla\u2019s death have been revealed, including the precise circumstances of her death. The Islamic State claimed she was killed when Jordanian airstrikes on the ISIS \u201ccapital\u201d of Raqqa collapsed the building she was held prisoner in, but the Jordanians and U.S. military officials disputed that account, and few would be willing to absolve ISIS and Baghdadi of full responsibility for Kayla\u2019s death even if it was true.\n\n\u201cI still want to know, \u2018Where is Kayla?\u2019 and what truly happened to her and what aren\u2019t we being told. Someone knows, and I\u2019m praying with all my heart that someone in this world will bring us those answers,\u201d Marsha Mueller said.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful for them,\u201d she said of the American troops who carried out the Baghdadi raid and President Trump for giving the order. The Muellers expressed gratitude that no American soldiers were killed in the operation.\n\n\u201cI still say Kayla should be here, and if Obama had been as decisive as President Trump, maybe she would have been,\u201d Marsha added.\n\n\u201cHe knows her story. He\u2019s been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy,\u201d Carl said of Trump, expressing confidence that the U.S. military is \u201cgoing to get them all.\u201d\n\nThe Muellers were optimistic that the Trump administration would discover and reveal more details of Kayla\u2019s captivity and murder.\n\n\u201cI think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened,\u201d said Marsha.\n\nThe Muellers expressed similar sentiments in other interviews on Sunday and Monday. Carl Mueller told the local CBS News affiliate on Monday it was a \u201cshock\u201d to learn of Baghdadi\u2019s confirmed death at last after years of false reports about the elusive ISIS leader\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cOne minute you\u2019re sitting here watching a movie, and the next minute you get the news the man that raped and possibly murdered your daughter has been killed,\u201d he said.\n\nMarsha noted to CBS that Kayla\u2019s remains have never been recovered, so she cannot help nursing the faintest hope that her daughter might still be alive and lost in Syria. In any event, she said the Mueller family hopes to bring Kayla home.\n\n\u201cBecause of that one percent possibility, how do you completely give up until you have her home? We want Kayla home, and I know that sounds like an impossible task, but after what we\u2019ve been through, the things that pop up and happen I believe we might just find her,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe feel this is the moment,\u201d Carl said. \u201c[Baghdadi\u2019s] been killed, some of his lieutenants have been captured, and who else would know what happened to Kayla but these people close to him? Somebody, and it may be one of these people who were captured yesterday, knows what happened and know who killed her.\u201d\n\nMarsha Mueller told CNN on Sunday she and her husband were \u201cdeeply touched\u201d by President Trump\u2019s statement on Sunday, which mentioned Kayla Mueller by name.\n\n\u201cWe were grateful that they didn\u2019t mess around and went right in,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just want to say how grateful we are to this administration, to the military, and to the special forces that went in. My hope is that this will help us get answers to what really happened to Kayla and get her home,\u201d she said.\n\nCarl told ABC News on Sunday it was \u201cvery touching\u201d to learn the operation that took Baghdadi down was named after Kayla.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump mentioned her today in his statement and he mentioned that he deserved what he got for what he did to Kayla,\u201d Carl said. \u201cShe\u2019s not forgotten, and that\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nThe Muellers revealed during the ABC interview they once traveled to Iraq and met with Umm Sayyaf, the imprisoned wife of Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf, killed by U.S. special forces in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhen we talked to Umm Sayyaf, we found we got more information out of her, not just us, the people backing us \u2013 they got information from her that neither the Kurds or the US government had got in the two days that we were there,\u201d Carl said of the trip to Iraq.\n\n\u201cWe learned from women that were ransomed out by their governments that she said she was held in many cold, dark places, she was raped by al-Baghdadi, we know that to be a fact. She was murdered by him or someone in his organization. That\u2019s what we\u2019re pursuing and that\u2019s what we hope that President Trump will help us with,\u201d he said.", "description": "The parents of murdered American humanitarian worker Kayla Mueller thank President Trump for bringing justice to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/03/obama.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
