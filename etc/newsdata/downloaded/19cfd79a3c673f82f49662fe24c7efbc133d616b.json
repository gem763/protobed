Lindsey Graham called on the Justice Department to investigate \u201call things Ukraine\u201d Sunday amid controversy about a secretive whistleblower complaint likely regarding a phone call between President Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nThe South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said he was, \u201choping that the Department of Justice will look at the Biden-Ukraine connection the way that we looked at Trump-Russia connection\u201d in a Fox News interview, and called for DOJ to appoint an investigator. Graham also brought up Republican claims that Ukrainian officials tried helping Hillary Clinton win in 2016.\n\nBiden bragged in 2018 that, as vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani alleged for months that Biden wanted Shokin fired because Shokin reportedly undertook an anti-corruption investigation into Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma Holdings, which employed Joe Biden\u2019s lobbyist son Hunter as a board member starting in 2014, reportedly paying him $50,000 a month. The Biden camp countered that Shokin was widely seen by the U.S. and Europe \u2014 and inside Ukraine \u2014 as ineffective, corrupt, and a hindrance to Ukraine\u2019s progress. Ukraine\u2019s parliament removed Shokin in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe looked at all things Russia and Trump, his family, everything about his family, everything transaction between the Trump campaign and Russia. Now is time to see whether or not the Ukrainians released information regarding Paul Manafort, who was Trump\u2019s campaign manager,\" Graham said. \"What relationships, if any, did the Biden world have with the Ukraine? What role, if any, did the Ukraine play in the 2016 election?\u201d\n\n\n\nA whistleblower complaint deemed \u201cserious\u201d and \u201curgent\u201d by intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson was reportedly prompted by a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in July where Trump reportedly urged Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to the Ukrainian energy company.\n\nFormer Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the Washington Post the Burisma case was dormant before Shokin was fired, and Shokin's successor, Yuri Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News in May there wasn\u2019t any evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden family.\n\nThree Democrat-led committees are looking into whether Trump improperly pressured the Ukrainian government by withholding $250 million in aid to block Russian aggression unless they agreed to help Trump\u2019s reelection campaign by investigating the Bidens. That money was released earlier this month.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden rejected the notion that he pressured the Ukrainian government on behalf of his son, and said, \u201cI have never spoken with my son about his overseas business dealings.\u201d But Hunter Biden told the New Yorker in July he and his father spoke about his business foray in Ukraine once.\n\nBiden shot back on Saturday. \u201cI know Trump deserves to be investigated,\u201d he said, doubling down on his demand for Trump to release the call transcript in question.\n\nTrump defended the call as a \u201cperfectly fine and routine conversation.\u201d\n\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire declined to release the contents of the whistleblower complaint to Congress and will testify before House and Senate intelligence committees this week.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko on Saturday dismissed claims that Trump pressured Zelensky during the July call, saying, \u201cI know what the conversation was about, and I think there was no pressure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of allegations out there how the Ukraine fed information maybe to the Democrats and the Department of Justice against Trump campaign managers and others,\u201d Graham said on Sunday. \u201cAnd I think it's fair after what the Trumps have gone through regarding Russia that somebody looked at the connection of the Bidens \u2014 while the vice president was a sitting vice president \u2014 the Biden connection to the Ukraine through his son.\u201d\n\nBut in the same interview where Prystaiko denied Trump had improperly pressured Zelensky, he also denied Ukrainian involvement in helping Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cI think the situation that\u2019s taking place with the Americans between Ukraine and the U.S., this confrontation between Republicans and Democrats, all these speculations that Ukraine helped the Democrats, that we wanted President Clinton instead of President Trump, this is a result of misinformation and evil intentions of certain people,\u201d Prystaiko said this weekend.\n\nSerhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian journalist and activist who revealed in August 2016 a \u201cblack ledger\u201d purportedly showing secretive payments from pro-Russian former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to Manafort, denies he was trying to help Clinton.", "description": "Sen.
