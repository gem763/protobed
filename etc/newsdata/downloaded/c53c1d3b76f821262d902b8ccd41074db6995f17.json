But the fact is, [he] still pays more attention than the US administration demonstrated five years ago.\"\n\nRead more: Here's what China has at stake in Hong Kong, and how it could all unravel\n\nThe Hong Kong demonstrations began earlier this summer, after the city's government began debating a controversial extradition bill that would have allowed authorities in mainland China to extradite Hong Kong residents for criminal trials.\n\nThough Hong Kong's government has since withdrawn the bill after months of protests, activists said the move was \" too little, too late,\" and would press on with their demands that Hong Kong investigates incidents of police brutality against protesters, releases imprisoned activists, and holds fully democratic elections.", "description": "Activist Joshua Wong is set to meet with US lawmakers and testify before Congress on Tuesday about the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ebd732e22af03d01b2d13-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
