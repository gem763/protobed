Oil holds steady as Russia reaffirms commitment to output cuts TOKYO, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Monday,\n\nholding on to strong gains last week, after Russia affirmed its\n\ncommitment to a deal with OPEC producers to keep production in\n\ncheck and support prices.\n\nBrent crude was down 1 cent at $62.01 a barrel by\n\n0055 GMT, having logged a weekly gain of more than 4% last week,\n\nits best weekly gain since Sept. 20.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down\n\n4 cents at $56.62 a barrel, having risen more than 5% last week,\n\nalso the biggest weekly increase since Sept. 20.\n\nRussia's energy ministry said on Friday it is continuing\n\nclose cooperation with Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the\n\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC oil producers\n\nto enhance market stability and predictability. The statement came a day after Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian\n\noil producer, Rosneft , said the September attacks on\n\nSaudi oil assets created doubts over its reliability as a\n\nsupplier. The attacks temporarily shut down around half of the\n\nkingdom's oil output. \"(Russian) oil companies have wanted to get busy stealing\n\noil market share from the Saudis and others for a few years now\n\nbut ... Moscow has them in a bit of a box and is driving the\n\nbus,\" said Greg McKenna, strategist at McKenna Macro.\n\nOPEC+, an alliance of OPEC members and other major producers\n\nincluding Russia, has since January implemented a deal to cut\n\noutput by 1.2 million bpd to support the market.\n\nThe pact runs to March 2020 and the producers meet to review\n\npolicy on Dec. 5-6.\n\nPrices were also supported by a statement from the United\n\nStates and China that they are close to finalizing some parts of\n\na trade agreement after high level discussions. Elsewhere, a suggestion by U.S. President Donald Trump that\n\nExxon Mobil or another U.S. oil company could operate Syrian oil\n\nfields drew rebukes from legal and energy experts.\n\nOil holds steady as Russia reaffirms commitment to output cuts", "description": "Oil holds steady as Russia reaffirms commitment to output cuts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB7405M_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
