Hahahahahaha I LOVE that they get so irate,\u2019 Jodie mused on Twitter on Tuesday night.\n\n\u2018Like, why do they care when I put my decorations up?\u2019\n\nEh, she has a point.\n\nJodie continued: \u2018It genuinely amuses me that people get so angry. Me and Billy are like two pigs in sh*t over here at Marsh Manors. Enjoy folks.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt came after the 40-year-old posted some rather extravagant examples of how she\u2019s gone above and beyond this holiday season.\n\nThat\u2019s a big elf (Picture: Twitter)\n\nWe\u2019re talking train sets weaving their way around her loungeroom furniture, artificial snow \u2013 inside, no less, pah, she\u2019s creating her own indoor weather system \u2013 and a weird lifesize figurine of the villain from Saw that will most definitely make the average punter wet themselves if they go for a midnight water run.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Christmas in our house already. And that\u2019s all that matters really,\u2019 she wrote alongside more shots.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018The village is bigger and better this year! Feast your eyes on this delight.\u2019\n\nAs well as aforementioned train set, creepy Jigsaw character and fake snow, Jodie had also erected a \u2018posh\u2019 Christmas tree in the loungeroom with one giant, plush elf taking pride of place on an armchair.\n\nBilly\u2019s blue tree (Picture: Twitter)\n\nHere\u2019s hoping she doesn\u2019t have visitors in the next couple months, or poor Elf will be relegated to the floor.\n\nIt seemed she had got her boyfriend Billy Nuttall his own tree, too, with a blue sensation taking pride of place in another room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdorned with Harry Potter and Star Wars decorations, Jodie was going all out for the all-blue theme.\n\n\u2018The Star Wars and Harry Potter tree just for Billy (because he\u2019s obsessed with both) \u2013 still more to go on but this is a good start!!\u2019 she wrote.\n\nOf course it didn\u2019t take long for the fans to start wondering why on earth she was getting so excited for Christmas when there was over two months to go.\n\nSuppose this is why we\u2019re not allowed to have nice things?\n\n\u2018How long was I asleep for? I thought it was still October,\u2019 one trolled.\n\nAnother wasn\u2019t keen on being reminded of the passing winds of time, as they chimed in: \u2018Whhaaaattt?? Our first baby is due at Christmas and all the Christmas stuff in shops and now seeing you have a tree up is giving me anxiety.\u2019\n\n\u2018You realise it\u2019s October right!??,\u2019 while another added: \u2018Jodie, it\u2019s a bit early for this, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nSome suggested perhaps Jodie needs to think about a Halloween tree before Christmas, as they added: \u2018WTF it\u2019s only just turned October. Not even had Halloween or Bommy nights yet! Just wrong marsh!\u2019\n\nOh, deck the halls, we say!\n\nGot a showbiz story?
