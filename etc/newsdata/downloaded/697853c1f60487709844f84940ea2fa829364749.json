This past fortnight the throwing has been done exclusively by Varley.\n\nJoe Root is training with friend Josh Varley before England's November tour of New Zealand\n\nThe pair began with a couple of sessions at Collegiate's Abbeydale Park home and also took in an indoor session at Denstone College, where Root's ex-Yorkshire team-mate Simon Guy is head of cricket.\n\n'I do some brilliant work with Graham Thorpe, and guys like Mark Ramprakash when he was involved. But every now and again it's quite nice to go to other people and for someone like Josh an opportunity to help me will hopefully help him as a young coach,' Root said.\n\nDespite hitting four 50s, Root managed just 325 runs in five matches against the Australians, a poor return by his high standards and part of a longer-term decline which has seen his Test average plummet from 52.8 when he took over the captaincy in the summer of 2017 to under 48, its lowest point for more than five years.\n\nChris Silverwood will oversee his first Test as England coach in Tauranga next month\n\nROOT'S TEST CAREER Matches: 86 Innings: 159 Runs: 7043 Highest score: 254 Average: 47.91 50s: 45 100s: 16 Ducks: 8\n\nImplementing changes to stance and technique would have been nigh-on impossible in the heat of that battle, which concluded a three-and-a-half month period also including a World Cup-winning campaign and a Test match versus Ireland.\n\nBut he is hopeful the work away from the international spotlight will come to fruition on the two-Test tour of New Zealand next month.\n\n'I've just been lining things up slightly differently, to get a rhythm back into my batting without it affecting my balance, if you like,' he revealed.\n\nRoot's Test average has plummeted from 52.8 in the summer of 2017 to under 48\n\n'I felt sometimes I was getting a little bit too offside of the ball and then as though I was trying to fight that. When I bat well everything feels very rhythmical and that's what I am trying to find. Also if I am better aligned, I can access everywhere on the field a lot easier.\n\n'Four years ago is the last time I had a break as long as this and that was because I broke my thumb. So to have a block and a chance to spend some time working at certain technical things without the pressure of a game around the corner is invaluable, really.\n\n'You have to take these pockets of time as an opportunity to improve yourself.'", "description": "Joe Root has turned to a club coach and lifelong friend in his quest to rediscover his batting touch post-Ashes.\u00a0The 28-year-old enjoyed a family holiday in Greece before putting his pads on again.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20043492-0-image-a-12_1571761073995.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
