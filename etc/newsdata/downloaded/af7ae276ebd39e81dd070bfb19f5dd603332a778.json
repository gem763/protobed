The matchup was touted as one that would determine the UFC\u2019s best grappler between the wrestling and Brazilian jiu-jitsu specialists, and Askren\u2019s unwavering belief in himself directly into making a poor decision.\n\n\u201cWe had obviously trained so much back in camp; I had a really good jiu-jitsu guy,\u201d Askren said on the UFC on ESPN+ 20 post-fight show. \u201cI guess I was overconfident. I guess there\u2019s a reason why he\u2019s the best grappler in the division, possibly in MMA ever. I was fairly confident that I was gonna get the reversal, but I didn\u2019t, and I failed, and obviously that was the outcome.\u201d\n\nMade a bad decision and I failed. Sorry to everyone who I let down. \u2014 Ben Askren (@Benaskren) October 26, 2019\n\nThe early rounds saw Maia executing well in striking and tagging Askren with some good shots. Askren started to find a home for his takedowns as the bout wore on, and every time the action hit the ground the fighters produced exciting back-and-forth grappling exchanges.\n\nMaia ultimately capitalized on an advantageous position in the third round, securing the rear-naked choke and briefly putting Askren to sleep. \u201cFunky\u201d said he didn\u2019t think it would happen that way but pointed out how MMA is a game of inches and an error on his behalf led to the loss.\n\n\u201c(The fight went) kind of as we planned,\u201d Askren said. \u201cA couple of positions I would\u2019ve liked to have get, like a muay Thai clinch more, but he was able to stay out of that. But I was landing the punches I wanted to land. I was landing my uppercut really well. And then I was getting takedowns. I think I ended up with four or five takedowns. And then I made a really bad decision.\u201d\n\nAskren now has lost two-straight after staying undefeated through 19 career fights. The former Bellator and ONE Championship titleholder came to the UFC this year to prove he\u2019s the top welterweight fighter in the world, but the latest result takes him out of the discussion. At 35, critics will argue Askren\u2019s window is closed. However, he said he\u2019s not making any rash decisions about his future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know (what\u2019s next),\u201d Askren said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go home and sit down and talk about it and think about it. Obviously had a real busy year. It was fantastic. Even coming into this fight I\u2019m thinking, \u2018What\u2019s next? Who am I going to call out?\u2019 When I lost \u2013 everyone in the division is busy. A callout would be hard. There\u2019s no one that makes a whole lot of sense right away. With that being said, I\u2019ll probably wait and sit for a second and see what happens.\u201d", "description": "Ben Askren said he made a poor decision in the third round that led to Demian Maia choking him out.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-askren-ufc-singapore.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
