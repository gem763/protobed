The announcement comes as part of a broad new partnership between Disney and Verizon. Under the new deal, Verizon will become the exclusive US wireless carrier partner for Disney+.\n\nThe move should also help Disney secure immediate subscribers within the first year of the streaming service\u2019s launch, which is a crucial period for the company.
