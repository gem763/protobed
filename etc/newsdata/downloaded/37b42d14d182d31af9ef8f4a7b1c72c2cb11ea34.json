Writer Ravia Ratan posted on Twitter on Friday that there seems to be a glaring error in the company's Maps app. Where the app should be listing Dr BR Ambedkar Marg near Navi Mumbai, it instead displays 'Dhondu Ambedkar Marg'.\n\nHey @apple\n\nSome bigot at your company ( Probably an Indian Bigot) in Apple maps has mischievously renamed \u201cDr B R Ambedkar marg\u201d as \u201cDhondu Ambedkar\u201d marg ( a slur) near Navi Mumbai\n\nGoogle map shows correct name, why is Apple map showing this. Correct it now and take action. pic.twitter.com/6sidfzhWB3 \u2014 Ravi Ratan (@scribe_it) October 19, 2019\n\nFor those of you that don't know, \"Dhondu\" is actually a slur that propagates the subjugation of the Mahar people. These are a community of Dalits largely in Maharashtra and neighbouring areas that were designated a Scheduled Caste back in 2017. They value BR Ambedkar highly, having even followed him in converting to Buddhism decades ago.\n\nDon't Miss 6.3 K SHARES 131 SHARES 44.1 K SHARES 6.9 K SHARES\n\nDhondu was a common name given to men in this community, meaning \"small stone\". Mahar people were not allowed to do any work other than menial labour and were considered less than animals. Which is why they weren't allowed to have dignified or auspicious names.\n\nRatan has so far been attempting to contact Apple through Twitter to have them rectify the error, but there seems to have been no response so far. Of course, people are outraged.\n\nHowever, while most seem to think there are a few bigots at Apple responsible for this act, others imply it may simply be oversight on the company's part.\n\nIn any case, Apple can still certainly be blamed for not being alert enough to catch this after people are interacting in their Twitter mentions for three days now. Let's hope their social media team wakes up soon enough.\n\nBut it's not the first time online services like these have been tricked into defaming a person, and it certainly won't be the last. Back in 2018, Google was throwing up results with Sonia Gandhi featuring prominently, when searching for 'Bar girl in India'. Around the same time, a group of netizens also tricked Google search with a devoted campaign, searching for Donald Trump's name in relation to the word \"idiot\", so the two would begin showing up together.", "description": "It seems Apple Maps is responsible for one such transgression.
