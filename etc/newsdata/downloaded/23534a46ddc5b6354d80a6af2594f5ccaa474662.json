Courtesy: Afshin Ismaeili\n\n\u201cMy childhood was full of conflict and bombing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, I found that I had to do something. I had to show what I have been through and to stop it.\u201d\n\nThrough a series called Children of War, in September Ismaeli showcased his work at the Xposure International Photography Festival in the UAE emirate of Sharjah.\n\nUnforgettable photos\n\nIn recent decades, iconic examples of images with impact have included the \u2018Afghan Girl\u2019 taken by American photographer Steve McCurry in 1984, who met then 12-year-old Sharbat Gula at a refugee camp in Pakistan.\n\n\u2018The Afghan Girl\u2019, taken by National Geographic photographer, Steve Curry in 1984.\n\nHer piercing green eyes penetrated the hearts of people across the world and the impact of her photo inspired National Geographic to create a fund in her name.\n\nAnother haunting photograph from the archives is that of thee-year-old Alan Kurdi, whose lifeless body on a Turkish shore made global headlines.\n\nThe picture highlighted the plight of Syrian refugees during the European migrant crisis of 2015.\n\nSeeing the world through a different lens\n\nRealizing the power a single picture can have to bring important issues into focus, photography enthusiasts in the UAE are exploring ways to take their hobby to the next level.\n\n\u201cYou have to be very passionate about it to make this a business,\u201d says Bjoern Lauen, managing director of the UAE-based production company Awesome Group.\n\nLauen held a workshop at the Xposure International Photography Festival, teaching amateurs the moral responsibility of photography, plus the realities of the job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to endure periods of struggle, and hustle,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd periods where you wouldn\u2019t earn as much money as you probably would wish to.\u201d\n\nLauen says that it\u2019s not uncommon for some photojournalists to sell pictures for less than a dollar while getting started in the business.\n\nThe challenges of the industry haven\u2019t stopped Emirati Rashed Al Mazrouei from considering taking up the art form as a career.\n\nAfter travelling to Northern India\u2019s Ladakh region earlier this year, he said the simple life of residents there inspired him to consider photography full-time.\n\nPhotography enthusiast Rashed Al Mazrouei shows Euronews reporter Salim Essaid his photo from Ladakh, India.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby for me, just a passion right now, and hopefully I can turn this passion into a profession,\u201d says the HR specialist at Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\n\n\u201cMaybe one day I\u2019ll earn from photography and travel all over the world, meeting different cultures and new people.\u201d\n\nIn Mazrouei\u2019s sights is Sub-Saharan Africa, where using his camera, he says he\u2019s looking forward to clicking with more people.\n\nSEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA: A LOOK AT XPOSURE\n\nJenilyn from the Philippines saw the world through someone else\u2019s eyes upon a visit to Sharjah\u2019s Xposure photography exhibit.\n\nAnd time flew by for Midhun from India at the same event and left motivated to pick up a camera.", "description": "Capturing someone\u2019s life story in a single moment is what Oslo-based photographer Afshin Ismaeli does for a living.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/26/48/1000x563_cmsv2_e726ecf9-59ef-5088-9f86-5a054be978d6-4222648.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
