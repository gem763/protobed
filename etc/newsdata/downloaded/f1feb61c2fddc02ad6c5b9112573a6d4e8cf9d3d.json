Scalise About His Vote to Condemn Trump's Decision in Syria", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Steve Scalise spoke with Lou Doubs Wednesday evening regarding a foreign policy meeting he attended earlier with President Trump and congressional leaders, as well as his vote to condemn the Trump administration's decision to withdrawal troops from Syria.\n\nEarlier in the day, the House voted in favor of a resolution condemning President Trump for withdrawing troops from Syria. Rep. Scalise was one of the 129 Republicans who joined the Democrats to condemn the president\u2019s decision. A baffled Dobbs told the congressman, \u201cYou voted for it. I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\n\nWhile 129 Republicans joined with Democrats to condemn Trump\u2019s decision, 60 stood by the president.\n\nHere\u2019s the list of the 60 House Republicans who voted against \u201cOpposing the decision to end certain United States efforts to prevent Turkish military operations against Syrian Kurdish forces in Northeast Syria\u201d pic.twitter.com/Q8NuqZJG2o \u2014 Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) October 16, 2019\n\nDobbs explained, \u201cThe people who voted for him in 2016 voted for him with this promise on the table: That he was going to get our troops out of wars in which they did not belong, out of international police actions \u2013 precisely the description of, I think, northern Syria. Isn\u2019t it time to start following this president? I mean, I don\u2019t understand it. The Republicans \u2013 I would think you guys would say, \u2018you know Nancy Pelosi is for it, I sure as hell better be against it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Fox Business host then cited a recent Economist/YouGov poll showing 57 percent of Republicans support Trump\u2019s decision to withdrawal troops from Syria, and he asked Rep. Scalise if he feared retaliation from Republican voters for failing to stand with the president and joining with House Democrats to condemn Trump's decision?\n\nDobbs also questioned how Rep. Scalise could join Lindsey Graham who, as Dobbs characterizes, \u201cdoes not have a great skill and a great record in foreign policy?\u201d\n\nRep. Scalise appeared to give the same answer to each one of Dobbs\u2019 tough questions: emphasizing all the other areas in which he agrees with the president; criticizing Speaker Pelosi for storming out of today\u2019s meeting; and denouncing the closed-door impeachment inquiry going on in the House.", "description": "Rep.
