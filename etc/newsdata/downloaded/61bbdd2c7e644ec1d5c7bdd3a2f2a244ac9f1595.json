If you\u2019re truly someone who doesn\u2019t routinely miss payments they\u2019ll probably be able to waive the late fee. You have to specifically ask them for that. So you can\u2019t just call and say, \u201cHey, I missed my bill, is there anything you can do?\u201d You have to use the specific words: \u201cCan you waive my late fee?\u201d There\u2019s some some wibbly law about that where a customer service representative is not allowed to take that fee away unless you specifically ask for it.\u201d\n\nOn automating your credit card payments:\n\nPlease automate your monthly payments. It is the best thing you can do for yourself. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s the first credit card you have ever gotten right out of college or if you\u2019re nearing retirement \u2014 it just benefits you so much to automate your payments. Because, like we said earlier the biggest part of your credit score is the fact that you were able to pay your bill on time.\n\nThe interview with Farnoosh Torabi\n\nOn the first thing you should do when you want to get out of debt:\n\nThe first thing is actually to not obsess over the numbers and really take a step back and think about what is the whole purpose of this? Because certainly of course it feels great to not have that financial burden, that bill coming every month. But what will this afford you? ... Put this in context of how this is going to ultimately help you achieve your own personal endeavours.\n\nOn finding a side hustle if you don\u2019t think you have anything to offer:", "description": "On this episode of The Upgrade, we\u2019re tackling debt.
