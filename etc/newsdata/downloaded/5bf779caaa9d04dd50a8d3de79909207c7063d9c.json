We're improving and we're learning,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee that will hear from Muilenburg on Wednesday, said in a written statement for the hearing that the panel was aware of \"at least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-Vice President and General Manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns, several months before the Lion Air crash in October 2018.\"\n\nBoeing did not immediately comment.\n\n\"Something went drastically wrong, a total of 346 people died, and we have a duty to fix it,\" DeFazio added.\n\nSenator Jon Tester noted Boeing had won approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to avoid having to add new crew alerts because it would have been expensive. \"It wouldn't have happened if FAA would have been doing their job and it also wouldn't have happened if you had known what the hell was going on,\" he said.\n\nTester, a Montana senator, said widescale changes were needed. \"I would walk before I would get on a 737 MAX. I would walk. There is no way ... You shouldn't be cutting corners and I see corners being cut.\"\n\nTaking turns to grill Muilenburg during his first appearance at a hearing on Capitol Hill in the year since the first crash in Indonesia, senators suggested Boeing had not been completely honest and expressed dismay that the 2016 instant messages did not prompt an immediate reaction from the company.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz said he could not understand why the messages did not prompt an immediate response from Boeing senior management, saying the exchange about the problems \"describes what happened in Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines.\"\n\nHe questioned why Muilenburg did not read the messages earlier.\n\n\"How did your team not put in front of you, run in with their hair on fire saying 'we have a real problem here'?\" Cruz said, asking why the messages did not prompt a \"nine-alarm fire.\"\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \"safe plane safer.\" Tuesday's hearing represents Boeing's broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and family members had sought.\n\nDespite the tough questions, Boeing shares ended 2.4% higher at $348.93 on Tuesday.\n\nU.S. Senator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, questioned Muilenburg over the company's delay in releasing the IMs in which a former test pilot described erratic behavior of a simulator version of the MCAS software and also mentioned \"Jedi-mind tricking\" regulators over training requirements.\n\nWicker said those messages revealed a \"disturbing level of casualness and flippancy.\"\n\nThe FAA is demanding significant new safeguards to MCAS before the plane can fly again.", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg faced intense grilling by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Tuesday over what the company knew about its MCAS stall-prevention system linked to two deadly crashes, and about delays in turning over internal 2016 messages that described erratic behavior of the software", "authors": ["David Shepardson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_U2jqS.0hH23rQi_c0LRbw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/6e84d460-fa74-11e9-89bf-6db2d3976e57", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
