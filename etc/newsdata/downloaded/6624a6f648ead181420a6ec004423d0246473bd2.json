But now there's dissent in its ranks.", "language": "en", "text": "Columnist\n\nThe battle to control the Federal Reserve is being waged on many fronts. There\u2019s President Trump\u2019s relentless tirades against Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell \u2014 and Powell\u2019s low-key rejoinders. There\u2019s the clamor from investors (a.k.a.Wall Street) for easy credit to prop up stock prices. Some economists favor cheap credit to sustain low unemployment (3.7 percent). What\u2019s been missing is a cogent challenge to the reigning consensus, which is this: Unless the Fed acts forcefully, the economy could fall into a recession.\n\nThat\u2019s now changed.\n\nIn a recent speech at New York University, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, gave a detailed criticism of Fed policy. At its past two meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 the Fed\u2019s main decision-making body \u2014 has cut interest rates a quarter point. Rosengren, along with Esther George of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank , dissented in both cases. (Dissenting in the other direction \u2014 favoring easier credit \u2014 was James B. Bullard, president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank .)\n\nThis is significant. The political culture of the Fed emphasizes deference to the chair and unanimity in most of its decisions. When dissents do occur, they usually reflect a fundamental disagreement. That is surely the case now.\n\nTo understand why, it helps to know a little \u201cFed-speak,\u201d the technical jargon that economists and others use to discuss the economy. \u201cMonetary policy\u201d refers to the actions the Fed can take to ease or tighten credit. When policy is \u201caccommodative,\u201d it means that borrowers can find loans easily and that interest rates are, relatively speaking, low. When policy is not accommodative, it\u2019s harder to borrow, and rates are higher or rising.\n\nThe interest rate that most concerns the Fed is the so-called fed funds rate \u2014 the rate on overnight loans among banks. When the Fed raises or lowers this rate, long-term rates on bonds and mortgages are assumed to move in sympathy. Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don\u2019t.\n\nThe crux of Rosengren\u2019s complaint is that the Fed is running a highly loose policy when the economy has reached or exceeded \u201cfull employment.\u201d The fed funds rate is now pegged between 1.75 percent and 2 percent, with another cut widely expected by year\u2019s end. This upends traditional policy, which calls for lower rates when the economy is faltering and higher rates when markets are tight.\n\nHere\u2019s how Rosengren describes his objection:\n\n\u201cHaving such an accommodative stance of monetary policy is unusual in what appears to be a fairly robust economy. Typically, the federal funds rate . . . [falls] during economic downturns. During a downturn, the costs of lowering rates are relatively modest, as fears of rising inflation are low and the concern is usually that too little credit being extended.\u201d\n\nPowell and others seem to fear that Trump\u2019s trade wars, weak corporate investment and ongoing geopolitical turmoil (Brexit, Iran) will slow the economy and, perhaps, trigger a recession. This is where Rosengren departs from Powell and his Fed colleagues. In his NYU lecture, he noted that the U.S. economy is still growing at a 2 percent annual rate, roughly in line with its potential, despite all the problems.\n\n\u201cSo the risks, while of concern, have not slowed the economy below its sustainable rate of growth,\u201d he said. It doesn\u2019t need more juice in the form of lower interest rates, which could raise inflation or fuel financial speculation. Note also that Rosengren rejects Trump\u2019s policy, which is clearly aimed at winning reelection. It\u2019s Powell on steroids \u2014 cut the Fed funds rate to zero and do it immediately.\n\nThe history here is relevant. In the past, the Fed has repeatedly waited too long before tightening its policies, and the consequences have been calamitous. In the 1960s and 1970s, the result was much higher inflation, peaking at about 13 percent in 1979 and 1980. In the early 2000s, the Fed\u2019s easy-credit policies contributed to the devastating financial crisis.\n\nRosengren usefully reminds us of these failures. The main lesson: The pursuit of perpetual prosperity backfires. This happened before and could happen again. Take inflation. Over the past year, the \u201ccore\u201d consumer price index has risen 2.4 percent, slightly higher than recent reports (the core CPI removes food and energy prices, which are exceptionally volatile).\n\nSimilarly, Rosengren thinks that some commercial real estate properties are overvalued, especially projects that embrace the \u201cco-working\u201d model of renting space to very small businesses. \u201cThis segment of the economy is likely to be particularly susceptible to an economic downturn,\u201d Rosengren writes. There could be a chain reaction. Tenants default on their leases, leading to landlords defaulting on bank loans, leading to losses to banks, which hold mortgages on the buildings.\n\nRosengren may (or may not) be proved right. But he has raised the quality of debate and analysis to a new and better level.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "description": "Belief in the risk of recession is no longer unanimous.", "authors": ["Robert J.
