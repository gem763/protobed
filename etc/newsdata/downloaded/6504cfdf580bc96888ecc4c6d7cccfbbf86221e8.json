Pharmaceutical companies would also have to retroactively rebate to the federal government the money it made from price increases on drugs purchased by Medicare that have exceeded inflation since 2016.\n\nPrevious iterations of Pelosi\u2019s plan, of which her top health policy adviser Wendell Primus has been the architect, covered as few as 25 drugs and relied on an arbitration process between the federal government and drug makers to serve as a backstop in the event of an impasse in negotiation. The prospect of relying on arbitration was a particular sore point with progressives, who noted that it is a process that favors corporations with expensive legal teams.\n\nThe most ambitious drug price bill in Congress, introduced by Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, goes significantly further than Pelosi\u2019s legislation, threatening to impose generic drug competition on pharmaceutical companies if prices of any drugs \u2015 not just a select group \u2015 exceed the average rates in five developed nations.\n\nKhanna, a vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, lauded the plan in a statement for taking on \u201coutrageously high drug prices through direct negotiation as opposed to private arbitration,\u201d as well as the provision tying costs to prices in other countries as his bill does.\n\nBut he expressed hope that Pelosi would consider expanding the universe of prescription drugs over which the federal government would negotiate. \u201cWe should not bind our hands when it comes to lowering health care costs,\u201d he said.\n\nAlex Lawson, the executive director of Social Security Works, a nonprofit pushing a tougher approach with drugmakers, echoed Khanna\u2019s call for the bill to include all prescription drugs. He also called for the rebates on price hikes that exceeded inflation to apply to all drugs, not just those purchased by Medicare.\n\nFor his part, Maybarduk of Public Citizen took issue with tying U.S. drug prices to rates abroad, arguing instead for \u201ca fresh opportunity to establish fair prices\u201d based on \u201creal research opportunities and investments.\u201d\n\nBut overall, the activist response was an about-face from months of griping about a process that they complained they had been shut out of.\n\n\u201cThis draft is a good starting point to stop pharma\u2019s outrageous rip-offs,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nPrescription drugs are like gun violence laws: 90% of the country wants strong legislation. The only people who don\u2019t are the interest groups. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.)\n\nThe speaker\u2019s office argued that limiting the number of drugs subject to negotiation is essential to making sure the Department of Health and Human Services has the time and resources needed to negotiate sufficiently low prices on the drugs it bargains over. Given the difficulty of going up against the pharmaceutical companies, it is better to make sure that the drug prices it does address actually go down significantly, according to Pelosi\u2019s office.\n\nAt the same time, Pelosi\u2019s staff and several House Democrats with close ties to congressional leadership insisted that the summary of the bill obtained by Bloomberg Government is out of date, though they would not discuss the ways in which it was likely to change.\n\n\u201cWe continue to engage Members across the caucus as the committees of jurisdiction work to develop the boldest, toughest possible bill to lower prescription drug prices for all Americans,\u201d Pelosi spokesman Henry Connelly said in a statement.\n\nIf the speaker plans to introduce a bill that is more accommodating to pharmaceutical companies, though, Khanna argued that it would be a tough sell in the House Democratic Caucus.\n\n\u201cWe need to make the bill stronger, not weaker, to get support from the House Democratic Caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cPrescription drugs are like gun violence laws: 90% of the country wants strong legislation. The only people who don\u2019t are the interest groups. We need to be for the boldest possible legislation we can.\u201d\n\nRep. Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized her deep disagreement with any bill that uses arbitration as a backstop in negotiations. \u201cThat\u2019s been a major issue for me,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a CPC member who chairs the House Rules Committee, was less specific about his red lines, saying he wants a prescription drug bill that\u2019s \u201creal, not Memorex.\u201d\n\nWhen an earlier draft of prescription drug legislation that Pelosi aide Primus had been negotiating came out in May, it elicited outrage among progressive activists not just because it covered so few drugs and relied on arbitration as a backstop for an impasse in negotiations, but because it reflected too much of a conciliatory posture toward President Donald Trump. Primus was reportedly trying to craft the bill with an eye toward what could get Trump\u2019s signature, rather than writing legislation providing the maximum possible relief for patients and then forcing Trump to take it or negotiate it down from there. It felt to activists like another case of Democrats negotiating with themselves before they even got to the bargaining table.\n\nBut slowly, as more liberal House Democrats \u2015 including Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a co-chair of the CPC \u2015 protested, behind closed doors and in the press, Pelosi and her team moved in their direction. Pocan reported in June that Pelosi had assured him and his fellow CPC co-chair, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, that the bill would cover 250 drugs, rather than 25.\n\nThe collaboration of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, and the committee\u2019s ranking Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, on a bill with key concessions to Democrats also improved House progressives\u2019 bargaining power, according to an advocate involved in lobbying congressional leadership on the matter. The legislation, which Grassley and Wyden introduced in late July, included a form of the inflation-based rebates for Medicare drugs that ended up in Pelosi\u2019s House bill.\n\nThe CPC kept the heat on with a letter to Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland in late August articulating their priorities for any prescription drug bill. They had four main demands: direct negotiation; no arbitration; \u201crobust safeguards,\u201d such as the threat of generic competition, aimed at locking in lower prices; and no limits on the number of drugs covered by the plan.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement about the leaked bill summary, Pocan, Jayapal and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s panel on health care, expressed optimism that Pelosi would address their outstanding concerns about the bill.\n\nThe trio said they are seeking answers about the way the 75% tax would be implemented; why there is a cap on the number of drugs negotiated; why cost of drugs is the sole criterion for assessing which drugs get negotiated; and why the bill does not include the threat of generic competition as leverage for negotiations.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s deliver on our pledge last year with meaningful legislation that actually lowers medicine costs for consumers,\u201d they said in the statement.\n\nPelosi\u2019s office maintains that the speaker was planning to steadily improve on the bill all along and that various leaked drafts of the legislation had not reflected what the end product would look like.\n\nBut in their statement, the CPC\u2019s leaders suggested that their pressure on leadership has already had an impact.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the leaked draft plan from Speaker Pelosi contains several important CPC priorities, including a direct negotiation proposal instead of arbitration and action to lower prices for all payers,\u201d Reps. Pocan, Jayapal and Doggett said.", "description": "Earlier drafts of legislation aiming to lower drug prices had elicited stinging criticism.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d77e7a62300001005512b3a.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
