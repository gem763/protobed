We cannot compare,\" said Danese, who oversaw the construction of an arena that boasts dazzling views of One World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty. \"For the horses it was perfect.\"\n\nDanese brought in a separate ferry service to ensure access for riders, grooms and staff starting at five a.m. and arranged for barges to bring in supply trucks.\n\nThe three-day competition is the largest sports event ever orchestrated on the island, a seasonal refuge for urban-weary New Yorkers and tourists, according to Sarah Krautheim, a spokeswoman for the Trust for Governors Island.\n\n\"They were looking for an iconic New York City venue,\" Krautheim told Reuters, adding that the Trust expected approximately 2,000 visitors per day at the event, which is free for those attending.\n\nThe island, which had 8,000 visitors per year when it opened to the public in 2005 and had close to one million visitors this year, regularly hosts concerts and other cultural events.\n\n\"The idea is to promote a little bit our sport in different areas and to attract also people who are not familiar,\" said Danese.\n\n(Reporting By Amy Tennery; editing by Clare Fallon)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - You can lead a horse to water but can you make 95 of them board a ferry from Lower Manhattan to an island in the middle of the New York Harbor?", "authors": ["Amy Tennery"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
