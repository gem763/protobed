As I made clear in that note, sports touches on nearly every aspect of life\u2014from politics to business to pop culture and more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that Deadspin reporters and editors should go after every conceivable story as long as it has something to do with sports.\u201d\n\nHowever, Maidment added, alluding to the recent firing, \u201cWe are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction, and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d\n\nThe stick-to-sports rule came several months after Deadspin\u2019s former parent company, Gizmodo Media Group, was bought by private equity firm Great Hill Partners and renamed G/O Media.\n\nIn the months since, G/O higher-ups have clashed with top Deadspin staff over the site\u2019s longtime commitment to covering topics beyond sports. Though the site primarily focuses on sports and sports media, the site\u2019s writers have also blogged about politics, media, and pop culture.\n\nIn August, editor-in-chief Megan Greenwell left the site after G/O management allegedly asked her to limit the site to sports. And on Tuesday, one day after G/O execs put that mandate in writing, Petchesky announced that he\u2019d been fired for refusing to hew to the edict.\n\nG/O\u2019s mandate and its firing of Petchesky was met with widespread condemnation from readers, journalists, and the site\u2019s own reporters, who publicly criticized the decision and shared many popular non-sports posts from the site.\n\n\u201cEarlier today, @JimSpanfeller, CEO of G/O Media, fired our colleague and longtime Deadspin Deputy Editor Barry Petchesky. This will not stand. We will have updates soon,\u201d G/O\u2019s editorial union posted on Tuesday.", "description": "\u201cWe are sorry that some on the Deadspin staff don\u2019t agree with that editorial direction, and refuse to work within that incredibly broad mandate.\u201d", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Media Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572373568/191029-tani-deadspin-tease_cerexl", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
