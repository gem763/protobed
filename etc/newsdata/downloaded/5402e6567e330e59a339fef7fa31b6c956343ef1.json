With no back-up any malfunction could trigger the plane into a dive \u2013 as investigators believe happened with both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airline crashes, killing 346.\n\nThe release of the document, in addition to warnings from Boeing\u2019s chief test pilot that the MCAS system could engage without warning, adds to belief that Boeing overlooked safety in a rush to put the Max 737, its most profitable model, into production.\n\nThe new email is among others unearthed during withering transportation committee hearings during which lawmakers have repeatedly assailed Boeing\u2019s CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, over a failure to prioritize safety.\n\n\u201cYou have a systemic problem in your company. You\u2019re driving profit. You\u2019re not driving quality, and you\u2019re sure as heck not driving safety,\u201d the California Democrat John Garamendi told the chief executive.\n\nIn another memo, a veteran Boeing production manager warned the company was placing the workforce under too much strain in its rush to speed up production of the jet.\n\n\u201cFrankly right now, my internal warning bells are going off,\u201d the manager wrote in the email, which was sent four months before the Indonesia crash. \u201cAnd for the first time in my life, I\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane.\u201d\n\nThe email, which was sent to the general manager of the Max program, warned that workers on the Max assembly line were exhausted by the schedule and there should be a temporary halt.\n\n\u201cI know this would take a lot of planning, but the alternative of rushing the build is far riskier,\u201d the manager wrote.\n\nAt the hearing, Muilenburg confirmed the note\u2019s author had copied the warning to him, and he had answered them. However, Boeing did not slow its rate of production.\n\nPeter DeFazio, the Democratic chairman of the committee, told the hearing the manager had resigned his job at Boeing \u201cbecause his concerns weren\u2019t being addressed\u201d.\n\nHe accused Boeing of a \u201clack of candor\u201d over the crashes, after John Hamilton, Boeing\u2019s chief engineer, testified that the company had identified MCAS as the probable cause within days of the first crash and begun to work on a fix.", "description": "Lawmakers have assailed CEO Dennis Muilenburg over failure to prioritize safety, in second day of congressional hearings", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6668e626cbad44d983b22e25bdb0d119510d3fd/0_135_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0b376959eaa3b8e963257d254d70f441", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
