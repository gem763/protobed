REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo\n\nMilitary buildups on both sides of the heavily fortified border between the two nations have come to the forefront with recent short-range missile launches by North Korea, perfecting an arsenal it says is necessary to defend against new South Korean weapons.\n\nOn Wednesday North Korean state media reported that leader Kim Jong Un had personally supervised on Tuesday the test firing of a large multiple-rocket launch system, a type of weapon analysts say threatens forces in South Korea.\n\nPyongyang has sharply criticized U.S.-South Korean military drills and South Korea\u2019s defense procurements - including an aircraft carrier, stealth fighters and spy satellites - as undisguised preparations for a preemptive strike.\n\nIn a commentary on Friday, North Korean state news agency KCNA said South Korea\u2019s pursuit of new weapons systems is an \u201cunpardonable act of perfidy\u201d that threatens to undermine peace on the peninsula.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Ministry of National Defence (MND) did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in\u2019s administration has committed billions of additional dollars to the country\u2019s defense budget, which is already among the largest in the world.\n\nIn 2018 South Korea\u2019s military expenditures reached $43.1 billion, an increase of 7 percent compared with 2017, according to the MND. It was the biggest single-year jump since a 8.7 percent increase in 2009.\n\nIn July the MND announced South Korea would build a light aircraft carrier, the country\u2019s first. And in August it unveiled a plan to spend about $239 billion more between 2020 and 2024.\n\nAbout $85 billion of the future budget is earmarked for arms improvements, representing an average 10.3 percent year-on-year increase.\n\n\u201cGiven the recent uncertain security environment, the government is investing heavily in strengthening its defense capabilities,\u201d the MND said when the plan was announced.\n\nBy 2023, the \u201cforce enhancement\u201d budget will account for more than 36% of total defense spending, up from about 31% this year, according to South Korea\u2019s 2018 Defense White Paper.\n\nThe planned aircraft carrier is expected to accommodate vertical-landing F-35B stealth fighter jets.\n\nAmong the other weapons on Seoul\u2019s shopping list are new missile defense systems; three more destroyers equipped with the cutting-edge Aegis radar system; spy satellites and high-altitude reconnaissance drones; anti-submarine helicopters; maritime patrol aircraft; submarines capable of firing cruise and ballistic missiles; and a warship armed with guided missiles.\n\n\u201cNeither Korea wants to a full-blown confrontation, but both want to make sure they have the weapons platforms and defense resources available in the event a flare-up happens,\u201d said Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nGRAPHIC - South Korean Military Spending: here\n\nEXPENSIVE ARMS RACE\n\nOf most immediate concern to North Korea, this year South Korea took delivery of the first of 40 land-based F-35A stealth aircraft from the United States.\n\nNorth Korea criticized that as well as other weapons announcements as a reckless arms build-up that was forcing it to develop new short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs) to \u201ccompletely destroy\u201d the new threats.\n\nThe F-35 \u201cputs North Korea\u2019s anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense systems in an extremely vulnerable position, which is likely why the North is responding by accelerating its own SRBM development,\u201d DePetris said.\n\nNorth Korea also views the F-35s as violations of a military de-escalation agreement the two countries signed in September 2018. The Koreas agreed to cease \u201call hostile acts,\u201d but the deal did not mention new weapons.\n\nWith North Korea under tight international sanctions, the North cannot afford an arms race, analysts said.\n\nIn 2016, the last year for which estimates were available, North Korea spent an estimated $4 billion, or 23 percent of its GDP, on defense. Almost 5% of the population serves on active duty in the military, according to the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2018 World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers report.\n\nAlthough Kim has signaled interest in using more of the country\u2019s vast defense industry to work on civilian projects, there is little sign of progress, and international aid organizations say tens of thousands of North Koreans face food shortages.\n\nCHANGING MILITARY SITUATION\n\nWhile the surge in military spending may seem to contradict Moon\u2019s push to engage North Korea, analysts say it is largely driven by other issues, including South Korea\u2019s changing demographics and the country\u2019s relationship with longtime ally the United States.\n\nSince the 1950-1953 Korean War, the American military has retained the authority to control hundreds of thousands of South Korean forces alongside the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea if another war breaks out.\n\nMoon has made obtaining \u201coperational control,\u201d or OPCON, of those joint forces a major goal of his administration, and building up the military is an important part of gaining U.S. approval for that, said Kathryn Botto, an analyst at the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nAdditionally, South Korea\u2019s population is aging, reducing the number of young people available to serve in South Korea\u2019s military.\n\nBy 2025, South Korea plans to reduce its standing military from 599,000 troops to 500,000, according to the Defense White Paper, with the aim of \u201ca military that is smaller in size but stronger in combat.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has pushed South Korea to buy more American weapons and pay more for U.S. troops stationed there, Botto said.\n\n\u201cInvesting more in capabilities that it can acquire from the U.S. both helps keep Trump on Moon\u2019s side and augments his OPCON transfer and defense reform goals,\u201d she said.\n\nBut analysts also say that South Korea wants reduce its dependence on American gear, partly because it is frustrated by Washington\u2019s occasional unwillingness to share the best technology.\n\nFILE PHOTO: North Korea test fires a new weapon, in this undated photo released on August 11, 2019 by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). KCNA via REUTERS/File Photo\n\n\u201cIn order to secure self-defense capabilities and lead the development of national science and technology, the acquisition policy will change to center around domestic R&D rather than overseas purchases,\u201d the MND said in its August budget announcement.\n\nMoon wants to build up the military\u2019s ability to operate as independently as possible before the stagnating economy makes such spending harder, said one Western military official in Seoul, who was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\n\u201cSouth Korea is on course to be the largest military R&D spender in the world, as a proportion of its budget. They are angling to be a bigger player than ever on the world stage.\u201d", "description": "South Korea and North Korea have continued to pour resources into modernizing their militaries despite a frenzy of diplomacy since 2018, data shows, creating a point of tension that has sharpened as talks have stalled.", "authors": ["Josh Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428514911&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A01U", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
