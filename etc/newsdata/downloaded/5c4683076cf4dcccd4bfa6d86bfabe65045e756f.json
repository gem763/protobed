REUTERS/Dave Paresh\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - London\u2019s Court of Appeal gave the go-ahead for action against Google over claims it collected data from more than 4 million iPhone users, overturning a ruling in 2018 that in effect blocked any route to legal redress.\n\nThe claimants said Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., had illegally accessed details of Apple iPhone users\u2019 internet browsing data by bypassing privacy settings on the Safari browser between June 2011 and February 2012.\n\nLondon\u2019s High Court ruled in October 2018 that Google\u2019s alleged role in the collection, collation and use of data from the browser was wrongful and a breach of duty, but claimants had not suffered \u201cdamage\u201d as specified by Britain\u2019s Data Protection Act.\n\nJames Oldnall, lead lawyer on the case, said the Court of Appeal decision had \u201cconfirmed our view that representative actions are essential for holding corporate giants to account\u201d.\n\nRichard Lloyd, the representative claimant in the mass action, said Wednesday\u2019s judgment \u201csends a very clear message to Google and other large tech companies: you are not above the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle can be held to account in this country for misusing people\u2019s personal data, and groups of consumers can together ask the courts for redress when firms profit unlawfully from \u2018repeated and widespread\u2019 violations of our data protection rights,\u201d he added.\n\nLloyd also said he expected a lengthy legal process.\n\nGoogle said protecting the privacy and security of its users had always been its number one priority.\n\n\u201cThis case relates to events that took place nearly a decade ago and that we addressed at the time,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe believe it has no merit and should be dismissed.\u201d", "description": "London's Court of Appeal gave the go-ahead for action against Google over claims it collected data from more than 4 million iPhone users, overturning a ruling in 2018 that in effect blocked any route to legal redress.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436248194&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9110D"}
