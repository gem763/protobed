The officer also told Ames, \"I'm going to put a cap in your ass.\"\n\nA second officer, who police did not identify, received a written reprimand. Williams described the officer's actions as trying to de-escalate the situation.\n\nThe announcement of Meyer's firing during a Tuesday news conference came at the same time Phoenix police announced the firing of Clinton David Swick following an unrelated investigation into his Facebook posts.\n\nThe Plain View Project, launched by Philadelphia lawyer Emily Baker-White, created a database of public Facebook posts and comments made by current and former police officers from several jurisdictions across the United States, including Phoenix. The posts endorsed violence in some cases against Mexicans, Muslims, women and criminal defendants.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Phoenix police also announced it had fired Sgt. Daniel B. Jones in a separate unrelated internal affairs investigation.\n\n\"No chief ever wants to discuss discipline, like this in a public format,\" Williams said. \"I expect my officers to be respectful, to be professional, to be courteous, and that is not what happened in (these) cases.\"\n\nThe officers have the right to appeal the decision.\n\n'Suspension is just not sufficient'\n\nWilliams said the Police Department's Disciplinary Review Board recommended Meyers receive a 240-hour unpaid suspension for his actions in the police stop.\n\nBut, she said, this wasn't enough.\n\nUltimately, the police chief decides what kind of punishment an officer receives if investigators find wrongdoing.\n\n\"I have notified him of my intention to terminate his employment,\" Williams said. \"A 240-hour suspension is just not sufficient to reverse the adverse effects of his actions on our department, and our community.\"\n\nWilliams said she didn't come to the decision lightly. Meyer has been with the department since 1995.\n\n\"I will say this, it was difficult for both of us. For me to make the decision, and for him to take the call,\" she said.\n\nFor the the second officer involved in the stop, Williams said the disciplinary board recommended he receive a written reprimand. Williams agreed.\n\n'This is partial justice for my clients'\n\nTom Horne, who is representing Ames and Harper, had filed a $10 million claim against Phoenix.\n\n\u201cThis is partial justice for my clients. To get full justice, the job is now mine to get it for them with compensation in the lawsuit,\" Horne said during a news conference.\n\nHorne, a former Arizona attorney general, said he has always been a supporter of police. But, he said, it's important that those who are tarnishing the profession be held accountable.\n\n\u201cI think the vast majority of police are fine public servants. In any group, whether it\u2019s lawyers, journalists or anybody else, you get some bad apples,\" Horne said. \"And it\u2019s my job to be sure that justice is done when we do get these bad apples.\u201d\n\nAmes said he also welcomed the decision, saying he hopes this sends a message to officers not to treat others the way Meyer treated him and his family. He said the incident has left his family traumatized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been real bad. It\u2019s hard to get over that type of stuff,\" he said. \"It was a very tragic and traumatizing moment. So to know that he\u2019s been fired is some type of little relief, but there\u2019s still a lot to work on.\u201d\n\nUnion denounced Williams' decision while advocacy group applauds it\n\nThe Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, the Phoenix police union that represents the department's rank and file, posted on Facebook that it doesn't agree with Williams' decisions to fire Meyer and Swick.\n\n\"PLEA has a complete understanding of the position Chief Jeri Williams is in as the leader of the Phoenix Police Department and as an appointed employee of the City of Phoenix,\" the statement said. \"PLEA is dedicated to its members, and we ensure that we carry our members\u2019 interests through until the end of all the processes that encompass employment with the City of Phoenix.\"\n\nPoder in Action, a Maryvale-based advocacy group that has been critical of Phoenix police's use of force, applauded Williams' decision to fire Meyer.\n\n\"Community made this happen! Without the pressure and bystander video, Christopher Meyer would still be on our streets,\" the group stated on Facebook. \"If he has (the) audacity to appeal to the civil service board for his job, we gotta make sure he doesn\u2019t get rehired.\"\n\nThe internal affairs process\n\nEvery officer who has been terminated has the right to appeal. Phoenix police have explained the process:\n\nWhen claims of wrongdoing are made, the department's Professional Standards Bureau investigates. If the bureau finds there was employee misconduct, investigators can refer the case to the Disciplinary Review Board, which is chaired by one of the department's assistant police chiefs and has six additional members, including two peer officers, two civilians and two police commanders.\n\nAfter reviewing the case, the board will make a disciplinary recommendation to the police chief, who also reviews the case and ultimately decides what type of punishment the employee will receive.\n\nThe employee has the right to appeal to the city's five-member Civil Service Board, which will sustain the punishment or reduce the punishment. In the case of the employee being fired, this board can give him or her their job back.\n\nThe viral stop\n\nThe couple said it all stemmed from an anonymous call to police that their daughter stole a doll from a Family Dollar store \u2014 something the family says was an accident.\n\nAmes said they were dropping off their daughter at the babysitter's apartment when an officer stopped them. He alleged the officers didn't use lights or sirens before they walked over to the parked car carrying Ames, Harper and their two daughters, ages 4 and 1.\n\n\"Next thing you know, a police officer ... comes up, open the door, banging on the window with a gun, saying he's gonna shoot us in the face, telling us to get out of the car,\" Ames said during a news conference.\n\nIn one of the videos, which was recorded by a resident of the apartment complex, officers can be heard yelling and cursing at the couple. Meyer can be seen pointing a gun at the car, and then is heard saying, \"You're going to get f--king shot!\" He also tells Ames, \"I'm going to put a cap in your ass.\"\n\nMeyer then goes to the back driver's side door, but could not open it because it was malfunctioning, the notice of claim detailed. He bangs on the window and tells Harper, who was pregnant and holding her 1-year-old, to open the door and to put her hands up. She tells him it wouldn't open and that her hands were up.\n\nOFFICER FIRINGS:Phoenix officer in Facebook post scandal fired\n\nA second officer then comes up to the front seat of the car with his gun drawn and points his weapon at Ames, according to the notice of claim. The officer pulls Ames out of the car.\n\nAnother video starts with Ames lying flat on the pavement as a Phoenix police officer handcuffs him. Ames is then pulled off the ground and pressed up against a police car before the officer kicks out one of his legs. Ames is handcuffed at this time.\n\n\"He told the father to spread his legs, which the father did,\" the notice of claim the family filed with the city detailed. \"The officer kicked him in the right leg so hard that the father collapsed, and then the officer yanked him back up. He kept his knee between the father\u2019s legs. He punched the father very hard in the back for no reason.\"\n\nHarper and her two daughters then step out of the car. One of the officers attempts to grab one of the daughters from Harper while he's trying to take the mother into custody. She refuses to follow the officer's orders to place the baby on the hot pavement.\n\nThe family said the baby was injured when the officer pulled her by the arm. Harper ultimately handed the baby off to a resident of the apartment complex.\n\nAmes was kept in the back of a police car for 30 minutes and Harper for 15. Ames told the officers he owned the car when questioned if he stole it. They were released after another lieutenant came and defused the situation, according to the claim. Neither Ames nor Harper was charged in connection with the incident.\n\nThe officers were not wearing body cameras.\n\n\"Our officers are dispatched 1,800 times each day when our community needs us and 99% of the time we get it right,\" Williams said at the news conference. \"But when we don't, it does come at a cost. Nearly 4,000 other members of the Phoenix Police Department must bear the burden of that failed contact with our community members.\"\n\nUriel Garcia covers public-safety issues in Arizona.
