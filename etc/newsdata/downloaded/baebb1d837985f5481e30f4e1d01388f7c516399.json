It fell after the New York Federal Reserve said it would conduct a repurchase operation to lower the funding costs.\n\n\"Everyone knows a rate cut is expected, but we'll be looking at the statement and the dot plot,\" said Pooja Kumra, European rates strategist at TD Securities in London, referring to where policymakers expect rates to be in the future.\n\n\"There will also be a lot of focus on what the Fed says about the short-term funding squeeze.\"\n\nGermany's benchmark 10-year bond yield was little changed at -0.48%, below last week's six-week high of -0.43%.\n\nSpain's 10-year bond yield was also steady, trading at 0.29% , after news that new elections will be held. The country has been in political limbo since Socialists emerged as the biggest party in April's parliamentary elections but without enough seats to govern on their own.\n\nAnalysts said the prospect of a new round of ECB asset purchases offset the political uncertainty. The ECB announced open-ended asset purchases last week to boost growth and inflation.\n\nThere was some focus on Germany, which sells 30-year bonds later this session after a weak sale of longer-dated bonds last month.\n\n\"The recent rise in long-term yields might make the Bund more attractive to investors, also in light of the new round of QE (quantitative easing),\" UniCredit analysts said in a note.
