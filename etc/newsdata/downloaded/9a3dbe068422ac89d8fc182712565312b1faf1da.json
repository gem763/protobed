Its results also didn't show any signs of growth slowdown in China, which is good news since this is a problem for several of its competitors, RBC analysts said.\n\nAt 1124 GMT, shares in L'Oreal traded 7% higher at EUR261.70.\n\nOn a reported basis, sales were up 11% from the same period the previous year, L'Oreal said.\n\nGrowth was once again spurred by the luxe and active cosmetic divisions, both of which posted like-for-like sales growth of 14%. The Asia-Pacific region, travel retail, skincare and e-commerce continued to drive growth, too, L'Oreal said.\n\nCiti analysts liked the jump recorded in e-commerce sales, which grew 48% like-for-like, accounting for more than 80% of L'Oreal's total growth for the quarter by the bank's estimates. \"With growth now entirely driven by new channels, portfolio breadth becomes a sustainable driver to outperform a market where shelf space is now a less relevant concept,\" Citi analysts said.\n\nAccording to L'Oreal management's estimates, the broader beauty market grew by about 5.5% in the quarter, which means the company outpaced the market and continued to gain share, Berenberg analysts said.\n\nOn the negative side, sales in North America declined on a like-for-like basis. This was due in part to weakness in the U.S. makeup market, especially as some of L'Oreal's brands struggle to adapt to a shift toward more natural makeup trends, Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFor 2019, the company reiterated its confidence that it can outperform the market and grow its sales and profit.", "description": "Shares in L'Oreal SA (OR.FR) jumped higher Wednesday after the company reported strong third-quarter sales growth on Tuesday evening, beating analysts'...", "authors": ["Cristina Roca"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
