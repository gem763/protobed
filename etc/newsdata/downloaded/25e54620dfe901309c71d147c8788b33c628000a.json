When she pops into DRUM\u2019s offices for a catch-up, the pint-sized radio host is a bundle of energy, despite her long day.\n\nTwasa rises long before the crack of dawn so listeners can tune into her Monate Breakfast Show from 6am-9am, but she wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n\u201cRadio is home for me, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m tired or I\u2019m at a job,\u201d she tells us. \u201cI can count the days I\u2019ve been off-air or off sick. My listeners go crazy when they don\u2019t hear me, they ask where I am.\u201d\n\nTwasa started her radio career in 1999 but became a household name when she replaced Vinolia \u201cV-Mash\u201d Mashego on SABC1\u2019s hit music show Jam Alley back in 2002. She found fame on TV, but radio has always been her first love. \u201cI\u2019ve built credibility with the listeners. They trust me and come to me for advice.\u201d\n\nThe broadcaster has barely aged from her days as a TV presenter. \u201cI haven\u2019t aged because fitness is my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI go to gym every day, not to lose or gain weight. I go because that\u2019s what I do every day without fail. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThis year Twasa celebrates turning 40 and her 20-year radio career, but she doesn\u2019t look a day over 30 thanks to her healthy lifestyle. It\u2019s all because of a childhood pact she and her brother made while flipping through old pictures of their parents.\n\n\u201cWe saw how they gained weight through the years, and decided how we wanted to look at 40. We started going to gym and eating well.\u201d\n\nHer hard work has paid off. It\u2019s hard to imagine the sexy, successful radio personality has been single for two decades. She\u2019s had one relationship in the past 20 years, but things didn\u2019t work out. Twasa would love nothing more than to have a family \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to have a child because my biological clock is ticking. A child deserves both parents and I will wait for as long as I can.\n\n\u201cI get asked a lot when I am getting married. I don\u2019t know, but I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s been single for half her life \u201cbut just because I\u2019m single doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a virgin\u201d, she blushes. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a born-again Christian I\u2019m only allowed to have sex after marriage, but I do have a crush.\n\n\u201cEish this guy doesn\u2019t see he\u2019s my crush, though. I\u2019ll wait, maybe he\u2019ll get it one day because I\u2019m too old-school to ask a guy out.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s no stranger to the dating scene, but Twasa simply hasn\u2019t found Mr Right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for someone who sees me as an equal,\u201d she says. \u201cA person who wants to see me succeed and doesn\u2019t just see a successful person, someone who wants to build with me and grow old with me.\u201d\n\nShe plans to stay celibate until she meets her dream guy.\n\n\u201cSexual purity is important. I\u2019ve kept my church leaders close to me and they\u2019ve helped to keep me accountable.\u201d\n\nHer faith has always kept her grounded. Eight years ago, Twasa opened up about being raped when she was six years old. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was rape then, but I realised what it was as an adult and I decided to come out with it for my own healing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe experience had long-reaching effects. \u201cIt made me angry. I didn\u2019t hate men but for many years I was very competitive with men.\u201d\n\nShe sought counselling for her anger issues and her faith also helped her find peace. \u201cHad I not been a religious person, I would\u2019ve been very rebellious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t live my life this way because I\u2019m special, but because I\u2019ve always been aware of the power of choice because it comes with consequences,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t given myself the room to misbehave, I don\u2019t find being controversial exciting.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s a stickler for rules but Twasa admits she\u2019s made some bad decisions in the past. \u201cI know when people see me they think boring, goody two-shoes, healthy, perfect, but that\u2019s not always the case. I\u2019ve had some expensive lessons.\n\n\u201cIf I was money-wise growing up, I would\u2019ve been further than I am with my life and career. I would have paid off my bond much quicker. I wouldn\u2019t have taken a balloon payment option on my car. But at least I learnt those lessons and ditched the big Mercedes for a smaller vehicle I could afford.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s been doing a lot of introspection after losing her beloved father, \u201cBra Chips\u201d Seoke, who passed away on 10 April. He was buried on his birthday, 17 April \u2013 a few days before Twasa was honoured by her industry peers at the Liberty Radio Awards.\n\n\u201cI wish he was there to see that moment,\u201d she says.\n\nDays before his passing, Twasa visited her father at his sickbed in QwaQwa. \u201cThose 10 days were the best. I got to say my goodbyes. I told him how proud I was of him and how he has done so well in raising his children.\n\n\u201cHis passing left me with a unique appreciation for time and who I give my time to.\u201d\n\nHer father has always been her rock. When she was eight, Twasa\u2019s mother, Ntaoleng Seoke, died of natural causes, leaving her father to raise her on his own until he remarried.\n\nIt took a village to raise her. \u201cWhen my mom died, the community stepped in,\u201d Twasa says. \u201cMy former teacher taught me how to wear pantyhose and how to choose a bra. Another teacher took over plaiting my hair. My former pastor\u2019s wife taught me how to use sanitary pads, how to stay clean and how to carry myself as a woman. \u201cI was raised by the community.\u201d\n\nWhen Twasa was 16 her father married her stepmother, Agnes-Manoni Seoke, who she loves like a biological mom. \u201cShe\u2019s the only parent I have left, Twasa says. \u201cMy parents have lived a good life. I hope to meet a man like my father one day.\u201d", "description": "Seipati \u201cTwasa\u201d Seoke shares what motivates her, how she\u2019s lasted 20 years in radio and what she\u2019s looking for in Mr Right.", "authors": ["Qhama Dayile"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9421/e53fdce7ba9d4098b2a64434d53dddf2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
