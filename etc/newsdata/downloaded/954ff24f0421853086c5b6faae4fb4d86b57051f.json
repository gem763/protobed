By 2068, the Office for National Statistics predicts this could rise by a further 8.2 million, roughly the population of London.\n\nHousebuilder McCarthy and Stone has called on the Government to consider introducing allocations of age-restricted, bungalow-only sites in local plans. Britain\u2019s ageing population means demand for bungalows is at an all-time high (file image)\n\nTo cope with the demand for more manageable housing, McCarthy and Stone is also calling on ministers to consider making it obligatory to provide age-restricted bungalows as part of the housing mix in larger-scale developments.\n\nIt suggests building more one-storey houses would also give young families the chance to get on the property ladder by freeing up homes that are under-used by the older generation.\n\nJohn Tonkiss, chief executive of McCarthy and Stone, said: \u2018Bungalows are increasingly popular among older generations and should be a consideration for any drive to build more suitable housing. They are easier to maintain, are built with older people in mind and help maintain independence for longer.\n\n\u2018Housing like this not only brings health and other benefits to older people, it also helps free up under-utilised homes for younger generations. This shift can play a major part in helping solve the UK\u2019s housing crisis.\u2019", "description": "There are more than 12 million over-65s in the UK and they are unable to downsize to bungalows due to housing shortages.
