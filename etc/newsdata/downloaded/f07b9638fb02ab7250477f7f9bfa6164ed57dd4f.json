One wit posted a GIF of Homer Simpson pouring bleach in his eyes, and several on Twitter were convinced that a Democrat \u2014 or the Resistance \u2014 dressed Spicer in his flouncy neon-green dancing shirt.\n\nSpicer was paired up with Lindsay Arnold, the champion of Season 25, who described her partner in a clip before their performance as dancing at a \u201cpre-pre-school level.\u201d She added: \u201cHe definitely isn\u2019t natural at it.\u201d\n\nBut Spicer seemed to have a blast. He attempted a salsa to The Spice Girls\u2019 \u201cSpice Up Your Life\u201d that end with a knee slide. Judge Bruno Tonioli said he looked like he was being attacked by a \u201cswarm of wasps.\u201d But judge Len Goodman said he admired Spicer\u2019s \u201ccourage.\u201d He scored 12 out of a possible 30 points.\n\nSpicer appeared to take it in dance stride. He said earlier in an interview that he just hoped to show another side of himself.\n\n\u201cMy tenure [in the White House] was very one-dimensional,\u201d he said before his performance. \u201cI sat up on a podium and looked like an angry leprechaun some days, yelling at people.\u201d Now people \u201cget to see a different side of me,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you walk away and you still don\u2019t like who I am, God bless you.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s rocking that neon flamingo shirt like a boss.
