Spoiler alert: it turns out chocolate really is the food of love. (Although banana bread works, too.)\n\nLiam\n\nAnything that shows that you put love into it. I think anyone is impressed if you took any time to mix eggs and flour and butter for them and put it in the oven.\n\nMary Lou\n\nA chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and chocolate decorations. That would definitely do it.\n\nChocolate anything was an overwhelmingly popular choice amongst the bakers. Chocolate really is the food of love.

Nobody can so no to it, and everybody falls in love every single time.\n\nColin\n\nI'd say the best baked good to win someone's heart is a cookie. Because you don't wanna be too aggressive. You don't wanna be like 'Hey! I made you a wedding cake!' A cookie is handheld, it's portable, it's like 'I spent time on this, but I don't want to marry you.' Or not yet, anyway.\n\nBetty\n\nSomething you bake with your heart.\n\nJay\n\nAnything chocolate. You can win somebody's heart with anything chocolate, but a chocolate creme brul\u00e9e? Totally.\n\nNataliia\n\nMy husband loves brownies. I think that's a good one.\n\nChris\n\nI think the best way to win a person's heart through a baked good is something like a chocolate souffl\u00e9e. It's like a big show.\n\nJodi\n\nI won the hubby over with some banana bread, so I'm gonna say banana bread.\n\nBanana bread: apparently a highly underrated seduction technique.

That feels like a good way to go.", "description": "Dating tips from the bakers of the Great Canadian Baking Show", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5250452.1565987361!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/647636812.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
