[YONHAP]\n\nThe leader of the ruling party issued a public apology on Wednesday over the recent political and social turmoil surrounding former Justice Minister Cho Kuk.\u201cAs the head of the ruling party, I feel heavily responsible,\u201d Chairman Lee Hae-chan of the Democratic Party (DP) said during a media conference at the National Assembly. \u201cI want to issue a sincere apology to the people.\u201dIt is Lee\u2019s first apology about the scandal-ridden Cho\u2019s appointment and subsequent resignation. Cho, nominated by President Moon Jae-in to head the Justice Ministry and a campaign to weaken the prosecution\u2019s powers, was appointed to the post in September despite fierce protests by opposition politicians and the prosecution\u2019s probes into his family\u2019s suspected corruption. He, however, resigned on Oct. 14, after only serving mere 35 days.\u201cBecause we were too preoccupied with the grand cause of the prosecutorial reform, we failed to understand the despair and frustration of the people, youngsters in particular, toward unfairness,\u201d Lee said.In his apology, Lee did not specifically mention Cho. The apology appeared to be an attempt by the ruling party to stop its young supporters\u2019 departure as they increasingly turned against the Moon administration and the DP following the Cho\u2019s scandals. Youngsters were particularly enraged by the rare opportunities for internships and extracurricular activities that only children of the power elites such as Cho\u2019s daughter have enjoyed for college admissions, deploring that they were against Moon\u2019s presidential pledge to build a \u201cfair society.\u201dLee\u2019s apology also seems to be a response to the growing demands from the reformists inside the DP that he must take some responsibility. \u201cIt is largely Lee\u2019s fault that the party is acting as if nothing happened,\u201d Rep. Rhee Cheol-hee recently said.\u201cThe latest crisis demonstrated once again the prosecution\u2019s high-handed way of wielding its powers,\u201d Lee said during the media conference. \u201cWe can also feel the people\u2019s strong desire to reform the prosecution.\u201dLee promised that the DP will exert all efforts to complete the reform measures such as the establishment of a new investigation agency for public servants.Meanwhile, the prosecution is continuing its investigation into the corruption allegations surrounding the Cho family. The prosecutors asked the Seoul Central District Court for the second time to issue a warrant to detain Cho\u2019s younger brother for further questioning into various criminal charges surrounding the Ungdong School, a middle school operated by the Cho family. The prosecution\u2019s first warrant request was denied earlier this month.Cho\u2019s younger brother was suspected of having received bribes in exchange for offering jobs to teachers at Ungdong School. The prosecution also suspects that he destroyed evidence and arranged a co-conspirator\u2019s flight to another country. The warrant hearing will take place today at 10:30 a.m. and the outcome is expected to be out late at night or early tomorrow.BY SER MYO-JA [ser.myoja@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/30195249.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
