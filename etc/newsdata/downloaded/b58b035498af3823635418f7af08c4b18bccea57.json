Yuan Council: Campaign Finance Board instructed voters to go to wrong polling sites\n\nCity Council members chastised the Campaign Finance Board Friday for sending out voter guides instructing New Yorkers to go to the wrong polling sites on Election Day.\n\nThe Campaign Finance Board oversees the city's public matching funds system and also frequently conducts voter education campaigns. As part of the latter process, it recently sent a mailer out across the five boroughs that contained outdated polling location information.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe guide was for Election Day sites, not early voting locations that open Saturday, but the result is that 150,000 voters were told to head to the wrong place.\n\n\"There is a tremendous amount of money that is being wasted here, and it is defeating the whole purpose of voting,\" Council Member Robert Holden said in an interview. \"Telling people to go to the wrong site? That's a fiasco.\u201d\n\nHolden was among several Council members Friday morning who issued a joint statement excoriating the board for the mistake, which the agency attributed to outdated polling location data.\n\n\u201cThe board is aware that some voter guides were mailed with outdated election day poll site information,\" said Matthew Sollars, spokesperson for the board, in a statement. \"Poll sites often change close to an election, which is why our guide always advises voters to check their site online before going to the polls.\"\n\nSollars added that, as the board has done previously, it mailed a postcard with corrected poll information to the voters who were affected at a cost of $17,000.\n\nBut why the CFB did not have current information was the subject of finger-pointing Friday morning. A spokesperson for the Board of Elections, a separate body in charge of selecting polling sites and generally carrying out electoral contests, said that the CFB requested polling site information in May \u2014 meaning the information was more than four months old by the time it made its way out to voters.\n\nThe CFB countered that it usually gets updated polling location information before it publishes its voter guide each year, but that it was denied that data this time around.\n\n\"Starting in 2017, we have included poll site information on the cover of the guide in cooperation with the BOE, which made updated poll site lists available to us in time to make the print run of the guide,\" Sollars said in his statement. \"For this election, despite several requests, an updated list was not shared until after their own mailing went out to voters and it was posted to their website.\u201d\n\nElected officials appeared to place the blame squarely on the finance board.\n\n\"The CFB really screwed this up,\" Council Member Justin Brannan told POLITICO in an email. \"As an elected official, I always want my constituents to have the information and tools they need to make informed decisions because knowledge is power.\"", "description": "The Campaign Finance Board oversees the city's public matching funds system and also frequently conducts voter education campaigns.", "authors": ["Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/c4/94/af76f8e04c1f8f657faa66e0e0e1/ny-voting.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
