Scorsese cracked that Rosenthal was \"translating\" for Pesci.\n\nWhen asked if he felt pressure to do the movie, Pesci had a bit more to say.\n\n\"I don't know what to say, I just, no, no pressure. Oh, to do this? No, you didn't say that,\" he replied.\n\nAs for Scorsese's directing style, Pesci said, \"I just do whatever he tells me to. Thank you for asking.\"\n\nPacino also came to wise crack, and De Niro was along for the ride, laughing.\n\nPacino admitted he thought the movie, 10 years in the works, was never going to happen, and that whenever he met with Scorsese he would ask if it was really getting made. Scorsese explained that Netflix eventually came through with the $150 million in financing the 108-day shoot required, and Pacino signed on, although Scorsese was never sure he actually read the script.\n\n\"I don't like reading film scripts,\" Pacino laughed.\n\n\"I don't read them,\" Pesci piped in.\n\nPacino said he admired De Niro's work in the movie, calling him a real \"Meryl Streep.\"\n\nWhen questions were turned over to the audience there was the sound of a can falling to the ground.\n\n\"They're drinking again,\" Scorsese cracked.\n\nAnd when it was silent for about a minute before anyone asked a question, the director feigned enthusiasm.\n\n\"Wow. What a crowd,\" he deadpanned.\n\nThe actors and Scorsese all received a standing ovation at the talk.\n\nThe film opens in theaters on November 1 and on Netflix on November 27.", "description": "Martin Scorsese must have an easier time wrangling Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci on-camera, because at a panel discussion for their new movie \"The Irishman,\" it was a comic free for all.", "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190930093615-joe-pesci-and-irishman-cast-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
