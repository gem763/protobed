(JenniferLynn Studios; Wheeler campaign)\n\nThe partisan backlash over inflammatory tweets that Virginia Republican John Gray tried to hide intensified Thursday, with Democrats calling on him to drop his candidacy for chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors.\n\nAt a news conference with several other Democrats who either represent the area or are seeking office, state Sen. Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) said the GOP \u201chas nominated a misogynistic, bigoted racist to lead the county government. . . . We don\u2019t need this anymore in our county.\u201d\n\nGray is seeking to succeed longtime county board Chairman Corey A. Stewart (R), who was criticized for inflammatory rhetoric and having ties to white nationalists during his recent runs for higher office. (Stewart cut ties to the white nationalists and said he had not been aware of their views.)\n\nThe campaign of Ann Wheeler, the Democrat running for board chair, recently found deleted tweets in which Gray used stereotypes to mock violence and political protest in African American communities and exhibit intolerance toward non-Christians.\n\nGray, whose campaign paid a scrubbing service $30 to delete several thousand tweets, apologized for some of the controversial posts and owned up to others. On Thursday, he did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nBut local GOP leaders and a few protesters at the news conference in Woodbridge defended Gray and called Democrats hypocritical for supporting Gov. Ralph Northam (D), who admitted wearing blackface decades ago, and Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, who was accused of sexual assault by two women. Fairfax denies the allegations.\n\n\u201cJohn Gray has rightly apologized for his disgusting past tweets,\u201d Jo Watts, vice chair of the county Republican Party committee, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHowever, it\u2019s hypocritical for the Prince William Democrats to focus on his mistakes when they give their leader, Governor Ralph Northam, a complete pass on his racist actions while taking his money,\u201d Watts said.\n\nFellow Republican D.J. Jordan, who is working to unseat Del. Elizabeth Guzman (D-Prince William), criticized Gray, saying the tweets conflict with his values.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all made mistakes in our past, but John has a lot of work to do to prove that he can be a leader of one of the most diverse counties in America,\u201d Jordan said in an email.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Democrats increased attacks against John Gray over tweets they say make him unfit to be county board chairman.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2TuGBanlgrQRNxWGG_-g0KAw1BM=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/S4OWHDU7I4I6TA7DIX663DUNFY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
