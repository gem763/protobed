He was speaking at a cabinet meeting in Tehran.\n\nAn Iranian government spokesman said Bolton\u2019s dismissal could help the US have a \u201cless biased\u201d attitude towards Tehran.\n\nHow will John Bolton's dismissal affect US foreign policy?

The US administration later intensified sanctions on Tehran, slashing its sales of crude oil abroad and sending the country\u2019s economy into freefall.\n\nIn response, Iran has crept past the limits the nuclear deal imposed on uranium enrichment and its uranium stockpile. Tehran announced at the weekend that it would use advanced centrifuges prohibited under the agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, attacks on oil tankers near the strait of Hormuz, the downing of a US military surveillance drone by Iran and other incidents across the wider Middle East have exacerbated the crisis in the region, as Tehran tries to put pressure on Europe to find a way to sell crude oil abroad despite US sanctions.\n\nRouhani has called the use of faster centrifuges a \u201cthird step\u201d away from the nuclear deal. On Wednesday, he said that \u201cif necessary, we will take other steps in future\u201d.", "description": "President Hassan Rouhani signals approval of firing of national security adviser", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d68f2492ebf42b81e6569b963b8af5a1f136cb/0_201_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=23b85117ab7d29363c0e81cad68ea129", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
