When Zuckerberg first testified before Congress in 2018 over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, some critics panned his testimony as robotic. But he emerged largely unscathed despite tough questioning.\n\nNow, he's again taking a more public role in defending his company, which faces a slew of challenges over its market power, privacy policies, an ambitious plan to launch a cryptocurrency, and in its latest controversy \u2014 scrutiny over how Facebook handles misleading or false political ads.\n\nCriticism of Facebook's rules has intensified after President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi arrives in Jordan with bipartisan congressional delegation Trump says his Doral resort will no longer host G-7 after backlash CNN's Anderson Cooper mocks WH press secretary over Fox News interview MORE\u2019s campaign ran an ad accusing former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenCNN's Anderson Cooper mocks WH press secretary over Fox News interview Yang cautions Democrats: Impeachment might not be 'successful' Ocasio-Cortez: Sanders' heart attack was a 'gut check' moment MORE without evidence of using his office to pressure Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into a company where his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board. Facebook declined to remove the ad.\n\nPresidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenTrump says his Doral resort will no longer host G-7 after backlash Ocasio-Cortez: Sanders' heart attack was a 'gut check' moment Ocasio-Cortez tweets endorsement of Sanders MORE (D-Mass.) has been particularly outspoken against the policy, saying it amounts to Facebook being a \u201cdisinformation-for-profit machine.\u201d Warren's campaign even ran an ad falsely claiming that Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump to draw attention to the controversy.\n\nFacebook has defended the policy, arguing it does not want to decide what political candidates are allowed to say.\n\nZuckerberg personally defended the policy at Georgetown, saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical ads can be an important part of voice, especially for local candidates and up and coming challengers that the media might not otherwise cover,\u201d he added later. \u201cBanning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also pushed back hard on calls to break up Facebook, a centerpiece of Warren's tech policies.\n\nBut the response to the speech also highlighted the challenges for Zuckerberg as he takes on a more public role.\n\nZuckerberg's remarks drew a sharp rebuke from Biden's campaign, which said the CEO's talk of free speech amounted to using \u201cthe Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd Bernice King also hit Zuckerberg for mentioning her father, Martin Luther King Jr., in discussing free speech.\n\n\u201cI'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d she tweeted Thursday. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nCritics of Facebook have dismissed Zuckerberg's latest outreach.\n\n\u201cThe reaction to his speech yesterday was largely negative, in some ways they\u2019re backed in a PR corner,\u201d said Sarah Miller, co-chairwoman of Freedom from Facebook, a coalition of progressive groups calling for breaking up the company. \u201cNo matter what they try, I think their press and reputation continues to suffer damage.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg has also met with a slew of lawmakers ahead of his return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when he will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook's cryptocurrency project, Libra.\n\nPolitico also reported this week that he has been meeting with several conservative figures, including Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamErdo\u011fan got the best of Trump, experts warn Graham: I'm seeking to make Trump successful 'but not at all costs' The Memo: Trump's sea of troubles deepens MORE (R-S.C.), Fox News host Tucker Carlson Tucker CarlsonNBC-Universal rejects outside investigation of Matt Lauer Megyn Kelly appearance on Fox News draws more than 4 million viewers The Hill's 12:30 Report: Hunter Biden speaks out amid Ukraine controversy MORE and others, many of who whom have accused Facebook of anti-conservative bias. Zuckerberg defended those meetings.\n\n\"Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning,\" Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. \"If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!\n\nZuckerberg has also sat down with lawmakers from both parties. Over three days in September he held a number of meetings in Washington, including with some of his company's toughest critics from both parties, such as Democratic Sens.

Warner told reporters this week he hopes Zuckerberg is \u201cmaking sure to continue to see people across the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nBut whether Zuckerberg's outreach will temper the anger at Facebook in Washington remains to be seen.\n\nThe CEO will face one high-profile test on Wednesday when he testifies before Waters's committee in what will be Zuckerberg's first testimony in Congress since the Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn 2018, Zuckerberg's appearance before Congress for two days of testimony was preceded by fervent anticipation. This time, Zuckerberg will be less of a mystery to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cHe probably sees himself as putting on a cape and coming to Washington,\u201d the former House counsel said.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is in the midst of a public relations blitz as criticism of the company he founded mounts in Washington.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/zuckerbergmark_101719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
