She finished with 13 points, hitting 5 of her 6 shots and played 26 minutes. She was clearly limited in her movement and stayed mostly on the perimeter, but was effective enough to command the attention of Connecticut\u2019s defense. That opened it up for Emma Meesseman and Kristi Toliver. Meesseman had 21 points, including nine to start the fourth quarter, and Toliver added 20 points and 10 assists. Washington will try and win the first championship in franchise history on Tuesday night with Game 4 in Connecticut.\n\nDelle Donne hit an early 3-pointer and the Mystics made six of their nine shots from behind the arc in the first quarter to take a 32-17 lead after 10 minutes.\n\nWashington led by as many as 17 points in the first half. It was 37-23 before the Sun went on a 16-4 run and Washington led 43-39 at the break.\n\nJonquel Jones converted a 3-point play to open the third quarter cut the lead to one, but that was as close as Connecticut would get.\n\nThey trailed by two when Delle Donne hit a 3-pointer from the left wing to make it 58-53. The Mystics took a 68-57 lead into the fourth quarter and stretched that to 18 before a final run by the Sun that Delle Donne ended with a tough layup.\n\nShekinna Stricklen and Jasmine Thomas each had 16 points for the Sun. Jones, who scored 32 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in Connecticut\u2019s Game 2 win, scored just nine points to go with her nine boards.\n\nCOPING\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Delle Donne, who averaged 19.5 points and 8.2 rebounds this season, left Tuesday\u2019s 99-87 Game 2 loss without scoring a point after playing only a few minutes in the first quarter. There were a few scary moments for her on Sunday. She went down to her knees for a loose ball just over five minutes into the game, was subbed out and went straight to the tunnel. But she returned a few minutes later. The team said it was part of the plan to keep her back warm by having her stretch with the trainers instead of sitting on the bench.\n\nREBOUNDS\n\nWashington outrebounded Connecticut 34-27 after being dominated on the boards, 41-27 in Game 2.\n\nTIP INS\n\nWashington: Delle Donne had had averaged 21.4 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Mystics\u2019 first five playoff games. She had scored at least 10 points in 23 straight playoff games before Tuesday.\n\nConnecticut: The Sun were 15-2 at home in the regular season and swept their two semi-final games here against Los Angeles. This was the first Finals game at the Mohegan Sun since they went to back-to-back in 2004 and 2005. That team was led by current Mystics coach Mike Thibault, who spent 10 years in Uncasville before being fired in 2012.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWashington can win its first WNBA championship on Tuesday night on this same court.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Elena Delle Donne put forth a gutsy effort, playing through a back injury, and Washington beat the Connecticut Sun 94-81 on Sunday and move within a victory of winning the franchise's first title.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pat Eaton-Robb"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/APTOPIX_Mystics_Sun_Basketball_17009.jpg-22281_c0-0-3900-2273_s1770x1032.jpg?75f3e88abe138da6ceec800e80a0ced71f3d83c5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
