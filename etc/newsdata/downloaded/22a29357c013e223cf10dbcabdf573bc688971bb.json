Mr. McDermott will act as an adviser until the end of the year, the company said.\n\nMr. McDermott became CEO in 2014 after rising through SAP's ranks, starting as the CEO of SAP America in 2002 and becoming co-CEO of the entire company in 2010. Prior to SAP, he had spent nearly two decades at Xerox Corp.\n\nActivist investor Elliott Management Corp. in April said it had taken a stake worth 1.2 billion euros ($1.32 billion) in SAP, calling the business-software company undervalued.\n\nSAP earlier this year announced a nearly $1 billion restructuring program, including plans to cut about 4,000 jobs. Three months later, in April, it announced plans to sharply boost earnings, which included more than tripling cloud-computing sales by the end of 2023. The new targets, along with the disclosure that Elliott had become an investor, spurred a rally in SAP's shares.\n\nSAP profitability, though, has lagged behind that of global peers. SAP's second-quarter earnings, announced in July, missed analysts' profit expectations, and shares retreated. The stock is down 14% in the past three months.\n\nMs. Morgan joined SAP in 2004 and most recently ran its cloud-computing business. Mr. Klein was SAP's chief operating officer.\n\nThe new chiefs take over at a time of intense competition for a slice of the fast-growing and lucrative cloud-computing and business-software market. More companies are choosing cloud-computing vendors and moving these functions online instead of doing them in-house, and are transitioning to new software tools in the process.\n\nSAP has struggled to keep pace with rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc., which has used acquisitions to expand its position in customer-relationship software. Salesforce now holds a 17% market share by sales compared with SAP's 5.6% share, according to International Data Corp. figures.\n\nSAP has also looked to acquisitions to bolster its ambitions. In 2014, it bought Concur Technologies, which makes software to manage employee expenses, for $8.3 billion. It also acquired SuccessFactors in 2011 for $3.4 billion, giving it a foothold in the area of cloud-based software for human-resources management.\n\nThough SAP has had a co-CEO structure before, power-sharing arrangements like that are rarely attempted at the top echelons of the corporate world because they can lead to conflict. Still, SAP rival Oracle Corp. had been using a similar setup until one of its CEOs, Mark Hurd, last month said he would take leave for medical reasons. Office-space rental firm We Co. last month also named two executives to replace founder and CEO Adam Neumann, who agreed to step down under pressure from the board.\n\nSAP Chairman Hasso Plattner called the work-sharing arrangement \"time-tested at SAP with multiple prior instances of success.\"\n\nMr. McDermott \"was a main driver of SAP's transition to the cloud, which will fuel our growth for many years to come,\" Mr. Plattner said. The decision to tap the co-CEOs as Mr. McDermott's eventual replacement was taken more than a year ago when each was given more responsibility, Mr. Plattner added.\n\nSAP on Thursday also announced preliminary third-quarter results, including per-share earnings of 1.04 euros ($1.14), beating analysts' expectations of 0.82 euros per share.\n\nThe strong earnings helped boost SAP's American depositary receipts by around 5% in after-hours trading.\n\nWrite to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 10, 2019 20:23 ET (00:23 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
