Former decathlon world-record holder Ashton Eaton used to describe how even a winning performance left a nagging frustration which drew him back in for more, hoping to squeeze those extra centimetres, those milliseconds which would drip out a few more points. This is the thing about heptathlon; you can never really complete it. The world record still stands at a ridiculous 7,291 points, set by Jackie Joyner-Kersee at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, and so perhaps it helps to have the mentality of the reigning world and Olympic champion Nafi Thiam, who doesn\u2019t really see impossible as a limit so much as a target.\n\n\u201cI think the interesting thing about the heptathlon is that you have so many things to handle at the same time,\u201d says Thiam, sitting in an old rickety stand overlooking her training track in Liege. \u201cYou try to do a perfect heptathlon. The goal is to do a heptathlon where you do personal bests everywhere and it\u2019s almost impossible. If I could do in all my PBs in one heptathlon that would be incredible, and it would be a very high score, I think. Even just six PBs that would be really high, but like I say, it\u2019s almost impossible. But I hope I can do that one day, that\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nIf multi-discipline sport is the purest test of athletic ability then there\u2019s an argument to say Thiam is the best female athlete on the planet. Aged 25, she already has the third highest heptathlon score in history as one of only four women to have broken the 7,000 points barrier. She could compete in most of the seven events individually but her jumping is exceptional, with a high jump PB of 2.02m only 7cm short of the 30-year-old world record. In a few days\u2019 time in Doha she could add \u2018world champion 2019\u2019 to her extensive list of titles, and as if to drive home the point, last week she completed an undergraduate degree in geography. She\u2019s weighing up a masters in territorial planning, of course, but that can wait for now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really long six years so I\u2019m happy I finished it.\u201d When Thiam began her degree at the University of Liege, there were plenty of critics on hand to warn her that studying would detract from her athletic achievements. Was she pleased to prove them wrong? \u201cYeah, I think so. Not that I was trying to, I didn\u2019t care, but I think I showed it\u2019s possible to get to a very high level and that also to do something on the side can also be beneficial, because I think it\u2019s really healthy along with athletics to have study on the side.\u201d\n\nBy most standards this year should have been a struggle: alongside her studies she battled a slew of injuries, yet still set personal bests in the long jump, high jump, 200m and shot put, to even her own astonishment. \u201cIt was a very weird year because I had a few problems physically, but whenever I went back to competition it was always really really great for my personal PBs. I was a bit surprised about that but I try not to really think about it or try to find a reason. I\u2019m just feeling good so I just go with it.\u201d\n\nThiam is one of the best high jumpers in the world (Getty) More\n\nThe terrifying part for rivals like Britain\u2019s Katarina Johnson-Thompson is that Thiam might yet get better. She already has the optimum physical attributes for an all-round athlete, standing tall at 6ft 2ins with springs in her legs and a deceptively powerful upper body, and leaving her degree behind has given her the gift of time to hone her craft.\n\nStory continues", "description": "There is something addictive about multi-discipline events like heptathlon.
