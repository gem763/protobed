I really only wanted this all to stop, to disappear.\u201d\n\nHer GP instantly put her on Prozac, Valium and antidepressants. \u201cThose meds helped, but didn\u2019t fix the problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was also referred for a six-week CBT course, which was great, but it was only six weeks.\n\n\u201cAt the end I was on my own again, and knowing how limited that support was I was terrified how I\u2019d cope alone.\u201d\n\nBut it was through an online forum for dog rescuers \u2013 a cause Andrea, 52, helps with \u2013 that she found her salvation.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\u201cThree women I\u2019d never met in person became my \u2018tribe\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cOne was in Kent, one was in North Wales, and one was in France.\n\n\"They quickly picked up what I was going through and they\u2019d regularly text or message to simply ask how I was, if I had enough money to eat, if I\u2019d been out that day.\n\n\u201cThe relentless, unquestioning love they showed me in my hour of need saved me.\u201d\n\nCrucially, she says, they helped her deal with the practical problems she faced.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t think straight, so they\u2019d help me with finding somewhere to stay, paying off debts \u2013 things I could have done easily before but which were now contributing to thoughts of wanting to take my own life.\n\n\u201cThey kept me physically alive. I felt like I was climbing a slag heap in flip-flops \u2013 all I needed was someone beside me to lean on and I could make it, but without that it was one step forwards, five steps backwards.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThen in September 2017 Andrea felt she could take no more, and set out into the woods with her dog to end it all.\n\nBut in that moment of desperation, she found her reason to carry on \u2013 and a mission to help others.\n\nAndrea said: \u201cI thought of my son having to carry on without me, how this would affect him. It smacked me in the face.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018What are you doing? What has he done to deserve this?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe vowed that with her three friends\u2019 support she would get better and, if she did, she would in turn become the one helping others who were going through similarly hard times.\n\nSo last April she started on a City and Guilds course to become an accredited Suicide Prevention Tutor \u2013 a course paid for by her friend in France.\n\nAnd now Andrea \u2013 no longer taking antidepressants \u2013 has found a new role going into big corporations to deliver mental health training. The theme of this year\u2019s Mental Health Day \u2013 which fell on Thursday \u2013 was suicide prevention, something very close to her heart.\n\nShe said: \u201cI saw a Facebook memory flash up from two years ago on which I posted \u2018Today is not a day worth living\u2019.\n\n\u201cI feel so proud and so lucky I\u2019ve come back from that cliff edge, to where I now feel I have something to contribute, something to live for. I was a high-flyer with a big income \u2013 I know nobody is immune to depression and suicidal thoughts. I\u2019m a survivor, not a victim.\n\n\u201cI now have a new home, a new career I love, a new life. But I know so many people right now are going through what I did \u2013 and need help.\u201d", "description": "Andrea Newton\u00a0 was diagnosed with depression and found herself living on people's sofas - but she was helped by her online angels", "authors": ["Matthew Barbour", "Image", "Liverpool Echo Ws", "Getty Images", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20565721.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_St-Helens-named-Englands-suicide-capital-with-record-numbers-taking-their-own-lives.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
