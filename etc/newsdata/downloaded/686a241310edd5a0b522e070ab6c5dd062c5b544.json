whistleblower and White House staffers who reportedly provided them with information about the call, saying those officials were \u201cclose to a spy\u201d.\n\n\"I want to know who's the person, who's the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\" Mr Trump said, according to Los Angeles Times. \"You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\"\n\nThe White House released a five-page memorandum of the phone call in question, in which Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky \u201cto do us a favour,\u201d before discussing Mr Biden.\n\nMr Trump had reportedly withheld nearly $400m (\u00a3327.3m) in financial aid to the country just days before he spoke with Mr Zelensky, a move House Democrats have suggested was reflective of a quid pro quo on the part of the US president.\n\n\u201cI have received information from multiple US Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 US election,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President\u2019s main domestic political rivals.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

One White House official described this act as an abuse of the electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\u201d\n\nMr Trump has continued to ramp up his attacks against the anonymous whistleblower, who reportedly was a member of the US intelligence community previously assigned to the White House, as Democrats have accelerated their impeachment inquiry and investigation against him.\n\nHouse committees issued subpoenas to the president's personal attorney a day before his latest tweets directed at the whistleblower, demanding all documents and records involving Ukraine.", "description": "Donald Trump has demanded to be able to interview and \"learn everything about \" an\u00a0anonymous whistleblower whose report of his telephone call with the president of Ukraine has triggered an impeachment inquiry.
