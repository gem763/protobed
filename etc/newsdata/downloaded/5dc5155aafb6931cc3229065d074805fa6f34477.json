Countless creams, lotions and potions flood the market, promising to minimize the signs of age. Plastic surgeons and med-spas are never at a loss for business. These will never go away. All people\u2014men and women\u2014want to look and feel young and vibrant, no matter what their \u201creal\u201d age.\n\nBut while these treatments address the surface signs of aging, research reveals that the real secret to turning back the hands of time is addressing a phenomenon that occurs at the cellular level: senescence.\n\nWhat Is Senescence?\n\nDuring our younger years, our bodies are efficiently able to eliminate cells that become senescent\u2014damaged, dysfunctional, and no longer able to divide and multiply as they normally do. The body destroys senescent cells in a process known as apoptosis (programmed cell death), and then they\u2019re disposed of by the immune system.\n\nAs we age, though, more and more of our cells become senescent at a faster pace. This typically happens as a result of DNA/telomere damage or oxidative stress.\n\nThe problem is, our immune system also tends to decline with age and becomes less effective. When this happens, more and more senescent cells escape apoptosis and elimination, which causes them to accumulate in the body.\n\nResearch is starting to realize that senescent cell accumulation is one of the main causes of aging and a major reason we start to develop so-called age-related diseases such as osteoarthritis, cancer, vision loss, neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, and heart disease.\n\nThis is because senescent cells, sometimes referred to as \u201czombie cells\u201d, not only stop functioning normally, contributing to the greater good of your body as a whole, they instead release protein-degrading enzymes and pro-inflammatory signals.\n\nAs you know, chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for a multitude of diseases.\n\nTo make matters worse, the inflammatory signals sent out by \u201czombie\u201d cells can negatively impact surrounding healthy cells, causing them to prematurely enter into a senescent state. It\u2019s a cycle that perpetuates and accelerates aging, illness, and disease.\n\nFortunately, studies show that a novel approach called senotherapeutics can help to clear out these problematic cells and therefore lower risk of disease.1\n\nAbout Senotherapeutics\n\nSenotherapeutics are medicines or compounds that selectively target senescent cells. They work by either suppressing their inflammatory effects (senomorphics) or killing senescent cells (senolytics). Specifically, senolytics work by \u201cturning off\u201d the pathway that prevents apoptosis and \u201cturning on\u201d the signals that lead to cellular death. As a result, senescent cells can be safely eliminated from the body without harming any healthy cells.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nPreliminary studies using mice show that the use of senotherapeutics decreases disease risk. Studies show that removing senescent cells can delay or slow the progression of certain diseases. In one, the removal of senescent cells led to inhibition of arterial plaque in mice with atherosclerosis. 2-3\n\nQuercetin and Fisetin as Senolytics\n\nPreliminary research appears to show that the bioflavonoid quercetin, when combined with other senolytics, is able to release senescent cells from the body. Quercetin is a plant pigment found in the skins of grapes, onions, and apples. Supplemental quercetin has long been used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, and it\u2019s also a powerful natural allergy fighter.\n\nIn a study released in 2018, researchers at the Mayo Clinic found that quercetin, combined with the chemotherapy agent dasatinib, cleared senescent cells from mice.5\n\nThey injected young, four-month-old mice with either senescent cells or non-senescent cells (the control group). Just two weeks later, the mice with senescent cells started showing signs of aging\u2014impaired function, including decreased strength, endurance, speed, activity level, food intake, and body weight.\n\nBoth sets of mice were treated for three days the with quercetin/dasatinib combination. They found that the therapy \u201cselectively killed senescent cells and slowed the deterioration in walking speed, endurance, and grip strength\u201d in the senescent mice.\n\nOlder, 20-month-old mice were also tested with the treatment combo. Those mice experienced improved physical function, faster walking speed, and better grip strength.\n\nWhen very old mice (24-27 months old) were given the quercetin/dasatinib therapy biweekly, it led to a 36 percent higher average life span, indicating that senolytics can lower risk of death.\n\nOther research has shown that a flavonoid in strawberries, fisetin, also acts as a senolytic agent. Old mice treated with it displayed \u201crestored tissue homeostasis, reduced age-related pathology, and extended median and maximum lifespan.\u201d5\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nResearch into senolytics is still so young, and there\u2019s years\u2014perhaps decades\u2014of work to be done before any definitive answers can be provided. But the early results are so promising that it\u2019s worth taking advantage of the senolytic agents we do have at our disposal.\n\nObviously, chemotherapy agents are not available over the counter, so the average Joe cannot start using a quercetin/dasatinib therapy on his own. Not to mention, chemo drugs come with their own list of side effects.\n\nHowever, both fisetin and quercetin supplements are readily available online and at almost all health food stores and pharmacies. There\u2019s no definitive proof that these supplements will reverse the aging process, but for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects alone, they are worth adding into your supplement regimen. Use as directed.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
