REUTERS/Rebecca Naden/Files\n\nArgentina have been cranking up the passion play for a game they have to win to stay in the competition but England coach Eddie Jones said on Friday that his players would have to keep their cool and avoid being dragged into a heated battle.\n\n\u201cI think you have got to be smart. Rugby is a tough, physical game and the passion and pride come out in the toughness whenever you play,\u201d he told journalists at the Tokyo Stadium.\n\n\u201cThey base their game on the scrum, it is their manlihood, so you have got to take them up front, which is the scrum, the maul, the ruck attack and ruck defence. That is where it is going to be won.\n\n\u201cBut then there is also emotional control because when you have a lot of passion and pride it tends to multiply your strengths and multiply your weaknesses. We obviously want to multiply our strengths and attack their weaknesses.\u201d\n\nEngland\u2019s chief weakness over the last couple of years has been an inability to stem the tide when rivals get up an emotional head of steam - seen most notably in this year\u2019s Six Nations in the 21-13 defeat by Wales in a seething Cardiff bearpit and in Scotland\u2019s amazing second-half comeback from 31-0 down as England froze in the headlights en route to an incredible 38-38 Twickenham draw.\n\nRather than trying to take the heat out of such situations, captain and ultimate competitor Owen Farrell too often appeared to find an even higher gear of aggression - something he and Jones have been working to put behind him while encouraging others in the \u201cleadership group\u201d to find their voice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone very well (as captain) over last 12 months and every day he gets a bit better,\u201d Jones said of Farrell, who took over as skipper from his original choice, hooker Dylan Hartley.\n\nThe \u201cnew England\u201d Jones has spent almost four years honing to be judged on the next five weeks need to find a way to be cool, calm and calculating and trust that their power and skill will bring them through even if things are looking tricky for a while.\n\n\u201cArgentina play with a lot of pride, a lot of passion and this will be multiplied by the fact that they are in a game that is very important for them,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe Australian added that his coaching team had worked hard on creating training situations to equip the players to deal with such situations but recognised that no amount of work in the peaceful pastures of their Pennyhill Park training base can prepare them for the real thing with a team\u2019s World Cup future entirely dependent on their next 80 minutes of rugby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a tea-bag isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how good it is until you put it in hot water.\u201d", "description": "England will give everything they have to match Argentina's physicality in their World Cup clash on Saturday but they also plan to show something of a stiff upper lip in the face of what they expect to be a fiery and emotional Puma side.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436947660&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930KI", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
