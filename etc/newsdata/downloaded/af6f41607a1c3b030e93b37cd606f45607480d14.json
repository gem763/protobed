Although earnings did not meet analysts\u2019 expectations, the company provided ambitious guidance for the 2020 fiscal year, setting the stage for it to become the first marijuana grower to post revenue figures that could top the US$1-billion (C$1.3 billion) mark.\n\nThe projection puts the marijuana grower on a sharp upward trajectory that will firmly establish it among the largest tier-one cannabis companies in North America, especially now that Canopy Growth (NYSE: ), (TSX: )\u2014which had previously projected revenues to hit the $1-billion plateau\u2014is scaling back its outlook to a more modest level.\n\n\n\n\n\nCuraleaf price chart\n\nCuraleaf, which operates in 12 states, provided guidance that it expects to generate between US$1 billion and US$1.2 billion in revenue in the next fiscal year. The company did add, however, that these targets are based on finalizing two major acquisitions\u2014the purchase of Select and .\n\nMajor Acquisitions\n\nIn May, Curaleaf announced the takeover of the Select brand from Cura Partners Inc. in an all-stock transaction valued at US$ 948.8 million (C$1.27 billon). Select is regarded as the best known wholesale cannabis brand in the U.S. The deal includes Select\u2019s manufacturing, processing, distribution, marketing and retail operations that contains a network of 900 retail outlets in California, Arizona, Oregon and Nevada.\n\nThen, later in July, Curaleaf announced the US$875 million (C$1.68 billion) takeover of GR Companies Inc., commonly referred to as Grassroots, the largest private multi-state cannabis company in the United States. When completed, the cash and stock deal would make Curaleaf the largest marijuana company in the U.S. and the largest in the world by revenue. The deal would also expand Curaleaf\u2019s base of operations to 19 states.\n\nBut both these deals are currently being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s anti-trust regulators.\n\nImpressive Revenue Growth\n\nDespite the big headline, Curaleaf\u2019s Q2 earnings should not be overlooked. It reported an impressive 231% year-over-year growth in actual revenue, hitting just shy of US$48.5 million (C$64.7 million) for the three-month period ending June 30, 2019. In the same quarter in 2018, revenues were $14.6 million (C$19.5 million). Total revenues for Q2 2019 increased 38% compared to the previous quarter.\n\nNet losses also increased, coming in at US$24.5 million (C$32.7 million), compared to US$4.93 million (C$6.6 million) in the corresponding quarter in 2018, and US$10.2 million (C$13.6 million) the previous quarter.\n\nBut when you stack it all up against the other big players in the sector\u2014especially the biggest cannabis company in Canada and the largest by market cap in the world, Canopy Growth\u2014 Curaleaf begins to take on more street cred.\n\nIf its latest deals can get past the hurdles of the U.S. Justice Department review, it will be a company to watch as we head into the second half of fiscal 2019.\n\nCanadian Weed Output Doubles Since Legalization\n\nSince cannabis was legalized in Canada last October, the amount of licensed weed produced has doubled. That was among one of the findings in Statistics Canada's latest monthly updates released last Friday.\n\nIn June, the cannabis sector produced C$7.78 billion (US$5.83 billion). The country\u2019s black market cannabis market shrank by about 21% since legalization, StatsCan estimates.\n\nGrowing Licenses Issued In Israel\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Health has issued seven new medical cannabis growing licenses under the country\u2019s new reform of the industry. The permits are expected to triple the supply of medical cannabis available, with product supplying pharmacies by the end of the year, according to a report by Calcalist.\n\nIn order to help regulate the industry, the Israeli reforms will prohibit the sale of cannabis directly to individuals. All medical cannabis products must be sold at pharmacies.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Brenda O'Farrell/Investing.com) covering: Canopy Growth Corp, Curaleaf Holdings Inc.
