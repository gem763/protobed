In September 1988 and 2002, similar weather patterns produced atypically small ozone holes, she said.\n\nBy the numbers: NASA and NOAA satellite measurements show the annual ozone hole reached its peak extent of 6.3 million square miles on Sept. 8, and then shrank to less than 3.9 million square miles for the rest of the month through October.\n\n\"During years with normal weather conditions, the ozone hole typically grows to a maximum area of about 8 million square miles in late September or early October.\"\n\n\u2014 NASA statement\n\nBut, but, but: There is still reason to cheer at the news. NASA scientist Paul Newman told AP it means there's more ozone covering the Southern Hemisphere and \"less ultraviolet radiation at the surface.\"\n\nNASA says the 1987 treaty the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, signed by almost 200 countries to regulate the consumption and production of ozone-depleting compounds, is also starting to have a positive impact.\n\nThe ozone hole over Antarctica is expected to gradually become less severe as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which used to be found in refrigerators and aerosols but were banned under the protocol, are declining. \"Scientists expect the Antarctic ozone to recover back to the 1980 level around 2070,\" NASA said.\n\nGo deeper: Chinese factories are using banned ozone-depleting chemicals", "description": "It\u2019s not a sign that the ozone's on a \"fast track to recovery,\" NASA warns.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/s07mJb3epCRrwdwSytg8vICKSG8=/0x340:1282x1061/1920x1080/2019/10/24/1571900125772.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
