But with Keenum sidelined for the afternoon, Haskins was able to further develop.\n\nCallahan said he has been pleased with the 22-year-old\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s invaluable for a backup to take starting reps, especially at the beginning of the week in terms of putting your plan together and laying it out there and making all the adjustments, whether it\u2019s new communication, new formations, handling the shift-motion game,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI thought he did a really good job today, so his growth is starting to show in practice and also in his preparation. He\u2019s in earlier, he\u2019s out later, so it\u2019s all coming to fruition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a little time, but it\u2019s good to see him take a major step today in practice.\u201d\n\nKeenum was inconsistent in his return to the lineup Sunday against the Miami Dolphins. He completed just 52% of his passes, but threw for two touchdowns. After Washington\u2019s win, Callahan said he saw enough in Keenum for the 31-year-old to start again next week.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Miami, Keenum described his performance as \u201creally ugly,\u201d saying he has to improve. Miami almost pulled off a last-second upset, but failed to convert a game-winning two-point conversion at the end of the game.\n\nThat could have been avoided entirely if Keenum and the offense had put up more points.\n\n\u201cThe receivers did a great job,\u201d Keenum said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get the ball to them in key situations and not make it as interesting as it was.\u201d\n\nKeenum, though, isn\u2019t in jeopardy of losing his job. Instead, the Redskins are letting him rest. He suffered a foot injury in Week 3 against the Chicago Bears and hasn\u2019t been fully healthy since.\n\nWednesday also marked the first time that Keenum was listed with a shoulder injury.\n\nKeenum wasn\u2019t the only veteran who got a day off Wednesday. Running back Adrian Peterson (quad) and cornerback Josh Norman (thigh and hand) also missed practice to rest.\n\nCallahan said resting Keenum was \u201cstrictly\u2019 for the quarterback\u2019s benefit, not so Haskins could get the reps.\n\nIt is an added bonus, however.\n\nRookie wide receiver Terry McLaurin, who was also Haskins\u2018 teammate at Ohio State, said the first-rounder is getting more comfortable in the huddle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s speaking more clear and more concise,\u201d McLaurin said. \u201cSo I feel like he\u2019s visualizing things a lot better. He\u2019s making the plays that need to be made on the practice field. He\u2019s controlling what he can control. \u2026 Obviously he wants to be out there, but whether he\u2019s taking first-team reps or scout-team reps, he\u2019s treating that like a game-like situation.\n\n\u201cI feel like that is only going to help his development. \u2026 I have all the confidence in the world that Dwayne is going to get to where he needs to get.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
