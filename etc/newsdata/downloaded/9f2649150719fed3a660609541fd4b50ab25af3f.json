Musk said that this wasn\u2019t \u201cfor sure\u201d \u2014 but that he thinks Tesla is on track for the release.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of limited beta test, so there won\u2019t be a bunch of Tesla vehicles driving around autonomously by the end of the year. Musk later clarified on the call that by \u201cfeature complete,\u201d he means the car will be able to drive from someone\u2019s home to their work without intervention. Drivers will still need to be ready to take control if the car runs into a problem. Some experts have taken issue with the way Musk talks about these features in the past, arguing he is muddying the waters by overselling a Tesla car\u2019s capabilities.\n\nMusk says the car will be able to drive from someone\u2019s home to their work without intervention\n\nMusk said Tesla Autopilot can handle high-speed driving, while its recently rolled out Smart Summon parking feature can handle low speeds. (How well Smart Summon works is up for debate, given the number of Tesla owners reporting bugs in the system.) The company has yet to allow its customers hands-off control of the vehicle at medium speeds, where they are more likely to encounter traffic signals, intersections, and other complexities. FSD is meant to address that gap in Tesla\u2019s current autonomous capabilities.\n\nThere will be limits, Musk cautioned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean like every scenario everywhere on Earth, including every corner case,\u201d he said. That contradicts previous statements by Musk. Earlier this year, Musk said Tesla\u2019s vehicles will be able to achieve Level 5 autonomy \u201cwithout a geofence,\u201d which means they can drive anywhere, under any conditions.\n\nTesla has said it will activate its FSD feature by mid-2020, so today\u2019s comments indicate the company is feeling bullish about its capabilities. Tesla has an early access program for select drivers that it uses as a testing platform to help iron out software bugs.\n\nMusk previously estimated that by the middle of 2020, Tesla\u2019s autonomous system will have improved to the point where drivers will not have to pay attention to the road. The company also plans to roll out autonomous taxis in some parts of the US. The service will allow Tesla owners to add their cars to a Tesla network, which he said would be akin to Uber or Airbnb.\n\nIn the call, Musk said even as the company begins to activate a feature-complete version of its FSD feature to early access members, it won\u2019t mean the car will be fully full self-driving. Drivers will need to stay engaged until the end of 2020 at the earliest, Musk said.\n\nDrivers will need to stay engaged until the end of 2020 at the earliest, Musk said\n\nTesla brought back the FSD package earlier this year after shelving the option in late 2018 amid criticism the company was overselling the autonomy of its vehicles. Earlier this year Musk showed off the custom chip that Tesla will use to tackle this task, though he is well-known for missing his own deadlines.\n\nCustomers who are buying a Tesla have the option of purchasing the company\u2019s FSD option for $6,000, or $8,000 after delivery. (The company raised prices by $1,000 in August; Musk has said prices will continue to go up every few months.)\n\nMusk has long argued that Tesla\u2019s self-driving advantage comes from having a large fleet of vehicles \u2014 around 425,000 \u2014 already on the road. Those cars record situations and provide training data to improve the neural networks needed for self-driving cars. The company\u2019s approach to autonomous vehicles is primarily focused on computer vision, or using cameras \u2014 just like humans \u2014 to recognize and understand the world.\n\n\u201cWe will have more than one million robotaxis on the road,\u201d Musk said earlier this year. \u201cA year from now, we\u2019ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software... everything.\u201d", "description": "Tesla may allow certain customers early access to a \"feature complete\" version of the company\u2019s \"full self-driving\" capabilities by the end of 2019, Elon Musk said in a call with investors Wednesday.
