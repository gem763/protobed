What's going to happen in the interval and will there be elections in Great Britain?\"\n\nFrance's minister for European affairs, Amelie de Montchalin, said: \"At the end of the week we'll see whether a purely technical extension of a few days is justified, to allow the British parliament to finish its procedure.\"\n\nAmbassadors from EU member states were to meet later Wednesday in Brussels to begin the decision-making procedure, but no immediate response was expected.\n\n- Delay everything -\n\n\"My impression is the meeting will serve to have a first picture where individual member states stand,\" an EU diplomat told AFP.\n\n\"The position of Tusk is known, but some others want a short-term extension,\" he said.\n\nTusk wants the EU leaders to approve the January 31 extension \"by written procedure\", but -- officials said -- if the members' positions are far apart an emergency summit could be held on Monday next week.\n\nAs it stands, without their unanimous agreement, Britain is due to crash out of the EU in eight days' time.\n\nOn Tuesday, Johnson told MPs that if parliament decided to \"delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\n\"We will have to go forward to a general election. I will argue at that election: let's get Brexit done.\"\n\nA three-month delay would give time to hold a general election before the New Year -- though calling the vote would require the support of two-thirds of MPs.\n\nThe Labour main opposition has spurned two previous chances to call an election.\n\nThe Britain Elects poll aggregator puts the Conservatives on 35 percent, Labour on 25 percent, the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats on 18 percent, the Brexit Party on 11 percent and the Greens on four percent.\n\nPolling expert John Curtice told BBC radio that the polls are moving in favour of Johnson's Conservatives -- who are 33 seats short of a majority.\n\n\"If that were to be replicated in the ballot box, it should give them an overall majority, maybe around 20 or so\" seats.\n\n- 46 years of integration -\n\nLondon's stock market steadied at the open Wednesday and the pound was stable against the dollar and euro on expectations of a further delay.\n\nBusinesses and markets on both sides of the Channel fear a no-deal scenario, where Britain severs ties with its closest trading partner with no new plans in place after 46 years of integration.\n\nIn the June 2016 EU membership referendum, 52 percent of voters in the UK backed leaving the bloc.\n\nMPs three times rejected a divorce deal struck by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May.\n\nJohnson, who took office in July, defied expectations in striking a revised deal last Thursday -- and seemed relieved that MPs voted positively for it to be considered further.\n\nIt covers EU citizens' rights, Britain's financial settlements, a post-Brexit transition period until at least the end of 2020 and new trade arrangements for Northern Ireland.\n\nIt also sets out vague plans for a loose free trade agreement with the EU after Brexit.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson could pivot towards a general election as the EU mulls granting a Brexit deadline extension on Wednesday, after a fresh twist to the divorce saga cast doubt over his hopes of leaving on October 31.
