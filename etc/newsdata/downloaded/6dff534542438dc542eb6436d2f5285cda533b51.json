Both parties should get a grip! Good lord!'\n\nThe Leave.EU campaign group said it is developing a strategic voting app to help Brexit voters know who to vote for\n\nThe chances of a pact between Mr Farage and Mr Johnson appear slim after the Brexit Party leader said the PM's deal 'is just not Brexit'\n\nThe chances of Mr Farage and Mr Johnson agreeing an electoral alliance where one party would step aside for the other in certain seats to maximise Brexiteer chances of victory appear slim.\n\nMr Farage tweeted last night: 'If the PM wants to fight a general election on defending a new EU treaty, that is very disappointing for all Leavers.\n\n'His new agreement is just not Brexit.'\n\nThe growing pressure on the two men to strike an accord came as it was claimed that a pro-Brexit rally scheduled to take place outside Parliament on the planned divorce date of October 31 has been cancelled.\n\nThe Leave Means Leave campaign group had apparently been planning a repeat of the protests seen in the run up to March 29 when Brexit was first delayed.\n\n", "description": "Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson have been told by Brexit campaigners to 'get their sh** together' and agree an election pact to avoid splitting the Leave vote at a forthcoming snap poll.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320126-0-image-a-7_1572345180131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
