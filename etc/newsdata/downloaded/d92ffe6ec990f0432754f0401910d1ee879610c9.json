Yet I cannot help but notice that crypto sold off heavily following the announcement of impeachment proceedings whilst stocks was in freefall. This is the complete opposite you\u2019d pay for Bitcoin which has been touted as a digital safe-haven currency. But, more interestingly, Bitcoin\u2019s safe-haven appeal appears to have diminished since CNY broke above 7. Again, not sure if these elements are connected, but the sequence of events has caught my attention. But is certainly something to consider going forward whilst CNY remains weak, and Trump struggles to fight a trade war (or generally do anything) whilst he\u2019s hampered by impeachment proceedings.\n\nBTC/USD Daily Chart\n\nClosing the session down a casual -12%, it\u2019s not been a great day for the Bitcoin bull camp. From a technical standpoint, it\u2019s broken to the downside of the symmetrical triangle and sliced through the $9k support zone like butter. Moreover, it was a high-volume bearish session which suggests it\u2019s not a low-liquidity glitch, and there could be further losses to come.\n\nNow we\u2019ve not seen a daily range at or above 20% since the end of June, which was one day after its 2019 peak. And subsequent price action has played out as suggested in prior analysis.\n\n\u201cFlicking back through the chart, these levels of volatility [at or above 20% daily ranges] have generally been associated with, downtrends, deep corrections or periods ahead of a crash\u201d.\n\nSo, for now, we\u2019ll stick with the bearish channel thesis which could indeed bottom out before the bullish trend resumes.\n\nBTC/USD 60 Min Chart\n\nSwitching to the hourly chart, prices are behaving in the usual shell-shocked fashion we\u2019d expect after an explosive move. The market needs to catch a breath, and price action may not play so nicely over the near-term.\n\nBears could seek a dead-cat bounce and look to enter when volatility has subsided. Or see if resistance holds around $9k which was prior support and where the 38.2% Fibonacci level resides.\n\nand look to enter when volatility has subsided. which was prior support and where the 38.2% Fibonacci level resides. Alternatively, if a deeper retracement unfolds, traders could look to see if the lower triangle holds as resistance around the 61.8% Fibonacci level holds although that would be one to consider on a higher timeframe such as the daily or perhaps the four-hour chart.\n\naround the 61.8% Fibonacci level holds although that would be one to consider on a higher timeframe such as the daily or perhaps the four-hour chart. The 8,100 low is the initial target, a break of which confirms bearish resumption of the trend. The YTD low at 7,455 and the lower channel then come into focus for bears.\n\nCrypto Markets\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
