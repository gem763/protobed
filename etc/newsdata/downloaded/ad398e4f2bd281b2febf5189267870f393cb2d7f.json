As Watchfinder & Co. points out, however, there's currently one watch in particular that could be the next best cost-effective investment for watch enthusiasts: the Rolex Sky-Dweller 326933.\n\nIn 2012, Rolex released the Rolex Sky-Dweller, its first new watch in almost 20 years. The model was also Rolex's most technical watch to date, as it included a clever annual calendar feature and an extremely complicated movement that took into account specific months that have 30 days instead of 31. The watch received heightened attention because of its features, but since it carried a gold finish, it was too expensive and many turned to Patek Philippe for its similar model instead. \"Damned by its own excellence,\" notes Watchfinder & Co.\n\nIn 2017 Rolex re-released the model using steel instead of gold. Interest and sales soared with the help of its new accessible price point, but the steel and gold version of the model, the Rolex Sky-Dweller 326933, ended up going unnoticed by most as it fell at a price point in between gold and steel. In the video above, Watchfinder & Co. explains the rocky journey of the Rolex Sky-Dweller and why the once overlooked 326933 model could be the best watch investment right now.\n\nElsewhere in watches, a rare Rolex Daytona 6241 \"Paul Newman\" was recently found on a $25 USD thrift-store couch.", "description": "Online luxury watch reseller Watchfinder & Co. thinks it could be the most cost-effective investment for watch enthusiasts right now.", "authors": ["Emily Engle"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da9faf14af9096abf61bb62?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
