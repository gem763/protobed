Although the agenda precludes XRP price, many see this as a further opportunity for Garlinghouse to address concerns over XRP dumping, which some attribute to price stagnation in the divisive token.\n\nWill Garlinghouse Address The Issue Of Ripple Dumping XRP?\n\nThought leaders and attendees will gather in Washington DC on October 21-24 to deliberate all matters fintech. This year\u2019s event includes notable industry movers and shakers, such as SEC Chair, Jay Clayton and ConsenSys founder, Joe Lubin. But none more prominent than Brad Garlinghouse.\n\nGarlinghouse recently took to Twitter to address concerns over Ripple\u2019s quarterly sales of XRP, which some believe is the cause of poor price performance this year. He defended the sales by saying:\n\n\u201cXRP sales are about helping expand XRP\u2019s utility \u2013 building RippleNet & supporting other biz building w/XRP ie Dharma & Forte. Reality is we DECREASED our sales by volume Q/Q and since then the inflation rate of XRP circulating supply has been lower than that of BTC and ETH.\u201d\n\n2/ XRP sales are about helping expand XRP's utility \u2013 building RippleNet & supporting other biz building w/XRP ie Dharma & Forte. Reality is we DECREASED our sales by volume Q/Q and since then the inflation rate of XRP circulating supply has been lower than that of BTC and ETH. \u2014 Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) August 27, 2019\n\nConsequently, in response, XRP bag holders did not hold back in venting their frustrations. Many accused Garlinghouse of doublespeak wordplay, while others called Ripple out as a pump and dump.\n\nAs such, Garlinghouse has the opportunity, at DC Fintech Week, to settle apprehensions within the community.\n\nSo @bgarlinghouse how do you explain this: \"Co-founder Jed McCaleb, who is no longer at Ripple, alone sells 500,000 XRP daily, according to Coin Metrics.\" You don't call this dumping and lining pockets?? If not, what do you call it? What is exactly going on? Just curious. \u2014 BloodyBlu (@BloodyBluBlog) August 28, 2019\n\nAt present, XRP is the fifth worst-performing of the top ten, with a -9% loss YTD. And while this pales in comparison to Bitcoin Cash, which has seen a -38% dip this year, the XRP Army are still up in arms over the token\u2019s faltering performance.\n\nThe Bag Holders Are Revolting\n\nTo address this, high profile analyst, Crypto_Bitlord, earlier this month, launched a change.org petition to \u201cStop Ripple Dumping.\u201d At time of press, over 3,500 people have signed the petition, which seeks to rally community support to stop the mass sale of XRP.\n\nThe petition summarizes the primary concern within the XRP community, namely, the continual slide in price despite XRP being touted as the most practical token within the space. It reads:\n\n\u201cEveryday there is good news\u2026 A new bank or partnership announced but still, it manages to keep on dumping. The only logical explanation is that Ripple are dumping on us. And not small amounts either. Literally billions. We have seen the reports of them disclosing this so its a fact.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not all; such is the strength of feeling, Crypto_Bitlord also proposed an XRP fork, to snatch control from Ripple and stop the mass dumpings.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about forking $XRP so we don\u2019t have to deal with the founders dumping. -This will be a community effort. Retweet if you\u2019re in \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \u2014 CRYPTO BITLORD (@Crypto_Bitlord) August 26, 2019\n\nBut in reality, as XRP\u2019s allure is based on Ripple\u2019s efforts to onboard partnerships and promote the benefits of the ecosystem, a community fork is nonsensical.\n\nAll the same, whether Crypto_Bitlord was joking, or not, his call to fork XRP was met with a tide of aggression. And, in what can only be called a demonstration of loyalty to Ripple, threats to his life were made.\n\nSadly taking some time off twitter\u2026 Received numerous death threats over the $XRP fork and I\u2019m continuing to get personal attacks over my past. To those having a good time, thanks for the support and I\u2019ll see you soon \ud83d\ude4f \u2014 CRYPTO BITLORD (@Crypto_Bitlord) August 28, 2019\n\nUndoubtedly, XRP\u2019s price performance raises serious questions of viability, from a retail point of view. Having said that, at the present time, this argument could be extended to include most altcoins. Can Garlinghouse do anything to allay these concerns?\n\nPhoto by Bas Emmen on Unsplash", "description": "Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse is a confirmed keynote speaker at this year's DC Fintech Week.
