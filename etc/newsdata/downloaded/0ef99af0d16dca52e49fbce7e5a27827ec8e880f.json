For someone like me who never had any experience with World of Warcraft, it\u2019s a different sort of time capsule. It\u2019s strange to be a total newbie to one of the biggest games in history, but there\u2019s also joy to be had in not knowing what to do or where to go next.\n\nI know almost nothing about World of Warcraft. I know the Alliance and the Horde, I know that Tempest Keep was merely a setback, I know Jaina\u2019s done some questionable things recently, and I know \u201cyou no take candle.\u201d My knowledge of Warcraft is secondhand. I picked up fragments from things like Hearthstone and that one time I saw the World of Warcraft movie with my girlfriend. WoW Classic is totally alien to me. Ever since my curiosity got the better of me and I started playing two days ago, I\u2019ve bumbled about as a fresh-faced priestess and found myself happily overwhelmed by the game\u2019s scale and design.\n\nMMOs aren\u2019t new to me. I\u2019m an avid Final Fantasy XIV player. I played Star Wars Galaxies, Guild Wars 2, The Old Republic, Lord of the Rings Online, and more. When I dropped into Azeroth, I had some fundamentals to work on: learning the levelling process, how to get new spells, walking the path to the infamous town village of Goldshire. All of it has been a fascinating peek at a world I\u2019ve never known.\n\nThere have been surprises \u2014 I have never in my life seen a Tauren before, so that was a shock \u2014 but they\u2019ve been a lot of fun. And while it feels strange as a games journalist to admit my lack of Warcraft knowledge, I\u2019m content to wander from quest to quest and observe the game\u2019s bustling community.\n\nLast night, I found a green quality bow while slaying a murloc on a quest. Not the highest-quality weapon and also not anything I could use as Priestess. I could have sold it and made a little more money for buying new spells, but instead, I asked in General chat if anyone wanted it. Someone messaged me asking to see the item. I linked it in chat. He passed.\n\n\u201cI hope it goes to a worthy hunter,\u201d the stranger said.\n\nMy reply came quickly: \u201cI figure why sell it if I can help someone out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat the spirit of Classic,\u201d they offered in turn. I\u2019m not making this up; that\u2019s just how nice this stranger was.\n\nI\u2019m level 10 right now, and although I don\u2019t plan to power level, I\u2019ll eventually get to 60 even if I only play one or two nights a week here or there. It\u2019ll be a long, relaxing journey. I\u2019m not going to raid in a hardcore fashion; I won\u2019t have multiple characters; and I\u2019m not gonna role play, even though I found a weary traveller on the road last night and struck up a quick chat. Instead, I\u2019ll amble through Classic and finally get a chance to see what the fuss was about all those years ago.", "description": "World of Warcraft\u00a0Classic is allowing tons of dedicated and longtime fans to relive the early days of their favourite game.
