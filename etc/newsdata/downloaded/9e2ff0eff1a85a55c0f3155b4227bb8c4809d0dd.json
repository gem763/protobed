For those suffering from the typhoon this was for you guys.\n\n'Our heart goes out to all the people suffering from the typhoon.'\n\nA minutes silence was held at the Yokohama Stadium before kick-off to remember the victims of the devastating typhoon.\n\nChants of 'Nippon! Nippon! Nippon!' echoed around the arena throughout the contest as the red-and-white clad majority of the 67,666 crowd got a chance to cheer their own nation at the stadium that hosted the 2002 soccer World Cup final.\n\nThe Blossom's historic victory over Scotland cued jubilant scenes at the Yokohama Stadium\n\nTyphon Hagibis was one of the country's worst ever tropical cyclones and killed 23 people\n\nA brace of tries from Man of the Match Kenki Fukuoka and one each from his fellow winger Kotaro Matsushima - his fifth of the tournament - and prop Keita Inagaki were enough to give Japan a cushion to hold off a Scottish comeback.\n\n'Tonight we went another level,' said coach Jamie Joseph.\n\n'They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\n\n'The Japanese haven't trusted themselves in big moments. Now they know what it takes to get across the line.'\n\nJapan's victory meant they topped Pool A and will now move onto the last eight to face twice world champions South Africa, the team they famously beat at the last World Cup in England in 2015.\n\n'I am incredibly proud,' Leitch added.\n\nA minute's silence was held before kick off to remember the victims of devastating typhoon\n\nJapan now face a quarter-final against South Africa, who they famously beat four years ago\n\n'We played with our heart. It wasn't about skill today but was about emotion today.\n\n'We are representing Asia, Japan and tier two. We will give everything in the next games.'\n\nScotland coach Gregor Townsend was gracious in defeat. 'Japan deserved it today,' he said.\n\n'They played really well in that first 50-60 and they are a very good team.'", "description": "Japan captain Michael Leitch dedicated the team's 28-21 victory over Scotland at the Rugby World Cup on Sunday to those affected by the typhoon which nearly cancelled the match.", "authors": ["Nick Mulvenney For Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/15/19655876-0-image-a-30_1570975543405.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
