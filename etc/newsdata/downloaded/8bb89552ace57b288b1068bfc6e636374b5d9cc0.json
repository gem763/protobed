Social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook...) need to work better as well with football clubs, because every day you see at least a racist comment under a post of a person of colour. We\u2019ve been saying it for years and still no action.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, it\u2019s 2019, instead of going forward we\u2019re going backwards and I think as players we need (to) unify and make a statement on this matter to keep this game clean and enjoyable for everyone.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Chelsea\u2019s Kurt Zouma became the latest British-based player to receive abuse on social media platforms following a late own goal against Sheffield United.\n\nThis followed similar treatment for his team-mate Tammy Abraham and Manchester United duo Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford \u2013 all after they failed to score penalties \u2013 and several other black players in the Premier League and Championship.\n\nKick It Out, the anti-racism and discrimination organisation, released a statement on Monday condemning the abuse.\n\n\u201cThis weekend has resulted in yet another player facing disgusting racist and discriminatory abuse on social media simply for doing their job and this behaviour has to stop,\u201d it read.", "description": "Inter Milan striker Romelu Lukaku is calling on footballers to take a united stance against racist abuse, saying the situation is getting worse, not better, after he was targeted by Cagliari fans on Sunday.
