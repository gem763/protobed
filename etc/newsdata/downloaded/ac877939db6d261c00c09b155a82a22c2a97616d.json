Raheem f***ing Sterling!' It was followed by: 'Raheem Sterling, he's one of our own.'\n\nIt was a rare uplifting moment on an ugly night in Bulgaria.\n\nEngland fans cheered on their side despite the game being overshadowed by racist abuse\n\nRaheem Sterling (left) and Co eased Bulgaria aside but faced abuse from the home supporters\n\nSome Bulgaria fans were seen wearing black hoodies and others attended wearing balaclavas\n\nRarely has a travelling England support been so united. The England fan abroad is often maligned - sometimes fairly, sometimes not - but when their team or one of their players experiences hostility or abuse, the backing is absolutely unequivocal.\n\nIt was an evening in which everyone connected with the Three Lions in Sofia - on the pitch, in the dug-outs and in the away section - emerged with credit for facing down the vile racist abuse dealt out by a group of Bulgarian thugs.\n\nThis was, unfortunately, always on the cards. Talk of the potential for such abuse dominated the build-up to this fixture, overshadowing even the miserable performance we witnessed against the Czech Republic in Prague on Friday night.\n\nEngland players spoke to boss Gareth Southgate after the match was halted due to the abuse\n\nBulgaria supporters could be seen making offensive gestures and also made monkey chants\n\nIt even attracted more attention than the prospect of boorish, anti-social behaviour from the huge contingents of England fans that travelled to two destinations - Prague and Sofia - that are easily accessible on budget airlines and where beers are \u00a31 each.\n\nThe Friday night match in Prague passed off without incident and so did Monday in Sofia. Groups of England fans had gathered in the bars and cafes of the Vitosha Boulevard from lunchtime, drinking beers in the glorious October sunshine.\n\nThere was more a sense of curiosity from the locals towards the visitors than any hostility, with everything kept in check by groups of police officers in riot gear stationed nearby.\n\nA good few England fans took the opportunity to explore a city that doesn\u2019t really appear on anyone\u2019s list of dream holiday destinations.\n\nOnly when the ludicrously late kick-off of 9.45pm local time approached did things became a little more chaotic. Fuelled by a full afternoon's drinking, groups of England fans sang and chanted as they made the 20-minute walk from Vitosha to the stadium.\n\nBut there wasn't any trouble or bad behaviour, just the usual songs about Gareth Southgate being 'the one', Harry Maguire's massive forehead and the new song about 'Scotland getting battered everywhere they go' to the tune of Rotterdam (Or Anywhere) by the Beautiful South.\n\nThe build-up to the game passed without incident as England fans enjoyed the sun in Sofia\n\nBulgaria had a police presence to monitor away fans across the city ahead of the qualifier\n\nThere were only problems when we reached the dimly-lit park surrounding the Vasil Levski. A complete lack of signs or crowd control meant groups of England fans walked up to various home entrances before being corralled in the right direction by riot police.\n\nBut the reality is the Vasil Levski, a huge concrete relic from the country's Communist era, would have long since been condemned in a western European country.\n\nThe terraces were crumbling, the concourses dark and claustrophobic, and the England fans in one corner of the ground separated from home stands by spiked metal fencing. With the running track surrounding the pitch, the view was pretty terrible.\n\nTo our left were the 5,000 seats left empty as ordered by UEFA as punishment for racist chanting and the showcasing of far-right symbols at previous international games. But the bank in the opposite corner was also completely deserted, this due to apathy with a hopeless team currently sitting bottom of the qualifying group.\n\nThose who got closer to home areas reported plenty of ominous signs of what was about to unfold. Swastikas daubed on seats and walls, a fan shop covered in stickers that read 'against tolerance' and 'respect racism'.\n\nMobs of home fans dressed in balaclava and black hoodies that read 'UEFA Mafia: No respect' and 'Hooligans from Sofia' had gathered in a home section at the far end of the main stand.\n\nThe thing about an England section at away matches is that it's unfailingly loud and boisterous. Chants sprout up from different groups and bounce around. The noise is pretty constant.\n\nFlags from clubs across England covered the away section as fans were loud during the game\n\nMarcus Rashford (right) produced a stunning opening goal to set England on their way\n\nThat's why the first indication anything was awry came only when play stopped on 27 minutes, with England leading 2-0.\n\nFrom the away end, it was impossible to hear the monkey chants that led to Tyrone Mings speaking to the assistant referee, let alone see anyone making a Nazi salute.\n\nThe same thing happened in Montenegro back in March. The noise in the away end was so loud, I wasn't aware of the racist noises there until reading reports after the match.\n\nUEFA'S THREE-STEP PROTOCOL TO DEAL WITH RACISM 1 - The referee will speak to the stadium announcer and demand the halting of racist behaviour. 2 - If it continues, the referee can take the players off the field into the dressing rooms for a period of time and the stadium announcer will make another address. 3 - If it still continues, the match will be abandoned.\n\nWhen play halted, the natural assumption therefore was that a player was injured and needed treatment. However, when Southgate was spotted speaking to the referee as the England players gathered near the dug-out, it soon became apparent our fears about this fixture had been realised.\n\nWith the wonders of smartphones, it wasn't long before England fans were able to find out what was unfolding. Twitter was soon abuzz with screenshots from ITV coverage of black-clad thugs making Nazi salutes and reports from those closer to the home fans.\n\nThe apparent PA announcement - step one of UEFA's protocol for racist incidents - was drowned out. To be honest I'm not even convinced there was a PA system in the away end anyway, or it was broken.\n\nWhen the match was again stopped in the 43rd minute, it looked for a moment as if the England players were about to walk off. There was then sudden movement in the far corner as stewards cleared out the offensive fans, who left the stadium and didn't return, leaving yet more empty seats.\n\nAt half-time, England fans were able to gain a fuller picture of events and their natural instinct was to rally round the players - especially Sterling, Mings and Marcus Rashford.\n\nMuch of the second-half saw chanting related to the events, beginning with 'You racist b******s, you know what you are' accompanied by a sea of fingers pointing at the home fans.\n\nBut as abuse continued and became audible, Southgate addressed his players on the issue\n\nThey opted to carry on playing and Raheem Sterling showed his class with the fifth goal\n\nThere were various chants in support of Sterling and thunderous applause when he was taken off on 73 minutes, likewise for Rashford three minutes later. There was a show of mutual appreciation between players and fans after the final whistle, even if the fact England had won 6-0 was, by this stage, largely forgotten.\n\nI'd like to think England's players appreciate the sacrifices loyal fans make to watch a match on the other side of Europe on a Monday night.\n\nFew, if any, other country could command a travelling support of over 3,000 to such a fixture and, though England fans in general are often let down by a misbehaving minority, the love of the national team is never in question.\n\nThat especially comes to the fore in extremis, as here. We were held inside the stadium by police for 20 minutes after the final whistle and it was clear the authorities weren't taking any chances.\n\nThere were riot police lining the routes back into town and blue flashing lights everywhere you turned. My coach back to the airport was given a full police escort, although this isn't unique to Bulgaria.\n\nFortunately there were no reports of the local hooligans showing their faces later in the evening, with most England fans happy to retire to their beds having been let out the ground well after midnight.\n\nSo what happens now? The most sickening thing is the state of denial of the Bulgarian coach Krasimir Balakov, who claimed he wasn't aware of any racist chanting despite the fact some of his players pleaded with their own fans to desist as they walked off at half-time.\n\nThis followed the remarks of various Bulgarian FA chiefs before the game that England should get their own house in order before criticising other nations. There's certainly something in this. There have been several incidents of racism in English football in recent years, so it really is difficult to take the moral high ground.\n\nAll eyes will now be on UEFA to see what action is taken. Hopefully it will dawn on them that empty seats, slap on the wrist fines and an Equal Game hashtag are pretty damn ineffective deterrents.\n\nPerhaps they should start banning countries from entire qualifying tournaments, denying them the chance to join the party at a World Cup or European Championship.\n\nEngland fans were defiant on an ugly night in Sofia and represented the Three Lions well\n\nSouthgate led by example and came over to applaud the travelling supporters at full-time\n\nEVENTS OF ENGLAND'S 6-0 WIN OVER BULGARIA The game was halted TWICE as home fans abuse black players, brandish 'No Respect' shirts and make Nazi salutes in planned racist onslaught\n\nTyrone Mings reveals vile chants started before kick-off in Bulgaria\n\nMarcus Rashford praises 'courage' of Bulgaria captain Ivelin Popov for appealing to fans at half-time to stop racist taunting of England players\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate considered taking his players off the pitch against Bulgaria as FA chairman Greg Clarke condemns racist taunting\n\nBulgaria boss Krasimir Balakov claimed not to have heard any chanting and said in his post-match press conference: 'The unacceptable behaviour was by England fans.'\n\nIan Wright says England players taking action against racism made him 'feel really good'\n\nRaheem Sterling calls out Bulgaria coach Krasimir Balakov for saying England have a bigger racism problem than his own country and posts funny Ainsley Harriott meme in response to Piers Morgan hailing his performance in face of vile racist abuse\n\nUEFA will use evidence from specialist 'spotters' in the crowd and TV footage to prosecute after Bulgarian fans' appalling racist taunts\n\nBulgaria's prime minister has called on the president of their FA to quit over the racist incidents\n\nBut that punishes entire populations for the actions of a despicable minority and it's unlikely those chanting and making straight arm salutes will even care, not being true football fans.\n\nIt has been argued that England should have simply walked off the pitch on Monday night and while this may have made a statement, it also reinforces whatever notions of racial supremacy these morons have.\n\nIn the end, all associated with England got it as right as they could have done. Southgate - who is a better statesman and diplomat than most of our politicians - described it as an 'impossible situation' and it's hard to disagree.\n\nWe can only hope it's the last time we see an England fixture overshadowed in such a depressing way.", "description": "ADAM SHERGOLD IN SOFIA: It was an evening in which everyone connected with England in Sofia - on the pitch, in the dug-outs and in the away section - emerged with credit in the face of abuse.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/13/19740550-0-image-a-19_1571143913690.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
