There are so many different numbers on there which simply don't add up.\n\n'They are not mathematics, but more likely some weird occult materials. The numbers are all over the place written in black ink.\n\n'They go from top to bottom, side-to-side and run across each other without making sense.\n\n'One possibility is that they are orders for the family members to walk around in circles. But there is also likely some other twisted truth behind them.'\n\nOther items taken away for examining, including tens of thousands of Euros, are a set of books and records kept by the two men.\n\nPolice have brought in thermal imaging cameras to search under the soil of the fields around the farmhouse and sniffer dogs to examine underneath floor boards.\n\nThe cameras have the technology to search for human remains, but there is no suggestion that the police probe is set to become a murder or missing persons inquiry.\n\nPolice are delving into the backgrounds of Brunner, 58, and 67-year-old van Dorsten who used to live in adjoining homes at Hasslet, around five miles from the farm house.\n\nThey kept five sheep and had a circular portable pond where a duck swam around in circles, the source said.\n\nAn exterior view of the local pub De Kastelein in the village of Ruinerwold where Jan Zon befriended the owner\n\nVegetables were grown in the fields and Brunner would do a weekly shop at a local Lidi store.\n\nBrunner lived a few miles away in a trailer at the back of his carpenter workshop.\n\nThe two arrested men had close business ties with Brunner paying the rent on van Dorsten's toy craft store in Mepple and another storage unit nearby.\n\nOne of van Dorsten's sons Endino lived above the unit with his wife and two children.\n\nTwo of his siblings, sister Marjan, 29, and brother Shin have joined him in expressing their 'dismay' at the fortunes of their five siblings, aged 18-25, inside the farmhouse and have promised to support them.\n\nIn a statement they said their father had broken off contact with much of his family back in the eighties and had 'asked us not to make any attempt to find his place of residence.'\n\nThey lived with an uncle and grandparents and the family have reached out to the free five offering them support.\n\nThe rescued youngsters are said to be barely able to speak and walking around in circles as they are kept in care and provided with counselling and medical support.\n\nBrunner tempted fate when he let Jan Zon van Dorsten out into the public to help his business.\n\nDuring the summer he was busy on social media and also contacted a graphic design company in May on Brunner's orders.\n\nHe got in touch by a WhatsApp message and then by email and said he preferred the internet to conduct business and told the company: 'It is because I am deaf.'\n\nBut a source at the graphic design company, which asked not to be identified, said the business was 'well communicated and always friendly' by him.\n\nJan, 25, required a logo to be created for the business Creconat and paid for the work by bank transfer.\n\nThe 25-year-old , whose escape led to police arresting his father, Brunner and freeing his five siblings, also commissioned the designers to create a corporate identity and website.\n\nThe work was in progress when police took him into care and swooped on the farm house.\n\nOn June 6 he wrote in Facebook: 'Begun a new job at Creconat.'\n\nCreconat was a wing of the woodworking company Native Creative Economy in Meppel which was owned by Brunner.\n\nThe logo commissioned by Jan Zon on behalf of Brunner showed an isolated country house, with trees, a horse in front and a cockerel on the roof. The designer said Brunner's company said it wanted to 'create a better world.'", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Police have found a large white board at Gerrit Jan van Dorsten's farmhouse in Ruinerwold with numbers and drawings which have 'mystified' investigators.", "authors": ["Shekhar Bhatia For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929308-0-image-a-80_1571499322026.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
