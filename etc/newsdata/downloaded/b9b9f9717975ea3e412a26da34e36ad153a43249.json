But these achievements are still too often reliant on an individual student being able to navigate the barriers in their way.\n\n\u201cIt is time for universities to ensure genuinely equal opportunities for disabled students. This means not only meeting their legal duties to individual students, but learning from each other to create learning environments in which all students can thrive.\"\n\nThe warning comes after The Independent revealed that a shortage of support in universities is driving deaf students to consider abandoning their degrees.\n\nWaits of up to a year for assistance such as interpreters, specialist tutors and note-taking in lectures are leaving undergraduates feeling ostracised, according to the National Deaf Children\u2019s Society (NDCS).\n\nMartin McLean, policy advisor at the NDCS, said: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling to see higher university drop-out rates for disabled students, particularly when so many have spent their lives overcoming countless barriers put in front of them just to secure a place.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This cannot be allowed to continue and universities and the government both need to stop resting on their laurels, investigate why this is happening and ensure that deaf students are given the same chance to succeed as everyone else.\u201d\n\nPiers Wilkinson, disabled students\u2019 officer at the National Union of Students, said: \u201cThe current provision isn\u2019t just inadequate, it is intentionally not given. When it comes to disabled students, we are always measured up against a price tag, and once we become more expensive than profitable, we are forced to go into debt or seek charity to access our basic right to education.\u201d\n\nUniversities minister Chris Skidmore said: \u201cWe know that higher education has the power to transform lives and it\u2019s fantastic to see the difference it can make to those with disabilities. However, we know that gaps still remain in attainment and career opportunities, and we need to level the playing field.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI want to see universities stepping up to the challenge to improve support for students from all backgrounds, including disabled students, so everyone can flourish in higher education and have the best possible chance of a successful career.\u201d\n\nA Universities UK spokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased to see that going to university significantly improves employment rates for disabled people. Universities want all students to reach their full potential and encourage open conversations about disability and disclosure. Universities UK is supporting the new Disabled Students\u2019 Commission which will advise on how universities can further improve support for disabled students.\u201d", "description": "Students with disabilities are dropping out because of a lack of support, charities and unions warn, as the regulator has called on universities to do more to tackle the \u201cconcerning\u201d trend.\u00a0 Institutions are relying on individuals\u00a0to disclose their disability and request adjustments, rather than providing all the provision they need, the Office for Students (OfS) has warned in", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/19/16/graduates-inequality.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
