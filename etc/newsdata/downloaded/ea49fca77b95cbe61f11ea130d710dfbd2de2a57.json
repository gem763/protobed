(AP) - Minshew Mania stretches coast to coast , from Jacksonville to Pullman, Washington. Gardner Minshew could gain an international following this week, too.\n\nThe rookie quarterback will make his London debut when the Jacksonville Jaguars (4-4) face AFC rival Houston (5-3) at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be pretty good,\u201d Minshew said Wednesday when asked about his anticipated reception. \u201cI hear they are pretty big Jags fans over there. If they\u2019re Jags fans, then they\u2019re my fans, too.\u201d\n\nIt could be Minshew\u2019s final start this season. Nick Foles (broken collarbone) is eligible to come off injured reserve in time for Jacksonville\u2019s next game, at Indianapolis on Nov. 17, and has a chance to regain his starting role.\n\n\u201cThis is too big of a game to really think about anything else,\u201d Minshew said. \u201cWe\u2019re sitting at a pivotal point, playing a divisional opponent and this will be the last time we get to play them, so it\u2019s definitely a big one.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s significant for Jacksonville\u2019s season and equally important to the small-market franchise\u2019s financial stability .\n\nThe Jaguars credit about 11% of their local revenue to playing annually abroad.\n\nJacksonville\u2019s ticket, television, sponsorship and stadium revenue streams are smaller than NFL teams in larger markets. Earning money in London helps offset some of the disparity, and the game remains a critical part of the team\u2019s long-term plan.\n\nThe Jaguars have played a \u201chome game\u201d at Wembley Stadium every year since 2013 and are under contract to do so through 2020. Jaguars owner Shad Khan and team president Mark Lamping expect the contract to be extended, but they also see the growing desire for other teams to play overseas.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely committed to it,\u201d Khan said earlier this year. \u201cAll the stats, everything we have, what it has done with playing in London is stabilizing the Jaguars here in Jacksonville.\u201d\n\nKhan tried to strengthen Jacksonville\u2019s foothold in London by bidding $790 million (\u00a3600 million) to buy historic Wembley in 2018. He withdrew his offer for the English Football Association\u2019s main asset last October after recognizing the extent of opposition to the sale.\n\nKhan and the Jaguars insist the move was never intended to create a potential relocation spot for the NFL team but rather a way to gain more control over American football in the burgeoning overseas market. It also would have funneled more money back to Jacksonville.\n\nKhan remains open to buying Wembley if it were to end up back on the market.\n\nIn the meantime, the Jaguars believe playing in London every year provides them an advantage over everyone else in the league. Nearly 60% of the team\u2019s 53-man roster has played at least one NFL game in London.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is knowing what to expect,\u201d veteran defensive end Lerentee McCray said. \u201cWe go over there knowing what to expect. The coaches and management, they know how to get us prepared. And as a player, having the experience, we know a little bit, too. We know what works for us.\u201d\n\nMinshew has no idea how to handle the seven-hour flight and ensuing jet lag.\n\nHis path to the pros took him from Troy to Northwest Mississippi Community College to East Carolina and finally to Washington State, where he led the nation in passing in 2018.\n\nBut he\u2019s never been out of the country.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asking people like what\u2019s good to see,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the London Eye. That\u2019s the big Ferris wheel, right? Is it just that big? It\u2019s a pretty big deal? So maybe that, I guess. Go see the town from that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Minshew Mania stretches coast to coast , from Jacksonville to Pullman, Washington.
