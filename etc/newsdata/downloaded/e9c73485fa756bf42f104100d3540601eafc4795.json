But the regret comes with a caveat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely my bad,\u201d Sherman told McAfee. \u201cI never want anybody to deal with some sh-t that \u2014 I mean some some stuff \u2014 that they didn\u2019t do. And so, you know, the questions that he\u2019s gonna get and the annoying, nonsense questions about some stuff that happened in a game that\u2019s already been done, you know, sure he\u2019ll get an apology for that. I\u2019ll probably reach out to him via text or social media to actually get ahold of him and talk to him in person, I mean on the phone. But, yeah, because that sucks. . . . But yeah, yeah. He definitely deserves an apology, and my bad on that.\u201d\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMcAfee asked Sherman whether he would have worded things differently if he had a chance to redo the discussion with Mike Silver of NFL Media.\n\n\u201cI may have phrased it differently, but I meant what I said,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cI did feel the disrespect. . . . I felt disrepect and at the end of the day that\u2019s all the story was, really. Like, people can say, \u2018Oh my God, he shook your hand\u2019 or \u2018Oh my God you were wrong.\u2019 You can say whatever you want. I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\nBut the truth continues to be that Sherman claimed Mayfield refused to shake Sherman\u2019s hand, that Sherman doubled and tripled down on that contention after the initial videos that didn\u2019t prove him wrong first emerged, and that Sherman only admitted that the handshake happened (and began deleting tweets to the contrary) once it was clear that the handshake did indeed occur.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd as it relates to actual or perceived disrespect, it\u2019s just as easy to say that Sherman disrespected Mayfield. As Simms pointed out on PFT Live, Sherman didn\u2019t seem to be all that enthused about interacting with Mayfield, either.\n\nRegardless, Sherman apologized, as he should have. Whether NFL Media apologizes for posting those false claims without properly vetting them or seeking comment from Mayfield or the Browns and then failing to revise the story for roughly three hours after the truth emerged remains to be seen.\n\nIt also remains to be seen how Mayfield addresses the issue with reporters. He\u2019s due to meet with reporters today.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Sherman\u2019s next media availability. He won\u2019t want to be grilled on the subject, and if he gets asked a bunch of \u201cannoying, nonsense questions\u201d on a topic that he surely won\u2019t want to discuss, he could get angry.\n\nMaybe angry enough to threaten to ruin a reporter\u2019s career.", "description": "The next move in HandshakeGate has happened. 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman, appearing Wednesday on The Pat McAfee Show, has expressed regret for the erroneous claim that Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield snubbed Sherman prior to the coin toss on Monday night.
