After all, if one trend is good (cold coffee is hot!), why not layer on another (millennials love alcoholic drinks that don\u2019t taste like booze) \u2014 and then another (they also are crazy for canned beverages!) for good measure?\n\nA turducken of fads is one way of seeing the mini-boomlet of iced coffee laced with varying degrees of malt or wine-based liquor and served in the slender aluminum tubes that have come to dominate the beverage aisles \u2014 a trend for which you can thank/blame the hard seltzer phenom White Claw.\n\n[The key to White Claw\u2019s surging popularity: Marketing to a post-gender world]\n\nBeer giant Pabst Blue Ribbon was one of the first big entrants, introducing its hard coffee this summer. Then the third-wave coffee maker La Colombe partnered up with MillerCoors for its high-end, cold-brewed version. Both are available in limited markets as the companies test demand. Smaller labels, too, have gotten into the mix.\n\nAnother explanation for it is purely functional. Booze might be fun, but it can make you sleepy, too, so pairing it with caffeine keeps the good times going. As one colleague described the downers/uppers mix: \u201cIt\u2019s the Judy Garland of drinks.\u201d\n\nThe marriage of alcohol and caffeine isn\u2019t new, of course. Irish coffee crossed the pond a decade before aging rocker Bono was even born. The espresso martini followed in the 1980s (its perhaps apocryphal origin story is that legendary London bartender Dick Bradsell created it when a supermodel \u2014 some tales say Naomi Campbell, others Kate Moss \u2014 ordered something \u201cto wake me up, then [expletive] me up.\u201d)\n\nIn more recent history, the combo brings to mind the vodka-Red Bull craze of the early aughts and Four Loko, whose early formulation was dubbed \u201cblackout in a can\u201d and eventually banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010.\n\nSo, back to those drinks on the table. We assembled four varieties of boozy cold coffees and gave them a whirl \u2014 and a few sips. As a class, our tasters found them to be super-sweet and overly creamy, with one exception. But the overriding response was simply \u2026 confusion.\n\nWhen, exactly, were we supposed to knock back these drinks? The sugar and dairy bombs are hardly light, session-able tipples. And they don\u2019t pair very well with food, except maybe brunch, as one taster suggested. Or dessert? Maybe in place of dessert, we wondered? We imagined combining them with ice cream in shakes and affogato-style concoctions \u2014 but wait, wasn\u2019t the can format supposed to make them take-anywhere convenient?\n\nHere\u2019s what we tasted:\n\nCafe Agave Spiked Cold Brew\n\nThe offerings from this start-up business from San Diego\u2019s La Jolla neighborhood distinguish themselves by being the booziest of the bunch. They clock in at 12.5 percent alcohol by volume, more than twice that of the others we tasted, with a base of wine instead of malt. The company has four flavors: espresso, mocha, vanilla-cinnamon and salted caramel.\n\nWe detected the alcohol-forward profile of all of them \u2014 as well as a cloying sweetness we attributed to the namesake agave syrup \u2014 but we were divided on whether this was a good or bad thing. One taster panned the \u201cunpleasant alcohol burn,\u201d while another liked that \u201cat least it\u2019s not pretending it\u2019s not booze.\u201d The salted caramel and vanilla-cinnamon varieties were across-the-board losers, while the mocha and espresso cans fared better.\n\nLa Colombe Hard Cold Brew\n\nThe pairing of a legit coffee brand with a beer behemoth made us optimistic about this one. And the can\u2019s sleek gold-on-navy design was another classy clue. Once poured, the line (it comes in black and vanilla-flavored, both 4.2% ABV) also distinguished itself by being the only we tasted to omit dairy, meaning the concoctions were lighter-bodied and less dessert-like.\n\nThe black variety was preferred, with our tasters agreeing that it tasted like a regular chilled coffee or espresso \u2014 a decent bean even, with one sipper detecting a pleasant \u201cberry bitterness.\u201d We preferred the minimal sweetness of the black over the vanilla, which one likened to \u201cthe watery end of some vanilla Frappuccino that you sip through a straw before tossing the cup in the trash.\u201d\n\nNewground Hard Dutch Latte\n\nThis Dutch import comes in two latte varieties: chai and regular cafe. The pale, weakly spiced chai got low marks, but several tasters thought the cafe latte, with its heavy-bodied creaminess, could swap in for an after-dinner drink, though at 5% ABV it\u2019s lower-octane than most nightcaps. \u201cReminds me of Baileys Irish Cream,\u201d one said.\n\nPabst Blue Ribbon Hard Coffee\n\nOur tasters identified something awfully familiar about the flavor of this one, but there was no consensus on just what it was. \u201cNestl\u00e9 Quik,\u201d one suggested. Other sweets that it conjured included \u201ca liquefied malted-milk ball,\u201d a \u201cmilkshake\u201d and a \u201cmelted Snickers.\u201d So dessert, then \u2014 with a 5% ABV kick, that is.\n\nPerhaps it was the nostalgic associations that made at least one of us cop to a guilty-pleasure attraction to the can: \u201cWhy am I ashamed to say I like it?\u201d\n\nMore from Voraciously:\n\nImpossible vs. Beyond: We tested cook-at-home versions to see who makes a better vegan burger\n\nThis high-tech vegan ice cream may be good enough to fool even die-hard dairy lovers\n\nKFC\u2019s new fried chicken and doughnut sandwich is terrifying and delicious", "description": "After tasting some of the biggest brands, we were left with a question: When are we supposed to drink this stuff?", "authors": ["Emily Heil", "Food Reporter", "October At Am", "Emily Heil Is A Reporter Covering National Food News", "Trends.
