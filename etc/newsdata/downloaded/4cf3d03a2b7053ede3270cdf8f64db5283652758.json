His side will now face South Africa but only after squeezing into the last four against 14-man opponents courtesy of a 74th-minute try from the replacement back-row Ross Moriarty.\n\nWales come from behind to beat 14-man France in World Cup quarter-final Read more\n\nHad Wales lost it would have marked the end of Gatland\u2019s 124-Test tenure as their coach and, helped by the match-turning 49th-minute red card shown to S\u00e9bastien Vahaamahina, he conceded his side had been fortunate to survive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take your hat off to France. They were excellent and very unlucky. I definitely went through a lot of emotions today. We didn\u2019t play our best tonight but we showed some great character and we\u2019re looking forward to the semi-final. We\u2019re 160 minutes away from possibly winning the World Cup. If you can\u2019t get excited about that nothing will excite you.\n\n\u201cThe red card was very significant but that sometimes galvanises teams. I don\u2019t think anyone could complain about it. The right decision was made. It was heat of the moment stuff, he just made an error of judgment.\u201d The Six Nations champions have now won eight of their past nine Tests against France.\n\nPlay Video 0:35 Rugby World Cup: Wales edge France and South Africa beat Japan \u2013 video highlights\n\nThe France coach, Jacques Brunel, said the outcome \u201cwas difficult to accept\u201d and described the way it happened as \u201ccruel\u201d. He did not dispute that Vahaamahina deserved to be sent off \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s very clear\u201d \u2013 but said there were \u201cother decisions I don\u2019t totally agree with\u201d. He was particularly referring to Moriarty\u2019s late try: \u201cI think the ball went forwards,\u201d Brunel said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the decision again.\u201d\n\nWales sigh collective relief as Moriarty gives Warren Gatland a shot at glory | Gerard Meagher Read more\n\nThe Wales wing Josh Adams felt differently. \u201cWe got a scrum on their line and then it was a moment of magic from Tomos Williams to rip the ball off their player. When it went to the TMO it was a case of \u2018what is he looking at now?\u2019 because we were jogging back to the halfway line. He checked and thankfully it was all good and we got that vital try.\u201d\n\nWales\u2019s opening try-scorer Aaron Wainwight, the player on the receiving end of Vahaamahina\u2019s elbow, also felt the sending-off was justified. \u201cWe were in the maul and he had me by the neck to start off with,\u201d the flanker said. \u201cI was trying to get the ref\u2019s attention and then the elbow came in. It wasn\u2019t very nice at the time. I was a bit surprised the ref didn\u2019t see it but thankfully the ref pulled it up and it was dealt with. Fair play to the boys they put the pressure on afterwards and saw the game through.\n\n\u201cIt was a brutal game, very tight so we\u2019re pleased to come away with the win. It wasn\u2019t the best performance, so it\u2019s exciting to see what we will be able to achieve when we do perform at our best. There are no celebrations yet \u2013 we haven\u2019t got the job done yet. The celebrations will come after we come away with the trophy.\u201d", "description": "Warren Gatland said that France \u2018were excellent and very unlucky\u2019 in their 20-19 defeat to Wales, who face South Africa in the World Cup semi-final", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae9a85c2f3da1dfd60a95f97bec0811c4aeab6d/0_47_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=af67298cde2c367285296205bb68af42", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
