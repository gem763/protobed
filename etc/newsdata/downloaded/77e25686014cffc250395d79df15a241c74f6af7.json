More than 50 organizations have come together to stop the cuts to and eliminations of local health care services by the Doug Ford government. The groups include students, seniors, community agencies, faith and social justice organizations, health professional organizations, unions, nurses, doctors, patients and representatives of City Council.\n\n\n\nThe Doug Ford government is planning to:\n\nCut Public Health funding & eliminate 25 out of 35 local Public Health Units, reducing them to 10.\n\nEliminate 49 out of 59 local ambulance services, reducing them to 10 & eliminate 12 of 22 local dispatch centres.\n\nMake real-dollar cuts to public hospital funding, even though we have the fewest hospital beds left per person of any province in Canada and a crisis of hospital overcrowding. More cuts mean more services & staff cuts, less services, longer waits, more privatization & higher death rates.\n\nMake real-dollar cuts to long-term care homes, forcing municipalities to either raise taxes or cut services for elderly & chronic care residents.\n\nNatalie Mehra, Executive Director of the Ontario Health Coalition pointed out that, \u201cThe Ford government has appointed a facilitator to try to modify the cuts, but still move them through. This is not good enough. The Ford government has no mandate to cut Public Health, ambulance services, hospitals and long-term care.\u201d She went on to affirm that, \u201cThere is no evidence to support the elimination and cuts to these vital local services.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, City of Toronto Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam noted that, \u201cThe City of Toronto will be disproportionately impacted by the Public Health cuts.\u201d She went on to say, \u201cAs far as we are aware, we are going to be seeing about a billion dollars of funding cuts over the next five years. This is going to have tremendous impact on the residents of Toronto. It is not going to be good.\u201d She called on residents to join the rally in the thousands or tens of thousands, in order to save the services.\n\nCathryn Hoy, First Vice-President of the Ontario Nurses Association described the vital work done by Public Health nurses, which includes health promotion programs and infectious disease prevention. She noted that Ontario hospitals are already suffering from underfunding and overcrowding and said, \u201cDoug Ford promised to end hallway medicine, but these cuts will mean that more people will end up in hospital emergency departments and will do nothing to improve hospital overcrowding. In fact, they will make matters worse\u201d\n\nEster Dubali a student at UofT who leads the UofT Health Coalition and the Legal Literacy Club emphasized that, \u201cStudents are already being impacted by OSAP cuts at school and now by these dramatic service cuts outside of school. We know how important these services are. Students are mobilizing to join the rally to send a strong message to Doug Ford.\u201d\n\nDave Mitchell, President of CUPE Local 79, representing more than 20,000 municipal employees impacted by the cuts, including Public Health workers and long-term care workers asserted that, \u201cThese cuts that Premier Ford has announced and is pushing forward are unreasonable. They are unfair and they do not help residents of Ontario and the residents of Toronto. They are cutting services that protect and save people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe Ontario Health Coalition, which is sponsoring the rally, asked for Torontonians to come out to the rally, and to volunteer and donate if they can, to help make it a success.
