How he can do it because the ball is far away?\n\n\u201cThe player is in a full sprint to bring him down without the ball around, for me there is only one card. It is dangerous as hell.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause the boy any problems. He's a super player but these kind of challenges\u2026 no. \u201cFrom a football point of view, if you are quick, you need to make sure. I only need two eyes to see it can cause injury.\u201d", "description": "Footage has shed new light on the full-time bust-up between Ayoze Perez and Andy Robertson at Anfield", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Twitter", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20509545.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-06-at-103152.png", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
