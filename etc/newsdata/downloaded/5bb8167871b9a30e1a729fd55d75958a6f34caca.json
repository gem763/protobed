He later told Reuters: \"We feel they are a proxy for Juul, there's a very real possibility\".\n\nA Juul spokesman declined to comment on the government's remarks, while Plume Vapour did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWoke Vapors said in a statement it will continue to work towards an outcome whereby e-cigarettes are regulated, not prohibited.\n\nTwo senior Juul executives were in the courtroom, seated for most of the two-hour hearing next to the federal health ministry's bureaucrat who oversees tobacco control, Vikas Sheel.\n\nJuul Labs, in which tobacco company Altria Group Inc owns a 35% stake, is facing increased scrutiny in the United States, its home market, as teen use of e-cigarettes surges.\n\nEven before the ban was announced, the Indian government had said products such as Juul were harmful and could potentially undermine its tobacco control efforts. More than 900,000 people die each year in India because of tobacco-related illnesses.\n\nHowever, India has 106 million adult smokers, second only to China, making it a lucrative potential market for companies selling both tobacco and vaping products.\n\nPlume Vapour counsel told the court that \"relative harm\" from e-cigarettes was less than from tobacco products and the government was scaring consumers by banning the product.\n\nThe government's counsel Lekhi said e-cigarette's novelty and attractiveness pose a public health danger, and the product needs to be nipped in the bud.\n\n\"You don't want a new substance to cause addiction,\" he told the court.\n\nThe court on Tuesday did not put the ban order on hold, but as a temporary relief revoked the current requirement for sellers to submit their existing stock of e-cigarettes to authorities for disposal.\n\nThe cases, a legal test of the government's ban order, will next be heard on Nov. 14.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra and Subrata Nagchoudhury in Kolkata; Editing by Susan Fenton and Grant McCool)", "description": "KOLKATA, India (Reuters) - The impending introduction of Juul e-cigarettes in India was a factor in the government's decision to ban the sale of vaping products, a top government lawyer said in court on Tuesday while defending the order.", "authors": ["Aditya Kalra"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
