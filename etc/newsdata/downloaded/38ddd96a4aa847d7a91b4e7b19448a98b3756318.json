He needs to come before Congress and explain himself,\u201d Warner said.\n\nThe Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u2013 Roots of the Russia investigation \u2013\n\nThe criminal inquiry has grown out of an initial internal DoJ probe led by federal prosecutor John Durham into the beginnings of the 2016 investigation into whether members of Trump\u2019s campaign conspired with Moscow\u2019s sweeping effort to influence the election.\n\nEarlier this year Mueller concluded the investigation with a report showing dozens of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians, and demonstrating that the campaign actively sought dirt on Clinton from Moscow.\n\nMueller ruled that those activities did not rise to the level of a criminal conspiracy.\n\nMarcy Wheeler, an independent journalist who has studied deeply the Russia investigation, said Durham could be honing in on procedural errors or leaks in the early days of the Russia probe.\n\nThose could involve former campaign aide George Papadopoulos and former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn, both of whom pleaded guilty in the Mueller investigation to lying to investigators.\n\nBoth are also now seeking to reverse their convictions, alleging malfeasance by the Obama DoJ and FBI.\n\n\u201cThere may be real crimes he\u2019s investigating, or reconsidering past charging decisions, especially leaks,\u201d Wheeler wrote Friday.\n\n\u201cBut at least thus far, Durham has spent six months without corroborating the main conspiracy theories about the investigation.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Impeachment gaining strength \u2013\n\nThe investigation comes as the impeachment probe in Congress gains momentum and could see formal impeachment articles presented before the end of the year.\n\nIn closed-door interviews 10 witnesses \u2014 including White House, State Department and Defense Department officials \u2014 have supported a whistleblower\u2019s allegations that between April and September Trump sought to force Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to open corruption investigations into Trump\u2019s possible 2020 rival Joe Biden, and into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine assisted the Democrats in 2016.\n\nThe witnesses have described Trump holding back nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelensky to act \u2014 which Democrats say was extortion and abuse of power by the US president.\n\nDemocrats are looking to hear from more \u2014 they issued subpoenas for two White House officials and one from the State Department Friday and were reportedly negotiating with former national security advisor John Bolton to testify.\n\nOther witnesses have told investigators that Bolton opposed Trump\u2019s use of aid to pressure Zelensky.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Democrats accused President Donald Trump on Friday of using the US Justice Department as a political tool after it opened a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/a9e5e5_us-attorney-william-barr-is-overseeing-inquiry-investigation-examining-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
