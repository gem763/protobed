TT specializes in long-term bets and alternative strategies.\n\nUS firm Whitebox Advisors, which is multi-strategy alternative asset manager, held about 3.15%. TT and Whitebox have been holding these positions the longest \u2014 since end of March when the stock was worth about 25 pence.\n\nSilver Point Capital, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut, also had a short position making up about 0.9% of the shares.\n\nShort positions built up over time. Breakout Point\n\nMelqart, TT, and Whitebox declined to comment. A request for comment from Silver Point was not immediately returned.\n\nThomas Cook is the most shorted UK stock in Breakout Point's records, with the research firm saying the stock had the biggest rise in short interest in UK in 2019.\n\nSo called big shorts, or those making up more than 0.5% of the traded stock, went from 0% in January to as much as 10.7%.\n\nIt's tricky to know which funds shorted outright and which bets were intended to hedge against other positions.\n\nThis makes calculating how much any fund profited from these short bets a difficult task. But as of July 13, short interest was about 10% while the market cap of the stock was about \u00a3200 million, Breakout Point said.\n\n\"Assuming that approximately all were kept until zero \u2014 there were some decreases and increases in-between, so this is an approximation \u2014 then short-selling hedge funds gained about \u00a320 million ($25 million) from these shorts,\" the firm said.\n\nThe British travel company and airline declared bankruptcy on Monday, stranding about 600,000 people globally. The company had been holding a series of crisis talks with potential buyers and the UK government.\n\n\"They were holding to their shorts even as market cap went down to sub \u00a3100 million levels, and in spite of several significant price spikes,\" Breakout Point said to Business Insider, which suggests a very high-conviction position.\n\nUnlike in the US, some European regulators require funds to disclose short positions in stocks that breach 0.5% of the outstanding shares. Breakout Point then analyzes the hedge fund filings.\n\nSome did warn that Thomas Cook's demise was a possibility. Barclays analysts, after cutting the price target from 46 pence to 17 pence in June, said: \" We believe it (TCG) could double or go to zero pence.\"", "description": "Thomas Cook is among the UK's most shorted stocks.
