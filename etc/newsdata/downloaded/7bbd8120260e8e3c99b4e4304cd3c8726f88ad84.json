FOREX-Dollar weak as Brexit deal boosts euro, sterling\n\n* Dollar weaker against most majors\n\n* Sterling higher ahead of parliament vote on Brexit deal\n\n(Updates to U.S. afternoon)\n\nBy Saqib Iqbal Ahmed\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The dollar fell sharply against\n\nthe euro on Friday as the common currency jumped on hopes that a\n\nBrexit deal between Britain and the European Union could improve\n\nthe odds of the euro zone avoiding a recession for now.\n\nIn one of the most striking flourishes of the three-year\n\nBrexit drama, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confounded\n\nhis opponents on Thursday by clinching a new deal with the EU,\n\neven though the bloc had promised it would never reopen a treaty\n\nit agreed last year. The euro has been rattled this year by dismal manufacturing\n\ndata and by worries that deepening economic tensions between the\n\nUnited States and China could slow euro zone economies even\n\nfurther.\n\nBut with Britain's Johnson and EU leaders agreeing a new\n\ndeal for Britain to exit the bloc, and no recent bad news on\n\nthe U.S.-China trade front, the euro was getting a boost.\n\n\"While the results of tomorrow's vote is far from certain,\n\nwe see the progress made over the past week as diminishing the\n\nchances of a no-deal Brexit,\" said John Doyle, vice president\n\nfor dealing and trading at Tempus Inc in Washington.\n\n\"A no-deal Brexit would be devastating for the U.K. economy,\n\nbut the ripple effects into the mainland would be substantial,\"\n\nDoyle said. \"That has helped lift equity markets, regional\n\ncurrencies and put downward pressure on the greenback.\"\n\nThe euro was up 0.32% at $1.1158, a near two-month high.\n\nThe respite for the euro comes as U.S. economic data have\n\ngrown increasingly gloomy, a development that could see the U.S.\n\nFederal Reserve cut interest rates later this month, its third\n\nrate cut this year.\n\nPoor domestic data makes deeper cuts in U.S. interest rates\n\na touch more likely, Tempus' Doyle said.\n\nThe dollar index , which compares the dollar against\n\nsix major currencies, was down 0.31%. For the week, the index\n\nwas down 1%, its worst weekly performance in 17 weeks.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in an 82% chance of a rate cut at\n\nthe Oct. 30 meeting, Refinitiv data show.\n\nThe pound was 0.45% higher against the dollar at $1.2946 on\n\nFriday, even as doubts remained about whether the proposed\n\nBrexit deal will get through the British parliament in\n\nSaturday's vote.\n\nThe yuan held steady against the dollar after data showed\n\nChina's economy grew at the slowest pace in more than 27 years\n\nin the third quarter, owing to the trade war with the United\n\nStates and weak factory production.
