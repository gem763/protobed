Kelley in 1999, but the drama award went to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaisel\u201d also won five Emmys last year. \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d meanwhile, took this year\u2019s Emmys for a variety sketch series.\n\n(Updates with best comedy Emmy in second paragraph)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Lucas Shaw in Los Angeles at lshaw31@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nick Turner at nturner7@bloomberg.net, Virginia Van Natta\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s \u201cFleabag\u201d and \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d pulled off a near-sweep of the comedy Emmys awarded on Sunday night, cementing the company\u2019s status as an outlet for high-brow humor.\u201cMaisel,\u201d a show about a New York housewife turned standup comic, picked up statuettes for best", "authors": ["Lucas Shaw"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e7QPmZd.aKhRBPT4uNRzdw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/5a5e96bf6d1638c7b008476a367b5ebf", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
