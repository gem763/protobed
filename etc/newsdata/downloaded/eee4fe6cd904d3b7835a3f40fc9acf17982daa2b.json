The actress, who was at TIFF to promote her new film Seberg, told Variety, \u201c\u201cI feel like he\u2019s the only guy that could play that part. I\u2019m so happy for him.\u201d A fair amount of online backlash followed the news of Pattinson\u2019s casting as the iconic character, particularly from die-hard fans of the franchise, and Pattinson himself revealed that he was \u201cfurious\u201d about the leak of the casting news. But now that he has Stewart\u2019s blessing, we can all rest easier. Both actors have become something of indie darlings in their post-Twilight careers, and if Pattinson\u2019s wig work in The King is any indication, he\u2019s more than up to the job.", "description": "Kristen Stewart voiced her support for former Twilight costar Robert Pattinson\u2019s casting as Batman in the upcoming film.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/07/kristenstewart_7.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
