Stone was acquired from the Senators at the trade deadline in February for Oscar Lindberg, prospect Erik Brannstrom and a 2020 second-round pick.\n\nReilly Smith and Nick Holden scored for Vegas.\n\nMarc-Andre Fleury made 37 saves. Fleury had a career 3.44 goals-against average against Ottawa, the highest of any other opponent, entering the game.\n\nThomas Chabot and Jean-Gabriel Pageau scored for Ottawa.\n\nAnders Nilsson, who lost his only previous start against Vegas by allowing five goals, made 52 saves.\n\nThe Senators outshot the Golden Knights 5-2 in overtime, and Fleury came up with several huge saves to keep the game going.\n\nSmith gave the Golden Knights a 1-0 lead when he took a pass from Jonathan Marchessault and backhanded a shot under Nilsson\u2019s pads 4:12 into the game.\n\nThe lead wouldn\u2019t last. Chabot sent a wrist shot past Fleury to tie the game 1-1.\n\nVegas went back on top later in the period when Holden scored his first goal of the season. On the power play, Holden\u2019s one-timer bounced off a stick and into the net. Stone earned his 200th career assist.\n\nAfter a scoreless second period, the Senators tied the game when Pageau smacked a rebound past Fleury\u2019s glove just 4:25 into the third period.\n\nNOTES: Vegas forward Valentin Zykov was suspended 20 games earlier in the day, for violating the league\u2019s performance-enhancing substances, and was replaced in the lineup by Brandon Pirri. \u2026 Golden Knights winger Max Pacioretty played in his 700th career NHL game. \u2026 Vegas\u2019 Gerard Gallant coached in his 500th career game. \u2026 Ottawa center Artem Anisimov, who was scratched Monday against Minnesota because of a lower-body injury, left practice early Wednesday and was scratched again. \u2026 Attending the game was Seattle\u2019s GM Ron Francis and scout Ulf Samuelsson.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nOttawa: Continues a three-game trip at Arizona on Saturday.\n\nVegas: Begins a three-game trip at Pittsburgh on Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/tag/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonathan Marchessault scored his first career shootout game-winning goal and the Vegas Golden Knights beat the Ottawa Senators 3-2 on Thursday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "W.G.
