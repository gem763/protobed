We could be within weeks of an election and we want to use this conference to parade some of our great policies, and all everyone is talking about is Brexit and disunity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the party leadership lashed out at the media, with Mr Corbyn himself releasing a video in which he accused the BBC of being part of an establishment which was \u201cclosing ranks\u201d with the government.\n\nMr Fisher\u2019s bombshell departure came after he sent a memo to close colleagues complaining of a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d among the leader\u2019s team and accusing them of a \u201cblizzard of lies and excuses\u201d.\n\nMr Corbyn said the note was prompted by Mr Fisher being \u201cextremely distressed\u201d over a particular discussion within the leader\u2019s office and insisted his decision to quit was driven by a desire to spend more time with his family.", "description": "Labour\u2019s crucial pre-election conference has been riven by disunity, with divisions over Brexit boiling over amid faction fighting over the future of the leadership.
