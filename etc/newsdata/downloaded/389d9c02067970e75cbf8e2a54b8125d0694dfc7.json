In the 100 Premier League matches this season, there have been 26 overturned decisions.\n\nHowever, due to the existing policy, there has not been one instance in which the referee has consulted the screen to review a decision.\n\nAfter his side\u2019s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Sunday, Arsenal manager Unai Emery called on officials to be permitted to use the monitors.\n\nHe said: \u2018We have cameras by the pitch but I don\u2019t remember a single referee going to check on the touchline.\u2019", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The meeting will provide a progress report on how the introduction of the technology has gone in the first two months of the season.", "authors": ["Sami Mokbel For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/22/20300590-0-image-a-12_1572302704788.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
