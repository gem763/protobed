Two years later, kidnappers in the Ukraine made more than $1 million after successfully ransoming a cryptocurrency analyst.\n\nEarlier this year, three robbers disguised as police entered a victim's home in Drenthe in the Netherlands and tortured a man with a drill in an attempt to get access to his bitcoin. The one-hour ordeal took place in front of the victim's four-year-old daughter but was ultimately unsuccessful.", "description": "A Norwegian multi-millionaire jumped from a second-story balcony in Oslo following an attempted armed robbery, according to local reports.
