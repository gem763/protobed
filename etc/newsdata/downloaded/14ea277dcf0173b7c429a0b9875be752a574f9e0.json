That\u2019s why I am able to visit this day. Back then solidarity with Busan showed it could endure through the problems it was having with politics. And I hope we can do the same today.\u201dThe 57-year-old won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or last year for his family drama \u201cShoplifters,\u201d a cutting look at a family living on the edges of Japanese society.He has returned to BIFF this year with the family drama \u201cThe Truth,\u201d his first non-Japanese feature.AFP", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/06194319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
