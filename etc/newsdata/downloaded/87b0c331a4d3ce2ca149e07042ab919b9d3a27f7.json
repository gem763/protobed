With just four games to go, we assess the performances of the three teams that made it to the knockout stages.\n\nEngland (Played four, won four \u2013 semi-final vs New Zealand)\n\nEngland have made good progress through the Rugby World Cup so far (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Come into modern rugby. Join us,\u2019 Eddie Jones quipped in his post-match press conference after destroying the country of his birth in a Rugby World Cup quarter-final.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis decision to drop, as some would have it, or redeploy, as Jones would have it, George Ford to the bench was a bold one and it fully paid off.\n\nThe coach predicted a back-foot first half and a more broken game in which Ford could thrive later on. Even he admitted it went perfectly to plan.\n\nWorld Cup semi-finals England v New Zealand (26 Oct) Wales vs South Africa (27 Oct)\n\nBarring the typhoon\u2019s disruption of their final group game, which in the end ensured would win their pool, very little has not gone to plan for England and certainly the things they have been able to control, they done so.\n\nIf there are concerns, it is of the defensive form of Henry Slade.\n\nNew Zealand will have enjoyed watching Slade slip and slide out of position and while the winger is a ridiculously talented attacker, he has spent a lot of time on the sidelines, which seemed to affect his reading of the game. He cannot play like that against the All Blacks.\n\nPros: Controlling games at will, able to change game plan from Ford-Farrell axis to Farrell-Tuilagi-Slade easily, yet to suffer major injury\n\nCons: Australian runners found some joy in outside channels, still only one real test so far\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nIreland (Played five, won three \u2013 OUT in the quarter-finals vs New Zealand)\n\nIreland were left distraught by yet another quarter-final defeat (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe curse is real. So very real. In fairness, New Zealand were absolutely stellar and it\u2019s hard to imagine that any team could have kept them at bay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut to concede seven tries, even against an all-time great All Blacks team at full steam, will not sit well with Andy Farrell, whose defence was the envy of the rugby world just 18 months ago.\n\nThe Englishman will take over from Joe Schmidt, whose hand was shaken hundreds of times after the final whistle as Irish fans thanked him for his six years of service and success.\n\nThey were as recently as this summer the world\u2019s No 1 side but must know they are a long way from that now. A rebuild is in order.\n\nPros: A dominant win over Scotland, James Ryan ready to lead the next generation\n\nCons: Life after Sexton, Murray and Best looks uncertain, style of rugby has been found out\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nWales (Played five, won five \u2013 semi-final vs South Africa)\n\nWales left it late to beat France and reach the semi-finals (Picture: Getty)\n\nFor all that they are back in the World Cup last four, it hasn\u2019t been easy. Not many fans back in Wales or out in Japan will have many fingernails left.\n\nThe first quarter against Australia was magnificent but they allowed the Wallabies back into the game and almost ended up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\nThey let Fiji score three tries but still came away with maximum points.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey played poorly throughout against France but were gifted a one-man advantage by Sebastien Vahaamahina.\n\nWinning ugly is still winning, which is, as Warren Gatland rightly said, a habit. Can it be a habit lasts a little longer? They might need to be a little bit more complete.\n\nPros: Unbeaten, scored tries when they have needed too, Dan Biggar still in one piece\n\nCons: Jonathan Davies still struggling with a knee injury, very few 80-minute performances\n\nRating: 6/10", "description": "The Rugby World Cup is down to four and we still, just about, have a potential all-Home Nations final with two Six Nations sides into the semi-finals.", "authors": ["James Gray"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176856443_1571574250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
