This week the NY Times delivered yet another classic spook tale dressed as serious news.\n\nAmong its splash articles, under the headline \u2018Top Secret Russian Unit Seeks to Destabilize Europe, Security Officials Say\u2019, readers were told of an elite Russian spy team which has, allegedly, only recently been discovered.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201cUnit 29155\u201d and purportedly directed by the Kremlin to \u201cdestabilize Europe\u201d with \u201csubversion, sabotage and assassination.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NY Times, this crack squad of Russia\u2019s most ruthless military intelligence agents were involved in an attempted assassination of an arms dealer in Bulgaria in 2015; the destabilization of Moldova; a failed coup against the Montenegrin government; and the alleged poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal in England last year.\n\nThe article states: \u201cWestern security officials have now concluded that these operations, and potentially many others, are part of a coordinated and ongoing campaign to destabilize Europe, executed by an elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage and assassination.\u201d\n\nThe NY Times adds: \u201cThe purpose of Unit 29155, which has not been previously reported, underscores the degree to which the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, is actively fighting the West with his brand of so-called hybrid warfare \u2014 a blend of propaganda, hacking attacks and disinformation \u2014 as well as open military confrontation.\u201d\n\nThis is all because, the readers are told, \u201cThe Kremlin sees Russia as being at war with a Western liberal order that it views as an existential threat.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Wilderness of mirrors: MI6, the Cold War, spies and traitors from Gordievsky to Skripal\n\nIn response, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed it as more of the \u201cpulp fiction category\u201d which Western news media have manufactured with seeming increasing intensity over recent years. Peskov pointed out that Moscow has repeatedly stated its desire to normalize relations with Western states and the European Union in particular, contradicting the theme of the NY Times\u2019 piece.\n\nIndeed, the Russian Embassy in Britain recently published a compilation of false articles peddled by Western media over the past four years. The NY Times features prominently as one of the main purveyors of scare stories about alleged malign Russian activities, from hacking into presidential elections, to targeting American power grids, to covert collusion with President Donald Trump.\n\nFor students of Propaganda 101, this week\u2019s tale makes a case study of how disinformation is disseminated in the guise of \u201cnews reporting.\u201d\n\nFirst of all, the NY Times reporter, Michael Schwirtz, gives a meandering account of lurid dirty deeds performed in various international locations allegedly carried out by the supposed \u201celite\u201d Kremlin hybrid warriors. But tellingly, there are no details evidencing Russian involvement. It\u2019s all lurid speculation spiced with fear-mongering, which reads like a pallid John le Carr\u00e9 spy novel.\n\nThen, the usual giveaway that the NY Times is engaging in disinformation, it quotes anonymous security officials for apparent verification of its claims about \u201cUnit 29155\u201d. This is tacit admission of who the real authors are: Western spooks.\n\nREAD MORE: Problem of NYT 1619 Project isn\u2019t that it sees America through slavery, it\u2019s that it tells untruths\n\nNext, a neat effort to give the lame story some legs is to quote named public figures. But these sources don\u2019t confirm the existence of the alleged Kremlin unit; they are merely invited to speculate on its existence and presumed malign purpose. One of those named sources is MI6 chief Alex Younger. Yes, that\u2019s right, the paper of record is quoting British military intelligence as a reliable source for public information. Another named source is Peter Zwack, who is described as a former US military intelligence officer who worked at the American Embassy in Moscow. Zwack is quoted as describing Russians as \u201corganically ruthless\u201d (whatever that means), while the paper actually admits that \u201che was not aware of the unit\u2019s existence.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of throwing a few names into the reporting mix is to lend a veneer of credibility to the nebulous, unverifiable, scary stuff that the anonymous spooks feed the reporter.\n\nAlso on rt.com Hollywood\u2019s malicious propaganda dehumanizes all Russians\n\nA special mention must be given to a third named source quoted by the NY Times. He is Eerik-Niiles Kross, an Estonian lawmaker and former military intelligence chief in Tallinn. He styles himself as \u201cEstonia\u2019s James Bond,\u201d and is known for his salacious Russophobic warnings of \u201cimminent invasion of the Baltic states\u201d \u2013 over the past three decades. Kross is quoted to speculate on the existence of the alleged Kremlin hybrid warfare unit. Of course, he dutifully serves up his notorious anti-Russian fear-mongering. But he is not confirming. His speculation is pseudo-validation of information that is essentially fictional.\n\nAll in all, the latest installment of anti-Russia propaganda from the NY Times this week is a damp squib among many previous baseless reports of alleged Kremlin malign activity. If it serves any purpose, it is perhaps a choice illustration of how disinformation is sneakily, insidiously presented as \u2018news\u2019. The fact that this should appear in a Pulitzer Prize-winning, supposedly premier, American newspaper is the disturbing part.\n\nBut it is no surprise to those who have long studied how the US corporate media has been under the control of state intelligence agencies for many decades, especially after the Second World War and during the subsequent Cold War against the Soviet Union.\n\nIn a seminal essay in 1977 for Rolling Stone magazine, award-winning journalist Carl Bernstein documented how the CIA systematically cultivated hundreds of reporters, columnists, editors, publishing executives and broadcast networks to function as conduits for disinformation \u2013 much of it directed at demonizing the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset, the use of journalists was among the CIA\u2019s most sensitive undertakings,\u201d writes Bernstein.\n\nHe added: \u201cBy far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times, CBS and Time Inc.\u201d\n\nHow the CIA goes about planting false stories in the American and European media is outlined in this candid interview by John Stockwell, who was former National Security Council coordinator for the agency during the 1970s. Stockwell also added: \u201cEnemies are necessary for the wheels of the US military machine to turn.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Hey, NYT! If Sentsov is living proof that Crimean Russians never wanted to be with Russia, how come he says otherwise?\n\nYou may wonder, if the Cold War ended nearly 30 years ago when the Soviet Union dissolved, why then do the NY Times and other Western media outlets continue to pump out anti-Russian propaganda? But that assumes the Cold War was primarily about the US opposing the ideology of communism. It wasn\u2019t. It was, and still is, all about imposing control over the masses so they don\u2019t ever challenge the power structure that deprives them of full democratic rights and decent livelihoods.\n\nIn a recent interview, philosopher Andr\u00e9 Vitchek makes the point that Western politicians and media like the NY Times keep harping on Cold War scare stories about evil foreigners in order \u201cto distract their citizens from thinking about their increasingly limited freedoms and diminishing standards of living.\u201d\n\nThe Cold War continues, and anti-Russia hysteria is but a distraction, as was the anti-Soviet hysteria. The aim is to distract the public from the real Cold War which is a war by the elites against democracy ever being actually realized among the masses.\n\nLike this story?
