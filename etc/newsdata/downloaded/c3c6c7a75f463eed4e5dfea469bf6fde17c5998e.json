Demonstrators playing steel drums marched through central London on Monday as they kicked off two weeks of activities designed to disrupt the city.\n\nThe arrests come as protesters in cities across Europe blocked roads ahead of what is being described as widespread demonstrations. Extinction Rebellion says protesters were arrested as they blocked Victoria Embankment outside the Ministry of Defense in London.\n\nIn Amsterdam, hundreds of demonstrators blocked a major road outside the Rijksmuseum, one of the city's most popular tourist attractions, and set up tents. The protest went ahead despite a city ban on activists gathering on the road. The protesters ignored police calls for them to move to a nearby square.
