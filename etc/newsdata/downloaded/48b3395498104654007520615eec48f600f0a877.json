Mr Morrison parried questions over controversial Liberal MP Gladys Liu's loyalty as a \"smear\" against all Chinese Australians, while Mr Marles said good relations between the two countries was important to that community.\n\nProfessor Fitzgerald identified numerous examples of China's Communist Party and government officials seeking to divide the Australian public by suggesting any hint of criticism of the CCP, or its influence operations, was racist. One example was in June 2018 when the Chinese ambassador urged the government to end \"bigotry\" in the relationship amid debate over the passage of foreign interference laws.\n\nHe said Chinese officials, media and intellectuals echoed these claims of racism, while its champions abroad \"obscure critical differences between the concepts of party, government and people to ensure that any criticism of the party or government can be dismissed as \u2018anti-Chinese\u2019 bigotry\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo maintain social cohesion, such language needs to be called out.\n\n\"The orchestration of the party\u2019s wedging exercise is clear from the absence of alternative voices among people of goodwill in China prepared to challenge claims of racism and bigotry,\" the report said.\n\n\"Chinese Government claims of Australian racism aren\u2019t widely challenged in Australia either. To date, no Australian Government representative has publicly repudiated official accusations of racism and bigotry levelled against Australia.\n\n\"The result is some Chinese-Australians, along with other\n\nAustralians, are misled into thinking criticism of China is \u2018racist\u2019, particularly when it\u2019s tagged to historical references to racial discrimination in Australia.\"\n\nProfessor Fitzgerald said otherwise well-founded media reporting on the Communist Party and its influence activities could inadvertently target Chinese-Australians unless carefully managed. He cited how the word \"Chinese\" is vague and can have a number of distinct meanings.\n\n\"All concerns arising from confusion between improper Chinese Government interference in Australia on the one side and legitimate Chinese-Australian community organisation, publication and political\n\nactivity on the other need to be addressed and allayed,\" Professor Fitzgerald said.", "description": "A leading academic warns China's Communist government is driving a wedge in Australian communities by distorting legitimate criticism of its activities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4ab235370925c874a9e5b70d61e0fcd3112a4714", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
