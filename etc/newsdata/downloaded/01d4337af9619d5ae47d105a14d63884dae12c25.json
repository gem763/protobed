Here\u2019s how she came to understand the world of esports.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s still surreal to us,\u201d Christine said. \u201cYou hear about people becoming professional esports players and to us, it was one of those far-off dreams, like your kid being a pro soccer player or pro football player. It feels like that.\u201d\n\nEthan, now 18, is publicly known by his gamertag \u201cStratus,\" a name he chose to honor his dead cat. It\u2019s a name Christine said she has grown used to, although hearing it applied to her son and not their deceased pet was \u201creally odd\u201d at first. Stratus is now among a handful of elite gamers who have gone pro in Overwatch, a six-on-six, sci-fi, first-person-shooter (FPS) game. He signed last winter with the Washington Justice, one of the 20 teams in the professional Overwatch League (OWL).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChristine said she used to receive confused responses from other parents when she told them about her son\u2019s career. \u201cProfessional gamer? What does that mean?\u201d she recalled them saying. But recently, she has noticed a shifting attitude toward the profession, and the gaming industry in general.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, when [Ethan] first started playing, there was more of a negative connotation to [esports],\u201d Christine said. \u201cNow, people are so positive because it's such a growing industry and they are really recognizing the big names that are behind a lot of the teams.\u201d\n\nThese big names include franchise owners of professional sports teams, such as Robert Kraft (New England Patriots) and Stan Kroenke (Los Angeles Rams, among others), who have contributed to the reported $4.5 billion invested in the industry last year. Additionally, major companies like Intel, Toyota, T-Mobile and Spotify have launched sponsorship deals with the league, while ESPN, Disney XD and ABC are broadcast partners for OWL events, propelling the public image of esports higher over the past several years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to growth at the pro level, esports are trickling into the world of academia. During the last school year, $16 million in esports scholarships were offered nationwide, according to the nearly 200-members of the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE).\n\nEsports will also become a varsity-sanctioned high school activity in at least 17 states this year through a pilot program launched by the National Federation of State High School Associations in partnership with PlayVS.\n\n\u201cMore people are becoming exposed to [video games] as a sport,\u201d said Dr. Rachel Kowert, a researcher of online gaming and author of the book A Parent\u2019s Guide to Video Games. \u201cBut the perception of video games as being frivolous at best and dangerous at worst, that's a slow moving engine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKowert said parents\u2019 greatest concerns with gaming are fearing two overhyped outcomes: addiction and violence. Kowert has studied the relationship between gaming and addiction and aggression for over 20 years, and said those claims have largely been debunked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf you look at the thousands of studies that have been done about the effects of video games on anything, positive or negative, the results are generally neutral,\u201d Kowert said. \u201cThey're doing nothing, or they\u2019re doing something slightly positive.\u201d\n\nFor parents, navigating a space they often don\u2019t understand, especially at the highest level, comes with its own set of challenges. Christine said that attending Stratus\u2019s first live tournament event in Montreal was the moment that opened her eyes to the scope of the professional gaming industry and his career potential.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOnce we saw the fans there, we saw the setup, we saw the professionals that were behind the team, it became a lot more real for us,\u201d Christine said. \u201cShortly after, he had gotten a contract to be a part of a team. Lawyers were involved. All of that became a real job very quickly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFrom that point, the biggest challenge became grappling with her son leaving home early to work. Ethan joined a minor league team when he was just 17. He signed a contract in the OWL, which has an 18-year-old minimum age requirement, the following year.\n\n\u201cBeing a parent and having your child working away from home, that\u2019s obviously difficult,\u201d Christine said. \u201cTo make that choice and make sure he was going to be taken care of, that was one thing we didn\u2019t really expect when all of this came about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChristine sought advice from lawyers, industry experts and other parents who had already navigated the process. Unfamiliar with Overwatch, she also had to learn from her son how the game actually worked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to speak a different language to somebody,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of lingo that\u2019s commonly tossed around for people who play a lot of video games that just doesn\u2019t make any sense normally.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nChristine said she kept watching the matches and asking her son to pause them and explain plays. Now, she gets it.\n\n\u201cAt first it\u2019s hard to see who\u2019s playing well and who died,\u201d Christine said. \u201cIt took a while, but I think we\u2019re there now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEven at the amateur and casual levels, parents understanding their children\u2019s gaming habits is beneficial to reduce misconceptions, Kowert said. She recommends parents learn about the games their children are playing to combat what she calls \u201cmedia sensationalism\u201d or a fear of the unknown.\n\n\u201cIf you don't know anything about the technology or what your kids are doing, then of course that's going to stir up fear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's understandable. But the more you're exposed to it and the more you're familiar with it, the less scary it becomes.\u201d\n\nChristine said gaming was part of her family\u2019s culture, so she had some understanding of its benefits. Christine plays Clash Royale and mobile games, Ethan\u2019s grandmother, Kay Yankel, plays Candy Crush and Ethan and his brothers were into Counterstrike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) before switching to Overwatch. The entire Yankel clan also plays board games together.\n\nThis is what Kowert recommends: trust and time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cParents will sit and watch their young children play tee-ball for three hours on a Saturday afternoon, and it is not enjoyable,\u201d Kowert said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t sit down for an hour and watch their child play Fortnite. The more familiar they are with what their kids are interacting with, the less panic there is from the parents.\u201d\n\nEthan and Christine understand gaming is part of their family\u2019s fabric, but both know his time in the OWL won\u2019t last forever. Most esports players retire by their late 20s or early 30s, according to CNBC.\n\nWith more colleges offering esports programs and scholarships, Ethan said he would consider going back to school after he retires from professional esports, and perhaps even attend the same college as his older brother.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy brother told me that Carnegie Mellon University started an Overwatch program,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cIf I could get into that school with a scholarship, I\u2019d be totally down for that. It kind of depends on what opportunities exist.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of his next step, Christine said she would \"support anything that [her] kids work hard at,\u201d just as she has done with gaming.\n\n\u201cNot just their dreams, but that they have a solid action plan to reach their goals,\" she said. \"And when they do that, we\u2019ll support them in anything.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "description": "It took \"negotiations\" and education, but the mother of a professional Overwatch League player has gotten a good grasp of a world some view with skepticism.", "authors": ["Alex Andrejev", "Sports Intern"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GVzIWgIaIS0TlS2E8X-yqDJCHHY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EH5S4VHEQYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
