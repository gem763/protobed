But I\u2019d also like to remember that the M5S, before the elections last year, had said they were ready to join any political force that was ready to carry out the Movement\u2019s political agenda. Today, we have a great chance to change this country.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday an M5S blog said the government programme agreed with PS would be available online to members when voting starts.\n\nThe M5S senate whip, Stefano Patuanelli, said on Monday that if a majority of participants in the polls voted \u201cno\u201d then Conte would have to tell the president, Sergio Mattarella, that his attempt to form a government had failed. The M5S leader, Luigi Di Maio, told a meeting of his deputies that everything depended on the Rousseau vote.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A user points at their computer screen while using M5S\u2019s Rousseau digital platform.

The most recent online ballot was on whether to vote in parliament to defend Salvini from prosecution for preventing migrants disembarking from an Italian coastguard ship.\n\nItaly was plunged into chaos last month when Salvini withdrew the League from its fractious alliance with M5S, as he sought to exploit his party\u2019s popularity to bring about snap elections and become prime minister.\n\nThe dramatic move threatened to create a fully far-right government. But Salvini, whose tactics have dented his popularity in recent weeks, had not banked on M5S teaming up with the PD. Though the two parties are longstanding enemies, they are also the two largest parties in parliament.\n\nIf Conte fails to form a new government, Mattarella is likely to call for new elections.\n\nThe League remains the most popular party, despite toppling the government. A poll published on Saturday by Corriere della Sera showed support for the League fell to 31.8% from a mid-July record high of 35.9%. M5S rose almost seven percentage points from mid-July to 24.2% according to the same poll, while the PD rose marginally to 22.3%.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Country could face fresh elections if party members reject pact with centre-left PD", "authors": ["Lorenzo Tondo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0d957ba498b52d9c5cd513be6778602e37fcea/0_47_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=703c87054b2fe734b7825cc687a013d0"}
