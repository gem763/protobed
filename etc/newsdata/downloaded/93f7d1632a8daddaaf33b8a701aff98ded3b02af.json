The event was held to mark the 1-year anniversary of the Pledge to America\u2019s Workers, a Trump economic initiative.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain the feeling, it was unreal,\u201d Brummit, who appeared sitting next to Ivanka Trump in official White House photos, told The Orlando Times following the event. \u201cWhen I got to speak to Ivanka one-on-one that made me feel even more comfortable.\"\n\n\u201cNot too many people get that experience and I really enjoyed myself there,\u201d he added.\n\nTRUMP PROMOTES JOB TRAINING AS EMPLOYERS SEARCH FOR WORKERS\n\nBut on Oct. 3, Brummit allegedly was involved in an attack on a security guard at a bus terminal in central Florida.\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel, citing an arrest affidavit, reported that Brummit\u2019s girlfriend, Talia Greene-Stover, had gotten into an argument with a Megabus employee who had asked her to not sit in a taxi stand area. A security guard there tried to diffuse the tensions, but then Brummit reportedly joined in on the argument.\n\nBrummit and Greene-Stover eventually departed the terminal, but before doing so, Brummit allegedly told the Megabus employee that he should leave work because he would be back, according to the newspaper.\n\nThey later returned to the facility with Greene-Stover\u2019s stepfather, James E. Hird Jr., and started assaulting the security guard, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Hird Jr., the affidavit says, is accused of firing multiple shots into the guard\u2019s shoulder and jaw.\n\nThe suspects fled the scene while the guard was rushed to a local hospital. He now is reported to be in stable condition.\n\nREPORTS OF SHOTS FIRED AT FLORIDA MALL SPARKS PANIC, POLICE RESPONSE\n\nBrummit though has been charged with attempted felony murder, robbery with a firearm and battery on a uniformed security officer, and is being held at the Orange County Jail, records show. Greene-Stover and Hird Jr. also are in custody on similar charges.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are really heavy for him, his family and the victim,\u201d Greg Higgerson, vice president of development at Second Harvest Food Bank, which runs the culinary program, told the Orlando Sentinel. \u201cHe shows great promise as a professional. Unfortunately, sixteen weeks in our program can teach a lot of things, but it can\u2019t teach personal decision-making.\u201d\n\nThe newspaper reported Brummit has previously admitted to having a juvenile arrest record.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt the time of his arrest last week, he reportedly was working as a prep cook at Aloft Hotel in Orlando \u2013 and had been promoted twice in the last six months.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just devastated over this,\u201d Aloft\u2019s general manager Craig Leicester, told the Orlando Sentinel. \"To be honest, it breaks my heart.\"", "description": "A 20-year-old man who spoke in front of President Trump and Vice President Pence at a White House event in July is now behind bars in Florida on charges including attempted felony murder and battery on a uniformed security officer.", "authors": ["Greg Norman"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Johnny-Brummit.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
