On the right, one of the loudest critics of the league\u2019s apology to China has been Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\n\nApparently, for Ingraham, NBA stars should absolutely speak up on hot-button issues. But only on the topics she deems permissible.\n\nLast year, Ingraham made headlines and inspired the title of LeBron James\u2019 documentary when she called on the NBA mega-star to \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d instead of talking about politics.\n\nIngraham\u2014who also once wrote a book called Shut Up and Sing\u2014said during the February 2018 segment that James\u2019 commentary about President Donald Trump was \u201cbarely intelligible\u201d and complained that people were taking it \u201cseriously,\u201d demanding instead that he keep his political remarks to himself.\n\nThough the Fox host\u2019s comments echoed a common theme of right-wing commentary\u2014that celebrities, musicians, and actors, most of whom skew liberal, should not talk politics\u2014quickly sparked widespread backlash and near-universal condemnation.\n\nBut now, Ingraham is calling on NBA stars and coaches to get political and speak out against China. During a lengthy monologue on Monday night, the right-wing pundit lambasted the silence from some of the league\u2019s most outspoken stars, notably taking issue with San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich, who has been highly critical of Trump in the past.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment, Gregg,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou have the audacity to lecture us on morality as your league is standing with one of the most repressive regimes in the world? Are you kidding me? Did he speak out today in support of Morey? I don\u2019t think so, no.\u201d\n\nIngraham also complained about basketball stars standing up for former NFL star Colin Kaepernik\u2019s right to kneel during the national anthem, insisting that the players\u2019 concerns for free expression has its limits as they \u201cquickly groveled to their Chinese masters,\u201d pointing to Rockets\u2019 star James Harden claiming \u201cwe love China.\u201d\n\nIngraham also took to Twitter to demand the athletes and coaches pipe up and make their voices heard. In a Monday evening tweet, she groused that they have been \u201cconveniently silent\u201d on Morey\u2019s support of a democratic movement in Hong Kong.\n\nAfter Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Tuesday that he had no comment about the China ordeal, the Fox News star retweeted Fox Sports personality Clay Travis\u2019 declaration that Kerr is a \u201ccomplete and total coward,\u201d adding: \u201cSteve Kerr, Gregg Popovich and all the other outspoken, anti-Trump, coaches in the @NBA suddenly find the question of opposing China\u2019s brutal oppression \u2018confusing.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollowing the widespread outrage over the league\u2019s initial apology to China\u2014a statement that included criticism of Morey\u2019s since-deleted tweet\u2014NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued a much stronger statement on Tuesday, saying the league would not regulate the speech of its players, employees, or team owners.\n\nWhile Chinese sponsors bolt from the league and Chinese state television has cancelled NBA game broadcasts, Silver noted Tuesday that it is \u201cinevitable that people around the world\u201d will have different viewpoints on certain issues and it\u2019s not the league\u2019s role to \u201cadjudicate those differences.\u201d", "description": "A year ago the right-wing Fox News host told the league\u2019s biggest star to \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d instead of talk Trump.
