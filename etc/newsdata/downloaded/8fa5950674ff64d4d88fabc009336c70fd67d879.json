Speaking about the president allows Mr. Biden to discuss foreign policy and national security, issues that his campaign has said differentiate Mr. Biden, a former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks give Mr. Biden the one-on-one showdown with the president that his campaign has spent months trying to create, it also exposes him and his son to another round of questions about Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine.\n\nThe Biden campaign moved quickly to warn the news media over the story, underscoring a deep concern about how allegations about the younger Mr. Biden\u2019s work will be received by voters. \u201cAny article, segment analysis and commentary that does not demonstrably state at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump\u2019s claim, and in fact that they are wholly discredited, is misleading readers and viewers ,\u201d said the deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, in an email to reporters.\n\nBut Biden advisers also seized on the furor to portray Mr. Trump as fixated on, and worried about, a potential general election race against Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cThere is only one candidate the president is trying to get foreign governments to dig up bogus dirt on,\u201d Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden, said.\n\nThe effort by the president and his team to shift the focus to Mr. Biden could boomerang, casting the Democratic front-runner as a sympathetic figure unfairly attacked with foreign help. It could just as easily mark a defining moment for Mr. Biden, a 76-year-old politician first elected to the Senate in 1972 and long accustomed to playing by the more genteel political rules of a different era.", "description": "The controversy centers on whether President Trump manipulated foreign policy to pressure Ukraine to take action to damage Joseph R.
