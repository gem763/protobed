That\u2019s the highest rate in comparable records that go back to 2001.\n\nRural support was critical to Trump\u2019s presidential victory, but it\u2019s unlikely to hold if voters lose their farms and livelihoods to the trade war. Wisconsin is a battleground swing state that went for Trump by fewer than 23,000 votes. He won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 votes.\n\nTrump has arranged a mammoth $28 billion subsidy from taxpayers for farmers to help them survive the trade war, but many say it won\u2019t be enough to make up for markets they have lost \u2014 possibly forever.\n\nAnother critical misjudgment by Trump \u2014 his decision to grant 31 refineries waivers allowing them to dodge corn-based ethanol requirements \u2014 is also alienating farmers.\n\nAides spelling out farmer anger over the waivers told a stunned Trump last month that he has a \u201cproblem\u201d in Iowa, Reuters reports.\n\nFormer Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, now U.S. ambassador to China, told Trump then that his loyal farmers won\u2019t stand for policies favoring the oil industry at their expense, sources told Reuters. Branstad reportedly showed Trump a map of counties that had flipped in his favor in 2016 but were now considered at risk for the next election.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s Republican Gov. Kristi Noem and Minnesota\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz fired off a joint letter to Trump earlier this week complaining that the waivers have triggered an increasing number of renewable fuel plants closing or slowing production. \u201cWe are extremely concerned about your administration\u2019s actions to continue to grant small refinery hardship waivers,\u201d the letter notes.\n\nThe recent @EPA small refinery waivers will have an impact on ethanol states like mine. Looking forward to @realDonaldTrump\u2019s plan to mitigate the sting. Appreciate his support for homegrown fuels. pic.twitter.com/eYxWDmm8WL \u2014 Governor Kristi Noem (@govkristinoem) September 5, 2019", "description": "The downturn in farm belt fortunes amid Trump's trade war with China isn't good for the president going into 2020.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7360d93b00002a74d0c119.jpeg?cache=a7ofae3alm&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
