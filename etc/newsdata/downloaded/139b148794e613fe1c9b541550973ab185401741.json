It occurred just six months after a deadly crash in Indonesia. In the months since, Boeing has halted deliveries of the plane while airlines operating it scrambled to fix flight schedules disrupted by the aircraft's grounding and the FAA grappled with questions about how and why it certified the jet as airworthy.\n\nInvestigators have focused on the jetliner's new anti-stall software system, which they believe interfered with the plane's ascent after takeoff.\n\nThe European safety agency says it's currently expending an \u201cunprecedented level of effort\u201d working with Boeing in its investigation, and that the remedy for the anti-stall system -- which are beleived to have erroneously determined that the downed airliners were climbing at a steep enough angle that their engines were likely to cut out -- isn't yet sufficient.\n\nThe agency said it's anticipating a week-long series of flight tests on the modified 737 Max that are set to occur at the Boeing Flight Test Center.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "Europe lays out four requirements before Boeing's 737 Max can return to its skies.", "authors": ["Frank J.
