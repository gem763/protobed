They began with a bat mitvah and ended with a rainbow Marc Jacobs collection. The Marc show in particular billed itself as a \u201ccelebration of life, joy, equality, individuality, optimism, happiness, indulgence, dreams and a future unwritten,\u201d as the designer\u2019s heartfelt show notes read. It sounds like a tall order, but this really was the theme of the week.\n\nSusan Alexandra\u2019s balloon-filled event was an expression of unabashed, childish joy. At Area, every outfit shimmered with gold and jewels while a disembodied voice recited a positivity mantra over the loudspeakers. Sies Marjan ended with a confetti firecracker. Brandon Maxwell was all smiles (and at least one enthusiastic audience member). Models danced at Deveaux. Kate Spade and Tory Burch were easy and lighthearted. The Pyer Moss show lifted everyone\u2019s spirit, following an energetic Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya performance uptown. Rihanna\u2019s Fenty x Savage show made Victoria\u2019s Secret look like a robot parade. Even Eckhaus Latta showed sequins! Some might call it a cheap Instagram grab, while others will predict a return to \u201980s extravagance. But perhaps it\u2019s just a much-needed injection of sunshine to keep us from thinking about the end of the world. Either way, Spongebob Yellow was the color of the season. And who is more optimistic than the man who lives in a pineapple under the sea?\n\nSome evidence, below.", "description": "According to the spring 2020 runways, dressing with optimism will be a trend next season.
