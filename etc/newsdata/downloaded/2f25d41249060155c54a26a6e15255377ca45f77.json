But cues of further monetary stimulus by central banks around the world calmed investor nerves later in the week.\n\nThe oil and gas sector gained 3.4 per cent in the week - its biggest weekly increase in four months.\n\nRetailers also led the benchmark STOXX 600 higher, with shares of Casino up 3.8 per cent after the debt-laden company said it was in talks to sell its discount store chain, Leader Price, to German rival Aldi.\n\nFriday's volatility also stemmed from \"quadruple witching\", where investors unwound positions in futures and options contracts before they expired.\n\nIn the week ahead, investors will also be watching for economic data from the euro zone and the United States, including preliminary PMIs and economic growth figures.\n\nShares in some of the biggest outperformers this year were weighing on the STOXX 600. Airbus, up 43 per cent so far this year, was down 3.2 per cent, and steady dividend-paying companies including Unilever and British American Tobacco were down at least 1.5 per cent.\n\nThe London-listed of these companies pushed the FTSE 100 down 0.2 per cent. It ended the week 0.3 per cent lower, breaking a three-week streak of gains.\n\nThe past few weeks saw investors rotate out of growth sectors and into value stocks, with beaten-down shares of banks in popular demand. However, the European banking index closed the week down 1 per cent as investors went back into the safety sectors.\n\nShares in Denmark's Jyske Bank jumped 5.3 per cent to the top of the STOXX 600 after the lender said people with more than US$111,100 in their accounts would be charged a deposit rate as it seeks to pass on some of the costs of recent rate cuts by the European and Danish central banks.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Stocks - [BENGALURU] European stocks clocked their fifth straight week of gains on Friday with investors buying into the oil and gas and banking sectors, and Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk rising after US approval of its oral diabetes drug. .
