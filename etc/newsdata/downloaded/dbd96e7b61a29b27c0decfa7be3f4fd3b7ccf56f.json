In the meantime England could not have come closer to a like-for-like replacement than Tom Banton, the leading English run-scorer in this year\u2019s county T20 competition.\n\nIn the international T20 format, which evolves so rapidly, Buttler has become one of England\u2019s first-choice opening batsmen: in his five innings since being promoted to open last year, he has launched England with 191 runs off 116 balls. The 20-year-old Banton, although nine years junior to Buttler, is following fast in his footsteps.\u200b\n\nThe same mould produced Buttler and Banton: playing cricket from infancy in the garden at home with a brother; hockey in winter to increase the strength and flexibility of forearms, wrists, hands and fingers; followed by schooling at King\u2019s College Taunton, and a contract with Somerset, where the home pitches are belters and some boundaries invitingly short.\u200b\n\nIt does no harm either if your father has played county cricket. Tom\u2019s father Colin was born in South Africa, moved to England and played a handful of games for Nottinghamshire as a batsman: he did make two first-class fifties in 1995 but one was against Oxford University, the other against Cambridge. \u201cHe signed for two years,\u201d Tom Banton said, \u201cand left after one year. He\u2019s never told me the reason why but he might not have been good enough.\u201d\u200b\n\nBut his father and mother, also sporty, provided exactly the right facilities for their two sons when they settled in England. \u201cDad used to own a wine business and we lived in France for two years when I was tiny, in Perpignan. My younger brother Jacques was born there.\u201d Colin set up an organic fruit and vegetable business, then became a property consultant, and chairman of Barnt Green CC.\u200b\n\nIt was in the back garden that Tom developed his default or \u201cgo-to\u201d shot through midwicket.\u200b", "description": "Jos Buttler is resting while England play their five-match T20 series in New Zealand, but will be back to bat and keep wicket in the two Tests that follow.", "authors": ["Scyld Berry", "Cricket Correspondent", "Cricket Journalist Of The Year", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000196380716-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqSwWTY-UeeSbs5bnk24ZjW131jWvPzo9NilV4Qnlejk8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
