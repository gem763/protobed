Parts of central London were brought to a standstill, as people chanted \"Boris Johnson, shame on you,\" BBC News reports.\n\nThe demonstrations were called ahead of what is expected to be a pitched debate in Parliament this week as Johnson's opponents scramble to try to pass legislation that would block him from carrying out Brexit on October 31 without an approved withdrawal agreement.\n\nAn estimated 10,000 people gathered in central London, while others protested in in Belfast, York and others cities to show determination to block a \"no deal\" Brexit. Protesters in London briefly blocked traffic on a downtown bridge and in Trafalgar Square.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who had urged his supporters to come out in large numbers, told thousands of people at a rally in Glasgow, Scotland that the message to Johnson was simple: \"No way. It's our Parliament.\"\n\nDemonstrators block the entrance to Whitehall during an anti-Brexit protest in London, Britain August 31, 2019.

Many economists and academics think a no-deal Brexit would lead Britain into a prolonged recession.\n\n\"It's not on and we're not having it,\" Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson's decision to shutter Parliament for several weeks when a debate about Brexit plans had been expected galvanized angry crowds of protesters on Saturday.\n\nThere was also a small group of counter-protesters, marching in support of Johnson, in Westminster, London.\n\nOrganizers said protests were held in more than 30 locations throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn London, they chanted: \"Boris Johnson, shame on you.\" Some carried signs saying: \"Stop the Coup\" in reference to what they say is a move that threatens democracy.\n\nThe protests were organized by the anti-Brexit group Another Europe Is Possible and by Momentum, which is allied with the opposition Labour Party. The group is urging its membership to \"occupy bridges and blockade roads.\"\n\nJohnson's plan is also being opposed by some in Parliament who plan to introduce legislation this week to try to prevent a disorderly departure from the European Union.\n\nAnti-Brexit demonstrators protest in Whitehall on August 31, 2019 in London, England.

Tactics could include introducing a variety of amendments that would have to be debated, or the use of filibusters to stall the process.\n\nThe shutdown of Parliament is also being challenged in three separate court cases scheduled to be heard next week.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Major has joined one of the lawsuits, raising the likelihood that he will argue in court that the current prime minister, a fellow member of the Conservative Party, is acting improperly by shutting Parliament.\n\nJohnson, who helped lead the successful Brexit referendum campaign, says his government is actively pursuing a new deal with EU leaders and claims opposition to his policy will make it harder to wring concessions from Europe.", "description": "An estimated 10,000 people gathered in central London, while others protested in in Belfast, York and others cities in support of blocking a \"no deal\" Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/31/f6136994-0eda-47be-a5ad-550bd3e6e28f/thumbnail/1200x630/29a4f6da47ea32f0d24647be0d9a8207/2019-08-31t172917z-86933121-rc1d34626c60-rtrmadp-3-britain-eu-protests.jpg"}
