(Photo: Universal)\n\nThe Turning, as you\u2019re about to find out, is about a mysterious haunted house. And yet all the ghosts and jump scares combined don\u2019t come close to the straight creepiness Stranger Things and It star Finn Wolfhard exhibits in this trailer.\n\nBased on the classic Henry James story The Turn of the Screw (just like the new season of The Haunting of Hill House, in fact), The Turning stars Mackenzie Davis (Terminator: Dark Fate) as the new nanny hired at a sprawling old estate. There, she\u2019s expected to care for two kids (Wolfhard and The Lego Movie 2's Brooklynn Prince) but realises much more is going on.\n\nCheck out this highly disturbing trailer.\n\nThe Turning is directed by Floria Sigismondi, who has helmed episodes of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, Daredevil, and American Gods. She\u2019s also a very prolific music video director and you get a sense of all that in this trailer. The visuals are gorgeous, gothic, and very scary. Combine that with this cast and it seems like we might be able to keep that October feeling going right into the new year.\n\nThe Turning opens on January 23, 2020.", "description": "The Turning, as you\u2019re about to find out, is about a mysterious haunted house.
