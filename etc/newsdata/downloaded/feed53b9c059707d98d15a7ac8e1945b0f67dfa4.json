(Kaveel Singh/News24)\n\nFormer president Jacob Zuma has, once again, bought himself some time after indicating that he intends to file an application for leave to appeal the dismissal of his permanent stay of prosecution bid.\n\nZuma briefly appeared in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday for the continuation of his fraud and corruption trial.\n\nThe former president's advocate, Thabani Masuku SC, said that while Zuma waited for 14 years for his day in court, he would still seek other legal avenues, as was his right.\n\n\"We have been ready for 14 years. Mr Zuma would, however, like to exercise his right to appeal the permanent stay of prosecution decision,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the High Court dismissed the stay of prosecution application which Zuma and co-accused, French arms company Thales, had lodged.\n\nZuma has until November 1 to file papers in the leave to appeal application.\n\nThat application will be heard on November 22 and the criminal trial will return on February 4, 2020, for pre-trial proceedings.\n\nSenior State advocate Billy Downer said the state would oppose the leave to appeal application.\n\n'We remain ready'\n\nHe said Zuma's co-accused Thales would have to have a representative present during the pre-trial proceedings.\n\nDowner said an updated forensic report has been handed to all the parties.\n\nAn upbeat Downer declared: \"We remain ready.\"\n\nAdvocate Anton Katz, who is representing Thales, said they were not opposed to the pre-trial conference date.\n\nZuma is expected to be tried on charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering.\n\nThe case involves 783 questionable payments Zuma allegedly received from the company in connection with the arms deal.\n\nFormer National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) boss Shaun Abrahams announced in March 2018 that the NPA would go ahead with the prosecution of Zuma, nine years after the charges were dropped.\n\nThe NPA argued that Zuma's legal teams had employed every conceivable trick in the book to delay the matter, News24 previously reported.", "description": "Former president Jacob Zuma has, once again, bought himself some time after indicating that he intends to file an application for leave to appeal the dismissal of his permanent stay of prosecution bid.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9474/1e1144e91c7f44f98a8dea7b85e7542e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
