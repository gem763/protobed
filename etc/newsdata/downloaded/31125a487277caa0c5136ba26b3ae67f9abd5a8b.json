Unless you had a Blackberry\u2014in which case, honestly, stop reading now\u2014texting required more thought and effort. We had to get creative and walk up a hill both ways to communicate simple sentiments like \u2018c u soon,\u2019 or \u2018meet @ 711\u2019 or \u2018i lik ur hairct :).\u2019 Today, the T9 text input system is nothing but a distant cultural memory, and it\u2019s so much easier to keep in touch with people it\u2019s not even funny. But somewhere down the line, we lost a little freedom; the freedom to spell badly. The freedom to type \u201comw\u201d without seeming too enthusiastic. I\u2019m talking about the freedom that came before autocorrect.\n\nThe concept of autocorrect was created by a Microsoft engineer in the 1990s and introduced to Apple in 2005. Both engineers spoke with Wired about their respective programs, the former in a 2014 profile and the latter in a 2018 op-ed, and sheepishly poked fun at the humorous mistakes that autocorrect is known for producing. But my main beef with autocorrect isn\u2019t that it\u2019s prone to amusing little errors (\u201cOh no, I meant to text my mom about pencils but my phone changed it to penis! Also, it\u2019s 2011 so this is still a viable joke format!\u201d). My issue with autocorrect is that it makes us lazy. Sometimes typos can be communicative in their own right! In the words of my editor, Rachel: \u201cIt\u2019s killing the vernacular.\u201d Are we so afraid of making mistakes that we\u2019re willing to sacrifice linguistic innovation?\n\nHow else would I have weirded out my roommate, who was looking forward to celebrating Yom Kippur?\n\nNow my friend knows, in no uncertain terms, that she's in for a treat for referring me to a dentist.\n\nDoesn't my excitement re: the Shawn Mendes origin story just LEAP off the screen?\n\nTyping sans autocorrect allows me to convey my emotions more clearly. I can spell my boyfriend\u2019s name a bunch of different ways when I tell my friends I\u2019m ditching them to watch The Sopranos with him. I can keyboard mash when someone sends me a picture of Bella Hadid looking iconic without worrying about accidentally sending a random string of words instead. That Spongebob meme wHeRe YoU tYpE lIkE tHiS was a cakewalk for me. Maybe I just like to live life a little dangerously, but I think there\u2019s something nice about a text typed with vigor, dashed off in the heat of the moment, with the misspellings to prove it.\n\nSkeptics, sadly, abound.\n\nOf course, I have received literal gasps of horror after telling people about my autocorrect policy. I\u2019m also pretty sure I\u2019ve never actually converted anyone to my point of view. But like all great iconoclasts and free-speech activists, I remain resolute in my beliefs. Because of my autocorrect-free lifestyle, I will never, ever be \u201cOn my way!\u201d ( ed. note: you can turn this off in settings, Katie.) (Author\u2019s note: idGaf!!!!11!!) unless it\u2019s on my own terms.
