The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\"\n\nCorbyn, who voted against Britain joining the EU back in 1975 and gave only reluctant backing to the \"remain\" campaign in the 2016 referendum, has previously only signalled lukewarm backing for another referendum.\n\nSaturday\u2019s sitting will take place against the backdrop of a large march through central London in favour of a second referendum.
