REUTERS/Dan Riedlhuber\n\nThe ruling means the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the state regulator that approved the Line 3 project last year, will not have to consider additional environmental issues.\n\nLine 3 is part of Enbridge\u2019s Mainline network that transports western Canadian oil to Midwest refineries. The replacement project would double current capacity to 760,000 barrels per day, providing much-needed relief from congestion on existing Canadian pipelines.\n\nPipelines carrying Canadian oil have for years fallen short of meeting demand due to delays of Line 3, the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain and TC Energy Corp\u2019s Keystone XL.\n\nLine 3 was meant to be in service by the end of this year but has been delayed until the second half of 2020 because of issues with permitting.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute welcomed the court\u2019s decision. Erin Roth, executive director of API Minnesota, said the MPUC will now be able to move forward with Line 3\u2019s environmental impact statement, and provide \u201cguidance on the remaining process and timeline to complete the project, which is the most studied pipeline project in state history.\u201d\n\nIn June, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that the Public Utilities Commission had failed to address how an oil spill from the line would affect Lake Superior within the project\u2019s environmental impact statement.\n\nGroups including Honor the Earth and the Mille Lac Band of Ojibwe that oppose replacement of Line 3, which was built in the 1960s, petitioned for the Supreme Court to review other aspects of the impact statement that the appeals court approved. Those petitions were denied on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe are profoundly disappointed that the Minnesota Supreme Court felt more interested in siding with the rights of a Canadian corporation to proceed with a high-risk project than protecting the rights of the Minnesota Anishinabe and indigenous people and the rights of nature,\u201d Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, said.\n\nCalgary-based Enbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company\u2019s shares closed up 0.15% on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$46.70.", "description": "The Minnesota Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear environmental and tribal challenges to Enbridge Inc's Line 3 oil pipeline, a decision that removes one potential obstacle for the already-delayed project.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430964427&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1Q8-OCADN", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
