Now, after two seasons, the league is looking to expand beyond the NBA with a new club based in Shanghai. The Chinese team will be the first in the league based outside of North America and the first not operated by an NBA team.\n\nThe currently unnamed squad will be owned and operated by Gen.G, a multigame e-sports organization that currently has teams in PUBG, Fortnite, League of Legends, and also owns the Seoul Dynasty of the Overwatch League. The Shanghai team will join the league in 2020, and it will be based out of Gen.G\u2019s Los Angeles office. Like all other 2K League teams, it will play games at the league\u2019s studio in New York.\n\nRead next: Why competitive gaming is starting to look a lot like professional sports\n\nIt\u2019s not clear yet how the team will be connected to Shanghai aside from its name, but the expansion does show how the 2K League could differentiate itself from its real-world counterpart and potentially find new audiences in places the NBA can\u2019t reach in the same way. \u201cThis is a historic moment in the NBA 2K League\u2019s journey to becoming a truly global league with fans, franchises, and players from all over the world,\u201d 2K League managing director Brendan Donohue said in a statement.\n\nIt also continues a trend of e-sports leagues attempting to become global, something that\u2019s more challenging in traditional sports given the physical burdens of travel. Most notably, the Overwatch League \u2014 which has teams spread across North America, Europe, and Asia \u2014 will have teams play games based out of their home cities starting next season, as will the upcoming revamped Call of Duty professional circuit. Over its first two seasons, the 2K League hasn\u2019t managed to garner the same scale of audience as its biggest competitors, but a global expansion could potentially help the league grow significantly.\n\n\u201cGen.G\u2019s unique core mission \u2014 to connect e-sports fans and athletes across the US and Asia \u2014 is meant for ambitious ventures like this,\u201d Gen.G CEO Chris Park said in a statement. \u201cWe have big plans to help grow the NBA 2K League in communities around the world that are passionate about basketball and video games.\u201d", "description": "The NBA 2K League is expanding with its first non-NBA e-sports team.
