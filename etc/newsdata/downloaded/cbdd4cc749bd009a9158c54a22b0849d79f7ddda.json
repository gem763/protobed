He said Thursday that the group also had sent letters to other Catholic and Christian colleges including Augustana College, a Lutheran school in Rock Island, Illinois, and Seattle University, urging them to remove references to Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn Tuesday, Students for Life reported that Seattle University \u2014 a Jesuit college in Washington state \u2014 had complied with the group\u2019s request, pulling Planned Parenthood from a website listing \u201cstudent resources.\u201d\n\nMr. Lamb said he anticipates the group intends to target and call out Catholic colleges and universities that hire faculty who support Planned Parenthood, as well.\n\n\u201cOur big thing is that universities should really \u2026 have a code of conduct that their faculty will support the dignity of human life,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe equated anyone working for Planned Parenthood as \u201csomeone who is involved in a sex trafficking organization or the porn industry.\u201d\n\nMr. Lamb said he is not \u201cadvocating for anyone to get fired,\u201d but that a school would say, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t hire someone who work for an organization that supports abortion [because] then you\u2019re complicit in abortion.\u201d\n\nJust over 50% of Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to a 2015 poll from the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nBut the church\u2019s official teaching states that \u201cabortion willed either as an end or a means\u201d is \u201cgravely contrary to the moral law.\u201d\n\nOf the nearly 200 Catholic college and universities in America, few are diocesan schools under direct authority of a bishop.\n\nThe College of Saint Rose, for example, was founded in 1906 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet and describes itself as \u201cprivate, independent, co-educational.\u201d College of Saint Rose\u2019s mission statement does not identify the school as Roman Catholic.\n\n\u201cAn authentic Catholic college would never direct students to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Patrick Reilly, president of The Cardinal Newman Society, a Catholic higher education organization, said in a statement. \u201cSadly, many Catholic colleges today have secularized and are not serious about teaching truth.\u201d\n\nBut the group Catholics for Choice issued a statement opposing that view.\n\n\u201cThis overreaction of the anti-choice group, Students for Life, portrays a profound lack of confidence in their ability to convince the body of students at Catholic universities and colleges to adhere to the group\u2019s ultraconservative position against a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d said Sara Hutchinson Ratcliffe, vice president of Catholics for Choice. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the shameful climate of censorship being promoted is truly anathema to [Cardinal John Henry] Newman\u2019s ideal of what a Catholic university should be.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
