(GPH: TSX-V; GPHOF: OTCQB) (\u201cGraphite One\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces that on October 4, 2019, Alaska Governor Michael J. Dunleavy submitted a letter to the President of the United States requesting that the Company\u2019s Graphite Creek Project and associated advanced materials processing facility (the \u201cProject\u201d) be designated a high-priority infrastructure project (\u201cHPIP\u201d) pursuant to Executive Order 13766 of January 24, 2017.\n\n\n\nThe Graphite Creek deposit, situated about 60 kilometers north of Nome, Alaska, is the largest known natural graphite resource in the United States. The Project is proposed as a vertically integrated enterprise to mine, process and manufacture high grade graphite products primarily for electric vehicle batteries, energy storage systems, and other value-added markets. \u201cGovernor Dunleavy\u2019s High-Priority designation request is a strong signal of the strategic importance of a project like Graphite Creek,\u201d said Anthony Huston, GPH CEO. \u201cJoined with our advanced materials processing facility, our project would provide two links in an advanced graphite supply chain at a time when U.S. graphite production is zero.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Government in December 2017 placed natural graphite on its Critical Minerals List of materials critical to the national economy and national security of the United States. The United States currently has no domestic natural graphite production and is 100% reliant on imports. China produces 70% of the world\u2019s supply.1 According to the authoritative US Geological Survey report, Critical Mineral Resources of the United States (2017): \u201cGraphite is considered a critical and strategic mineral because of its essential applications in the aerospace and energy sectors (such as refractory and foundry applications in the steel and metal industries and use in high-temperature lubricants, high-strength lightweight composite materials, batteries, modern nuclear reactors, fuel cells, electric motors, and evolving electronic applications that anticipate rapid growth in demand for graphite).\u201d2\n\n\u201cDesignating the Graphite Creek Project as a high-priority infrastructure project will send a strong signal that the U.S. intends to end the days of our 100 percent import-dependency for this increasingly critical mineral,\u201d said Governor Dunleavy. The full text of the Governor\u2019s nomination letter is available here.\n\nHigh Priority Infrastructure Projects\n\nThe HPIP program was initiated as a means of expediting, in a manner consistent with law, the approval process for projects designated as high priority for the United States by the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. It was instituted with President Donald J. Trump\u2019s signing on January 24, 2017 of Executive Order 13766 - Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals for High Priority Infrastructure Projects.\n\nAbout Graphite One Inc.\n\nGRAPHITE ONE INC. (GPH: TSX-V; GPHOF: OTCQB) continues to develop its Graphite One Project (the \u201cProject\u201d), whereby the Company could potentially become an American producer of high grade Coated Spherical Graphite (\u201cCSG\u201d) that is integrated with a domestic graphite resource. The Project is proposed as a vertically integrated enterprise to mine, process and manufacture high grade CSG primarily for the lithium-ion electric vehicle battery market. As set forth in the Company\u2019s Preliminary Economic Assessment, potential graphite mineralization mined from the Company\u2019s Graphite Creek Property, is expected to be processed into concentrate at a graphite processing plant. The proposed processing plant would be located on the Graphite Creek Property situated on the Seward Peninsula about 60 kilometers north of Nome, Alaska. CSG and other value-added graphite products, would likely be manufactured from the concentrate at the Company\u2019s proposed graphite product manufacturing facility, the location of which is the subject of further study and analysis. The Company intends to make a production decision on the Project once a feasibility study is completed.\n\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n\n\n\"Anthony Huston\u201d (signed)\n\nFor more information on Graphite One Inc. please visit the Company\u2019s website, www.GraphiteOneInc.com or contact:\n\nAnthony Huston\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nTel: (604) 697-2862\n\nEmail: AHuston@GraphiteOneInc.com\n\nInvestor Relations Contact\n\n1-604-684-6730\n\nGPH@kincommunications.com\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.
