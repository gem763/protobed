Japan's Nikkei added 2.4%.\n\nU.S. stock futures reversed early losses and rose 1%.\n\nThe jumped versus the dollar in offshore trade,\n\nwhile safe-have assets such as gold and the yen fell.\n\nChina's confirmation of trade talks added to upbeat\n\ngeopolitical news overnight. A parliamentary vote in Britain put\n\nthe brakes on the nation's no-deal exit from the European Union,\n\nHong Kong withdrew a contentious extradition bill that sparked\n\nrecent protests and political turmoil in Italy appeared to be\n\neasing.\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry said its trade team will consult\n\nwith their U.S. counterparts in mid-September in preparation for\n\nnegotiations in early October, hinting at progress in reducing\n\ntrade friction. Both sides had agreed to take actual actions to create\n\nfavourable conditions, the ministry added, without giving more\n\ndetails.\n\n\"Since yesterday, there has been limited downside in markets\n\nbecause of what happened in Hong Kong, but now the U.S.-China\n\ntalks are the story,\" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro\n\nstrategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co in Tokyo.\n\n\"It's the same about Brexit, which means less downside\n\nrisk.\"\n\nHong Kong shares erased early losses to rise 0.5%.\n\nThey had jumped in afternoon trade on Wednesday after leader\n\nCarrie Lam said she was withdrawing an extradition bill that had\n\ntriggered months of often violent protests in the Asian\n\nfinancial hub. In currency markets, sterling held onto gains against the\n\ndollar in Asia after rallying the most in more than five months\n\non Wednesday after lawmakers voted to prevent Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson taking Britain out of the European Union without a\n\ndeal on Oct. 31. But, more than three years since the United Kingdom voted\n\nnarrowly to leave the EU, the outcome of Brexit is still\n\nunclear, with possible outcomes ranging from a crash out of the\n\nEU to abandoning the whole endeavour.\n\nAgainst the CNH=D3 , the dollar fell 0.2% to\n\n7.1324 yuan.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields extended gains in Asia and the yield\n\ncurve steepened, both signs that investors were willing to take\n\non riskier assets.\n\nThe 10-year yield rose to 1.4758%, while\n\ntwo-year yields rose to 1.4519%.\n\nThe spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields\n\nUS2US10=TWEB , the most commonly used measure of the yield\n\ncurve, rose to its highest since Aug. 21 on Wednesday but\n\nnarrowed slightly in Asian trade.\n\nThe curve inverted on Aug. 14 for the first time since 2007\n\nwhen long-term yields traded below short-term yields, which is a\n\nwidely accepted indicator of coming recession.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude also reversed\n\nlosses to trade up 0.2%.\n\n(Editing by Sam Holmes & Kim Coghill)", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Confirmation of U.S.-China trade talks buoys shares, investor spirits", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB6208D_L.jpg"}
