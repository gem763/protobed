from July 2009 to October 2010, she worked at the higher education and training department as communications head.\n\nIn 2011, she worked at McCann MSP doing public relations, and returned to journalism, also in 2011, as a sub-editor at the Daily Maverick.\n\nShe joined her current employer, Tiso Blackstar, in 2017.\n\nMunusamy stated that after the tyre incident and speaking to Nzimande, she called an acquaintance, Lieutenant General Raymond Lalla who she knew from covering political violence in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nHe expressed concern and said he would get his colleague, Mphego who she had met while covering the Boeremag stories in 2000, to assist.\n\nMphego called her to say Lalla had spoken to him and she told the story about the deflated tyres again.\n\nMphego said another police officer would assist her.\n\nMunusamy could not remember if this was the same night or the next day.\n\nShe later received a call from a man whose name she does not remember, saying he had been told she was having car trouble, and asked for her address.\n\nHe took her car away, and then returned it.\n\nAll she remembers of him is that he was an Indian male.\n\n\"I will likely be able to confirm this when I see a photograph of him.\"\n\nMunusamy let the man take the car for an inspection and trusted him because she trusted Lalla.\n\n\"To me the vehicle was returned in the exact same condition in which it left,\" she submitted.\n\nALSO READ: 'My vehicle was settled by close family friend,' says Munusamy, who intends to cross-examine witnesses at Zondo commission\n\n\"\u2026 I stress that I was not aware at all that any money had been spent by anyone - much less crime intelligence - to repair anything on my car.\"\n\nOf Mphego, she denied being his confidante or adviser, or anybody's \"confidante\" for that matter.\n\nShe said she was also never provided with an invoice for any of the supposed work done, and her legal team had not yet been able to obtain a copy of this supposed invoice for the work.\n\n\"I value my credibility as a journalist and I am horrified by the allegations that I benefited from being paid by the SSA\".\n\nMunusamy has already denied that crime intelligence paid her car off, saying it was settled by a close family friend, Basheer Ahmed Abdool.", "description": "Journalist Ranjeni Munusamy wants to see the face of the in-camera Zondo commission witness who claimed crime intelligence bought her new tyres, and fixed her car.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9379/5510997164f94d209dbca56b1b2fc445.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
