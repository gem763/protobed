(AP) - His teammates and even his boss have had it with Broncos grabby left tackle Garett Bolles, who suggested officials are unfairly targeting him for holding infractions.\n\nTheir 2017 first-round draft pick was flagged four times for holding in Denver\u2019s 16-14 loss to Chicago on Sunday, giving him 34 yellow flags in 34 starts, 26 of them for grabbing his opponent.\n\nThe laggard left tackle exacerbated his troubles by suggesting afterward that the officials are picking on him.\n\nThe backlash was swift and spirited.\n\nCoach Vic Fangio and star receiver Emmanuel Sanders admonished Bolles to quit grabbing jerseys, putting his hands outside the framework of defenders and finishing plays by tackling his opponent to the ground.\n\nThen, general manager John Elway issued a scathing rebuke of Bolles on his weekly show on KOA NewsRadio.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got to stop. Period,\u201d Elway fumed. \u201cThere are no more excuses for it. He\u2019s had 26 holding penalties in the last two years and two games, so it\u2019s got to stop. The bottom line is if he thinks he\u2019s getting singled out, he is. He\u2019s got to understand that. He\u2019s got to understand what he\u2019s doing.\n\n\u201cAnd that was my question yesterday, \u2018Does he know what holding is?\u2019 Does he know what he can and can\u2019t do? If he thinks he\u2019s getting targeted, he\u2019s got to realize he isn\u2019t. We\u2019ll keep working for it and he\u2019s still a talented guy,\u201d Elway added.\n\n\u201cHe cannot do that because it\u2019s beating us.\u201d\n\nA police officer escorted Bolles off the field after his foursome of penalties Sunday, which promoted wisecrackers on social media to label him the league\u2019s best holder and point out he has more tackles that Von Miller\u2019s four so far.\n\nOne fan posted a photo of the tackle\u2019s No. 72 jersey custom stitched with \u201cHOLDING\u201d across the nameplate in place of \u201cBOLLES.\u201d\n\nBolles, whose infractions have cost the Broncos nearly 450 yards in field position over his career, exacerbated his troubles in the locker room after the game by suggesting he wasn\u2019t getting a fair shake.\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating. I\u2019ve built a reputation for myself in this league of holding. I disagree with it, to be honest,\u201d Bolles said, adding he takes solace in knowing his coaches, including Hall of Famer Mike Munchak, his teammates and the front office all had his back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to turn this around,\u201d Bolles pledged, adding, \u201cThat was just unfortunate that they keep coming after me.\u201d\n\nSuggesting he was the victim prompted Mark Schlereth , Orlando Franklin and Tyler Polumbus , three former Broncos O-linemen who are now broadcasters, to scold Bolles for either an astonishing lack of self-awareness or a disturbing lack of accountability.\n\nNoting that three of his four flags Sunday came on runs, Fangio suggested Bolles needs to be \u201cmore technique-sound. I think he suffers from him thinking he\u2019s in good position sometimes and dumps the guy at the end where he thinks it\u2019s a legal block. We have to do a better job of explaining that to him. He\u2019s got to do a better job of listening to the explaining.\u201d\n\nFangio dismissed the notion of benching Bolles if even for a series to clear his head or make him realize his holding habit could put his job in jeopardy because super sub Elijah Wilkinson is already filling in for injured right tackle Ja\u2019Wuan James.\n\n\u201cWith our depth the way it is at this point, that\u2019s probably not an option,\u201d Fangio said.\n\nRight guard Ronald Leary, who drew two holding calls Sunday - one of which actually appeared to be on Bolles - defended his embattled teammate after the game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re behind him 100 percent. Y\u2019all be trying to crucify him and that ain\u2019t right,\u201d Leary said. \u201cO-line, we\u2019re behind 100 percent. This team is behind him 100 percent.\u201d\n\nSanders suggested any such support must be met with a commitment from Bolles to clean up his game.\n\n\u201cHe needs to understand that he is doing something wrong because they keep throwing the flags on him and he keeps holding,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSchlereth said on 104.3 The Fan in Denver that O-lineman always stick up for one another publicly, but added it\u2019s his experience that differing standards for high draft picks lead to resentment.\n\n\u201cWhat really irritates you is when you\u2019re held to a standard as a player and there\u2019s one guy within that room that\u2019s not held to the same standard because you\u2019re mama-catting him because you\u2019ve got nowhere else to go,\u201d Schlereth said. \u201cThat\u2019s on John Elway (and) that\u2019s on (director of player personnel) Matt Russell because you picked a guy that flat-out can\u2019t play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "His teammates and even his boss have had it with Broncos grabby left tackle Garett Bolles, who suggested officials are unfairly targeting him for holding infractions.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/grabby_garrett_football_16325_c0-68-1631-1018_s1770x1032.jpg?02ac20b5351d91f0044392ffb47288508b74f709", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
