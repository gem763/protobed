When Podolsky's customers flew Delta and booked through Vega Travel, he would enter the fertility center's SkyBonus information, even though the travelers were not employees of the fertility center and didn't have any connection to it, prosecutors said.\n\nProsecutors said that this way Podolsky earned and redeemed more than 42 million SkyBonus points, which the airline valued at $1.75 million.\n\nPodolsky, a dual Ukrainian and American citizen, has been relatively prolific in his role as a travel agent and adviser. In a 2016 profile in Wired, Podolsky said he preferred to think of himself as a \"creative director.\"\n\nPodolsky could not be reached for comment on Friday, and Delta did not immediately return a request for comment.", "description": "Prosecutors say the Delta SkyBonus miles that the man fraudulently earned and redeemed were worth $1.75 million.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ba9812e22af0dce74016b-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
