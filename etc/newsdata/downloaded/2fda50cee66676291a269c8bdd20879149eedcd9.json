The scandal emerged after the private broadcaster Nagorik TV entered a test hall and confronted one of the women posing as Nusrat, in a video that went viral.\n\nNusrat, who was elected to parliament last year, was studying for a bachelor of arts degree with the Bangladesh Open University (BOU).\n\n\u201cWe expelled her because she has committed a crime. A crime is a crime,\u201d said the BOU head, MA Mannan. \u201cWe have cancelled her enrolment. She will never be able to get admitted here again.\u201d\n\nA college official said: \u201cThe proxy students were protected by the MP\u2019s musclemen when they sat for the tests. Everybody knew it but nobody uttered a word because she is from a very influential family.\u201d\n\nNusrat could not be reached for comment.\n\nTest fraud, cheating and leaking of question papers ahead of exams are common in Bangladesh, prompting authorities frequently to cancel results.", "description": "Awami League\u2019s Tamanna Nusrat is accused of paying impersonators in at least 13 tests", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fae54d98f7512eaabd7db40b199285c3730a9ba7/84_0_2213_1328/master/2213.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b47088d71bd1e7857b815e170ee369cc", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
