He did save me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here right now,' she told CNN at an emotional candlelight vigil for the victims on Sunday night.\n\nShe cried as she described how she crawled on the floor trying to escape as 'shots and shots and shots and shots' rang out. She said she looked back at one point and saw Calderon's body.\n\nOnce she made it outside, Trevino called her mother and told her: 'Alfredo's shot. Alfredo's shot.'\n\nShe stayed on the scene cradling Meza until police arrived.\n\n'I just remember holding his face,' she said. 'And I'm pretty sure he still had my lipstick on his cheek when he died, because I remember kissing him on the cheek.'\n\nTrevino says the crime scene is seared into her memory. She sees it every time she closes her eyes.\n\n'I don't feel like I\u2019m ever going to be the same after seeing something like that,' she said.\n\nEverado Meza (pictured) was shot and killed while protecting his friend from gunfire\n\nMeza's friend Celeste Trevino said she held his lifeless body until police arrived. 'He saved me. He did save me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here right now,' she said\n\nA third victim was identified as Francisco Garcia Anaya, known to his friends as 'Stranger'.\n\nAnaya died in his fianc\u00e9e Jessica Rosales' arms as she gave him CPR and tried to hold pressure on his gunshot wound, according to their friend, Shay Celedon.\n\nCeledon said she was at the bar earlier in the night but left two hours before the shooting.\n\n'I go home, go to bed, get woken up two hours later [to learn] that he's deceased, and she held him 'til he took his last breath, and tried to bring him back and keep pressure on his gunshot wound. And it was just one fatal shot that took him from us,' she told CNN.\n\nShe said Anaya and Rosales were in the middle of planning their wedding and hoped to one day have children.\n\n'They were working on their future,' Celedon said. 'He was trying to give her a life she deserved.'\n\nRosales was at Sunday nights' vigil but was too distraught to speak, CNN reported.\n\nOne of Celedon's relatives was shot in the collar bone but is expected to survive.\n\nFrancisco Garcia Anaya (pictured), known to his friends as 'Stranger', was killed in the shooting\n\nA friend said Anaya's fianc\u00e9e Jessica Rosales (above together) gave him CPR and tried to hold pressure on his gunshot wound as he died\n\nDozens of people attended Sunday night's emotional candlelight vigil near Tequila Bar KC\n\nTomasic said all four men killed were Hispanic - but police do not believe the shooting was racially motivated.\n\nDetectives are reviewing surveillance footage and speaking with witnesses to determine what happened inside the bar.\n\n'Even though they were there, everybody has a little bit different story,' Tomasic said.\n\n'We think there was something that happened in the bar earlier probably. Unfortunately, they left and decided to take it to another level, came back and started shooting.\n\n'It's a pretty small bar, so if you have two guys come in and start shooting, people are just running, running anywhere they can.'\n\nBartender Jose Valdez said that he had refused to serve one of the suspects hours before the shooting because the man had previously caused problems at the bar.\n\n'We never, we never serve him,' Valdez told Fox4. 'We try to keep people like that out of the bar. Right then and there, he picked up a cup that was right there and threw it at me.'\n\nValdez said he kicked the man out after that incident around 11pm, noting that a security guard was supposed to be manning the door but did not show up for work Saturday night.\n\nThe suspect got into a fight in the parking lot before leaving, according to multiple witnesses. He then returned half an hour before closing time with another man.\n\n'When he came in the second time he did not say nothing. He walked in and looked for who he was looking for, and just started shooting,' Valdez said.\n\nThe bartender said the gunfire filled the bar with smoke and he feared the building was 'going to cave in'.\n\n'I don't know what to make of it. A sad day for everybody who lost their lives and their families,' Valdez told the KC Star as he choked back tears.\n\n'How can you go into a place full of people and just start shooting?'\n\nBartender Jose Valdez told the KC Star that he had refused to serve one of the suspects hours before the shooting because the man had previously caused problems at the bar\n\nGunfire erupted inside the small bar at 1.30am Sunday, sending 40 or so patrons running for the exits. Officers arrived on the scene within minutes and found four men dead\n\nMichael Barajas Jr, 31, was also at Tequila KC when the shooting occurred.\n\n'They went off so quick I didn't think it was gunshots,' Barajas Jr told the KC Star.\n\nHe was looking around the room trying to see where the bullets were coming from when one hit him in the shoulder blade.\n\n'I feel like I should have moved a little quicker but there was shock,' he said.\n\nBarajas Jr ran out of the bar and texted his fianc\u00e9e: 'I've been shot' before watching police rope off the scene.\n\nHe and four others injured patrons were taken to the hospital in stable condition.\n\nAt least two of them have since been released.\n\nMichael Barajas Jr (right) was shot in the shoulder blade. He was one of five people injured\n\nThe owner of Tequila Bar KC said a security guard was supposed to be manning the door but did not show up for work Saturday night\n\nSeveral people at the scene Sunday morning described the bar as a beloved local hot spot\n\nLoved ones gathered near the bar Sunday morning, clinging to each other and crying as firefighters hosed blood off the pavement.\n\nToni Maciel, 36, told the KC Star she knew seven of the nine people shot.\n\nShe echoed Valdez' account, saying that one of the shooters had gotten into an altercation at the bar beforehand.\n\n'He left because they kind of kicked him out, but he wouldn't leave. He was persistent,' Maciel said.\n\n'It took about four people to kick him out. After that, maybe an hour or two later, he came back and this happened. He wasn't by himself. He had somebody else with him.'\n\nToni Maciel (left) and Shay Celedon (right) were at the bar on the night of the shooting and both knew several of the victims\n\nMaciel said that she knows the wife of one of the alleged shooters. She claimed that he had been violent toward his wife during a karaoke event last Thursday.\n\nShe said she hopes the gunmen are apprehended soon.\n\n'These people don't know what they did,' Maciel said. 'They took a brother, a dad, a son, somebody. It's not right.'\n\nCeledon, whose friend Anaya was killed, said she witnessed one of the two suspected shooters get in a fight when she was at the bar earlier in the night.\n\nShe said the man was yelling and appeared intoxicated. Celedon said she left roughly two hours before the shooting because she had a 'bad vibe' after watching the fight.\n\nTina Stapleton, a regular at the bar, was shocked when she saw the photos police released of the suspects.\n\nShe said she had spoken to at least one of the suspects at the bar and that he asked her for a cigarette.\n\nStapleton left about an hour before the shots rang out because something told her to go home, she told the KC Star.\n\n'It blows my mind,' she said. 'I just couldn't believe it.'\n\nSeveral people gathered near the scene Sunday morning as police conducted an investigation\n\nA coroner is seen loading one of the bodies into a white van outside the bar\n\nSeveral people at the scene Sunday morning described Tequila KC as a beloved local hot spot.\n\n'This was a home away from home, you could say,' Maciel said. 'But after this, I don\u2019t know what would happen with our community.'\n\nValdez said three of the people killed were regulars whose parents also frequented the bar, while the fourth victim was there for the first time.\n\n'We lost some good people, young people,' Valdez said.\n\nTomasic said Tequila KC is a private, members-only venue, but the owner told local media that it became public after changing its name a while back.\n\nThe bar is located in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in southwest Kansas City.\n\nTequila KC (pictured) is located in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in southwest Kansas City\n\nPosted on the door of the bar near 10th Street and Central Avenue is a sign banning firearms\n\nKansas City Mayor David Alvey briefly addressed the media near the scene on Sunday morning.\n\n'It's a sad day for all those involved,' Alvey said.\n\n'The businesses and the families who live in these neighborhoods are growing in our community and they deserve to feel safe in their neighborhoods.\n\n'Their businesses deserve to be protected and our police department really has done an outstanding job of working with the community to identify the problems and to come up with solutions.'\n\nKansas Gov Laura Kelly tweeted: 'My thoughts are with the victims and their families and friends after a mass shooting early this morning in a Kansas City, Kan., bar tragically left four people dead and five more wounded. We are closely monitoring the situation with the help of local law enforcement.'\n\nRep Sharice Davids, a Democrat who represents the area where the shooting took place, tweeted that her 'heart breaks for everyone impacted'.\n\nNews of the shooting - which is the 324th so far this year, according to Gun Violence Archive - was met with countless calls for gun reform on social media.\n\nKnow any of victims of this shooting?
