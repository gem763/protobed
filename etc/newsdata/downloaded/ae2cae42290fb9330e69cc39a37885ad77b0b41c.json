While it will likely take a long time for the suit to shake out, the filing alone is yet another sign that the Trump administration is hellbent on stalling any climate action.\n\n\u201cMy initial reaction [to the case]: it\u2019s appalling that instead of suing polluters, the Trump administration is suing those trying to stop pollution,\u201d Michael Gerrard, the director of Columbia\u2019s Sabin Centre for Climate Change Law, told Gizmodo in an email. \u201cThe least they could do is get out of the way.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the case, which was filed on Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for Eastern California. The complaint centres around California\u2019s participation in the Western Climate Initiative, an agreement with Quebec for a unified carbon market that\u2019s overseen by a nonprofit (two other Canadian provinces are also partners, but aren\u2019t part of the emissions market).\n\nThe mechanism they\u2019ve chosen to do that is setting up a market where companies can buy permits to emit carbon. The number of permits constricts each year, which means companies need to innovate to pollute less or pay more for the remaining permits. It\u2019s a standard market idea that conservatives, in theory, should love, but because it involves climate action, the initiative has received some pushback.\n\nThat includes a state court case with the California Chamber of Commerce arguing the cap-and-trade agreement was unlawful. In April 2017, a lower court ruled that it was, in fact, lawful, and the state Supreme Court refused to take the case up. Arguments about the constitutionality of the international carbon market have also arisen in the past, though UCLA law professor Jonathan Zasloff wrote in a 2010 overview in Legal Planet that he was \u201ca little sceptical\u201d that a court would buy into them.\n\nThe Trump administration is now pushing the hardest against it. The DOJ\u2019s case alleges that California overreached by including Quebec in the trading scheme. The federal government argues that the effort is an \u201cindependent foreign policy\u201d that undermines the U.S.\n\n\u201cAllowing individual states in the Union to conduct their own foreign policy to advance their own narrow interests is thus anathema to our system of government and, if tolerated, would unlawfully enhance state power at the expense of the United States and undermine the United States\u2019 ability to negotiate competitive international agreements,\u201d DOJ lawyers wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s rich coming from the Trump administration for a variety of reasons. First, Trump told governors shortly after his inauguration he was committed to \u201cmake states the laboratories of democracy once again... The government should not stand in your way in delivering needed reforms and services \u2014 and it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhat a nice sentiment. Except, it turns out, it\u2019s completely untrue for the states that want to act on climate. Trump has attacked California repeatedly for everything from linking the huge wildfires that have ravaged the state to climate change to how it regulates vehicle emissions. Now add the carbon market to another attack brought about by the faux states\u2019 right brigade.\n\nThen there\u2019s this idea that climate change is somehow a \u201cnarrow\u201d interest, an idea that is patently absurd. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance. California\u2019s carbon market is a drop in the bucket of the ambition that\u2019s needed to address climate change. Yet the Trump administration has set the U.S. on a course to completely drop the ball.\n\nThat includes rolling back numerous regulations to curb greenhouse gas emissions, opening the Arctic and other areas for fossil fuel exploration, laughably calling natural gas \u201cfreedom gas,\u201d and announcing that the U.S. would be leaving the Paris Agreement.\n\nJeffrey Clark, the assistant attorney general of the Environment and Natural Resources Division, told the Wall Street Journal this wasn\u2019t political, and that he\u2019s been thinking about this since the market started in 2007. But it says a lot about the priorities of the Trump administration compared to his predecessors that the case is only coming about 12 years later.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom blasted the suit in a statement, calling it part of a \u201cpolitical vendetta against California, our climate policies and the health of our communities. Carbon pollution knows no borders, and the Trump administration\u2019s abysmal record of denying climate change and propping up big polluters makes cross-border collaboration all the more necessary.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration continued its twin, often intertwined wars against California and the climate on Wednesday, suing the state for participating in a program to reduce its carbon pollution....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Alex Choros"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/kysaw2xqvksrvvr9pvey.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
