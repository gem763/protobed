Both it and Alcatel's two new phones run on KaiOS, enabling some popular apps. However, unlike the Nokia Flip, Alcatel's flip phones will be available in the US.\n\nThe Go Flip 3 is available through Metro by T-Mobile and T-Mobile, while the Smartflip will be offered by AT&T and Cricket Wireless.\n\nThe Alcatel pair are basic phones featuring a physical keyboard, a 2.8-inch main display and a 1.44-inch display on the front that shows who's calling.\n\nTLC uses the same image for both phones, so presumably they are the same but have different names, depending on the carrier.\n\nGiven that the phones lack a soft keyboard like smartphones, texting from the keypad could be cumbersome. However, TCL highlights that Google Assistant can help speed up tasks like making a call, dictating texts, opening apps, and searching for directions.\n\nThe devices come with 4GB of storage with the option to add a 32GB microSD card for extra space.\n\nKaiOS is now running on over a dozen smart feature phones, including Alcatel's existing Go Flip 2, which gained access to WhatsApp earlier this year.\n\nKaiOS Technologies, which has financial backing from Google, says it has shipped 100 million devices to around 100 countries.\n\nThe Smartflip is compatible with AT&T's public safety network FirstNet, meaning responders and public safety officers can use the device to stay connected.\n\nTCL notes that Go Flip 3 supports T-Mobile's Mobile Hotspot, so users can share its 4G data connection with up to eight other devices.\n\nTCL hasn't disclosed pricing yet, but the devices will be available at T-Mobile and Metro stores in September and October, respectively. The Smartflip will be available at AT&T and Cricket Wireless in September, too.", "description": "Google Assistant could take the hassle out of texting on the two new basic flip phones from TCL.", "authors": ["Liam Tung"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/e3c77052-22f3-4a49-827a-4042338d5705/thumbnail/770x578/b88c0d8579ab2a5f00e922305e776201/alcatelgo-flip-3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
