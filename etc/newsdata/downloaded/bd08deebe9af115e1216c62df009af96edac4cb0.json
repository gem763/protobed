Kurdish militias working with the US against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) are considered by Ankara to be terrorist organizations, and the operation was aimed at pushing them back 30 km away from the border.\n\nAlso on rt.com 'Do people really think we should go to war with NATO member Turkey?'
