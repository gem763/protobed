(Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSecurity researchers at Google uncovered a \u201csustained\u201d \u2014 at least two years \u2014 and indiscriminate campaign to hack iPhones through certain websites, allowing attackers to steal messages, files and track location data every 60 seconds.\n\nIn a deep-dive blog post published Thursday evening, Ian Beer, a security expert on Google\u2019s Project Zero, detailed how hackers had been using malicious websites to exploit an iPhone software vulnerability. The post did not name the websites nor say how many people were affected.\n\n\u201cThere was no target discrimination; simply visiting the hacked site was enough for the exploit server to attack your device, and if it was successful, install a monitoring implant,\u201d Beer wrote. \u201cWe estimate that these sites receive thousands of visitors per week. \u201d\n\nThe implant also collected password keychains, messages, address books and other personal information from users\u2019 apps, including WhatsApp, Telegram and Gmail.\n\nThis type of widespread yet random attack is rare, and it may be one of the biggest attacks ever on iPhone users. But there was a limit to the malware\u2019s power \u2014 it was erased if the iPhone was restarted, freeing the user unless they returned to one of the malicious websites.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post.\n\nAs Google\u2019s external security team, Project Zero researchers are dispatched to find all manner of weaknesses in popular technology. Since it was created in July 2014, the team has found and reported nearly 1,600 hardware and software vulnerabilities. But Project Zero has taken heat for its tough tactics: After reporting a bug, the team gives the vendor 90 days to fix it before Project Zero discloses the details publicly. (In some cases, Google will offer an additional 14-day grace period.)\n\nGoogle contends that the hard deadline produces the best results. Earlier this month, Project Zero said that about 95.8 percent of the bugs it finds and reports are patched before the 90-day deadline.\n\nBut when Project Zero informed Apple of the breach on Feb. 1, it gave the company seven days to fix it, citing the need for urgency. The iPhone maker released iOS 12.1.4 on Feb. 7.\n\nCVE-2019-7286 and CVE-2019-7287 in the iOS advisory today (https://t.co/ZsIy8nxLvU) were exploited in the wild as 0day. \u2014 Ben Hawkes (@benhawkes) February 7, 2019\n\nApple is notoriously guarded with its products, shielding them from even well-meaning hackers looking to probe iOS vulnerabilities. But the company gradually opened its products up to researchers, and it recently announced plans to release a hacker-friendly phone to certain experts in the interest of uncovering vulnerabilities more quickly.\n\nAt the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, Apple\u2019s head of security engineering said the company will pay as much as $1.5 million for a \u201cbug bounty\u201d to any researcher who discovers iOS attack techniques and discreetly reports them to Apple.\n\nIn the blog post, Beer wrote that he didn\u2019t want to try to put a price tag on the attacks but said that \u201c$1 million, $2 million, or $20 million\u201d seemed low, given the attackers\u2019 ability to \u201cmonitor the private activities of entire populations in real time.\u201d\n\nAnd while this operation ultimately failed as it was discovered by Project Zero, Beer made it clear that there are almost certainly hackers more lurking and preying on people.\n\n\u201cAll that users can do is be conscious of the fact that mass exploitation still exists and behave accordingly; treating their mobile devices as both integral to their modern lives, yet also as devices which when compromised, can upload their every action into a database to potentially be used against them.\u201d\n\nDig Deeper: Personal tech + Privacy\n\nWant to learn about how to keep your personal information private?
