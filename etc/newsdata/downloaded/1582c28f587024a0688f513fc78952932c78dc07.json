It involves frozen feet, an old helmet, a hot air balloon and the most productive wide receiver in the league.\n\nAnd now, on the eve of the new season, the player at the center of this summer-long saga\u2014the Oakland Raiders\u2019 Antonio Brown\u2014reportedly may be suspended before ever playing a game for the team.\n\nThe drastic measure comes after Brown capped a crazy pre-season with an unexpected coda. After missing some of training camp because of a grisly-looking injury and then a dispute over which helmet he could wear this season, Brown this week publicly vented his displeasure with a letter he received from the team enumerating fines he accrued for missing team activities as his bizarre soap opera played out. A day later, according to ESPN, he got into a confrontation with the team\u2019s brass.\n\n\u201cAntonio Brown\u2019s not in the building today. He won\u2019t be practicing,\u201d Raiders general manager Mike Mayock said in brief remarks Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more information for you right now.\u201d\n\nFirst, a brief recap: Brown has been arguably the best receiver in football for years now. In his last six seasons with Pittsburgh, nobody in the NFL had more receiving yards. But when he was unhappy with the Steelers, they shipped him to Oakland. Raiders coach Jon Gruden hoped he could become the key piece in revitalizing an offense that looked woeful last year.\n\nBrown got a rich new contract, the Raiders got their playmaker and everybody was happy.\n\nBriefly.\n\n\u201cI expect a lot more drama from number 84,\u201d Gruden said about Brown in July. \u201cI really do.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s offseason initially looked like a happy-go-lucky affair. He gallivanted across the globe, holding viral workouts in Paris and Hawaii, sometimes with complete strangers. He arrived at the Raiders\u2019 Napa, Calif. training camp by hot air balloon.\n\nBut there was a problem, and it had nothing to do with the unorthodox transportation he took into camp. The bottoms of his feet were quite gnarly. And more disturbingly, the entire world could see those feet because he posted pictures of them on social media. His feet were also on display because the Raiders are the featured team on this season\u2019s version of HBO\u2019s \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sure you want to see it?\u201d Brown asked the cameraman in one clip, before comparing his peeling feet to a circumcision. The injury was due to a cryotherapy mishap over the off-season, Brown said on the show, producing pain, swelling and peeling.\n\nThat cleared up, but things continued sliding downhill from when Brown learned he would no longer be allowed to use his preferred helmet because it did not pass health and safety standards agreed upon by the NFL and NFL Players Association. He filed two grievances over the issue, lost both, and missed time with the team while he stewed over the kerfuffle.\n\nThen, on Wednesday, Brown posted a letter on Instagram that he received from the team saying he was fined more than $50,000 for unexcused absences. \u201cWhen your own team want to hate but there\u2019s no stopping me now,\u201d he wrote in part of the caption. That post reportedly led to a confrontation, resulting in the potential suspension.\n\nThe Raiders went 4-12 last season, Gruden\u2019s first since returning to the team where he started his coaching career. It had been nearly a decade since Gruden had last coached with the Buccaneers, who he once led to a Super Bowl win, but he was wooed back with a lucrative contract and the chance to restore the Raiders\u2019 glory days.\n\nBrown became a key part of that vision. Now his future with the Raiders is murky with the team quickly discovering why it cost so little to acquire him--just a couple mid-round draft picks.\n\nAt the very least, the Raiders are back to being the center of attention--whether that\u2019s a good thing or not.\n\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "description": "The Oakland Raiders\u2019 Antonio Brown reportedly may be suspended before ever playing a game for the team.", "authors": ["Andrew Beaton", "Andrew.Beaton Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104332/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
