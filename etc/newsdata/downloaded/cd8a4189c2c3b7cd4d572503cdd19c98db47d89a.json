Two days earlier, China\u2019s Caixin manufacturing survey reported a second month of modest improvement. The two surveys show that China is suffering less from the effects of the trade war than the United States, quite the opposite of what President Donald Trump has insisted during the past year. I have been warning this would happen for more than a year.\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nEquity markets fell sharply on the news, with cyclical sectors like oil, transportation and industrials losing the most.\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nIn a September 30 tweet, President Trump blamed the \u201cpathetic\u201d Federal Reserve for failing to cut interest rates sufficiently to reduce the value of the US dollar. The Federal Reserve governors \u201chave allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected.\u201d Trump added, \u201cThey are their own worst enemies, they don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\n\nThe president isn\u2019t fooling anyone, least of all the stock market.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how Trump concluded that the Fed is responsible for the present industrial recession. Perhaps someone on his staff showed him a chart that looks like this:\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nThe NAPM survey for export orders fell to just 41, the worst result since the depths of the 2009 Great Recession, while the dollar rose. Of course, the US dollar index stood at 100 in October 2016 when the NAPM export orders index climbed to 60. But one might infer a trade-off.\n\nThe trouble with this sort of thinking is that the export orders of all the world\u2019s countries have fallen, whether or not their currencies have risen or fallen. Germany\u2019s export orders have collapsed, leaving Europe\u2019s largest economy on the verge of recession, despite the weakness of the euro.\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nThe problem is that the overall volume of world trade has shrunk, and the volume of export orders for every major trading economy has shrunk even more. Even if President Trump moved quickly to a trade deal with China, which seems unlikely, the after-effects of uncertainty will depress economic activity for some months to come. His ill-conceived China policy endangers his chances of re-election in 2020.\n\nClick here to view the chart.\n\nExport orders from Germany and Japan, two of the three largest trading economies, have fallen by 8% in the past three months. The pie is shrinking, and it will not help the United States to reduce the value of the dollar.\n\nWhere US domestic lending is concerned, it is fanciful to argue that a lower overnight rate from the Federal Reserve will do much for businesses or consumers. The cost of long-term borrowing for US corporations rated Baa is only 3.91%, the lowest since 1956. Meanwhile the assessed interest rates on credit cards stands at 17%, the highest in history. Credit card interest rates have climbed despite the steady decline in the business borrowing rate. Banks are using the high rate to ration credit to consumers. The overnight rate has nothing to do with the matter.\n\nCorporations meanwhile have taken advantage of historically low borrowing costs to increase their debt. But the present corporate borrowing boom has had little economic impact. As I reported in this space July 24 (\u201cA Storm Warning for the Stock Market\u201d), US corporations now give more money back to their shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks than their total operating earnings. That has helped buoy equity prices while capital investment has shrunk. Reducing interest rates might encourage more of this sort of balance-sheet padding, but it won\u2019t benefit the economy.\n\nThe dark cloud hanging over the US economy (and the economies of the rest of the world) is the trade war, which has frozen capital investment while corporations try to work out whether they will face punitive taxes if they put their supply chains in the wrong place.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Asia Times.", "description": "Collapsing US export orders dragged down the widely-followed National Association .10/04/2019 12:53:30PM EST.", "authors": ["David P.
