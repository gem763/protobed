Dudley was drafted in to the top job in 2010 in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and spilled an estimated 507m litres of oil.\n\nHe replaced gaffe-prone Tony Hayward, who famously said he wanted his 'life back' following the hectic period that followed the catastrophe. The disaster cost BP \u00a3311m in the most recent quarter, almost a decade later, while the total bill is more than \u00a350 billion.\n\nDudley has notched up pay of more than \u00a396m during his time and is in line to get as much as \u00a341m from share awards in future if BP hits certain targets, according to the current share price.\n\nOil prices slumped to an average of $62 a barrel in the third quarter of 2019. BP was also hit by maintenance costs at some of its most profitable fields and the effect of Hurricane Barry, which shut facilities in the Gulf of Mexico for around a fortnight and dealt a 'significant' blow to production in July.\n\nOverall, oil and gas production fell 2.5 per cent when stripping out BP's stake in Russian group Rosneft.\n\nIt expects fourth-quarter production will improve as maintenance works wind down. Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said: 'In a challenging quarter for energy, BP's results are remarkably resilient.'\n\nRuss Mould, at AJ Bell, said: 'The numbers are an advert for the benefits of being a big diversified operation \u2013 the arm which refines oil into end products like jet fuel and petrol has had a strong quarter.'\n\nAlthough BP was in the black by the energy industry's preferred measure of profits, its net profit plunged into the red, reaching a \u00a3544m loss. This was due to a \u00a32bn one-off tax charge linked to asset sales \u2013 though it had warned a charge was coming.\n\nBP announced a dividend of 10.25 US cents for the quarter and has removed the option for a scrip dividend. This gave investors the choice of receiving shares instead of cash. But analysts raised concerns about debt, especially following its purchase of US shale assets from BHP last year for \u00a38.3 billion.\n\nIt has sold other assets, such as its Alaska operations for \u00a34.3 billion, to free up more cash.\n\nBut debt rose 21 per cent in the most recent quarter, above the company's target level. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'Debt levels still remain too high relative to the industry average. Management has assured that they should be much lower by the end of 2020.\n\n'All being well, \u00a37.8 billion worth of divestments should be in place in the next 12 months bringing overall debt down from \u00a336 billion.'\n\nDudley said: 'Our focus remains firmly on maintaining financial discipline and delivering safe and reliable operations.'
