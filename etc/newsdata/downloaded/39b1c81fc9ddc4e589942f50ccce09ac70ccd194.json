Goulard\u2019s rejection was criticized by Macron.\n\nThe spat over Goulard\u2019s rejection could potentially delay the start of the new Commission, which is due to take office on Nov. 1, and curb the influence of France, the European Union\u2019s second biggest economy and a founding member of the club.", "description": "French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Monday that he was not a candidate to replace Sylvie Goulard as French president Emmanuel Macron's choice for European Commissioner.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440628506&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0I3", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
