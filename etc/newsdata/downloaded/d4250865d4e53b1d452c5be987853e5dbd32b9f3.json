REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\n\nIn its 72-page Financial Stability Review, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said a succession of interest rate cuts and some easing of lending rules may have helped rekindle demand for the country\u2019s housing market.\n\nAustralia\u2019s A$1.95 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy has grown for 28 years without a recession, but risks have intensified in the past year, with growth slowing, inflation lukewarm, the property market subdued and unemployment ticking higher.\n\nBack-to-back rate cuts in June and July saw capital city house price declines slow, although other parts of the economy including approvals to build new homes remain subdued.\n\nThe RBA cut rates for the third time this year on Tuesday and financial market pricing implies a 50-50 chance of a fourth move as soon as next month.\n\nThe RBA is concerned about the housing sector as it accounts for 40% to 50% of household and bank assets.\n\n\u201cIn the near term, risks from falls in housing prices have reduced but still exist,\u201d the central bank said in its report on Friday.\n\n\u201cIncreased uncertainty regarding the global and domestic macroeconomic outlook increases the risks faced by households,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cOverall, households remain well placed to service their debt: the most indebted households are those with the highest incomes, and many have sizeable prepayments.\u201d\n\nHouse prices in the biggest cities Sydney and Melbourne had picked up in recent months and the RBA said \u201cthere are tentative signs that turnover may be near its trough\u201d.\n\nHowever, home building activity was unlikely to revive soon. This week government data showed approvals to build new homes collapsed in September to the lowest since 2013.\n\nAustralia\u2019s household debt-to-income ratio is at a record high of about 190 percent, making mortgage holders vulnerable to higher interest rates or loss of employment.\n\nThe RBA said most households were comfortably making mortgage payments but a rise in non-performing housing loans - to the highest level since before the global financial crisis - was notable.\n\n\u201cRising unemployment or ongoing weakness in income growth would likely see an increasing share of households struggle to make their debt repayments,\u201d it said.\n\nThe central bank said uncertainty about the global economy had increased in the past six months as a result of the US-China trade war, while escalating tension in Hong Kong, the Middle East and Britain\u2019s planned exit from the European Union may put further pressure on global growth.\n\nWhile Australia was resilient to global economic shocks, an overly risk-averse approach by the country\u2019s banks since a misconduct inquiry exposed widespread misconduct may add further downward pressure to the economy.\n\n\u201cIt is important that banks are not overly cautious in the implementation of current lending policies,\u201d the RBA said.\n\n\u201cExcessive risk aversion by financial institutions can curtail the provision of credit that facilitates economic growth.\u201d", "description": "Australia\u2019s central bank warned on Friday the country\u2019s housing market was a \u201ckey source of potential systemic risk\u201d even as tentative signs of a turnaround in the property sector emerge.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436855725&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9302L", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
