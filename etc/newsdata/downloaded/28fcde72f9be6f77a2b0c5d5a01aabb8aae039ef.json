Here's what you need to know as you start the day ...\n\nExclusive: Whistleblower wrote memo after learning of Ukraine call, saying White Huse official called it 'frightening'\n\nImmediately after learning second-hand information from a White House official about President Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine, the first whistleblower wrote a dramatic personal memo, saying the White House official characterized the call as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cfrightening,\u201d Fox News has learned. In the two-page, single-spaced memo on July 26, the day after the Trump-Zelensky phone call, the whistleblower wrote that the conversation with the unnamed White House official \u201conly lasted a few minutes, and as a result, I only received highlights.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to a publicly released transcript of the July 25 phone call, the two-page memo used dramatic language. According to the memo, the White House official \u201cdescribed the (July 25th) call as \u2018crazy,\u2019 \u2018frightening,\u2019 and \u2018completely lacking in substance related to national security.\u2019\u201d Click here for more on our top story.\n\nIn other developments in the formal Trump impeachment inquiry: The emergence of the whistleblower's memo came as sources told Fox News that Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, in testimony to House lawmakers, could not explain what accounted for the 18-day window between the July 25 call and the whistleblower's Aug. 12 complaint filing \u2014 or when exactly the whistleblower contacted a key Democrat's staff. According to the Washington Post, House Democrats are considering steps to keep the whistleblower's identity from their Republican colleagues in order to prevent a loyalist to President Trump from leaking the whistleblower's identity to the public.\n\nIn addition, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., all issued subpoenas Monday to the Pentagon and the White House Office of Management and Budget for documents related to Trump's call.

On his show Monday, Tucker Carlson discussed a transcript of a call between former President Bill Clinton and then-U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair -- the same year as the election pitting Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, against George W. Bush -- during which the ex-president asked his British counterpart for a political favor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard endlessly on cable news that it is unprecedented the president would seek political gain from a conversation with a foreign leader. Well, turns out, it has happened before,\u201d Carlson said.

In his first public comments since news broke early Monday of the troop withdrawal, Trump said he understood the concerns raised by his fellow Republicans, but added that it was time to fulfill his campaign promise to bring the troops home.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers, who have stood lockstep with the president on almost every other issue, have expressed concern that the withdrawal could lead to the genocide of the U.S.\u2019s Kurdish allies and a return to power of the Islamic State in the region. Nikki Haley, former U.S. ambassador to the UN, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming were just a few of the prominent Republicans who voiced opposition to the president's decision.\n\nHong Kong stock exchange drops bid to buy London exchange\n\nThe Hong Kong stock exchange officially dropped its takeover bid for its London counterpart on Tuesday.
