Queensland coal exports have been strong in 2019, with a record 21.4 million tonnes exported in June.\n\nIncluding coal haulage volumes in NSW, which rose 14 per cent to 16.2 million tonnes in the September quarter compared with a year earlier because of a new MACH Energy contract, Aurizon's overall coal haulage volumes climbed 1 per cent.\n\nBulk haulage volumes, which include iron ore, also rose 1 per cent to 11.6 million tonnes.", "description": "The rail group blamed production constraints for a 4 per cent fall in the September quarter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5569%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_54%2C$y_14/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/66092b1a686bb93e45314aedd4c4fc67dabb9dc3", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
