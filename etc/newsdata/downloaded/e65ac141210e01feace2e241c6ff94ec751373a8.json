Mnuchin said the latest deficit numbers show Washington must do better.\n\n\u201cIn order to truly put America on a sustainable financial path, we must enact proposals\u2014like the president\u2019s 2020 budget plan\u2014to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president\u2019s current budget proposal wouldn\u2019t balance the federal budget within a decade, much less address the national debt that has climbed to more than $22 trillion.\n\nMr. Mnuchin and Office of Management and Budget acting Director Russ Vought emphasized the strong economy in their statements on the deficit.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s economic agenda is working: the nation is experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years, there are more jobs to fill than there are job seekers, and Americans are experiencing sustained year-over-year wage increases,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.\n\nMr. Vought said the president\u2019s budget includes \u201cmore deficit reduction than any administration in history\u2014saving $2.8 trillion over 10 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans from all walks of life are flourishing again thanks to pro-growth policies enacted by this administration,\u201d Mr. Vought said. \u201cBy providing a responsible fiscal path forward and pursuing pro-growth reforms, President Trump\u2019s agenda will make America\u2019s economic expansion enduring.\n\nThe fiscal 2019 deficit was $107 billion less than the estimate of $1.092 trillion in the fiscal 2020 budget, the officials said, and $16 billion less than the estimate published in July.\n\nMitch Daniels, co-chair of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the nation\u2019s finances are \u201cat a turning point.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur nation\u2019s leaders are in debt denial, running up red ink all while ignoring trillions of dollars in shortfalls for Social Security, Medicare, and other programs that many millions of Americans rely upon,\u201d said Mr. Daniels, former head of OMB under President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cWithout action now to phase in reforms over the coming years, Americans will face a much different future than the one that was promised. We can\u2019t wait for another year or another Congress or another president to tackle these challenges.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
