The drug, Palforzia, still needs final approval from the FDA, but it is already offering hope to patients like Danielle Tryon.\n\nShe's had multiple food allergies, including peanuts, since she was a toddler. From early on, she learned the fine art of avoiding exposure.\n\n\"Even just being in rooms, anytime that I smelled peanut butter, I would be hyper-alert. It's something that can kill you,\" Danielle said.\n\nShe has also used adrenaline four times to counter life-threatening reactions. \"It was hard, it was really hard,\" said her mother, Nancy Tryon.\n\nIn 2016, Danielle enrolled in a trial for a new treatment. Patients swallow a trace amount of peanut protein and gradually scale up.\n\n\"You slowly make your body get used to it over time,\" said Dr. Jonathan Spergel, who helped run the trial at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nIn patients aged 4 to 17, two-thirds taking the drug were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts. But nearly 12% withdrew because of allergic reactions or side effects like stomach problems.\n\n\"It means cross-contamination is not such a big issue. You can't go home and have a peanut butter sandwich, but you should be able to walk out with less fear,\" Spergel said.\n\nThe treatment has already given Danielle, now 17, a taste of her new freedom, like a trip to an ice cream shop for the first time and imagining life in a college dorm. \"I could not even believe that's down the line now,\" Danielle said.\n\n\"She's got her wings she might as well go off and fly,\" Nancy said.\n\nThe oral therapy is not a cure. The drug would still need to be used daily and over the long term as 80% of children with peanut allergy stay allergic. It's meant to prevent severe reactions to accidental exposure versus taking medication afterward.", "description": "The treatment is designed to \"trick\" a patient's immune system", "authors": ["Jonathan Lapook"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/02/21/5674b88a-4f76-4413-830b-d033f038a57a/thumbnail/1200x630/f7d200b3b912bcbdf1387bf5b11217ee/ctm-0221-peanut-allergies.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
