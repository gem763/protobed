Earlier this season, Andreescu was sidelined for months with a right shoulder issue and in August was hampered by a groin injury at the Rogers Cup.\n\n\"I really don't want to blame my back, but I felt like I didn't have the same power [in the third set] as I did in the first and second set,\" she said. \"But I fought well with what I had in the third. I'm proud of that. Still, pretty disappointed.\"\n\nMaybe I'll get to play her again here, get my revenge. \u2014 Canada's Bianca Andreescu on 2019 Wimbledon champion Simona Halep\n\nAndreescu, coming off a quarter-final defeat to Osaka at the China Open in Beijing, has now lost two matches in a row in the aftermath of a 17-match winning streak. It marks the first time she has lost two in a row since July-August 2018.\n\nIt was the first career meeting for Andreescu against a player she grew up cheering for as a youngster. Andreescu's family comes from Romania and the teenager spent some of her childhood in the country.\n\nThe match also featured the past two Grand Slam champions \u2014 Halep won Wimbledon and Andreescu captured the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I didn't feel intimidated at all stepping on the court,\" Andreescu said. \"I know I looked up to her a lot, so being able to play her was really fun.

Halep asked for multiple visits from her coach, Darren Cahill, while Andreescu did not request any chats with her coach, Sylvain Bruneau.\n\nAndreescu is the first Canadian to play in the WTA Finals since Eugenie Bouchard went 0-3 at the event in 2014.\n\nHer current ranking is the best ever by a Canadian woman and she has a chance to top the No. 3 ranking Milos Raonic achieved on the men's tour.\n\nSvitolina extends WTA Finals run\n\nSvitolina, the defending champion, stretched her unbeaten run at the WTA Finals into a new year, beating Pliskova 7-6 (12), 6-4 in her opening match Monday.\n\nSvitolina, the only player in this year's field who has not won a title this season, was unbeaten in the tournament last year.\n\nAfter exchanging service breaks in the first set, Svitolina converted her seventh set point.
