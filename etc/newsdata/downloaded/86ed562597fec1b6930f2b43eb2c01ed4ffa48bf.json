They arrived home Friday for the District\u2019s first World Series game in 86 years, up 2-0 in the series. Two days later, they\u2019re still looking for the first Fall Classic win at home in those same 86 years.\n\nSo what\u2019s left is this: a best-of-three series, with Sunday night\u2019s Game 5 the last at Nationals Park before at least one more and potentially two in Houston.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tied after four games,\u201d Washington shortstop Trea Turner said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about perspective and how you perceive it.\u201d\n\nHow\u2019s your glass this morning? Half-full? Half-empty? Either is valid. One will prevail.\n\nMomentum could be the two games the Astros won here, for sure, particularly because the Nats squeezed across all of two runs combined. The Astros, too, have a way of creating their own momentum, because they treat each game against an opponent as a class, an opportunity to learn so the next time they\u2019re tested on the material, they\u2019re better prepared. That\u2019s more frightening going forward than anything Houston did to the Nats here.\n\nBut momentum could also be the right hand into which the Nats will place the ball Sunday night. It belongs to Scherzer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAt this point in time,\u201d Scherzer said, \u201cyou literally just live and breathe each and every day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Astros have lived and breathed here this weekend. But the Nats know they live and breathe at least till Tuesday. That counts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to play Game 5,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cWho would have thought that in the beginning?\u201d\n\nThe beginning of the season and all those struggles seem distant given all the recent success. The last time the Nationals lost back-to-back games before Friday and Saturday nights was \u2014 get this \u2014 Sept. 13 and 14 against Atlanta. This feels like foreign territory. What it is, is baseball.\n\nBaseball, over the course of the season, is broken into little three-game series such as this. Win those series, and you invariably advance in the standings. The Nats\u2019 record in their past 24 three-game series: 16-8.\n\nAD\n\nWho would be lined up to pitch this three-game series against the Astros? That would not only be Scherzer but Strasburg in Game 6 and, if necessary, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in a winner-take-all Game 7. Their ERAs this postseason: 2.16, 1.93 and 2.50, respectively. Their batting averages against this postseason: .161, .234 and .221, respectively.\n\nAD\n\nYes, the Astros counter, in Games 5 and 6, with Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander, who will finish first and second \u2014 in some order \u2014 in the American League Cy Young Award voting. Let\u2019s think. The Nats\u2019 past two postseason victories were against \u2014 checks notes \u2014 Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander. There\u2019s nothing ahead of them they haven\u2019t already done.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d right fielder Adam Eaton said. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind where we\u2019re at \u2014 a best-of-three with Scherzer and Stras going the next two days.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn a world in which momentum is the next day\u2019s starting pitcher, the Nats are just fine. The problem: That\u2019s not the only world in which they live.\n\nWhen the Nationals left Houston, they did it by kicking through the saloon door, rattling Cole and Verlander for nine runs in 13 innings. They got massive home runs from Ryan Zimmerman, Juan Soto, Kurt Suzuki, Eaton and even Michael A. Taylor. When runners reached base, they put bat to ball. In two nights, they scored 17 runs.\n\nAD\n\nSince returning home: squat. The guts of Friday night\u2019s 4-1 loss were the Nats\u2019 utter inability to get a hit with a runner in scoring position, 10 chances with zero knocks. They didn\u2019t get as many opportunities against rookie right-hander Jose Urquidy \u2014 total major league innings before Saturday night: 45\u2153 \u2014 as they did against perennial all-star Zack Greinke. Yet the symptoms returned.\n\nAD\n\nThe most meaningful chance came in the sixth, with Urquidy out of the game. With one out and two on, trailing 4-0, here came Anthony Rendon and Soto, the Nats\u2019 most dangerous hitters. The box score would tell you Rendon got a hit and Soto drove in a run. The replay would show you Rendon hit a grounder off the body of reliever Will Harris for a single that loaded the bases and Soto rolled over a pitch for a grounder that plated the Nats\u2019 lone run.\n\nThat was an opportunity for damage. It was but a flesh wound. In these two home World Series games, the Nats are 1 for 19 with runners in scoring position.\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ll skip what Rodney did in relief in the seventh (single, grand slam, walk, walk, groundout, walk), because repeated exposure to such toxic material can cause permanent damage. What matters going forward: If Rodney or Wander Suero or Javy Guerra appears in a World Series game, bad things are happening to the Nationals.\n\nAD\n\nSaturday night, they all pitched. Saturday night, bad things happened to the Nationals.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s easy to erase the last two days,\u201d Eaton said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to tackle Game 5,\u201d Turner said.\n\nSo concentrate on what\u2019s still to happen, rather than what already did. The home team has yet to win a game in this World Series. Since the advent of the two-three-two home-road format in 1924 \u2014 yes, the year of Washington\u2019s only championship \u2014 the first four games have been won by the road team only two previous times. Those were in 1996, when the Braves took a 2-0 lead in New York but the Yankees came back to take the first two in Atlanta \u2014 and won the series. And in 1986, when the Red Sox won the first two in New York but the Mets came back to take the first two in Boston \u2014 and won the series.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLook away from that, Nats fans, because it gives you the feeling that the series flipped here. The Nationals\u2019 job: Learn about the Astros like the Astros have learned about them. Relax in their approach at the plate, because their underdog status is suddenly restored, and that\u2019s a role they have excelled at since May.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been here pretty much all year,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nAnd above all else, give the ball to Scherzer on Sunday at Nationals Park, then Strasburg on Tuesday night in Houston. It\u2019s what you would have signed up for in spring. It\u2019s what you have now. Two nights are lost. But it\u2019s not all bad.\n\nAD", "description": "The Astros have managed a split.
