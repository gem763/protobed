I went to find out what exactly happened. I have press statements that speak to that. And then (IRR campaigns coordinator Hermann) Pretorius alleged I said the teachers were racist.\n\n\u201cI have asked him on a number of occasions to please bring me the evidence to support his accusations and he has failed to do so. I have also informed him that, should he continue to make these accusations, I will approach the courts and have the allegations tested, as they amount to defamation,\u201d he said.\n\nMphithi questioned why the IRR did not see him as being racist when he led young people to march in Sandton during the jobs summit when the Youth Employment Service programme excluded unemployed white youth.\n\n\u201cThey couldn\u2019t at that point say Luyolo is a racist, because I was fighting for unemployed young white people to be included in the YES programme. I wasn\u2019t a racist when I took Black First Land First to the South African Human Rights Commission for saying it was good that white kids had died in the Vaal. Further, I wasn\u2019t a racist when I reported the EFF for saying Indians in KwaZulu-Natal are all racist.\n\nI only became racist when I protected these young black kids in school who, I felt in that moment, where placed in a position that misrepresented the democratic South Africa that I want to be a part of Luyolo Mphithi\n\nPretorius said the institute had singled out the aforementioned DA leaders because of their public reaction to his opinion piece calling for Mmusi Maimane to be replaced by Alan Winde.\n\nHe said their responses \u201cmade it clear just how volatile the situation within the DA was and how necessary it was for the definitional debate about liberalism to be held in public with the input of ordinary South Africans.\u201d\n\nVan Damme questioned why \u201cthe opinionated black leaders within the DA should be expelled while the white members who have been racist\u201d were not.\n\nPretorius justified what has been deemed by some DA leaders as the institution meddling in party politics by saying that official opposition parties have \u201cspecific constitutional functions\u201d that other parties simply do not have, hence the need for a public and critical input. \u201cOur #SaveTheOpposition campaign has thus far focused on the DA for two reasons. Firstly, because the DA is the official opposition and thereby has specific constitutional functions other parties simply do not have.\n\n\u201cSecondly, because the DA, a self-proclaimed liberal party, is quite clearly and publicly in a serious phase of introspection. What the party decides to do within the next few months will determine whether it can be a strong voice for liberal and nonracial politics in the future.\n\n\u201cThere is a debate raging about the meaning of liberalism in South Africa. The IRR has been a classical liberal think-tank for 90 years. We will not let any opportunity slide to make the case for a nonracial, constitutional, liberal democracy \u2013 we never have, never will,\u201d said Pretorius.\n\nAre the IRR\u2019s comments on the DA and some of its leaders a constructive contribution to SA\u2019s political debate?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword IRR and tell us what you think.
