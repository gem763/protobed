The 2010 law was by and large unpopular until the GOP nearly eradicated it during the last Congress.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe want to debate health care,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to debate pre-existing conditions. We\u2019re not saying our Republican friends are going to think exactly as we do, but let\u2019s have a debate and vote,\u201d Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday.\n\nThe focus on health care seeks to counter the Republican criticism that Democrats\u2019 main goal is impeaching President Trump Donald John TrumpWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio Democrats debate in Ohio: Who came out on top?

Many of the elements have been considered and passed by the House. We have urged McConnell to at least let us debate them. He\u2019s refused every single time,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the 2018 cycle, Democrats were united on preserving ObamaCare, and touting the issue helped them win back the House. However, Democrats going into the 2020 election are divided on \u201cMedicare for All\u201d legislation, which has been ripped by Republicans and former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\nUsually McConnell has an iron grip on the Senate agenda, but Schumer is taking advantage of a little-known law, the Congressional Review Act, which allows the minority party to seize the initiative to overturn an administrative rule as long as it\u2019s done within a certain time period.\n\nSchumer on Tuesday pointed out it\u2019s \u201cone of the rare instances where the minority can force a vote.\u201d\n\nHe sees the Trump administration\u2019s guidance issued in October 2018, which gives states more flexibility to approve health insurance plans that Democrats say fail to meet the \u201cguardrails\u201d of ObamaCare, as a ripe target to test GOP unity.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has concluded the guidance has the force of a rule, making it eligible for termination under the Congressional Review Act.\n\nThe resolution to overturn Trump\u2019s guidance on insurance plans must also pass the House and get the president\u2019s signature to take effect.\n\nTherefore, there\u2019s little to no chance that Democrats succeed in stopping last year\u2019s insurance regulation, though they hope at least to extract a political price from GOP incumbents facing reelection.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans talk a good game about supporting pre-existing condition protections. Unfortunately, the so-called \u2018Section 1332\u2019 rule as written by the Trump Administration would circumvent those protections by allowing states to push junk health insurance plans that cost more and cover less,\u201d Schumer\u2019s office wrote in a memo to reporters last week.\n\nDemocrats also plan to use the Congressional Review Act this week to force a vote on a resolution to repeal Trump\u2019s Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which they say gives companies more leeway to pollute, and a resolution to repeal the IRS rule that prohibits state and local governments from reducing the tax liability of residents who saw their ability to deduct state and local taxes dramatically reduced under Trump\u2019s 2017 tax bill.\n\nBut many Democrats see health care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions as one of their biggest advantages heading into 2020, and some in the party worry it\u2019s getting lost in the uproar over impeachment.\n\n\u201cJust taking an impeachment break to let you know that they are still trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid and mental health while allowing polluters to ruin the planet. Ok, as you were,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz Brian Emanuel SchatzCNN catches heat for asking candidates about Ellen, Bush friendship at debate NBA draws bipartisan backlash over China response Federal aid is reaching storm-damaged communities too late MORE (D-Hawaii) tweeted earlier this month, opting for a tongue-in-cheek way to remind voters that Democrats haven\u2019t forgotten about health care.\n\nSchatz on Tuesday said his reminder \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m worried.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst a backdrop of a corrupt president, we will talk about what we want to do to change things,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to remain focused on health care.\u201d\n\nSen.

It\u2019s all about my state,\u201d said Manchin, who represents a state Trump won by 42 points in 2016.\n\nManchin called the Trump administration\u2019s guidance weakening protections for those constituents \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\nAsked if Democrats have become too consumed with impeachment, Manchin responded, \u201cWe got to do our job and the president has to be the president. We all have to do our job. Letting people with pre-existing conditions go uninsured or unprotected is absolutely wrong. It\u2019s immoral. It\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSenate Republicans facing tough reelections next year have tried to insulate themselves from Democratic attacks by declaring support for protecting people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThe Democratic sponsors of the resolution to overturn Trump\u2019s regulatory guidance, which they say would water down protections for people with illnesses, say they want to put their GOP colleagues on the spot to see how they\u2019ll vote.\n\n\u201cAll of our Republican colleagues are on the record as being supportive of protections for people with pre-existing conditions. This will be the first way to indicate that support,\u201d said Sen.
