(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nA few minutes after D.C. United\u2019s 2-0 victory over Seattle last weekend, captain Wayne Rooney walked past Frederic Brillant in the Audi Field locker room and, while trying to hide a smile, said, \u201cMy goal.\u201d\n\nBoth laughed. It was, in fact, Brillant\u2019s goal, a one-touch finish from the doorstep on a free kick by Rooney that, if not for the French defender\u2019s redirection, likely would have ended up in the net anyway.\n\nGiven the dearth of attention Brillant has received for his defensive contributions, a moment in the spotlight was long overdue \u2014 even if it was for a goal, just his fourth in four MLS regular seasons.\n\n\u201cIf I do my defensive work well, I am very happy with that,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cNow I score a little bit. It\u2019s a bonus. It\u2019s a bonus for me, a bonus for the team.\u201d\n\nBrillant \u2014 who at 34 is United\u2019s oldest player \u2014 performs largely in the shadows, partnering with Steve Birnbaum at center back as most eyes turn to Rooney and an underperforming attack.\n\nBut amid a string of three shutout victories, results that secured a playoff slot and improved United\u2019s postseason outlook, Brillant and his colleagues have garnered admiration.\n\n[United has straight path to home-field advantage in MLS playoffs]\n\nEntering the penultimate match of the regular season, away Sunday against the New York Red Bulls, D.C. (13-10-9, 48 points) is first in the Eastern Conference in fewest goals conceded (38) and second overall behind Los Angeles FC (35).\n\nThe 12 shutouts are second as well, though the total will fall short of the preseason target.\n\n\u201cOur goal,\u201d Birnbaum said, shaking his head, \u201cwas 15.\u201d\n\nHe and Brillant have started 31 of 32 matches together and logged all but 127 of the 5,760 available minutes for a central tandem.\n\nEntering the season, there were more questions about Brillant than Birnbaum, 28, who has started most of his six years in Washington. Homegrown signing Donovan Pines, raw but overflowing with potential, waited in the wings if Brillant stumbled.\n\nBut Brillant has performed at a high level, growing in influence both on the field (aerial duels, tackles, passing and reading the game) and off it as a more vocal leader.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a real rock,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was ever in his character to be a rah-rah guy. I don\u2019t know if he ever understood how impactful he could be because of his experience and the way he goes about his job. But he has added that over the last couple months.\u201d\n\nLast year, in his first campaign with United after two with New York City FC, Brillant was in and out of the lineup, then back in at the end.\n\nOlsen takes blame.\n\n\u201cI overtrained him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pushed him, and sometimes it takes time to figure out what these guys need from a training load and especially when they get a little older. He wore down.\u201d\n\nThis season, United began well defensively, but come summer, not everyone was buying into the plan. Three defeats in eight days and 12 goals allowed in five matches prompted a meeting to air grievances and solve problems.\n\n\u201cYou cannot be good all the time. We are not a robot or a machine,\u201d Brillant said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a choice; we had to start winning. Let\u2019s think about what we did well, what we did wrong. We said the truth.\"\n\nWhat United needed was greater defensive contributions from the midfielders and attackers. United responded with three victories and, despite lopsided deficits in shots and ball possession in the first two games, it did not concede a goal.\n\nWhat has stood out is the willingness of wingers to track back on defense, of defenders to toss their bodies at shots and of the group as a whole to make life difficult for opponents.\n\n\u201cIt was a turning point,\u201d Birnbaum said of the meeting. \u201cWe understood our season was slipping away. If we don\u2019t change something, we are not going to even make the playoffs. It was good: It smacked us in the face.\u201d\n\nBrillant\u2019s bright play comes as his contract is about to expire. He said clubs in Europe have contacted his agent about a possible winter move.\n\nUnited is expected to make an offer when the season ends.\n\n\u201cWe are very happy here, so let\u2019s see about my future,\u201d Brillant said, adding that his two young children speak better English than he does.\n\nFor now, he is focused on a playoff run \u2014 and perhaps knocking in another goal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see some joy at the other end,\u201d Olsen said, \u201cbecause they do so much that goes unnoticed.\u201d\n\nNotes: Forward Ola Kamara, sidelined two matches with a hamstring injury, will be in uniform Sunday, Olsen said. \u2026 Midfielder Lucas Rodr\u00edguez was named to the Argentine under-23 national team for two friendlies at Mexico during the FIFA window, Oct. 7-15. He might end up returning early to prepare for the MLS playoff opener Oct. 19-20. \u2026\n\nAfter winning the first meeting 2-1 last month at Audi Field, the Red Bulls need only a draw Sunday to retain the Atlantic Cup, given to the aggregate winner of the annual series. New York has won it three of the previous four years.\n\nD.C.
