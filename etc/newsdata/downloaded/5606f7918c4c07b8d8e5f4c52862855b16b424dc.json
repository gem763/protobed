No other details were provided.\n\nDEADLY MOSQUITO-BORNE EEE VIRUS OUTBREAK IN MASSACHUSETTS MAY BE CAUSED BY THIS, EPIDEMIOLOGIST SAYS\n\n\u201cAs of Oct. 2, EEE has been confirmed in nine people, with four fatalities. Cases are in Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties,\u201d health officials said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, describes EEE as \u201cone of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).\u201d\n\nSymptoms typically appear about four to 10 days after a bite, with severe cases progressing to encephalitis. Patients may experience high fever, stiff neck, severe headache and lack of energy. Approximately one-third of patients who contract EEE will die, and there is no specific treatment for the virus. Health officials said the only way to protect against the virus to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.\n\nAdditional EEE cases and deaths have been reported in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, among other states.\n\nRHODE ISLAND GIRL, 6, NEARLY DIES AFTER CONTRACTING RARE MOSQUITO-BORNE EEE VIRUS: 'WE COULD HAVE LOST HER'\n\nOn average, five to 10 cases of EEE are reported each year, the CDC says. However, parts of the nation have experienced the worst outbreak of EEE in more than 50 years, USA Today reported.\n\nThe outbreak, in part, may be worsened by warmer-than-normal temperatures, as mosquitoes thrive in warm weather. It\u2019s also possible that a new strain of EEE was carried to the northeastern part of the country from birds \u2014 which are immune to the virus but pass it to mosquitoes when the insects feed on them \u2014 that migrated from Florida, a Massachusetts state epidemiologist recently explained.\n\nThe news comes after Connecticut earlier this week announced the third EEE-linked death in the state.", "description": "A fourth Michigan resident has died from what is considered to be one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne viruses in the nation:\u00a0Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
