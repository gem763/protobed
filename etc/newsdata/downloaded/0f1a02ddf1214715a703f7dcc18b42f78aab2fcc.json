That\u2019s re-segregating the country. Why do we want that?\u201d\n\n\u201cSegregation, as you know, is government-mandated. This is not segregation. If you read the article,\u201d Watson corrected Ingraham, before she cut him off.\n\n\u201cI read the article. I read the article. All right, we got to go,\u201d she said.\n\nHill later chimed in with a tweet pointing out what was \u201cso hilarious\u201d about Ingraham\u2019s stance, given her long history of peddling white nationalist talking points.\n\nWhat\u2019s so hilarious about this is that on an almost nightly basis Laura Ingraham bitches and complains about how white people are being replaced, and how diversity is bad for America.\n\n\n\nThen suddenly ... https://t.co/3qTPmF8laV \u2014 Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) September 10, 2019", "description": "Video of the exchange with the New England Patriots' Benjamin Watson is going viral.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d777d072300001c05512a67.jpeg?cache=ersipdvf4h&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
