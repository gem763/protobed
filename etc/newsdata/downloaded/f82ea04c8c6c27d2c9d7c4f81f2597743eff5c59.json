Zwift is a platform that is enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities.\n\n\"Together we have an opportunity to support a fitter youth, through the creation of a new sustainable sport. We want to make cycling the sport of the 21st Century.\"\n\nThe partnership will see both implement a new UCI rule book for cycling esports in the coming year.\n\nIt is yet to be decided on the venue or the format for the championships, although wherever it is riders will be at least spared the torrential rain that has blighted the actual championships around Yorkshire this week.\n\nCraig Edmondson, CEO of Zwift Esports, said the championships would see both sexes competing over the same distances and sharing equal prize money.\n\n\"We want to deliver fair competition and grow the sport of cycling and get more people active, more often,\" Edmondson said.\n\n\"I'm excited to be able to build a sport, or a discipline, from scratch. And we will do that with parity for men and women. It's a new chapter in the sport's history.\n\n\"We will set the standard for fair play and equality.\"\n\nIn April this year bike maker Canyon launched the first ever professional e-racing team: Canyon ZCC.\n\n\"Racing on Zwift is in its infancy, but compared to the cost of running a traditional cycling team, starting Canyon ZCC was a no-brainer of an opportunity,\" team manager Rhys Howell said.\n\nReuters", "description": "Follow live coverage of day six from the UCI Road World Championships 2019 in Yorkshire, where the women's junior road race and the men's U23 road race take the stage.\u00a0 The men's U23 race begins its 173km route in Doncaster and heads north to Tadcaster and Ripon before\u00a0finishing with three laps on the streets of Harrogate.\u00a0 The first half of the route\u00a0is relatively flat before", "authors": ["Lawrence Ostlere"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/12/Road-World-Championships.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
