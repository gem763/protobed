The address of the LLCs matches the address of a home owned by Sondland, which he has used in the past to host a Republican fundraiser.\n\nA man who answered Sondland\u2019s cell phone hung up when asked to explain the donation and apparent reversal. Buska, Sondland\u2019s spokesperson, said, \u201cI have no comment.\u201d\n\nThe contributions were first flagged by the Center for Responsive Politics and a Twitter-crowdsourced investigation of Trump\u2019s inauguration donors maintained by Huffington Post reporter Christina Wilkie.", "description": "Gordon Sondland distanced himself from a Trump fundraiser he was listed as hosting last year.
