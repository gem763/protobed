I want children but now sex has become only about having kids. She\u2019s always checking her calendar, which is fine, but she doesn\u2019t want anything if the time isn\u2019t right. Sex only has one purpose and I\u2019m not enjoying it anymore. What can I do?\n\nAnswer\n\nThere\u2019s a myth that when couples can\u2019t have children it\u2019s always the female\u2019s fault and this is embedded in the minds of many woman. So, when things aren\u2019t happening the woman automatically takes it upon herself to make things right.\n\nThis seems to be the case with your wife. She seems to have taken over responsibility for making sure she becomes pregnant and has in the process become obsessed. In executing this task, she\u2019s forgotten that there\u2019s more to sex than just procreation and that it\u2019s a way for a couple to bond and keep their love alive. Maybe she needs a reminder of that. I suggest you talk to her about it. If you\u2019re scared you might hurt her feelings, then see a marriage counsellor to help deal with this challenge. It needs to be addressed because once intimacy loses its spontaneity and fun, the relationship becomes dull and boring. She needs to remember the pleasurable part of it so you can both enjoy this aspect of your beautiful union. There\u2019s hope, don\u2019t give up.\n\nAccording to healthy.com, addressing resentments, resolving conflicts, expressing how you feel to your partner may aid in remedying the situation. The website suggests that having such difficult conversations is the key to fuelling one\u2019s sex life.", "description": "Sis Dolly answers some burning questions from our readers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9439/945aab9d5ae7453bae17976a6a8bdd64.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
