The others are Grosse Pointe Park, Grosse Pointe, Grosse Pointe Shores and Grosse Pointe Woods. They cover 10.4 square miles and have a population of about 46,000.\n\n\u201cAll of the Pointes offer something unique to potential buyers that they deem the best fit for them,\u201d said Shana Sine Cameron of Sine & Monaghan Realtors, Real Living LLC. \u201cYou can, in essence, offer the \u2018Pointes\u2019 as a package deal. They are close enough that you can travel by car or bike or walk, even in some cases between them, to get where you need to be. You can talk to people and find out that people have moved between Pointes without hesitation or thought.\u201d\n\nMore: Muthaiga is Nairobi\u2019s Most-Affluent Neighborhood, Offering Privacy and Lush Landscapes\n\nAbout a quarter of the Pointes residents call Grosse Pointe Farms home, according to the 2010 census.\n\nThe \u201cpoint\u201d into Lake St. Clair, from which the five cities get their name, is in the Farms.
