What a fantastic day for those two to test themselves against David and Michael - who are tremendous players - and to come out on top.\"\n\nAmong the quick hands, no-look passes and clinical finishing that led to a quickfire Jonny May double and a try each for Kyle Sinckler and Anthony Watson, the herculean work of England's dynamic duo did not go unnoticed.\n\n\"I thought Tom Curry and Sam Underhill did very well, and the young fella Lewis Ludlam when he came on,\" nodded Jones. \"You know Hooper and Pocock have been at the top level for some time.\"\n\nHooper and Pocock's brilliance helped fire Australia to the World Cup final four years ago but they had no answer to England's dynamic duo, who were fitter, stronger and quicker at the breakdown.\n\n\"It's a bit surreal coming up against him this evening,\" Underhill, 23, said of his idol Pocock, who is retiring from international rugby.\n\n\"Tom and myself were talking about it, he's been such a brilliant player,\" he added.\n\n\"Any young back-row growing up in the last five or 10 years has probably looked at him as a guy that they want to be like and play like.\n\n\"That was the case for myself and Tom - he's been a brilliant role model for kids both on and off the pitch. A genuinely nice guy and a phenomenal career.\"\n\nMan of the match Curry, 21, provided the shuffle pass for May to score his first try but perhaps more tellingly peeled off a scrum under the posts to smash into a charging Koroibete as the Aussies came knocking with the score 27-16 and the game still in the balance.\n\n\"You play rugby for the physicality,\" said Curry.\n\n\"When you get moments like that, it's special. It would be a bit weird if I said making a tackle is probably more exciting than running with the ball.\n\n\"I don't think you start playing rugby to make tackles, but they're both pretty exciting.\"\n\nA dejected Hooper wore a haunted expression after a record-equalling defeat to their fierce rivals.\n\n\"I am gutted, absolutely gutted,\" said the Wallabies captain.\n\n\"There are a lot of players who won't get another chance at a World Cup.\"", "description": "England scrumhalf Ben Youngs described back-row marauders Tom Curry and Sam Underhill as \"phenomenal\" after they crushed Australian spirits in Oita.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7804/4d8931c26cd3477fa7393b5744c746e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
