Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d said England coach Jones. \u201cYou give the country something to cheer about, and with Brexit at the moment they probably need something to cheer about. It\u2019s a job of the team to make the country happy, they\u2019re not as happy as they can be, because there is still a game to go.\n\n\u201cThe crowds here generally at the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in getting us home. Their singing, their general support of the team were fantastic and we urge them to keep doing that.\u201d\n\nJones used the mentality of England being written off to motivate his players against New Zealand, using his press conference appearance last week to claim no one in the room believed they stood a chance against the three-time world champions, and adding that the entire population of Japan would be behind Steve Hansen\u2019s side due to their love of the All Blacks.\n\nBut with Hansen\u2019s side condemned to the dreaded third-place play-off on Friday night against Wales, where will the home fans\u2019 loyalties lie when Saturday night\u2019s main event kicks off?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure mate,\u201d Jones claimed. \u201cAll I know is we are excited about the prospect, we know the final comes with pressure but we are excited about handling that and we feel that\u2019s an advantage we have got.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Jones was simply being modest, but some of the loudest cheers have come for him alone due to his history in leading Japan to their famous victory over South Africa in 2015. On top of that, England fans have been flooding to Tokyo this week in a desperate search for tickets with the number of searches for flights from London increasing week-on-week by more than 3,500 per cent, which is expected to give Jones\u2019s side partisan backing inside the International Stadium Yokohama.\n\nBut that is no guarantee that England will triumph. Jones had not only the backing of the crowd but the added advantage of playing on home soil in 2003 when his Wallabies side came up short against Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s England, and there are a few lessons for the week ahead that he has taken along his well-travelled journey that he hopes will ensure history falls his way this time around.\n\n\u201cIt's always about doing less,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe're at the end of a seven-week tournament so it's about focusing on what's going to have a significant impact on the game. It's not about doing everything, it's about doing certain things right, keeping the players fresh physically, keeping them fresh mentally, making sure they have enough to do off the field and just getting the balance right in preparation because coaches tend to think they've got to do more.\n\n\u201cIt's making sure that the coaches\u2019 discipline is right and we don't over-coach the players, and we allow them to find their own rhythms in the week. They'll be ready to go as you don't lack motivation for a World Cup final.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure they are physically fresh, they are mentally clear, they\u2019ve got the game plan in their head, they know how they want to play and are aware of the challenges ahead. And we\u2019ll be that on Saturday. That\u2019s why we can be fairly relaxed this week, we\u2019ve done a lot of hard work, we know what\u2019s ahead of us, we know we can play to our strengths, we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of what we take away from the Springboks [against Wales], but again the point is they may come up with some different and we\u2019ll need to adapt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of who the referee is going to be because there are only two left. We\u2019ve played under both of those guys and we know that they are first class referees. We know that they\u2019ll manage the game well and they\u2019ll give all the obvious penalties and we\u2019ll adapt to that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played at Yokohama Stadium, it\u2019s a beautiful pitch, the support of the crowd is fantastic. We\u2019re relaxed and we\u2019re ready to go. The big thing for us is holding back the players this week, making sure they don\u2019t go before siren rings.\u201d", "description": "Eddie Jones has challenged his players lift the nation out of the Brexit gloom by making the English public \u201cas happy as they can be\u201d with victory in this weekend\u2019s Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/14/Eddie-Jones.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
