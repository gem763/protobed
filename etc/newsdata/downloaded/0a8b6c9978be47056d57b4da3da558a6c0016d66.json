Maxwell Grinacoff, a derivatives and quantitative strategist at Macro Risk Advisors, called the index\u2019s 1.9% month-to-date drop a \u201cspooky \u2018Vol-tober\u2019 sell-off\u201d in a note on Wednesday, advising investors to employ hedges to manage the swings.\n\n\u201cTrade talks will make for twitchy trades,\u201c said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd.\n\nShortly after U.S. stock markets closed with gains amid optimism about trade talks on Wednesday, S&P 500 futures began tanking on a South China Morning Post report that deputy-level discussions had made \u201cno progress\u201d and that principal Chinese negotiators might cut short their stay.\n\nThe market rallied on separate reports that top Chinese envoy Liu He would remain in Washington through Friday, then turned lower on another wave of selling. The next rebound came on news that the White House may roll out a previously agreed currency pact with China as part of a deal that could also suspend a planned tariff increase next week.\n\nBy 8:18 a.m. in London, S&P 500 futures were almost back to where they started. The yen, oil, gold and Treasury futures saw similar fluctuations.\n\nRead more: Treasuries Trading Electrified in Asia by Trade Confusion\n\nInvestor nervousness has increased against a backdrop of deteriorating economic data and escalating tensions between the U.S. in China.\n\nOn Monday, the Trump administration moved to blacklist Chinese tech firms including video-surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., alleging that they were complicit in human-rights violations in Xinjiang. U.S. officials are also reportedly moving ahead with discussions around possible restrictions on portfolio flows into China. A fight over free speech between China and the NBA, triggered by a tweet backing Hong Kong\u2019s protesters, has added to the tense mood.\n\n\u201cOverall the market is pretty on the edge as we\u2019ve seen bigger negative reactions toward trade news,\u201d said Mingze Wu, a foreign-exchange trader at INTL FCStone Global Payments in Singapore.\n\nSome investors have responded by adding hedges, helping push the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, steadily higher since late September. October futures on the index rose 2.3% on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty in predicting the final outcome of the trade dispute poses a challenge for investors,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, wrote in a note on Wednesday. \u201cNot even the negotiators themselves can yet be confident of the final result.\u201d\n\n(Updates markets in eighth and 12th paragraphs.)\n\n--With assistance from Jenny Leonard, Ruth Carson and Stephen Spratt.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Joanna Ossinger in Singapore at jossinger@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Christopher Anstey at canstey@bloomberg.net, Michael Patterson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Even for investors hardened by more than a year of trade-war headlines, it\u2019s been a chaotic few hours.Conflicting signals on the prospects for a deal between the U.S. and China sent S&P 500 futures on one of their wildest rides in recent memory, triggering four 1%-plus swings in contracts", "authors": ["Joanna Ossinger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dtZVQko7ZaWp0vOO09EUsw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/56ad7ed37cae315574067826f7da2235", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
