The inconspicuous absence of starting quarterback Mitch Trubisky after a shoulder injury should not have brought this team to a grinding halt, given it was hardly firing on all cylinders. Yet the Oakland Raiders immediately revealed their intent to drown out the noise in pursuit of a second consecutive upset after foiling the Colts last week.\n\nA sickening elbow injury to defensive talisman Akiem Hicks after a mere eight snaps certainly exposed what could be the NFL\u2019s most fearsome defence just a little more. And Derek Carr gleefully began plotting his way downfield, coolly converting five of his first six third downs as the crowd smelt an upset. After conceding just five touchdowns in their first four games, the Raiders slashed the Bears defence twice in five minutes through rookie running back Josh Jacobs and back-up Deandre Washington \u2013 much to the chagrin of Jacobs fantasy owners.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Another flashy rookie back in David Montgomery punched it in and the Bears had life.\n\nChase Daniel\u2019s meticulously managed gameplay was then torn up as Matt Nagy smelt blood, to the delight of the fans. Daniel was unleashed with five minutes remaining in the third and aired one out towards Anthony Miller deep right, with the receiver ripping the ball away from the covering Lemarcus Joyner. Allen Robinson was then found for the touchdown, pulling them within three, yet the loudest roar was still to come.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A wave of noise from the Bears fans produced an atmosphere seldom seen in more than a decade of football in the capital. Robinson, once more, profited, this time to snatch the lead for the first time in the game.\n\nLike a wounded animal, the Chicago defence suddenly came to life, with Sherrick McManis punching the ball clean out of Trevor Davis\u2019s hands just a yard away from the end zone in tribute to innovator and former Bear Charles Tillman, who coined the play the \u2018Peanut Punch\u2019. It was a spectacular play that this team has become accustomed to showcasing on a weekly basis.\n\nRobinson then flashed once more, showing majestic spacial awareness mid-flight, kicking his foot into the turf like deep sea diver before he was bundled out of bounds in one of the moments of the game.\n\nA gutsy Carr rallied Oakland though, finding comfort from his tight ends Darren Waller and Foster Moreau. And Jacobs capitalised, leaping high over the line of scrimmage and over the line before being thrown backwards - Oakland led once more.\n\nDaniel was given one last chance though with less than two minutes remaining, yet emphatically reminded us of who he is: a back-up. Crumbling under pressure, he handed Gareon Conley game-clinching interception and the upset, bringing the curtain down on one of the greatest London games. Three more games await, but this one might just be the one that clinches the city a team of its own someday.", "description": "A fierce, hostile cacophony of whistles pierced the ears of those\u00a0NFL fans in attendance at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a thrilling game in that raised\u00a0the bar for this sport in London.", "authors": ["Jack Rathborn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/21/Josh-Jacobs-celebrates-scoring-a-touchdown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
