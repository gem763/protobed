We must therefore find alternatives to plastic that protect the quality of our food while minimising our impact on the environment.\"\n\nCoupe added that Sainsbury's is asking its suppliers and customers to work with the company to \"help us make this important change\".\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, at current rates of pollution, there will likely be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050.

In December 2017 Britain joined the other 193 UN countries and signed up to a resolution to help eliminate marine litter and microplastics in the sea. It is estimated that about eight million metric tons of plastic find their way into the world's oceans every year. Once in the Ocean plastic can take hundreds of years to degrade, all the while breaking down into smaller and smaller 'microplastics,' which can be consumed by marine animals, and find their way into the human food chain.
