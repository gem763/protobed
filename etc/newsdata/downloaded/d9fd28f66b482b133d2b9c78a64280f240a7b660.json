Follow the cyber team, Maggie Miller (@magmill95), and the tech team, Emily Birnbaum (@birnbaum_e) and Chris Mills Rodrigo (@chrisismills)\n\nBIG HEARING NEXT WEEK: The co-founder and CEO of Reddit and a top policy official with Google are slated to testify next week before a key House panel about the tech industry's legal protections, the committee announced Friday.\n\nThe public hearing scheduled for Wednesday marks the latest sign that the House Energy and Commerce Committee is seriously looking at the possibility of tweaking or even partially pulling back the industry's liability shield.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReddit chief Steve Huffman will testify at the hearing alongside Katherine Oyama, Google's global head of intellectual property policy, as well as leading experts on the law that protects tech -- including Danielle Citron, a law professor at Boston University School of Law, and Corynne McSherry, the legal director of top privacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nTop Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced their intention to hold the hearing last month.\n\n\"The Internet has opened America's homes to a wealth of social, economic and educational opportunities,\" Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-N.J.) said in a joint statement with the heads of the committee's panels on technology and consumer protection. \"Sadly, bad actors, both foreign and domestic, have abused this access to peddle extremism, disinformation and hatred that divides our nation.\"\n\nWhy Section 230 matters: At issue is a provision called Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which protects internet platforms from being sued over content posted by users and how it chooses to moderate those user-generated posts.\n\nIncreasingly, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in both chambers have hammered Section 230 as a \"sweetheart deal\" that protects Big Tech from dealing with issues on their platforms including hate speech, terrorist content and disinformation.\n\nWhile several federal lawmakers have floated changes to Section 230 over the past several months, there are still no bipartisan or bicameral proposals on the table.\n\nE&C's role: The Energy and Commerce Committee has primary jurisdiction over Section 230, and over the past several months, top members of the panel have expressed interest in various proposals to hold platforms \"accountable\" for their content moderation decisions.\n\n\"This hearing will explore whether online companies are appropriately using the tools they have -- including protections Congress granted in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act -- to foster a healthier Internet,\" Pallone said in the statement with Reps.

The page indicates that his Minneapolis rally had more than 40,000 views as of Friday, and that his campaign plans to broadcast his rally next week in Dallas.\n\nTrump also plans to hold a rally in Louisiana later on Friday.\n\nThe president is known for his prolific Twitter presence, but his aides have signaled in recent months that the president is looking to gain a foothold on other platforms as well.\n\nThe Trump campaign advertised heavily in social media platforms such as Facebook in 2016, a strategy it has continued into the 2020 race.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment on joining Twitch.\n\nTrump is not the first presidential candidate to join the platform, which is popular among the gamer community but has niches for many interests, including politics.

Facebook dealt with the issue earlier this year when a mass shooter filmed himself attacking worshippers at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, an incident that left more than 50 dead and dozens injured.\n\nRead more on Trump's move here.\n\nSHIELD ME FROM THIS: The House will vote on legislation later this month aimed at limiting foreign interference in U.S. elections after a bipartisan report from the Senate Intelligence Committee this week called on Congress to take action on the issue.\n\nThe move by House Democrats is likely to place additional pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellAre Senate Republicans certain that Trump can return to office?

The funds would be available to local education agencies to create programs on media literacy and to state agencies to create \"advisory councils\" to establish state-wide media literacy guidelines.\n\nThe bill was introduced days after the Senate Intelligence Committee released its bipartisan report on Russian social media disinformation efforts in the run-up to the 2016 elections.\n\nThe committee found that the Kremlin directed the Russian Internet Research Agency to spread disinformation with the goal of helping now-President Trump over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton'Lock him up' chant erupts at Trump rally after Eric Trump attacks Biden Minneapolis mayor proclaims 'Love Trumps Hate Day' ahead of Trump visit Krystal Ball: Lauer rape allegations represent 'ugly underbelly' of news outlets MORE, echoing findings detailed by former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerFox News legal analyst says Trump call with Ukraine leader could be 'more serious' than what Mueller 'dragged up' Lewandowski says Mueller report was 'very clear' in proving 'there was no obstruction,' despite having 'never' read it Fox's Cavuto roasts Trump over criticism of network MORE.\n\nThe committee also included a set of recommendations for Congress, the Trump administration and social media companies in order to prevent future foreign disinformation efforts, including the idea of creating a \"public initiative\" aimed at promoting \"critical thinking skills\" to help Americans identify disinformation online.\n\nRead more here.\n\nSPACEX, NASA MAKE AMENDS: NASA Director Jim Bridenstine James (Jim) Frederick BridenstineNASA's Bridenstine gives SpaceX a reality check Sanders NASA plan is definitely Earth first When you fail to soft-land on the moon, try, try again MORE says that the agency could begin using SpaceX equipment for manned orbital missions as early as next year if the company does not run into unexpected hurdles with the development of its crew capsule.\n\nBridenstine told reporters during a visit to Elon Musk Elon Reeve MuskHillicon Valley: Senate Intel report urges action to prevent 2020 Russian meddling | Republicans warn Microsoft of 'urgent' Huawei threat | Court rules FBI surveillance violated Americans' rights Court documents show Elon Musk privately called himself a 'f---ing idiot' after attack on British diver 60 years of space junk: The challenge of orbital debris MORE's SpaceX headquarters in California that if \"everything goes according to plan,\" the agency will begin manned missions using SpaceX's capsule in the first quarter of 2020.\n\n\"If everything goes according to plan, it would be the first quarter of next year,\" he said, according to Reuters, while adding that the agency is \"not going to take any undue risk\" by sticking to an unrealistic timeline.\n\nMusk also addressed reporters at the news conference, explaining that despite difficulties in developing the crew capsule's parachute, the company planned to finish testing by the end of the year.\n\n\"Testing will be complete and hardware at the Cape [Canaveral] by the end of December,\" he said, according to Reuters.\n\nNASA's use of private contractors such as SpaceX for future space flights comes as the agency currently spends millions every year to use Russian technology necessary for reaching the International Space Station.\n\nRead more here.\n\nA LIGHTER CLICK: Footage of people who must have a death wish.\n\nAN OP-ED TO CHEW ON: Automation won't destroy trade; it might even boost it\n\nNOTABLE LINKS FROM AROUND THE WEB:\n\nStudy links Russian tweets to release of hacked emails.
