WTR is also above the rising 200-day moving average line and prices are looking a little extended above the line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line shows a positive pattern telling us that buyers of WTR have been more aggressive the past year.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is turning up to a fresh buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of WTR, below, we can see that prices made a large consolidation pattern between $32 and $38/$39 that can support a significant rally. Prices have risen since late 2018 but more gains look possible.\n\nWTR is above the rising 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is bullish and so is the MACD oscillator.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of WTR, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $67 or roughly a double from the lower part of the consolidation pattern (see the commentary about the weekly chart above).\n\nBottom line strategy: WTR might trade sideways a little longer and traders could use that as an opportunity to go long or add to existing longs. Risk below $42 looking for gains to the $67 area.", "description": "Let's fill our eco-friendly water bottle and take a look at the charts and indicators....WTR", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Aqua America'S Charts Are Bullish", "Go Long Or Add To Longs Here", "Let'S Fill Our Eco-Friendly Water Bottle", "Take A Look At The Charts", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Peter Tchir"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/90b50de7-5d0e-11e8-996b-d9cfef87e9d2.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
