Both men served on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company in the former Soviet Bloc country.\n\nHunter Biden was paid $50,000 per month for his service, at a time when Ukrainian prosecutors were invetigating corruption in the company.\n\nPresident Trump has highlighted Joe Biden's public claim that he once threatened to scuttle $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine's government didn't fire the lead prosecutor.\n\nTwitter trends on Thursday morning included '#ParodyIsFairUse' as Trump fans began posting their own copies of the video, seeming to dare the social media platform to take them all down\n\nDonald Trump Jr. reposted the deleted video himself, along with a suggestion that Twitter bucked to Nickelback's pressure too quickly\n\n'I looked at them and said: \"I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money\",' the former VP recalled in a January 2018 speech. 'Well, son of a b***h. He got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.'\n\nHunter Biden has acknowledged 'once' speaking with his father about his foreign money ties. And a week after the pair flew aboard Air force Two to China in 2016, a venture capital fund the younger Biden oversaw got a $1.5 billion cash infusion from investors through the Bank of China.\n\nCurrent Ukrainian officials have not accused either Biden of wrongdoing in connection with Burisma. Former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko told The Washington Post last week that 'from the perspective of Ukrainian legislation, [Hunter Biden] did not violate anything.'\n\nThe president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, however, tells a different story.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has trolled Joe Biden for weeks over his part in the swirling Ukraine controversy\n\nHe wrote in notes from a January 2019 phone call with the fired prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, that Shokin claimed he was forced to back off his investigation into Burisma.\n\nShokin, who was himseld accused of rampant corruption during his time in office, told Giuliani he stopped his probe 'out of fear of the United States' after America's top diplomat told him to use 'white gloves.'\n\n'According to Mr. Shokin, that implied do nothing,' Giuliani's notes say.\n\nShokin, he wrote, recalled being told that Joe Biden was holding up aid payments to Ukraine because of the investigation.\n\nThe Nickelback song featured in the 'Photograph' video includes the lyrics: 'Look at this photograph, every time I do it makes me laugh.'\n\nSpin.com reports that the ensuing line 'And what the hell is on Joey\u2019s head' is an apparently reference to Joe Biden's hair plugs.", "description": "A video attack against Biden that Trump tweeted disappeared from his feed after representatives of the band Nickelback made a copyright infringement claim against the president.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/14/19253740-0-image-a-5_1570108557376.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
