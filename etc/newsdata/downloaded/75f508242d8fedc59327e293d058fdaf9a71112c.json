Those selfies could tell stalkers where you live.", "language": "en", "text": "The incident raises serious questions about privacy in the age of ubiquitous high-resolution images and social media. Today, the average smartphone user can create incredibly detailed photos and share them with millions of people at the click of a button. The same process can also expose personal information few selfie-takers realize they are revealing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs the ways in which you can use social media for investigative work become more widely known, I expect we\u2019ll see more incidents like this,\u201d said Eliot Higgins, founder of the investigative site Bellingcat and one of the pioneers of open-source and social media-based investigative techniques.\n\nAD\n\nPosting every moment of life on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and other social media sites has become an everyday part of life, particularly for influencers and stars who market their lifestyles as a brand. At the same time, phone cameras are locked in a technology arms race, adding more and more detail to selfies and other pictures they take.\n\nApple\u2019s newly released iPhone 11 Pro models have three camera lenses each and will soon include a software update that uses artificial intelligence to clarify details further. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy A9 has four lenses, and the Huawei P30 Pro uses a combination of hardware and software to create up to 50x zoom.\n\nAD\n\nThat level of detail combined with frequent postings and celebrity can prove troublesome, as it did for Japanese pop star Ena Matsuoka, whom the alleged stalker targeted. She said in a statement last month that she will return to performing live after taking some time off \u2014 and that she will post on social media in the meantime as much as possible.\n\nAD\n\nThose with a large online following can frequently spark the feeling of being a friend to strangers, says Mae Karwowski, chief executive of the influencer marketing agency Obviously. Young social media stars often need reminding that everything they share is public, she says.\n\nShe tells influencers she works with to generally avoid posting real-time information, and that whenever possible, they should shoot photos in a staged environment or a private space.\n\nAD\n\nParticularly after they reach more than 100,000 followers, influencers need to \u201creally be aware of identifiable markers of where they are\u201d in their postings, Karwowski said.\n\nWhile celebrities and public figures long faced security concerns because of obsessed fans, stalking has become easier with access to a wealth of digital information from targets gleaned from the Internet. Social media posts can also help disclose their location, even if the post isn\u2019t tagged to a particular area.\n\nAD\n\nThe alleged stalker\u2019s use of Google Maps to pinpoint Matsuoka\u2019s location reflects other criticism of the company\u2019s Street View feature, which provides stereoscopic, ground-level images of neighborhoods around the globe. It has triggered privacy concerns in countries such as India, where officials have rejected Google\u2019s proposals to expand its service. In the United States, the company blurs license plates and faces, but many other details \u2014 from dogs to graffiti \u2014 are visible.\n\nAD\n\nGoogle declined to comment. Tokyo police did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCrystal Justice, chief marketing and development officer for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said the Matsuoka case is a variation on the social media-focused \u201cdigital abuse\u201d the organization has seen increase exponentially since 2012. Victims of this type of abuse commonly report that their abuser employs social media to monitor and harass them.\n\n\u201cThe technology itself isn\u2019t the issue,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut when we design technology, we have to consider all the users, even those that have the most awful of intentions.\u201d\n\nAkiko Kashiwagi contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Marie C.
