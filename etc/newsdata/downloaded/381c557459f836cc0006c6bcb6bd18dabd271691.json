Defensive lineman Tim Settle bounced his head to the music playing from his portable speaker. Teammates Morgan Moses and Tony Bergstrom eagerly conversed about what had transpired on the field. As players like Ereck Flowers and Adrian Peterson talked to reporters, they smiled and laughed \u2014 something rarely seen over the first five weeks of the season.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter to the Redskins that they barely hung on in a 17-16 victory over the Miami Dolphins. Yes, Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Dolphins almost stole the game, scoring a touchdown with six seconds left \u2014 only to fail to convert a two-point attempt. And yes, they were facing the Dolphins, a team most consider to be tanking for the No.1 pick.\n\nBut on this occasion, a win was enough.\n\n\u201cShoot, man,\u201d Flowers said. \u201cA big relief.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins welcomed in the Bill Callahan era with a win reflecting the personality of their new coach.\n\nAfter Washington (1-5) fired coach Jay Gruden last week and named Callahan the interim, the 63-year-old told reporters his players needed to get back to \u201cfundamental football\u201d by staying disciplined.\n\nCallahan wanted the Redskins to dominate on the ground and be physical on defense. Under Gruden, Callahan had felt Washington had gotten away from a formula that worked last year.\n\nHe changed practice, stressing an up-tempo pace and attention to detail.\n\nAgainst Miami, the Redskins were committed throughout the game to the run \u2014 picking up 145 yards on 33 carries.\n\nThey were stout on defense, giving up just three points in the first three quarters. They even limited their penalties, committing just six.\n\nStill Miami came oh-so-close to ruining it all.\n\nThe veteran Fitzpatrick, who took over for Josh Rosen in the fourth quarter, marched the Dolphins downfield to scores twice.\n\nWith just more than two minutes left, Fitzpatrick found wide receiver Devante Parker with a bullet to the end zone for the touchdown.\n\nOn the conversion, the winless Dolphins chose to play for the victory instead of forcing overtime.\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s attempted screen pass at the line of scrimmage bounced off running back Kenyan Drake\u2019s hands, falling harmlessly to the ground.\n\nThe Redskins escaped.\n\n\u201cOur guys were resilient,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we talked about all week \u2014 being relentless, being resilient \u2014 and I think it showed. \u2026 How we practiced this week transferred to the game. It was good to see that reality.\u201d\n\nFor Washington, Miami\u2019s failed two-point conversion was an example of how preparation through the week paid off.\n\nComing into the game, the Redskins were aware the Dolphins liked to run a lot of screens and when the defense saw Drake start in motion, they figured either a screen was coming or Fitzpatrick would have targeted Preston Williams on a fade on the opposite side of the field.\n\nEven if Drake had caught it, four Washington defenders were there to make the play.\n\n\u201cThey had been running screens to the back all game,\u201d safety Landon Collins said. \u201c \u2026 We kind of knew one of those two guys were going to get the ball.\u201d\n\nIn days before the game, fans and experts mocked the matchup \u2014 with some calling it the \u201cIneptitude Bowl\u201d or the \u201cToilet Bowl.\u201d Fans expected bad football, and the two teams delivered \u2014 punting six times in the first quarter. Washington\u2019s razor-thin victory didn\u2019t necessarily inspire confidence, either.\n\nIn the locker room, though, there was no talk of Sunday\u2019s win turning around a season. Moses said he knows there is a lot to clean up.\n\nBut the Redskins were encouraged. They were pleased that Peterson rushed for more than 100 yards for the first time since last December. Callahan liked how Washington opened the second half, with quarterback Case Keenum finding Terry McLaurin for his second touchdown of the afternoon and then how the defense responded by picking off Rosen for the second time.\n\nSunday marked the first time this season that the Redskins had consistent success on the ground. After a slow start to begin the game, Washington ripped off an 18-yard gain in the second quarter, following it up with three straight runs.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t realize those one-yard gains are probably the most dangerous,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing the (expletive) out of the defense \u2026 and then you come back again, running it about three or four times and you get your five-or-six-yard gain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely get into (a) groove,\u201d said Peterson, who had 118 yards on 23 carries.\n\nSuccess on the gorund opened up the passing game, too.\n\nKeenum, who was re-named the starter on Friday, found McLaurin for three big plays, two of which resulted in touchdowns. Keenum wasn\u2019t perfect \u2014 he threw for just 166 yards and completed 52% of his passes \u2014 but he played well enough that Callahan said the 31-year-old will start next week against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nAs for the near-collapse, defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said it doesn\u2019t matter how wins happen in the NFL.\n\nThough Allen wasn\u2019t overly ecstatic over the win \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not jumping for joy,\u201d he said \u2014 he acknowledged what a victory meant for him and his teammates.\n\n\u201cWe were 0-5 and won our first game,\u201d Allen said. \u201c(Expletive) yeah, we\u2019re going to be excited.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
