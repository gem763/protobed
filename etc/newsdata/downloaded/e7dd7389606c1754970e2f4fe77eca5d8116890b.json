Everything from a study\u2019s design to the way its data is analyzed can affect the outcome of a particular experiment\u2014hence the frustrating and common phenomenon where something considered healthy today is condemned tomorrow.\n\nBut new nutrition recommendations published in the Annals of Internal Medicine are causing even more of a stir than usual. The guidelines say individuals do not need to eat less red and processed meat to stay healthy, despite prior studies that have linked these foods to conditions such as heart disease and cancer, and years of scientific support for a largely plant-based diet.\n\n\u201cFor the majority of people, but not everyone, continuing their red and processed meat consumption is the right approach,\u201d says first author Bradley Johnston, an associate professor of community health and epidemiology at Canada\u2019s Dalhousie University. That\u2019s three to four servings per week for most North Americans, Johnston says.\n\nNot everyone in the nutrition community agrees with that assessment. \u201cTheir recommendations are really irresponsible,\u201d says Dr. Frank Hu, chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of a recent BMJ study that linked eating red and processed meat to higher mortality risk. Ahead of the new paper\u2019s publication, Hu and his colleagues completed their own analysis of data from studies used to form the new recommendations, and \u201ccalculated that a modest reduction in red meat consumption could hypothetically reduce mortality by 7.6% [at the U.S. population level], or approximately 200,000 deaths a year,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge estimate.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey suggest about 60% of meat eaten in the U.S. is red, with processed meats like bacon and sausage accounting for about a quarter of total meat consumption, according to a separate study published in June.\n\nEating less meat is a common dietary goal. The U.S. federal dietary guidelines recommend limiting weekly meat, poultry and egg intake to 26 ounces, noting that diets lower in meat are associated with better cardiovascular and overall health. The World Health Organization has also classified processed meat as a human carcinogen, with strong links to colorectal cancer, and recommends limiting intake.\n\nThe new recommendations break with that conventional wisdom. They were compiled by a panel of 14 people\u2014three of whom voted against the final recommendation\u2014representing fields including research methodology, nutritional epidemiology, dietetics, family medicine and internal medicine. Conclusions were based on five different reviews of prior research on red and processed meat consumption, touching on both health outcomes and cultural preferences. To assess those studies, the team used a research approach that rates the certainty of existing evidence, giving more weight to things like randomized controlled trials\u2014in which one study group carries out a certain behavior, while another acts as a control group\u2014and less weight to observational studies, which use patterns in a dataset to find associations between a behavior and an outcome.\n\nThe panel also focused on the \u201cabsolute risk\u201d associated with eating meat, rather than changes in \u201crelative risk,\u201d which Johnston says can sometimes distort the magnitude of an effect. \u201cIf the baseline risk in the population of an illness is 2% and after a study it\u2019s shown to reduce to 1%, that\u2019s a 50% relative risk reduction, but it\u2019s actually only a 1% absolute risk reduction,\u201d he explains.\n\nUsing that framework, the group found \u201conly low-certainty evidence of a very small reduction in cancer or other adverse health consequences from reducing meat consumption [by three servings per week,]\u201d Johnston says. \u201cFor most people who enjoy eating meat, the uncertain health benefits of cutting down are unlikely to be worth it.\u201d (The authors did not consider non-health-related reasons for cutting back on meat, such as ethical or environmental concerns.)\n\nBut Hu says the panel\u2019s methodology is most appropriate for drug research, which relies heavily on randomized controlled trials. By contrast, most nutrition research is observational, since it\u2019s difficult logistically and ethically to ask people to change their eating habits to the extent and length necessary for a randomized controlled trial. In this case, that distinction \u201cled the authors to dismiss massive amounts of data from large cohort studies,\u201d Hu says.\n\nWhile health recommendations should not be based on a single observational study, Hu says it\u2019s often necessary to use a body of observational evidence to craft public-health guidance. Recommendations that are today taken as fact\u2014such as avoiding smoking and staying physically active\u2014were based on mostly observational evidence, Hu notes. \u201cThis kind of demand for drug-trial evidence for nutritional studies is unrealistic and naive,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. John Sievenpiper, an associate professor of nutrition sciences at the University of Toronto, voiced his own concerns in commentary posted on Harvard\u2019s website. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cthe leadership of the paper chose to play up the low certainty of evidence by [the assessment methodology] as opposed to the protective associations that directly support current recommendations to lower meat intake.\u201d Sievenpiper also added that the study did not assess things like substituting animal protein for plant protein, which is generally thought to be a healthy swap. That\u2019s potentially important, since replacing red meat with an equivalent plant protein, like beans or nuts, would likely have a different effect than replacing those calories with refined carbohydrates or other processed foods.\n\nThe American Institute for Cancer Research also disputed the panel\u2019s findings in a statement. \u201cRegularly eating processed meat, and higher consumption of red meat, increases your risk of colorectal cancer; suggesting that there is no need to limit these foods would put people at risk of colorectal cancer and further undermine public confidence in dietary advice,\u201d Dr. Nigel Brockton, the group\u2019s vice president of research, said in the statement.\n\nStill, Johnston stands by his findings. \u201cIf [guidelines are] based on observational studies, it\u2019s hard to make strong causal inferences on red meat or processed meat, given other possibly confounding factors\u201d such as a person\u2019s socioeconomic class, lifestyle and other dietary habits, Johnston says. \u201cThere is some evidence of an association between red meat and important outcomes and processed meat and important health outcomes\u2014but there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.", "description": "Should you stop eating red meat?
