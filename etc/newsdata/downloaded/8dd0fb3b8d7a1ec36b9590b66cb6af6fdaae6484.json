(\u201cHemostemix\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX VENTURE: HEM; OTCQB: HMTXF), a biotechnology company developing and commercializing blood-derived stem cell therapies for unmet medical conditions, is pleased to provide a summary of the presentation entitled \u201cAutologous Stem Cell Treatment for CLI Patients with No Revascularization Options: An Update of the Hemostemix ACP-01 Trial With 4.5 Year Followup.\u201d Lead investigator Dr. York Hsiang, Professor of Vascular Surgery, University of British Columbia gave this update at the 41st Annual Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery Meeting on September 14, 2019.\n\n\n\nDr. Hsiang reported on the blinded results from the long-term follow-up of the first cohort of patients enrolled at two trial sites, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute (\u201cVCHRI\u201d) located in Vancouver, BC, led by principal investigator, Dr. York N. Hsiang, MB, ChB, MHSc, FRCSC and University Health Network, Peter Monk Cardiac Centre located in Toronto, Ontario, led by principal investigator Dr. Thomas Lindsay, MDCM, MSc, FRCSC, FACS.\n\nFollowing is a summary of the results and conclusion:\n\nTwelve patients with CLI with no interventional options were enrolled at two treatment centers (10 male, 2 female, mean age 76)\n\nPrior to treatment, three patients had ischemic rest pain, eight patients had ulceration, and one patient had gangrene\n\nStudy subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive injection of ACP-01 or placebo into their most affected lower extremity and followed for at least 1 year\n\nHealing of ulcers and resolution of ischemic rest pain occurred in 10 of the 12 patients (83%)\n\nThere were no clinically significant safety issues\n\nOutcomes were maintained for up to 4.5 years. (3.5 years for two patients, 3 years for one patient, and one patient who died after ulcer healing secondary to congestive heart failure)\n\nThese blinded preliminary results in the study are promising, and show an acceptable safety profile for ACP-01\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d) recently met to review patient safety data in the ongoing Phase II clinical trial for CLI. The DSMB did not find safety concerns with ACP-01 and recommended continuing to enroll patients in the trial. The clinical trial is ongoing at 13 clinical sites in the US and Canada, with several additional sites in the process of being initiated. To date, 46 of the planned 95 patients have been enrolled and treated in the study.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with these blinded long term follow up results, and the recommendation of the DSMB, which are consistent with the findings reported in our two previous published studies of ACP-01 in CLI patients,\u201d said Dr. Alan Jacobs, President and Chief Medical Officer of Hemostemix. \u201cPatients with critical limb ischemia face a high rate of amputation when revascularization treatment options are exhausted, so seeing this level of improvement, and outcomes maintained for up to 4.5 years after treatment, is extremely encouraging.\u201d\n\nABOUT HEMOSTEMIX INC.\n\nHemostemix is a publicly traded clinical-stage biotechnology company that develops and commercializes innovative blood-derived cell therapies for medical conditions not adequately addressed by current treatments. It is one of the first clinical-stage biotech companies to test a stem-cell therapy in an international, multicenter, Phase II clinical trial for patients with critical limb ischemia (\u201cCLI\u201d), a severe form of peripheral artery disease (\u201cPAD\u201d) caused by reduced blood flow to the legs. The Phase II trial targets a participant\u2019s diseased tissue with proprietary cells grown from his or her blood that can support the formation of new blood vessels. The Company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio includes over 50 patents issued or pending throughout the world. Hemostemix has a manufacturing contract with Aspire Health Science, LLC (\u201cAspire\u201d), for the production of ACP-01 and for research and development purposes at Aspire\u2019s Orlando, Florida, facility. Building towards commercialization, Hemostemix has also licensed the use, sale and import of ACP-01 for certain indications to Aspire in certain jurisdictions. The Company is continuing research and development of its lead product, ACP-01 with other applications, including cardiovascular, neurological and vascular indications.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.hemostemix.com or email office@hemostemix.com .\n\nContact:\n\nKyle Makofka, CEO\n\nSuite 2150, 300 \u2013 5th Avenue S.W.\n\nCalgary, Alberta T2P 3C4\n\nPhone: (403) 506-3373\n\nE-Mail: kmakofka@hemostemix.com\n\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Service Provider (as that term is defined under the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis release may contain forward-looking statements.
