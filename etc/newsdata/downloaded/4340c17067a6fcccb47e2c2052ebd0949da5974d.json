(Picture: That\u2019s It, I\u2019m Ring Shaming/Facebook)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a wedding to bring out the internet\u2019s nasty side.\n\nBe it vulva-styled bridesmaids dresses, \u2018trashy\u2019 wedding invitations or a questionable dinner spread, people of the web certainly love to pick apart someone\u2019s special day.\n\nThere\u2019s even an entire Facebook group named That\u2019s It I\u2019m Wedding Shaming, dedicated to airing what people deem to be the most \u2018cringe-worthy\u2019 weddings and wedding-related events. It\u2019s got more than 130,000 members, and averages more than 800 posts per month.\n\nIn a similar group named That\u2019s It, I\u2019m Ring Shaming, a woman posted an image of her mother\u2019s engagement ring.\n\nThe 18-year-old described the ring, which unsurprisingly hails from the 1980s, as \u2018The Sweater Destroyer\u2019.\n\n\u2018This is the ring my dad proposed to my mom with in the late 80s,\u2019 she captioned the photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHaving just turned 18, she had inherited the family heirloom from her mother,\n\nAs you can see, the ring is huge, but also resembles a teeny tiny door knob.\n\nThis curious piece of jewellery certainly brought on a wave of comments.\n\n\u2018What drawer did your dad break that off?\u2019 asked one of the hundreds of users who were quick to have their say.\n\nSome even wondered about what her father was thinking, proposing using this heckin\u2019 chonker.\n\n\u2018Does your dad hate your mom?\u2019 wrote one user.\n\nMany of the comments noted that the ring was officially the \u2018ugliest\u2019 they\u2019d ever seen.\n\n\u2018Ding ding ding we have a winner. This might be the most horrid ring I have ever seen,\u2019 said one Facebook user.\n\n\u2018Ugliest ring I\u2019ve ever seen here. U win,\u2019 another chimed in.\n\nLet\u2019s just hope her parents don\u2019t hear about this one.\n\nMORE: Greggs is giving out free bakes to loyal fans\n\nAD FEATURE: Why supporting your gut is the key to wellness\n\nMORE: Sleeping for nine hours or more each night is linked to dementia\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "In a Facebook group named That's It, I'm Ring Shaming, a woman posted an image of her mother's 1980s engagement ring.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89376590_1570788855.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
