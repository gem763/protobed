How much are we covered for? Are our investments insured?\u201d\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the FDIC, or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is an independent federal agency created by Congress to insure bank deposits. Unfortunately, the reader didn\u2019t specify how their money is invested. They could have cash in a certificate of deposit, or they may own stocks and/or bonds. But David Barr, a spokesperson for the FDIC, pointed out some things this couple should know.\n\nBarr: While banks do sell non-deposit items, they are supposed to disclose that they are not insured. So, if they purchased mutual funds, annuities, etc., from a bank, even if less than $250,000, they would not be insured. Most retirement accounts will be in the form of certificate of deposits (CDs).\n\nRetirement accounts placed in CDs are insured separately from non-retirement deposit accounts at a bank. So, you can have $250,000 in individual accounts or joint accounts and have $250,000 in retirement deposit accounts (CDs) and be fully insured to $500,000.\n\nInsurance works by ownership categories. Each ownership category is insured separately. The four categories are: individual, joint, retirement and trust. Don\u2019t think checking, savings or CDs.\n\nBarr provided an example of how a married couple may be insured.\n\n\u2014 Husband has upward of $250,000 in individual accounts \u2014 checking, savings or CDs\n\n\u2014 Wife has upward of $250,000 in individual accounts \u2014 checking, savings or CDs\n\n\u2014 Husband and wife have upward of $500,000 in joint accounts with each other \u2014 checking, savings or CDs\n\n\u2014 Husband has various retirement CDs for upward of $250,000 (Keogh, IRA, Roth, etc.).\n\n\u2014 Wife has various retirement CDs for upward of $250,000 (Keogh, IRA, Roth, etc.).\n\n\u2014 Husband sets up a revocable trust for the wife as a beneficiary for $250,000.\n\n\u2014 Wife sets up a revocable trust for the husband as the beneficiary for $250,000\n\nTotal FDIC insurance: $2 million.\n\n\u201cNotice, nothing mentioned about mutual funds, annuities, etc.,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThose would be the investment products offered by banks that are not deposit accounts, and thus, not insured by the FDIC, regardless of dollar amount.\u201d\n\nBarr suggested that if you are unsure whether your money is federally insured, use this FDIC tool \u2014 Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator, which helps consumers figure out on a per-bank basis how much of their money (if any) exceeds coverage limits.\n\nHere\u2019s some additional information from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on how your money is protected.\n\n\u2014 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) \u2014 Insures savings accounts, insured money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs). The FDIC insures deposits only. It does not insure securities, mutual funds or similar types of investments that banks and thrift institutions may offer.\n\n\u2014 National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) \u2014 The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) is the federal fund that insures credit union members\u2019 deposits in federally insured credit unions up to $250,000. NCUSIF is backed by the federal government.\n\n\u2014 Securities Investor Protection Corp. (SIPC) \u2014 SIPC, a nonprofit corporation created by Congress, protects investors against the loss of their cash and securities such as stocks and bonds held by a SIPC-member brokerage firm. But there\u2019s a protection limit of $500,000, which includes a $250,000 limit for cash.\n\nPlease note this warning from SIPC: \u201cInvestments in the stock market are subject to fluctuations in market value. SIPC was not created to protect these risks. That is why SIPC does not bail out investors when the value of their stocks, bonds and other investment falls for any reason. Instead, in a liquidation, SIPC replaces the missing stocks and other securities when it is possible to do so.\u201d\n\nInvestors may unknowingly place their cash or securities in the hands of a non-SIPC member, the SEC said. Firms are required by law to tell you if they're not SIPC members. SIPC does not provide protection if you are sold worthless stocks and other securities.\n\nRead: Where money meets faith, bring skepticism\n\nEarlier this year, SIPC launched a more user-friendly site. Here\u2019s where to go: www.sipc.org.\n\nWatch the investor protection video, which further explains how SIPC helps investors when a brokerage firm fails and their money is missing.\n\nRead more:\n\nThree financial experts address retirees\u2019 five most pressing worries about the recession and their retirement funds\n\nYour pension plan benefits may not be as ironclad as you think\n\nYou\u2019ve stopped working.

Read: Here\u2019s why you should make paying off your student loans a priority over saving for retirement\n\nI asked readers to weigh in on managing student loan debt and retirement savings.\n\nCaren of Alexandria, Va., wrote, \u201cI\u2019m a millennial and was able to pay off my student loans early by working multiple jobs, having three roommates, being lucky enough to have received a lot of scholarship and assistantship money as a student, and being lucky enough to work in an industry that offers good salaries and benefits (especially now that I\u2019m well out of entry-level positions). Did paying off my student loans hurt my retirement savings? I don\u2019t believe so; six figures in retirement savings is a pretty good start for being 30 years old. After paying off my student loans, I cut back on shifts at the restaurants but continued working two to three jobs. This allowed me to increase my 401(k) contributions, open IRAs, open other brokerage accounts, pay off my car, travel, and then purchase a condo. I rented the second bedroom out until my significant other moved in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a wake-up moment in my late 20s when I realized that the loan payments I was making only went toward interest, not the overall principal,\u201d wrote Heather from Arlington, Va. \u201cRight then, I was determined to make them go away. I had three loans which were just under $15,000 total. In addition to working full-time at a nonprofit, I did several babysitting gigs (sometimes up to five nights a week), photography gigs, and worked at events to earn extra money, putting it all against the loans. I sold a collection of dolls, which paid off the smallest loan. I won\u2019t lie \u2014 I stressed about these a lot. I missed a lot of out of town weddings, and haven\u2019t been out of the country since I was a teenager. Trips were carefully planned, and I stopped buying extra clothes or stuff I truly didn\u2019t need. If I did spend, it was on experiences. I fully paid off my loans in February of last year. Even now, remembering the timeline, it\u2019s satisfying to go through emails and see the three \u201cPayment Fulfillment\u201d letters I saved. I kept logging back in just in case a small interest payment snuck in or something. I\u2019m still tempted to frame the letters. Retirement-wise, I started my 401(k) three years ago and was sure to contribute enough to get my employer\u2019s 5 percent match. I\u2019ve ticked it up one percent the past two years. I do feel like I missed out a bit on doing it in my 20s, and could have done a Roth IRA, but I\u2019ve started one now, am only 32, and my emergency fund and life happens fund are good. Soon I\u2019ll make a higher contribution to the 401(k), and the money that has gone into the emergency savings will go into the Roth. \u2018Living your best life\u2019 is great and all, but it cannot be at the expense of future debt and the unknown. Was I stressed? Yep. Am I glad they\u2019re gone? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nAnother reader wrote: \u201cI paid off $30,000 in grad school loans in 2017 (two years after graduating in 2015) by selling off a home I had co-owned with my husband for three years. We bought in an area that was quickly developing and luckily made enough to pay off the loans and put forward another down payment for our next home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI definitely pay double the minimum required to make a dent in my student loans, but I make sure not to miss out the compound interest from my contributions to my retirement accounts,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cPut simply, I do both. However, I think it makes more sense to be a little more aggressive in retirement savings because they usually all but guarantee a higher [return] than [the interest paid] on my student loans.\u201d\n\nIf you are an investor, keep in mind that there is no guarantee your money will produce the returns you expect. Yes, past performance of stocks \u2014 depending on the period selected \u2014 will show that equities outperform many other investments. But past performance is no guarantee of future results.\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting read: Five myths about the Great Depression\n\nSubscribe and stay informed\n\nIf you\u2019re viewing this post online, sign up to automatically receive Michelle Singletary\u2019s newsletters right into your email box: \u201cYour Retirement\u201d on Mondays and \u201cPersonal Finance\u201d on Thursdays\n\nRead and share Michelle Singletary\u2019s Color of Money Column on Wednesdays and Sundays in The Washington Post.
