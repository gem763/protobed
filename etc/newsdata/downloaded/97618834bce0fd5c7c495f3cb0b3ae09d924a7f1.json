The plane flew from Salt Lake City to Houston, where girls ages 12 to 18 toured NASA's Mission Control Center, the Johnson Space Center and Space Center Houston.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to the airline, only 5 percent of its pilots are female, which the company says is comparable to others in the aviation industry. The company said the WING flights are among efforts to increase the number of female pilots.\n\nThe airline noted that this year it achieved 100 percent pay parity for female employees in frontline jobs and was also awarded a \"Best Workplace for Women\" by Great Place To Work and Fortune for the third consecutive year.\n\n\"We know representation matters,\" Delta general manager of pilot development Beth Poole said in a press release.\n\n\"At Delta, we believe you have to see it to be it.\"", "description": "A Delta plane\u00a0entirely\u00a0operated by women recently transported 120 girls to NASA headquarters to celebrate International Girls in Aviation Day, which seeks to inspire female aviators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/deltaflight_101219delta.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
