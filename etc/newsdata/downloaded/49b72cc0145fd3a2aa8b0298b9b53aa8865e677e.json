Linick is expected to meet with congressional staff in a secure location on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe unusual nature and timing of the briefing \u2013 during a congressional recess \u2013 suggests it may be connected to a recent intelligence community whistleblower allegation which describes, in part, the State Department\u2019s role in coordinating interactions between Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney, and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThe inspector general is the department's internal investigator and watchdog, and the office generally operates independently of the department's political leadership.\n\nCharles Krupa/AP\n\nThe State Department has faced criticism in recent weeks for connecting Giuliani to multiple Ukrainian officials about re-opening an investigation into for Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe State Department's press office and the State Department's inspector general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
