when streetwear label Supreme teamed up with Louis Vuitton, the designs sold out in a matter of minutes.\n\nSimilar collaborations with popular brand Kith have also produced the same astonishing levels of interest.\n\nAiming high, the team posed a collaboration with 'one of the most influential figures in history': Jesus Christ.\n\nDebate: The shoes have proved to be controversial on social media, with some blasting the concept, while others have praised it as a funny joke\n\n'As a Jew myself, the only thing I knew was that he walked on water,' Greenberg added, revealing how the concept for the sneaker was first born, while explaining that he was actually responsible for sourcing the holy water from a 'friend in Israel'.\n\nThe company then followed the tried and tested practices of so many past fashion collaborations by generating interest and intrigue in their launch through celebrities and influencers, sending just a few pairs out to high-profile social media users ahead of the public release.\n\nMSCHF then debuted the shoes on popular sneaker re-sale website StockX, where they flew off shelves in a matter of minutes, leaving not so much as a sprinkling of holy water in their wake.\n\nUnsurprisingly however, the shoes have stirred up some serious controversy online, with many incorrectly directing abuse over the release at Nike - which did not have any input or involvement in the design of the sneakers.\n\nIn fact, despite Greenberg confirming that MSCHF purchased the original sneakers at retail value, and did not receive them from Nike, many Twitter users blasted the sportswear company, with one even accusing it of 'worshiping the devil'.\n\nOthers simply branded the shoes - and anyone who would pay such a huge amount of money to buy them - 'stupid' and 'ridiculous'.", "description": "The white\u00a0Air Max 97s were redesigned by Brooklyn-based creative label MSCHF, and are not an official release by Nike.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/22/19513436-0-image-a-44_1570657490920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
