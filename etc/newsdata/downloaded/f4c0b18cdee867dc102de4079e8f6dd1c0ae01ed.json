You can get away with it.\"\n\nEmily, who showed off her gorgeous brown locks at the ceremony, confessed her hangovers are \"still surprisingly light\" .\n\nPhillip, who was also at the inspirational event, added: \"You look remarkably good for it.\"\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX)\n\nEmily is baring all in her new book - and admitted some of her family were shocked with how honest she was.\n\nShe said: \"I can't help but spill everything out. It's a good thing I guess. I thought why not spill it all out in a book.\n\n\"The family all read the first copy I did. Everyone was like 'you can\u2019t put that in'. I\u2019m just very honest about things.\n\n\"Growing up, it was chaotic. I lived in a freelance entertainment household. It was really good fun. Was smothered with love. There's so much to tell there. I didn\u2019t have the regular upbringing.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nEmily joked that her family are a \"bunch of show offs\" and she thought it was \"completely normal\" to come home and see Les Dennis in her living room.\n\nBut her showbiz lifestyle did have some negative side effects as she was bullied at school.\n\nShe said: \"I think when you look back, if you\u2019ve been through some kind of bullying, some bullies know they\u2019re bullying. I don't think people now at the time that impact is having on somebody.\"\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nEmily also spoke about her struggles with mental health and how it has impacted her life.\n\nShe added: \"I find people who suffer from depression, it's often the ones with the biggest smiles. If you\u2019re suffering internally you don\u2019t want to believe it sometimes.\n\n\"Growing up it was tough with everybody taking a disliking to me. I looked very different. I hear people say 'get over it' but it does stay with you.\n\n\"Whenever people are in my presence I feel it's a constant thing I want to remind people I\u2019m a good person and I\u2019m not all the things people in school said I was.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The I'm A Celebrity star had limited herself to six drinks at last night's Pride Of Britain Awards - but went a fair few over", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Pa", "David Fisher Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750747.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-29-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
