For starters, she\u2019s avoided like the plague the question about her health care plan and whether it will increase taxes on the middle class. Of course, they will. There\u2019s no way this Democratic action item works without everyone\u2019s taxes going up in exchange for sub-par quality health care. She finally admitted that her Native American heritage claim was straight trash, though she owed it to family stories as the explanation for the mix-up. As Charlemagne tha God of New York\u2019s Breakfast Club noted, Warren is the original Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who faked being black four years ago. Yet, Warren could also face lackluster support from traditionally deep-pocketed donors from within the Democratic Party.\n\nCNBC reported recently that were rumbles that Wall Street Democrats might either withhold donation or even support Trump should Warren win the nomination. In an election year that\u2019s going to be expensive and exceptionally brutal, you need every penny you can put in the war chest. Trump and the GOP are going to have a billion-dollar war chest easy. The Republican National Committee raised $125 million in the third quarter; the Republicans have the small donor army now. So, Warren can either risk losing access to a lot of cash or hold a pow wow with this crew and downplay their concerns that she\u2019s pretty much Lenin in a dress (via CNBC):\n\nDemocratic donors on Wall Street and in big business are preparing to sit out the presidential campaign fundraising cycle \u2014 or even back President Donald Trump \u2014 if Sen. Elizabeth Warren wins the party\u2019s nomination. In recent weeks, CNBC spoke to several high-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community and found that this opinion was becoming widely shared as Warren, an outspoken critic of big banks and corporations, gains momentum against Joe Biden in the 2020 race. \u201cYou\u2019re in a box because you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, \u2018I want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me, so I\u2019m going to help President Trump,\u2019\u201d said a senior private equity executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity in fear of retribution by party leaders. The executive said this Wednesday, a day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump. [\u2026] The business community\u2019s unease about Warren\u2019s candidacy has surged in tandem with her campaign\u2019s momentum. CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said earlier this month that he\u2019s heard from Wall Street executives that they believe Warren has \u201cgot to be stopped.\u201d Warren later tweeted her response to Cramer\u2019s report: \u201cI\u2019m Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message.\u201d Some big bank executives and hedge fund managers have been stunned by Warren\u2019s ascent, and they are primed to resist her. \u201cThey will not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry,\u201d an executive at one of the nation\u2019s largest banks told CNBC, also speaking on condition of anonymity. This person said Warren\u2019s policies could be worse for Wall Street than those of President Barack Obama, who signed the Dodd-Frank bank regulation bill in the wake of the 2008 financial meltdown.\n\nHey, folks, we\u2019re a big tent party\u2014all are welcome. It just shows how the business community knows that Warren and the Democrats could wreck the economy, which has been going strong since 2016. Consumer and small business confidence have reached records highs. Paychecks are bigger. Jobs are being created, over three million thus far. Unemployment hit 3.5 percent under the Trump administration, a 50-year low.\n\nBreaking News: Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!). \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nFor women, the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4percent, the lowest since 1953. And Hispanic unemployment was reduced to 3.9 percent. The previous all-time low for this demographic was 4.8 percent. A sure way to torch all of this: electing a Democrat in 2020, especially Lie-a-Watha Warren.", "description": ".10/04/2019 19:43:32PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/248/1a3beffe-dc66-4752-baae-3f0c2d1c1ce0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
