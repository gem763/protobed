So along with around two dozen other passengers, she complied.\n\nThe captain then ordered all of those who indicated they had been ill to leave the aircraft for a medical check.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Everyone refused, and the Tui representatives relented and said they could re-board the plane.\n\nBut the captain refused to allow them back on the aircraft. Instead she ordered their travelling companions \u2013 including Ruth Williams \u2013 to leave the plane, even if they had shown no symptoms of illness during their holiday.\n\n\u201cTransit cards were taken off us, and the terminal doors were locked,\u201d Ms Williams said.\n\nThe captain then addressed the offloaded passengers. She said that Tui had told her not to carry anyone who might trigger a medical diversion \u201cto another African country\u201d.\n\nYet the 2,800-mile direct route from Boa Vista to Manchester remains well clear of the African mainland. It passes close to the Atlantic islands of Tenerife and Madeira, and near Santiago in northwest Spain.\n\nAfter a further wait for the 47 passengers\u2019 baggage to be removed, the plane took off for the UK three hours late \u2013 and a quarter empty.\n\nThe offloaded passengers were kept in the terminal for five hours, during which they were given two small bottles of water but no food.\n\nEventually they were taken to a local clinic where a doctor would examine them \u2013 free of charge.\n\nEveryone was given a doctor\u2019s note confirming their fitness to fly. This strange formality took place at around 9pm, about the time the plane was due to be landing at Manchester.\n\nThe \u201cBoa Vista 47\u201d were then taken to a local hotel that Ms Williams describes as \u201cdamp and filthy, with mould growing on the walls\u201d.\n\nSome of the group managed to return the following day on a Manchester flight, but Ms Williams and her mother were delayed for two further days.\n\nThey were flown to Gatwick, and put in a taxi for the 230-mile journey to Manchester. Rather than reaching home in Cumbria on Sunday evening, they arrived in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nOthers waited even longer and were flown to Manchester via the nearby island of Sal and Brussels.\n\nA spokesperson for Tui said:\u201cWe can confirm as a precautionary measure any passengers reporting symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis were removed from flight TOM227 before departure from Cape Verde.\n\n\u201cThe passengers were taken to a medical facility and given temporary accommodation until they obtained a fit to fly certificate.\n\n\u201cAlternative flights to the UK were then arranged, along with any transport where necessary.\n\n\u201cThe safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is always our highest priority.\n\n\u201cWe are in contact with all affected customers to apologise for any inconvenience to their holiday.\u201d\n\nMs Williams said: \u201cThe blame lies firmly with Tui, with no regard to customer care being given to ourselves or anyone else involved in this situation.\n\n\u201cThey are not co-operating with us at all, and some people haven\u2019t been contacted at all. We all feel angered and disappointed.\u201d\n\nIt is understood that the offloaded passengers have been offered \u00a31,000 per booking by Tui as \u201ca gesture of goodwill\u201d. But they are considering collective legal action.\n\nIn addition they are entitled to \u20ac600 (\u00a3518) per person in compensation under the European air passengers\u2019 rights rules for being involuntarily offloaded.", "description": "The UK\u2019s biggest holiday company, Tui, ordered 47 customers off a plane home from the Cape Verde islands \u2013 apparently fearful of a medical diversion.
