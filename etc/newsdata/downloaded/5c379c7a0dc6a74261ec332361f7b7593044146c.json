(Photo courtesy of Qui Daugherty)\n\nA 10-year-old girl in Nashville, Tenn., is inspiring people old and young after making a video before going to school \u201cbigger and better\u201d with her natural hair, just one day after she was made fun of for her \u201cafro.\u201d\n\nPromise Sawyers\u2019s motivational video was posted to Facebook by her mom Qui Daugherty, after the 5th grader secretly recorded it on Daugherty\u2019s phone one morning. In it, Sawyers explains that she was feeing \u201csome type of way\u201d after classmates had mean things to say after she wore her natural hair the day before. But she was determined not to let it bring her down, and wore it the same way the following day.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t allow anyone to steal your joy,\u201d Promise said. \u201cDon\u2019t give them that much power.\u201d\n\nNow, nearly 2 million views later, people everywhere are responding to the video and young girl\u2019s empowering words. Daugherty says that Promise has been surrounded by that type of positivity her whole life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s affirmations everywhere,\u201d Daugherty tells Yahoo Lifestyle about the inspirational posters that line her daughter\u2019s bedroom. \u201cNot to mention that I also had kind of wrote her out some affirmations like a year or so ago that I wanted her to say every morning, and so that\u2019s up there.\u201d\n\nDaugherty goes on to explain that she\u2019s always taught her daughter to \u201cmeet a negative with a positive,\u201d even when somebody is trying to bring her down. And although this instance seemed like one of the more disheartening ones that Promise has faced after starting at a new middle school a few weeks prior, her video proved that she took her mom\u2019s advice to heart.\n\n\u201cThe video was made at that point, like she\u2019s really taking a stance,\u201d Daugherty tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe immediate family was more proud of that moment, but we had no idea the impact that it was gonna make and the amount of messages.\u201d\n\nAs of Thursday evening, the video has more than 8,000 comments, with sweet sentiments about Promise, such as: \u201cWow..this young lady is phenomenal,\u201d and \u201cYou are beautiful. Wear your natural crown with pride.\u201d\n\nOthers have praised Daugherty for teaching her daughter positive self-talk writing, \u201cYour mother taught you well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impacted people in so many different ways,\u201d Daugherty says of the comments and direct messages she has received. \u201cIt\u2019s made a huge impact behind the scenes that has blessed me personally.\u201d\n\nStill, Daugherty jokes that Promise doesn\u2019t understand just how influential her words are. Instead, the 10-year-old is just excited about the millions of views.\n\n\u201cI just tell her don\u2019t focus on the numbers,\u201d Daugherty says. \u201cWe\u2019re not focused on the numbers. Let\u2019s find a way we can be impactful behind this and make an influence and inspire people. That\u2019s all we want.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A 10-year-old girl in Nashville got made fun of for wearing her natural hair to school.
