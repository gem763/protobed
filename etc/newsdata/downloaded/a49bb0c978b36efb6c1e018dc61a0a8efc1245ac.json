He also starred in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" franchise.\n\nNow he returns to fantasy in Amazon's new series \"Carnival Row,\" which takes place in a Victorian world where humans and mythical creatures live together. Bloom stars as a detective investigating a serial killer; Cara Delevingne plays a fairy from his past who knows his darkest secret.\n\nActor Orlando Bloom, star of the new series \"Carnival Row.\" CBS News\n\nOn \"CBS This Morning\" Thursday, Bloom said that the period fantasy series intrigued him with its social commentary on today's refugee crisis. \"It's nice to be able to be a part of something that comments a little bit on what's going on in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"When I read the script I really felt, whilst this was a fantasy, I've never read anything like it, I've never seen anything like it \u2026 I play a detective who's investigating the murder of a fairy show girl. The fairies, they really represent the migrants and refugees.\"\n\nThe fairies, pucks and other mythical creatures seeking a safe place are sequestered into Carnival Row. \"It's sort of a dark, interesting thriller-drama, but there's also this beautiful love story between myself and Cara.\"\n\n\"It's your first starring role in a TV series,\" said co-host Anthony Mason. \"Is it different work in any way?\"\n\n\"Honestly, the way that they're making TV today, it really isn't,\" said Bloom. \"The sets were phenomenal. Shot in Prague, the location was fantastic. They had a backlot and it was so detailed and vivid and real. As an actor, that's what you want; you want a great stage so you can give a performance.\"\n\n\"Not in front of a green screen?\"\n\n\"No! They really spared no expense. I think it has sort of felt a little bit like TV was like a little brother to movies at some point, and I think that's kind of \u2013 with the way people stream and can consume content these days \u2013 we're on Amazon Prime now \u2013 you can stream eight hours, and it felt like an eight-hour movie, really.\"\n\nHis character, Inspector Rycroft \"Philo\" Philsotrate, has his secrets. \"He was an interesting man,\" Bloom said. \"He was institutionalized his whole life. He was born in an orphanage and raised, [went] into the army, and then becomes a detective. The secret he has \u2013 I can't give it away obviously \u2013 to me it was like his superpower, because it enables him to become this empathetic being and to have a certain sense of empathy and compassion for the plight of the fairy folk. Which I think is such a wonderful thing to be able to do in a show.\"\n\n\"Carnival Row\" is available on Amazon Prime.

Really well done. Not convinced!\"\n\n\"Really got thrown under a bus there,\" Bloom smiled. \"But I will say that she is really good at doing a faux English accent.\"\n\nMason suggested Perry could bring her faux English accent onto \"Carnival Row\" in a cameo role. \"Have you talked to her about that?\" he asked Bloom.\n\n\"No,\" he laughed. \"But she would be fantastic. She could be an amazing fairy.\"", "description": "New Amazon prime series, a hybrid of fantasy and Victorian-Era mystery, presents fairies and mythical creatures as migrants from a war-torn land", "authors": ["David Morgan"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/05/fdf10995-ede4-408e-8cd1-fb79c5480f26/thumbnail/1200x630/1e0e7abb9fe7cae7e755b13e4536c4d4/carnival-row-orlando-bloom-cara-delevingne-amazon-studios.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
