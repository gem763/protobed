Kamala Harris (D-CA) became the latest politician to \u201cslow jam the news\u201d with Jimmy Fallon and The Roots on Monday\u2019s Tonight Show.\n\nThe 2020 candidate began by giving a condensed version of her case for the presidency after which The Roots\u2019 Black Thought sang, \u201cEver since Barack left, we\u2019ve been off track. But Kamala is trying to get us back to black.\u201d\n\nWhen Harris declared her intention to \u201cget rid of fracking once and for all,\u201d Fallon replied with, \u201cMamala Kamala just don\u2019t give a frack. She took a good look at Mother Earth and decided she\u2019s a MILF: Mother I\u2019d Like to Fix.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to climate she\u2019s a real frontrunner,\u201d The Roots\u2019 lead MC crooned. \u201cShe\u2019s heatin\u2019 up like it\u2019s still Hot Girl Summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the way you work it, K. Higgity. But I gotta ask. Lately this country has been so divided, sleeping on opposite sides of the bed. Why do you think we can\u2019t all just come together?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s my opinion that we need a president who fights for the best of who we are and over the past three years, Donald Trump has done the exact opposite,\u201d Harris replied.\n\n\u201cHold up,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cSo what you\u2019re trying to say is that Trump\u2019s the bad guy?\u201d That question prompted a \u201cduh\u201d from the senator.\n\nLater, Harris predicted that if she does get to debate Trump in the general election, she thinks \u201cit\u2019ll be a competitive face-off where either one of us could end up on top.\u201d When Fallon asked, \u201cReally?\u201d she corrected herself: \u201cNo, I\u2019d wipe the floor with him.\u201d", "description": "\u201cWhen it comes to climate she\u2019s a real frontrunner,\u201d The Roots\u2019 lead MC crooned. \u201cShe\u2019s heatin\u2019 up like it\u2019s still Hot Girl Summer.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_17/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568692523/KH_ggpjt6", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
