The case isn't the first in which tribunal members have been asked to weigh in on the fate of post-breakup jewellery.\n\nBut it is the first involving an extra-marital affair.\n\nFor that reason, Orr felt it would be better to call everyone by their initials.\n\nB.C.'s civil resolution tribunal has been asked to rule on the fate of engagement rings in the past. But a ring for a paramour falls under the 'law of the gift.' (Pressmaster/Shutterstock)\n\n\"Given the sensitive nature of the parties' extramarital relationship, I have anonymized the parties in the published version of the decision to protect the identity of [R.T.'s] wife,\" Orr wrote.\n\nAccording to the ruling, R.T. gave A.L.T. $1,000 cash to buy a diamond ring in December 2017. The total with tax was $1,120. And A.L.T. paid the tax.\n\nThe paramour told the tribunal that the ring was a Christmas gift, a claim her ex-lover didn't dispute. But he insisted that she owed him money.\n\n\"R.T. says that when [his] wife learned of their relationship on March 6, 2019, she demanded that [A.L.T.] return all the gifts she had received from the applicant,\" the ruling says.\n\nA.L.T. initially cut a cheque to the wife for $800, but then was so incensed by the other woman's behaviour and her demand to be compensated for the car repairs that she put a stop-payment order on the money.\n\nThe law of the gift\n\nDisputes over rings tend to centre around recurring legal arguments.\n\nIn previous cases, spurned men have successfully argued that an engagement ring is a form of contract, and that once a wedding was called off, the contract was broken and the ring should revert back to its original owner.\n\nIn one civil resolution tribunal case, a different tribunal member relied on that logic to reject a jilted woman's claim that she should keep her engagement ring because \"she was promised marriage and the [man] broke that promise.\"\n\nYet another tribunal battle skipped the contract debate, turning instead on the fact that the man had used his ex-fianc\u00e9e's credit card to pay for their $3,490 engagement rings.\n\nHe was ordered to pay the money back.\n\nThe diamond ring at the heart of R.T. and A.L.T.'s dispute was obviously not an engagement ring, because he was already married.\n\nOrr instead relied on the \"law of gifts\" which says the burden falls on the person who receives an object to prove it was a gift.\n\nOrr said that she was satisfied that R.T. gave A.L.T. the money \"as a gift to buy the diamond ring.\"\n\n\"There is no evidence this was a loan,\" Orr wrote.\n\nShe also found that the demand for repayment for car repairs was a red herring, saying there was no evidence to support the wife's claim that the girlfriend should repay her husband for his mechanical exertions.", "description": "A generous, but unfaithful, B.C. man has lost his bid to reclaim the cost of a diamond ring he bought his paramour for Christmas.", "authors": ["Jason Proctor Is A Reporter In British Columbia For Cbc News", "Has Covered The B.C.
