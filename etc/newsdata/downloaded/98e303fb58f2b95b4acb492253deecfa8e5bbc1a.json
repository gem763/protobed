He retains plenty of influence, particularly in the central region \u2014 a BDP stronghold \u2014 where he is a traditional chief.\n\n\u2013 Khama \u2018the wild card\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe rift between the president and his predecessor started last year, when Khama resigned near the end of his constitutional limit of two five-year terms.\n\nKhama handed the reins to Masisi in April 2018, 18 months ahead of the next election, as part of the BDP\u2019s carefully crafted process for transferring power.\n\nBut Masisi quickly started reversing several of Khama\u2019s key policies, including lifting his ban on elephant trophy hunting, infuriating his predecessor.\n\nPeter Fabricius, an analyst at the Pretoria-based think tank Institute of Security Studies, said \u201cKhama is the wild card\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is quite a close election and it could go either way,\u201d he added.\n\nMasisi told AFP that Khama\u2019s policies had hurt the ruling party.\n\nThe BDP is \u201cdefinitely going to perform far better\u201d without Khama, Masisi said, predicting an \u201coverwhelming victory, landslide\u201d.\n\nUDC leader Duma Boko was also confident, telling AFP: \u201cI think we will win this election and we should\u201d.\n\nVoter Alice said: \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new government, enough of the BDP\u201d.\n\n\u201cThings are not right in our government\u2026 the corruption is just too much,\u201d she told AFP, asking to be identified only by her first name to protect her job.\n\n\u2013 \u2018We are never going to fight\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe unprecedented political drama has raised fears that Khama\u2019s defection could unsettle Botswana after more than five decades of peace and stability.\n\nBut Masisi ruled out any such scenario, urging everyone to \u201caccept the results\u201d of the vote.\n\n\u201cI have already accepted the results whatever might come,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cBotswana is never going to be in crisis if one person wins or the other doesn\u2019t win, there will be another opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are never going to fight,\u201d Masisi said, adding that stability is in the DNA of Botswana\u2019s people.\n\nBut past elections have never been this close. If the opposition wins, the country\u2019s democratic credentials and reputation for good governance will face a new test \u2014 a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nAnalysts said a BDP loss would be unlikely to send people into the streets. However, they did warn that an unexpected landslide for the ruling party could spark opposition protests claiming the election was rigged.\n\nDuma said at the weekend that the vote would not be free and fair because of unbalanced media coverage by the public broadcaster.\n\nNearly half of Botswana\u2019s 2.2 million people are expected to cast their ballots in the parliamentary and local elections.\n\nThe BDP, UDC and two smaller parties will vie for 57 parliamentary seats. The party with the most seats chooses the president.\n\nThanks to Botswana\u2019s diamond-spurred wealth it is ranked as an upper-middle-income country, but it has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of income inequality.", "description": "Gaborone (Botswana) (AFP) \u2013 Botswana votes on Wednesday in the most closely fought general election in the history of the southern African country,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/21f8db_botswana-president-leader-botswana-democratic-party-bdp-mokgweetsi-masisi-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
