(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nData analyst and political columnist\n\nIn Thursday night\u2019s debate, Juli\u00e1n Castro tried out a potentially fruitful line of attack against poll leader Joe Biden. But he might have bungled the execution.\n\nWhile sparring over the details of health-care policy, Castro repeatedly claimed that Biden had forgotten what he said only two minutes earlier. You can read the transcript here, but the subtext seemed clear: Castro was suggesting that Biden, in his old age, had become more forgetful and less mentally present.\n\nIn my view, Castro came off as overly aggressive. And I\u2019m not sure that his attack will end up damaging Biden\u2019s popularity or increasing his own. But broaching the issue of Biden\u2019s age might have been a smart move in the medium term.\n\nGallup recently tested whether Americans would vote for a presidential candidate if they happened to belong to a specific demographic group \u2014 that is, if they\u2019d vote for a qualified candidate from their party who happened to be gay or lesbian, a woman, black, an atheist, an evangelical, a Catholic or, yes, a septuagenarian. And many voters didn\u2019t like older candidates.\n\nAmong all Americans, only 63 percent said they would vote for a candidate who is older than 70. That\u2019s the third worst of any group Gallup tested \u2014 the only qualities that voters said made a candidate less desirable were atheism or socialism. Voters said they were more willing to vote for a Muslim, a candidate younger than 40, an evangelical Christian, or a gay or lesbian candidate than for an older candidate. Among Democrats, 65 percent said they would vote for a candidate older than 70, making septuagenarians the least popular group Gallup asked about.\n\nBiden\u2019s age \u2014 he\u2019s 76 \u2014 is one of his weaker points in this primary. He seems to have built much of his candidacy on goodwill from the Obama era, perceived electability and relative moderation. He represents a bloc of the Democratic Party that is underrepresented on political Twitter and has (correctly or incorrectly) convinced many Democrats that he has the best chance of beating President Trump. But if Democrats believe that his age is a liability and start to question his electability, he might lose some support.\n\nBeing a little gray isn\u2019t a deal breaker in a presidential primary, or even a general election. Trump is 73, and Hillary Clinton was in her late 60s during the 2016 campaign. Moreover, most Americans say they\u2019re willing to vote for an older candidate.\n\nBut if Biden starts to exhibit some of the negative tropes of aging \u2014 forgetfulness, inability to stay on a topic, lack of physical endurance or mental toughness \u2014 some voters might decide to leave his camp. They might throw their support to a younger candidate, or one of the more spry septuagenarians. If wisdom comes with age, Democrats don\u2019t have to choose between experience and vigor.\n\nRead more:\n\n2020 Power Ranking: The winner of the third debate?
