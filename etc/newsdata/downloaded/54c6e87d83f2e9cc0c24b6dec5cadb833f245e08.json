But you also need to be aware of bias when you\u2019re picking investments.\n\nThe report finds that the order in which investment funds are listed (typically in alphabetical order) \u201csignificantly biases participants\u2019 investment allocation decisions.\u201d The bias is more pronounced when there are a larger number of fund options, but it\u2019s also present when there are \u201crelatively few\u201d funds available.\n\nAccording to the report, the options listed first are chosen more often because of two psychological processes working in tandem: status quo bias and satisficing.\n\nStatus quo bias comes into play because, though investors might be able to reorder their investment options, they typically don\u2019t, and \u201crely on the default list, which is in alphabetical order. Then, they stop looking through funds when they find the first \u201cacceptable\u201d option, regardless of how many options are left to go through, otherwise known as satisficing.\n\n\u201cThus, when a participant searches through her plan\u2019s menu of investment options, she may be more likely to choose the funds appearing towards the beginning of the list,\u201d reads the report. \u201cSince... fund choices with early alphabet names appear at the beginning of the list, they will be chosen more often than later alphabet named funds.\u201d\n\nThis bias is common in any number of decisions, notes Humble Dollar\u2019s Adam Grossman, financial and otherwise. But when it comes to your retirement savings, you could be forfeiting thousands of dollars. Writes Grossman:\n\nTwo companies with expensive funds \u2014 American Funds and American Century \u2014 land at the top of most lists [in the U.S.], while low-cost leader Vanguard Group usually falls near the bottom.\ufeff\n\nWhen selecting funds for your portfolio, keep in mind cost, fees, diversification and performance, among other factors. Most importantly, order the options given to you by expense ratio. That could help you make a better investment decision.", "description": "You already know that many of your financial decisions aren\u2019t made rationally: Recency bias, sunk-cost fallacy and mental accounting all play major roles in how we spend, save and think about our money.
