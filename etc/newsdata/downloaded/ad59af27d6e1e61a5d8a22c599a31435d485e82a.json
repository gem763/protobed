Which is why Yahoo Groups is shutting down and being taken offline for good.\n\nReuters\n\nYahoo Groups, like the rest of Yahoo's tools, is an antique from a different age, one where Google and social media didn't rule the Internet. At the time, it was a place where people would come together to discuss specific TV shows, computers, sports, and a variety of other things. It was almost like Reddit is now, with super specific communities like a recycling effort in one particular town, except updates were disseminated by email.\n\nAfter 18 years, though you can still see a list of all of these groups, but most of them remain inactive. And it's clearly not profitable for Yahoo to keep running them, so they've decided to take Yahoo Groups offline.\n\nDon't Miss 159 K SHARES 38.4 K SHARES 30.6 K SHARES 15.1 K SHARES 5.7 K SHARES\n\nIn fact, the company has announced it's going to be largely shuttering the service in under a week. On October 21, you won't be able to upload new content to groups anymore. And all the stuff stored there is going to vanish into the ether, as Yahoo deletes it all by December 14, including files, links, photos, attachments, and much more.\n\nOnce that old content is deleted, all you'll be able to do on Yahoo Groups is browse the directory and request to join a group. Request, because all currently available public groups will become private. It's likely groups that have been inactive for a long time will just be scrubbed. Oh, and if you're already part of a group you can email people in it of course.\n\nIf you have any content in a group that's dear to you, you can save it. Yahoo says you can download your files directly from the group page or by going to Verizon Media's Privacy Dashboard page, and using your Yahoo account to sign in. Yahoo will email you once your data is ready for download.\n\nAdditionally the Internet Archive, which serves to preserve the history of the Internet, seems to be attempting to save some of the content on Yahoo Groups.\n\nReuters\n\nBut it will probably be no surprise if Yahoo eventually shuts down Groups completely. In 2019, there's not really space online for an antiquated discussion board that happens via email. We're living in the time of message boards and social media now. But you can be sure at least a few old timers will have bittersweet goodbyes to say.", "description": "There was a time when Yahoo was a mainstay of the Internet, what with its Search, Chat, and email functionality.
