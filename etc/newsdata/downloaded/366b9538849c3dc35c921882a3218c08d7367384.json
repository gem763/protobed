As Trysta Krick details, they do have one saving grace. USA TODAY\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2013 Dak Prescott dropped his eyes to the carpet, sighed and shook his head.\n\nHe paced by his stall. He draped his crimson jacket around his shoulders. Two stalls over to his left, tight end Jason Witten faced a half-moon horde of reporters asking about slow starts, injuries and stagnancy in the red zone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, man,\u201d Prescott told USA TODAY Sports by his locker. \u201cWe\u2019re out here trying to get a (expletive) win. We\u2019ve gotta figure this out.\u201d\n\nThat, the Dallas Cowboys do.\n\nJust 40 or so minutes earlier Sunday evening, they had just lost their third game in a row, this one to a previously winless New York Jets team, 24-22. Once again, recurring problems sank the Cowboys\u2019 chances of winning.\n\nThey started slow. Against the Jets, Dallas fell into an early hole, scoring just six points before halftime. That brought their scoring average before intermission during the three-game skid to three points.\n\n\u201cI wish I could give you a better answer, but it\u2019s just execute better on the earlier downs,\u201d Witten told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nMore: 32 things we learned from Week 6 of the 2019 NFL season\n\nNFL: Don't blame the refs \u2014 Browns are responsible for their own meltdown\n\nBut even when Dallas did get in position to score, its drives often stalled. The Cowboys scored touchdowns in just two of their four trips inside the red zone, and worst yet, were one of two in goal-to-go scenarios.\n\nTied closely to the inefficient red zone play are the slow starts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s hurting us,\u201d Prescott told reporters later in a news conference. \u201cWe\u2019re putting ourselves behind. We\u2019re putting our defense in a tough spot and we\u2019re not playing complimentary football. It\u2019s as simple as that. We\u2019ve got to start faster. We have to get points. We have to get touchdowns and allow our defense to play from (ahead). As long as we keep having these slow starts and getting in our own way, we\u2019re going to struggle.\u201d\n\nA 16-point second half brought the Cowboys near a comeback, but the attempt failed when the Jets blitzed during a failed two-point conversion in which Prescott barely had enough time to get off a pass to Witten.\n\nPerhaps nothing better encapsulated Dallas\u2019 issues than a sequence in the middle of the second quarter. The Cowboys marched to the Jets' 6-yard line. Facing a third-and-1, running back Ezekiel Elliott was stuffed for a loss of 1. Then, on fourth-and-2, offensive coordinator Kellen Moore dialed up a designed rush for Prescott to the left. He lost 2 yards and Dallas turned the ball over on downs.\n\nOn the following play, Jets receiver Robby Anderson cooked Cowboys corner Chido Awuzie with a double move. Darnold slid up the pocket and lofted a pass just out of the reach of safety Jeff Heath, who dove to the turf. Heath slowly propped himself up onto his knees and could only watch as Anderson scampered into the end zone for a 92-yard touchdown, the longest score from scrimmage in the NFL all season and the second-longest in team history.\n\nIt put the score at 14-3 and gave New York a comfortable cushion that it rode throughout the game.\n\n\u201cThat was not a good stretch for us in the ball game,\u201d coach Jason Garrett said. \u201cUltimately, we did a good job coming back in the second half and giving ourselves a chance to win the ball game at the end, but we didn\u2019t do enough to win it for 60 minutes.\u201d\n\nEven in the second half, Dallas couldn\u2019t overcome self-inflicted errors.\n\nA 4-yard Witten touchdown that materialized with 8:02 left in the third quarter was negated by offensive pass interference. Two plays later, the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal.\n\nThe Cowboys were, however, significantly shorthanded. The team declared left tackle Tyron Smith (ankle), right tackle La\u2019el Collins (MCL sprain) and receiver Randall Cobb (back/hip) \u2013 all of them starters \u2013 inactive before the game. Then, after star receiver Amari Cooper appeared to be slightly hobbled during the team\u2019s opening series, the Cowboys kept him on the sideline and later ruled him out with a quad injury.\n\nThough the Cowboys did rush for 129 yards, they required 34 carries to get there.\n\n\u201cWe practice this a lot, to make sure that everyone is ready in a situation like this,\u201d center Travis Frederick told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cBut it is difficult. Those guys are starters for a reason. Those guys did a nice job on the outside as far as I know, but we\u2019ll go back and make sure that everyone is on the same page moving forward so that we can get better from this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a common issue that has plagued Dallas. In victories, Elliott has averaged 5.3 yards per carry. In losses, after Elliott ran 28 times for 105 yards and a score against the Jets, he averages 3.5.\n\nGarrett said he was \u201cmindful\u201d of adjusting his play calling with two backup tackles in the game.\n\nAnother issue for the Cowboys without their two starting tackles was a constant pass rush. The Jets hit Prescott eight times and sacked him once.\n\nYet all is not in peril. The Cowboys (3-3), despite the slump, are still in a first-place tie atop the NFC East with the Philadelphia Eagles. Their wounded starters are on the mend and should be nearing their respective returns.\n\nAnd before it heads into its Week 8 bye, Dallas has the chance to take control of the division with a Sunday night showdown at home looming against the Eagles.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can say it is a season-defining game, but we\u2019re still tied for the lead in our division, so we\u2019ve just got to go out there and get a win,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cNext week is a must-win.\u201d\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
