MEPs will hold confirmation hearings for each nominee.\n\nBased in Brussels, the Commission is in charge of enforcing EU rules and the bloc's treaties. It is the only EU body that can draft laws.\n\nMrs von der Leyen, Germany's former defence minister, will officially replace Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November.\n\nThe new executive team of 27 - one for each member state - is planned to be in place for five years.\n\nBBC reporter Adam Fleming says the appointments are considered hugely significant in Brussels - akin to the Oscars film awards - with national pride at stake.\n\nMrs von der Leyen's list features some new posts within the Commission, but who are the key players?\n\nPhil Hogan (Ireland)\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nNominee for Trade Commissioner\n\nIn his current role as EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, the former Irish government minister has criticised the UK government's attitude during Brexit negotiations and what he has called the \"tough guy approach\" of some \"Brexiteers\".\n\nMr Hogan described what he said was Britain's poor grasp of the importance of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border issue as \"disheartening\". He has warned the UK that it faces \"a huge gap between hope and experience\" when it begins operating its own trade policy.\n\nEarlier this year, the 59-year-old warned plans published by the UK government for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit were an attempt \"to break EU unity\" over the Irish border issue.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mrs von der Leyen described Mr Hogan as an \"excellent\" negotiator, adding that he will be \"very fair but determined\".\n\nMargaritis Schinas (Greece)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNominee for Vice-President and Protecting Our European Way of Life\n\nKnown to be extremely careful about what he does and does not say, the current EU Commission spokesman and member of Greece's ruling centre-right party New Democracy has been outspoken about Brexit.\n\nMr Schinas, 57, has pushed the UK to provide \"clarification\" on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain following the country's exit from the union.\n\nHe has also said that in a no-deal scenario, it would be \"pretty obvious\" that there would be a hard border on the island of Ireland - meaning checks on people and goods.\n\nIf approved for the role, Mr Schinas will oversee migration, security, employment and education.\n\nFrans Timmermans (Netherlands)\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nNominee for Executive Vice-President for European Green Deal\n\nCurrently First Vice-President of the Commission, the centre-left politician has already shown a preparedness to tackle the climate crisis, helping to steer through EU legislation banning plastic straws.\n\nThe multilingual 58-year-old could now see himself helping to implement further environmental policies, which will be at the heart of the EU's agenda for the next five years.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first \"climate-neutral\" continent\n\nHe has also previously negotiated the EU's 2016 deal with Turkey to reduce the flow of migrants and has warned of the risks of nationalism.\n\n\"People who used to vote for my party and many parties here are now voting for nationalist parties, sometimes even extremist parties. That's our fault,\" he said in June.\n\nMargrethe Vestager (Denmark)\n\nImage copyright EPA\n\nNominee for Executive Vice-President, Europe Fit for the Digital Age\n\nA big name in Danish politics, Ms Vestager has spent the past five years as EU competition commissioner, spearheading EU anti-trust investigations that have ended in big fines for US technology giants Google and Apple.\n\nHer nomination may cause technology firms to sit up and take note. She has already earned the wrath of US President Donald Trump: \"Your tax lady, she really hates the US,\" he is reported to have told her boss, Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\nBut she believes companies must pay their way.\n\nMs Vestager, 51, is a member of the European liberal group Renew Europe. She gained ground in the European elections earlier this year and was among the nominees for Mrs von der Leyen's role.\n\nShe has previously served as Denmark's economy and interior minister.\n\nWho else is on the list?\n\nJohannes Hahn (Austria), Budget and Administration; Didier Reynders (Belgium), Justice; Mariya Gabriel (Bulgaria), Innovation and Youth; Dubravka Suica (Croatia), Democracy and Demography; Stella Kyriakides (Cyprus), Health; Vera Jourova (Czech Republic), Values and Transparency; Kadri Simson (Estonia), Energy; Jutta Urpilainen (Finland), International Partnerships; Sylvie Goulard (France), Internal Market; Laszlo Trocsanyi (Hungary), Neighbourhood and Enlargement; Paolo Gentiloni (Italy), Economy; Valdis Dombrovskis (Latvia), An Economy that Works for People; Virginijus Sinkevicius (Lithuania), Environment and Oceans; Nicolas Schmit (Luxemburg), Jobs; Helena Dalli (Malta), Equality; Janusz Wojciechowski (Poland), Agriculture; Elisa Ferreira (Portugal), Cohesion and Reforms; Rovana Plumb (Romania), Transport; Maros Sefcovic (Slovakia), Relations and Foresight; Janez Lenarcic (Slovenia), Crisis Management; Josep Borrell (Spain), A Stronger Europe in the World; Ylva Johansson (Sweden), Home Affairs.", "description": "Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen names most gender-diverse executive team in the bloc's history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/12929/production/_108737067_ursula_von_der_leyen_2_epa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
