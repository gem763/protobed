Ammar Awad\n\nPrior to her departure, Lam reiterated that her \"first priority\" was ending the violence that has dealt a body blow to the local economy as well as Hong Kong's reputation as a safe, law-abiding center for finance and business with a sophisticated independent judiciary.\n\nLam said she was working with the city's 180,000 public servants and transport authorities to restore order, although that task was made harder by members of the public sympathetic to the cause of the \"rioters,\" as she termed the hard-core protesters.\n\nHowever, she was forced to withdraw amid calls for her resignation, with pro-democratic legislator Claudia Mo shouting, \"Carrie Lam, you are a liar.\"\n\nThe protests began in response to a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent for trial in Communist Party-controlled courts in mainland China.\n\nThe movement then ballooned to encompass broader clamors for universal suffrage, an independent inquiry of the policing methods used against protesters and other demands, including ending the description of protesters as \"rioters.\"\n\nSham has been one of the public faces of the protest movement as a leader of the Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized large demonstrations. He was on his way to an evening meeting in the district of Kowloon when four or five attackers pounced on him, leaving him with bloody head injuries but conscious, the Front said on its Facebook page.\n\nIt suggested the assault was politically motivated, linked \"to a spreading political terror in order to threaten and inhibit the legitimate exercise of natural and legal rights.\"\n\nMo and other opposition legislators on Thursday suggested the attack on Sham may have been designed to frighten others away from protesting, or even to help provide a pretext for the government to call off district council elections scheduled for next month.\n\nA pro-democracy lawmaker is escorted by security from the Legislative Council, as Hong Kong\\'s Chief Executive Carrie Lam takes questions from lawmakers regarding her policy address, in Hong Kong, China Oct. 17, 2019.

Sham was not injured in that attack.", "description": "Pro-democracy lawmakers shouted and waved placards depicting Lam with bloodied hands, prompting their removal by guards and the suspension of proceedings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4239550/1000x563_nbc-191017-hong-kong-mc-9283_0732d4c21a38fcb01e38f9608c33ee67.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
