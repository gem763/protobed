Does the secret system described in the complaint actually contain records about other presidential phone calls with foreign leaders that resemble Trump's talk with Zelenskiy? What did Trump say?\n\nTrump has vowed to be transparent about the Ukraine affair. He volunteered on Wednesday to release records about two other phone calls with Ukrainian leaders involving himself and Vice President Pence.\n\nTrump also has suggested that he might not object to his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, speaking with congressional committees about the central role he has played in the outreach to Ukraine.\n\nPolitics Rudy Giuliani's Role In Trump Ukraine Call Rudy Giuliani's Role In Trump Ukraine Call Listen \u00b7 4:01 4:01\n\nBut if past is prologue, the White House may not be eager to cooperate much more with what Trump and his supporters call Democrats' new \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe administration has not given Congress documents or access to witnesses in response to many of its earlier requests involving the Russia investigation, Trump's business dealings and more.\n\nThe president's supporters have dismissed the Ukraine flap as another \"information warfare operation\" against the president.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the disputes between the House and the administration are still playing out in court after committees filed suit for the relevant materials.\n\nWhat isn't clear is whether the theoretically greater stakes of the Ukraine matter \u2014 which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats have made the focus of what they say is an impeachment inquiry \u2014 may prompt Trump to change his tune.\n\nThe White House already has invoked executive privilege \u2014 the doctrine that permits an administration to shield some of its internal workings from public view \u2014 in keeping some witnesses and materials from Congress.\n\nThe investigation that Schiff and his colleagues now want to pursue involves the internal workings of the White House, discussions of the National Security Council and other aides, diplomats and others all squarely within the executive branch.\n\nIf Giuliani, who has been working for Trump but not the government, isn't covered by executive privilege, many of the other people involved may be.\n\nExecutive privilege already has been the subject of internal debates involving the whistleblower case, acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire told Schiff's committee on Thursday.\n\nAre Pelosi and Schiff about to drive into a wall they'll be unable to breach? Or will the putative threat of impeachment prompt Trump to open the gates?\n\nThe red wall\n\nTrump may remain confident that in the event of actual impeachment proceedings \u2014 which would involve the equivalent of an indictment in the House and then lead to his trial in the Senate \u2014 he'd continue to enjoy the support of enough Republicans to retain the presidency.\n\nThat has been the assumption by Republicans thus far, and as Washingtonians headed to work on Friday morning, the red wall in the Senate still appeared robust.\n\nAt times, the president and his supporters have appeared to want to dare Democrats to go ahead with impeachment with the knowledge that they would lose, betting that the fallout actually would wind up weakening Pelosi and her members and strengthening Trump and Republicans.\n\nBefore this week, Pelosi seemed to read these politics in the same way and sought to rein in the most aggressive Democrats in the chamber. Then the accounts of Trump's conduct broke the dam for so many of her members that the speaker joined them on Tuesday under the aegis of the I-word.\n\nBut Pelosi also hasn't spelled out what, precisely, she, Schiff and her other top lieutenants actually may do differently, nor has she made clear how far Democrats are prepared to go.\n\nThat has put the speaker in an uncertain new standoff with the president, and the next phase in this melodrama may depend on who's the first one to blink.", "description": "Washington is closing out a week that included a vortex of developments involving President Trump, Congress and the 2020 election.
