There is one nation uniquely situated to do all three: the United States.\n\nOur technology and our environmental laws are among the strongest and most advanced in the world. That is why from 2007 through May of this year (the most recent data available), average monthly U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased by nearly 13 percent (a reduction of over seven-and-a-half billion metric tons over that time) \u2014 even as United States energy production increased. Global energy-related CO2 emissions, in comparison, increased roughly 15 percent.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more: Since 1990, total methane emissions from natural gas systems have fallen 18 percent while production has increased 55 percent. From 1990 to 2018, annual emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants fell by over 90 percent while emissions of nitrogen oxides fell by over 80 percent. And in the past decade alone, mercury emissions from power plants have decreased by nearly 90 percent.\n\nThe United States is now the number one oil and gas producer in the world. Yet, our air continues to get cleaner. From 1970 to 2018, the combined emissions of the six criteria pollutants dropped 74 percent (and emissions of all criteria pollutants continued to decline from 2016 to 2018). According to World Health Organization data, the United States has some of the lowest fine particulate matter levels in the world, more than five times below the global average, seven times below Chinese levels, and well below France, Germany, Mexico and Russia.\n\nWhen it comes to supplying affordable and reliable energy in a manner that protects human health and the environment, the United States is the standard-bearer.\n\nThose who oppose U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuel production, are actually taking one of the most environmentally preferable energy sources off the table for the rest of the world.\n\nWe can\u2019t deny that fossil fuels will continue to be an integral part of the world\u2019s energy needs. Fossil fuels met nearly 70 percent of the global increase in energy demand; renewables were about 25 percent.\n\nRather than turning our back on our own resources and yielding the marketplace to China or Russia, we should want cleaner, more reliable American coal, oil and natural gas to power more homes and businesses throughout the world.\n\nThis is precisely what President Trump and his Administration are focused on.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency recently took action to accelerate the construction of pipelines and other important energy infrastructure projects. Section 401 of the Clean Water Act gives states a say in federally approved projects that would impact state water resources. Many states implement Section 401 faithfully. However, some do not. Some use it to kill projects altogether \u2014 and sometimes for reasons totally unrelated to water quality. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo used it to veto an important natural gas pipeline, for example. We issued a proposal to prevent state leaders from misusing their Section 401 authority to block critically important infrastructure.\n\nWe\u2019re also lifting duplicative and unnecessary regulatory burdens off the backs of America\u2019s energy producers through our recent methane rule. The previous administration imposed methane regulations that we believe are duplicative, unnecessary and not appropriate under the Clean Air Act.\n\nFinally, our Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule puts an end to the job-killing Clean Power Plan. We are regulating CO2 emissions from the electric power sector in a manner that upholds the law and the relevant Supreme Court decisions and does not stifle innovation.\n\nCoal use is rising worldwide, driven in large part by India, China and other Asian nations. Rather than punishing the United States\u2019 production of coal, the ACE rule levels the playing field and encourages the development of cleaner technologies across the sector. These technologies can then be exported to other countries to improve the worldwide environment.\n\nThe world is using more energy. And someone is going to supply it. It could be China; it could be Russia; or it could be the United States \u2014 the cleaner, more reliable source.\n\nIf we truly care about improving lives and improving environmental outcomes, we should be strengthening domestic production and exporting American energy and cleaner technologies far and wide. That is what President Trump is doing. Under his watch, the United States became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time in nearly 60 years.\n\nThis progress will continue, and the world will be better for it.\n\nAndrew R. Wheeler is the 15th Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
