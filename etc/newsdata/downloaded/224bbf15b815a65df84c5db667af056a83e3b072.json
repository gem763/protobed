Pictures do not do it justice.\"\n\nLisa said she dropped Connie-Mae off off at 9.30am that day and received a phone call at 9.47am.\n\nShe added: \"I was told that I didn't need to rush as she was fine and so I arrived approximately 30 minutes after the phone call.\n\n\"If I had known how bad it was I would have got a taxi to her straight away.\n\n\"I arrived at the nursery around 10.30am and was told that Connie's injury was worse earlier and that it had gone down.\n\n\"They also informed me that Connie had slept for 15 minutes following the accident.\n\nThe girls mum claims no one had administered medication or first aid.\n\nLisa said she and her partner David Hayden, 39, returned to the nursery later to discuss the accident with staff and to view the CCTV footage.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nShe said: \"Connie was unattended for at least a minute and it took 14 seconds for them to notice she'd fallen.\n\n\"She had pulled herself up the back of the bookcase and when she got to the top it tipped and landed on her.\n\n\"It looked as if she may have climbed it before or seen another child do so as she seemed to know what she was doing.\n\n\"I wanted to watch the CCTV to see what happened. I saw her climb the bookcase, hit her head and then it fell.\n\n\"I can't say if she was trapped under the bookcase because I had to look away.\n\n\"I'm pregnant now and I was in bits. I couldn't watch it, it was horrible.\n\n\"When your little girl is in someone else's care you expect them to be safe, even more so in a nursery.\n\n\"Before I had nothing but praise for the nursery. Connie was settled and had friends there.\"\n\nJason Ashcroft, who owns and manages the nursery, has apologised to Lisa and said an investigation was underway.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nHe said: \"We are entrusted with the safety of over 300 children, and that includes in many cases, the children of our own employees, including my own son, who is of a very similar age.\n\n\"With that trust, we must accept complete responsibility for any accidents that occur on our premises.\n\n\"This is why we go to extraordinary lengths to ensure each and every child is safe and surrounded by highly-trained and qualified staff, who have the experience to deal with any situation that may occur.\n\n\"There are however, times when accidents happen, and as the founder and owner of the nursery, it is my responsibility to ensure that they occur as infrequently as possible and that all staff know what the protocols and procedures are, should an accident occur and that they follow them to the letter.\"\n\nHe said he had spoken with Miss Roberts and \"apologised unreservedly\" for what happened and explained he had taken \"total responsibility\".\n\nMr Ashcroft also said the nursery had contacted Ofsted and said they had removed the bookcase and contacted the manufacturer to find out why it might have collapsed.\n\nHe added: \"All staff throughout the setting have been interviewed and reminded of their responsibilities to the children and left under no illusion as to how seriously we take an incident of this nature, and that following the investigation, disciplinary action will be taken, should it be deemed that anyone responded in anything other than a totally professional manner.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Miss Roberts and her daughter have suffered as a result of this accident, however we are extremely pleased that the little girl in question, is making a swift and full recovery.\"\n\nA spokesman for Ofsted said: \"We don't comment on complaints.\n\n\"However, we take all complaints we receive very seriously and assess them thoroughly to see whether further action is needed.\"", "description": "Little Connie-Mae Sherratt's mum claims her daughter \"could have died\" after she became pinned underneath the bookcase", "authors": ["Steve Creswell", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20704732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_CONNIE_BOOKCASE_01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
