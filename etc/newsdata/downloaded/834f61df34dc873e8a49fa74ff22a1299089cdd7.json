Given that menopause is nonreproductive by definition, biologists consider it a \u201cbig evolutionary puzzle,\u201d the novelist Darcey Steinke writes in her memoir, Flash Count Diary: Menopause and the Vindication of Natural Life. According to the prevailing view, a human female possesses all the eggs she will have while still in the womb; the number promptly begins diminishing, and by her mid-40s, the remaining ova have deteriorated. To an evolutionary biologist, this is interesting and weird. To Steinke, it was miserable and hard. Her book is lyrical but a bit depressing, because she herself was depressed.\n\nSome women experience few symptoms during menopause, but Steinke suffered nearly two awful years of hot flashes, acute episodes that were like \u201cfour-minute surprise anxiety attacks\u201d. She sensed mortality stalking her: \u201cFor the first time, I feel I have a time-stamp, an expiration date.\u201d She writes vividly and a little wistfully about sex, mourning her lost desirability, as she sees it, and the waning of her own desire. She feels angry; she yells at her husband. \u201cEarly times of sexual frenzy seem almost impossible now.\u201d\n\nThe wild matriarchs have given me hope. They are neither frail nor apprehensive, but in every way leaders of their communities. \u2014 Darcey Steinke, novelist\n\nEvery woman is of course entitled to \u2013 and can\u2019t escape \u2013 her own response to menopause. But Steinke\u2019s melancholy reflections sound a bit retrograde, as if she can\u2019t escape those insufferable doctors, the Wilsons and the Reubens, with their pompous pronouncements about the wreckage that remains when estrogen, like a tide, drains away. \u201cWithout hormones my femininity is fraying,\u201d she writes. In a transitional state herself, she identifies with people who are transitioning out of their birth gender \u2013 not that the empathy brings much relief.\n\nSteinke also identifies with one of the few other species that enjoy a long postmenopausal life: killer whales. In the ocean, nonreproductive females play an important role. With the wisdom of years, they guide their pod to the best salmon. Steinke kayaks in waters off the coast of Seattle, hoping to commune, and is rewarded with a magnificent breaching. \u201cThe wild matriarchs have given me hope,\u201d she writes. \u201cThey are neither frail nor apprehensive, but in every way leaders of their communities.\u201d\n\nThat menopause may enable a new role and stature for women is the central argument of The Slow Moon Climbs: The Science, History, and Meaning of Menopause, by Susan Mattern. A historian at the University of Georgia, she steps away from the personal to consider \u201chumanity\u2019s massive primeval past.\u201d Once upon a time, scientists assumed that women (and men) were designed to live to about 50, and that menopause was an accident, a by-product of medical progress. Yet even in primitive societies, it turns out, a portion of women lived well past middle age, which suggests that menopause is a feature, not a bug, of human evolution.\n\nA Hadza grandmother out foraging.\n\nMattern has her own audacious theory as to why: menopause is a key to our success as a species. In humanity\u2019s hunter-gatherer days, tribes needed a balance of producers and consumers \u2013 people who brought in food, and people who ate it. Most adults did both. Not so children, who remain dependent during the long period of brain development. Members who could bring in food for more than one person without adding to the population were crucial.\n\nEnter the postmenopausal female. The anthropologist Kristen Hawkes studied a modern foraging tribe, the Hadza, and found that an energetic group of older women brought \u201cmore food into camp than any other age and sex category.\u201d This paved the way for the Grandmother Hypothesis: not only do older women serve as food producers, but they are providers of \u201callocare,\u201d communal childcare. In the Hadza and other tribes, Mattern writes, women \u201creach peak foraging productivity in their 50s and continue to produce a caloric surplus through old age\u201d. She points out that tribes have been known to kill members who can\u2019t contribute. If grandmothers aren\u2019t murdered, she reasons, that is because they are useful.\n\nMattern makes the case that menopause probably emerged in humans when we diverged from chimpanzees millions of years ago. It gave Homo sapiens an advantage over other species of hominids such as Neanderthals and Denisovans, she proposes. Limiting childbearing to younger women, whose offspring could be cared for by older women, enabled the species to bounce back from an epidemic or a crisis: those fertile women could reproduce quickly, but no woman could do so forever, sparing the tribe the risk of overpopulation. With the advent of farming, menopause still served an important purpose. The most prosperous time for a peasant family was postmenopausal, Mattern argues, when older children could help and the family no longer had new members to support. Nowadays, with fewer children and more resources, she brightly adds, \u201cwomen past menopause, who historically used their energy surplus to help their families survive, can now use it in other ways\u201d. While Steinke experienced menopause as a shutting-down, Mattern sees it as an opening-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth views are true, as The New York Times columnist Gail Collins shows in No Stopping Us Now: The Adventures of Older Women in American History, which spans the colonial era to the present. Her takeaway is that older women fare well when circumstances permit them to be productive: \u201cIf you\u2019re important economically, you\u2019re important.\u201d Providing allocare is well and good, but \u201ceras in which older women were able to earn money or increase their family assets were eras in which they were \u2026 popular,\u201d Collins writes drily.\n\nTracing their shifting status, she observes that during the colonial period, women continued spinning, weaving, and the like into old age. Physically, of course, the stage could be hell \u2013 pelvic disorders, childbirth damage, rotting teeth. Older enslaved women were exiled and horribly neglected. Yet often, the only thing worse than being a woman was being a man: male mortality was higher, and widowhood could be a blessing \u2013 in the United States, widows, at least white ones, could own property (unlike married women). Then, as the country became more populated, men monopolised the jobs. Women had less of an economic purpose, and they lost status.\n\nImportant strides were made by female workers who filed class-action lawsuits protesting rules that obliged them to retire if they married.\n\nCollins highlights the great age of social reform in the mid-19th century as another period when older women enjoyed prestige, though less because they had economic power than because they wielded moral authority. Notably, they used that authority to make the case for, among other things, female clout well into later life. A standout among women\u2019s rights advocates, Elizabeth Cady Stanton argued that women could occupy different spheres at different life stages, moving from narrow domestic concerns to community-minded platforms. Stanton, Collins writes, \u201cbelieved that menopause had redirected all her \u2018vital forces\u2019 from her reproductive organs to her brain\u201d. Vital she and Susan B. Anthony certainly were as they barnstormed the country, made speeches on tabletops, played cards with soldiers. Their age allowed them to \u201chave adventures\u201d. At the same time, one observer wrote, \u201cstately Mrs Stanton has secured much immunity by a comfortable look of motherliness\u201d.\n\nAs the white-collar workplace expanded in the industrial era, women were shouldered out of it, eroding female social power across the age range. Older black women were a mainstay of early civil-rights struggles, but the contributions of activists such as Mary Church Terrell and Mary McLeod Bethune were sidelined, the credit given to younger men. And women\u2019s return to the workforce during World War II gave way to postwar pressure to depart it, which delivered mixed results for older women. In the 1960s and \u201970s, important strides were made thanks to female workers such as flight attendants, who filed class-action lawsuits protesting against rules that obliged them to retire if they married or reached age 35. Yet as women\u2019s earning potential grew along with their work span and sexual freedom, the more senior among them faced newly corrosive pressures.\n\nThe sex books are right: men aren\u2019t as picky about women\u2019s bodies as women fear.\n\nIt may not be a coincidence that Wilson, Reuben, and their ilk pushed the perils of \u201cthe menopause\u201d during this era. The centrality of sexual liberty to the women\u2019s movement arguably left second-wave feminists more vulnerable to insecurity about their bodies and looks. Susan Mattern proposes that the very concept of a menopausal syndrome was the invention of a culture that aimed to psychologically weaken women in a strong period of life \u2013 at a historical moment when female power was rising. \u201cDominant groups,\u201d she observes, \u201ccan be very creative in inventing new ways of oppressing people\u201d.\n\nYet I\u2019m struck, reading these accounts, that Stanton intuited what remains true today: women have a different life trajectory than men, and the place of menopause in it is liberating in a way that\u2019s worth considering. To describe a passage of life, even a painful one, can itself be a form of empowerment. Men, too, feel loss and insecurity as they age, and perhaps could use a map of sorts themselves. Crossing the midlife point, many struggle to recalibrate professional ambition (as Arthur Brooks\u2019s article in The Atlantic\u2019s July issue revealed) and to build stronger social and intimate ties. Online-dating sites betray men\u2019s own anxiety about physical decline (\u201cMy friends say I look much younger than 60!\u201d) and suggest that many men are perfectly willing to date women across the age range.\n\nThe sex books are right: men aren\u2019t as picky about women\u2019s bodies as women fear. Men crave sex, but they also crave conversation, a partner with confidence and achievements. Even Simone de Beauvoir changed her mind. In The Coming of Age, a book about the experience of getting older, she wrote that she had crossed a \u201cfrontier\u201d and found peace. She had also taken a younger lover. \u201cIt has been far less sombre,\u201d she reported, \u201cthan I had foreseen\u201d.", "description": "Many women spend early middle age constrained by work-life challenges, like athletes training with ankle weights.
