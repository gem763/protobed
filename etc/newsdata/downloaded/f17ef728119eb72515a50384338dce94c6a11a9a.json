He then invited China to do the same \u2014 \u201cbecause what happened in China was just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nTrump has never specified what he thinks Biden did. He has, however, engaged in a globe-spanning effort to get others to find out. It bears repeating that federal law prohibits soliciting anything of value from foreigners to aid an election campaign. But more to the point: Trump is making it abundantly clear that he intends to keep abusing his power to advance his personal interests. Congress can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, accept that.\n\nThe rough transcript of the phone call revealing that Trump had cajoled the president of Ukraine to dig up dirt on Biden \u2014 possibly in return for military aid that Trump had held up \u2014 was disturbing. But the information that has come out since \u2014 both from the whistle-blower and those directly involved in the situation \u2014 is far worse.\n\nIt\u2019s now clear that the phone call was part of a broader campaign. Trump also dispatched his personal lawyer to discuss Biden with the Ukrainians, removed a career diplomat who raised questions about the scheme, then enlisted two State Department envoys to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to commit to investigating Biden in return for an audience with Trump \u2014 and perhaps, again, for military aid.\n\nAn exchange of text messages between Gordon Sondland, an ambassador tasked with carrying out Trump\u2019s plan, and Bill Taylor, a diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine who raised concerns about it, makes the dynamic plain enough:\n\n[9/1/19, 12:08:57 PM] Bill Taylor: Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\n\n[9/1/19, 12:42:29 PM] Gordon Sondland: Call me\n\nTrump has barely bothered to establish an innocent explanation for these acts. Given the facts, it\u2019s hard to imagine one. If he thought that Biden\u2019s conduct constituted a crime, he could\u2019ve allowed his Justice Department to handle it. If he discovered a previously unexpressed interest in fighting corruption overseas, he could\u2019ve directed the State Department to make that a priority.\n\nIt would be fair game to ask whether Biden\u2019s son Hunter unduly benefited from his father\u2019s position in his business dealings, as some have alleged. But under no circumstances would it be appropriate for the president to send his lawyer on a freelance mission to ask other governments to investigate in return for personal favors.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s stalwart allies are struggling with this one: They\u2019ve been reduced to quibbling with semantics or musing about bureaucratic conspiracies to frame the president.\n\nImpeachment is never something to be celebrated. It risks doing grave damage to public confidence in government and worsening America\u2019s already polarized politics. An election that cast Trump from office would be the soundest and most enduring rebuke to this presidency.\n\nNevertheless, Congress cannot stand by while any president violates his oath of office, abuses his power for personal gain and solicits foreign interference in American elections. Even in an administration where the reigning ethical standard is \u201cnot technically illegal,\u201d this flagrant misconduct stands out.\n\nMore Republicans should follow Senator Mitt Romney\u2019s lead and state unequivocally that this kind of conduct is \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d \u2014 and further, it cannot be countenanced.\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net\n\nMichael R.
