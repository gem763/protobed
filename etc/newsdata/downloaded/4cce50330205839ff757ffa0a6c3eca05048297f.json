Johnson prepares Brexit bill battle", "language": "en", "text": "London (AFP) \u2013 Sterling steadied around $1.29 Friday as dealers took a breather at the end of a dizzying week and on the eve of a vital vote on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nThe stage was set for the House of Commons, which is to meet for the first time on a Saturday in 37 years for a knife-edge vote.\n\nThe spotlight in Europe then turns towards Sunday evening, when markets in Asia will deliver their initial verdict on the outcome \u2014 and the potential for a chaotic Brexit on October 31.\n\nJohnson has vowed Britain will exit the bloc that day come what may.\n\nIMF head Kristalina Georgieva urged caution while welcoming signs that Britain can reach a deal to exit the European Union.\n\n\u201cWhen there is a will, there is a deal\u2026 and my hope is that the will holds in all quarters,\u201d Georgieva told reporters at the start of the International Monetary Fund annual meeting.\n\n\u201cThe market (is) really gambling on tomorrow\u2019s vote and has not priced in fully all scenarios \u2014 so expect big moves,\u201d warned ETX Capital analyst Michael Baker.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday night, the markets will start opening from the Far East \u2026 and it could be a hugely volatile open, regardless of the outcome,\u201d he warned.\n\nDave Ramsden, the Bank of England\u2019s policymaker overseeing markets and banking, told Bloomberg that its foreign exchange desk would be manned overnight Sunday/Monday to ensure smooth trading.\n\n\u2013 Rollercoaster trade \u2013\n\nIn rollercoaster deals, the pound had rallied Thursday to almost $1.30 on news that negotiators had hammered out an agreement that would avoid Britain leaving the EU without a divorce deal \u2014 a move many commentators warn could be economically catastrophic.\n\nHowever, sterling then dipped under $1.29 as it became evident that Johnson faced an uphill task in getting the deal past lawmakers, with opposition MPs and some in his own Conservative party saying they were against it.\n\nMost importantly, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up Johnson\u2019s government, said it was \u201cunable\u201d to back him.\n\nBritain voted in June 2016 to leave the European Union but it has delayed its departure date twice so far this year after lawmakers rejected previous Brexit deals.\n\n\u201cBased on everything that has happened over the last three years, it is hard to think that it will pass and then Brexit is on the road to completion,\u201d Baker remarked.\n\n\u2013 Renault sounds alarm \u2013\n\nIn non-Brexit news, Europe\u2019s car sector hit the skids after French auto giant Renault released a gloomy sales outlook.\n\nRenault shares crashed 12 percent to 48.38 euros in Paris after warning that 2019 revenues would be three to four percent lower than last year \u2014 and blamed \u201cless favourable than anticipated\u201d conditions.\n\n\u201cRenault shares slumped today after the company lowered its full-year revenue plus profit guidance,\u201d said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.\n\n\u2013 Sharp Chinese slowdown \u2013\n\nWall Street stocks dipped in early trading as solid earnings from Coca-Cola and American Express were offset by a weak Chinese economic report and uncertainty over Brexit.\n\nChina reported growth of just 6.0 percent in the third quarter, its slowest rate in nearly three decades, due in part to a lengthy trade war with the United States.\n\nThe Shanghai market closed off 1.3 percent while Hong Kong dipped 0.5 percent amid concern over the possibility of more violent protests over the weekend.\n\n\u2013 Key figures around 1400 GMT \u2013\n\nPound/dollar:
