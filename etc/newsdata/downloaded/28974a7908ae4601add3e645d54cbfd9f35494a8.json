That means it will likely be able to accept applications for retail marijuana sales by the end of 2019, Heidrich said.\n\nThe state will need time to process the applications, and retailers will also need local approvals, but the state is projecting revenue from marijuana sales by March 15, Heidrich said. How swiftly the applications are approved might depend on how complete they are, he said.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we get applications. It\u2019s possible we get applications from someone who has all their ducks in a row and has a municipality lined up that\u2019s poised to give them local authorization,\u201d Heidrich said.\n\nMaine\u2019s rollout of legal marijuana has been beset with hiccups, such as a squabble over the hiring of a key consultant, and was also slowed by former Gov. Paul LePage\u2019s opposition to legalization.\n\nHowever, the result has been a process that will ultimately protect public health and safety, said Scott Gagnon, who led a drive against legalization and has since played a role on a state marijuana commission.\n\n\u201cFrom a public health perspective it has been a slower pace, a more deliberative pace than has happened in some states,\u201d Gagnon said. \u201cI think that\u2019s been good.\u201d\n\nDavid Boyer, an independent marijuana industry consultant in Maine, said that it\u2019s \u201cdisappointing that adults still don\u2019t have a place to purchase legal cannabis in Maine,\u201d but that the finish line is in sight.", "description": "Maine will need time to process the applications, and retailers will also need local approvals, but the state is expecting revenue from marijuana next March.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GI854_mariju_ZG_20180509122504.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
