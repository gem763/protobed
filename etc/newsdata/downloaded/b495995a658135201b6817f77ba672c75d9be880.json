in the hope of freeing us from the momentous consequences of climate breakdown. History will judge them kindly.\u201c\n\nWhat is the aim, and the means?\n\nThe activists are seeking to halt planned expansion at the airport. They say: \u201cHeathrow emits 18 million tons of CO2 a year. Around the world there are 118 countries whose total emissions are less than Heathrow airport\u2019s.\n\n\u201cA third runway will produce a further 7.3 million tons, harming us and our children, devastating wildlife, shattering communities, damaging the natural environment probably beyond repair \u2013 certainly in our lifetime \u2013 and accelerating the already lethal pace of global heating.\u201d\n\nThey intend to fly drones within the 5km exclusion zone at Heathrow, starting in the early hours of the morning. While the airport is technically open continuously, no flights are scheduled to depart after 11.05pm nor arrive before 4.50am.\n\nThe protestors will notify the airport that \u201cunmanned aerial vehicles\u201d are flying, and expect operations to be stopped \u2013 which would involve dozens of inbound flights being diverted to other airports, and the first wave of departures to be halted.\n\nHow much of a danger do drones pose to aircraft?\n\nNo pilot will operate an aircraft where there is any danger of a collision with a drone of any size. They can be ingested into engines, damage crucial elements of the control surfaces or crack the windscreen.\n\nThat is why Gatwick airport was closed for 33 hours in the week before Christmas 2018, causing 1,000 flights to be cancelled and wrecking the plans of 150,000 travellers, due to an unauthorised drone.\n\nBy increasing the workload of air traffic controllers, and demanding time of police and security staff, the protest will increase broader risks.\n\nChris Woodroofe, Gatwick\u2019s chief operating officer, told The Independent: \u201cOperations will not shut down until a drone is reported. And at that point, it will be an unplanned event. Those drones will generate tens of planes being distributed to other airports around the UK and northern Europe.\n\n\u201cAir-traffic controllers have to land them in an organised and safe way across the south of England and north of Europe.\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone want to start a sequence of events that has that outcome?\u201d\n\nWhat does the law say about flying drones near airports?\n\nUnauthorised drones cannot be flown within the Flight Restriction Zone (FRZ) of each airport. In the case of Heathrow, this is a circle with a radius of 5km (three miles) whose centre point is the middle of the northern runway. In addition, the zone is restricted at the end of each runway.\n\nThe Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that under the Air Navigation Order 2016: \u201cDrone users who flout the new height and airport boundary restrictions could be charged with recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or any person in an aircraft.\n\n\u201cThis could result in an unlimited fine, up to five years in prison, or both.\u201d\n\nThe deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Laurence Taylor, says: \u201cDrone use in restricted airspace has the capability to not only cause a significant safety risk, but also cause great disruption to the public at the airport being targeted and connecting airports internationally.\u201d\n\nWhat is likely to happen?\n\nMr Taylor says: \u201cThe Met has been preparing for this protest for some weeks now, and we have been working closely with partners to ensure that any potential disruption that could be caused by this activity is averted or kept to a minimum.\n\n\u201cThe police\u2019s job is to detect and stop criminal activity in a proportionate way, and there is a robust policing plan in place to ensure that we are in a position to deal with any illegal activity as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\n\u201cWe will be deploying extra officers for this operation, and the plan covers the unique challenges that come with a protest targeting the airport and the surrounding areas.\u201d\n\nThe airport says: \u201cWe are working closely with the authorities to ensure Heathrow airport will remain open on 13 September despite the threat of illegal protest activity involving the use of drones.\n\n\u201cWe have in place dynamic risk-assessment programmes which are carried out by airfield and security experts and at no time will safety be compromised.\n\n\u201cAlongside drone detection capabilities, we will mitigate the impact of this illegal action and operate in a way that is safe at all times.\u201d\n\nThe Independent understands that infringement of the drone exclusion zone will not in itself automatically trigger the closure of Heathrow\u2019s runways. Detection equipment will focus on areas where flights could be endangered.\n\nOne of the participants, Roger Hallam \u2013 a founding member of Extinction Rebellion \u2013 said: \u201cThe Heathrow expansion is the biggest carbon-intensive infrastructure project in Europe. So I\u2019ll be flying a drone at head height, some distance from Heathrow.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be 100 per cent safe and 100 per cent illegal.\u201d\n\nHow likely are flights to be disrupted \u2013 and what happens if they are?\n\nUntil the scale and discipline of the protest becomes apparent, it is impossible to say. One fear of the police is that other individuals, or possibly even terrorists, could use the protest as cover for more sinister and dangerous activities.\n\nHeathrow Pause rejects any responsibility from flights being disrupted: \u201dWe\u2019re not the ones who will be cancelling flights or grounding aircraft. Our action is designed to be completely safe.\n\n\u201cIf any planes are grounded, it will be Heathrow airport\u2019s decision, probably thanks to pressure from their insurers. Money talks.\u201d\n\nThe group also says passengers have been given six weeks\u2019 notice and should have made \u201calternative travel arrangements\u201d.\n\nIf flights are disrupted, the airline must provide alternative transport as soon as possible, and provide meals and, if necessary, accommodation until you can get where you planned to be.\n\nWhatever the eventual outcome, many aircraft that are intended to land at Heathrow on Friday 13 September will carry tons of additional fuel in case they need to hold for long spells and/or divert. Even if everything ends up going smoothly, the extra weight will directly increase the amount of CO2 produced by aviation on the day.\n\nI am booked to fly to/from Heathrow on Friday. Can I change my flights without penalty?\n\nNo airline, to the best of my knowledge, is permitting changes to restricted tickets (which almost all cheaper fares are) to avoid possible disruption.", "description": "On Friday 13 September, the Heathrow Pause group of climate change activists plans to halt all flying at Europe\u2019s busiest airport by flying drones within the Heathrow exclusion zone.
