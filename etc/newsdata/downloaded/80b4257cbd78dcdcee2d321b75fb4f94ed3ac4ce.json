It was fun going out there and hearing the fans,\u201d Severino said.\n\nBut another bizarre injury struck the Yankees. After the game New York announced reliever Dellin Betances partially tore the Achilles tendon in his left foot when he hopped on the mound after striking out Brandon Drury, the second and final batter he faced in his season debut Sunday at Toronto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about as freak as it can be,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said.\n\nBetances\u2019 season appears over after eight pitches. He and Severino spent much of the summer rehabbing together. A two-time All-Star, Severino got hurt while warming up before his first scheduled spring training appearance on March 5.\n\nHe began tentatively in game 152, opening with a 12-pitch walk to Brian Goodwin, but got sharper and allowed just a pair of singles.\n\n\u201cAll his pitches were nice and crisp,\u201d the Angels\u2019 Luis Rengifo said.\n\nSeverino walked two and struck out four, throwing 47 of 67 pitches for strikes and leaving to an ovation from fans tracking his pitch count.\n\n\u201cLooked pretty good out there, pretty sharp,\u201d catcher Austin Romine said. \u201cWe need Sevy where we\u2019re going. He\u2019s pitched some big games for us, and we look forward to him pitching some more big games for us.\u201d\n\nSeverino had seven swings and misses on fastballs and two on sliders.\n\n\u201cMy fastball command I think was great. I still need to work a little bit more in sliders to left-handers,\u201d he said.\n\nSeverino\u2019s return gives the Yankees a plethora of postseason rotation choices from a group that includes James Paxton (14-6), Masahiro Tanaka (10-8), Domingo Germ\u00e1n (18-4), CC Sabathia (5-8) and J.A. Happ (12-8).\n\nSeverino was 19-8 with a 3.39 ERA in 32 starts last year but struggled late in the season. The Yankees at first diagnosed Severino with shoulder inflammation, but when the 25-year-old right-hander failed to improve he was sent for an MRI on April 9 that revealed a strained latissimus dorsi muscle. He didn\u2019t throw off a mound again until a bullpen session on Aug. 9 and made three minor league injury rehabilitation appearances from Sept. 1-11.\n\nHe started in a groove.\n\n\u201cAnother huge step back for him,\u201d Boone said.\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nNew York lowered its magic number to one over Cleveland to clinch the Yankees\u2019 55th postseason appearance - 22 more than any other team. New York\u2019s magic number dropped to two over Tampa Bay to wrap up the Yankees\u2019 19th AL East title, their first since 2012. And at 99-53, the Yankees are on the verge of their 21st 100-win season, their first in back-to-back years since 2002-04.\n\nSCORING\n\nGleyber Torres hit his 38th homer , a three-run drive that capped a six-run fourth inning against Jos\u00e9 Suarez. One pitch earlier, Didi Gregorius doubled in two runs.\n\nNew York took a 2-0 lead in the second off No\u00e9 Ramirez (5-4) on Gio Urshela\u2019s RBI single and Cameron Maybin\u2019s run-scoring double .\n\nJonathan Loiasiga (2-1) followed Severino with two hitless innings as part of a six-hitter against the Angels, already assured of a losing record at 68-83.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nAngels: Rengifo left in the seventh after hurting his left hand on a swing and miss against Stephen Tarpley. X-rays were negative and he will have more tests Wednesday. \u201cAs soon as I started to swing, kind of felt like a pop,\u201d Rengifo said. \u2026 INF Tommy La Stella, who hasn\u2019t played since fracturing his right tibia with a foul ball on July 2, made the trip. La Stella, who is from Westwood, New Jersey, still is feeling discomfort.\n\nYankees: OF Giancarlo Stanton, limited to nine games this season, is due back Wednesday or Thursday after recovering from a knee injury. Stanton has been sidelined since straining the posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee on June 25. \u2026 Maybin was shaking his left wrist in the late innings; the wrist has bothered him since August. \u201cIt crops up on him in certain games,\u201d Boone said. \u201cProbably won\u2019t start him tomorrow.\u201d \u2026 DH-1B Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n (strained left oblique) will not swing a bat this week. \u2026 C Gary S\u00e1nchez (strained left groin) remains in the treatment phase of his recovery. \u2026 Happ had a cortisone shot Friday to treat biceps tendinitis in his pitching arm and anticipates making his scheduled start Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSabathia makes his final regular-season start at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday, and Germ\u00e1n could follow in his second straight relief appearance as New York limits his innings. Left-hander Dillon Peters (3-3) starts for the Angels.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Luis Severino got Albert Pujols to reach for a slider with runners at the corners and ground into a double play that ended the first inning of his season debut, then punched the pocket of his glove to celebrate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ronald Blum"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/17/angels_yankees_baseball_46487_c0-136-3251-2031_s1770x1032.jpg?34fb428505875cc5009327f63ac7fad0fbcdd59f", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
