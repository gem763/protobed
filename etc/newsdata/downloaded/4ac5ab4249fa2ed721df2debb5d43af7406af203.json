The first set up Lazard's touchdown, and the second allowed Green Bay to run the clock down to two seconds before Crosby's game-winner. In both cases, replays showed Flowers' hands on the neck or shoulder \u2014 not the face \u2014 of a Packers lineman.\n\nMatt Prater was good from 26, 22, 41, 51 and 54 yards for the Lions (2-2-1).\n\nMatthew Stafford finished 18 of 32 for 265 yards and was sacked three times.\n\nGreen Bay outside linebacker Preston Smith, centre, celebrates after sacking Lions QB Matthew Stafford during the second half.
