To the officers who protect all of us \u2013 thank you.\u201d\n\nMr Trudeau will go ahead with plans to campaign in Ontario on Sunday, a Liberal official said.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nRead more\n\nTrudeau changes profile image to photo of him with black person\n\nI\u2019m less offended by Trudeau\u2019s blackface than I am by his policies\n\nJustin Trudeau calls election and dissolves Canada\u2019s parliament", "description": "Justin Trudeau donned a bulletproof vest to speak at an election rally on Saturday night after an unspecified security threat.Accompanied by a heavy security detail, the Canadian prime minister took to the stage 90 minutes late to deliver his speech to about 2,000 supporters ahead of the 21 October vote", "authors": ["Andy Gregory"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DHXpNcNugWFDCZOlLT4XbA--~B/aD0zNTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/c6bc8d913d722d1ff035db41804a58a6", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
