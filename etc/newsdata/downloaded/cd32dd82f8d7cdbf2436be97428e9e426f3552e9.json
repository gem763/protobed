(Maxim Shipenkov/Pool via Reuters)\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian president Vladimir Putin agreed to a deal Tuesday to oversee the removal of Syrian Kurdish YPG forces from a safe zone more than three times the size of the zone agreed on between the United States and Turkey last week.\n\nUnder the agreement, Turkish and Russian forces will remove Kurdish forces and weapons up to 30 kilometers from the Turkish border starting Wednesday, before patrolling a narrower ten kilometer strip of \u201csafe zone\u201d along the border in six days.\n\nThe territory allotted to the Turks under the deal extends past the prior U.S.-Turkey agreement, which only included the central part of the border between the Syrian towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al Ain, where Turkish forces had focused their military offensive. Under the deal struck between Erdogan and Putin, Turkey will retain most of the area it initially said it would capture as part of \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d\n\nHours after the announcement, the Turkish defense ministry reported that the United States had told Turkey that the withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the \u201csafe zone\u201d was complete. Vice President Mike Pence received a letter on Tuesday from Syrian Democratic Forces commander Mazloum Kobani, who stated the Kurds had withdrawn \u201cfrom the relevant area of operations.\u201d\n\nAfter six hours of talks with Erdogan in Sochi, Russia, Putin described the deal as \u201cvery important, if not momentous, to resolve what is a pretty tense situation which has developed on the Syrian-Turkish border.\u201d The deal mirrors a 1998 agreement between Turkey and the Syrian government.\n\nThe move evidences Russia\u2019s influence in the region following the U.S. withdrawal. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper arrived in Baghdad Wednesday for talks with the Iraqi government over the retreat of U.S. forces into western Iraq. On Sunday, Esper stated the move was \u201cto help defend Iraq\u201d and \u201cto perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\u201d although Iraq said Tuesday that \u201cThere is no agreement for these forces to stay in Iraq.\u201d", "description": "Turkish and Russian forces will remove Kurdish forces up to 30 kilometers from the Turkish border before patrolling a narrower ten kilometer strip of \u201csafe zone.\u201d", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
