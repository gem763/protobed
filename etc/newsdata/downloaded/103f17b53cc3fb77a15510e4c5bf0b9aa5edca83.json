So much so, that he\u2019s called his onscreen career a \u2018lifeline\u2019.\n\nAppearing on the Blank Podcast, David suggested that the creative nature of being an actor brings him stability and he\u2019s never had an \u2018episode\u2019 while working.\n\n\u2018First of all the interesting thing about my own particular brand of it, is that I never have an episode when I\u2019m working,\u2019 he revealed.\n\nDavid plays Hopper in Netflix series Stranger Things (Picture: Netflix)\n\n\u2018So, in some way I\u2019ve generally been able to see a link between my own creative energies when they\u2019re channelled into some kind of work form and that when they are not channelled \u2013 it goes off into some kind of madness.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid said: \u2018It has made working even more vial to me \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a lifeline\u2026 if I wasn\u2019t an artist I\u2019d be a lot worse off and [it\u2019s] made work more vital.\u2019\n\nDavid has previously said that he was worried his bipolar would cost him his acting career, so he chose not to reveal his diagnosis for several years.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018As an actor, you\u2019re worried about getting hired, but now I\u2019m at a place where I can talk about this [now],\u2019 he told British GQ. \u2018Also, I\u2019m in my forties, I may as well be myself, whether I get work or not.\u2019\n\nDavid has become well known for his role as cop Hopper in Stranger Things, but his character\u2019s fate was up in the air at the end of the third season.\n\nAnd while we\u2019re all eager to know what\u2019s happened to Hopper, it turns out David is too and he\u2019s been demanding answers from show bosses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe joked that a \u2018lack of phone calls\u2019 from producers after season three has had him questioning whether Hopper really is dead, after getting trapped in the Upside Down at the end of the series.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t gotten many phone calls,\u2019 he said on Late Night with Seth Meyers, before FaceTiming producers to ask if Hopper was dead.\n\nTheir response? They\u2019re still figuring things out\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
