Unfortunately, this is not the first time such an attack has taken place in the West. There is no excuse for terrorism in the name of any cause. We find the murder of innocents in the name of an extremist, racist ideology which dehumanizes Muslims particularly reprehensible.\n\n\"The U.S. has been, and must remain, a firm partner of New Zealand in intelligence-sharing, combatting terrorism, and matters of security and public safety. We are all in this together.\"", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- James Carafano, vice president of The Heritage Foundation's Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy, and Robin Simcox,\u00a0global terrorism expert and Margaret Thatcher Fellow with Heritage's Thatcher Center for Freedom, released the following response Friday after the terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand:", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png"}
