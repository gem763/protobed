Government figures showed that 347 motorcyclists died in crashes in 2017 (stock image)\n\nWHAT IS THE WORKING MEMORY? Working memory is the system that is responsible for the temporary holding and processing of information. While it is sometimes used synonymously with short term memory two concepts are distinct. We can hold far more information in our short-term memory, because it does not entail the manipulation or organisation of material. Working memory is generally considered to have limited capacity, and researchers had previously believe it could only hold seven \u2018chunks\u2019 of information. This could be digits, letters, words, or other units, but anything more, and the memory network struggles. Now that number has been reduced to four.\n\nInstead, their working memory \u2013 which holds temporary information \u2013 had 'overwritten' what they saw during the time between looking to one side and actually pulling out onto the junction.\n\n'These studies demonstrate that even in safety-critical situations it is possible to observe dramatic failures of visual memory,' said Dr Peter Chapman.\n\n'These \"Saw But Forgot\" (SBF) errors were remarkably frequent in the simulator and we have every reason to think that they may be equally prevalent in the real world.\n\n'The surprising lack of memory may be exactly why these crashes appear so mysterious.'\n\nDr Chapman and his colleagues suggested drivers say the word 'bike' when they see a motorcycle approaching, in a bid to strengthen their memory and stop it being overwritten by the brain.\n\nHe added: 'If relevant visual information is encoded phonologically it has been shown that it is no longer subject to visuospatial interference.\n\n'Clearly any research that improves our understanding of these crashes and the kind of countermeasures that can be used to prevent them, has the potential to be a major contribution to world health.'\n\nThe study was published in the journal PLOS One.", "description": "Researchers from Nottingham University found in a study that people were five times more likely to forget seeing a motorbike than a car after looking at it at a road junction.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/23/17/18834124-0-image-a-8_1569255121459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
