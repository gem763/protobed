Kids decked out in their school uniforms joined the crowds marching down Collins Street, honouring the climate strike\u2019s young originator Greta Thunberg. That\u2019s not to say young folks didn\u2019t turn up in casual gear, either.\n\nWhat we\u2019re saying here is the protest lived up to the billing of a \u2018school strike\u2019, even if the majority of attendees were adults. Everywhere you turned, there would be a child urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to institute more ambitious emission reduction targets \u2013 often with signs saying the planet is currently hotter than Shawn Mendes.\n\nOur young guns also funny as fuck, even in the face of crisis.\n\nHike on over here to see what we mean.\n\nThe rest of you folks turned up.\n\nWhile entirely accurate crowd estimates are yet to materialise, aerial footage of the Melbourne strike suggests 100,000 people took to the street. That number would place today\u2019s climate strike as the city\u2019s largest civilian demonstration since 2003, when an estimated 150,000 people took to the street to oppose Australia\u2019s involvement in the Iraq war.\n\nTim Flannery, 2007 Australian of the Year, is absolutely chuffed.\n\nI literally bumped into Professor Tim Flannery, noted conservationist, chief of the Climate Council, and 2007 Australian of the Year, on the steps of the Old Treasury Building. Surrounded by colleagues and their energetic children, Flannery told PEDESTRIAN.TV he\u2019d describe the protests with one word: \u201crelief.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge sense of relief that we\u2019re finally gaining the critical mass where government can\u2019t ignore this message any longer,\u201d Flannery said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many people are here today, but I\u2019d be guessing kind of, 100,000 in Melbourne.\u201d\n\nFlannery, whose criticised complacency on climate change with his 2005 book The Weather Makers, said \u201cIt\u2019s the minute before midnight.\n\n\u201cWe need to make serious decisions about how we reduce emissions, otherwise we will forfeit our future, so this is not a moment too soon.\u201d\n\nThe man given Australia\u2019s highest civilian honour turned his ire towards policymakers and their supporters in the media, saying \u201cThey\u2019re not climate deniers, I call them climate predators, because they are praying on our children\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cNothing will convince them. They\u2019re earning money doing what they do, or else they\u2019re idiots in the Greek sense of the word \u2013 people interested only in their own business, and no interest in the wider society. If we can\u2019t change them, we\u2019ve just got to move on past them.\u201d\n\nYou were well behaved, given the circumstances.\n\nDespite a considerable police presence, a Victoria Police spokesperson told PEDESTRIAN.TV no arrests have been made in relation to the demonstration.\n\nIf this kind of pressure keeps up, it might just convince the powers that be to make meaningful change.", "description": "Well, here's the sixth: it was pretty rad.", "authors": ["David Adams"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/climate-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
