It was originally introduced on July 30 by Supervisor Catherine Stefani, who spoke after the resolution was passed unanimously.\n\n\u201cThe NRA has done more to perpetuate and create the sick gun violence epidemic terrorizing our country,\u201d she said during the supervisor\u2019s meeting to vote on the resolution. \u201cThey buy off politicians, prevent common sense gun violence legislation, prevent gun violence research and tell us and everybody that it\u2019s video games, movies or mental illness. Every country on this earth is exposed to these issues and influences in equal measure, and yet only the United States faces this kind of mass gun violence.\u201d\n\nThe NRA responded with a video released on Sept. 4 featuring a speech by NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre, and on Monday released a statement on Twitter saying \u201cThis lawsuit comes with a message to those who attack the NRA: We will never stop fighting for our law-abiding members and their constitutional freedoms\u2026 We will always confront illegal and discriminatory practices against our organization and the millions of members we serve.\u201d\n\nRead @NRA CEO and EVP Wayne LaPierre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement on NRA lawsuit against San Francisco: (1/2) pic.twitter.com/Y3t1fAx1LE \u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 10, 2019\n\nThe resolution was passed the same day as Walmart announced it would reduce gun and ammunition sales at its stores nation-wide and requested that people refrain from open carrying inside the stores.", "description": "The NRA filed a lawsuit against San Francisco after lawmakers passed a resolution declaring it a domestic terrorist organization.", "authors": ["Jasmine Aguilera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J9FN6pnqIwmH.Ww.COI9VA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://slick-prod.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slick_thumb/yahooNews-305808-1568139434481.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
