A family had brought their 4-year-old son, a boy with Down syndrome who was uncommunicative. Something about the horse captivated him. Sitting in the saddle, he signed \u201chorse\u201d\u2014the first word he had ever communicated. His mother started crying, which prompted his first spoken word too: \u201cMama.\u201d\n\nMoved by the encounter, Ms. Hill-McQueeney began to learn about the then little-known concept of therapeutic riding or equine therapy. She realized that she had been involved in equine therapy for much of her life, though she had never seen it in those terms. Now 47 years old and the president and CEO of BraveHearts, a therapeutic-riding center outside of Chicago, Ms. Hill-McQueeney was born a congenital amputee, missing her right arm. When she was 4, growing up in Florida, her parents bought her a couple of Shetland ponies and built a corral. \u201cMy dad was very adamant that it was a two-handed world,\u201d she recalls. Riding and caring for the horses forced her to learn to use her prosthetic arm\u2014brushing the horses, saddling them, holding the reins. \u201cI just fell in love with them,\u201d she says. But it also taught her grit and perseverance: \u201cI broke a lot of bones.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018I haven\u2019t seen a situation that a horse hasn\u2019t been an answer to.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, she created her own therapeutic-riding programs, serving children with a range of physical and cognitive disabilities. She saw children with autism and children who had suffered traumatic accidents. Their parents often brought them because nothing else had worked. No matter the disability or the diagnosis, therapeutic riding helped. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a situation that a horse hasn\u2019t been an answer to,\u201d Ms. Hill-McQueeney says.\n\nAt BraveHearts, which began in 2002, Ms. Hill-McQueeney now focuses on military veterans. Many are referred by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs or come from VA hospitals\u2014men and women dealing with blindness, spinal-cord injuries, PTSD and other issues. They step off the bus skeptical, she says, doubting that a horse could help solve their problems\u2014but when they leave, they\u2019re different: \u201cI can\u2019t get them back on the bus.\u201d The veterans don\u2019t just say that the horse improved their quality of life; they often tell her that the horse saved their life.\n\nKyle Farbman, a veteran who suffers from PTSD and a survivor of military sexual trauma, says that he was ready to end his life when he got a call from BraveHearts. \u201cHow are you? Come ride,\u201d he recalls the group saying. The horses give him a reason to wake up, to get out of the house and into the world, to see another day. His service dog, Ricky, acts as a buffer against the world, he says, but the horses \u201chelp me with my mind.\u201d\n\nMs. Hill-McQueeney suspects that research has barely scratched the surface of the therapeutic benefits that horses can offer humans.

Ms. Hill-McQueeney is fiercely committed to stemming the tide of veteran suicide.\n\nExperience has taught her that the key to the therapeutic process is keeping the focus on the horses\u2014having the veterans direct their attention to making sure the horse is comfortable. \u201cIf someone comes to the farm and is apprehensive or fearful, the horse is covered in fear,\u201d Ms. Hill-McQueeney says. \u201cHorses are brilliant at reading intention. They are lie detectors, instantly.\u201d\n\nStudies have found that horses can smell adrenaline and sync their heart rates with those of humans. \u201cWhen you\u2019re near a horse, you have to practice the art of keeping your energy in a good spot,\u201d she says. \u201cTo trust them, they have to trust you. Helping the horse reciprocates to helping the person. It\u2019s just so natural, but it ends up changing you.\u201d\n\nResearch on equine therapy has shown that it improves quality of life and reduces depression and suicidal tendencies. A study of 23 subjects published earlier this year in the Journal of Military Medicine found that the treatment improved self-esteem, eased PTSD symptoms, and increased veterans\u2019 ability to work and perform daily tasks. Ms. Hill-McQueeney suspects that the research has barely scratched the surface of the benefits that horses can offer humans. Part of the problem is funding: \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a pharmaceutical company that\u2019s behind equine therapy,\u201d she notes.\n\n\u201c \u2018All a horse really wants is peace.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHer theory is that horses have a calming influence because they are prey animals, not predators like dogs (or humans). Even on the racetrack, horses run out of the gates because their instincts tell them not to be last, whereas dogs run because they are hoping to catch and eat a mechanical hare. \u201cAs humans, we\u2019re chasing the paycheck, chasing the title. Horses aren\u2019t like that,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been able to survive by reading intention. All a horse really wants is peace.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, she launched Operation Mustang, which pairs veterans with mustangs\u2014a wild, undomesticated breed of horse. In the U.S., tens of thousands of mustangs have been rounded up into holding pens to keep them from encroaching on private grazing land. In the process, they are removed from the lands they have known and the herds they have grown up with; they are castrated, inoculated and freeze-branded. In short, they are deeply traumatized.\n\nMs. Hill-McQueeney sees a parallel with many suffering veterans. \u201cVets respond to that wild piece,\u201d she says. \u201cThe mustangs instantly require their attention, and these guys are used to chaos.\u201d\n\nThrough the work of taming the mustangs, veterans rediscover trust, partnership and purpose, she says. They form a deep bond with the horses, and many go on to become instructors at the facility, helping other veterans past their darkest moments.\n\nThis year, BraveHearts will see more than 1,000 veterans, and Ms. Hill-McQueeney longs to reach even more. \u201cIs it unconventional? Innovative? Does it help?\u201d she asks. Her answer to all those questions is \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got an epidemic of veteran suicide in this country,\u201d she says. \u201cIf nothing else works, try a horse.\u201d\n\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at elizabeth.winkler@wsj.com", "description": "Meggan Hill-McQueeney, the president of BraveHearts, is an ardent advocate for the benefits of therapeutic riding, also known as equine therapy", "authors": ["Elizabeth Winkler", "Elizabeth.Winkler Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/B3-FH267_HILL_SOC_20191023132141.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
