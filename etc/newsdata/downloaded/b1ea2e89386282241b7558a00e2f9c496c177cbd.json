Her husband wrote a book of their love story to help her remember. originally appeared on goodmorningamerica.com\n\nSteve Curto wanted a way for his wife, Camre, to remember their 10-year relationship, everything from their first date to their wedding and the birth of their son.\n\nSo Curto, 38, of Michigan, wrote a book, \"But I Know I Love You,\" that he self-published and released on their fourth wedding anniversary last month.\n\nCamre Curto, 31, has no memory of anything her husband documented in the book.\n\nShe lost both her long-term and short-term memories when she suffered a stroke and a seizure on the day she gave birth to the couple's 7-year-old son Gavin.\n\nPHOTO: Steve and Camre Curto pose with their son Gavin in this family photo. (Courtesy Steve Curto) More\n\n\"Everything in the book is a memory of what we've gone through and what I've missed,\" Camre Curto told \"Good Morning America.\" \"I enjoy [reading] it very much, but right now with everything it\u2019s kind of mixed feelings.\"\n\n(MORE: Mom who nearly died after childbirth has a message for moms)\n\n\"Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me because it shows me everything that we have been through and that I don\u2019t have inside of me,\" she said.\n\nCamre had a normal, healthy pregnancy up until her third trimester, when she started to experience frequent vomiting, according to Steve.\n\nOne day 33 weeks into her pregnancy, Camre's throat began to swell and she had trouble breathing. Steve rushed her to the emergency room, where she went into a grand mal seizure.\n\nDoctors quickly performed an emergency c-section on Camre and delivered Gavin, who weighed just over four pounds, according to Steve.\n\nThe seizure led Camre to lose oxygen to her brain, which caused the stroke.\n\nThe stroke affected both sides of Camre's brain and wiped out her long and short-term memory, according to Camre's occupational therapist, Jessica Smith.\n\nPHOTO: Camre Curto looks at a picture of her son, Gavin, during her recovery. (Courtesy Steve Curto) More\n\n\"She couldn\u2019t recall memories prior to her brain injury and she can\u2019t remember short-term memories now,\" said Smith, a therapist at Galaxy Brain and Therapy Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \"What happened to her is extremely rare.\"\n\nDoctors later determined that Camre had undiagnosed preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorder which reduces blood supply to the fetus, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nShe then went into eclampsia, which is when pregnant women with preeclampsia develop seizures or coma. Camre was intubated and put into a medically-induced coma, so doctors and her family did not immediately know the extent of her memory loss, according to Steve.\n\n(MORE: Viral post shows everyone can use #onthewayfriends now and then)\n\n\"When they brought her out of the coma, and she started to wake up, something wasn\u2019t right,\" he said. \"She had no idea who she was or that she had just given birth. She didn\u2019t know who I was or who her parents were.\"\n\nCamre spent 30 days in the hospital after giving birth, while her son Gavin spent 36 days in the NICU after his premature birth.\n\n\"I basically lived at the hospital,\" said Steve. \"They want the child to bond with the mom after birth but Camre wasn\u2019t able to bet there, so I did skin-to-skin with him and did all the feedings.\"\n\nPHOTO: Steve Curto holds his son, Gavin, shortly after his birth.
