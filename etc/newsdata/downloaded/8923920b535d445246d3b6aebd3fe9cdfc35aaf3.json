Cortes insisted that Hispanic Americans want \"results\" and pointing to rising incomes and small businesses within the community.\n\n\"This president has simply been an amazing leader for Hispanics,\" Cortes said. \"I think a lot of Hispanics look at Donald Trump and they may say, 'Look, I would like him if he phrased things differently.'\"\n\nCuomo dismissed the argument and said Trump has consistently \"denigrated\" the Latino community. The CNN anchor also knocked Trump's support among Hispanic voters, which he said Trump has \"a third of them at best.\"\n\nCNN ANCHOR CHRIS CUOMO'S VIRAL 'FREDO' RANT DRAWS MIXED REACTIONS FROM CELEBRITIES\n\n\"Put that in context,\" Cortes responded. \"A third of them, Chris, is incredibly compared to expectations.\"\n\n\"For someone who says bigoted things about them, maybe,\" Cuomo shot back.\n\n\"No, he does not say bigoted- that is not true,\" Cortes reacted. \"Now that is fake news for you to say that.\"\n\nThe conservative pundit went on to argue that \"what's bigoted\" is making the southern border a \"racial issue when it's not.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"America is not a race, so by protecting America, you are protecting Americans of every color whether they are brown or black or purple,\" Cortes continued. \"But what has the media done on a consistent basis? It's trying to make his tough border policies inherently or systemically racist-\"\n\n\"Because he has depicted the people who are coming to the border as savages who are bombarding the gate,\" Cuomo interrupted.\n\n\"Some of them are,\" Cortes told the anchor. \"Some of them are, Chris, and we know that.\"\n\nCuomo later slammed Cortes for being Trump's \"echo,\" something Cortes took offense and prompted the host to apologize.", "description": "A pro-Trump CNN commentator blasted his colleague, primetime anchor Chris Cuomo, for spreading \"fake news\" about President Trump during a heated debate about his recent outreach to Hispanic\u00a0voters.", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn", "Joseph A.
