They have had enough tolerance,\u201d another added.\n\nSome comments hit out at a photographer who appeared to block the door to the office to take pictures.\n\nChinese state media focuses on the worst excesses of the violence while downplaying, or blocking, the popular public anger in Hong Kong towards Beijing.\n\nAuthorities also remove viral videos on social media that are sympathetic to the protests, but tend to allow footage that reflects poorly on the pro-democracy movement.\n\nHong Kong has been battered by four months of huge, increasingly violent pro-democracy protests fuelled by sliding freedoms under Beijing\u2019s rule.\n\nIn the early days, fights were rare.\n\nBut on 21 June a mob of Beijing supporters wielding sticks attacked protesters in the town of Yuen Long, hospitalising more than 40 people.\n\nOther attacks by Beijing supporters occurred in the district of North Point, while democracy supporters assaulted two men accused of being Chinese spies during an airport sit-in in August.\n\nIn recent weeks, fights across the ideological divide have intensified and pro-democracy protesters have repeatedly surrounded and attacked people.", "description": "Hong Kong (AFP) \u2013 Video of a Chinese office worker being punched by a Hong Kong democracy supporter as a crowd chanted \u201cgo home\u201d has", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/1f6e10_beijing-supporter-fights-an-anti-government-protester-shopping-mall-in-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
