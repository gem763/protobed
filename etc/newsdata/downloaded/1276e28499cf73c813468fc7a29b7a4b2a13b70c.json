That record, achieved in November 2014 at Christie\u2019s in New York, doubled a low estimate of $15 million, which in itself was considered high for a Ruscha work.\n\nAt the time, his auction record was shy of $7 million for Burning Gas Station, 1965-66, achieved at a Christie\u2019s auction in New York in 2007.\n\n\u201cEverybody loved Smash,\u201d says Ana Maria Celis, Christie\u2019s head of evening sale, post-war and contemporary art. \u201cIt\u2019s an iconic word, it had great scale, and it was from the \u201960s, which made it really special.\u201d\n\nThe exciting aspect of Radio, Celis says, is \u201cwe get to tell the story again, when we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to tell the story again.\u201d\n\nHurting the Word Radio #2 is being sold from the collection of Los Angeles journalist, artistic muse, and collector Joan Quinn and her late husband, Jack, an attorney who died at age 84 in 2017. The couple, who were friends and collectors of many Southern California artists beginning in the 1960s, were married for 55 years.\n\nRuscha, 81, is an American pop artist known for his playful typography, sharp use of color, and California landscapes. Both Radio and Smash were painted not long after Andy Warhol exhibited his Campbell Soup Cans at Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962, putting them in the center of contemporary pop art movement.\n\nThey are considered special, too, Celis says, because many of Ruscha\u2019s text paintings are largely in museum collections.\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence the market is primed for works by Ruscha. On Friday, Christie\u2019s sold 35 works by the artist in the collection of architect Fred Clarke and his wife, Laura, for a total $7.5 million. A gunpowder on paper work, Wavy Robot, sold for $1.2 million, double its high estimate.\n\nThe provenance of Hurting the Word Radio #2 is top-notch, as the Quinns bought the painting directly from the artist in the early 1970s. According to Christie\u2019s, Joan Quinn was a muse for Ruscha, as well as a string of other artists, including Robert Mapplethorpe, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Hockney, and Andy Warhol.\n\nAmong several journalistic endeavors in the arts, Quinn was the West Coast editor for Warhol\u2019s Interview magazine from 1978 to 1989.\n\nChristie\u2019s describes Hurting the Word Radio #2 as an \u201ciconic example of Ed Ruscha\u2019s c-clamp paintings,\u201d in which the artist uses realistic images of c-clamps to distort the \u201cR\u201d and \u201cO\u201d in the word RADIO, laid out in large, sunny yellow capital letters on an azure blue background. Ruscha created only seven \u201cc-clamp\u201d works, all in 1964, and only four are of the same scale. Radio is smaller than Smash (71.7 inches by 67 inches) at 59 inches by 55 inches.\n\n\u201cThe word in a way has this nostalgia attached to it\u2014America and the \u201960s,\u201d Celis says. \u201cThe words he uses are modern and electric and car driven, and the word Radio has a wider connotation for so many more people.\u201d", "description": "Christie\u2019s to sell the pop artist\u2019s 1960s text painting from the collection of Joan and Jack Quinn", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113106/social"}
