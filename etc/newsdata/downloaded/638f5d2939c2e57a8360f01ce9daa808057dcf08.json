Anything can happen if you give people a place to be.\"\n\nMinutes later, the music group Wily Savage started, and campers began migrating toward main stage light near the Little A'Le'Inn.\n\nThe music kicked off weekend events \u2014 inspired by an internet hoax to \"see them aliens\" \u2014 that Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said had drawn perhaps 1,500 people to two tiny desert towns.\n\nLee said late Thursday that more than 150 people also made the rugged trip on washboard dirt roads to get within selfie distance of two gates to the Area 51 U.S. Air Force installation that has long fueled speculation about government studies of space aliens and UFOs.\n\nThe Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to try to enter the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.\n\nLee said no arrests were made.\n\n\"It's public land,\" the sheriff said. \"They're allowed to go to the gate, as long as they don't cross the boundary.\"\n\nAuthorities reported no serious incidents related to festivals scheduled until Sunday in Rachel and Hiko, the two towns closest to Area 51. They're about a 45-minute drive apart on a state road dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, and a two-hour drive from Las Vegas.\n\nEarlier, as Wily Savage band members helped erect the wooden frame for a stage shade in Rachel, guitarist Alon Burton said he saw a chance to perform for people who, like Martinez, were looking for a scene in which to be seen.\n\n\"It started as a joke, but it's not a joke for us,\" he said. \"We know people will come out. We just don't know how many.\"\n\nMichael Ian Borer, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas, sociologist who researches pop culture and paranormal activity, called the festivities sparked by the internet joke \"a perfect blend of interest in aliens and the supernatural, government conspiracies, and the desire to know what we don't know.\"\n\nThe result, Borer said, was \"hope and fear\" for events that include the \"Area 51 Basecamp\" featuring music, speakers and movies in Hiko, and festivals in Rachel and Las Vegas competing for the name \"Alienstock.\"\n\n\"People desire to be part of something, to be ahead of the curve,\" Borer said. \"Area 51 is a place where normal, ordinary citizens can't go. When you tell people they can't do something, they just want to do it more.\"\n\nEric Holt, the Lincoln County emergency manager overseeing preparations, said he believed authorities could handle 30,000 visitors at the two events in Rachel and Hiko.\n\nStill, neighbors braced for trouble after millions of people responded to the \"Storm Area 51\" Facebook post weeks ago.\n\n\"Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,\" said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who can see the festival grounds from his home.\n\nThose who show up in shorts and flip-flops will find no protection against \"critters, snakes and scorpions.\"\n\n\"It will get cold at night. They're not going to find what they're looking for, and they are going to get angry,\" Arnu said.\n\nSome cellphones didn't work Thursday in Rachel, and officials expect what service there was to eventually be overwhelmed.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby airspace, although Air Force jets could be heard in the sun-drenched skies, along with an occasional sonic boom.\n\nGeorge Harris, owner of the Alien Research Center souvenir store in Hiko, said Friday and Saturday's \"Area 51 Basecamp\" will focus on music, movies and talks about extraterrestrial lore.\n\nElectronic dance music DJ and recording artist Paul Oakenfold is Friday's headliner in Hiko.\n\nThe event also promises food trucks and vendors, trash and electric service, and a robust security and medical staff.\n\nHarris said he was prepared for as many as 15,000 people and expected they would appreciate taking selfies with a replica of the Area 51 back gate without having to travel several miles to the real thing.\n\nSharon Wehrly, sheriff in adjacent Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, said messages discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials in Amargosa Valley appeared to work.\n\nShe reported no arrests or incidents Thursday.\n\nHer deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by \"Storm Area 51.\" The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and were sentenced to three days in jail after promising to pay nearly $2,300 each in fines.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
