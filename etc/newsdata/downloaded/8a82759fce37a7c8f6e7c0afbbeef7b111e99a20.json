The bond-market phenomenon raised fears that the U.S.\u2019s record expansion would finally come to an end.\n\nBut its Harvey\u2019s more recent research in behavioral finance that he feels is also worthy of attention. He found that when the sudden economic slowdown came as a shock to investors and companies, the ensuing damage was heightened as businesses slashed investment and jobs.\n\nYet with investors and analysts, scarred by the financial crisis, looking for a sign of recession in every nook and cranny, companies were less likely to take drastic measures when growth took a turn for the worse, if only because they were more prepared.\n\nIt helps, he said, that there has been a multitude of surveys and market-based indicators pointing to the increased alertness of corporate executives to the prospect of a recession.\n\nThe Duke CFO survey conducted in September said 53% of chief financial officers for U.S companies expect a recession by the end of 2020.\n\nSee: Overleveraged companies at the edge of a drop to \u2018junk\u2019 will sharply cut debt\n\nIn addition, the inversion of the yield curve has put investors on guard. The spread between the 3-month bill TMUBMUSD03M, -0.16% and the 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.33% turned negative for the first time since 2007 in May. An inversion by that measure has preceded all nine recessions since World War II.\n\nMore forward-looking survey data this week also pointed to growing trade-related uncertainty from businesses. The ISM manufacturing indicator stayed below 50% in September, indicating a contraction in factory activity, and its services counterpart fell sharply to 52.6%, well below the 55.3% estimate from MarketWatch-polled economists.\n\nGiven the gloom, \u201cit\u2019s naive to think you won\u2019t have a drawdown\u201d in stocks, said Harvey.\n\nThe growth worries hasn\u2019t seem to have dented the resilience of equity markets, however .The S&P 500 SPX, +1.42% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.42% are still both on course for double-digit percentage gains this year.\n\nBut when they do fall, investors should stay prepared by holding a slug of value stocks in their portfolios, he said. Equities that fall in the value column are those that are considered underpriced relative to a fundamental analysis of the companies worth based on measures like price-to-book ratio. Such stocks tend to thrive when the economy turns for the worse or risk assets struggle.\n\nAfter the financial crisis, value has underperformed other factors like growth and momentum, raising questions among stock pickers if value will ever make a comeback.\n\nRead: Value stocks are trading at the steepest discount in history\n\nStill, Harvey says investors should remain hopeful. Value doesn\u2019t have to revert to the mean, or the 50th percentile of historical returns, to see significant gains, and only has to follow the historical return profile of the value factor by a \u201ctrivial\u201d amount to make a big difference for investors.\n\n\u201cValue only has to go from 96th percentile for returns to the 94th percentile of historical returns to make a difference,\u201d he said.", "description": "Campbell Harvey of Research Affiliates says the next recession will be much more shallow than the last downturn if only because investors expect it this time...", "authors": ["Sunny Oh"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS696_camhar_ZG_20191004130541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
