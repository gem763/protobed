Happy is man \u2014 every man \u2014 that he was created in the Divine Image. Life is a gift from the Creator of the world which we cannot take \u2013 Heaven forfend! \u2013 from others.\n\n\u201cHowever, every effort must be made to ease the suffering and the pain of patients approaching death, medically, spiritually and materially, without hastening their death,\u201d Yosef wrote.\n\nAshkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau wrote: \u201cThere is a severe prohibition on causing the death of any person even if he is in a difficult and terminal situation. In certain cases, it is possible to discuss refraining from prolonging life but no action may be carried out to shorten life. Whoever kills the dying, kills.\u201d\n\nMarsudi Syuhud, secretary general of the influential Islamic association Nahdlatul Ulama, said: \u201cProtecting life is one of the purposes of Islamic law, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t stop protecting life until the end of our life.\u201d\n\nThe text itself, while denouncing euthanasia and assisted suicide, declares the moral duty to provide palliative care for terminally ill patients and to surround them with care and assistance.\n\n\u201cWe encourage and support validated and professional palliative care everywhere and for everyone,\u201d it reads. \u201cEven when efforts to continue staving off death seems unreasonably burdensome, we are morally and religiously duty-bound to provide comfort, effective pain and symptoms relief, companionship, care and spiritual assistance to the dying patient and to her/his family.\u201d\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Leaders of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim faiths signed a joint declaration condemning euthanasia and assisted suicide.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
