Martin Scorsese would like a word.\n\nThough the superhero film franchise has throngs of devoted fans, as it turns out, the 76-year-old director \u2015 whose iconic flicks include \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cGoodfellas\u201d and \u201cRaging Bull\u201d \u2015 isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nIn fact, he won\u2019t even deign to watch a Marvel movie in its entirety.\n\n\u201cI tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema,\u201d he said in a recent interview with Empire magazine.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\nThe remarks drew the ire of James Gunn, writer and director of Marvel\u2019s \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d films, who tweeted that he was \u201csaddened\u201d by Scorsese\u2019s take on his work.\n\nFilmmaker Joss Whedon, who directed \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron,\u201d also spoke out in support of Gunn, stating that \u201chis heart & guts are packed into GOTG.\u201d\n\nMartin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way. https://t.co/hzHp8x4Aj8 \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u201d\n\n\n\nI first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG. I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but...\n\n\n\nWell there\u2019s a reason why \u201cI\u2019m always angry\u201d. https://t.co/Wh3ptU2KBp \u2014 Joss Whedon (@joss) October 4, 2019\n\nScorsese\u2019s latest film, \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d is set to hit Netflix in late November, and tells the story of the 1982 killing of Teamster Jimmy Hoffa through the perspective of alleged Bufalino crime family hitman Frank Sheeran.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Gunn said Friday that he \u201cwill always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can\u2019t wait to see\u201d his new film.", "description": "The Oscar-winning director won't even deign to watch one in its entirety.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d98fc6620000046024d41ed.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
