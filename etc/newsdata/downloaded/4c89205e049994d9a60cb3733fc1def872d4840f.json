Here are some that are worth checking out \u2014 and best of all, most of them are completely free to use!\n\n#1: PCalc\n\nFor anyone looking for a calculator that does more than the basic one that ships with iOS (folks such as scientists, engineers, students, programmers, and so on), PCalc is for you. This app is so good that I recommend the paid-for version (especially for iPad users, who still don't get a built-in calculator!).\n\nIt also comes with an Apple Watch app, meaning that you're never without a calculator!\n\nDownload here.\n\n#2: Weather Pro\n\nI've used a lot of weather apps, but I keep coming back to Weather Pro. Not only does it seem to be the most accurate, but it's also well integrated with iOS, and displays weather information is a sensible way.\n\nWhether you just want a basic overview of an in-depth look, Weather Pro has you covered!\n\nHere's some of what you get:\n\n7-day forecast data in periods of 3 hours\n\n\n\nWeather reports for 2 million worldwide locations\n\n\n\nComprehensive details on temperature, wind direction/ speed, air pressure, precipitation amount/ probability, relative humidity, UV index, feels like temperature and more\n\n\n\nWorldwide alerts and warning levels for extreme weather\n\n\n\nUnlimited favourite locations synchronisable via iCloud\n\n\n\nGlobal satellite and animated radar for the USA, Australia and much of Europe\n\n\n\nAdditional features like: widget, webcams, weather photo, weather news etc.\n\n\n\nNo adverts\n\n\n\nDownload here.\n\n#3: F-Secure Freedome\n\nWithout a doubt, Freedome is my favorite VPN service. I've now used it for several years and not only is it simple to set up, it's also highly reliable, and I rarely encounter any issues when using it -- and I've put terabytes of data through this VPN over the years I've been using it!\n\nRunning a quality VPN gives me peace of mind that my data is secured, even when using sketchy Wi-Fi connections (and because all my data is going through it I don't want to be using a sketchy VPN either!).\n\nF-Secure FREEDOME VPN is free to download and use for 5 days. It's quick to install \u2013 no registrations or settings required. After that, prices start at $5.99 a month.\n\nDownload here.\n\n#4: Google Authenticator\n\nA robust and easy-to-use 2-step authenticator that can be used to protect your Google accounts and other online accounts that support an authenticator.\n\nI've used a number of different authenticator apps and this one is the best by far.\n\nFeatures include:\n\nAutomatic setup via QR codes\n\n\n\nSupport for multiple accounts\n\n\n\nSupport for time-based and counter-based code generation\n\n\n\nDownload here.\n\n#5: LastPass Password Manager\n\nThere's are a lot of password managers out there, but based on my testing and real-world usage, LastPass is without a doubt the best of the bunch (and the competition is very stiff).\n\nWith the release of iOS 12, LastPass can now autofill from within apps. Simply launch your apps and LastPass will fill in your username and password.\n\nLastpass securely encrypts your data with AES 256-bit encryption and doesn't have access to any of your data.\n\nDownload here.\n\n#6: 1.1.1.1: Faster Internet\n\nAutomatically encrypt your DNS queries so that you can browser privately using Cloudflare's global network. You also get better performance, thanks to 1.1.1.1 being some 28 percent faster than the next fastest public resolver out there.\n\nNo upsells, no in-app purchases, and free for life.\n\nDownload here.\n\n#7: Just Press Record\n\nJust Press Record is the ultimate mobile audio recorder bringing one tap recording, transcription and iCloud syncing to all your devices. You can operate it hands-free using Siri or from your Apple Watch.\n\nDownload here.\n\n#8: Office Lens\n\nIf you are using your iPhone or iPad's camera to take photos of documents and whiteboards, there's no better app for cleaning up and converting these photos into almost perfect scans than Office Lens. And best of all, it's 100 percent free!\n\nDownload here.\n\n#9: Manual Camera 2\n\nThis app gives you total control over everything the iOS camera offers \u2014 from focus and exposure to shutter speed and the flash level. It also allows you to capture RAW images on later devices, as well as up to 4K video.\n\nDownload here.\n\n#10: IFTTT\n\nThis is one of those services that once you start using it, you mash never be able to put it down again!\n\nAt the core if IFTTT is automation. If you want to automate something, there's a good chance that you can do it with IFTTT. Over 600 apps work with IFTTT including Twitter, Telegram, Google Drive, Twitch, Weather Underground, Instagram, Gmail, and devices like Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Nest, and Philips Hue.\n\nDownload here.", "description": "Let\u2019s take a tour of some of the best iOS apps and services currently available.
