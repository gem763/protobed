The target of this vaccine is not in the epidemic zone, it's aimed at protecting people outside the epidemic zone, places like Goma, and will provide sort of a firewall potentially,\" Ryan said, referring to a city of 2 million on the Rwandan border.\n\n(Additional reporting by Edward McAllister in Dakar; editing by David Clarke)", "description": "GENEVA (Reuters) - The Ebola epidemic in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been confined to a rural area rife with militias and people on the move, making it harder to stamp out altogether, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
