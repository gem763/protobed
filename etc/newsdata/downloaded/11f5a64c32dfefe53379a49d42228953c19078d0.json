After all, it wasn\u2019t all incredible whistle tones and sunshine.\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote Rainbow, I was in a very different headspace. I had to address some very serious things,\u201d the singer says in the trailer, released Monday. \u201cBut now, on my new record, I revisit my roots of pure and utter debaucherous joy. Kesha got her balls back and they\u2019re bigger than ever.\u201d\n\nIn addition to snippets of several of her new songs, Kesha shares her positive new outlook on (the after)life. \u201cI have seen the light. Life is like driving across the country in a pretty small Astro van with your whole family in it for like 90 years,\u201d she muses. \u201cBecause I think life is a vacation from where we go when we die.\u201d", "description": "Kesha alludes to alleged abuse at the hands of Dr. Luke, her lawsuit against him and her last album rainbow in the new trailer for her upcoming album High Road.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/21-Kesha-High-Road.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
