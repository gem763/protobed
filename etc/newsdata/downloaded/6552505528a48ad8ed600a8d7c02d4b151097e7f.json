I just sat alone at home, with an eating disorder.\u201d\n\nShe said she had not been open about her diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum in order to \u201chide\u201d behind it, but because she knew \u201cmany ignorant people still see it as an \u2018illness\u2019, or something negative\u201d.\n\nWelcome to the US, Greta.

And then you know you\u2019re winning!\u201d she wrote, using the hashtag #aspiepower.\n\nWhile acknowledging that her diagnosis has limited her before, she said it \u201csometimes makes me a bit different from the norm\u201d and she sees being different as a \u201csuperpower\u201d.\n\nGreta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) I'm not public about my diagnosis to \"hide\" behind it, but because I know many ignorant people still see it as an \"illness\", or something negative. And believe me, my diagnosis has limited me before. >\n\nAsperger\u2019s syndrome was named after the Austrian paediatrician, Hans Asperger, who, in the 1940s, described some of its characteristics, including difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, including difficulties reading body language. In 2013, Asperger\u2019s was folded into the wider diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.\n\nTony Attwood, a world authority on Asperger\u2019s, has said people diagnosed are \u201cusually renowned for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined and having a strong sense of social justice\u201d.\n\nBoys are more widely diagnosed than girls.\n\nThunberg was diagnosed four years ago. She has acknowledged that her passion for her climate crisis work was partly down to viewing the world in stark terms.\n\nIn July, Thunberg hit back at the Australian News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt for writing a deeply offensive column that mocked her diagnosis.\n\nHe criticised her two-week trip across the Atlantic on a solar-powered yacht because, he said \u201cshe refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane\u2019s global warming gasses\u201d.\n\nBolt repeatedly referred to Greta\u2019s mental health, saying she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d.\n\nThunberg responded by tweeting that she was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by the the \u201chate and conspiracy campaigns\u201d run by climate deniers like Bolt.\n\nGreta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) I am indeed \u201ddeeply disturbed\u201d about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on and on just because we children communicate and act on the science.
