A terrible communicator!\u201d\n\nTrump has frequently pressed the Fed to aggressively cut rates. Powell has said the Fed makes decisions independent of political considerations.

Speaking in California, he told reporters details would be announced over the next 48 hours.\n\nTrump spoke after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the weekend attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure an \u201cact of war\u201d and an Iranian attack. Iran has denied responsibility.\n\nThe U.S. already has numerous sanctions on Iran, having reimposed penalties that had been lifted as part of the Iranian nuclear deal.\n\nOil futures were lower for a second day in a row Wednesday. Both West Texas Intermediate CLV19, +0.12% and Brent BRNX19, -0.08% crude shot up Monday in the wake of the weekend attack in Saudi Arabia.\n\nO\u2019BRIEN REPLACING BOLTON\n\nTrump, traveling in California for fundraising events, also tweeted that he\u2019d named Robert O\u2019Brien to replace John Bolton as national security adviser. O\u2019Brien has been Trump\u2019s special envoy for hostage affairs and may best be known for his efforts to win the release of American rapper A$AP Rocky from a jail in Sweden.\n\nTrump ousted Bolton on Sept. 10 amid disagreements over several foreign-policy issues.\n\nEMISSIONS WAIVER\n\nOn the same day he was visiting the state, Trump tweeted that his administration was revoking California\u2019s federal waiver to set its own auto emissions standards. He said the move would produce cheaper but safer cars.\n\nAs The Wall Street Journal reports, the White House proposed the revocation last year as part of an effort to revise fuel-economy rules for car companies that were set in 2012 under the Obama administration. The chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board said the state would sue the Trump administration to protect its waiver, the Journal said.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump ripped the Federal Reserve after the central bank cut interest rates by a quarter point Wednesday, as he ordered more sanctions on...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR410_19trum_ZG_20190916192129.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
