Right up to the point when the Los Angeles Rams splurged themselves right back into it.\n\n\n\nBut when the Ramsey deal finally came together this week for Khan and the Jaguars \u2014 netting the team two first-round draft picks and a fourth-rounder on Tuesday \u2014 league sources familiar with the deal said it really came down to a pair of factors: The team owner had to stay the course with the current front-office structure; and then he had to refuse to cave on a rich asking price until one of a handful of interested teams reached a sense of urgency.\n\nJalen Ramsey got his ticket out of Jacksonville on Tuesday. He's now a Los Angeles Ram.

This despite Ramsey repeatedly telling the Jaguars he wanted to be traded, while simultaneously appearing to hunt for reasons to stay off the field without exhibiting behavior that could be considered \u201cconduct detrimental to the team.\u201d Sources said Khan believed that if he could get Coughlin and Ramsey together, the team owner was capable of mediating the situation and repairing a rift that deepened during a September meeting between Coughlin and Ramsey that went sideways. The fallout from that meeting apparently not only triggered Ramsey asking for a trade, but also put Coughlin into a mindset that he was willing to make it happen for the right price.\n\nStory continues\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, download it here.]\n\n\n\nSources said there were also other driving forces behind Khan\u2019s motivations. First, he was reticent to lose Ramsey, a cornerback he firmly believed was one of the best defensive talents in football and also worthy of a massive contract extension. And second, Khan felt like the teams inquiring about Ramsey\u2019s services were initially trying to get Ramsey at a discount \u2014 despite other high-level talents like edge rusher Khalil Mack and offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil setting the trade standard at multiple draft picks (including at least two first-rounders).\n\n\n\nIf teams weren\u2019t at least willing to come to the table with the proper offer, Khan wasn\u2019t going to entertain a Ramsey deal. Instead, he was going to be patient and try to repair the situation. That was a reality that frustrated some of the teams that had called the Jaguars, believing they were motivated to trade Ramsey initially and then suddenly not motivated when Khan took the controls. Among the franchises that had talks of substance with Jacksonville in September were the Philadelphia Eagles, Baltimore Ravens and New Orleans Saints. In September, none were willing to part with the kind of draft haul Khan sought \u2014 a price tag that wasn\u2019t just about receiving two first-round picks, but was also about the potential quality of those two first-rounders.\n\n\n\nSo what changed?\n\nRams\u2019 draft offer was too rich to pass up\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what put Khan over the top this week, but sources said it became apparent within the organization that Ramsey wasn\u2019t going to step on the field for the Jaguars before the Oct. 29 trade deadline. And that reality was going to make the situation with Coughlin only worse. All of which made the decision to work with the Rams on a deal that much easier. Particularly when Los Angeles fell to 3-3 and had a whiff of desperation \u2014 not to mention the look of a team that could also continue to struggle in some areas even after acquiring Ramsey.\n\n\n\nOnce Khan knew he likely had his maximum offer on the table for Ramsey \u2014 and also knew that Ramsey\u2019s relationship with Coughlin was going to get worse as the cornerback continued to miss games \u2014 all that remained was making a tough decision. Ultimately, this was about the picks and Khan\u2019s unwillingness to fire Coughlin for a single player who couldn\u2019t get along with him.\n\nWhat does deal mean for Tom Coughlin?\n\nSources familiar with the rift between Coughlin and Ramsey also believe that the trade isn\u2019t a signal that Coughlin\u2019s future is safe. The sources said that even with the picks in hand, Khan remains conflicted about dealing one of the best players drafted during his era as the Jags owner.\n\n\n\nAll of which means the pressure is on Coughlin to prove that he can steer a 2-4 start back toward something positive in 2019. Or in the best-case scenario, recapture some of that spark from the 2017 season \u2014 which seems like it happened a lifetime ago. Whatever Coughlin does from this day forward and however he does it, Ramsey won\u2019t be a part of it.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely two first-round picks will ever make Khan forget that.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "None were willing to part with the kind of draft haul that Jags owner Shad Khan sought \u2014 a price tag that was also about quality of two first-rounders.", "authors": ["Charles Robinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ytwZM88bBSFkuu2TUVe7Jw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zkVLmzm6CoIqEEhSYuQRug--~B/aD0zMTcwO3c9NDc1NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f32d2eb0-efe3-11e9-8bef-d77859f7933b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
