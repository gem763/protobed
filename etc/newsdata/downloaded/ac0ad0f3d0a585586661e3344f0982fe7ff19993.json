About 100 bullet trains connecting Tokyo with central and western Japanese cities were scrapped on Sunday, along with ferry services in Tokyo bay.\n\nAirlines have cancelled more than 100 flights scheduled on Monday while some coastal highways were closed west of the capital in Kanagawa due to the storm, according to local media.\n\nRUGBY PREPARATIONS AFFECTED\n\nThere were no immediate reports of serious injuries or significant damage but eight surfers were rescued amid high waves off Shizuoka in central Japan after they were swept out to sea, local officials said.\n\n\"Two helicopters were dispatched while special rescuers rushed out to sea,\" a fire department spokesman told AFP.\n\n\"We sent two of them to hospital but no one was in danger of dying,\" he added.\n\nSome department stores and amusement parks, including Tokyo Disneyland, closed earlier than scheduled due to the approaching storm.\n\nFaxai, travelling north at a speed of 25 kmh, was expected to hit northeastern Japan before fizzling out back to the Pacific.\n\nJapan is well used to severe tropical storms and typhoons during late summer and autumn.\n\nStrong typhoon Krosa lashed western Japan in mid-August, bringing strong winds and torrential rain that claimed one life.\n\nAnd in late August, heavy rains left three people dead when massive floods also hit western Japan.\n\nTyphoon Faxai comes just as teams begin arriving for the Rugby World Cup, which kicks off on September 20.\n\nThe French team managed to sneak in just ahead of the typhoon and reach their training camp near Mount Fuji.\n\nHowever, the Australian Wallabies squad found their preparations disrupted as the typhoon delayed their scheduled arrival.\n\nTournament rules say that if a pool match has to be scrapped due to extreme weather, it is classed as a draw, which could have a major impact on what is set to be a very close competition.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [TOKYO] A powerful typhoon with potentially record winds and rain battered the Tokyo region early Monday, sparking evacuation warnings to tens of thousands, widespread blackouts and transport disruption. .
