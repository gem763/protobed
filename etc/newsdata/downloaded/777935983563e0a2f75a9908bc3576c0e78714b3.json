But if you\u2019re a freelancer or a contractor then here are the things you need to know:\n\nYou are not covered by the Superannuation Guarantee (SG)\n\nNot having a legitimate boss generally translates to no SG. There are exemptions to the rule, of course, like if you\u2019re contracting then your contract employer may pay you super as part of your remuneration \u2013 it\u2019s always worth checking the terms and conditions of your contract. But if you\u2019re a sole-trader who works from home, perhaps in their pyjamas, and has to wait for client invoices to be paid, then you\u2019re responsible for your own contributions. Because if you don\u2019t pay yourself some super, then no one else will.\n\nConsolidation could be your friend\n\nI used to pick up a new super account every time I started a new job (which was worryingly often). What I didn\u2019t realise was that I was basically losing money by leaving little nuggets spread thin across seven different super accounts. If you haven\u2019t looked at your super accounts, you should think about getting onto it. It can be quite easy and could save you a lot of money on fees & insurance.\n\nJust a heads up before consolidating your super accounts \u2013 take a second to consider where future employer contributions will be paid, the other fees you may incur with the rollover, and losing your current insurance benefits from your existing provider(s) when the insurance is cancelled. It could make your life a lot easier in the long run.\n\nYou might be eligible for government stuff\n\nSome self-employed people might be entitled to some bonus co-contributions from the big guys in Canberra. Co-contributions are exactly what they sound like; the Government will make a contribution into your regulated My Super or choice superannuation account. It all depends on age and income and current super status but you never know, it\u2019s worth checking the ATO site here.\n\nYou can make super part of your business plan\n\nIf your business is an incorporated company and it employs you, then the company has to pay you the SG (9.5% of your income). But if you\u2019re a sole trader or partner, it\u2019s optional. That doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t though. An easy way to guarantee life savings is just to factor it into your overall business plan, much like paying your taxes. Think of it as a life necessity and it will become far less overwhelming.\n\nThere is a super account out there for everyone\n\nTreat your choice of super account like Cinderella\u2019s shoe and find the one that fits, because there are a lot out there. Don\u2019t take the decision lightly \u2013 every fund offers different investment options and benefits, and charge different fees.", "description": "If you take a long hard look into your future, what do you see when it comes to financial stability?", "authors": ["Ronelle Welton", "Bill Nimorakiotakis", "Chris Jager"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/l/2019/10/iStock-494891525.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
