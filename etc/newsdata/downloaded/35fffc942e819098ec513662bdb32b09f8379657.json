Don\u2019t worry, the Wall Street Journal suggests in its lead editorial, the president is too much of a bungler to pull off any high crimes.\n\n\u201cIt may turn out that while Mr. Trump wanted a quid-pro-quo policy ultimatum toward Ukraine, he was too inept to execute it,\u201d the WSJ opines. That\u2019s supposed to let the president off the hook; after all, \u201cimpeachment for incompetence would disqualify most of the government, and most Presidents at some point or another.\u201d\n\nIf this is the best they\u2019ve got, it doesn\u2019t look good for President Trump. Incompetence is no defense when it comes to high crimes and misdemeanors. The Nixon crew botched most of the schemes it undertook, from the Watergate caper to the attempt to audit the president\u2019s political enemies. That didn\u2019t save Richard Nixon from being driven from office via the impeachment process.\n\nTrue enough, President Trump\u2019s pratfalling management style has so far limited his ability to commit abuses. For example, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report suggests that the president isn\u2019t any good at obstruction of justice: his \u201cefforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful\u2026largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.\u201d Even Corey Lewandowski had enough brains not to help him out by passing messages to his estranged attorney general, Jeff Sessions.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that Richard Nixon was a lot more on the ball than Donald Trump. You couldn\u2019t just steal stuff off the 37th president\u2019s desk and assume he\u2019d forget about it. If Nixon told you to break into into the Brookings Institution and take their copy of the Pentagon Papers, you at least had to come up with a plan\u2014in this case, firebombing the think-tank as a distraction from the burglary\u2014even if you never carried it out.\n\nMoreover, Nixon had enough sense to know that the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape\u2014which revealed that the president scheming to get the CIA to quash the Watergate investigation\u2014was damning, and to sit on it until the very end. Trump, on the other hand, was apparently convinced that the July 25 call readout, where he asks President Zelensky to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens, would exonerate him.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not get carried away praising the Nixon crew\u2019s steely-eyed competence. These \u201cwere not very bright guys, and things got out of hand,\u201d as Hal Holbrook\u2019s \u201cDeep Throat\u201d put it in All the President\u2019s Men. Nixon, too, surrounded himself with screw-ups and repeatedly found his plans frustrated by bureaucratic intransigence. The \u201cPlumbers\u201d were anything but a model of competent tradecraft. The Nixon team had to set up the unit in the first place because the official state security agencies\u2014the \u201cdeep state,\u201d if you like\u2014were reluctant to carry out black bag jobs for presidents.\n\nYet repeated inability to consummate high crimes didn\u2019t save Nixon from being forced out under threat of impeachment. The second article of impeachment against him, passed by the House Judiciary Committee in July 1974, focuses on abuse of power, including his attempts to misuse the CIA and turn the IRS against his political rivals. But Nixon never managed to get the CIA to stop the Watergate investigation, and the administration\u2019s effort to \u201cscrew our political enemies\u201d with IRS audits was a total failure. IRS commissioner Johnnie Walters flatly refused to carry out the scheme. Even so, attempting to corrupt the IRS was the first charge listed in Nixon\u2019s second article of impeachment.\n\nImpeachment\u2019s purpose, constitutional scholar Greg Weiner explains, is \u201cprophylactic,\u201d not punitive: to protect the body politic from officials whose conduct presents an unacceptable risk. Nowhere is it written that you have to wait until the abuse is actually completed and the damage has been done.\n\nGene Healy is a vice president at the Cato Institute and author of Indispensable Remedy: The Broad Scope of the Constitution\u2019s Impeachment Power.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Nixon_Trump.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
