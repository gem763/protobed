Probably not, because I felt there were more important things than a game of rugby.\"\n\nEarly in the 1981 tour, a Springbok match against Waikato in Hamilton was cancelled after demonstrators invaded the pitch.\n\nPolice responded with increasingly brutal tactics, staging baton charges on crowds outside parliament in Wellington in what became known as \"The Battle of Molesworth Street\".\n\nProtestors in turn became more radical, arming themselves with clubs and bats, while donning motorcycle helmets and makeshift body armour for protection.\n\nFor the final Test in Auckland, more than 2 100 police - about 40 percent of the entire national force - faced off against 7 000 protestors outside an Eden Park stadium ringed with razor wire.\n\nProtestors buzzed the ground with a single-engine Cessna dropping flour-bombs, felling All Blacks prop Gary Knight with a direct hit to the head but failing to stop the match.\n\nThe divisions caused by New Zealand rugby's stance took years to heal and damaged the game's standing among Kiwis.\n\nWhen New Zealand hosted the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987, the-then prime minister David Lange was still so disillusioned with the sport that he refused to attend.\n\nRichards said that while the protests did not halt the 1981 tour, they played an important role in highlighting the global opposition to apartheid.\n\nHe said the anti-apartheid movement also created a generation of activists, acting as a springboard for change in areas such as gay rights, abortion reform, recognition of Maori and nuclear disarmament.\n\n\"The passion that had been built up in the preceding decade found an escape valve in 1981,\" he said. \"It proved to be a real engine room for social change that helped shape New Zealand.\"\n\nBurgess remained estranged from rugby until 1994, when he watched a Springbok team that was touring New Zealand with the blessing of South Africa's newly elected president, Nelson Mandela.\n\n\"I was on the right side of politics,\" he told AFP, revealing his relationship with rugby was now sufficiently repaired for him to follow how his old team were faring in Japan.\n\n\"I've watched a little,\" he said with a twinkle in his eye. \"Just enough to know the All Blacks will win.\"", "description": "As New Zealanders unite behind the All Blacks' Rugby World Cup defence, activists recall when the team's links to apartheid-era SA split the nation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9363/cde3d0584304496faf583baac844fe99.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
