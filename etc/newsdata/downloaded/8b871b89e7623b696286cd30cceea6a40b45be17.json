[Photo/Agencies]\n\nSHENZHEN - World No 3 Naomi Osaka has withdrawn from the Shiseido WTA Finals Shenzhen with what has been reported as a right shoulder injury.\n\nAlternate Kiki Bertens, the world No 10, will replace Osaka for her remaining matches and will take the court at 6:30 pm local time Tuesday to play Ashleigh Barty.\n\n\"I'm disappointed to have to withdraw from the Finals,\" Osaka said. \"It has been a great event in Shenzhen, and it's the biggest WTA event of the year. This is not how I wanted to end this tournament or my season. I look forward to getting healthy and hope to be back here in Shenzhen next year,\" Osaka said.\n\nAs an alternate, Bertens is able to advance to the semifinals. The final round robin group standings are determined by the greatest number of match wins followed by the greatest number of matches played, meaning that if Bertens were to finish with an equal number of match wins but fewer matches played, the other player would advance.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8ef03a310cf3e97a3842d.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
