To reward his compassionate act, The Walt Disney Company invited Bell and his family to a VIP getaway so his birthday wish could still come true.\n\nBell, who lives in Jacksonville, Fla., was in South Carolina visiting his grandmother when he used his birthday money to buy hot dogs, chips and water for coastal South Carolina evacuees instead of saving it for his birthday trip to Walt Disney World. Bell's generosity moved many and he made headlines across the nation.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be generous and live to give,\u201d Bell told WJBF on Sept. 3.\n\nJermaine Bell, a 7-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla., visited Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Sept. 27, 2019.

Mickey Mouse, along with Walt Disney World cast members, surprised Bell at his home to invite him and his family to a special getaway to Walt Disney World Resort for a weekend later in the month, where he would be able to enjoy all four of the resort's theme parks.\n\nOver the weekend, Bell and his family visited the theme parks and were even able to watch Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party at the Magic Kingdom, according to Disney Parks Blog.\n\nBell's favorite part of the trip was visiting Disney's Animal Kingdom. He told WJBF that he had hoped to see lots of lions and have a Lion King party\u2014but he was treated to so much more during his VIP trip.\n\nJermaine Bell, a 7-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla., visited Disney's Animal Kingdom at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., Sept. 27, 2019.

Even during Bell's visit to the park, some guests recognized him.\n\n\u201cIn our family, we are givers and it just makes me overjoyed to see that at such an early age that he has grasped those values,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could\u2019ve known that something as simple as him being generous would\u2019ve blown up and affected so many people.\u201d\n\nYahoo Lifestyle was unable to immediately locate Creech for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Jermaine Bell, who donated is birthday money to hurricane evacuees still had his seventh birthday wish fulfilled when he went on a trip to Walt Disney World this weekend.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NNp1621BcjgEHUuEPVLCxg--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/c8575f30-e3d1-11e9-a97e-9dbbd801034f", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
