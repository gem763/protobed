The survey asked participants a set a four questions on suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\nBlack girls and boys reported concerning suicide attempt increases. Though adolescent girls saw a significant decrease overall in reported suicide attempts, there was a significant increase for young black girls. There was also an increase in the number of black boys who reported injuring themselves while attempting suicide, meaning they could be turning to more lethal means in attempts to kill themselves.\n\nThe study\u2019s researchers suggested a handful of explanations that could be behind the increase in attempts, offering fodder for future research.\n\nPast studies have shown black youth are less likely to receive mental health treatment than their white counterparts. Stigma against mental health treatment and depression in a person\u2019s social group and skepticism and mistrust toward mental healthcare providers may also be factors, according to the researchers. Finally, factors such as racial discrimination and poverty, which disproportionately affect black youth, could also play a role in depression, which can lead to suicide attempts.\n\nSelf-reported suicide ideation \u2013 thoughts and plans of suicide \u2013 decreased for all genders and racial and ethnic groups, suggesting that the rise in suicide attempts among black teenagers could be more impulsive, said Michael Lindsey, an author of the study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to contextualize behaviors that could lead to suicide,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cWe did not expect to see that black youth would be the only group to have the statistical increase [in suicide attempts]. Now begins the work of trying to figure it out.\u201d\n\nOver the past decade, suicide attempts and thoughts have nearly doubled for children and teenagers, with a rate of 6.7 suicides per 100,000 people in 2007 to 11.8 suicides per 100,000 people in 2017, according to the CDC. The agency determined that suicide is the second leading cause of death for teenagers ages 15 to 19.\n\nRecent studies have just started to scrape the surface of the role race plays in suicide rates. Native American and Alaskan Natives have the highest suicide rate among boys and girls, followed by white girls and boys.\n\nBlack boys and girls have typically had lower rates of suicide than their white counterparts, but the new study adds to research published within the last five years that shows suicide rates and attempts are increasing among black children. Black children, particularly black boys aged five to 11, have seen increased rates of suicide, while the suicide rates for black children aged five to 12 has doubled compared to their white counterparts.", "description": "Researchers found a 73% increase for black boys and girls in high school who took surveyed between 1991 and 2017", "authors": ["Lauren Aratani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc47fde29d33a7a4af73a630fab800ef10551c7e/0_0_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e678d74b7f7d7ec50ebceed8df62bead", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
