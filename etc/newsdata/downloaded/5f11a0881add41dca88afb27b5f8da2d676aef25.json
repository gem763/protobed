REUTERS/Mark Blinch\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, trading in a narrow range ahead of interest rate decisions on both sides of the border that could see the Federal Reserve policy rate dip below the Bank of Canada\u2019s.\n\nThe Bank of Canada, which announces its policy decision at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), is likely to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.75% in its first policy announcement since last week\u2019s federal election, despite signs that investors seeking higher-yielding currencies are shifting more money into Canadian dollars.BOCWATCH\n\nThe Fed will announce its interest rate decision later in the day. It is expected to ease for the third time since July, which could lower the range for its policy rate to below the Bank of Canada\u2019s equivalent rate for the first time since December 2016. FEDWATCH\n\nAt 9:02 a.m. (1302 GMT), the Canadian dollar CAD=D4 was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3088 to the greenback, or 76.41 U.S. cents. The currency, which notched a three-month high on Tuesday at 1.3043, traded in a narrow range of 1.3073 to 1.3100.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar .DXY rose against a basket of major currencies after data showed that American economic growth slowed less than expected in the third quarter.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures CLc1 were little changed at $55.53 a barrel, held back by worries about a possible delay in resolving the U.S.-China trade war. Oil is one of Canada\u2019s major exports.\n\nCanadian government bond prices were higher across the yield curve, with the two-year CA2YT=RR up 2 Canadian cents to yield 1.697% and the 10-year CA10YT=RR rising 14 Canadian cents to yield 1.587%.\n\nOn Monday, the 10-year yield touched its highest intraday level since July 16 at 1.628%.", "description": "The Canadian dollar was little changed against its U.S. counterpart on Wednesday, trading in a narrow range ahead of interest rate decisions on both sides of the border that could see the Federal Reserve policy rate dip below the Bank of Canada's.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446541737&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T15B", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
