(Christian Monterrosa/Associated Press)\n\nRoughly 600 firefighters faced a challenging battle with the Getty fire Monday as strong Santa Ana winds picked up through the region. Before the sun rose, embers were being cast a mile ahead of the body of the blaze, igniting spot fires and homes. Thick smoke was visible across the Los Angeles Basin.\n\nFire officials advised residents outside the mandatory evacuation zone but still in the fire area to prepare to leave in case winds shifted the direction of the blaze.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous season right now,\u201d Terrazas said. \u201cWe have not had any significant rainfall for a period of time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re very concerned about these weather conditions.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re going to be here a long time\u2019\n\nMark Curry, LAFD battalion chief, stood on a cliff-edge patio bench in Brentwood with panoramic views of the charred remains of some of the most expensive real estate in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here a long time.\u201d\n\nHe said saving older homes with cantilevered wooden patios built over dense brush was proving to be a challenge for firefighters.\n\n\u201cHomes with concrete slabs, we can save those,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith low humidity and high winds whistling through dense chaparral and neighborhoods, emergency crews found themselves fighting fires along several rugged fronts.\n\nIt was Los Angeles County firefighter Norman Queen\u2019s job to keep a close eye on the fire behavior on the far side of a narrow canyon where a hand crew of 70 men and women was working to shore up defenses on areas doused with water from helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft.\n\n\u201cWithout those water drops, this fire would be completely out of control,\u201d Queen said. \u201cThey\u2019ve kept things cool enough to get boots on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe main concern now, Queen said, \u201cis to make sure there are no surprises \u2014 like fire erupting in the brush directly below those crews.\u201d\n\nThe blaze did some of its most serious damage along Tigertail Road, where elaborate outdoor Halloween displays of skeletons and pumpkin goblins stood like eerie sentinels as firefighters battled blazes at homes in the affluent Westside enclave.\n\nIt was still dark on Tigertail when firefighters first arrived, using hoses to douse hot spots smoldering near homes and sending rivers of water running down the street. A resident stood in his driveway in his bare feet as his wife spoke to police about where to evacuate.\n\nFiretrucks lined the street, smoke choked the air and ash rained down while residents hurried to pack valuables into cars. A woman pointed at a charred home on the street.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA few miles away, firefighters remained on Cloud Lane just off Kenter Avenue, keeping close watch as the fire marched down a hillside toward other homes. Hand crews used chain saws, pickaxes and shovels to create a containment line they hoped would slow the fire\u2019s spread.\n\nSupport our journalism Subscriptions make our reporting on wildfires and power outages possible.

Around 5 a.m., winds at nearby Franklin Canyon Park east of the Sepulveda Pass were 10 mph, with gusts of up to 17 mph and a relative humidity of 23%, which is fairly dry. As the day wore on, sustained winds from the northeast to the southwest continued to increase and humidity dropped into the single digits, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nSchwarzenegger, LeBron James evacuate\n\nThe fire was threatening some of Los Angeles\u2019 most affluent neighborhoods. Among those evacuated was former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lakers star LeBron James, who said on Twitter: \u201cHad to emergency evacuate my house and I\u2019ve been driving around with my family trying to get rooms. No luck so far!\u201d He later tweeted that they\u2019d found accommodations.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris told reporters her Brentwood home was under evacuation orders.\n\nAuthorities drove through neighborhood streets in the dark with flashing lights, ordering residents to leave.\n\nRay Vafa, 59, stood on his driveway along Kenter Avenue in the dark, where the mandatory evacuation had left the neighborhood empty. Across the street, smiling pumpkin and ghost decorations were still sitting on a front lawn. Strong winds whipped ghosts strung up in trees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just waiting it out,\u201d he said. His wife and their poodle, Charlie Brown, had left earlier in the morning after they received the alerts. Vafa wasn\u2019t too worried when the first notification arrived. In the 20 years they\u2019ve lived in their home, they\u2019ve never been under a mandatory evacuation order, he said.\n\nFarther down the street, a man who declined to give his name watched firetrucks lining Sunset Boulevard. The Brentwood resident was on the phone, trying to figure out whether he should leave. He had two cars and wasn\u2019t going to be able to drive them both.\n\n\u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do with my Ferrari,\u201d the 47-year-old man said.\n\nOn the same street hours later, Julio C\u00e9sar, 20, and his mother, Perla Zacar\u00edas, 51, were stationed near a firetruck, handing out breakfast burritos and coffee to firefighters from their \u201cMy 6 Angels\u201d food truck.\n\n\u201cThis is part of our route,\u201d C\u00e9sar said. \u201cWe usually feed construction workers, but today we\u2019re feeding firefighters.\u201d\n\nMount St. Mary\u2019s University was surrounded by flames early Monday as the fire roared into neighborhoods, forcing the evacuation of the school\u2019s 450 students.\n\nDiana Rodriguez, a second-year business major at the university, was studying for her class on the principles of management when the lights flickered out for about a minute at 1:30 a.m. Five minutes later, she smelled smoke. But she had smelled smoke last week, drifting south from the Tick fire in Santa Clarita. She figured whatever fire was burning now was similarly far away.\n\nThen, around 2:30 a.m., resident assistants banged on the door. Everyone needed to evacuate.\n\nRodriguez grabbed her laptop, phone, camera and chargers, stuffed her backpack with snacks and water, and left her dorm in pajamas. The sky was blood red.\n\n\u201cReally, really red and orange \u2014 pretty, but a little freaky too,\u201d she recalled.\n\nAsh floated in the air. Her eyes stung from the smoke.\n\nA firefighter watches a flames approach the Mandeville Canyon neighborhood during the Getty fire. (Christian Monterrosa/Associated Press)\n\nThey put on masks and followed a road down the mountainside. Some students griped about having to evacuate while others were laughing \u201ceither because they didn\u2019t know what was happening or as a coping mechanism,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nRhonda Taylor got back to her Palisades home around 1 a.m. Monday and was getting ready for bed when she saw images of a fire on TV. Taylor assumed it was burning somewhere in the San Fernando Valley, and even if it was closer, she reasoned, the blaze that broke out in the Palisades last week hadn\u2019t prompted an evacuation of her neighborhood.\n\nShe fell asleep but awoke around 3 a.m. to her phone ringing and the smell of smoke. Her throat was parched and her head hurt. She answered an L.A. County phone alert, telling her she needed to leave.\n\nAlthough she already had what she calls her \u201capocalypse bag\u201d in the car, Taylor was so nervous she grabbed extra toiletries, clothes and water. She put her Pomeranian, Bu, in his carrier, grabbed a 36-by-24-inch painting of her two children and swaddled it in pillowcases and loaded up her car.\n\nAs she drove to an evacuation center in Westwood, through smoke so thick it was like a deep fog descending on her neighborhood, Taylor cried, thinking of all the things she hadn\u2019t had the time or the space in her car to gather up in the night.\n\nWorth it? Resident unsure\n\nShe loves her house and the views it commands of the ocean. But she wonders whether it is worth living, as she puts it, \u201con the edge of fear.\u201d\n\nRobert Lempert, an expert on climate risk management and a Rand Corp. researcher, says there\u2019s a growing awareness in his Palisades neighborhood that these large-scale fires aren\u2019t anomalous. The Getty blaze and a smaller one in the Palisades last week are vivid demonstrations of this \u201cnew normal,\u201d Lempert said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to look at the risk maps and show them to your family,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another to get a knock on your door at 3 in the morning.\u201d\n\nLempert and his neighbors have taken steps to mitigate a fire\u2019s ability to blow through their streets, chiefly by removing dry brush that can become kindling for firebrands, which he described as \u201ca wind-driven sea of matches.\u201d\n\nFor their part, Lempert and his wife have cut down some trees on their property and trimmed back others, placed screens over their vents and installed metal skirts beneath their deck to shield it from embers.\n\n\u201cYou see it slowly taking place,\u201d Lempert said. \u201cBut the question is, are we doing it fast enough?\u201d\n\nThe speed of the fire \u2014 whipped by strong Santa Ana winds \u2014 took many by surprise as they rushed to evacuate. As the flames licked closer, some were reminded of the Skirball fire, which was sparked by a cooking fire at a homeless encampment and tore through the region in 2017. The cause of the Getty fire is not yet known, fire officials said, but Garcetti said authorities had determined it was not sparked by homeless-encampment fires.\n\nRoberta Shintani and her son, Kevin, were woken at 3 a.m. by their roommate, who told them police had said they needed to go. Two years ago, when flames lashed the hillsides above the 405, Roberta and Kevin had prepared to evacuate but ultimately weren\u2019t required to. This time, they had to go.\n\nRoberta gathered clothes and her laptop, Kevin grabbed his guitar and, with their two dachshund mixes, Mowglie and Baloo, they made their way to an evacuation center in Westwood. The streets were choked with cars. Debris whipped through the air.\n\nThe sky, which was glowing orange when they woke up, \u201cwent from bright to extremely bright in a very short amount of time,\u201d Kevin said.\n\nTraffic nightmare on the 405\n\nThe fire caused a traffic mess on the 405 Freeway, one of the Southland\u2019s main arteries. Shortly before 9 a.m., the California Highway Patrol announced the southbound lanes of the freeway were closed from the 101 Freeway to Sunset Boulevard. It was not clear when the freeway would reopen.\n\nWarnings and evacuation orders for the Getty fire stretch from the 405 Freeway west and north of Sunset Boulevard. (Los Angeles Times)\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state had secured a fire management assistance grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help ensure the availability of resources to fight the Getty fire. The blaze erupted as firefighters were battling other large fires across the state, including the Tick fire in Santa Clarita and the Kincade fire in Sonoma County.\n\nThe Kincade fire exploded overnight from 54,000 acres to more than 66,200 acres and was just 5% contained as firefighters headed into the blaze\u2019s fifth day. At least 96 structures have been destroyed, including 40 homes. No deaths have been reported.\n\nThe battle against that fire came as Pacific Gas & Electric Co. made the unprecedented decision to black out 940,000 residences and businesses, affecting millions of people from Bakersfield to Eureka, in an effort to prevent its electric lines from sparking new fires amid hurricane-force gusts.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is grateful for the ongoing support as we battle fires up and down the state in extremely severe weather conditions,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI thank our heroic emergency responders and volunteers for their tireless, life-saving work to safeguard communities across the state.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writers Alejandra Reyes-Velarde and Rong-Gong Lin II contributed to this report.", "description": "A wind-driven brush fire chewed through hillside communities on the west side of Los Angeles on Monday, burning homes and prompting widespread evacuations.", "authors": ["Hannah Fry Is A Metro Reporter Covering Breaking News In California.
