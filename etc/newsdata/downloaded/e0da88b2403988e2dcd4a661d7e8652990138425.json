At one stage, smoke from several fires could be seen above Hong Kong Island\u2019s iconic skyline.\n\nA protester, reportedly a grade 11 student, was shot in the chest in the Tsuen Wan district, north of Kowloon and is said to be in critical condition. In a statement cited by local media, a police spokeswoman said: \u201cThe police force really did not want to see anyone being injured, so we feel very sad about this. We warn rioters to stop breaking the law immediately, as we will strictly enforce the law.\u201d\n\nLive warning rounds were also reportedly fired in Kowloon after a group of officers was set upon by a large crowd. Authorities said 51 people had been injured, including two in critical condition and 96 arrested.\n\nDemonstrations began in the early afternoon, when pro-democracy politicians defied a police ban to lead tens of thousands on a march through downtown districts. Marchers chanted the democracy movement\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201dLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time!\u201d\u2014and sang \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d a song that many are calling the enclave\u2019s \u201cnational anthem.\u201d\n\nSaid Danny Wo, a taxi driver who joined the march: \u201cI wish for Hong Kong independence. I am not Chinese, I am a Hongkonger. Hong Kong is still a colony under this Chinese government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the 70th anniversary of China, so it\u2019s even more important to come out today,\u201d added Apple, a 17-year-old student protester. \u201cChina is getting more powerful. If China becomes more powerful other countries might experience something like what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong now. It\u2019s an important to come out and stop them,\u201d she told TIME.\n\nNicola, a 22-year-old protester, said the Chinese government needed to change. \u201cEssentially, it\u2019s a communist regime like North Korea.\u201d\n\nImages of Chinese president Xi Jinping were trampled on and defaced en route, and some were burned outside a Chinese army barracks in Kowloon. Many protesters also scattered paper funeral offerings.\n\n\u201cThis is for mourning for Hong Kong, because we are suffering, we are dying,\u201d said Anne, 35. \u201cMany people in China are celebrating today but this is not a celebration for us. We are mourning for Hong Kong even though they\u2019re celebrating.\u201d\n\nAs marchers reached the financial district, many splintered off and pushed on to the heavily guarded liaison office of the Chinese government and began erecting barricades in the vicinity. Others occupied Harcourt Road, in the shadow of the legislature and the headquarters of the Hong Kong government, where they threw petrol bombs. Police responded with water cannon and the legislature was evacuated.\n\nLive news streams showed the storefronts of mainland Chinese-owned businesses, and businesses deemed to be sympathetic to Beijing, damaged and vandalized. A least one branch of Starbucks was ransacked (the coffee chain has become a target for protesters after the daughter of the franchise holder condemned the movement). The offices of pro-Beijing legislators, Junius Ho and Priscilla Leung, were also trashed, as was a branch office of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, a pro-Beijing party.\n\nPolice said that \u201cmultiple officers and reporters\u201d had been injured by corrosive fluid they say was hurled by protesters. By early evening, police were urging \u201cevery member of the public to stay in safe places [and] avoid going outdoors\u201d because \u201crioters have set fires and committed mass property damage, injuring many people.\u201d\n\nNational Day is a festive occasion in mainland China, but a source of tension and resentment in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, where most people, according to surveys, do not define themselves as Chinese but as \u201cHongkongers.\u201d\n\nAlthough the raising of the Chinese flag took place without incident at 8:00 a.m. local time, the public were not invited and VIPs attending the ceremony were asked, for security reasons, to gather at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center to watch the event on closed circuit television.\n\nMuch of the city was on lockdown throughout Tuesday, with more than two dozen shopping malls closed, at least 43 subway stations shuttered, and thousands of police on the streets.\n\nEarlier in the day, protesters unveiled a banner reading \u201cOct. 1 national day of mourning\u2014liberate Hong Kong\u201d from the summit of Lion Rock, a 495-meter hill overlooking the Kowloon peninsula that many in the former British colony regard as symbolic of the city.\n\nOther protesters hung a banner reading \u201c#NotMyNationalDay, Proud to be British since 1841\u201d at the entrance of the British consulate.\n\nSome had traveled from the neighboring Chinese territory of Macau to take part. Connie, a 29-year-old designer said \u201cIn Macau, most people support this.\u201d\n\nHer companion Cheng, 28, added: \u201cThere\u2019s no chance in Macau to do this, so if something like is happening in Hong Kong, we have to come and support it.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Wasserstrom, professor of history at the University of California, Irvine and the author of the forthcoming book Vigil: Hong Kong on the Brink, told TIME that the Hong Kong protests were \u201ca thorn in Xi Jinping\u2019s side.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIf this were to go the way Beijing would like it to, it would be a large military parade and spectacle that people would watch and think, \u2018Look how far China has come. Look how far China has come since 1949. But also, look how far it\u2019s gone since the period of Mao or even just a couple decades ago with how high-tech it is now.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, the protests, he explained \u201cimplicitly question whether China has really changed all that much since 70 years ago when China was under the control of a dictatorial one-party state that the communists claimed needed to be overthrown for a new China to be born.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to National Day, which this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, Chinese flags were burned and bunting and banners promoting the Oct. 1 celebrations destroyed by protesters seeking greater freedom for Hong Kong if not self-determination or independence.\n\nOver the weekend, protesters also lobbed petrol bombs at government offices and fought running battles with police, who responded with tear gas, water cannon, and live rounds fired in warning.\n\nMany in the democracy movement hold scant hope of an agreement with Hong Kong\u2019s current Beijing-backed administration.\n\n\u201cIf the government humbly listens to Hong Kong people, then we can resolve our political crisis,\u201d democratic lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting told TIME. \u201cBut right now, we cannot be optimistic since the Hong Kong government is so stubborn and arrogant.\u201d\n\nAsked what level of violence was acceptable to bring about concessions, a 23-year-old protester who asked to be identified as Matcha said: \u201cI think there is no line. For me, personally, I would not kill someone. Others might disagree.\u201d\n\nHong Kong has endured four months of unrest, sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed rendition of fugitive suspects to China for the first time. The initial protests quickly expanded into a democratic rebellion against the unpopular local government and Beijing itself.\n\nThe longtime British possession was retroceded to China in 1997 after 156 years of colonial rule, but its 7.2 million inhabitants remain culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Chinese\u2014differences that are sharply underscored on National Day.\n\n\u201cToday is the 70th anniversary of the birth of Red China, the birth of the regime that brought so much suffering to the Chinese people,\u201d said a 66-year-old retiree named Alfred, who had come on to the streets. \u201cToday is not a celebration for us in Hong Kong. Today, we are mourning.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Laignee Barron, Aria Chen, Amy Gunia, Abhishyant Kidangoor and Hillary Leung / Hong Kong\n\n\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Protesters in Hong Kong fought battles with police in a repudiation of Beijing's sovereignty over the enclave.
