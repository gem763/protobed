Both men have denied wrongdoing.", "description": "Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa admitted to misconduct involving stock-related compensation and said he planned to return the portion he had wrongfully received, Jiji news agency reported.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426328476&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF832HK"}
