Kennedy International Airport in New York. If it happens, it\u2019ll be the longest commercial flight in the world, a marvel of aviation engineering and \u2014 based on early reports \u2014 an absolute nightmare.\n\nThe flight covers 16,254km and takes 19 hours and 30 minutes in a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. That\u2019s about 800km and 45 minutes longer than the current long-haul route champion, Singapore Airlines\u2019 flight from Singapore to Newark.\n\nThere are all kinds of problems that come with sitting still in a lower-pressure, lower-humidity, louder environment than humans are accustomed to. As Qantas runs tests to find out how to mitigate those issues, they invited some journalists aboard to see what that kind of flight is like. A Bloomberg reporter on board notes the airline\u2019s attempt to reduce jet lag issues:\n\nOur plane has just left JFK International Airport, and it\u2019s already become a flying laboratory. Since the goal is to adapt to our destination\u2019s time zone as fast as possible, we click into the Sydney clock right off the bat. That means no snoozing. The lights stay up and we\u2019re under instructions to stay awake for at least six hours \u2014 until it\u2019s evening in Australia. This immediately causes trouble for some passengers. Down one side of the business-class section, six Qantas frequent flyers are following a pre-planned schedule for eating and drinking (including limiting alcohol), exercise and sleep. They wear movement and light readers on their wrists and have been asked to log their activities; they\u2019ve already been under observation for a few days and will be monitored for 21 days in total. Most of them are bingeing on movies or reading books, but one of them is dozing within minutes. To be fair, I feel his pain. It may be the middle of the day in Sydney, but my body is telling me it\u2019s pushing midnight back in New York.\n\nOf course, long-haul flights with crazy time changes are nothing new. And 19 hours and 30 minutes isn\u2019t substantially different from the 18 hours and 45 minute flight already in service today. The big problem, though, is that while the Bloomberg reporter says he felt fine and other passengers were able to sleep and eat good food and be generally happy, that won\u2019t be the experience for most people on board:\n\nThe plane\u2019s 40 passengers, including media, are all in business class: With so few passengers, nobody needs to travel economy. In an interview, Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce tells me the real Project Sunrise flights \u2014 if they go ahead \u2014 will have more legroom in economy than standard planes, and there will be some space at the back of the aircraft for stretching.\n\nSo unlike the guys \u201ctesting\u201d this flight in lie-flat seats with gourmet meals, most people will be sitting upright with a bit more legroom than usual on this day-long flight. That\u2019s a significant distance from Singapore\u2019s flight to New York, which only offers business class and premium economy.\n\nTo make an encomy section possible, they need a new plane. Part of the reason that Singapore doesn\u2019t have economy is that if you had a typical seating configuration on the A350 operating the route, there would be too many passengers and too much luggage. With the amount of fuel required to travel 16,093km, an A350ULR carrying a full passenger load would be over the airframe\u2019s maximum take-off weight.\n\nThe 787-9 that Qantas is using for the test flights also can\u2019t do the job as it currently stands, which is why so few passengers can be on board. They\u2019re even carrying lighter weight foods, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIncreased legroom and a stretching area will certainly thin out the weight a bit, but there\u2019s not much they can do to make this not awful. The one time I got to fly international business class, I realised at the end of the day I was still in a tube for 9 hours and still desperately wanted to be done with it by the end of the flight. I can\u2019t imagine over twice as long in an upright seat.\n\nBut Qantas is undeterred in its \u201cProject Sunrise,\u201d which aims to connect Sydney directly to New York and, eventually, London. Ultimately, there\u2019s no way that flying between New York or London and Sydney won\u2019t suck. The airline is betting that this\u2019ll suck less than two 10-hour flights with a chance to get delayed or stuck with a long layover.", "description": "Australian Airline Qantas is running tests on a planned direct flight between Sydney, Australia and John F.
