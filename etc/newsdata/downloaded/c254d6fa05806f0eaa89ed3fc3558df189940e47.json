Turki al-Malki, said Saturday's strike came from the north \u2014 not from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack. Both Iran and Iraq are to the north of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"This attack did not originate from Yemen,\" Malki said, \"despite Iran's best efforts to appear so.\" He accused Iran of working with its Houthi allies to generate a \"false narrative\" around the strike on two oil facilities.\n\n\"Secondly, the attack was launched from the north,\" Malki said, \"and was unquestionably sponsored by Iran.\"\n\nThe display took place shortly before U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on ways to deter Iran.\n\nPompeo blamed Tehran for the attack, calling it \"an act of war\" against the kingdom. \"The Saudis were the nation that was attacked,\" he said. \"It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\"\n\nPresident Trump has said that while the U.S. is ready for war, he wants to avoid it. On Wednesday, he announced that he had ordered the Treasury Department to \"substantially increase\" sanctions on Iran, and he later said details would be announced in the next 48 hours.\n\nIran has insisted that it had nothing to do with the attack that knocked out more than half of Saudi Arabia's oil-exporting capability. On Wednesday, Iran's defense minister, Brig. Gen. Amir Hatami, reiterated that denial, saying, \"These accusations are wholly, seriously and firmly rejected. It's easy to accuse someone without providing any proof.\"\n\nAs Malki sought to provide that proof, he said the drones and cruise missiles used against Saudi Arabia had originally come from Iran. He added that some of the weapons deployed don't have sufficient range to fly from rebel-held areas in Yemen to the targets in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBut the spokesman stopped short of directly accusing Iran of launching the attack from its own soil \u2014 something recently implied by U.S. officials. On Tuesday, two Defense Department officials told NPR that U.S. spy satellites had spotted drones and missiles being prepared at sites in Iran prior to Saturday's attack, which they called \"circumstantial evidence\" that Iran had launched the strike from inside its borders.\n\nMalki described the attack as part of a pattern of Iranian aggression.\n\n\"This attack was not against the kingdom [of Saudi Arabia],\" Malki said. \"It was an assault to the international community \u2014 an elaborate attempt to disrupt the global economy and the energy industry.\"\n\nSpeaking before a large international contingent of journalists and diplomats, Malki said a total of 25 drones and missiles struck the Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oil field on Saturday.\n\n\"The direction of the attack is coming from the north,\" Malki said, as a large screen showed images of impact points at the Abqaiq facility. He also showed what he said were surveillance videos from the early morning hours that showed the weapons approaching from the north.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Google/Screenshot by NPR Google/Screenshot by NPR\n\nStanding amid tables where rows of scorched and fragmented drone and missile wreckage had been laid out, Malki said, \"This is the kind of weapon the Iranian regime and Iranian [Revolutionary Guards Corps], they are using\" against civilian targets.\n\nHe said the weapons ranged from an Iranian delta-wing unmanned aerial vehicle to Ya Ali cruise missiles.\n\nIndependent experts note that the weapons displayed Wednesday in Riyadh look similar to known Iranian designs.\n\nThe cruise missile resembles a small Iranian-derived design known as the Quds 1, according to Fabian Hinz, a research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, Calif.\n\nAnd Adam Rawnsley, a reporter with The Daily Beast who closely tracks drone technology, quickly identified the delta-wing drones arrayed at the news conference as being Iranian in origin.\n\nSaudi Arabia has rushed to restore capacity to its oil infrastructure, pledging to fulfill orders despite the attacks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Saudi Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser said the company plans to restore production to full capacity by the end of the month. \"These synchronized attacks were timed to create maximum damage to our facilities and operations,\" Nasser said at a news conference in Jiddah.\n\nNPR's Geoff Brumfiel contributed to this report.", "description": "\"This attack did not originate from Yemen despite Iran's best efforts to appear so,\" said Saudi Col.
