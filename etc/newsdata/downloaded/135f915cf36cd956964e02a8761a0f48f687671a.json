It\u2019s not just a Twitter meme to pull out every time Atlanta adds a chapter to its tortured history in pro sports.\n\nBy the end of this season, three years will have passed since the Falcons coughed up a Super Bowl title they nearly had two arms around. And yet it\u2019s clear the cascading effect of that New England Patriots comeback is like a virus that has multiplied until it\u2019s finally taken over their entire system.\n\nThe Falcons are now 1-6 after their latest embarrassment, a 37-10 loss at home to the Los Angeles Rams, which means the season is over and the conversation will begin in earnest about when \u2014 it doesn\u2019t seem to really be much of an \"if\" at this point \u2014 they get rid of coach Dan Quinn and try something new.\n\nThough Quinn immediately walked off the podium from his news conference Sunday and into an embrace from Falcons owner Arthur Blank, we all know how this works in the NFL. Someone has to be held accountable for an Atlanta team that on paper was supposed to be one of the league\u2019s best but has played like one of its worst, and Quinn has all but run out of time to prove that he\u2019s not the problem here.\n\nHe acknowledged Sunday that he\u2019s delegated some defensive playcalling duties over the last two weeks, a move that hasn\u2019t worked particularly well considering the Falcons gave up 34 to the Cardinals and couldn\u2019t do much to stop the Rams. When asked whether he's lost the team, he acknowledged that it was a fair question when you look at the performances this season.\n\n\u201cYou spend most of your time trying to connect and trying to get the team to play like we're capable of, so the answer I\u2019d say is no,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cBut the disbelief at times of not playing like we\u2019re capable of, that can be very frustrating.\u201d\n\nBut again, it all comes back to 28-3. We know that in the NFL, the life cycle for every roster, except that of the Patriots, is short. You get the right pieces in place, you win games that increase the value of your players, you start bumping into the salary cap, you hit the reset button.\n\nWhen the Falcons got so close to a title with a team that they could largely keep together, they went all-in. They gave quarterback Matt Ryan a huge contract extension with a cap hit that explodes in 2020. They made Devonta Freeman the highest-paid running back in the league at the time. They locked up star receiver Julio Jones this summer for $66 million over three years. And they've used drafts since the Super Bowl to address their aging offensive line and fill in gaps on defense.\n\nIn other words, Blank and general manager Thomas Dimitroff made a very conscious decision after the Super Bowl: They had their team, and they were going to do whatever it took to keep it together. The problem is it doesn\u2019t score a lot of points anymore and has gotten worse defensively every year. Even if the Falcons wanted to clean house now, what could they realistically do other than call this a coaching problem and see if someone else can do better than Quinn?\n\n\u201cMy thing is, we take care of us,\u201d linebacker Deion Jones said. \u201cWe don\u2019t care about whatever the outside says. We still have to go back to work. We have (Quinn\u2019s) back, and we just have to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nBut whether the Falcons make a move on Quinn after next Sunday's game against Seattle going into the bye week or at the end of the season, it seems like there\u2019s a deeper issue the Falcons can\u2019t shake.\n\nNobody thinks that their players and coaches show up at work thinking about 28-3 or that it\u2019s in their minds when they\u2019re playing a game. It\u2019s more like that moment represents the peak of where the Falcons could go with this group, and yet they\u2019ve doubled down on believing in it even as the performance level has clearly eroded over time \u2014 NFC champion in 2016 to non-threatening wild-card playoff team in 2017 to 7-9 in 2018 to the bottom falling out on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhen you're not (performing), there\u2019s lots of reasons,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThat's where I spend most of my time \u2014 to look at how all three phases can get connected to do it, and when you don\u2019t, you keep digging for answers. I recognize when you don\u2019t play well those are fair questions, but I don't feel like we\u2019re ever out of the fight and until we do what we\u2019re capable of, my fight will always stay consistent.\u201d\n\nBut what the Falcons are capable of with these players now seems like a case of miscast expectations and foggy memories. The Super Bowl was a moment in time for this franchise, and now it\u2019s now well in the rear-view mirror.\n\nDumping Quinn is almost assuredly going to be part of the answer to finally moving beyond it. But given how much the Falcons have invested in the unrealized potential of its roster, that may only be the beginning.\n\nFollow Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken.", "description": "Nearly three years removed from their Super Bowl collapse, the Falcons are in a spiral that can be traced back to their failed opportunity.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
