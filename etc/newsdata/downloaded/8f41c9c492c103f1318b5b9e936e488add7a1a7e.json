But the company is hardly the only one at risk of potentially shortchanging some of its employees come retirement.\n\nAll across corporate America, underfunded pensions have become the norm. Even now, a decade after the financial crisis, the largest plans face a shortfall of $269 billion, right about where it was 10 years ago. Years of low interest rates have largely offset gains in the stock market. Companies haven\u2019t helped matters by lavishing money on shareholder rewards and clinging to assumptions about returns that proved to be too rosy.\n\nThe situation isn\u2019t likely to improve any time soon, particularly if interest rates keep falling. Even though a banner year in both stocks and bonds lifted returns on the largest pensions by 12% this year, their liabilities have grown even faster, according to consulting firm Milliman. And while GE\u2019s move to freeze benefits and set aside money will help trim its $22.4 billion pension shortfall by as much as $8 billion, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp said last month that low rates could boost those same liabilities by roughly $7 billion.\n\nIn other words, unless companies take even more drastic steps, they\u2019re currently doing little better than treading water.\n\n\u201cPlan sponsors are getting concerned that we\u2019ve had a historic equity run in the market and they\u2019re still sitting on underfunded pension positions,\u201d said Steve Keating, managing director at BCG Pension Risk Consultants.\n\nPart of it has to do with what\u2019s called the discount rate, which for corporate pensions typically corresponds to yields on highly rated corporate bonds.\n\nSimply put, the lower the discount rate, the less a plan assumes it will earn over time. That means the plan needs to set aside more money today to cover retirement benefits a company has promised to pay its employees in the years and decades to come. In August, the discount rate fell to an average of 2.95%, the lowest level in the 19-year history of Milliman\u2019s pension funding index.\n\nDefined benefit plans, like your traditional corporate pensions, have largely disappeared from view in the past couple of decades as companies have embraced plans like 401(k)s. Employers can opt to contribute to those plans, but it\u2019s the employees who are responsible for choosing the right investments and are solely on the hook if those investments fare poorly.\n\nNevertheless, there are plenty of older employees and retirees that are collectively still owed tens of billions of dollars in benefits that companies have failed to adequately fund.\n\nGE\u2019s predicament underscores the scope of the problem. On Monday, the company said it would freeze pension benefits for more than 20,000 employees and set aside as much as $5 billion to cover future obligations. (For those who didn\u2019t grow up with pensions, \u201cfreezing\u201d benefits essentially means whatever you\u2019ve accrued thus far is what you get from that plan, and no more, regardless of how many more years you work for that company.) And for GE, that helps reduce the amount they\u2019ll ultimately need to pay out.\n\nYet at the end of 2018, GE owed benefits to at least 600,000 people worldwide, amounting to nearly $92 billion in future payouts. Globally, its pension plans had just $69 billion in assets.\n\nTo be fair, many companies probably didn\u2019t expect interest rates, which fell to rock-bottom levels as a result of the Federal Reserve\u2019s crisis-era monetary policies, to stay so low. Outside of brief periods during parts of 2013 and 2018, when bond yields looked like they were finally about to return to historical norms, they\u2019ve kept falling. That\u2019s had real-world consequences for retirees who not only rely on a fixed income, but are also living longer as well.\n\n\u201cEven though the equity markets have done pretty well this year, it\u2019s been hard for them to make up ground\u201d because of low rates, said Beth Ashmore, a managing director for retirement at Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ: ) Plc. Despite the stock market run since the crisis, \u201cfunding levels really haven\u2019t recovered as much as everybody would have hoped.\u201d\n\nWhile many companies have plenty of money to plug or significantly reduce their pension deficits if they wanted to right now, others do not. GE has $32 billion in cash and equivalents, enough to wipe out its deficit (setting aside, of course, its many other debt obligations.) On the other hand, Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: ). has $6.4 billion in unfunded liabilities and just $2 billion in cash.\n\nSome have sought to transfer their pension liabilities to life insurers. The market for single premium buyouts reached $26 billion last year, according to data from industry group Limra. Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE: ). said that it struck deals with Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE: ). and Athene Holding Ltd. to transfer billions in pension obligations.\n\nOthers like United Parcel Service Inc (NYSE: ). have taken advantage of low borrowing costs to finance their pension contributions in the debt markets. Chipping away at a shortfall can help companies cut back on payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a government agency that helps backstop plans. The agency has been ratcheting up rates for companies that maintain pension deficits in recent years, in an effort to get them to plug those shortfalls.\n\n\u201cI think CFOs, in some ways, want to take control and start to thoughtfully reduce the size of their pension plan over time,\u201d BCG\u2019s Keating said.\n\nWhatever the case, it\u2019s often the employees who end up losing out. Freezing pensions has become a more popular strategy for companies in recent years. A decade ago, about 20% of Fortune 500 companies with pension plans in place since 1998 had frozen their plans, according to Willis Towers Watson. Since then, that figure has swelled to 42%.\n\n\u201cIn a situation of \u2018corporate battlefield surgery,\u2019 this tends to be a typical, if unfortunate, casualty,\u201d said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at Barclays (LON: ) Plc.", "description": "GE\u2019s Gaping Pension Deficit\u00a0Is Just a Tiny Part of Companies\u2019 $269 Billion Gap", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picca6f7458d4c9836137b05c0c68a316c7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
