Negative perceptions of the United States among the Iranian public are at the highest recorded level in over a decade of public opinion research conducted by the university\u2019s Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) and IranPoll.\n\nLong considered one of the most \u201cpro-American\u201d populations in the Middle East, 86 percent of Iranians reported unfavorable views of the United States, of which 73 percent reported \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d views. Perceptions of the United States were most positive in August 2015, shortly after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was agreed by Iran and the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China. As frustrations grew over the implementation of sanctions relief and following the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the deal negative perceptions steadily increased.\n\nIranians believe that US sanctions policy is intended to cause direct harm to ordinary people. While the Trump administration claims that humanitarian goods and supplies may freely enter Iran, 70 percent of Iranians believe that US policy intends to block humanitarian trade.\n\n\u201cAs the United States increases it pressure on Iran, Iranians are becoming more distrustful and disdainful of the United States, making them less likely to encourage their government to adopt conciliatory policies toward the United States and its allies,\u201d said Ebrahim Mohseni, a research associate at CISSM and one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\nBut the negative perceptions of the United States are not merely shaped by sanctions impacts. More fundamentally, Iranians are increasingly doubtful that the United States offers a model to emulate. In 2005, during the Iraq War, a Zogby survey found 37 percent of Iranians saying \u201cAmerica is a model country for its values and freedoms.\u201d Now, the percentage expressing that view has plummeted to 12 percent.", "description": "\u25e2 Three new waves of nationally-representative surveys conducted by the \r\nUniversity of Maryland paint a damning picture of the Trump administrations \r\npolicy towards Iran.
