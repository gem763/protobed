(David Richard, File)\n\nThere will be no pregame niceties between Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams when Cleveland and New York face off on Monday Night Football. On Thursday, Cleveland\u2019s star receiver called out Williams, who was the team\u2019s defensive coordinator and interim head coach last year before Beckham arrived for teaching \u201ccheap shots and dirty hits.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he expected the Jets to play man coverage against him, Beckham launched into his thoughts on the longtime coach.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m buying is probably just gotta watch out for the cheap shots and the dirty hits and all of the things that he likes to teach. That\u2019s pretty much all we gotta watch out for,\u201d Beckham said.\n\nBeckham\u2019s wariness seemingly stems from a 2017 preseason game between Williams\u2019s Browns and Beckham\u2019s Giants. Beckham suffered a high ankle sprain in that game, and on Thursday he said he believed Williams was at fault. Beckham said that current teammates in Cleveland told him Williams ordered his defense to target the star receiver.\n\n\u201cI had players on this team telling me that that\u2019s what he was telling them to do \u2014 take me out of the game and it\u2019s preseason,\u201d Beckham said.\n\n#Browns Odell Beckham says that dirty hit coached by Gregg Williams changed his life forever pic.twitter.com/CIrWLDQN8f \u2014 Mary Kay Cabot (@MaryKayCabot) September 12, 2019\n\nWilliams, who spent 2004 to 2007 as defensive coordinator with the Redskins, was suspended from the NFL for one year for his involvement in the Saints\u2019 \u201cBountygate\u201d scandal in 2012. A league investigation found that Williams had taken part in a system that offered defensive players financial bonuses for causing injuries.\n\nWhile the preseason hit only caused a sprained ankle, Beckham believes it led to a series of injuries that altered his career.\n\n\u201cThat high ankle sprain led to the, the broken ankle on the left and then, which led to conversations in many different areas, and kind of like a little spiral,\u201d he said. It's something that I'll never forget. It's something that, it changed my life forever, so I don't necessarily regret it, of course. I wish it didn't happen but it did. So, yeah, that led to the ankle, for sure.\"\n\nBeckham joined the Browns via trade shortly after the end of Williams\u2019s tenure.\n\n\u201cIf I was a coach, I would never teach what he teaches,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cBut that\u2019s just him and what he does.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nBrowns ban fan for dumping beer on Titans player.
