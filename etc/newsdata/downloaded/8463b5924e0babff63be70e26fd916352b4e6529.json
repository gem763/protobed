Cory A. Booker has met a self-imposed fundraising deadline to keep his campaign alive, marking the latest political stunt from the New Jersey Democrat who has shown a flair for the dramatic over his political career.\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s track record includes saving a woman from a burning building, rescuing a pooch from below zero temperature and likening himself to the gladiator \u201cSpartacus\u201d during a committee hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nThis time he sent out an SOS warning that his campaign was on the verge of capsizing if donors didn\u2019t pony up close to $2 million over the closing days of the fundraising quarter.\n\n\u201cThis moment is a testimony to the power of what\u2019s possible when people unite in common purpose and work toward a shared goal,\u201d Mr. Booker said Monday after meeting his goal. \u201cI\u2019m staying in this race \u2014 and I\u2019m in it to win.\n\n\u201cBut this won\u2019t be the last mountain we have to climb on our way to the nomination \u2014 we have a lot more money to raise to continue being competitive with the better-funded campaigns in this race,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Booker\u2019s message of unity has been well-received at campaign stops and helped him score a slew of endorsements from state lawmakers in the early primary states.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t translated into support in the polls that show him stuck in the low-single digits.\n\n\u201cWith the exception of [former Vice President Joseph R.] Biden, [Sen. Bernard] Sanders and [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren, everybody is way behind and I truly believe the size of the field is having a detrimental effect on voters, that they are just not tuning in like they would be if this is a six or seven person race,\u201d said Jim Demers, who is advising the Booker campaign in New Hampshire.\n\nMr. Demers said the media also has limited resources to cover the candidates, so they focus much of their attention on the free polling front-runners and less on the rest of the pack.\n\n\u201cIt is kind of the chicken and the egg situation,\u201d he said.\n\nSupporters of Mr. Booker and the other lower-tier candidates take comfort in the fact that former President Bill Clinton was a blip on the radar screen at this point in the race in 1992.\n\nThe clock, though, is ticking.\n\nCandidates who have struggled in the polls have failed to secure invitations from the Democratic National Committee to the nationally televised debates, which have provided a major platform for candidates to strengthen their image and woo donors.\n\nA dozen candidates have qualified for the Oct. 15 CNN/ New York Times debate in Ohio by capturing 2% in four approved polls and receiving at least 130,000 unique donors, including 400 donors in at least 20 states.\n\nBillionaire activist Tom Steyer and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii are set to join the 10 candidates who participated in the September debate.\n\nThings are set to get harder from here.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee raised the bar to qualify for the November debate, requiring at least 165,000 individual donors, and 3% in four polls or 5% support in two polls in the early primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThe announcement put some of the campaigns on death watch.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was the latest Democrat to drop out of the race, winnowing the field to 19 contenders.\n\nActivists, meanwhile, say Mr. Booker\u2019s inability to break through has been a bit puzzling.\n\n\u201cHe has a very positive message and a can-do attitude, and I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Lynn Thomas, chair of the Belknap County New Hampshire Democrats. \u201cI just can\u2019t put my finger on it either. I have thought about it a lot and I have talked to a lot of people and nobody knows why.\u201d\n\nOthers said that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden has sucked a lot of oxygen out of the room, particularly for voters who are looking for something other than a far-left firebrand.\n\nNew Hampshire state Rep. David J. Luneau said there is still time for Mr. Booker to make an impression on voters, including those planning to turnout for New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary.\n\n\u201cI think his message does resonate here in the Granite State and I think he has broad appeal as well, and another thing I think to keep in mind that it is still early,\u201d said Mr. Luneau said. \u201cPeople are just getting past the summer time.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
