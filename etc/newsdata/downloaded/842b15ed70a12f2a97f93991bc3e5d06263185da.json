The support measures would ultimately increase the \"probability of a fiscal deficit\", but the government's finances were strong, he said.\n\nA government colleague said the best medicine for the economy would be fewer, less violent protests.\n\n\"If society could come to harmony, with less demonstrations, and perhaps the stoppage of violence, that would help even more than what we can offer,\" Secretary for Transport and Housing Frank Chan told the news conference.\n\nAs yet, there seems no end in sight to the pro-democracy protests, or the violent ways of hardcore activists who have fought with police, throwing petrol bombs and bricks.", "description": "Financial Secretary Paul Chan announced relief measures of HK$2 billion ($255 million) to support the city's economy, particularly in its transport, tourism and retail industries.", "authors": ["Weizhen Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106197070-1571794112421gettyimages-1177499638.jpeg?v=1571794195", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
