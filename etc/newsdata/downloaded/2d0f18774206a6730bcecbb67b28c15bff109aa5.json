Namely, what will happen with Trump\u2019s trade dispute with China if Washington is tied up in an epic political imbroglio.\n\nGiven the harm Trump\u2019s tariffs are causing for U.S.companies, consumers, and global markets, the president recognizes the benefits of reaching a trade deal with China. And the specter of impeachment could lead him to settle, just so he can declare a win.\n\nTrump \u201cknows it will play well, not only with the stock markets, but with the voters here in the U.S., that he\u2019s finally resolved this long trade war, this costly trade war for Americans,\u201d said Brett Bruen, president of the Global Situation Room and former White House Director of Global Engagement on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cYFiPM.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I think Beijing is looking at now \u2013 how can we extract some of those concessions on hard issues because Trump is so desperate on trying to secure a deal,\u201d Bruen said.\n\n\u201cBeijing is going to entice him with, perhaps, some splashy superficial compromises, but at the end of the day, the substance will not favor the United States in some of these hard issues we\u2019ve been trying to resolve,\u201d said Bruen.\n\nPresident Donald Trump steps off Air Force One after arriving at Andrews Air Force Base, Thursday, Sept. 26, 2019, in Andrews Air Force Base, Md.

But there has been no real progress on addressing the tougher issues, like intellectual property theft or forced tech transfers U.S. businesses must abide by in China.\n\nThe day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the official impeachment inquiry, Trump announced the initial details of a trade deal with Japan. Both countries agreed to $40 billion worth of digital trade and hope to finalize a broader agreement in four months.\n\nLosing significant international influence\n\nThe Global Situation Room, a non-partisan consulting firm, released a survey this week that found that 96% of former ambassadors and senior national security officials believe America has lost significant international influence under Trump. (50 diplomats took part in the survey)\n\n\u201cThis was a group of ambassadors and other senior officials who served under Republican presidents, Democratic presidents \u2013 this wasn\u2019t a partisan group and the fact that 96% of them say [this] was rather shocking,\u201d Bruen said.\n\nThe bombshell allegations in the whistleblower report released on Thursday detailing Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden during a July call hasn\u2019t helped America\u2019s image abroad.\n\nMore from Sibile:\n\nDemocratic lawmaker on Trump impeachment inquiry: \u2018We have no choice\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs might make your cheese more expensive\n\nHow Trump\u2019s tariffs are hurting swing states\n\nHere\u2019s what happens when your privacy is violated on social media\n\nDemocratic debate: Trump trade war treating workers like \u2018poker chips\u2019 in \u2018his bankrupt casinos\u2019", "description": "Trump says China wants a deal \"very badly.\"", "authors": ["Sibile Marcellus"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H3fK6Aap7sRbkRBRBE2XwA--~B/aD0zNDU5O3c9NTE4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4274bdd0-e085-11e9-bffd-b1c6386f7268", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
