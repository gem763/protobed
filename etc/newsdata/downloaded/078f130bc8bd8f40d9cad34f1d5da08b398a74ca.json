Dallas County Sheriff's Office\n\nOne man's shot in the dark last week turned into a fatal situation. James Michael Meyer, a 72-year-old man from Dallas, Texas, has been charged with murder after authorities said he fatally shot a suspected robber at his home and headed back to bed before reporting the incident two hours later.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, Meyer claims he woke up around 5 a.m. Thursday to the sounds of someone breaking into a storage shed in his backyard with a pickax. The arrest warrant affidavit states that Meyer went outside \u2014 shotgun in hand \u2014 and yelled at the suspected burglar to stop what he was doing or else Meyer would shoot.\n\nMeyer said he fired his gun when the burglar allegedly moved toward him. The burglar then ran toward a park behind the home, dropping his pickax in the process. Meyer said he then fired another shot \"into the night.\" He claims he did not know that he shot the burglar when he returned to bed following the incident.\n\nUpon waking up at around 7 a.m., Meyer thought he saw a \"black bag\" in the park and discovered soon after that the shape was the body of the alleged robber. He and his wife called an attorney for advice before reporting what happened to 911. Police found the alleged robber face down with a gunshot wound on the back of his neck, according to CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMeyer was arrested Friday and is being held on $150,000 bail.", "description": "James Michael Meyer claims he did not know that he fatally shot the burglar when he returned to bed following the incident", "authors": ["Li Cohen"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/29/45ee6051-20f4-43f4-b1cd-8e4041353fe9/thumbnail/1200x630/44cd169d0689ff9e02aa0c8012949719/michael-mayer-horizontal.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
