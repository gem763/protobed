In that scene in the first episode when Olivia sort of turned on me and started shouting at me, my legs were shaking.\n\n'I'm literally standing there like... I get so nervous. I can't control it and then I never know what I've actually said.\n\n'I come out of it and people are like, \"What did you say?\" I'm like, \"I don't know.\" It all just seems like a blur. I get so nervous. I hate it.'\n\nOh dear: Last month, the blonde beauties locked horns with over their mutual pal Shelby Tribble, who the former Love Island star believed led Tom McDonnell on\n\nClaims: During an interview on BBC's The Reality Tea podcast, the TV personality, 27, insisted her rival, 28, 'never liked' her, despite sharing the same management team\n\nWeeks after their first row, the reality stars engaged in yet another heated discussion during their cast trip to Marbella, where Olivia branded Chloe's pal Courtney Green a 'goat' and attempted to throw olives at her.\n\nLifting the lid on their fierce exchange, the Celebrity Sex Pod star explained: 'Courtney got involved because Courtney was sticking up for me. My bestie, she was sticking up for me and I think she ended up getting Olives thrown at her.\n\n'I know people made jokes as if it was just like one or two olives but that just was not the case. It was this whole dish and [Liam] Gatsby smacked it out of her hand, otherwise this dish would've gone flying. It was not just a couple of olives, I have to say that.'\n\nOpening up about where the pair stand now, Chloe said: 'So much has gone on this series, it is just a lot. I think it all stems from, I don't think Olivia ever liked me.\n\n'I don't really know why. I think just sometimes in life people just don't like each other and that is fine and she made it very clear that she didn't like me way in the beginning.\n\n'In the first episode, she just flipped for no reason. I stuck up for Shelby and she didn't like it and it was all a bit like high school.\n\n'I got so nervous, I can't control it': She became embroiled in a bitter argument with her nemesis at the beginning of latest series, which later escalated to an fiery 'olive-throwing' row\n\n'I think she didn't like that I stuck up for Shelby. It was a little bit like, \"Well, I'm a better friend to her than you are.\" As if she can't have more than one friend. It was all a bit stupid. I'm not in primary school, she can have more than one friend.'\n\nThe social media sensation admitted she sensed Olivia 'never liked' her, even though they'd often cross paths at parties with their shared management teams.\n\nTV star Chloe elaborated: 'It's really weird. Me and Olivia had been on the same management for a couple of years and so we'd always have management events or Christmas meals and stuff and I always thought we just sort of got on.\n\n'We weren't best friends but we always got on, we always had a chat, we'd always have a drink together at the Christmas parties and stuff. And then I left that management about three months ago and Olivia came on TOWIE and it was just, I don't even know, just standing there.\n\n'That day she just flipped and then she's said things like, \"Oh, she's never liked me.\" And I was thinking that's just not true, I always quite liked her, to be honest.\n\n'That was the embarrassing thing, that's what I always say to people, \"I always thought she was quite funny.\" She doesn't like me, that's fine, but... And then I just think from that it has just stemmed.'\n\nSupport: Elsewhere, the former barmaid appeared in great spirits as she joined pal Courtney Green at their friend Amber's Envy Shoes launch at Jin Bo Law in Aldgate", "description": "The reality star, 27, admitted her 'legs were shaking with nerves' when she and Olivia, 28, first ruffled each other's feathers on TOWIE.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19806610-0-image-a-105_1571258599171.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
