We\u2019ve been here before, when the same sorry excuses are trotted out for voting against something which should be anathema to the Labour Party. She and MPs like Jim Fitzpatrick, Ruth Smeeth, Jon Cruddas, and Gloria De Piero actually voted to make their constituents, some who live in the poorest part of the UK, worse off.\n\nThey failed to protect jobs and the economy; failed to protect each region and nation in the United Kingdom. They claim they are representing their constituents, but nobody voted for this!\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nMany in the North of England and in Wales were opposing austerity as much as unlimited immigration when they voted for Leave, now they are going to be force fed something even worse than austerity, by the very people they elected to look out for them. This vote was about them being scared of losing their jobs, hopefully their constituents aren\u2019t half so stupid as this lot think they are and will pay them back in kind.\n\nJulie Partridge\n\nLondon\n\nWe need a concerted effort against the traffickers\n\nThe tragic death of 39 people found in a truck in an industrial estate east of London speaks much louder than the number alone. The fact looms largely that heinous crimes are committed by unscrupulous smugglers who could care less about their \u201chuman cargo\u201d.\n\nMen, women, even young children, are easy prey for abuse and inhuman exploitation at the hands of human traffickers who work seamlessly through elaborate and well financed networks across the world.\n\nRising figures for deaths represent global miseries escalated by poverty, a humantarian catastrophe capitalized upon by ruthless and organized cartels.\n\nConsidering that the vulnerable fleeing folks usually hail from nations in the throes of conflict, choking the point of origin would be an impossible task to accomplish. Preemptive measures can be effective, but would require joint efforts by EU and other nations that are targeted by smugglers with the cooperation of countries that happen to be the preferred route for traffickers across land and sea routes.\n\nAtul M. Karnik\n\nNew York\n\nListen to Farage!\n\nNigel Farage gets minimal space from the broadcast media even though he has provided the best Brexit story of the week.\n\nIn the event of a Final Say referendum, he says we should vote against leaving. His argument is that the Boris deal is so bad that we would do better to remain and fight another day.\n\nThe case for the People's Vote gets stronger every day.\n\nTim Ambler\n\nNorfolk\n\nThe Meghan Markle abuse isn't hard to work out\n\nI would describe myself politically as anti-royalist but as a mixed race woman living through some of the most intolerant, jingoistic times in UK history, I have huge sympathy for Meghan Markle on a human level.\n\nIf the ignorant, rich white folk sniggering at the black minister who married her didn\u2019t give her a clue to how things were going to go down, I don\u2019t know what would.\n\nShe is the most beautiful royal we\u2019ve had, and yet is regularly slated for her looks. She has the most poise, but is slated for her demeanour. The family she has married into makes her own look like the Waltons and yet any family dirt the press can uncover is fanned by the greedy media.\n\nThere is one simple way to explain all this \u2013 it is an utterly toxic mix of snobbery and racism.\n\nAmanda Baker\n\nEdinburgh\n\nPraise for the Lebanese protestors\n\nThe mass protests in Lebanon build a powerful case for expanding the pillars of good governance \u2013 transparency, accountability and efficiency \u2013 across large swathes of the Arab world.\n\nThe simmering rage and disenchantment with the political elites was palpable, but not a single bullet was fired, no mosque or church was attacked and not a single divisive or racist statement was uttered.\n\nThe Lebanese people have therefore demonstrated unrivalled gallantry, fortitude and forbearance in the face of such social and political upheaval. Like Jordanians, they also bore the brunt of the refugee crisis.\n\nThe global community must leave no stone unturned in helping this great nation rising on its feet.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\n\nLondon\n\nThe Final Say is a family affair\n\nI wish to add my signature to the letter supporting the appeal for a public Final Say on Brexit.\n\nAs an 83 year old, proudly Welsh and European grandfather with three sizeable families, totalling 31 multilingual Remainers, I fear for both their cultural and economic prosperity if we were to leave the EU.\n\nDr David Gareth Edwards\n\nCardiff", "description": "It seems like some Labour MPs do believe you can polish a turd.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/11/get-ready-for-brexit-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
