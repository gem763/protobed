The EU has granted Britain a three-month Brexit extension until Jan. 31.\n\nWith Brexit now delayed, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his opposition party would vote in favor of an early election because the prospect of crashing out of the EU without a deal had been taken off the table.\n\nThat means the U.K. is likely headed for its first December election since 1923.\n\n\u201cFor the next three months, our condition of taking no-deal off the table has now been met,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going out there to win!\u201d Corbyn told cheering supporters.\n\nThe House of Commons is voting later Tuesday on the government\u2019s bill calling for a Dec. 12 election. Corbyn\u2019s support means it is very likely to pass, although opposition politicians could press the government to alter the date by a day or two.\n\nTo win support from opposition parties, Johnson has shelved his contentious EU Brexit deal until after the election.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party have proposed an earlier election date of Dec. 9 to reduce the possibility that Johnson could try to pass his EU divorce bill \u2014 which would allow Britain to leave the bloc and hand Johnson a major political achievement \u2014 before the campaign begins.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the 12th,\u201d said Liberal Democrat lawmaker Chuka Ummuna, who suggested his party could accept a compromise date of Dec. 10 or 11.\n\n\u201cWe will see what else they come forward with,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have got to break the gridlock.\u201d\n\nOpinion polls currently give Johnson\u2019s Conservatives a lead over Labour, but there\u2019s a strong chance that an election could produce a Parliament as divided over Brexit as the current one.\n\nAs it stands, Britain is not scheduled to hold a general election until 2022.\n\nVoters are weary after more than three years of Brexit drama, and all the political parties are worried about a backlash from grumpy electors asked to go to the polls at the darkest, coldest time of the year.\n\nIf Johnson does get an election approved on Tuesday, it will be on his fourth attempt. On Monday, Johnson proposed a Dec. 12 election under a different procedure that required a two-thirds majority in the House of Commons but lawmakers voted it down \u2014 Johnson\u2019s third such defeat.\n\nJohnson had accused opponents of betraying voters\u2019 decision to leave the EU and said that without an early election, the British government would be like the cartoon character Charlie Brown, \u201cendlessly running up to kick the ball only to have Parliament whisk it away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with this endless delay,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson took office in July vowing to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d after his predecessor, Theresa May, resigned in defeat. Parliament had rejected her divorce deal three times, and the EU had delayed Britain\u2019s scheduled March 29 departure, first to April, and then to the end of October.\n\nThe EU on Monday agreed to extend the Brexit deadline for a third time, this time until Jan. 31.\n\nJohnson, who said just weeks ago that he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than postpone the U.K.\u2019s leaving date past Oct. 31, was forced to seek the extension on Parliament\u2019s orders to avoid a no-deal Brexit, which would damage the economies of both Britain and the EU.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Britain appeared on course Tuesday for an early general election that could break the country's political deadlock over Brexit, after the main opposition Labour Party said it would agree to the government's request to send voters to the polls in December.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Kirka", "Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/Britain_Brexit_02405.jpg-e3148_c0-5-5472-3197_s1200x700.jpg?3c902df30b096d13482fa428703bfe6529a67ba8", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
