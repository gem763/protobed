REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nNo country can prosper without working with other nations, Le said at the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing, which China styles as its answer to the annual Shangri-La Dialogue security forum in Singapore.\n\nThe world wants China and the United States to end their trade war, he said. That required openness rather than a \u201cde-coupling\u201d of countries or a new Cold War.\n\nChina has been nervous that the United States is seeking to sever, or at least severely curb, economic ties in what has been called a \u201cde-coupling\u201d. Beijing fears that the Trump administration wants a complete separation with China.\n\nThe two countries have been working to resolve their trade dispute, with the United States announcing a \u201cphase 1\u201d deal with China on trade matters and suspending a scheduled tariff hike for October.\n\n\u201cAs long as we respect each other and seek equal cooperation, there are no disagreements that cannot be resolved between China and the United States,\u201d Le said.\n\n\u201cWhat China wants is to deliver a better life for the Chinese people. We don\u2019t want to take anything from anyone else. There\u2019s no such thing as China replacing anyone or threatening anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nChina and the United States have accomplished much through cooperation over the years, Le said. \u201cWhy would we toss away the achievements of such cooperation?\u201d\n\nHowever, Le also warned that China would never trade away its core interests or allow other countries to undermine its security.\n\n\u201cNo one should expect China to swallow the bitter consequences of undermining its interests, whether on the land or at sea, whether it\u2019s Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang or Tibet,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018SINISTER INTENTIONS\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry accused U.S. lawmakers last week of \u201csinister intentions\u201d to undermine Hong Kong\u2019s stability after they passed measures related to the anti-government protests that have rocked the city for months.\n\nThe Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, one of the measures passed by the U.S House of Representatives, would require the U.S. secretary of state to certify each year that Hong Kong retained its autonomy in order to receive special treatment as a major financial centre.\n\nChina would continue to safeguard its national security, Le said. The world had become safer and more peaceful because of China\u2019s development, he said.\n\nThe trade war and uptick in China-U.S. tensions have unnerved countries around the region, who fear both the impact on their own economies and being forced to take sides.\n\n\u201cFor small countries like Singapore, we watch with deep concern as larger powers position themselves more aggressively against each other,\u201d Singapore\u2019s Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said at the forum.\n\nThe world needed both China and the United States to ensure stability and deal with challenges such as climate change, nuclear threats and terrorism, Ng said.\n\n\u201cSingapore will maintain its strong friendships with both and avoid choosing sides. But it is also acutely aware that the farther the U.S. and China pull apart, the harder it would be for all countries to keep to this principled and neutral position,\u201d he said.\n\nChina's Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng speaks at the Xiangshan Forum in Beijing, China October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nIn comments to French news agency AFP in Paris, the Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi said the China-U.S. trade talks would not affect third parties nor come at the expense of China-Europe relations.\n\n\u201cAs the world\u2019s largest potential market, China is open to all countries,\u201d Wang said, according to a transcript carried by China\u2019s foreign ministry on Tuesday.", "description": "China and the United States have achieved some progress in their trade talks, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on Tuesday, and any problem could be resolved as long as both sides respected each other.", "authors": ["Ben Blanchard", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443605974&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L0CV", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
