We worried we\u2019d never get there,\u201d Ms Andrews said.\n\nA chance encounter with a financial planner changed the couple\u2019s view on the Aussie housing market and they decided to abandon the search for their \u201cdream house\u201d and snap up investment properties instead.\n\nBut first they had to claw their way out of debt. The couple had a lavish overseas wedding in South Africa and racked up additional debts on multiple travels around the world.\n\n\u201cWe had to get rid of all our wasteful expenditure,\u201d Mr Craig said. \u201cA lot of our money was going to things we didn\u2019t need.\u201d\n\nWith a strict savings plan locked into place, the couple then received invaluable help from Mr Craig\u2019s parents, who offered to let them draw equity from their mortgage as a loan to help fund their first deposit.\n\nThe couple used this to purchase a home in Ipswich in southeast Queensland, followed by another home in Toowoomba a few months later \u2014 both for about $420,000 each.\n\nBoth properties were dual occupancy, allowing the couple to get four homes for the price of two, along with four sources of rental income.\n\nThey sorted out accommodation for their own needs by buying and building a granny flat on Mr Craig\u2019s parents\u2019 property.\n\nThis allowed them to save even faster and they recently signed the paperwork on another dual occupancy property, this time in Redbank, an area between Ipswich and Brisbane.\n\nThe property includes two homes with a combined rental income of nearly $600 per week.\n\n\u201cWe realised Queensland was a much better place to buy than Sydney,\u201d Mr Craig said. \u201cThere\u2019s more development and infrastructure coming. It was just better for growth.\u201d\n\nPurchasing investment properties rather than a permanent home made the process of scaling the Aussie housing market considerably easier, the couple said.\n\n\u201cWe were stuck in an old mentality. You work hard and eventually you pay off a house,\u201d Ms Andrews said. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing that anymore and the way we did it was so much easier than we expected.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s financial mentor Graeme Holm of Infinity Group said most people in their 20s and 30s had an overly negative view of the housing market and had bought into the idea they would never be able to afford property.\n\n\u201cAll that stuff about smashed avo, it\u2019s a load of rubbish,\u201d Mr Holm said. \u201cAll it takes is old fashioned budgeting. You\u2019ve got to go back to basics, save hard, and delay gratification a bit.\n\n\u201cA lot of people struggle with that today because we live in a society of instant gratification and no one wants to put money aside.\u201d\n\nMr Holm added that younger buyers needed to get realistic expectations.\n\n\u201cYou may feel trapped out of the market if your expectations were not all that realistic. If you aspire to live in Bondi by the water, you might feel pushed out of a home but you\u2019re better off starting with what you can afford.\u201d", "description": "A Sydney couple who were recently still in debt have turned around their lives in just under three years and now own six homes after deciding to make a big lifestyle change.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/12100058/capi_38ce66a596f7819f8e102d9ed5edb8c4_02701919b8468fe309611a5eb6aa66e2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
