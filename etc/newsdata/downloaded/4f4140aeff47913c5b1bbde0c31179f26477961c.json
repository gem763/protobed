UPDATE 2-Oil prices steady as investors weigh demand concerns\n\n* Weak economic data fuels oil demand concerns pulled\n\n* Russia reports oil output above OPEC+ quota in Sept.\n\n* Saudi-Kuwait talks over Neutral Zone field 'very positive'\n\n\n\n(Recasts lead, updates prices)\n\nBy Roslan Khasawneh\n\nSINGAPORE, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices largely held steady\n\non Monday, recouping some early losses as investors took stock\n\nof global economic pressures that could impact oil demand.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures were down\n\n1 cent to $59.41 a barrel by 0648 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were\n\noff 2 cents at $53.76 a barrel.\n\nSigns of still ample global oil supply combined with\n\nconcerns about economic growth in China, the world's largest oil\n\nimporter, pressured prices lower for a second session earlier on\n\nMonday.\n\n\"Weakness in oil price reflected a bearish view of the\n\nglobal energy demand, as the slowdown in manufacturing and\n\ntrades seemed not to be ending anytime soon,\" said Margaret\n\nYang, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nRussia, the world's second-largest oil producer, said on\n\nSunday it did not meet its supply reduction commitment in\n\nSeptember because of an increase in natural gas condensate\n\noutput as the country prepared for winter. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\n\n(OPEC), Russia and other oil producers, an alliance known as\n\nOPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million\n\nbarrels per day (bpd) from the start of this year.\n\nAdditionally, talks between OPEC members Kuwait and Saudi\n\nArabia to restart oil production from joint fields in the\n\nNeutral Zone between the two countries, with capacity of 500,000\n\nbarrels per day could mean more supply returning to the market.\n\nKuwait's deputy foreign minister on Saturday said\n\nnegotiations were \"very positive\" after Kuwaiti media, citing\n\nunidentified sources, said the two Gulf oil producers had agreed\n\nto resume crude output from the oilfields. But any increase in Neutral Zone production from will be\n\ncompensated by a supply cut from other Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti\n\nfields as both countries are committed to their targets under\n\nthe OPEC+ output reduction agreement.\n\nWhile market participants believe OPEC+ could decide to\n\nextend production cuts in an upcoming December meeting, economic\n\nheadwinds are curbing bullish sentiment and fuelling oil demand\n\nconcerns.\n\nChina's economic growth slowed to 6% year-on-year in the\n\nthird quarter, its weakest in 27-1/2 years and short of\n\nexpectations due to soft factory production and continuing trade\n\ntensions.\n\n\"OPEC-led supply curtailment policies though lending support\n\nhas struggled to boost oil prices as markets fixate over\n\npersistent demand-side concerns,\" Phillip Futures analyst\n\nBenjamin Lu said.\n\nStill, a 9.4% year on year increase in China's refinery\n\nthroughput for September signalled that petroleum demand\n\nremained robust.\n\n\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 2-Oil prices steady as investors weigh demand concerns", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC9I0S2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
