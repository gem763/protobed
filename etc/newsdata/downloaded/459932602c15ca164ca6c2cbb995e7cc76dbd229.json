But they have unleashed something else, too: an increased risk of breaches resulting from data being moved and used in multiple places and in multiple ways. Now, a startup that has built a way to help safeguard against that threat \u2014 using homomorphic encryption \u2014 is announcing funding, a sign of market demand and the opportunity it presents for cybersecurity.\n\nDuality, which builds solutions based on homomorphic encryption \u2014 a technique that encrypts an organization\u2019s data in a way that lets it stay encrypted even as the company collaborates with third parties that also process the data \u2014 is today announcing that it has raised $16 million in funding.\n\nThe Series A round is being led by Intel Capital, with participation also from Hearst Ventures and Team8.\n\nTeam8 is the heavyweight Israeli cybersecurity incubator that counts Intel as a strategic partner and itself has an impressive list of backers that include Microsoft, Walmart, Eric Schmidt and Accenture.\n\nIntel is a financial and strategic backer here: last year the two worked on a project to expose the security challenges of AI workloads, which utilised homomorphic encryption on Intel platforms in order to minimise data exposure. Intel\u2019s are used in a wide range of use cases that include cloud services and massive hardware companies, you could see where the two might work together more in the future.\n\nOther companies that Duality works with are in the financial markets, healthcare, and insurance, although it says it cannot disclose who because of NDAs. One customer it did name was the CDA, the Cyber Defense Alliance, in the UK, a cross-bank security alliance.\n\nAnother is may well be Heart, the other investor named in this round.\n\n\u201cAs a leading global, diversified media, information and services company with more than 360 businesses across industries, we are acutely aware of the increasing importance of data and data collaboration in companies across many market segments,\u201d said Kenneth Bronfin, Senior Managing Director of Hearst Ventures, in a statement. \u201cSensitive data is constantly being generated by both individuals and businesses; there needs to be technology available that protects such data while allowing us to extract insights. We are excited by Duality\u2019s mission and its ability to deliver complex technology to real-world use cases and applications.\u201d\n\nThere are a handful of cybersecurity startups and larger companies emerging that are building solutions on the principle of homomorphic encryption.\n\nThey include Enveil, CryptoNext Security, IBM. Duality, however, has an interesting pedigree when it comes to the field: one of its co-founders, Shafi Goldwasser, won a Turing Award for her groundbreaking work in cryptographic algorithms that form the basis of homomorphic encryption.\n\nAs with a lot of high-level math, that work is largely theoretical, and so the work that Duality \u2014 led by its other co-founders Alon Kaufman, Rina Shainski, Vinod Vaikuntanathan and Kurt Rohloff, all of whom also have long lists of cybersecurity and data science credentials \u2014 has done has involved making the algorithms into something that is commercially viable and usable by most businesses.\n\nThat being said, there is still a lot of time and computing energy that are needed to process encrypted data, and so the idea with Duality is that it\u2019s used on a company\u2019s most sensitive information. With some of the funding going towards R&D it will be interesting to see whether algorithms can improve enough to extend that kind of encryption i a practical way to wider data sets.\n\n\u201cThere is no free lunch here,\u201d said Kaufman, the CEO, in an interview this week. \u201cHomomorphic encryption is the holy grail of security and privacy since it removes huge challenges. But there are overheads. When we deploy it with a customer, we don\u2019t say, from now on encrypt everything and assume nothing is open. That\u2019s because i\u2019s a storage and computational overhead. That is why we focus on sensitive data sets.\u201d He added that one of Duality\u2019s unique qualities is that its overhead is dramatically improved compared to others that are also building solutions on this principle, but all the same, \u201cyou apply it only when you need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ability to secure data during analysis is a critical component in the future computation stack, specifically in the context of AI. Intel Capital has been following the space closely, and we are excited to see secure computing and homomorphic encryption becoming practical and broadly applicable,\u201d said Anthony Lin, Vice President & Senior Managing Director of Intel Capital, in a statement. \u201cWe believe privacy-preservation in AI and ML represents a huge market need, and we\u2019re investing in Duality because of its unique founding team and world-leading expertise in both advanced cryptography and data science.\u201d", "description": "The ubiquity of APIs and cloud solutions have opened up a world of interesting ways for businesses to create a service without having to build every part of it themselves.
