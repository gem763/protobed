The Facebook pages targeted eight countries across the continent: Madagascar, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin: who is the man leading Russia's push into Africa? Read more\n\nAll were linked to Prigozhin, a Russian tycoon close to Vladimir Putin. The US has previously indicted Prigozhin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. It accuses him of running a global disinformation media empire and of funding the Internet Research Agency, the St Petersburg troll factory that boosted Donald Trump.\n\nFacebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said Russia used almost 200 fake and compromised accounts to reach more than 1 million followers in Africa. Russian-run networks worked closely with locals in order to disguise the sites\u2019 true origins, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a joining of forces, if you will, between local actors and actors from Russia,\u201d he told Reuters. \u201cIt appears that the local actors who are involved know who is behind the operation.\u201d\n\nIn recent years the Kremlin has made considerable efforts to cultivate support from African rulers. Last week Putin held the first-ever Russia-Africa forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, attended by more than 40 African heads of state.\n\nPrigozhin has led Russia\u2019s push in Africa. Mercenaries from Wagner \u2013 a shadowy private military contractor linked to Prigozhin \u2013 have been sent to the Central African Republic. Prigozhin entities have also established media outlets in several African countries and have sent Russian \u201cadvisers\u201d to help with elections.\n\nMoscow\u2019s aim appears to be to bolster existing governments and smear pro-western opposition parties. Documents seen by the Guardian earlier this year envisage grooming a new generation of African \u201cleaders\u201d and undercover \u201cagents\u201d, and pushing out former colonial powers such as France or the UK.\n\nFacebook said one fake network was centred on Sudan, where in late 2018 Russia tried unsuccessfully to prop up President Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed in April. Another \u2013 featuring 35 accounts and 53 pages \u2013 was run out of Madagascar and Mozambique. A third was focused on Libya.\n\nThe campaigns shut down for meddling in Africa had posted about local news and geopolitical issues, as well as sharing content from local and Russian state media including Sputnik and RT. Some of the accounts were active as far back as 2014, Facebook said.\n\nThe company did not identify which accounts had been suspended. The Guardian found that the Facebook page of a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar\u2019s capital, Antananarivo, was no longer working.\n\nAlso not working was the account for Afric, a South Africa-based website previously linked with a Russian attempt to meddle in the country\u2019s recent election by backing the ruling African National Congress. The campaign appears to have had little impact.\n\nResearchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the research lab at Stanford University, said the networks used a variety of techniques across the African countries.\n\nSome accounts supported a specific party or candidate, they said, while others backed multiple figures. In other cases, the pages appeared geared towards building support for Wagner activities or Russian deals for gold, diamonds and other natural resources.\n\nThe takedown on Wednesday was Facebook\u2019s second move against groups it linked to Prigozhin in a week. Last week the company said it had suspended a network of 50 Instagram accounts connected with the Internet Research Agency\n\nPrigozhin has denied US claims he finances the troll factory and says Wagner does not exist.", "description": "Fake networks in eight nations are connected to man allegedly behind disinformation empire", "authors": ["Luke Harding"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e97d76ab2bbdf53554fd0a0f27181e42468cdb7/0_22_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d25afadc059cbe79cbc7daa60242bdd", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
