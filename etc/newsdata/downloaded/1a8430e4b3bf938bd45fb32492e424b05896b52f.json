I don\u2019t have any side jobs or blogs for supplemental income, so everything\u2019s coming from my work and investments.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what his journey looks like in one chart:\n\nHow did he manage to do it?\n\nWell, for starters, he lived at home half of that time, a choice many millennials are making as housing costs skyrocket. Living rent-free allowed him to put big chunks of money away \u2014 up to a whopping 80% of his take-home, he said.\n\nNot having a spouse or kids didn\u2019t hurt either.\n\nFluffayPenguin says his taxable accounts consist of investments in the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund VTI, -0.10% , and other similar ETFs. He also puts a \u201ctiny percentage\u201d of his money in Fundrise, an online platform that lets you get into the real-estate game with a minimal initial investment\n\n\u201cSometimes, it feels like I\u2019m investing with the Wizard of Oz. My account keeps paying regular dividends (~10% my first year. Now down to 6-8% due to drop in housing prices),\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe company does give regular updates on what they invest, but nearly all of what they do is behind smoke and mirrors.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s dabbled directly in real estate, as well, having eventually owned two houses \u2014 not at the same time \u2014 over that decade.\n\nAs for his retirement accounts, FluffayPenguin says he has broad-market funds held in a Roth IRA, a traditional IRA and a 401(k).\n\n\u2018I\u2019m preparing for that drop, and it\u2019s fine. I\u2019d be happy if it drops double-digits since I\u2019ll just stick more money in.\u2019\n\nReaders cheered on his FIRE success story, though some pointed out reaching those numbers are unrealistic for those without the parental boost.\n\n\u201cThis absolutely proves success from early compounding, no student loans and living with parents for an extended period of time,\u201d one wrote. \u201cThere is a huge stigma with living at home, but when you can save >80%, it\u2019s a very attractive alternative lifestyle.\u201d\n\nOf course, this kind of run also wouldn\u2019t be possible without a surging market for home prices and a raging bull stock market, which, of course, won\u2019t last forever.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m preparing for that drop, and it\u2019s fine,\u201d FluffayPenguin countered. \u201cI\u2019d be happy if it drops double digits since I\u2019ll just stick more money in.\u201d\n\nNo double-digit drop on Tuesday, but both the Dow DJIA, +0.14% and the S&P SPX, -0.07% were trading lower at last check.", "description": "This millennial claims he was FIRE before FIRE became popular.", "authors": ["Shawn Langlois", "Social-Media Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP792_retire_MG_20190820123158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-20"}
