That is an absolute commitment.\u201d\n\nA government source said the report was a misrepresentation of the \u201cnon-paper\u201d, which discussed customs checks at place of origin or destination of goods.\n\nIn the limited cases that inspections were needed, physical checks could be at dedicated premises, factories or production sites, the source suggested.\n\nBut Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, dismissed the proposals as a \u201cnon-starter\u201d, and called for a \u201cserious proposal\u201d from the UK.\n\nSimon Coveney (@simoncoveney) Non-Paper = Non-Starter. Time the EU had a serious proposal from the UK Govt if a #Brexit deal is to be achievable in October. NI and IRE deserves better!\n\nSinn F\u00e9in in Ireland and the Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland also dismissed the plans on Monday night. Sinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald said they were \u201cabsolutely out of the question\u201d, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a mile, five miles or 10 miles away, the presence of physical checks will create economic and security challenges that are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nLabour said the proposals were \u201cutterly unworkable\u201d. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said: \u201cThey would place an enormous administrative burden on businesses and rely on technology that does not yet exist.\n\n\u201cCrucially, if true, they represent a rowing back on the commitments made to the people of Northern Ireland two years ago that there would be no return to a hard border or related checks or controls.\u201d\n\nThe leak comes as Johnson puts his finishing touches on formal written proposals expected to go to Brussels in the next week for a revised Brexit deal.\n\nAlthough all the indications are that a large gap remains in thinking, signs have emerged that the hardline position of the Conservative party\u2019s most Eurosceptic backbenchers has softened just days before Boris Johnson\u2019s team are due to enter a \u201ctunnel\u201d of secret negotiations with Brussels.\n\nMark Francois, the deputy chair of the European Research Group, has opened the door to a potential Brexit deal, indicating he would look at one even if it included a version of the controversial Irish border backstop to which the Eurosceptic ERG was once implacably opposed.\n\nDuring a heated and sometimes bad-tempered event on the party conference fringe, he indicated that the \u201cSpartan\u201d wing of the party was in the mood for a deal.\n\n\u201cIt has been sometimes been said that we will vote against anything regardless. That\u2019s not true,\u201d he said referring to the bloc of 28 backbenchers who voted against Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal three times.\n\n\u201cIf there is some form of deal, be it over the backstop or anything else, then I and my colleagues will look at it and read it very carefully, because at the end of the day you are talking about international treaty law. So I\u2019ll look at a deal if there is one,\u201d he said.\n\nFrancois\u2019 comments were seen as a subtle shift in approach for the ERG, whose support could unlock a deal for Johnson.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nAs recently as August, the de facto whip of the ERG warned that Johnson must honour his promise to kill off Theresa May\u2019s deal completely.\n\nJohnson has publicly said May\u2019s withdrawal agreement is dead but the formal proposals, due to go to the EU next week, are expected to revolve around a revised backstop for Northern Ireland involving an agreement for agri-food on the island of Ireland and a possible time limit on the other elements of the backstop.\n\n\u201cMy acid test will be: does it mean we genuinely leave the EU?\u201d Francois told a meeting organised by the Eurosceptic thinktank Bruges Group.\n\nHe said his support for a deal \u201crather depends what\u2019s in it \u2026 As a so-called Spartan, if it means we genuinely leave the EU, if it means we genuinely leave on Halloween, I will be the first in the aye lobby. If it really means we don\u2019t, then I will vote against it and if we don\u2019t no amount of browbeating will make me change my mind.\u201d\n\nHis remarks follow weeks of shifting mood over the Irish backstop. The Democratic Unionist party, which was implacably opposed to the backstop, has also indicated it was in the mood for a deal. It is understood that the DUP has been consulted on the plans that Johnson is to take to Brussels next week.\n\nIreland\u2019s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, also hinted last week that there could be amendments to the withdrawal agreement but warned there was still a huge gap between the UK and Irish positions.\n\nThe DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said she would look at the possibility of a backstop with a time limit but warned that agreeing to consider one was not the same as \u201cadvocating\u201d one.\n\nShe told the Bruges Group: \u201cIt would be good to get rid of the iniquitous backstop\u201d but added that it would be \u201cgood to get a deal\u201d.\n\nShe called for space to be given to negotiators, who now have fewer than 17 days to come up with a deal before the next EU summit.", "description": "RTE cites leaked proposals for clearance areas 5-10 miles from border and real-time tracking of goods", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89a739ca9a58522d51ee2dfcb0008a24c29d9e62/0_160_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=18dbb65d7d8aab71b41edef32a90c744", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
