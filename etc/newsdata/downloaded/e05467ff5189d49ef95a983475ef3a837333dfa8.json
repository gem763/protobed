What did our viewers gain from his vulgarity?\u201d\n\nVULGAR ROBERT DE NIRO CALLS TRUMP \u2018CRAZY,\u2019 DROPS PAIR OF F-BOMBS LIVE ON CNN\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s particularly puzzling that our show, which allegedly critiques media, would choose to host a Hollywood celebrity with zero discernible news value.\" \u2014 CNN on-air personality\n\nThe 76-year-old De Niro appeared on CNN\u2019s media show \u201cReliable Sources\u201d with host Brian Stelter, who told the Hollywood legend that the liberal network had been trying to book him \u201cfor a while.\u201d De Niro is famous for his tough-guy shtick and has used profanity to attack Trump in the past, including famously launching a salty tirade at the president during the 2018 Tony Awards.\n\nDuring his live CNN appearance, De Niro called the president \u201ccrazy\u201d and didn\u2019t disappoint fans of his iconic gangster flicks when he was asked about pundits on Fox News who support Trump.\n\n\u201cF--- \u2018em, f--- \u2018em,\u201d De Niro said.\n\nThe Hill media reporter Joe Concha feels the situation was \u201ccontrived\u201d because CNN has allowed profanity on its air in the past and De Niro is known for using vulgar language when speaking about President Trump. CNN has not distanced itself from the interview and even promoted it on social media and its website.\n\nA second CNN personality, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they would have quickly ended the interview when De Niro used profanity but admitted it was probably a win for the network because of the publicity it generated.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI would have said, \u2018We\u2019re done here,\u2019 but entitlement culture comes from people who are icons in their trade, they think they can get away with that on a Sunday morning,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s good for ratings you can deal with the blowback.\u201d\n\n\"If it\u2019s good for ratings you can deal with the blowback.\u201d \u2014 Second CNN personality\n\nStelter, unlike his colleague, did not immediately apologize for the language and noted that it was on cable so the comment wouldn\u2019t result in an FCC violation. \u201cBut it is still a Sunday morning,\u201d Stelter said. \u201cWhy do you choose to go that way?\u201d\n\nIronically, De Niro responded that Trump behaves \u201clike a gangster\u201d and said America is in a \u201cterrible\u201d situation as a result. After a commercial break, Stelter pivoted the conversation to De Niro\u2019s upcoming gangster movie, \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d but the duo inevitably turned their focus back to Trump.\n\nSTEPHANIE GRISHAM SAYS REPORTERS USED WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS TO \u2018GET FAMOUS\u2019\n\nDe Niro said that Trump \u201cmakes gangsters look bad\u201d because actual mobsters \u201ckeep their word.\u201d Stelter, who has been outspoken with his criticism of Trump himself, thanked De Niro for appearing and wrapped up the segment. He never commented further on the profanity.\n\nA CNN spokesperson directed Fox News to a Twitter exchange between Stelter and a National Republican Senatorial Committee staffer when asked why the partisan actor was booked on a media show.\n\n\u201cInterviewing one of the best-known actors in the world falls squarely within the purpose, which is (as I say most Sundays) to explore \u2018how the media world works, how the news gets made,\u2019\u201d Stelter tweeted when asked the purpose of his show in the first place.\n\nROBERT DE NIRO PLEADS TO MUELLER IN OPEN LETTER: 'THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO HEAR YOUR VOICE'\n\n\u201cSo his reliability as a reliable source on key issues like impeachment and the President\u2019s mental health is based solely on his status as a celebrity? Just wanted to make clear that was the calculus,\u201d NRSC staffer Matt Whitlock fired back at the \u201cReliable Sources\u201d host.\n\nNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that the CNN media show is \u201cas close to a sermon for the Resistance as one will get\u201d and De Niro's appearance was nothing different.\n\n\"Stelter feigned discomfort for what happened, but in reality, CNN couldn't be any prouder of how that went down. De Niro's tirade illustrated why any lecture from [CNN] about civility and decency will continue to ring hollow,\u201d Houck said. \u201cThe desire to impeach the president has become such an obsession for CNN and the rest of the liberal media that it's become a 21st-century version of the golden calf that these people worship.\u201d\n\nTRUMP SLAMS CNN\u2019S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: \u2018YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON\u2019\n\nDe Niro \u2013 who has played former Special Counsel Robert Mueller on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live \u2013 once urged Mueller to speak out against Trump in an open letter published by the New York Times. The Oscar-winning actor has also called Trump a \u201ctotal loser,\u201d a \u201cf---ing idiot,\u201d \u201cf---ing fool\u201d and said he would like to punch the president in the face.\n\n\u201cNo Things Considered\u201d host and political satirist Tim Young also questioned why the actor was booked on CNN\u2019s media show.\n\n\"I'm not sure how Robert De Niro is a \u2018reliable source,\u2019 or what he would even be a reliable source on. He didn\u2019t talk Hollywood, he was brought on to rant and swear about why he hates Trump,\u201d Young told Fox News before joking, \u201cOh, I get it, maybe he was a reliable source on Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\n\nDePauw University professor and frequent CNN critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News: \u201cWe live in a weird time in which pop culture blends with public affairs,\u201d but even with that consideration, there is no journalistic purpose to putting somebody like De Niro on \u201cwhat is supposed to be a serious\u201d show about media and public affairs.\n\n\u201cThe producers, including Stelter, just had to know that De Niro would go on television and cut loose with verbal brickbats and that's what they got,\" McCall said. \"Having Hollywood types on news programs to discuss national policy is a problem from the outset, but having an actor who has a history of strident and profane outbursts just further disrupts public dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe problem with this interview is not just the foul language, but also the angry and emotional tone that permeates the discussion,\u201d McCall continued. \u2018De Niro clearly detests Trump, which he has a right to do, but Stelter needed to guide the discussion into something that might generate meaningful insight\u2026 this interview was not good television or good journalism. It simply fuels public disenchantment with how the media does its job, allowing emotion and polarization into what needs to be rational dialogue.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMedia Research Center vice president Dan Gainor mocked the interview on Twitter, writing that \u201cReliable Sources\u201d is \u201cjust left-wing activism\u201d and noting that actual \u201cjournalists\u201d don\u2019t care what De Niro thinks of Trump.\n\nStelter responded, \u201cBut this journalist, no quote marks, does.\u201d\n\nNew York Post columnist Karol Markowicz summed up the feelings of many with her response to the CNN host, \u201cBut that's because you knew what he would say and that you agree with him. Where's the journalism in that? What did you discover?\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
