Thomas/Getty Images health care Family planning clinics watch their safety nets vanish Cutbacks have hit health clinics that lost federal dollars over Trump abortion rules.\n\nSome health clinics that quit the federal family planning program over Trump anti-abortion policies are cutting staff, charging for services that had been free and making other austerity moves to avert a major hollowing out of reproductive health care for poor women.\n\nAt least four state health departments, hundreds of Planned Parenthood clinics and dozens of independent providers have withdrawn from the more than $250 million Title X program. Some have literally had to box up and return unused supplies bought with a government discount. They\u2019re leaning on emergency funds, private donations and in some instances, state assistance.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough for the most hard-pressed providers. Trying to preserve as much patient access as they can, clinics are imposing new fees, trimming sex education and suspending some sexually transmitted disease testing even as the Trump White House makes eradicating HIV a national priority.\n\n\u201cWe're watching the safety net disintegrate right before our eyes,\u201d said Jessica Marcella, the vice president of advocacy and communications at the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, which represents staff at thousands of Title X clinics across all 50 states.\n\nThe clinics in August quit the Title X program, which dates back to the Richard Nixon presidency, when the Trump administration added restrictions that include forbidding clinics from referring patients for abortions. Another provision, requiring additional layers of physical and financial separation between abortion and other reproductive health services, takes effect in 2020.\n\nAnd the challenges to providing comprehensive reproductive and preventive care to poor women may become more severe. There could be a new wave of cuts when clinics burn through cash on hand. And while fundraising could forestall service rollbacks \u2014 and the administration insists new providers will step in to fill the void \u2014 the reality could be a permanent reduction in free or low-cost family planning services across the country.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

That\u2019s because the new rules allow discussions about abortion but forbid actually referring a patient to a provider \u2014 a restriction critics contend is a \u201cgag rule\u201d that tramples on patients\u2019 rights.\n\nThe extent of the service cuts is difficult to measure, because clinics only began exiting the program over the past two weeks. But disruptions are less likely in conservative-led states that have not been relying heavily on the more than 400 Planned Parenthood clinics that receive Title X funding. Meanwhile, the withdrawals by private and public grantees have left states including Maine, Oregon, Utah, Vermont and Washington with no Title X providers.\n\nTrump administration officials and anti-abortion groups portray the new rules as a de facto defunding of Planned Parenthood because the organization received up to $60 million per year from the Title X program. The organization was already barred from using that federal funding to provide abortions, but the new rule would require financial and physical separation of their abortion providers and other health care services funded by Title X. Critics of the women's health group say the policy change prevents federal funding from being used to subsidize abortion services.\n\nPlanned Parenthood, the American Medical Association and nearly two dozen states are fighting the new rules in a case that will go to the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in late September. But in the meantime, some clinics choosing to forego the Title X funding are figuring out how to make ends meet.\n\nThe Mahube-Otwa Community Action Partnership, which serves patients in rural Minnesota, is cutting half of its family planning staff of six and plans to curtail walk-in visits and initiatives like talking to college students about safe sex.\n\nThe Lovering Health Center in Greenland, N.H., is suspending its walk-in STI testing service, imposing a hiring freeze and stopping most community outreach and education work.\n\nThe Planned Parenthood affiliate in Cleveland has stopped using a mobile health care unit that brought STI testing and sex education services to underserved areas.\n\nAnd the Utah Navajo Health System is charging for once-free doctor visits, pregnancy and STI testing and other services that roughly $40,000 in Title X funds used to subsidize.\n\n\u201cWe're already seeing patients forego services,\u201d Byron Clarke, the chief operating officer of the UNHS, told POLITICO. \u201cIt hits hardest on people who are already considering whether they can afford the gas money to drive to see us.\u201d\n\nState health departments that left the program are pledging to make up for lost federal dollars with public funds. Planned Parenthood and other providers elsewhere are turning to fundraising, with varying degrees of success.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Illinois is relying on $3.5 million it raised since President Donald Trump was sworn in that it estimates will sustain services until June 30, 2020. The affiliate\u2019s president and CEO, Jennifer Welch, acknowledged that afterward \u201cthere may be a time when we have to increase our cost to our patients or decrease our services to our patients.\u201d\n\nSmaller clinics like Mahube-Otwa and Lovering Health Center also are adapting to another reality: losing their ability to buy contraceptives and other medications they bought at a discount while part of the Title X program.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of ability to fundraise,\u201d said Liz Kuoppala, Mahube-Otwa's executive director. \u201cWe don\u2019t have large foundations or a lot of wealth to tap into in the private sector.\u201d\n\nThe Lovering Health Center\u2019s executive director, Lisa Leach, said she'll emphasize the severity of the situation at her annual fundraising event in October.\n\n\"This year it\u2019s really a call to action,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for donors, for example, to fund five IUDs.\"\n\nProviders aiming to stay in the program submitted plans to HHS in August detailing how they plan to comply with the new rules. They have to show they're following through with those plans by Sept. 18., and must have separate physical facilities for abortion services in place by next March.\n\nBut some grantees say they\u2019re not entirely clear what HHS will consider as full compliance.\n\n\u201cI would not be shocked if they responded and said, \u2018Perfect!\u2019 and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they said, \u2018This is no good,\u201d said Marj Plumb, the acting executive director of the Family Planning Council of Nebraska, the state\u2019s sole manager of Title X funds.\n\nOther clinics and groups managing family planning dollars, such as Wisconsin\u2019s Department of Health Services and Unity Health Care in Washington, D.C., submitted plans to the department but are still assessing whether they can comply with the new policy.\n\nSan Francisco\u2019s Women\u2019s Community Clinic is also seeking more details and has said it's ready to give up $150,000 in annual Title X funding if it feels its principles are being compromised.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a gag rule, we\u2019ll pull out,\u201d CEO Vitka Eisen of the clinic\u2019s parent group HealthRIGHT 360 said.\n\nHHS officials have said they could find new providers to replace Planned Parenthood and other exiting groups \u201cwhere possible.\u201d But the department has declined to comment or respond to multiple questions about its search and how long that process might take.\n\nJonathan Imbody, vice president for government relations at the Christian Medical Association, which represents Christian health professionals, told POLITICO that he\u2019s confident there won\u2019t be gaps in care, even though Planned Parenthood and the other exiting providers served more than 1.5 million women in Title X.\n\n\u201cThey won't be missed,\u201d he said. \u201cAble and ready to serve Title X patients are thousands of federally qualified health centers and other nonprofit clinics across the country that provide much more comprehensive, compassionate care than does abortion-focused Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nBut in some parts of the country, replacements may be hard to find. Vermont, for example, relied exclusively on Planned Parenthood for Title X services, and state officials there said they're unaware of any potential replacement. Planned Parenthood was the only respondent each time Vermont\u2019s health department applied for Title X funding and put out a request for proposals, according to a department spokesperson.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, projects that remaining Title X clinics would have to see an average of 70 percent more patients seeking birth control to make up for Planned Parenthood\u2019s exit \u2014 a burden Guttmacher notes poses \u201cmassive challenges\u201d for many providers.\n\nOrganizations like the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association contend there's a finite pool of providers willing to be part of Title X and its sometimes burdensome bureaucratic requirements, and that most were already part of the program. Just a handful of new grantees were added earlier this year, including the faith-based California clinic network Obria, which opposes both abortion and most forms of contraception.\n\n\u201cThe notion there is this secondary network waiting in the wings to jump in doesn't bear out in reality,\u201d said Marcella of the family planning and reproductive health association.\n\nVictoria Colliver and Renuka Rayasam contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "Cutbacks have hit health clinics that lost federal dollars over Trump abortion rules.", "authors": ["Alice Miranda Ollstein", "Rachel Roubein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/56/71/094504394a228d6a79ee1ea0cfc5/190830-planned-parenthood-gty-773.jpg"}
