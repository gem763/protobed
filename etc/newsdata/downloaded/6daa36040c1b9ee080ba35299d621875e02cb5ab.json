No other US military members were injured.\n\nOfficials have not disclosed the total number killed in the firefight, but President Trump said the casualties outnumbered the captured\n\nWhile al-Baghdadi's death has deprived IS of its 'inspirational leader,' the security situation in Syria 'remains complex', Defense Secretary Esper told reporters.\n\nHe added that US troops were in position to retain control of key oil fields in northeast Syria.\n\nAmerican forces will remain positioned in the strategic area 'to deny ISIS access to those vital resources', and 'overwhelming military force' will be used against any group that threatens their safety, Esper added.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's death will not rid the world of terrorism or end Syria's ongoing conflict, but it sends 'a message to those who would question America's resolve', he said.\n\n'The United States, more than any other nation in the world, possesses the power, and the will, to hunt to the ends of the Earth those who wish to bring harm upon the American people.'", "description": "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley announced that two men had been taken prisoner and are being held at a secure location during a Monday briefing at the Pentagon.", "authors": ["Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/19/20294636-0-image-a-19_1572291726534.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
