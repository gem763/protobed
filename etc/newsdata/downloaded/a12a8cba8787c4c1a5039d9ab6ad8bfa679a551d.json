Going forward it\u2019s going to be very challenging as to what we do.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s got to move and if it can\u2019t move, what are we going to do? Dump it in the St. Lawrence? Ron Davidson, Soy Canada\u2019s executive director\n\nShipments of Canadian soybeans to China \u2013 the world\u2019s largest buyer of the oilseed \u2013 have remained negligible since December, when police arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on an extradition request from the United States. The plunge came after sales had surged 80 per cent in 2018 \u2013 when a Chinese tariff on U.S. beans left the Asian superpower to seek alternate markets such as Canada.\n\nShut out of China, American farmers were left holding a record one billion bushels of unsold beans \u2014 roughly three times the normal amount. That \u201clower price, aggressively marketed\u201d surplus soon made its way into the European Union \u2013 the second largest market globally \u2013 where it threatened Canada\u2019s foothold in 2018, said Ron Davidson, Soy Canada\u2019s executive director. And though sales to the EU have picked up somewhat this year, they remain below average levels. Meantime, excess U.S. beans are also pushing across the border into the Canadian market.\n\n\u201cNot having access to China is a big issue, being crowded out of the EU market is a big issue and having big imports coming into Canada is a big issue,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cAnd on top of all that, the weather. The combines are in the field. It\u2019s got to move and if it can\u2019t move, what are we going to do? Dump it in the St. Lawrence? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nChina is by far the largest consumer of soybeans, purchasing roughly 85 million tonnes of the 148 million tonnes of soybeans traded annually. The EU ranks as the second-largest market, purchasing 15 million tonnes each year.\n\nFinding alternate markets to fill the gaps left behind isn\u2019t easy, but that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t buyers out there, said Carsten Bredin, vice-president of grain merchandising for Richardson International, Canada\u2019s largest grain company.\n\n\u201cYou can sell those beans; it\u2019s just that farmers don\u2019t want to sell them at the current price,\u201d Bredin said. \u201cOur market is depressed no question. If you don\u2019t have China, which controls almost 60 per cent of the market, you\u2019re at a disadvantage. Canada is at the bottom of the price chain because of politics.\u201d\n\nI can deal with weather, I can deal with price uncertainty \u2026 but I can\u2019t compete with the U.S. Treasury Ernie Sirski, a Manitoba soybean farmer and board chair of Soy Canada\n\nSoybean prices fell from US$10.70 a bushel last year to US$7.80 in May \u2014 the lowest level since 2008 \u2014 before rebounding to a current US$9.33 a bushel on positive trade news. Indeed, China will buy US$20 billion of U.S. agricultural products in the first year if a Phase 1 trade deal is signed with the U.S., Bloomberg reported. Beijing also issued waivers for 10 million tonnes of soybean purchases this week.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean China will open the doors to Canadian farmers.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll be four or five years before China comes back to us,\u201d said Sirski of Soy Canada. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens in the meantime.\u201d\n\nA US$28 billion aid package from Washington has eased the pain of the trade wars for American farmers. For soybean farmers it has lifted the per-bushel price to roughly US$10.13, allowing them to sell at lower prices and frustrating producers north of the border, according to Soy Canada.\n\n\u201cI can deal with weather, I can deal with price uncertainty, I can do a lot to mitigate losses, but I can\u2019t compete with the U.S. Treasury, said Sirski, who farms 5,500 acres at his farm two hours north of Brandon, Man. Like other Canadian farmers, Sirski\u2019s soybeans came in late this year due to an unexpected snowfall and subsequent thaw that left sodden fields.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t turn a wheel for 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cBut soybeans can take a lot of abuse.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: npowell@nationalpost.com | Twitter: naomi_powell", "description": "Shut out of China, 60% of the market, and crowded out of other markets by the U.S., our farmers say there are few places to turn", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/soybeans-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
