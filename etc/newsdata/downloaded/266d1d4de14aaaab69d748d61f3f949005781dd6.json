Sidewalk is Amazon\u2019s new low-bandwidth network that uses the 900 megahertz spectrum, roughly the same spectrum range as LoRa. Given Sidewalk\u2019s characteristics, we are quite convinced that Sidewalk uses LoRa technology.\n\nOver the past several quarters, there has been some worry about LoRa\u2019s long-term growth rate. However, with Sidewalk, we believe that it takes LoRa to the next level, with significant proliferation and growth opportunities. Overall, with initial products expected to launch next year, we believe that Sidewalk can drive significant LoRa growth over the next several years. We reiterate our Overweight rating. We are increasing our price target to $55 from $50.\n\nIovance Biotherapeutics IOVA-Nasdaq\n\nBuy Price $18.79 on Sept. 25\n\nby H.C. Wainwright & Co.\n\nAn investor breakfast addressed the crucial relevance of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs [cells that the immune system uses to fight early-stage cancer]; [Iovance\u2019s] commercial prospects; and next steps.\n\nAlthough the company is not commercial- stage yet, we project that this should occur in 2021. As for pricing, management feels discussions are too early at this point; however, market research is ongoing, revisiting launch forecasts, timing, and pricing.\n\n[Iovance\u2019s anticancer technology using] TILs would probably fall in the same reimbursement bucket as CAR T [a rival treatment], and Novartis [NVS] has already done most of the work in prepping the market. Economically, TILs and CAR T could show the same pricing; however, the total cost is different, with TILs offering decreased overall costs mainly due to 1) lack of molecular engineering currently (for example, no viral vector component), and 2) lower hospitalization costs. Patients treated with TILs should leave the hospital sooner. Price target: $32.\n\nBoston Beer SA M-NYSE\n\nOutperform Price $349 on Sept. 25\n\nby BMO Capital Markets\n\nWe are upgrading Boston Beer to Outperform and raising our target price to $410. The company is one of the rare staples growth investments that doesn\u2019t require a sizable multiple expansion to \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nBoston\u2019s 2020 earnings per share could approach $13 (20% above the current consensus of $10.78) as Truly [hard seltzer] is primed to capture strong consumer demand and higher distribution/shelf space. Hard seltzer, in our base-case scenario, could post 80% growth in 2020 and a 30% [compound annual growth rate] over the next five years.\n\nThe main pushback against Boston\u2014its high price/earnings multiple (2020E: 33 times)\u2014can be turned on its head with a better assessment of Boston\u2019s earnings potential. In fact, we believe that 2020 EPS could approach $13 (even with sequentially lower seltzer/Truly growth), which implies that Boston is currently trading at an estimated 2020 P/E of 26 to 27 times, highly attractive, given its growth outlook.\n\nOur $410 target price is based on a 32 times P/E, unchanged from Boston Beer\u2019s current estimated 2020 multiple and still 750 basis points [7.5 percentage points] below its recent peak multiple.\n\nAnika Therapeutics ANIK-Nasdaq\n\nOutperform Price $52.92 on Sept. 24\n\nby Barrington Research\n\nAnika Therapeutics held an analyst and investor day last week near its headquarters in Boston. Management presented its long-term strategic vision and a five-year growth plan that are both quite compelling. Some highlights:\n\nAnika clearly believes that its historical expertise in utilizing hyaluronic acid, or HA, in osteoarthritis pain-management products, such as Orthovisc, Monovisc, and Cingal, is only just the beginning.\n\nAnika highlighted its early-stage efforts to build a franchise with the recent (soft) commercial launch of Tactoset, an HA-enhanced injectable bone-repair product for defects in the knee. In addition, the company discussed Hyalofast (a cartilage-repair product that is 60% enrolled in a Phase 3 trial) as well as earlier-stage research being done on a rotator-cuff-repair therapy product. Anika highlighted anterior-cruciate-ligament and biceps repair as potential new avenues to explore. Lastly, Anika looks to expand its HA platform into areas such as hip and extremities (wrist, hand, foot, additional tendons, and ligaments).\n\nOne of Anika\u2019s historical shortcomings has been long and disturbing gaps in new product introductions. Management stated that a key internal goal over the next five years is for new products to deliver at least 25% of overall revenue. We think the new management team \u201cgets it\u201d when it comes to the value creation that often stems from effective new product development.\n\nWe are maintaining our Outperform investment rating and increase our price target to $58 from $49.\n\nTo be considered for this section, material should be sent to Research@barrons.com.", "description": "Also, Wall Street analysts\u2019 views on Iovance Biotherapeutics, Boston Beer, and Anika Therapeutics", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-111486/social", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
