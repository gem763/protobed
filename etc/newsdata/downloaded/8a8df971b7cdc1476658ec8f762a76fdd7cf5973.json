Their sacrifice and courageous stand addressed the two-tier wages structure and permanent temporary worker classification that has plagued working class Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to once again thank our members\u2019 families and their local communities for their outpouring of support,\u201d added UAW President Gary Jones. \u201cOur members not only joined together in solidarity but felt the support of their whole community throughout this important stand.\u201d\n\nAbout 48,000 employees took to the picket line last month to demand higher hourly wages, lump-sum payments and a better profit-sharing plan. The strike shut down several plants and reportedly cost GM $2 billion since the strike started.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Sherrod Brown Sherrod Campbell BrownBooker: 'Democrats don't need more candidates to enter' The Hill's Morning Report - Presented by Better Medicare Alliance - Diplomat's 'powerful' testimony and 'lynching' attract headlines Hillary Clinton has said she'd consider 2020 race if she thought she could win: report MORE (Ohio), a vocal proponent of unions, praised the UAW and cited the new contract as a \u201ctestament to the value of the labor movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the UAW, GM could have increased workers\u2019 health care costs, kept their wages flat, and continued to use temporary workers indefinitely. More workers need union representation to help them stand up to corporate greed and fight for their rights and the rights of their fellow workers,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHowever, the contract will allow GM to permanently close three idled factories, including a large plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, this is another in a long line of sad days for the people in Lordstown. GM\u2019s unilateral decision this year to close Lordstown and their continued refusal to bring a new product to the plant is a betrayal of the Mahoning Valley. Lordstown auto workers are the best at what they do, and I will continue to stand with them, their families, and the entire community as we fight to bring good, UAW auto jobs to the Valley,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe UAW will now negotiate with Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler and seek similar terms.", "description": "General Motors (GM) has reached a deal with employees to end the longest automotive strike in 50 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gm-logo-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
