We want to live.\"\n\nAs staff at a McDonalds outlet closed up the premises, one of the parasols outside went up in flames.\n\nEven after the use of tear gas and water cannons, demonstrators continued to gather in the city streets.\n\nIn the capital Paris, some yellow vests joined a climate protest march.\n\nSeptember's protests have revived the yellow vest movement, though not to the levels seen late last year and in the first half of 2019.\n\nSaturday's protests came two days after the French government unveiled a draft 2020 budget with more than nine billion euros in tax cuts for households.\n\nIt includes five billion euros in tax cuts for some 12 million households already promised by President Emmanuel Macron, the result of a \"great national debate\" he held to try to address the ongoing protests.\n\nMacron swept to the presidency in 2017 with a pledge to get the country back on a solid financial footing. But he was caught short by the \"yellow vest\" movement which accused the former investment banker of ignoring the day-to-day struggles of many French.\n\nDemonstrations have been banned on the Champs-Elysees after protesters clashed with police on the famous Paris avenue on December 8 last year, in the early days of the yellow vest protests.\n\nOn that weekend, police detained 900 people: the most since the anti-government protests began.", "description": "French police repeatedly used tear gas and water cannons to break up a protest Saturday by nearly a 1,000 yellow vest demonstrators in the southwest city of Toulouse.
