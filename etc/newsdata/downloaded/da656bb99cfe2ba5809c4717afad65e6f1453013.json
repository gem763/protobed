Photo: Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMarianne Williamson was not pleased when prominent feminist writer Erica Jong and her daughter Molly Jong-Fast, a popular liberal commentator, both doubted Williamson\u2019s contention that prayer could change the course of Hurricane Dorian. So she messaged Jong to complain.\n\nThe contretemps began when Williamson, who has preached a New Agey message of love and spoken of President Trump\u2019s \u201cdark psychic energy\u201d during her extreme-long-shot bid for the presidency, tweeted on Wednesday that \u201cmillions of us seeing Dorian turn away from land is not a wacky idea; it is a creative use of the power of the mind.\u201d\n\nMarianne Williamson has deleted this tweet pic.twitter.com/YdLRD7UfoZ \u2014 Yashar Ali \ud83d\udc18 (@yashar) September 4, 2019\n\nHurricane Dorian has managed to stay just off shore of the Eastern Seaboard as it pounds multiple states with heavy rain on Thursday \u2014 but the storm devastated islands in the Bahamas earlier in the week, causing at least 20 deaths.\n\nWilliamson\u2019s message drew predictable ridicule from Twitter\u2019s chattering classes, to the point that she deleted it just minutes later. Some time later, Williamson messaged at least one of her critics privately.\n\nSo Marianne Williamson DMed my mom to complain about me and I have receipts. pic.twitter.com/V2iGO2Ny7H \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) September 5, 2019\n\n\u201cSorry to see you\u2019d call me \u2018weird,\u2019 Erica,\u201d Williamson writes, in part. (It is unclear when Jong did so.) \u201cI understand your daughter is young and doesn\u2019t know better but given your own career and the fact that we\u2019ve met, I would have thought you\u2019d at least be open to a non-corporate political voice in the mix.\u201d\n\nMolly Jong-Fast is 41 years old.\n\nThe screenshot Jong-Fast tweeted included a response from her mother to Williamson. \u201cI do believe in the need for love and empathy as you do!\u201d the Fear of Flying author writes. \u201cBut can we communicate to non-readers who are determined to pursue hatred?\u201d Williamson followed up with a lengthy rebuttal, but it did not appear to pacify Jong-Fast, who retweeted many messages critical of the candidate on Thursday.\n\nAfter deleting the original tweet linking prayer and hurricanes, Williamson defended her position on the matter in follow-up tweets on Wednesday.\n\nPrayer is a power of the mind, and it is neither bizarre nor unintelligent. People of faith belong in the Democratic Party, and will be necessary to the effort if we\u2019re to win in 2020. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nI was born and raised in Texas so I\u2019ve seen it. Millions of people today are praying that Dorian turn away from land, and treating those people with mockery or condescension because they believe it could help is part of how the overly secularized Left has lost lots of voters. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) September 4, 2019\n\nDespite indications to the contrary, Williamson\u2019s campaign insisted that she did not actually think thoughts could alter a hurricane\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cIt was a metaphor,\u201d spokeswoman Patricia Ewing said in a statement. \u201cWhen others speak of prayer and the mind it\u2019s considered profound, but Williamson is held to a different standard.\u201d", "description": "Marianne Williamson was not pleased when prominent feminist writer Erica Jong and her daughter, Molly Jong-Fast, both doubted Williamon\u2019s contention that prayer could change the course of Hurricane Dorian.
