Kenny Marchant Kenny Ewell MarchantEthics to investigate Guam delegate over alleged sexual relationship with staff member House Ethics Committee to investigate Katie Hill allegations Blood cancer patients deserve equal access to the cure MORE (R-Texas).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Candace's life experience and commitment to making education an equalizer for children in her community are only a few of the reasons why Candace will make a great colleague in Congress,\" said Rep. Tony C\u00e1rdenas (D-Calif.), chairman of Bold PAC, the CHC's campaign arm.\n\n\"As the only Latina running in a competitive open seat in Texas this cycle, Bold PAC is proud to endorse and support her campaign and will continue to help build a coalition around her race,\" he added.\n\nBold PAC commissioned a poll of primary voters in the district to determine the strength of Valenzuela's candidacy.\n\nAccording to the poll, 14 percent of baseline Democratic primary voters in the district favored Valenzuela, while 12 percent favored her nearest rival, Kim Olson, who was the Democratic nominee for Texas Agricultural Commissioner in 2018.\n\n\"[The candidates have] a lot of similarities in accomplishments, but because Candace is the only Latina, we think if she could consolidate that base that could give her a leg up,\" said Albert Morales, political director at Latino Decisions, the firm that conducted the poll.\n\nAttorney Crystal Fletcher came in third with 10 percent support, and Jan McDowell \u2014 the 2018 Democratic nominee for the seat \u2014 was picked by 9 percent of respondents.\n\nThe candidates are not yet well known, according to Morales, so Latino Decisions provided respondents with biographical data on Valenzuela.\n\nRespondents who heard Valenzuela's biography were more likely to support her; 29 percent of those respondents said they supported Valenzuela, while 8 percent supported Olson.\n\nThe Hill obtained a memo from Latino Decisions to C\u00e1rdenas recommending Valenzuela run on her personal history and focus on issues like health care.\n\n\"Our respondents reacted positively to specific points from Valenzuela\u2019s biography, namely those that emphasized overcoming her early hardships,\" reads the Latino Decisions memo.\n\nValenzuela is among the few Hispanic primary candidates to stand out in competitive districts nationwide ahead of 2020.\n\n\"If you're looking for Latinos or Latinas running for Congress in competitive races it's slim pickings,\" Morales told The Hill.\n\nAfter two straight elections of aggressive expansion, Bold PAC is pivoting toward defending the CHC's 37 incumbents, and will likely look to support Latinos in retiring Democratic Rep.

Katie Hill resigns amid ethics probe Trump accuser E. Jean Carroll raises double standard over president, Rep. Hill MORE (D-Calif.) last weekend.\n\nIn the last two cycles, Bold PAC has also expanded its network of support among non-CHC Democratic candidates.\n\nBut despite what looks to be a wide-open House race in Texas \u2014 in part thanks to higher Hispanic voter participation \u2014 Valenzuela is so far the lone Latina newcomer running in the Lone Star State.\n\n\"When we talk about Latino turnout in Texas, it is not enough to say we plan on engaging Latino voters. We also have to be committed to putting people on the ballot that reflect and understand our communities as well,\" said C\u00e1rdenas.\n\nTexas's 24th congressional district is an example of shifting political attitudes in the state.\n\nMarchant, one of six retiring House Republicans from Texas, has represented the suburban Dallas-area district since 2004.\n\nMarchant's 2018 showing was the weakest of his political career, beating Democratic nominee McDowell by a little more than 3 points.\n\nThe 24th district, ranked by the Cook Political Report as an R+9 but a toss-up for 2020, is 25 percent Hispanic, according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.\n\nDemocrats see an opportunity to pick up a number of House seats in Texas in 2020 as they did in California in 2018, particularly as Hispanic voters are driven to higher participation.\n\n\"The reason Texas is this year's California for the [Democrats] is because you have a handful of these districts that came close last cycle without fielding strong candidates,\" said Morales.", "description": "The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) campaign arm is\u00a0all-in in\u00a0its backing of\u00a0a Texas Latina Democrat running in a crowded Dallas-area House primary, as few top-tier Hispanic candidates have so far made an\u00a0impression in 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cardenastony_021319gn_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
