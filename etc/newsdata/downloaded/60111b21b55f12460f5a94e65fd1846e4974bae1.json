Defending President Trump from the impeachment inquiry has become an exercise in escalating absurdity. Party loyalty forces Republicans to betray some of their most deeply held beliefs by making hypocritical excuses for the soaring deficit and Trump\u2019s abandonment of US strategic interests in the Middle East. And many Republicans seem to prefer stupid political stunts (like the invasion of a secure room in the Capitol where impeachment hearings were being held) to the hard work of policymaking.\n\nThat\u2019s why it made headlines when A Wayne Johnson, a former senior official in Trump\u2019s education department, recently announced a plan to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars of federal student loan debt. Johnson is a long-shot candidate seeking appointment to a soon-to-be-vacant US Senate seat, and his plan is unlikely to be enacted anytime soon. But it is rare indeed to see a Republican official seeming to side with left-leaning Democratic presidential candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren (who have both proposed major debt-forgiveness plans) against his former boss, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos (who has called such proposals \u201ccrazy\u201d). What does it all mean?\n\nStudent loan debt is a metastasizing national problem and political issue (as this Guardian Q&A helpfully explains). Some 45 million Americans have student loans, and student debt has doubled over the past decade. The overall national student debt is $1.6tn, which is expected to balloon further to $2tn by 2022. Nearly a fifth of borrowers who are not presently enrolled in school are at least 90 days delinquent in their payments. Student loan debt exceeds both credit card debts and auto loans, and appears to be damaging the economy by causing young people to put off marriage, childbirth, home ownership and small business formation.\n\nJohnson, who oversaw the Office of Federal Student Aid in the Trump administration, points to repayment trends that suggest much of the student loan debt will never be repaid. The debt burden, he says, \u201crides on [debtors\u2019] credit files \u2013 it rides on their backs \u2013 for decades. The time has come for us to end and stop the insanity.\n\n\u201cIf this was a medical problem,\u201d he adds, \u201cit would be a pandemic, and the whole country would be figuring out how to inoculate against it.\u201d The system, he concludes, is \u201cfundamentally broken\u201d.\n\nJohnson proposes to cancel up to $50,000 in loan debt for each student and to provide up to $50,000 in tax credits for those who have already paid off their student loans. He calculates that his plan would cost $925bn \u2013 more than Warren\u2019s plan, though less than Sanders\u2019 \u2013 and would be paid for with a 1% tax on revenue generated by all employers.\n\n\u201cI do respect Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for bringing the nature of the discussion forward,\u201d Johnson says. But he does not support the Democratic candidates\u2019 plans to end tuition and fees at public colleges and universities, which he claims would amount to a \u201cgovernment takeover of post-high school education\u201d. However, since under Johnson\u2019s plan students would continue to borrow, there presumably would need to be another round of debt forgiveness in the future. Johnson also proposes to end the federal government\u2019s provision of student loans, instead offering a $50,000 grant that students could use to enroll in colleges or vocational schools, with the remainder of loan-financing to be shifted to private lenders.\n\nRepublicans have become increasingly suspicious of higher education; at the beginning of this decade, 58% believed that colleges and universities had a positive impact on the course of the country, only 33% say the same now. Nonetheless, most Republicans also acknowledge that a college degree has become important (or even essential) for helping young people succeed in today\u2019s economy. Johnson feels that members of his party would support a tax increase to pay for his plan since Republicans \u201cunderstand the concept of investment, and particularly an investment in human capital\u201d. A college education, he adds, \u201cis valuable to our citizens and it\u2019s valuable to employers \u2013 but right now, only the students pay. Employers say they need a better-trained workforce. My plan sets forth an easy way to achieve that important goal.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan for student loan cancellation, like those of Warren and Sanders, is vulnerable to criticism that it\u2019s a regressive policy, since it would disproportionately benefit students who take out loans to obtain graduate credentials (such as a law or medical degree) and eventually will become rich enough not to need debt relief. His $50,000 grant proposal also would be insufficient to pay for many advanced degree problems, and wouldn\u2019t do much to address the rising cost and uncertain quality of many programs.\n\nNonetheless, the significance of Johnson\u2019s student loan forgiveness proposal lies not in its details but in its very existence as a Republican response to the problem of rising indebtedness. Johnson\u2019s proposal may help move the concept of debt-forgiveness into the political mainstream and encourage bipartisan efforts to address it.\n\nIf that were to happen, it would be a small sign of a return to normalcy in government, of the sort that prevailed before the present era of ideologically driven partisanship and Trumpian tribalism. Even today, there are many Republican members of Congress who ran for office out of a sincere conviction that both parties care about many of the same issues but offer different ways of solving common problems. That doesn\u2019t describe the present political reality, but it\u2019s a critically important aspiration. The country desperately needs to return to a system in which our two parties offer serious policies, debate the alternatives rationally, and engage in compromise to find common ground. The growing urgency of the student debt crisis may offer a way back.", "description": "A Republican official who resigned from Trump\u2019s education department is calling for massive student debt forgiveness \u2013 echoing Sanders and Warren", "authors": ["Geoffrey Kabaservice"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fd9434c00e0b590ac102342afef65b8e4840f86/0_91_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=2b503f419081c8b3de21a2c9cc116445", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
