Photo: Getty Images\n\nI\u2019ve long believed that a carelessly crafted guest list can ruin a wedding, which is why I have my concerns about fashion designer Misha Nonoo and entrepreneur Michael Hess\u2019s upcoming ceremony in Rome on Friday. Some people who have already landed in the Eternal City, like Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, are sure to be A-plus attendees. But some unconfirmed guests have me worried: notably, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.\n\nIt makes sense that Meghan would be present at Nonoo\u2019s wedding; the two have been close for quite a few years, and it\u2019s suspected that Nonoo had a hand in introducing Meghan to her royal beau. But it would be slightly more surprising if Nonoo and Hess invited Ivanka, as was reported by Hello! magazine. Per a cursory Google search, the affianced don\u2019t appear to be tight friends with Javanka; however, Jared\u2019s brother Joshua, who is expected to attend the wedding with Karlie Kloss, has been pals with Hess since their Harvard days.\n\nIf Ivanka does show up, I imagine that\u2019ll be a little awkward for the Duchess of Sussex. Though Meghan interviewed Ivanka in 2014 for her now-permanently defunct blog The Tig and described the First Daughter as \u201csavvy\u201d and \u201cintelligent,\u201d they haven\u2019t exactly been close since. Remember when Ivanka publicly congratulated the royals on their engagement and then didn\u2019t get an invite to the wedding? Or that time Ivanka\u2019s father called Meghan \u201cnasty\u201d? Wow \u2026 memories.\n\nOne can only hope that Hello! got the guest list wrong and that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex won\u2019t be forced to do the Cha Cha Slide alongside Javanka. But Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, who are also rumored to be on the list, better be at the wedding \u2014 we\u2019re looking forward to the chaotic energy they\u2019ll bring.\n\nStay in touch.
