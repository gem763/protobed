Also worrisome: The injuries occurred to their right arms, the ones they use to make their millions - and help their teams compete for titles. What will be the prognosis beyond this season for Roethlisberger, and for later in the schedule for Brees, who is expected to return in a couple of months.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say neither New Orleans nor Pittsburgh is much of a Super Bowl threat without its veteran quarterback, each having taken its team to an NFL title. Sure, Mason Rudolph looked solid enough, throwing for two fourth-quarter touchdowns in the Steelers\u2019 28-26 loss to Seattle. And Teddy Bridgewater, though he struggled against the Rams\u2019 strong defense Sunday in a 27-9 loss, is considered by many the best insurance policy at quarterback in the NFL.\n\nStill, we\u2019re talking about two likely Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees five years after each retires. While Brees is 40 and Roethlisberger is 37, neither has talked about hanging it up. Perhaps they\u2019re inspired by the 92-year-old, uh, 42-year-old Tom Brady in New England.\n\nBrees was not able to grip the football, an impossible situation for a quarterback, particularly one with the Midas touch that Brees owns. New Orleans (1-1) is fortunate the NFC South is not looking particularly imposing, and barring a major surgery, the 19-year veteran figures to be back behind center in 2019.\n\nRams quarterback Jared Goff sure hopes so.\n\n\u201cI told him I\u2019m hoping for the best,\u201d Goff said of his postgame chat with Brees. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player for this league, a face of the league, and somebody we need in the league.\u201d\n\nBrees\u2019 career was in doubt in 2006 after shoulder surgery made teams wary of signing the free agent who had lost his job in San Diego to Philip Rivers. Miami wasn\u2019t sold he could be effective again, and the Saints couldn\u2019t be certain, either. But they took the gamble, which led to the franchise\u2019s best string of seasons, including the 2009 NFL championship.\n\nThe Dolphins are still searching for their franchise QB.\n\nBridgewater also had his career disrupted by injury, a nasty knee issue while Minnesota\u2019s starter that cost him the 2016 season and pretty much relegated him to backup status since. Coach Sean Payton\u2019s offense rarely has been run by anyone but Brees, so it\u2019s hard to predict how Bridgewater might fare. We\u2019re about to find out.\n\nAs for Rudolph, he beat out Joshua Dobbs for the backup role to Big Ben, whose durability isn\u2019t quite like that of Brees or Brady - or his fellow first-round draft picks in 2004, Eli Manning and Philip Rivers. But it\u2019s impressive: Roethlisberger has started 215 games, and has not missed a significant portion of a regular season since 2015, and before that in 2010, when he still guided Pittsburgh to the Super Bowl.\n\nRudolph might be the future quarterback for the Steelers, and for the rest of 2019 he is the present QB. With the Steelers (0-2) already in a hole in an AFC North led by Baltimore, losing Roethlisberger is ominous.\n\nIt also means that the three key components of their high-octane offense of recent seasons - Roethlisberger, Le\u2019Veon Bell and Antonio Brown - aren\u2019t around.\n\nOf the two teams, the Saints appear in far better position than the Steelers. Regardless, this is a major blow in the Big Easy and Steel City.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Few scenes Sunday seemed more incongruous than Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger on the sideline watching their teams trying to score without them.
