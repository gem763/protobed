Never Trumpers insist they won\u2019t back Warren", "language": "en", "text": "But in interviews with Never Trump Republicans over the past month, there has been a palpable resistance to Warren, even if, as the Democratic nominee, she offers the most realistic path to defeating the president. Indeed, watching the senator catch or surpass Biden in some public opinion polls has left many of the president\u2019s GOP opponents feeling despondent and disenfranchised.\n\nThese Never Trump Republicans argue that a Trump-Warren matchup offers equally bad choices, albeit for different reasons. They complain about the senator\u2019s liberalism, which offends their conservative sensibilities and counters everything they have worked for professionally. They also complain about Warren\u2019s populism, which strikes them as similar to the president\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI find certain things about Elizabeth Warren to be reminiscent of Trump, frankly,\u201d said Mona Charen, a conservative columnist and outspoken Trump critic. \u201cI\u2019m very eager to see Trump gone. He\u2019s so destructive to the country and all the things I hold dear \u2014 and conservative values. But unfortunately, the Democratic Party seems to have a death wish.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["David Drucker", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Campaigns Maybe-Not-Trump-Never-Trumpers-Insist-They-Wont-Back-Warren"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
