But the whole point of having a government internal audit service looking at this is to make sure that we take it seriously.\u201d\n\nShe said the review would look at how many Hacker House employees were genuinely based in the UK.\n\nFarrelly pointed out that the company\u2019s LinkedIn page appeared to list a bogus UK-based employee under the name \u201cAnnie T\u201d, whose profile picture was illustrated with a stock image downloaded from Pinterest. He handed Morgan a copy of the page. \u201cWe will look at it with interest,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nFarrelly said: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t just seem to be technical breaches of the Companies Act or DCMS bidding criteria, but actually obtaining money by deception.\u201d\n\nHe asked Morgan whether she planned to refer the matter to the police if the review found \u201cfalse representations\u201d had been made. Morgan said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge the review.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to the committee, Morgan denied that Boris Johnson had any link to the awarding of the grant, which was made from the cyberskills immediate impact fund (CSIIF). She said: \u201cAny notion of the prime minister influencing \u2013 whether directly or indirectly \u2013 any aspect of the due diligence, assessment and award of any grant funding made through the CSIIF is simply not true.\u201d\n\nMorgan said she had not seen Arcuri\u2019s application for the grant but said she doubted whether Arcuri had mentioned the prime minister\u2019s name in it. She agreed to publish the application after the completion of the review, which is expected at the end of October.\n\nShe pointed out that as part of the grant, Hacker House had a target to help 50 UK residents gain employment in cybersecurity roles. Since the money was awarded in February it had helped 11 UK residents to gain such places.\n\nArcuri says the grant was obtained on merit and has denied any wrongdoing. She told ITV: \u201cMy company is based in the UK. And it\u2019s never not been in the UK. Never.\u201d\n\nShe said DCMS approached Hacker House before awarding the grant. \u201cThey came to us and said: \u2018Hey, we have this pot of money.\u2019 And I said: \u2018Wow, you have a pot of money to do exactly as we are doing with the technology we were building. Why wouldn\u2019t you fund us?\u2019\u201d", "description": "MPs say matter should be referred to police if DCMS review finds possible fraud", "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc5739a890bd26c0bafdc7c56616e108cc6eafe3/83_286_1796_1077/master/1796.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=dc221b4ad6959cca7b45bda2f84adeaf", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
