Get a better candidate this time, you\u2019ll need it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019 Report\n\nMr Trump said Mrs Pelosi should focus on her own city, San Francisco, which he described as a \"tent city\" of homeless people.\n\nWhat's the inquiry about?\n\nThe impeachment inquiry - which may seek to remove Mr Trump from office - stems from the whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nIn the call, Mr Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm. No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has come to light.\n\nDemocrats have pointed out the call with the newly elected Mr Zelensky took place at the same time Mr Trump decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine.\n\nMr Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable US ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit.\n\nWhat did Democrats say?\n\nDemocrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week.\n\nHouse oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo: \"I do not take this step lightly.\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees.\"\n\nThe subpoena will request documents on Mr Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the impeachment inquiry\n\nMrs Pelosi and Mr Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings.\n\n\"We're not fooling around here,\" Mr Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to \"drag on\".\n\nHe also criticised the president's comments against the whistleblower as \"a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses\" and \"an incitement of violence\".\n\nMr Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr Trump claimed.\n\nQuick facts on impeachment\n\nImpeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office\n\nIf the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial\n\nA Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber\n\nOnly two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed\n\nPresident Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached", "description": "The president steps up his attacks on Democrats as proceedings against him gather pace in Congress.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07py78p.jpg"}
