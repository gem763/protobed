The store generated more than $50 billion in sales last year, and the company said two-thirds of app downloads started with a search.\n\nBut as Apple has become one of the largest competitors on a platform that it controls, suspicions that the company has been tipping the scales in its own favor are at the heart of antitrust complaints in the United States, Europe and Russia.\n\nApple\u2019s apps have ranked first recently for at least 700 search terms in the store, according to a New York Times analysis of six years of search results compiled by Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Some searches produced as many as 14 Apple apps before showing results from rivals, the analysis showed. (Though competitors could pay Apple to place ads above the Apple results.)\n\nPresented with the results of the analysis, two senior Apple executives acknowledged in a recent interview that, for more than a year, the top results of many common searches in the iPhone App Store were packed with the company\u2019s own apps. That was the case even when the Apple apps were less relevant and less popular than ones from its competitors. The executives said the company had since adjusted the algorithm so that fewer of its own apps appeared at the top of search results.\n\nThe Times\u2019s analysis of App Store data \u2014 which included rankings of more than 1,800 specific apps across 13 keywords since 2013 \u2014 illustrated the influence as well as the opacity of the algorithms that underpin tech companies\u2019 platforms.\n\nThose algorithms can help decide which apps are installed, which articles are read and which products are bought. But Apple and other tech giants like Facebook and Google will not explain in detail how such algorithms work \u2014 even when they blame the algorithm for problems.\n\nPhilip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the App Store, and Eddy Cue, the senior vice president who oversees many of the Apple apps that benefited from the results, said there was nothing underhanded about the algorithm the company had built to display search results in the store.\n\nThe executives said the company did not manually alter search results to benefit itself. Instead, they said, Apple apps generally rank higher than competitors because of their popularity and because their generic names are often a close match to broad search terms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about the way we run search in the App Store that\u2019s designed or intended to drive Apple\u2019s downloads of our own apps,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cWe\u2019ll present results based on what we think the user wants.\u201d\n\nApple added its apps to the App Store in June 2016. Since then, it has been the top result for many popular search terms, according to the Sensor Tower data. Those Apple apps held on for years while top rivals remained stuck below, sometimes hundreds of spots down the list, the data shows.\n\nResults in #1 5 10 Before Apple Music arrived in the App Store, Spotify was for years the first result in searches for \u201cmusic.\u201d Shortly after Apple Music was released in June 2016, it took the top spot. By then, Spotify had fallen to fourth place. In Feb. 2018, Apple apps suddenly appeared in the top six results for \u201cmusic\u201d By the end of 2018, there were eight, some of which were unrelated to music. At this point, Spotify was the 23rd result. Spotify complained to European regulators in March that Apple was abusing its role as the gatekeeper of the App Store. By April, all but two of Apple\u2019s apps disappeared from the top results for \u201cmusic.\u201d Source: Sensor Tower\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the company could not verify the data because it did not keep a record of historical search results.\n\nThe company is facing the most direct legal challenge in the United States to the clout it has built up through its App Store. In May, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to allow an antitrust class action against Apple to move forward, saying consumers should be allowed to try to prove that the technology giant had used monopoly power to raise the prices of iPhone apps.\n\nWhen multiple Apple apps packed the search results, such as in searches for \u201cmusic,\u201d the Apple executives attributed the results to a feature of the App Store search engine that sometimes grouped apps by maker. They tweaked that feature in July so Apple apps would no longer look as if they were receiving special treatment. Many Apple apps dropped as a result.\n\nStill, the executives denied that there had been a problem that needed fixing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not corrected,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s improved,\u201d said Mr. Cue.\n\nSeveral consultants who study the App Store algorithm to help companies rank higher said Apple\u2019s consistent success in the marketplace was suspicious. Algorithms are automated systems designed to largely run on their own. But it is humans who decide what algorithms measure. And those decisions can be subjective.\n\n\u201cI find it hard to believe that organically there are certain Apple apps that rank better than higher-reviewed, more downloaded competitors,\u201d said Todd Dunham, chief executive of the ASO Project, which consults app makers on how to rank higher in the results.\n\nSome of the search results found in The Times\u2019s analysis appeared \u201csteered,\u201d said Eric Enge, head of another such firm, Stone Temple Consulting. \u201cIt\u2019s no question that the app universe is one of the major battlegrounds out there, and there\u2019s just a ton to be gained commercially by dominating,\u201d he said.\n\nThe average number of Apple apps at the top of search results by month \u201cmusic\u201d #1 5 10 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201ctv\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cvideo\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cmaps\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 The average number of Apple apps at the top of search results by month \u201cmusic\u201d #1 5 10 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201ctv\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cvideo\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cmaps\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 The average number of Apple apps at the top of search results by month \u201cmusic\u201d #1 5 10 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201ctv\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cvideo\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cmaps\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 The average number of Apple apps at the top of search results by month \u201cmusic\u201d #1 5 10 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201ctv\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cvideo\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 \u201cmaps\u201d #1 5 Apr. \u201818 July \u201818 Oct. \u201818 Jan. \u201819 Apr. \u201819 July \u201819 Source: Sensor Tower\n\nThe search algorithm in the App Store was built by a small team of engineers in Cupertino, Calif., some of whom said in a separate interview arranged by Apple that they hadn\u2019t noticed for months that Apple was dominating search results for music and other categories.\n\nOnce they did notice, they said, a single engineer decided to change the algorithm.\n\nThe engineers said they had to be vague when talking about how their algorithm worked, to avoid revealing too much to fraudsters looking to game it. The algorithm examines 42 different signals, they said, including an app\u2019s relevance to a given search, its ratings, and its popularity based on downloads and user clicks.\n\nApple introduced the App Store in 2008, and it quickly revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for people to download games, tools for work and social-networking services. More than two million apps are available on the App Store.\n\nApple\u2019s tight control of its App Store has led to a marketplace that appears to be less susceptible to fraud than the Play Store, the app marketplace on Android smartphones that is run by Google. Google\u2019s Play Store results are partly personalized, so each person might see a different set of results.\n\nCompanies like Facebook, Spotify and Yelp have thrived on Apple\u2019s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google\u2019s Play Store.\n\nTo get their apps discovered, companies try to push them up the ranks in the App Store\u2019s search results. There is an industry of consultants who charge for their expertise on setting the right title, description and other details to please the App Store algorithm.\n\nBut Apple\u2019s algorithm also appears to have been a boon for its own apps.\n\nOn Aug. 21, Apple apps ranked first in 735 of roughly 60,000 search terms tracked by Sensor Tower. Most of the tracked searches were obscure, but Apple\u2019s apps ranked first for many of the popular queries. For instance, for most of June and July, Apple apps were the top result for these search terms: books, music, news, magazines, podcasts, video, TV, movies, sports, card, gift, money, credit, debit, fitness, people, friends, time, notes, docs, files, cloud, storage, message, home, store, mail, maps, traffic, stocks and weather.\n\nAlgorithm change \u2014 1.2% Share of keywords for which Apple apps have ranked first 1.0 0.8 iOS 12 0.6 iOS 11 0.4 iOS 10 beta released to developers 0.2 2017 2018 2019 1.2% 1.0 Share of keywords for which Apple apps have ranked first 0.8 iOS 12 0.6 iOS 11 iOS 10 beta released to developers 0.4 Algorithm change \u2014 0.2 2017 2018 2019 1.2% 1.0 Share of keywords for which Apple apps have ranked first 0.8 iOS 12 0.6 iOS 11 iOS 10 beta released to developers 0.4 Algorithm change \u2014 0.2 2017 2018 2019 1.2% 1.0 Share of keywords for which Apple apps have ranked first 0.8 iOS 12 0.6 iOS 11 iOS 10 beta released to developers 0.4 Algorithm change \u2014 0.2 2017 2018 2019 Weekly median. The number of keywords surveyed every day ranged from 10,000 to 60,000. | Source: Sensor Tower\n\nThe Wall Street Journal also found that Apple apps regularly ranked first for many searches in an analysis of 600 searches over two days in June.\n\nApple succeeded in some of the App Store\u2019s most hotly contested search results. At least four Apple apps led the results for \u201cTV\u201d from at least June 2018 to last month. Netflix has been stuck mostly in the hundreds.\n\nIn searches for \u201cmusic,\u201d Spotify was for years the first result, but the Apple Music app took the top spot shortly after it was released in June 2016. By the end of 2018, the top eight results were Apple apps, some unrelated to music.\n\nIf you searched for \u201cpodcast\u201d in May 2018, you would have had to scroll through as many as 14 Apple apps before finding one made by another publisher.\n\nWhile the Apple Podcasts app has held the No. 1 spot for \u201cpodcast\u201d searches since June 2016, other popular podcast apps have struggled in the rankings. A competitor named Stitcher, for instance, has been stuck in the hundreds of podcast search results since June 2018.\n\nThat has taken a toll on Stitcher\u2019s business. Amy Fitzgibbons, Stitcher\u2019s marketing chief, said people searching \u201cpodcast\u201d accounted for the majority of Stitcher\u2019s downloads on Google\u2019s rival Play Store. \u201cIn the Apple App Store, \u2018podcast\u2019 did not even rank as a source of downloads for us,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Times analysis uncovered other surprising examples of Apple apps\u2019 success. On March 25, the company unveiled an Apple-branded credit card that can be used via the Apple Wallet app. The next day, Apple Wallet was the No. 1 result in searches for \u201cmoney,\u201d \u201ccredit\u201d and \u201cdebit.\u201d The app had not ranked for those search terms before then.\n\nMr. Cue and other Apple executives speculated that the team marketing the Apple Wallet app had added \u201cmoney,\u201d \u201ccredit\u201d and \u201cdebit\u201d to the underlying description of the app, causing it to appear for those search results.\n\nThen people searched those terms, found the Apple Wallet app and clicked on it, telling the algorithm that it should be the first result.\n\n\u201cWe can just tell you that we\u2019ve not done anything to drive that \u2014 that is, other than launching a great wallet, an Apple Card and marketing the heck out of it,\u201d Mr. Schiller said.\n\nWhen search results were flooded with Apple apps, Apple executives said, the algorithm concluded that people were looking for a specific Apple app and decided to surface other apps by the same developer.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t always to Apple\u2019s benefit. For instance, they said, searching \u201coffice\u201d returns a series of Microsoft apps because the algorithm recognizes they are looking for Microsoft Office tools.\n\nApple engineers said the algorithm believed people searching \u201cmusic\u201d wanted just Apple Music because users clicked on the Apple Music app so frequently. Apple Music had a distinct advantage over other apps: It comes preinstalled on iPhones. Apple said some people used the search engine to find apps that were already on their phones.\n\nWhen people search \u201cmusic,\u201d the App Store reminds them that they already have Apple Music installed. Many people then click on the app, the engineers said, adding to its popularity in the eyes of the algorithm.\n\nOver the past several months, Apple engineers said, they began noticing how the algorithm was packing results with Apple apps. First, they stopped the algorithm from doing that for certain searches. In July, they turned it off for all Apple apps.\n\nOn July 12, many Apple apps dropped sharply in the rankings of popular searches. The top results for \u201cTV\u201d went from four Apple apps to two. \u201cVideo\u201d and \u201cmaps\u201d changed from three top Apple apps to one. And Apple Wallet dropped from the No. 1 spot for \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201ccredit.\u201d\n\nMr. Schiller and Mr. Cue said the algorithm had been working properly. They simply decided to handicap themselves to help other developers.\n\n\u201cWe make mistakes all the time,\u201d Mr. Cue said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to admit when we do,\u201d Mr. Schiller said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a mistake.\u201d", "description": "A New York Times analysis of six years of search results found Apple dominated the top results for many popular search terms.", "authors": ["Jack Nicas", "Keith Collins"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/technology/appstore-still-promo/apple-app-store-competition-promo-1567208756488-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
