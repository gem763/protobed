I can't confirm or deny,' Millsy wrote in the message.\n\nAsh joked that Millsy confirmed he's the wolf, writing: 'Translated: Confirmed.'\n\nHunting for answers! Ash took to Instagram on Thursday to share a video of himself where he walked up to a bus stop that had a poster for the show on it\n\nHe's sure!

So that's a fact,' Millsy said.\n\nDenial: Earlier in the week meanwhile, Millsy denied rumours that he's appearing on the hit show\n\nUnconvinced, A.B asked Millsy to prove his innocence by singing the same song the Wolf performed on the show.\n\n'So if we asked you to sing Man I Feel Like A Woman right now that would be weird?' she cheekily asked.\n\nAfter a brief pause, Millsy responded: 'I don't know the words!'\n\nIt comes weeks after a producer at Fox FM's Fifi, Fev & Byron show tweeted a snap of himself with the wolf, while tagging Millsy.\n\nOver the four episodes of The Masked Singer Australia, there have been clues that have linked the wolf to the actor.\n\n'Am I the wolf? Well, I have that reputation. Maybe that's why I'm up all night,' a clue read, which likely refers to his 2004 album titled Up All Night.\n\nIs that a clue?
