Like, 'Oh, my girl needs to be like the other girls, showing her body off'.\n\n\"I didn't realise that that was affecting my soul and my spirit as someone that's married and loved, and the father of now, what - about to be four kids?'\n\nThe argument took place before the couple welcomed their fourth child, Psalm, via surrogate.\n\nKanye said: \"A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?\"\n\n(Image: E!)\n\n(Image: (Credit too long, see caption))\n\nBut Kim wasn't happy with his 11th hour criticisms.\n\nShe said: \"So the night before the Met, you're gonna come in here and say that you're not into a corset bust? I'm getting really bad anxiety. What are you talking about?\n\n\"I don't need any more negative energy for you to now say that you're not into me in a tight dress.\"\n\nKanye fired back: \"You are my wife, and it affects me when pictures are too sexy.\"\n\n(Image: E!)\n\n(Image: Getty Images for THR)\n\nAnd Kim tells her husband it's because of him she has the confidence to dress the way she does.\n\nShe says: \"You built me up to be this sexy person and confidence and all this stuff.\n\n\"And just because you're on a journey and you're on a transformation doesn't mean that I'm in the same spot with you.\"\n\nKanye left after telling Kim: \"All right, cool.\"\n\n(Image: JUSTIN LANE/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nAnd Kim responds: \"That's absolutely ridiculous.\"\n\n* Keeping Up With The Kardashians airs Sundays on E! in the US and is available on hayu on Mondays\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
