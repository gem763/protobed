Crosthwaite told the Journal that the company was primarily focused on \u201cearning a license to operate in the U.S. and around the world\" after the e-cigarette industry as a whole suffered setbacks this year after studies suggested that a surge in underage use of vaping products was linked to a spike in vaping-related lung illnesses.\n\nThe company has added hundreds of employees to its staff in 2019, which now sits at a total of about 4,000, according to the Journal. Juul executives implemented a hiring freeze last month shortly before Crosthwaite became CEO.\n\nJuul's former CEO Kevin Burns stepped down late last month amid growing regulatory and public concern over teenage vape use and reports of lung illnesses on the rise among vape users.\n\n\"I have long believed in a future where adult smokers overwhelmingly choose alternative products like JUUL. That has been this company\u2019s mission since it was founded, and it has taken great strides in that direction. Unfortunately, today that future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry,\" he said at the time.", "description": "E-cigarette manufacturer Juul will cut roughly 500 jobs before the end of 2019, somewhat reversing a surge of hiring the company underwent earlier this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/juul_062519getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
