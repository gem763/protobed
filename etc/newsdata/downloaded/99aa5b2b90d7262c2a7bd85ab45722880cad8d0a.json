Seventeen were missing early Sunday, it said.\n\nA 50-year-old man was killed near Tokyo early on Saturday in a car overturned by punishing winds, while another person died after being washed away in a car, public broadcaster NHK said. Nine people remain missing in landslides and flooding, it said.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across the country as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 80 injuries have been reported so far, while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said.\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nRelated Coverage Supertyphoon Hagibis gives new wind to Philippine disco band\n\nHagibis, which means \u201cspeed\u201d in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan\u2019s main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\nMajor shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday, NHK said.\n\nEven as the typhoon moved away from the capital late on Saturday, one expert warned of further flooding as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\n\u201cThe situation is now worse than this evening,\u201d Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, told Reuters. About 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of potential for once in decades rain totals. It lifted the alerts early Sunday.\n\n\u201cDamage from floods and landslides is likely taking place already,\u201d an agency official told a news conference carried by NHK. \u201cIt is critical that people take action urgently to protect their lives and the lives of loved ones.\u201d\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nHeavy rains caused by Typhoon Hagibis flood a residential area in Ise, central Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo October 12, 2019.

Usually bustling entertainment and shopping districts such as Shibuya and Ginza were deserted.\n\nTokyo Disneyland was closed on Saturday, its first weather-related closure since 1984, and supermarkets ran out of bottled water, batteries and other disaster-related goods.\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities early, before the worst of the storm arrived.\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community centre in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\u201d Ikemura told Reuters.\n\nSlideshow (16 Images)\n\n\u201cWe brought with us the bare necessities.
