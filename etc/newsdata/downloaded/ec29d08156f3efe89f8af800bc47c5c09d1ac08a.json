Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nA survey released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California showed Warren the choice of 23% of likely primary voters, with former Vice President Joe Biden at 22% and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) at 21%. When the Democratic race was first taking shape in the spring, a Quinnipiac Poll had shown Warren in single digits in the Golden State, far behind Biden, Sanders and California Sen. Kamala Harris.\n\nIndeed, as Warren\u2019s support has surged in California \u2015 as it has nationally \u2015 the prospects for Harris in her home state have taken a hit, again reflecting national trends. Perhaps the new poll\u2019s most striking finding is that Harris trailed well behind the pack with just 8% support, another sign of trouble for her struggling campaign.\n\n\u201cWarren may well be a beneficiary of Harris\u2019 collapse,\u201d said veteran California Democratic strategist Garry South. \u201cSince her very impressive debut (as a White House candidate) in Oakland in January, Harris has done little in California to solidify whatever support may have been potentially there for her.\u201d\n\nVoters like Cindy Henderson, an author who showed up to hear Warren speak Thursday as the candidate made her first campaign stop in San Diego, give a glimpse into the race\u2019s current dynamics.\n\n\u201cI was actually a Kamala fan,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cJust something in the last two or three months, I\u2019m just kind of dropping off [on her]. I think she\u2019s not quite ready. I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s much depth yet. The more I hear and watch what Elizabeth does, it\u2019s just like, OK, she\u2019s a rock star. I\u2019m loving her message.\u201d\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren at her outdoor rally Thursday in San Diego.

(A rally for Sanders was attended by an estimated 6,400 people at the same venue in May).\n\nLike most of Warren\u2019s audiences, her Thursday crowd was predominantly white \u2015 which aligns with how her support breaks down in public opinion surveys, as well. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll released in late September showed her leading the California race with 29%, with Biden at 21% and Sanders at 20%. But Warren trailed both of those two with Latino voters.\n\nWarren mostly stuck to her populist stump speech on Thursday, laying out her plans to take on Washington corruption, special interests and big corporations. She appeared to choke up at one point as she recalled the family struggles that marked her childhood in Oklahoma, including the time her mother lost her job. The story is a big hit with many voters, who cite it when discussing the candidate.\n\nAt one point, after discussing her plan to break up big tech companies, Warren called out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told employees in recently leaked audio the company would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d to defeat her efforts.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you,\u201d she said, to cheers and applause from the audience.\n\nThe true contours of the Democratic battle will emerge in February when the narrative-driving nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina take place. But right around the corner comes primaries in 14 states on March 3, Super Tuesday. And California is the day\u2019s dominant contest, with 416 convention delegates allotted.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The Massachusetts senator is picking up steam in the Golden State as home-state Sen.
