The larger iPhone 11 Pro Max retails for $1099 (or $45.79 per month).\n\nApple also has a comprehensive trade-in program in place \u2014 you can get up to $600 off a new iPhone if you trade in last year's iPhone XS Max, bringing the cost of an 11 Pro down to as little as $399.\n\nHere's a complete list of trade-in values for fully functioning iPhones in good condition:\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nWhat's new in the iPhone 11 Pro\n\nThere are two iPhone 11 Pro models. The iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.8-inch display (the same size as the iPhone XS) and the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a 6.5-inch display (the same as the iPhone XS Max). You can choose from four colors: Space gray, midnight green, silver, and gold.\n\nBoth models add a third lens to the camera cluster on the rear of the phone, and it's the camera capabilities that really distinguish the iPhone 11 Pro from any other iPhone. In addition to the wide angle and ultra-wide angle lenses, these cameras also include a telephoto lens, giving you an optical zoom range from 0.5x to 2.0x. This means sharper pictures, from farther away.\n\nThe iPhone 11 Pro models include three rear cameras.

There's a new night mode, for example, as well as a shooting mode called Deep Fusion, which combines nine shots, including a long-exposure photo, into a single optimized high-quality image that includes the best of each.\n\nThe Pro models also have several new video tricks. In addition to shooting at 4K, 60 fps, the phone has extended dynamic range and enhanced image stabilization. Apple is also touting a feature called Audio Zoom, which lets the phone zoom in automatically in response to audio cues.\n\nThe front of the phone now features a 12-megapixel camera. Apple has added a new slow-motion selfie mode, as well as the ability to shoot in wide angle from the front as well as the rear.\n\nBoth iPhone 11 Pro models are powered by Apple's new A13 Bionic chip, which the company claims is the iPhone's fastest processor yet. Battery life is also improved \u2014 you'll get about four hours more runtime than the older iPhone XS.", "description": "The iPhone 11 Pro retails for $999, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs $1099.
