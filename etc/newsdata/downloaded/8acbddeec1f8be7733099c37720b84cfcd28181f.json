(Mary Inhea Kang/The New York Times)\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 Set incongruously in the middle of Rikers Island\u2019s post-apocalyptic landscape of low-slung jail blocks and razor wire is a lush garden, teeming with birds and butterflies, that seems to have been teleported down from some happier planet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my baby,\u201d said Mike Cruz, a stocky young man who is serving time at Rikers. He was gesturing toward a patch of flowers whose flamboyant shade of orange matched the stripes on his prison jumpsuit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Mexican sunflower,\u201d he said. \u201cI put the seeds in myself, and look at it now, it\u2019s 5 feet tall. You get to watch them grow, you feel good about that. It\u2019s like having a child.\u201d\n\nThe 2 1/2-acre garden where Cruz and three other prisoners were working is one of seven at Rikers created by the Horticultural Society of New York in partnership with the New York City Department of Correction.\n\nThe GreenHouse, as it is called, is the nation\u2019s oldest and largest prison garden. It has quietly flourished for the past three decades, a period during which rampant gang violence and a scandalous culture of abuse among the guards made Rikers the most notorious jail in America.\n\nSo when the city finally closes Rikers Island, as it plans to do by 2026, few New Yorkers will miss it. But also lost will be a garden sanctuary in the nation\u2019s largest penal colony that has a remarkable track record for keeping inmates who have worked the soil there out of prison.\n\nFor more than 500 incarcerated men and women who enter them each year, the gardens are a tranquil refuge from the chaos of jail. Not everyone, however, is charmed at first. Some don\u2019t want to wake up early \u2014 the garden workday begins at 6 a.m. Others found the idea of working with plants to be insufficiently macho.\n\nCruz\u2019s objections were more visceral.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like dirt, I didn\u2019t like bugs,\u201d he said as he prepared some flowering echinacea for a circular bed. \u201cBut I gave the garden a chance, and it\u2019s like crazy, I fell in love with it.\u201d\n\nHe says that he especially enjoys pruning the roses. \u201cIt\u2019s a thinking job, it\u2019s like a puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to figure out what bad stuff to cut out to get the good stuff to grow.\u201d Cruz now spends 20 hours a week there.\n\nThe inmates arrive at the garden by bus accompanied by two unarmed correction officers, trading their cells for a glass greenhouse, a goldfish pond, a wooden gazebo and scores of raised soil beds growing organic vegetables and herbs. There are peach trees, fig trees and papaya trees. There is a grape arbor, as well as a chest-tall patch of native plants thronged with butterflies and bees, visited by the occasional opossum.\n\nIt is almost certainly the only place on the island where the incarcerated call the shots. Aided by a team of experts from the Horticultural Society (the Hort, as it\u2019s known to those involved), the inmates plan the gardens and landscaping, build the sheds and other small structures and choose seeds from a catalog during the winter.\n\nThe men don\u2019t always come with prior knowledge of the flowers that they are ordering, according to Hilda Krus, the director of the GreenHouse, so they tend to choose ones with beguiling, feminine-sounding names. One participant loved a showy perennial he had tended there so much that he named his first daughter Chrysanthemum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss this garden,\u201d said Keith Johnson, whose 10 1/2-month stay on the island ends in a few weeks. \u201cBut not Rikers,\u201d he added.\n\nJohnson, who has been offered a paid internship with the Hort after he is released, was raking a path as a flock of Guinea fowl (a gift from a prison farm on Long Island) clucked and pecked for insects around his feet.\n\n\u201cPeople are especially fond of Limpy, a bird that was hurt when it flew into a barbed wire fence,\u201d Krus said. \u201cThey say, \u2018This bird is like me, I\u2019m also injured, they might want to get rid of me, but they won\u2019t succeed.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe same care goes to damaged or unattractive plants that would be thrown away in most other gardens. \u201cThe students tell me, \u2018We don\u2019t want to get rid of things that are imperfect.\u2019 They do everything that they can to save them,\u201d Krus said.\n\n\u201cDevelopment in a garden is slow,\u201d she added. \u201cSome things change overnight, but most things develop slowly.\u201d\n\nWhen the GreenHouse started, its aims were modest. In the late \u201980s, a single volunteer, Barbara Margolis \u2014 a Hort board member and official in the administration of Mayor Edward Koch \u2014 funded a small garden, where she socialized with inmates and offered them employment advice. The garden expanded, and it was eventually promoted as a job-training program, which was enthusiastically supported by the city, eager to demonstrate that it was equipping people for life after prison.", "description": "NEW YORK -- Set incongruously in the middle of Rikers Island's post-apocalyptic landscape of low-slung jail blocks and razor wire is a lush garden, teeming with birds and butterflies, that seems to have been teleported down from some happier planet.\"That's my baby,\" said Mike Cruz,", "authors": ["Richard Schiffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JNsg.Li2BUo.kMTgt7_LvQ--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MzYwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/447ab6731af70a4d7c551f8fa7984297", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
