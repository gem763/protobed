It has 18 unicycles, each costing 7,000 naira ($23)and requiring regular maintenance.\n\nPupils put on paid performances at events and carnivals and also impromptu shows at market venues when in need of urgent funds for costumes, unicycles and, sometimes, food.\n\nThey take home money from their performances, Kuyoro said, and also show off their skills in Instagram posts, where the school's account has more than 16,000 followers.\n\n\"People really don't know what it is, like a broken bike. They are like 'What is the future for this thing? I'd rather put my child in football academy.' So I have to talk to them,\" he said, adding the daily rehearsals kept pupils from hanging out on the streets.\n\n\"We take a lot of kids out of the street ... so what they are doing now is channelling their energy towards productive thing instead of doing funny things.\" ($1 = 306.4000 naira) (Reporting by Nneka Chile; Editing by Marie-Louise Gumuchian and Timothy Heritage)", "description": "In a driveway of a suburban Lagos house, 14-year-old Kehinde Oguntokun juggles colourful circus clubs as he swings around on a unicycle.
