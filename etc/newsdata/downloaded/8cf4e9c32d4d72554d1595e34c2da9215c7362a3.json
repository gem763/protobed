REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLate on Tuesday, Johnson won parliament\u2019s support for an election in early December that he hopes will break the Brexit deadlock and lead to the approval of the deal he clinched with Brussels earlier this month.\n\nJohnson has said his deal is the only solution to the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy since the 2016 referendum.\n\nBy contrast, the opposition Labour Party wants to negotiate a new deal and put it to a second referendum, which could overturn 2016\u2019s result.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Brexit plan opens the door to much looser economic ties between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said that the economic cost of a more distant relationship would outweigh the gains from ending Brexit uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect there to be a \u2018deal dividend\u2019 at all,\u201d NIESR economist Arno Hantzsche said. \u201cA deal would reduce the risk of a disorderly Brexit outcome but eliminate the possibility of a closer economic relationship.\u201d\n\nUnlike his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s deal, Johnson\u2019s does not require England, Scotland and Wales to stay in a customs union with the EU in the future, making tariffs and other barriers likely after a transition period.\n\nNIESR estimated that in 10 years\u2019 time, Britain\u2019s economy would be 3.5% smaller under Johnson\u2019s plan than if it stayed in the EU - roughly equivalent to losing the economic output of Wales.\n\nIn a scenario of ongoing uncertainty similar to now - where Britain keeps the economic benefit of unrestricted access to EU markets but without any long-term guarantees - the economy would be 2% smaller, it forecast.\n\nMay\u2019s deal would have limited the damage to 3.0%, while a no-deal Brexit would make the economy 5.6% smaller than if it stayed in the bloc, NIESR said.\n\nEarlier this month another academic think tank, UK in a Changing Europe, estimated Johnson\u2019s deal would make Britain more than 6% poorer per head.\n\nIn the nearer term, NIESR said the Bank of England should cut interest rates to 0.5% from 0.75% at a meeting next week, but said it did not expect the BoE to act until March, when Governor Mark Carney\u2019s successor is due to be in place.\n\nThe BoE has been an outlier among major central banks in not loosening policy as the global economy slows.\n\nNIESR said inflation was likely to undershoot the BoE\u2019s target, especially if sterling rallied on the basis of a reduced risk of no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe think-tank forecast Britain\u2019s economy would grow 1.4% this year and next, assuming no major short-term change to Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, down from 1.6% in 2018 and well below its long-run average.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal would hurt Britain's economy more than further delays and continued uncertainty about leaving the European Union, a think tank said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["David Milliken", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446346189&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T006", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
