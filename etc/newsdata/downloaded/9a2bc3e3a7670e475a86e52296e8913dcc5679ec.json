We\u2019re protesting against government inaction.\u201d\n\nHe was eventually removed. The flight to Amsterdam had to be cancelled and a spokeswoman for BA said \u201cwe are investigating what happened as a matter of urgency\u201d.\n\nThe group said they were protesting plans to expand the airport, which aims to have 6.5 million passengers a year by 2022 compared to 4.8 million in 2018, and which has said there could be demand for as many as 11 million by 2035.\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion protester stands on the top of the roof during a demonstration at London City Airport, in London, Britain, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nOn Thursday, 18,000 passengers were due to arrive or depart from the airport, with 286 flights scheduled. While some protesters got inside the terminal building, flights were continuing, though some were delayed.\n\nAn Aer Lingus plane was forced to stop taxiing and return to its gate when a passenger got up to give a speech about climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry to disturb everybody here. We have two generations of human civilisation left if we carry on doing what we\u2019re doing,\u201d the unnamed man said in a video of the incident, as he politely declined efforts by staff and passengers to get him to sit down.\n\nAer Lingus said that a passenger was removed from the flight to Dublin due to \u201cdisruptive behaviour on board\u201d.\n\nExtra security measures at the airport meant that most of the protesting happened well away from the runway.\n\n\u201cThere are no longer any protesters outside the airport terminal but we continue to work with the Metropolitan Police to ensure that our passengers tonight and tomorrow have a safe and secure service,\u201d airport chief executive Robert Sinclair said.\n\nProtesters glued themselves to the terminal building, occupied a nearby Docklands Light Railway (DLR) station and blocked roads around the airport.\n\nThe airport action came as protesters try to shut down London with two weeks of civil disobedience, leading to a large number of arrests.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\n\u201cWe have now arrested over a thousand people,\u201d said Laurence Taylor, the officer in charge of the police operation.\n\n\u201cWe have been policing City Airport today where activists have attempted to try and disrupt the operation of the airport, including people outside and some interesting attempts airside, where one man had glued himself to the top of an aircraft. He has of course now been removed.\u201d\n\nThe airport said it was \u201ccommitted to building a more sustainable future for the airport and the aviation industry\u201d and has said it will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. British Airways owner IAG also pledged on Thursday to meet that emissions target.", "description": "A protester lay on top of a plane while another forced a jet to turn around on the runway as climate change activists descended on London City Airport on Thursday, causing some flight disruption as the number of arrests this week topped 1,000.", "authors": ["Henry Nicholls", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439211179&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990R9", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
