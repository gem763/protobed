Some guests felt like they had to make a choice between designers since many shows were off-schedule and conflicted with the official diary. Here are the key takeaways from New York Fashion Week.\n\nBrooklyn Rising\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 A model walks the runway for Brandon Maxwell during New York Fashion Week on September 7, 2019 in New York City.

There was a big emphasis on outdoor shows -- Carolina Herrera took place downtown in Battery Park, Maryam Nassir Zadeh on a Lower East Side sports court and Kate Spade in the charming Elizabeth Street Garden.\n\nTheater and performance\n\nRachel Zoe, Joan Smalls, Ansel Elgort, Miley Cyrus, Russell Westbrook, Amber Valletta and Naoki Kobayashi attend Tom Ford's show, which took place at the Bowery Street subway station.

Tom Ford, for example, took his guests underground in a deserted subway station where the platform doubled as a runway. Drinks were flowing, there were real subway workers, and booming music gave the whole show a downtown cool vibe.\n\nEmerging designer Susan Alexandra, known for her beaded handbags, re-created a bar mitzvah complete with food, music and super-sized versions of her handbags in balloon format.\n\nDesigner Hillary Taymour of Collina Strada set up a farmer's market and invited guests to take the produce to emphasize her commitment to sustainability (all clothing was made from repurposed materials with the exception of jersey fabric).\n\n\"This show is my continuing attempt at reconciling the desire we all have to create and consume with the responsibility we all share to be conscious and ethical,\" said Taymour, one of 10 2019 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalists, an award that recognizes emerging American talent. \"I'm doing my best to use my platform to communicate urgent messages with positivity and honesty.\"\n\nA model walks for the Collina Strada show.

After five seasons around the world, Tommy Hilfiger came back to NYFW to showcase his Fall 2019 TommyXZendaya collection (\"See Now, Buy Now\"), a collaboration with American actress Zendaya. The event took place at the historic Apollo theater and featured live performances, singing and dancing.\n\nThat same night, Pyer Moss returned after a one-year break from runways with a show at Kings Theater, a concert hall in designer Kerby Jean-Raymond's neighborhood of Flatbush, Brooklyn.\n\nChoirs have been a staple of Pyer Moss performances in the past, and this season the Pyer Moss Tabernacle Drip Choir (formed with his show director Dario Calmese in 2015) brought together 90 singers.\n\nRihanna topped the week off with her Savage x Fenty show , featuring performances by Halsey, Migos, Tierra Whack and Dj Khaled.\n\nNew names to know\n\nA model performs during Tomo Koizumi's Spring 2020 show at New York Fashion Week on September 06, 2019.

Her hair spiked to a point, Nicholson twirled in the voluminous tulle creations in a packed one-woman show.\n\nElsewhere, rising indie label Puppets and Puppets, designed by former fine artist Carly Mark and costume designer Ayla Argentina, combined Romanov-inspired textiles and shapes with flashes of surrealism, accompanied by a strangely appealing soundscape by thereminist Dorit Chrysler.\n\nWith a tighter schedule than ever before, young crowd favorites Vaquera banded together with Section 8 and CDLM/Creatures of the Wind for a group show. Section 8's experimental netted tops and simple black and white palette marked the label as one to watch.\n\nDiversity in every sense\n\nA model walks the runway for Chromat during New York Fashion Week on September 7, 2019 in New York City.

The up-and-coming model, who had both her legs amputated as a baby, is due to appear at Paris Fashion Week later this month.\n\nMeanwhile, swimsuit brand Chromat, an avid supporter of diversity, celebrated 10 years in the fashion industry with a slew of body types, races and ages. They included body positivity campaigner Tess Holliday who walked the runway in a white, floor-length dress scrawled with the words \"sample size.\"\n\nSustainable and political\n\nA model walks the runway of Gabriela Hearst's carbon neutral show.

That's because hairdryers and hot tools were banned as the designer attempted to stage NYFW's first carbon-neutral show. The models' hair was slicked back in braids as they walked in Hearst's cotton and wool silk trenchcoats and box weave hemp dresses.\n\nMore nods to sustainability could be seen in a capsule collection by designer Maria Cornejo. Cornejo utilized upcycled textiles and leathers from car interiors in collaboration with Hyundai. The result was a very wearable set of casual dresses and trouser suits dubbed \"ReStyle.\"\n\nOne of the most political moments of NYFW may have been Prabal Gurung's runway, which marked the 10th anniversary for his brand. His collection featured elements of Americana, the country's floral emblem red roses and classic blue denim. It culminated in every model being sent down the runway wearing a pageant-style sash with the words, \"Who gets to be American?\"\n\nFinally, fashion favorite Marc Jacobs closed the week with an eclectic show that celebrated life thorough vivid prints, florals and high-volume shapes.\n\nThe next stop on this year's fashion week calendar?
