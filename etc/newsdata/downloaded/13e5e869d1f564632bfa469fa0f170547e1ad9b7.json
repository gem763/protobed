Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., center, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are seen at an event with House and Senate Democrats in the Capitol before a House vote on the \"Securing America's Federal Elections (SAFE) Act of 2019,\" on Wednesday, June 26, 2019. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) More\n\nThe SAFE Act, short for Secure and Fair Enforcement, which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday, represents a comparatively conservative approach to Canada\u2019s full legalization. If approved by the Senate, it would amend federal law so that commercial banking and other financial institutions could legally offer services to state-compliant cannabis businesses.\n\nFor the first time, those businesses would be able to open federally insured bank accounts from which they could manage deposits, as well as process paychecks, payments, and credit cards.\n\n\u2018An important aspect of opportunity and growth\u2019\n\nIn addition to opening investment avenues to Main Street investors, the bill is promising for emerging cannabis companies, which would have wider access to U.S. capital under the relaxed banking rules.\n\n\u201cAn important aspect of opportunity and growth is ensuring that cannabis businesses in the U.S. have access to capital markets,\u201d Galoob said.\n\n\u201cThe smaller players, who are perhaps not as sophisticated and do not have the resources to work through the banking relationship applications and the compliance requirements, that's tougher for them \u2014 so I do think this will be more helpful to them, rather than the bigger multi state operators,\u201d Jack Nichols, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for Harborside Inc. (HBOR.CN), said in a joint call with Galoob.\n\nLegalization advocates say Wednesday\u2019s vote will likely translate to enough support from Senate Republicans to make the SAFE Act law. House Democrats voted 99% in favor of adoption, with all but one Democrat voting yes. House Republicans voted 47% in favor of adoption.\n\n\u201cGiven the bipartisan nature of the House vote with nearly 50% of the Republican caucus voting in favor of the SAFE Banking Act, it is entirely realistic to see the bill succeed in the Senate should Leader [Sen. Mitch] McConnell give the legislation an up or down vote on the floor,\" Justin Strekal, Political Director for National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSmart Approaches to Marijuana, an advocacy group that opposed the bill, accused members of the U.S. House of Representatives of prioritizing major marijuana and Big Tobacco interests over public health.\n\nAs of Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed 12 deaths from vaping-related respiratory illness. Probable cases of illness from vaping rose to 805 confirmed cases, up from 530 last week. \"Americans are getting sick and a handful have died as a possible result of marijuana vaping. Surely this is not the time to reward Big Marijuana with investment opportunities,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Sabet, president of SAM and a former three-time White House drug policy adviser in a press release.\n\nAsked whether Tuesday\u2019s announcement concerning a presidential impeachment inquiry will slow the SAFE Act\u2019s progression, Galoob said on one hand the issue is \u201ctaking the oxygen out of the room\u201d on cannabis talks, and on the other hand it is the most bipartisan policy currently under discussion on both sides of the Hill.\n\n\u201cIt had big support from across the Congress,\u201d the bills lead sponsor, Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM on Thursday, calling it \u201ca big bipartisan victory.\u201d\n\nAlexis Keenan is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
