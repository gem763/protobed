Enthralled fans chorused in unison chants for the home team.\n\nEntirely immersed in the game at hand, the player took his place at home plate. He peered out into the field, and then stared straight at the pitcher. The crowd quieted to watch the pitch. Seconds later, there\u2019d be a new hero in town.\n\nHideki Matsui, storied Japanese baseball slugger, had made his debut at Yankee Stadium with a grand slam. For an Asian American 10-year-old like me at the time, who\u2019d already learned to brace myself for any tired Asian metalmouth supernerd tropes, the player represented a glorious hero who\u2019d possessed the ability to command respect and prompt Americans who may have never regularly interacted with an Asian dude to chant his name.\n\nI was far from the only Asian American who found their hero in the sport.\n\nFor many in the community growing up, the Asian sluggers and stars on the field were welcome, powerful wins for representation. The athletes\u2019 visibility on MLB teams was all the more striking considering that, as Asian Americans continue to meet challenges asserting our place in the U.S., the players became titans at America\u2019s favorite pastime.\n\n\u201cI gravitated towards baseball mainly because you got to see faces that look like yours,\u201d Ryan Hirano, who grew up rooting for Japanese pitcher Hideo Nomo, the player who\u2019s largely credited with starting a wave of Asian players entering the big leagues, told HuffPost.\n\nBrandon Lee, who works in the nonprofit space and idolizes the Chicago Cubs, felt similarly about the sport.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the posters you have in your room as a kid, I would\u2019ve loved to have someone who looked like me up there and it wasn\u2019t until Nomo that I had that,\u201d Lee said of the player, who\u2019s known for his legendary wind-up. \u201cI could go onto the field and play and emulate someone who looks like me.\u201d\n\nMany Asian Americans, while loyal to certain teams, went out of their way to root for any player with a similar background. The players were a vehicle for fans to reclaim their heritage in an environment scarce in proper Asian representation on-screen or in media, where it was at times difficult to feel pride for their heritage.\n\nMina Park, a baseball superfan and Texas Rangers aficionado, looked at South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park as a role model, even when he wasn\u2019t playing for the home team. While she recounts moments where she didn\u2019t feel comfortable embracing her heritage, like when she refused to bring kimchi to the lunchroom to avoid being taunted by her classmates, players like the pitcher pushed her closer to identity when he was on the field.\n\n\u201cWhenever a Korean was in the spotlight, we all [rallied] around that person and we had this sense of pride. Chan Ho Park was with the Dodgers before he actually came to the Rangers but I remember seeing the Korean community really rallying behind him,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cI had a ton of figurines with his Dodgers apparel. ... I belonged to a Korean church growing up and I remember the church would organize outings to go see Chan Ho Park when he actually joined the Rangers.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers fan added that seeing others outside of the community embrace Asian players and wear their jerseys was a heartening surprise. While many of these athletes hailed from overseas, they had found fans in an arena that \u201cfelt very American growing up,\u201d Park said.\n\nHirano echoed Park\u2019s thoughts.\n\n\u201cOther kids at school, white kids, Black kids, Latino kids, they would wear jerseys like that so it was really cool to see other people embracing Asians in that way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe belong here, and seeing that success, it felt validating to be part of something that\u2019s super American.\u201d\n\nScott Audette / Reuters Fans hold up signs congratulating Tampa Bay Devil Rays pitcher Hideo Nomo on his 200th victory at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, June 15, 2005.\n\nOf course, there were many sobering moments for fans of the Asian community as well. And the athletes\u2019 stardom could not protect them from moments of bigotry. Lee pointed out how sportscasters and media often racialized the descriptions of the players. In one particularly notable incident, Cubs broadcaster Harry Caray made a \u201cslanty\u201d eye remark while discussing Nomo.\n\nIn 2008, a shop outside the Cubs\u2019 Wrigley Field began selling a shirt, as an ode to Japanese outfielder Kosuke Fukudome, that featured a bear face with slanted eyes, wearing oversized Harry Caray-style glasses, accompanied by the words \u201cHorry Kow.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt illustrates that being a Japanese player comes its own sort of backlash,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThough the racist incidents are undeniable, neither is the cultural weight these players carried. Joon Lee, a longtime baseball fan who now reports on the Boston Red Sox for ESPN, grew up revering Korean pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim, who\u2019d become best known for his time on the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Red Sox. He pointed out that sports carry immense sway in pop culture opinion. It\u2019s one of the few areas where fans who may not typically discuss or consider political and cultural issues are forced to confront them, he said.\n\nCiting monumental figures in the civil rights movement like athletes Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, Lee pointed out that \u201csports is where a lot of American cultural change happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving an Asian voice at the table was really important because as invisible as Asian Americans often are, they have a very valuable perspective in all of this,\u201d he said.", "description": "\"I gravitated towards baseball mainly because you got to see faces that look like yours,\" said one fan.", "authors": ["Asian-American Affairs Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8e549f1e00005800749f76.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
