Most recently, Remainers also argue the country needs a second referendum in case Britons have changed their minds.\n\nOne common statement is that Britons did not vote to leave the Single Market \u2014 despite Nick Clegg, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and David Cameron having said many times during the 2016 campaign that that would be the case. Mr Cameron, who backed Remain, had said voting to leave the EU meant voting to leave the Single Market at least 28 times.\n\nWhen BBC journalist Andrew Neil confronted Mr Clegg on the fact, he could not refute it. Instead, the former Liberal Democrat leader shifted to the accusation of voter ignorance, saying: \u201cPeople don\u2019t watch the interviews between you and me. They don\u2019t watch Andrew Marr on Sunday all the time.\u201d\n\nEurocrat Verhofstadt Calls Johnson and Brexiteers \u2018Traitors\u2019 https://t.co/R8xEpo1acR \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 10, 2019\n\nMr Farage\u2019s exchange with Ms Bunting came after the European Parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt called Prime Minister Boris Johnson a \u201ctraitor\u201d for trying to take the UK out of the EU in a clean break.\n\nThe MEP for South East England also told European politicians: \u201cWe don\u2019t want your treaty in any form, even with Mr Johnson\u2019s proposed amendments. The referendum was very clear: we voted to leave the institutions of the European Union and to be free.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough of being talked down to by you [Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier], insulted by Messrs [Donald] Tusk and indeed [Jean-Claude] Juncker. We will never accept a German chancellor attempting to annex a part of our nation. We simply won\u2019t have it.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, your wretched treaty is off the table, support for a clean-break Brexit is growing, and it will be the winning ticket at the next general election.\u201d", "description": "Nigel Farage has branded a Lib Dem MEP a \"stuck-up snob\" after she said Leavers \"didn't know what they were voting on\" in the referendum.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Nigel-Farage-2-2-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
