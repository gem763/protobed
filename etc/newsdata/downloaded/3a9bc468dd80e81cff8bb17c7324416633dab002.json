Gavin Newsom (D) has signed into law a bill allowing college athletes to hire agents and sign endorsement deals, setting the stage for a likely clash with the NCAA and potentially reshaping college athletics entirely.\n\nThe first of its kind Fair Pay to Play Act is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2023, against the urging of the NCAA Board of Governors.\n\nIn a Sept. 11 letter to Newsom, the board predicted the legislation would \u201cwipe out the distinction between college and professional athletics.\u201d California schools might be banned from NCAA-sanctioned competitions over the \u201cunfair recruiting advantage\u201d offered by the bill, the group warned.\n\nNewsom wasn\u2019t persuaded.\n\n\u201cColleges reap billions from student athletes but block them from earning a single dollar,\u201d he said in a statement Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s a bankrupt model.\u201d\n\nThe governor signed the bill surrounded by athletes who advocated for the measure\u2019s adoption. That included Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, three-time WNBA champion and four-time Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi, and retired NBA star Ed O\u2019Bannon, whose 2009 lawsuit against the NCAA presented the first real legal challenge to the pay structure this new law hopes to change.\n\nNewsom said the new law presents \u201ca major problem for the NCAA.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to initiate dozens of other states to introduce similar legislation,\u201d he predicted, \u201cand it\u2019s going to change college sports for the better by having now the interest, finally, of the athletes on par with the interest of the other institutions. Now, we\u2019re rebalancing that power arrangement.\u201d\n\nThe NCAA criticized the decision Monday, warning a state-by-state approach to regulation will create a \u201cpatchwork of different laws\u201d instead of a unified and fair set of rules.\n\n\u201cWe will consider next steps in California while our members move forward with ongoing efforts to make adjustments to NCAA name, image and likeness rules that are both realistic in modern society and tied to higher education,\u201d the organization said.\n\nMaryland, North Carolina, Washington and Colorado have all considered similar laws\ufeff that would allow student athletes to profit off their likenesses.\n\n\u201cPublic universities, at the end of the day, should be looking out for the interest of their students, more than the interests of the NCAA,\u201d Maryland Del. Brooke Lierman (D) told Stateline earlier this year.\n\n\u201cState legislatures charter and have control over the public universities,\u201d she said. \u201cIf schools themselves feel they can\u2019t stand up to the NCAA, then legislatures have to do it.\u201d", "description": "The NCAA opposed the Fair Pay to Play Act, which is set to take effect on Jan. 1, 2023.", "authors": ["National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d921ce72100008207fe4118.jpeg?cache=hdvan22tne&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
