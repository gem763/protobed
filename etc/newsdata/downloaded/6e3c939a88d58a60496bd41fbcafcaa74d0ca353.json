Lautaro Mart\u00ednez had the ball and wanted to take the penalty, but Paredes prevailed after a discussion between the two. Mart\u00ednez left complaining but celebrated the goal along with his teammates.\n\nMessi was serving a three-month suspension from internationals because of comments he made against South American soccer body CONMEBOL during this year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.\n\nArgentina also was without players from Boca Juniors and River Plate because the teams are playing each other in the Copa Libertadores semifinal. Others missing from the squad were forwards \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Sergio Aguero.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Argentina routed Ecuador 6-1 in a friendly game in Spain on Sunday despite the absence of suspended Lionel Messi.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
