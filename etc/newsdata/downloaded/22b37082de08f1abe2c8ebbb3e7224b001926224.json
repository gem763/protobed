He also has support from a collective of other small parties.\n\nThe journalist and historian, who was president from 2003-2005, was a vocal critic of Morales even before announcing his latest bid for office.\n\nBolivia\u2019s 2009 constitution, promulgated by Morales himself, limits a president to two consecutive terms of office.\n\nThen in a 2016 referendum, voters defeated Morales\u2019s bid to secure public support to remove term limits, but his government rejected the result.\n\nThe constitutional court, stacked with Morales loyalists, ruled it was his right to seek re-election.\n\nMorales points to a decade of economic stability and considerable industrialization as his achievements, while insisting he\u2019s brought \u201cdignity\u201d to Bolivia\u2019s indigenous population, the largest in Latin America.\n\nBut he came under severe criticism earlier this year as wildfires in August and September ravaged Bolivia\u2019s forests and grasslands, with activists saying his policies encouraged blazes to clear farmland.\n\nEnvironmental experts said more than two million animals, including jaguars, pumas and llamas, died. A non-governmental organization said more than four million hectares (nearly 10 million acres) were destroyed.\n\nThe outcry that followed, particularly among indigenous communities, has helped boost Mesa\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBolivia\u2019s 7.3 million electorate will also vote Sunday to renew the 136-seat congress.\n\nPolls open at 8:00 am (1200 GMT) and close at 4:00 pm.\n\nNone of the other candidates are expected to come close to challenging the top two, but neither Morales nor Mesa is likely to win outright.", "description": "La Paz (AFP) \u2013 Bolivians vote Sunday to decide whether to give leftist President Evo Morales a controversial fourth term or turn their backs on the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/d55c3d_president-evo-morales-stands-accused-corruption-are-enraged-his-refusal-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
