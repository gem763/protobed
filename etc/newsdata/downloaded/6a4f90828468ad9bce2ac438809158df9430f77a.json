Unfortunately given all of the changes I\u2019ve seen in the past three months, I foresee the White House is posturing itself to be electronically compromised once again. Allowing for a large portion of institutional knowledge to concurrently walk right out the front door seems contrary to the best of interests of the mission and organization as a whole.\n\nThe above quote, taken from a memo obtained by Axios and sent by Vistakis summarizes the former director\u2019s worries. The rest of the letter paints the picture of a Trump administration hellbent on purging the Obama-appointed security specialists tasked with defending White House computers in the wake of a 2014 breach.\n\nThe Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO), according to Vistakis, has been targeted by White House leadership for removal. He reports that leaders employed tactics such as \u201chabitually being hostile\u201d to OCISO members, withholding annual bonuses, and limiting workers\u2019 job scopes in order to force them to quit.\n\nVistakis also says that, since his office was implemented, the White House has suffered no further incidents like the 2014 breach. However, it appears the Trump administration has justified the drawdown by moving the goalposts. He writes:\n\nAlso of concern is the metric leadership is leveraging to gauge success of the cybersecruity program. Measuring the success of your security staff by the frequency major compromises are identified versus the duration of time since the last compromise is absurd.\n\nVistakis greatest complaint seems to be that White House officials are prioritizing the President\u2019s comfort or convenience over actual computer security.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only technology or science related office the President\u2019s gutted. Since coming into office he\u2019s turned the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Science and Technology Council into ghost towns.\n\nClick here to read the full memo, via Axios.", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FThousands-of-American-companies-could-suffer-from-Trumps-vague-FOSTA.png&signature=c4801099f755dc0a69bd565f5c9e9d56", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
