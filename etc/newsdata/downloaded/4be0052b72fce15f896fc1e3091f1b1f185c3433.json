You have been warned.)\n\n\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d celebrated its 100th episode Wednesday with Episode 6 of \u201cAHS: 1984.\u201d And more than halfway into the season, we still have no idea what\u2019s going on.\n\nWhile Episode 906 answered some questions, those revelations created a bunch of new queries. Because there\u2019s already been so many twists, we can\u2019t help but wonder how Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk and the rest of the creatives behind \u201cAHS: 1984\u201d can possibly keep this particular horror story going for three more episodes. Truly, how many more turns can they could have in store for us?\n\nSee below for TheWrap\u2019s list of the biggest questions we have and check back next week to find out which ones have \u2014 and haven\u2019t \u2014 been answered. Since we\u2019re not quite at the end yet, we don\u2019t expect many big answers.\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: 1984' Star Zach Villa on What the Night Stalker Wants With Brooke (Video)\n\nWhat\u2019s Margaret trying to do with this festival at Camp Redwood?\n\nSo our ghost friends who are stuck at Camp Redwood forever killed some random people and didn\u2019t clean up their bodies. And in Episode 6, it\u2019s revealed Margaret (Leslie Grossman) is doing a big music festival there to try to do some capitalism on this whole situation. But why? Surely she knows this is gonna end with more murders \u2014 the question is what is she actually trying to get out of it? She must have some kind of secret plan for the event.\n\nWhat exactly is Satan trying to accomplish with all this?\n\nIn Episode 4, The Night Stalker (Zach Villa) went toe to toe with Mr. Jingles (John Carroll Lynch) and lost, suffering a gruesome death via tree limb through the skull. But as the episode ended, his body hovered in the air as his wounds healed, and he stood up looking good as new.\n\nAt the start of Episode 5, whoever or whatever is inside that body told fake Rita (Angelica Ross) they want her to go kill, just like her father did. And then by the end, that same presence in the Night Stalker\u2019s body resurrected Mr. Jingles. And then the two took off toward Los Angeles in a stolen police car.\n\nAnd now we have Satan breaking the Night Stalker out of prison. But why? Why is any of this happening? What does it all mean?\n\nWhat in the world is going on with all these dead people?\n\nAn argument you could make against Satan\u2019s involvement is all those other folks who don\u2019t worship Satan who have also been resurrected.\n\nJonas (Lou Taylor Pucci), the old camp counselor from 1970, was killed multiple times \u2014 it\u2019s happened three times so far, once in the premiere and twice in the second episode. He was murdered twice in quick succession by the Night Stalker, and he said weird things like, \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t die here.\u201d\n\nAnd then, later, he runs into Margaret and we learn that his name is Jonas and he was a camp counselor when the previous massacre happened back in 1970 \u2014 he tried to escape the camp but was run down by Mr. Jingles \u2014 a weird extra wrinkle now that we\u2019ve learned that it was actually Margaret who was responsible for the previous massacre.\n\nThis guy does not seem to be a part of Team Satan, and neither are Montana (Billie Lourd), Ray (De Ron Horton) and Xavier (Cody Fern) \u2014 and yet they were all brought back as well. There\u2019s gotta be some bigger twist for this story than just \u201cSatan is helping out the bad guys.\u201d\n\nJonas clearly has a theory, as he told Ray that the camp is now their home. And Montana came to the conclusion that they\u2019re in purgatory now. So are they ghosts or what? And if they are ghosts, what are the rules for them? They obviously still have a physical presence, since they can murder people \u2014 plus Ray like actually had sex with Brooke after he died. And this leads to our next question\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s the endgame for the ghosts?\n\nIn Episode 6, Ray astutely notes that none of them know why they\u2019re still stuck at Camp Redwood long after their deaths. Presumably, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk wrote that line in there because there\u2019s significance to that question \u2014 like there\u2019s some way for them to move on, or some purpose they need to fulfill. But what could it be? It doesn\u2019t feel like \u201cAHS: 1984\u201d has given us any hints about that yet.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(This post contains spoilers for \u201cAmerican Horror Story: 1984\u201d through the sixth episode.
