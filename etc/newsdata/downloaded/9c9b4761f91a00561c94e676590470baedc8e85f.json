If drivers go below the line to advance their position, they will be black-flagged. But if drivers are forced below the line, they won't be penalized while the car doing the forcing could be.\n\nIn the Truck Series race Saturday, Johnny Sauter finished first, but NASCAR said he forced another driver below the yellow line while blocking and his win was taken away. But when Blaney dipped below the yellow line on the last lap of the Cup Series race, officials said Ryan Newman, who Blaney made contact with on the final lap before edging him out for the win in a photo finish, forced him down there and did not hand out a penalty.\n\nSO CLOSE.\n\n\n\n0.007 seconds is the margin of victory! Relive the final restart and run to the finish by Ryan @Blaney and Ryan Newman for the win! #NASCARPlayoffspic.twitter.com/tPSghGRKyf \u2014 NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) October 14, 2019\n\n\"I thought they made the right call in the Truck race,\" Blaney told For The Win by phone Thursday. \"It's just how it played out. And it's easy for me to say they made the right call in the Cup race just because I felt like we were definitely forced.\"\n\nBlaney, who automatically advanced to the Round o f 8 in the Cup Series playoffs with the victory, also described the no-call against him \"fair and reasonable\" \u2014 though he repeatedly emphasized his bias in this situation.\n\nRyan Blaney, right, celebrates after winning the 2019 playoff race at Talladega Superspeedway.

If that wasn't in place, we'd go down the back stretch of Talladega \u2014 it's all paved now \u2014 you'd go down all the way halfway down that apron and make moves and then get back up for Turn 3. That's just causing huge wrecks, so you've gotta have something in place there.\n\n\"So I think the double-yellow line rule has to stay, and when you have situations like that, it's a call from the tower and you have to respect their judgement. I definitely don't think they should do away with it. I think it'd be chaos if they did.\"\n\nI currently disagree with both of you. https://t.co/bfkIZ5Dpag \u2014 Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) October 15, 2019\n\nBlaney explained it's difficult for him to speculate about whether or not he'd feel similarly if he were on the wrong end of a NASCAR call.\n\nHowever, the second-year Team Penske driver acknowledged that Newman, who was eliminated from the playoffs after the Round of 16 ended a few weeks ago, probably thinks he didn't force Blaney anywhere. And, despite NASCAR's explanation on the ruling, it's valid to wonder why Newman wasn't penalized if officials determined he forced Blaney below the yellow line.\n\nNoted NASCAR historian @nascarman_rr has a whole Twitter moment dedicated to the history of the controversial rule, including it being subjectively and selectively enforced. But Blaney argued that's one of the few things racing has in common with stick and ball sports \u2014 as they're referred to in the industry.\n\nThe Yellow Line Rule History/Controversy moment has been updated to include today's finish \ud83d\udc47https://t.co/sblXMyxtgF \u2014 nascarman (@nascarman_rr) October 14, 2019\n\n\"Look at other sports, that's a lot of judgement calls on the refs,\" he said. \"They've implemented a lot more replays now where you can review a lot more calls and plays, and I think that's helped out other sports because that's all judgement calls. Someone gets fouled or pass interference, that's a judgement call, and that happens a lot more, I feel like, in other sports than our sport.\"\n\nAnd just like in so many other sports, sometimes officials' decisions work in your favor and sometimes they don't \u2014 regardless of what the general consensus is, Blaney said.\n\nAll NASCAR drivers can do is keep the rule in mind and make the best split-second decision you can while driving 200 miles an hour and hope you don't spin out, he added.\n\n\"You only get one shot at making these moves; you don't get another play,\" Blaney said. \"Especially when it comes down to the last lap, you don't get another chance, so you hope the move you make is right and make sure you're in the rules and the legal part of what they allow you do to.\"\n\nAnd then hope for the best.", "description": "Ryan Blaney, who won the playoff race at Talladega Superspeedway in a photo finish, predicts \"chaos\" if NASCAR ever ditches this rule.", "authors": ["Michelle R.
