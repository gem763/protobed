One of Lee\u2019s fellow co-founders is Vince Roche, who co-founded Boost Media, a San Francisco-based ad optimization venture, and now serves as Kurvv\u2019s chief technology officer.\n\nThis month, Kurvv reported raising $1 million in a seed funding round led by SEMA Translink Investment, a Korean-American venture capital firm.\n\nLee said the investment will help his fledgling startup flesh out its business strategy and develop tools for its \u201cdata science as a service\u201d offering, or DSaaS. He said the company is already working in alpha mode with customers in eight different verticals \u2014 including e-commerce, digital marketing and nonprofit groups. (Lee declined to name names, however.)\n\nVince Roche is Kurvv\u2019s chief technology officer. (Kurvv Photo) More\n\nKurvv\u2019s business model capitalizes on the concept that not everyone needs a custom-trained deep-learning model, just as not everyone needs a custom-fitted business suit.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that most business problems don\u2019t require advanced models to solve,\u201d Lee said.\n\nIf you\u2019re dealing with medical applications or self-driving cars, you probably wouldn\u2019t want a pre-trained model that fits the data to a mere 60% or 80% level of accuracy. But that level of precision could be just fine for helping a boutique hotel figure out which high-value customers to target for an email sales promotion.\n\nThe hotel scenario was one of Kurvv\u2019s first case studies. Kurvv said the AI-assisted campaign got results within 24 hours and ended up driving $35,000 in incremental revenue.\n\nThat kind of payoff may not sound like much to the big players in the AI game, but it\u2019s enough to get small businesses interested in artificial intelligence \u2014 assuming that the price is right.\n\n\u201cBased on instances where we were able to compare, we\u2019ve found that not only were our costs 10 times less than what other well-established AI companies would charge, but also 10 times faster in terms of start to results,\u201d Lee said.\n\nRight now, Kurvv is powered by Lee, Roche and a third co-founder who\u2019s staying behind the scenes for now, plus about seven people who are working on a contract basis. Lee said he\u2019d like to hire at least one additional \u201chigh-caliber\u201d data scientist to help the venture get to the next level.\n\nKurvv isn\u2019t the only startup aiming to offer low-cost AI solutions. Seattle-based Xnor, for example, is fielding a self-service software platform called AI2GO that lets users select and download pre-packaged AI applications and deep-learning models. Another Seattle startup, Amperity, uses machine learning to leverage customer data, attracting a high level of industry buzz in the process. And looking beyond the Seattle area, there are dozens of companies jumping onto the DSaaS bandwagon.\n\nWill Kurvv get ahead of the curve? That\u2019s what Lee is counting on, and what the $1 million in seed funding is going toward.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "Artificial intelligence is a big deal for the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google \u2014 but what about a small business that can't afford to have a data scientist on staff?
