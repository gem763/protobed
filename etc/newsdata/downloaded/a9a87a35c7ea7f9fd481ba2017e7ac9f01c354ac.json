CHWY -0.59% raised revenue projections for the year, following stronger-than-expected sales in the August quarter.\n\nBut the company, which went public in June, reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss, driven by the much higher stock-based compensation expense as a public company.\n\nThe stock, which closed Tuesday slightly down at $30.25, fell 4.5% to $28.90 in extended trading. Shares, which had been priced at $22 a piece, started trading on June 14 at $36. Chewy\u2019s second-quarter net loss widened to $82.9 million, or 21 cents a share, from $63.1 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. The most recent quarter included $43.8 million in stock-based compensation costs. Sales for the quarter ended Aug. 4 rose 43% to $1.15 billion, beating the company\u2019s projected range of $1.12 billion to $1.14 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected a loss of 11 cents a share and $1.13 billion in revenue. Gross profit margin improved to 23.6% from 20.6% a year earlier. Active customers reached 12 million, compared with 11.3 million in the previous quarter and 8.6 million a year earlier. For the business year that ends Feb. 2, Chewy now expects revenue to reach $4.75 billion to $4.80 billion, compared with its earlier view of $4.68 billion to $4.75 billion. The Florida-based company was founded in 2011 and bought in 2017 by PetSmart Inc., which remains its majority owner.
