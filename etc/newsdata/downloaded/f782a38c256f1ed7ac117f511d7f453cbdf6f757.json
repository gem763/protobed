Reason? To offer concessions and discounts to specific group of commuters, like students and senior citizens, says a recent report.\n\nThe move is in line with the authority\u2019s attempt to provide concessions to the above mentioned segment of Delhi Metro users. For now, these concessions have not been decided upon, as per the housing and urban affairs minister - Hardeep Sigh Puri. These, however, will soon be finalised upon by the Delhi Metro Fare Fixation Committee (FFC), the minister confirmed in a report.\n\nIt is also unclear as to how the smart cards will be linked to the holder\u2019s identity. Speculations suggest that DMRC might go for a biometric authentication for the same - most likely your Aadhaar card. There are a handful of other options too. Though whichever one DMRC opts for, linking the smart card to a specific identity will render the smart cards non-transferable to other users.\n\nIs it good? Is it bad? Or would it have no effect whatsoever? Here we try to answer these questions.\n\n(Representative Image: BCCL)\n\nDon't Miss 259 SHARES 260 SHARES 493 SHARES\n\nWhy the move?\n\nAs mentioned above, the sole reason for linking the smart cards with one\u2019s identity is to make it easier for DMRC to offer concessions and incentives to commuters. The idea is simple, once the smart cards are linked to one\u2019s personal information like name, age and occupation, it would be a cakewalk for DMRC to categorise commuters and offer them individual concessions based on pre-set criteria.\n\nThere is another plus to the intended move. Delhi Metro has been trying to make the whole experience of commuting via metro easier for its passengers. One such aspect involves the ticketing services offered by it. To make it easier for the Delhi Metro users, the authority has been aiming to integrate the ticketing process with third-party services like PayTM.\n\nWhile the current form of integration makes it possible for smart card users to top-up their card using PayTM, there is an additional validation step involved, wherein the users have to visit the ticketing counter at metro stations even after the top up. Linking the cards to a user\u2019s identity will eliminate that need, as the validation process can be completed online through such third-party platforms. So no more visits to the ticketing counters for the smart card users.\n\nTransfer-ability?\n\nIn a TOI report, DMRC Managing Director Mangu Singh mentioned, \"When the solution is implemented, Delhi Metro travel smart card will not remain transferable.\u201d\n\nThe smart cards work on a radio-frequency identification (RFID)-based system for now. With a biometric system in place, the ownership of a smart card will remain exclusive. From what can be figured though, this will not impact the ability of these cards to be used by anyone. This is simply because there will be no system in place to check the biometric data at the station itself. So the smart cards will work something like the present Debit/ Credit card. While they will house information of a single person, anyone with access to that information will be able to use the cards.\n\n(Representative Image: BCCL)\n\nData scare\n\nNow let us clear one thing here. Linking the Delhi Metro smart cards with one\u2019s personal information through any means will not be a one-way transaction. Data exchange will take place on both ends, as information from the card itself will be sent to various mediums. At the most fundamental level, your check-in as well as check-out location and time will be recorded by the card and sent to the DMRC servers.\n\nAt present, when the cards are not linked to your name and face, the check-in, check-out time and location is just a number on the Delhi Metro servers associated with a smart card. Once these smart cards are linked to your profile, this information will ultimately be linked to YOU and not the card itself. And that is where the scary part begins.\n\nSo you are aware of the basic data exchange which will take place through these smart cards, of course, with the data being related to you. Now, scale these data points to your banking information as well, since you will top up the cards through some or the other digital medium. So, we have your profile information with the card, we know where you go at what time and now, we know your banking information as well. Scared yet?\n\nYou should probably not be because DMRC will, of course, employ some data security to the system once it is in place. The question implies, how effective and reliable will it be? Also, what will the extent to which it can safeguard the data. What if a commuter loses his/ her card. Can the data be extracted through the card itself? These questions will only be answered with time, as we will get to know which system will be used for linking the Delhi Metro smart cards. On top of that, it will be interesting to see how DMRC plans to safeguard the data of the commuters that these cards will be collecting.\n\nTo stay up to date with more such information on the Delhi Metro, join our Facebook group 'Future Transport' here:", "description": "Delhi Metro Rail Corporation might soon be linking the Metro smart cards with the owner's information through a biometric system.
