Enough!\u201d\n\nIt was backed by Spain\u2019s governing Socialist party, the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party. However, the far-right Vox party was asked to stay away.\n\nTens of thousands of demonstrators carried Spanish and Catalan flags and placards that read \u201cWe are Catalans too\u201d as they marched down Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the scene of some of the worst rioting last week.\n\nThe PP and Citizens leaders, Pablo Casado and Albert Rivera respectively, joined the march, as did prominent members of the Socialist party, though not the acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\n\nMiquel Iceta, the Catalan Socialists\u2019 party leader, said the SCC had invited his party to join the march \u201cbehind a slogan that we unequivocally support: coexistence and opposition to the independence process\u201d.\n\nCasado said Catalonia was a \u201cfundamental part of Spain\u201d, adding: \u201cAbove all, it\u2019s a land totally opposed to the violence, intolerance and sectarianism of the independence movement.\u201d\n\nRivera said: \u201cThere are more of us who want to be united than want separation.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, the pro-independence Committees for the Defence of the Republic set up roadblocks and blocked railway lines with tree trunks in an attempt to prevent protesters from reaching the march in central Barcelona. A sit-in was also staged at the city\u2019s main railway station.\n\nPlay Video 1:27 Catalonia protests: key moments from a week of unrest \u2013 video\n\nOn Saturday, about 20,000 people had joined a rally in support of Spanish unity staged in central Madrid by Vox.\n\nA huge Spanish flag, 50 metres long and 20 metres wide, was unfurled over the crowd, who called for the imprisonment of Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan president who fled to Belgium two years ago to avoid arrest for leading the push for secession.\n\nVox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, urged the suspension of Catalan self-government, saying: \u201cSpain isn\u2019t up for discussion; Spain is to be defended at all costs.\u201d\n\nCatalonia is deeply divided over the issue of independence. Popular support for seceding from Spain \u2013 which reached a record high of 48.7% in October 2017 \u2013 currently stands at 44%, with 48.3% of Catalans opposing it.\n\nThe protest on Sunday took place on the second anniversary of the illegal unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament.
