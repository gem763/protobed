The report claimed the source had to be extracted from Russia in 2017 in part because of concerns about the way President Donald Trump handled classified intelligence following a meeting with two Russian officials that May.\n\nThe information Trump shared with the Russians in 2017 wasn't related to the CIA's asset. But the president's disregard for strict intelligence-sharing rules to protect highly placed sources \"prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk\" that the source in Russia would be exposed, CNN reported.\n\nCNN also noted the Obama administration initially considered removing the asset, and that concerns for the individual's safety grew after the US intelligence community released its assessment on Russia's interference in the 2016 election.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN that its \"reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.\"\n\nRead more:'You actually have to give a s--- about your spies': Intel veterans are floored by revelations that an asset had to be extracted from Russia because of Trump's 'loose lips'\n\nLater Monday, The New York Times and NBC News followed up with additional reporting that invited immediate criticism on Twitter, because it revealed further details about the spy and their work.\n\nThe Times disclosed that the intelligence asset had been sending secrets to the US for decades but was extracted after the media began learning details of the CIA's assets in the Kremlin following revelations about Russia's election interference.\n\nThe report described the individual's position in the Russian government, the level of access they had to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and their role in helping US intelligence agencies discover Russia's interference campaign in the 2016 election.\n\nCrucially, the report said officials did not disclose the source's identity or location because both are \"closely held secrets\" and the person's life remains in danger.\n\nShortly after, NBC News published its own report which revealed where the spy lives and other details about their home. The news came as Russian state-sponsored media reported that it had a name for the suspected intelligence asset.\n\nThe Times and NBC did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment, and it's unclear if government officials asked them to withhold any details for national security reasons.\n\nRead more: Trump and the Taliban are telling wildly different stories about why he canceled a planned meeting at Camp David days before the 9/11 anniversary\n\nRussia has previously targeted former spies, like Sergei Skripal and Alexander Litvinenko.\n\nMonday's events bear a resemblance to what happened after The Washington Post first reported that Trump had shared sensitive information with Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, and Sergey Kislyak, then Russia's ambassador to the US, during their May 2017 Oval Office meeting.\n\nThe Post reported that Trump had disclosed to the Russians what officials described as \"highly-classified information\" related to an Islamic State terror plot. Several outlets later reported that the plan involved putting a bomb on a commercial airliner.\n\nShortly after, The Times, citing current and former officials, identified Israel as the source of the intelligence. CBS later revealed that the Islamic State had been developing a laptop bomb at Mosul University that could evade airport scanners.\n\nAxios, citing national security experts, speculated that \"lives could well be lost as a result of an ISIS mole hunt that's sure to follow\" Trump's disclosure. But less attention was paid to the media's role in making some of the information public.\n\nJames Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, told CNN on Monday that revelations about the spy's extraction are \"going to make recruiting assets in Russia even more difficult tan it already is.\" (He also noted that he understood that CNN reporter Jim Sciutto was doing his job.)\n\nAsked if disclosures like those on Monday put sources at risk, one former senior Justice Department official who worked closely with the former special counsel Robert Mueller when he was FBI director told Insider, \"Without a doubt.\"", "description": "Trump has been known to play it fast and loose with intelligence, but in this case, it looks like the media might be doing some serious damage.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell", "Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5a0dc24635876e1c008b6748-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
