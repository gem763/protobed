USA TODAY\n\nPrince Harry and Ed Sheeran are bringing awareness to World Mental Health Day with a sense of humor.\n\nIn honor of the day observed annually on Oct. 10, the two made a comical video which both shared to their Instagram accounts Thursday.\n\n\"Really excited today,\" the musician begins as someone shapes his beard. \"I'm gonna go and, uh, film a thing with Prince Harry. (He) contacted me about doing a charity video with him, which is gonna be good. I've long admired him from afar.\"\n\nOnce together, the royal thanks him for coming out, in his mind to support World Mental Health Day. \"This, for me, is a subject and a conversation that's just not talked about enough,\" Harry said. \"I mean, people all over the world are really suffering.\"\n\n'Don't behave like this': Prince Harry rejects a reporter's questions in tense moment\n\nThe two agree to write a song and seem to be on the same page/sheet of music until it's obvious they are not.\n\n\"People just don't understand what it's like for people like us,\" Sheeran says. \"The jokes and the snide comments, and I just feel like it's time we stood up and said, 'We're not going to take this anymore. We're ginger, and we're going to fight.' \"\n\n\"Um, OK,\" Harry says, stumbling. \"Slightly awkward. This might have been maybe a miscommunication, but this is about World Mental Health Day.\"\n\nPrince Harry compares 'malicious' media coverage of Duchess Meghan to late Princess Diana\n\nSheeran looks at the camera, shocked. \"Oh, yeah, yeah,\" he says. \"Of course. No, no. I definitely knew that.\" The artist then begins hitting backspace on his laptop's keyboard on a document with a head that read \"GINGERS UNITE.\"\n\nBeneath that, \"HRH Prince Harry and the king of ging Ed Sheeran get together to change the perception of people with Moroccan sunset hair.\"\n\nGetting serious, the prince, beside Sheeran, ends the video by encouraging viewers to check in on people they know.\n\n\"Guys, this World Mental Health Day, reach out, make sure that your friends, strangers, look out for anybody that might be suffering in silence. We're all in this together.\"\n\nHarry has long been an advocate of mental health, spearheading the campaign Heads Together launched in 2016, along with Prince William and Duchess Kate.\n\nHe previously opened up about his own struggles following the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. He spoke of its impact in an 2017 interview with The Telegraph.\n\n\"I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,\" Harry said at the time. \"And it was only three years ago \u2013 funny enough \u2013 from the support around, and my brother and other people saying that, 'You really need to deal with this. It's not normal to think that nothing's affected you.'\"\n\nHarry said instead of processing his grief for The People's Princess, he stifled his emotions.\n\n\"My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?\" he shared. \"It\u2019s only going to make you sad; it\u2019s not going to bring her back. So, from an emotional side, I was like \u2018Right, don\u2019t ever let your emotions be part of anything.' So, I was a typical sort of 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going \u2018Life is great\u2019, or \u2018Life is fine\u2019 and that was exactly it.\"\n\nHarry said that when he began having the conversations he previously avoided he began to understand, \"'There's actually a lot of stuff here I need to deal with...'\u201d\n\n\"It was 20 years of not thinking about it and then two years of total chaos,\" Harry recalled. \"I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on it. I just didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me.\"\n\nPrince Harry turns 35, gets a sweet photo tribute from Duchess Meghan\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/10/prince-harry-ed-sheeran-promote-world-mental-health-day-instagram/3927859002/", "description": "Prince Harry and Ed Sheeran are bringing awareness to World Mental Health Day with a sense of humor in a video shared to Instagram.", "authors": ["Erin Jensen", "Published A.M.
