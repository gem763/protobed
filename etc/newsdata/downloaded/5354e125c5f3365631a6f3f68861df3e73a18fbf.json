(Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nThe CEO of GitHub \u2014 a popular platform for hosting, sharing and reviewing code \u2014 on Tuesday pledged to donate $500,000 to nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by the Trump administration.\n\nSome employees at GitHub said in an open letter obtained by The Washington Post they interpreted the donation as a way to mitigate GitHub\u2019s decision in September to renew a contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The agency licenses a version of GitHub\u2019s software that can be used to store, host and collaborate on code.\n\nBut those employees object to ICE\u2019s treatment of immigrants, as well as their company\u2019s role in helping ICE, and say philanthropy can\u2019t make up for the damage to individuals and families.\n\n[The war inside Palantir: Data-mining firm\u2019s ties to ICE under attack by employees]\n\n\u201cWe cannot offset human lives with money,\u201d employee activists wrote in the letter to chief executive Nat Friedman on Wednesday morning. \u201cThere is no donation that can offset the harm that ICE is perpetrating with the help of our labor.\u201d\n\nThe letter received more than 150 signatures out of roughly 1,300 GitHub employees in less than an hour, including a signature from one of the company\u2019s vice presidents, according to an employee who opposes the contract and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\n\n[Read the letter from GitHub employees]\n\nGitHub did not immediately respond to questions but pointed to Friedman\u2019s Tuesday memo as the company\u2019s statement on its contract with ICE. Microsoft, which owns GitHub, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn his memo, Friedman said that the ICE contract began in April 2016 as a license agreement to use GitHub servers and that the original purchase and recent renewal of the contract were done through a third-party reseller partner. He also said the revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000.\n\n[Amazon employees demand company cut ties with ICE]\n\nFriedman added that the $500,000 donation is \u201cin excess of the value purchase by ICE.\"\n\nThe letter is part of a sustained protest from tech employees over the past couple of years in opposition to the Trump administration\u2019s use of tech provided by their employers to enforce immigration policies. Amazon, Microsoft, Palantir and other tech giants have faced internal consternation that tech from their companies is being used for that purpose. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nLast year, Microsoft employees posted an open letter protesting the company\u2019s work with ICE.\n\nA few weeks ago, the CEO of Chef, a Seattle-based software company, agreed not to renew a contract with ICE, reversing his position after employee protest, including deleting code from GitHub. GitHub is used by 40 million developers and serves as a pillar of the open-source software community.\n\n[U.S. defends secretive Mississippi ICE raids as local, state officials decry effect on children]\n\nSome GitHub employees have been meeting with company leadership since July to oppose the contract with ICE, according to the employee familiar with internal deliberations. During a meeting last week, some activist employees told those in leadership that a donation would not suffice and that the company needed to cancel the contract, according to the employee. The employee said activists inside GitHub planned to circulate an internal petition protesting the company\u2019s work with ICE this week.\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, Friedman sent the companywide memo promising the $500,000 donation.\n\nMicrosoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion in June 2018, and the company operates as a wholly owned subsidiary. Before the acquisition, GitHub raised $350 million in venture capital funding.", "description": "Employees sent an open letter to Github's CEO asking the company to shed its contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement", "authors": ["Nitasha Tiku", "Tech Culture Reporter Based In San Francisco", "October At Pm", "Nitasha Tiku Is The Washington Post'S Tech Culture Reporter Based In San Francisco."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DIcPjzANEqpvGBJ_y77EAsVNPDs=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2LRJOGTICQI6RIZVYRID2BA6V4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
