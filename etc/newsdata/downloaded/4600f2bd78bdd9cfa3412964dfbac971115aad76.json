deal given fatal blow as Angela Merkel rejects Boris\u2019s plan", "language": "en", "text": "Boris Johnson has been given the cold shoulder by EU leaders (Picture: Getty)\n\nDowning Street claims Brussels has made it \u2018essentially impossible\u2019 for Boris Johnson to get a new Brexit divorce deal.\n\nA source at Number 10 said talks were close to officially breaking down following an early morning phone call between Boris Johnson and Angela Merkel.\n\nThe German chancellor is said to have made clear that a deal would only be possible if Northern Ireland were to stay in the Customs Union.\n\nDowning Street called it a \u2018clarifying moment\u2019 and said this meant that a Brexit deal would never be possible with the EU.\n\nLabour accused the Tories of a \u2018cynical attempt to sabotage the negotiations\u2019 and demanded Parliament unite and step in to stop us crashing out in three weeks\u2019 time.\n\nWhile European Council president Donald Tusk accused Mr Johnson of jeopardising the future security of the EU and the UK and indulging in a \u2018blame game.\u2019\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is said to have demanded that Northern Ireland remain in the customs union (Picture: Getty)\n\nSpeaking after the 8am phone call between Mr Johnson and the German leader, the Number 10 source said: \u2018The call with Merkel showed the EU has adopted a new position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She made clear a deal is overwhelmingly unlikely and she thinks the EU has a veto on us leaving the Customs Union.\n\n\u2018Merkel said that if Germany wanted to leave the EU they could do it no problem but the UK cannot leave without leaving Northern Ireland behind in a customs union and in full alignment forever.\n\n\u2018She said that Ireland is the government\u2019s special problem and Ireland must at least have a veto on NI leaving.\n\n\u2018Merkel said that it must stay in full alignment forever, but that even this would not eliminate customs issues.\n\n\u2018It was a very useful clarifying moment in all sorts of ways.\n\n\u2018If this represents a new established position, then it means a deal is essentially impossible not just now but forever.\n\n\u2018It also made clear that they are willing to torpedo the Good Friday Agreement.\u2019\n\nMs Merkel has yet to comment on this leak but political commentators in Europe said this did not sound like either her approach or her usual use of language.\n\nMeanwhile Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, warned Mr Johnson that \u2018what\u2019s at stake\u2019 over Brexit \u2018is not winning some stupid blame game.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t want a deal, you don\u2019t want an extension, you don\u2019t want to revoke, quo vadis?\u2019\n\nThe main issue is the border on the island of Ireland (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe main focus is on how to replace the so-called Irish backstop \u2013 the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Good Friday peace agreement, which brought an end to 40 years of conflict, made clear that the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic needed to remain open.\n\nKeeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union \u2013 meaning they followed EU trade rules \u2013 would keep the border open.\n\nBut, it would see part of the UK subject to different laws which is unacceptable to Mr Johnson and his allies, the DUP party in Northern Ireland.\n\nMr Johnson claimed his new blueprint to replace the Irish backstop represented a \u2018big step forward and a compromise.\u2019\n\nHowever, he has not released many details but said both sides would need to commit to never introducing checks on the Irish border.\n\nThe EU sees this as an unacceptable loss of control and said the plan does not represent the basis for a new Brexit settlement.\n\nThe EU Commission even asked if there was a mistake in the text sent by Mr Johnson\u2019s team.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk has accused Boris Johnson of a \u2018stupid blame game\u2019 (Picture: AFP)\n\nLabour said Mr Johnson\u2019s new deal was \u2018never credible\u2019 and accused the Tories of \u2018sabotaging\u2019 negotiations.\n\nShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has now called on Parliament to unite to prevent \u2018this reckless government crashing us out of the EU.\u2019\n\nAs the clock ticks down, a new \u2018Brexit readiness document\u2019 is set to be published later today.\n\nNo-deal planning chief, Michael Gove, will detail all the preparations that have been made in case we crash out of the bloc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Johnson is still adamant the UK will leave on October 31, despite a law by rebel Tories and opposition groups making a no-deal Brexit illegal.\n\nParliament is set to be prorogued later today and will open again with the Queen\u2019s Speech on Monday.\n\nThere are now just nine days before the crunch Brussels summit \u2013 which is the deadline set by the House of Commons for Mr Johnson to come up with a deal.\n\nTory sources have said Mr Johnson might even boycott next week\u2019s summit.\n\nMeanwhile EU diplomats have suggested leaders could use the summit to instead discuss another Brexit extension, despite the fact Mr Johnson has ruled out asking for one.", "description": "Downing Street claims
