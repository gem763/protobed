After all, stocks don\u2019t IPO or hit the public markets at that kind of price tag. Thus, if a stock is below $10, it is because investors sold the stock off to that level. Usually, such intense selling to below $10 is sign of glaring fundamental weakness.\n\nHaving said that, there are some hidden gems in the under-$10 group of stocks. All of these stocks have gone through rough times. But, not all of them will go through rough times forever. Fundamentals aren\u2019t static. They are dynamic. They can change from good to bad, and from bad to good. When the fundamentals for a sub-$10 stock change from bad to good, you usually get big returns in that stock because it was so beaten up to begin with.\n\nBut when warnings signs begin flashing, investors need somewhere secure to grow their money. During the financial crisis, investors naturally panicked as the markets plunged, while a small group of traders were able to actually profit. An aversion to losses can be beneficial, but it can also cause you to hold on to losers too long and sell winners too soon. By investing in bulletproof stocks, you can shut off that part of your investing brain that tells you to panic.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that in mind, I have identified seven stocks under $10 which have been beaten up, but look ready to benefit in a big way from improving fundamentals over the next few quarters to years. In other words, these are depressed stocks which have enormous rebound potential in the foreseeable future.\n\nWho made the cut? Let\u2019s take a closer look at potential stocks to buy under $10.\n\n\n\n\n\nStocks to Buy Under $10: General Electric (GE)\n\nStocks to Buy Under $10: General Electric (GE) More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnce one of the most valuable and important companies in the world, industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE), has tumbled over the past several years. Now the company is a shell of its former self. About 20 years ago, this was a $50 stock. Today GE stock trades below $10.\n\nGE stock has tumbled to below $10 for a good reason. The business became overly complicated and convoluted, and once one of the moving parts in the GE machine started deteriorating, the whole machine started to fall apart. At the same time, in order to build the big and overly complex GE machine, GE took out a ton of debt, so when GE\u2019s businesses started to shrink over the past several years, they did so against the backdrop of an overly levered balance sheet \u2014 which just made everything worse.\n\nBut, everything could get better over the next few quarters to years. That is, General Electric is dramatically simplifying its operations by shedding non-core, unprofitable businesses and assets. The company is taking the proceeds from those business and asset divestitures to pay down debt. Thus, GE going forward is going to be simpler, more profitable, and less indebted. Ultimately, that means GE is turning into a better business, which should be rewarded with a higher multiple and bigger earnings power \u2014 a combination which produces a bigger stock price for GE.\n\nConsequently, at current levels, GE stock looks fairly compelling. This beaten up company is doing everything right to make things better. As things do get better over the next several quarters to years, GE stock should bounce back.\n\n\n\n\n\nFord (F)\n\nSource: overcrew / Shutterstock.com\n\nMuch like General Electric, auto giant Ford (NYSE:F) is a fallen U.S. business titan that presently looks like a shell of its former self.\n\nStory continues", "description": "I've said it before on InvestorPlace, and I'll say it again: stocks in the under-$10 group typically aren't great stocks.
