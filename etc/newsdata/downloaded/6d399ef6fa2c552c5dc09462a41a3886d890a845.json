But the expansion of the city\u2019s scooter operators isn\u2019t all good news: Skip, one of the companies that was part of San Francisco\u2019s original pilot program, wasn\u2019t granted a permit and just sent a message to customers saying that it would cease service.\n\n\u201cStarting today, October 15, Skip scooters will no longer be rentable as part of SFMTA\u2019s Powered Scooter Share Program for 2019-2020,\u201d the company said in a message to users, which was obtained by The Verge. \u201cOver the last year, it\u2019s been a privilege to serve you and invest in our hometown, the city of San Francisco. We hope to see you again soon.\u201d\n\nSkip was one of two companies awarded a permit under San Francisco\u2019s original pilot program in August 2018. (The other was Scoot.) But with the appearance of 2,500 additional scooters on the city\u2019s streets this past week, Skip is calling it quits. The company still operates scooters in Washington, DC, San Diego, and Austin.\n\nIn a statement to The Verge, Skip CEO Sanjay Dastoor laid much of the blame at the feet of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. \u201cSkip was one of two operators in the San Francisco pilot for scooter sharing this past year,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we were the sole existing operator not selected for the upcoming year\u2019s expansion. The past two weeks have been both humbling and awful for our team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis show of thoughtlessness and disrespect left us scrambling\u201d\n\nDastoor said Skip repeatedly sought guidance on SFMTA\u2019s decision regarding their permit renewal, to no avail. \u201cUnlike permit grantees, we did not receive news that we were not admitted into the program until we read it in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cThis show of thoughtlessness and disrespect left us scrambling to respond to our panicked employees.\u201d\n\nSFMTA \u201cdodged and denied\u201d the company\u2019s request for meetings, Dastoor claimed. And now as a result of the permitting decision, Skip will have to lay off dozens of employees, he said.\n\n\u201cWe respect SFMTA\u2019s authority to administer a program how they see fit,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThat said, we believe Skip is the best operator positioned to serve San Francisco and for the past 12 months, we\u2019ve demonstrated this admirably. We also ask that, pending our appeal, SFMTA grant our company a stay to allow us to continue operating and employing our team in San Francisco.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for SFMTA did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nUnder the expanded program, Jump, Lime, and Spin are allowed to operate 500 scooters each, while Bird\u2019s Scoot will have 1,000, down from 1,250 scooters it was permitted to operate previously. (The company, which was acquired by Bird earlier this year, remains in \u201cgood standing\u201d with the city despite the fleet reduction.) The limit for new operators will increase to 750 scooters on December 15th and to 1,000 on February 15, 2020, as long as they are compliant with the terms of the program.\n\nThe city is also initiating a \u201cmore stringent\u201d process for tracking complaints and scooter scofflaws.
