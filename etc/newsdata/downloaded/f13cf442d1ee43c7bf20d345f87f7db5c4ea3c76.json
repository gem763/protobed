Although, this time, it\u2019s for a very different reason.\n\nWhen Stuart realised that his brother Callum (Tony Clay) was developing feelings for Ben, the Highway hard-man went out of his way to prevent the Mitchell lad from getting in the way of his brother\u2019s romance with Whitney (Shona McGarty). Back in June, he threatened Ben in the toilets of the Queen Vic then, in July, he brutally assaulted him in The Arches and left him for dead, then \u2014 on the night of Callum\u2019s Stag Do in August \u2014 he knocked him unconscious and put him in a car boot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it\u2019s pretty clear that Stuart just doesn\u2019t like Ben \u2014 though we can\u2019t imagine why! However, you\u2019d think he\u2019d manage to put the contempt he feels for the Mitchell heir to one side given that Callum is beginning to date him, but unfortunately that\u2019s not the case, as he threatens to assault Ben once again.\n\nHowever, this time, his anger isn\u2019t actually directed at Ben, but rather at his mum, Kathy (Gillian Taylforth). The Beale matriarch has been doing all she can to help Rainie (Tanya Franks) with her drug addiction but, in spite of her good intentions, Stuart doesn\u2019t take too kindly too her meddling, so he pays her a visit in the cafe and threatens to hurt both Ian (Adam Woodyatt) and Ben for what\u2019s transpired.\n\nWill he carry out his threat?\n\nLet\u2019s hope not \u2014 for Ben\u2019s sake!\n\nMind you, if there\u2019s one word that can be used to describe Ben, \u2018resilient\u2019 certainly comes to mind. Yes, since coming home, the young man has been punched by just about everyone in the Square, threatened repeatedly, beaten to within an inch of his life on at least three occasions, and shot in the stomach once. We reckon his chances would be pretty good either way!\n\nBut, nonetheless, perhaps give Ben a break now, eh Stuart?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 18th October at 7:30pm on BBC One.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Leave Ben alone!", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/18639981-low_res-eastenders-october-december-2019-5a83_1570007180.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
