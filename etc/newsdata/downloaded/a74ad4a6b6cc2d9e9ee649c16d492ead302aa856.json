The situation improves in urban areas, especially in the capital city, where around 50% of households are connected to the grid. Some three million people live in Antananarivo, where much of the island\u2019s economic activity is concentrated.\n\nThere can only be industrial and economic growth if there is energy. Hyacinthe Befeno Todimanana Chairman, Jirama\n\nBut Madagascar\u2019s infrastructure is old and dilapidated, and illegal connections are widespread, resulting in frequent power cuts.\n\nThe goal for authorities is to reorganise the production and distribution of electricity. Their aim: to be more efficient, more cost-effective, and eventually, more environmentally-friendly.\n\nState-owned electric utility and water services company Jirama says the priority is to upgrade the network.\n\nUpgrading Madagascar\u2019s dilapidated grid\n\n\u201cIn order to renovate, you need to invest, and that takes time. Our business plan, developed this year, aims to straighten things out over the next three years. By 2020, we hope to break the cycle of dependency and sort out the distribution irregularities, so we can have a stable, high quality electricity supply.\u201c\n\nOlivier Jaomiary, Managing Director, Jirama\n\n\u201cThere can only be industrial and economic growth if there is energy. So it is essential that we achieve growth in energy production and improve people\u2019s access to electricity as fast as possible.\u201c\n\nHyacinthe Befeno Todimanana, Jirama chairman\n\nThe challenge is twofold: to cater to both the population\u2019s and the economy\u2019s growing needs in electricity, and to produce cheaper electricity to reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels for the plants.\n\nReducing energy dependency: replacing diesel with heavy oil\n\nJirama\u2019s aim is to gradually replace power plants running on diesel with plants that run on heavy oil, which are cheaper. Two Heavy Oil Fuel plants have been built over the past year just outside the capital by the Jovena group.\n\n\u201cThis plant has two advantages: first, it meets growing energy needs with a capacity of 48 Megawatts. It also allows authorities to cut costs by transitioning from diesel to heavy oil.\u201c\n\nBenjamin Memmi, Managing Director, Jovena Madagascar\n\nDiversification\n\n\u201cIf you look at the complete chain, from diesel, which was an immediate need to address the issues, they are migrating to HFO (Heavy Fuel Oil). They are also, in parallel, trying to develop solar and hydro. So it will give them a good energy mix and a stable power supply.\u201c\n\nRajesh Singhal, Director, Aksaf Power\n\nJIRAMA : Application du syst\u00e8me d\u2019hybridation dans la production \u00e9lectrique https://t.co/X73kHTM776 \u2014 Eco de Madagascar (@MDGEco) 5 d\u00e9cembre 2017\n\nThe next phase in Madagascar\u2019s energy transition is diversification into renewables. The country has high hydro, solar, and wind potential as well as considerable biomass resources. Several projects are underway, including the construction of hydroelectric dams.\n\nThe aim in the next fifteen years is to boost the number of people with access to electricity in Madagascar to three quarters of the population.", "description": "Authorities want to upgrade energy production and distribution in Madagascar, where less than one in five people have access to electricity.", "authors": ["Hyacinthe Befeno Todimanana"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/413447/1000x563_413447.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-14"}
