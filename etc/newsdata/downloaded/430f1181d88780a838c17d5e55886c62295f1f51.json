Is physiological aging inevitable too? A growing cadre of biologists is starting to say no, thanks to developments in the field of epigenetics, which studies not our DNA itself but the processes that determine how our genes \u201cexpress\u201d themselves in directing our cells throughout our lives.\n\nIf you think of your inherited genetics, your DNA, as a piano keyboard, then epigenetics determines how the keys play music. The primary players in this concert...", "description": "Researchers in epigenetics are learning how to slow down\u2014and even turn back\u2014the clock that governs aging in our cells", "authors": ["David A.
