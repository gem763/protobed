And this same buoyancy is evident in the local market, with the S &P/ASX 200 index finishing last week within 2 per cent of its record high.\n\nBut while investors may be feeling confident, that doesn't mean they're prepared to pay the unrealistic prices that private equity sellers have demanded for the companies they were hoping to serve up to the local market.\n\nThese offerings included the proposed $3.2 billion IPO of Latitude Financial Group, which had been expected to be the local market's biggest float of the year. This attempted float was abandoned a fortnight ago by its co-owners, KKR (the world's biggest private equity firm), Deutsche Bank and Varde Partners in the face of anemic investor interest.\n\nBut this was not an isolated example. Last week, US-based private equity firm Bain Capital pulled the IPO of Retail Zoo.\n\nFund managers were decidedly unenthusiastic about the $300 million plus price tag that was being put on the food and beverage group, which equated to around 15 times the group's forecast profit.\n\nAnd the $1 billion sharemarket listing of PropertyGuru, was a further casualty last week. Plans for an IPO of the Asian online real estate classifieds group, which is backed by KKR, were ditched at the eleventh hour.\n\nEarlier this month, the proposed $500 million IPO of coal seam gas services business MPC Kinetic was pulled by its owners, SCF Partners and Viburnum Funds.\n\nThe most striking feature of this spate of failed IPOs was the obvious reluctance of private equity owners to admit that their price expectations were simply too high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough some were prepared to accept modest price reductions in an effort to get the deal done, there remained an unbridgeable gap between the unlisted valuation and what investors in the listed market were prepared to pay.\n\nSome of the country's most astute investors argue that the size of this gulf suggests that private equity firms have been living in an echo chamber when it comes to valuing high-growth firms.\n\nThey argue that huge growth in the size of the unlisted investment space means that it has become increasingly common for private equity firms to realise their investments by selling to other private equity firms, rather than by going through the traditional channel of a sharemarket listing.\n\nBut there's a danger that as private equity firms swap assets between themselves in the unlisted market, they'll increasingly convince themselves that high-growth firms deserve astronomic valuations.\n\nOf course, it suits private equity players to adopt this belief. Not only does it justify the often inflated prices they've paid to acquire stakes in private companies, it also results in a very flattering valuation of their existing stable of investments.\n\nSuch valuations won't be tested while the assets remain in the unlisted space. The risk, however, is that they'll be exposed as fanciful when an attempt is made to publicly list the company.\n\nIn turn, this raises the question of whether the double-digit returns that private equity firms have notched up in the past can be replicated in future. Especially if they've paid bullish prices for assets on the assumption that they can be flipped for an even higher price in future.", "description": "The spate of IPO flops suggests private equity firms are operating in an echo chamber, trading assets between themselves at inflated prices.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7811%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1ebdc7031c00410efa9c3fd2f10fa34eea05288a", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
