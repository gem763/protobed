Reports of interest from Alphabet sent shares up more than 30 per cent on Monday.\n\nA wearable tech company trying to ward off the existential threat of smartphones is not exactly a moonshot project for Alphabet, parent company of search engine Google.\n\nIt may be looking at consumer devices to be a new source of revenue growth, but an investment in Fitbit appears to clash with an existing interest in smartphones, shown by the recent release of a new Pixel device and a $US40 million ($58 million) investment in smartwatch technology from Fossil.\n\nFitbit makes most of its money selling devices but has had mixed success. Its shares trade far below the $US20 they listed at in 2015. If a deal does emerge, it may end up being more about data than devices. Fitbit devices track location and biometrics \u2014 both useful bits of information.\n\nIt has also been working on a services business, Fitbit Health Solutions, which includes functions such as coaching.\n\nThird-quarter earnings released on Monday show that Alphabet\u2019s advertising business sales grew 17 per cent on the previous year to almost $US34 billion. This is respectable but not enough to prevent a rise in costs from squeezing profit margins.", "description": "A deal with Fitbit could provide Google\u2019s parent company another platform for its ads business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1037%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_447/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b18737d790a2fde2adf9f44431e68c528995b08", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
