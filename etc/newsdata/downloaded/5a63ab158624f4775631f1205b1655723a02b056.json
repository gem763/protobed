They are expected to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erodo\u011fan, at 2.30pm local time (12.30pm BST/7.30am ET).\n\nTrump claims Kurds 'no angels' as he boasts of his own 'brilliant' strategy Read more\n\nOn Wednesday Trump hailed his decision to withdraw US troops in Syria, paving the way for the Turkish offensive, as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d, declaring that the Kurds he had abandoned were \u201cmuch safer now\u201d and were anyway \u201cnot angels\u201d.\n\nHis remarks not only undercut the mission to Ankara but contradicted the official assessment of both the state and defence departments that the Turkish offensive was a disaster for regional stability and the fight against Isis.\n\nIn two further extraordinary developments, a bizarre letter from Trump to Erdo\u011fan emerged in which the US president warned his Turkish counterpart \u201cdon\u2019t be a fool\u201d, and a White House meeting with Democratic lawmakers descended into mutual accusations of \u201cmeltdowns\u201d.\n\nThe letter, first published by Fox Business, was sent on 9 October \u2013 three days after a phone call in which Erdo\u011fan informed Trump of his plans, and understood the US president to give a green light. The US president issued a statement announcing the offensive was about to happen and that US troops would be moved out of the way. He also invited Erdo\u011fan to the White House.\n\nTrump wrote: \u201cHistory will look upon you favourably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The letter from Trump to Erdo\u011fan.

Kalin said that Ankara had told the US administration it would not stop the offensive, and would not negotiate with Kurdish forces.\n\nPompeo said he would be telling the Turkish president: \u201cHe needs to stop the incursion into Syria.\u201d\n\nHe told the Fox Business Network: \u201cWe need them to stand down, we need a ceasefire, at which point we can begin to put this all back together again.\u201d\n\nTrump had no words of criticism for Erdo\u011fan or the Turkish military on Wednesday, despite the fact the administration imposed sanctions on Monday, in an effort to force an end to the offensive. Those sanctions have been criticised as toothless by members of Congress, who are preparing their own sanctions package.\n\nTwo-thirds of House Republicans supported a resolution condemning his decision to withdraw troops from north-eastern Syria.\n\nThe vote triggered what the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, described as \u201ca meltdown\u201d by the president when she and other members of Congress visited him in the White House.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nancy Pelosi confronts Donald Trump in the White House on Wednesday.

He said the meeting \u201cwas not a dialogue, this was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts\u201d.\n\nPelosi said: \u201cI pray for the president all the time \u2026 I think now we have to pray for his health \u2013 this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d She added Democrats \u201ccouldn\u2019t continue in the meeting because he was just not relating to the reality of it\u201d.\n\nRepublicans argued it was Pelosi who would have been the problem.The White House spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, called Pelosi\u2019s action \u201cbaffling but not surprising\u201d.\n\nTrump pushed back in a series of tweets, describing Pelosi\u2019s intervention during the meeting as an \u201cunhinged meltdown\u201d.", "description": "Mike Pence heads to Ankara as US president contradicts official assessment on Turkish offensive", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b85d46a92eb20da51ac4f7d313fdf830b0c44da/437_196_1461_877/master/1461.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=296bdfb1d46e069a503d2b05ba0bd8b4", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
