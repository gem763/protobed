Baldwin posted an Instagram Story of the song she was listening to at the time, Summer Walker's \"I'll Kill You.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Dimitrios Kambouris - Getty Images More\n\nWalker's song is more or less a lyrical warning to other women not to come between her and her partner. Lyrics in that song include \"Don't want no problems, I wish a bitch would / Try to come between us, it won't end up good / You know I love you like no one else could / I'd go to Hell and back for ya.\"\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram More\n\nSo yes, it was easy for Selena Gomez fans to take that as a message to Gomez to back off Bieber, especially given Gomez's new single is a breakup song that seems partly inspired by her relationship with Bieber.\n\nHAILEY MARRIED THIS GUY TWO MONTHS AFTER HE TOOK SELENA TO HIS DAD\u2019S WEDDING AND NOW SHE IS PRESSED THAT SELENA RELEASED A SONG CLOSING THE CHAPTER...

Gomez and Bieber's break became a breakup in March/April 2018; Bieber started dating Baldwin in June and got engaged to her in July. Jailey was married in September 2018.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Hailey was listening to Summer Walker's song of that title, and Selena fans read very much into it.", "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Li2sJn0ex_Neq0zent2k2g--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/elle_570/993620f4974cf09d737eb63521421488", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
