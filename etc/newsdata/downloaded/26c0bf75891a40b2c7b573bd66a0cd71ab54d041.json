Subscribe\n\nIt\u2019s all about the consumer\n\nMonday brought the third quarter to an end.\n\nIt was a quarter that saw the Fed cut interest rates twice. The yield curve inverted for the first time in over a decade, signaling to some investors that recession is imminent. And Trump\u2019s trade war with China continued to weigh on sentiment across markets.\n\nWhen the dust settled, however, the S&P 500 and Dow both closed up better than 1% and within 2% of record highs.\n\nAnd a quick look at the stocks that lead the Dow higher during the quarter reveals investors betting on one key theme that indicates a belief this expansion will continue: the U.S. consumer.\n\nThe best performing stocks in the Dow during the third quarter were Procter & Gamble (PG), Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), and Home Depot (HD). Walmart (WMT) was the index\u2019s sixth-best performing stock, rising 7.4% against a 7.7% increase for Intel (INTC) shares.\n\nP&G rose 13.4% during the third quarter and finished Monday's session just pennies off its record high. Over the last year, P&G shares are up 50% making it the best performer in the Dow over that period by more than 20 percentage points. Apple stock gained 13.2% during the third quarter while Nike and Home Depot both gained more than 11.5%.\n\nAnd although each of these companies has their own unique story to tell the market, taken together this group is a clean cross-section of how investors have placed bets on the health of the U.S. consumer.\n\nWhat's the stock market doing? (Reuters) More\n\nP&G, for example, continues its turnaround after Nelson Peltz\u2019s activist campaign, which began nearly three years ago. In early September, Apple released one of its most exciting phone lineups in years. Home Depot is enjoying housing-related tailwinds from lower interest rates and homebuilding activity at a 12-year high. While both Nike and Walmart have been rewarded by investors for their investment in e-commerce while also mitigating impacts from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nBut the collective performance of these stocks reflects the market\u2019s view \u2014 expressed in part during September\u2019s rotation and the backup in Treasury yields \u2014 that a recession is not, in fact, imminent and that consumers will keep the expansion alive.\n\nAnd it was a fear of recession that gripped markets for much of the quarter, culminating in mid-August\u2019s yield curve inversion and the stock market\u2019s worst day of the year.\n\nNow as we\u2019ve highlighted in recent days, some economists have pointed to recent consumer confidence data as a sign the economy is in fact in a fragile state. And Friday\u2019s September jobs report will be a major check on the health of the U.S. labor market, as job gains are ultimately what supports the consumer spending being counted on to keep this expansion alive.\n\nBut the big picture story these share-price gains tell is that the consumer is still worth betting on.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
