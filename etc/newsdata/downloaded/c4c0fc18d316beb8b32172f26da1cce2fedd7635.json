But because she was deemed not to need a third bedroom, A's housing benefit was cut by 14%.\n\nShe applied for discretionary payments to plug the gap but today's ruling said this was not enough.\n\nLaunched by the Tory-Lib Dem Coalition in April 2013, the Bedroom Tax increases the rent people have to pay if they have \"extra\" rooms in their home.\n\nMinisters say it is designed to free up much-needed bigger homes. But critics have long complained there is a shortage of smaller flats for people to 'downsize' to - so they end up stuck where they are, paying higher rates.\n\nThe policy, officially called the \"removal of the spare room subsidy\", hits working-age people who live in social housing and claim housing benefit .\n\nUnder the scheme social housing tenants have 14% less net rent covered by housing benefit if they have a \"spare\" room. It leads to some victims having to find an extra \u00a31,560 a year.\n\nLawyer Ms Bevington said an estimated 281 households are in the same situation as A's.\n\nShe said: \"We now call on the Secretary of State to take swift action in response to today\u2019s ruling, and to change the rules to exempt from the bedroom tax the small but extremely vulnerable class of women and children who need the safety of a sanctuary scheme whilst they try to rebuild their lives after surviving domestic violence.\u201d\n\nToday's judgement did not find in favour of a second claimant who lives in a three-bed adapted home with her severely disabled daughter.\n\nThe claimant known as JD said her rights over private life and discrimination were breached after being charged more for the extra room.\n\nBut in this second case, the judges said discretionary payments to plug the gap were a \"proportional\" way to deal with her case.\n\nThe DWP has a three-month window to launch an appeal to the Grand Chamber of the ECHR if it chooses to.\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \u201cWe are carefully considering the judgement.\u201d", "description": "A rape and assault victim must now be paid \u00a38,600 in damages by the British government after a six-year fight over fees for her panic room", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty", "Afp"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article8511644.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Bedroom-Tax-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
