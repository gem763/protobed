I think it\u2019s a great job to do in such a giant club.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer\u2019s repeated talk about long-term forecasts has appeared in danger at times of ignoring more immediate perils and for Mourinho who, conscious of the impatience of the big clubs and with a thirst for instant success, has always focused on the here and now over the future, such a strategy might be considered at best a risk, at worst naive.\n\nBut while Mourinho invested his faith in experienced heads, often eschewing youth in the process, Solskjaer set his stall out quite clearly in the summer and is banking on a bunch of youngsters to buy him enough time to implement real change at Old Trafford. This was supposed to be the day when Solskjaer\u2019s bubble was well and truly punctured, the day his faith looked horribly misguided.", "description": "Jose Mourinho, up in the Sky Sports studio from where he would later be seen blowing kisses to the Stretford End who were chanting his name, could not resist a pre-match dig at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, his successor as Manchester United manager.", "authors": ["James Ducker", "Northern Football Correspondent", "Keith Hackett", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000213618213-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6W5U3i7aIsD-FFe7YFdv_qHyM6nv2oAAiNuWpQaAT3M.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
