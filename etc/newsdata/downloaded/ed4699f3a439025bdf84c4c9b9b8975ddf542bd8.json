He told his family how the host had really 'laid into' him and his brother and cousin are now appealing to get the correspondence between Dymond and the show's producers to be handed over for the inquest next month\n\nMembers of the Government's Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee (pictured) last month slammed the Kyle for his 'irresponsible' conduct on the show and it was axed following the death of Dymond\n\nHe took the test to prove to his girlfriend Jane Callaghan that he had not been unfaithful but was dumped after he failed it. Dymond was then found dead on May 9.\n\nKyle's programme was axed following the tragic death and growing pressure from politicians on its conduct.\n\nThe Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee then launched an inquiry into reality TV which Kyle refused to attend. Here MPs called the 56-year-old host 'irresponsible' and slammed the 'entire premise of the show [as] fake'.\n\nCarolyn McCall, ITV's chief executive, said it was 'the right time for the show to end' following the recent events in May. She added how the show had a 'loyal audience' and 'everyone at ITV's thoughts and sympathies' are with the family of Dymond, at the time.\n\nAnd Dymond's family now demand all correspondence between their loved one before and after appearing on the show, with the producers, is handed over ahead of the inquest into Dymond's death next month.\n\nThey could also demand to see emails as part of the Article 2 inquest - and it will be left up to the coroner to decide what is relevant.\n\nBut the family's appeal for legal aid to help get the evidence was rejected.\n\nThe family have appealed for legal aid to help get the documents from those involved in the programme's broadcast (pictured Jeremy Kyle during an episode) but have had this rejected. Leigh Day solicitors are representing Dymond's brother and cousin and fighting for the 'public interest'\n\nMerry Varney, solicitor for the family from solicitors Leigh Day who is representing the family, said it is 'disgraceful' that they are are having to 'fight' for legal help.\n\nThe firm represented Molly Russell's family for the inquest into the 14 year old girl's death in 2017.\n\nMolly took her life in 2017 after viewing content related to anxiety, depression and self-harm online.\n\nHere he is pictured with gilfriend Jane Callaghan who he initially went on to the show for\n\nVarney told the Mirror: 'As well as dealing [Dymond's family] with grief, we believe they have been subjected to flawed decision making by the Legal Aid Agency.'\n\nGiven the 'prevalence on reality television in today's society' and 'reported deaths linked to these kinds of programmes', Dymond's closest say there is a strong case for public interest, according to Varney.\n\nDymond's lawyers appealed against the refusal to give legal aid on September 16 but they have not received any response.\n\nMeanwhile Molly's family were initially denied legal aid in sourcing material from Instagram for the teenager's inquest because there was not sufficient 'wider public interest'.\n\nThe Legal Aid Agency then reconsidered their decision and full access to the online images were granted - in an attempt to establish whether they had played a part in Molly's death.\n\nITV have been approached by MailOnline for comment.\n\nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, or see samaritans.org for details", "description": "Steve Dymond's family are appealing for his calls with The Jeremy Kyle Show's producer's - for the article 2 inquest into his death next month.
