In the interview, he said performing on stage \"just never gets old.\"\n\n\"I never go on stage late,\" he said. \"I just love to get out there and I'm raring to go.\"\n\n\"Even when I was doing a lot of drugs, I still carried on playing music,\" he added. \"It's been my touchstone of my whole life.\"\n\nA highlight, John said, came in 1975 when John Lennon joined him to perform three songs at Madison Square Garden. It was Lennon's first appearance on stage in New York since the Beatles played Shea Stadium.\n\nLennon was so nervous that he vomited before the performance, John said. \"He came out to probably the most touching ovation I've ever heard,\" John said. \"We all shed a tear on stage.\"\n\nJohn said he is not sure what his future holds but he is still writing songs.\n\n\"I don't know what's next and I don't want to know what's next,\" he said. \"I'm just ready for the next chapter.\"\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "When Elton John was working on his new autobiography, the legendary singer, songwriter and performer pulled out diaries he had been encouraged to write during a stint in rehab.
