A trend can be seen among all the major exhibitions: the relevant point is no longer the size of the area, but the extent of the media reach,\u201d Mattes said.\n\nThe VDA said exhibition space had been cut from around 200,000 square meters in 2017, to around 168,000 this year and formats had been changed to include more interactive debates.\n\nThe number of exhibitors has shrunk to around 800 this year, from 994 in 2017. Fiat, Volvo, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Subaru, Chevrolet, Cadillac and Aston Martin will skip the show and only five exhibition halls will have new cars, instead of eight.\n\nThe Frankfurt show will, however, remain a key venue for German manufacturers to show off their wares.\n\nVolkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) will display its ID 3 electric vehicle, Porsche its Taycan electric sports car, and Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) its fully electric van.\n\nAll three carmakers are also hosting separate launch events for these vehicles outside of Frankfurt.", "description": "The Frankfurt Auto Show will champion sustainable driving and electric cars, Germany's auto industry association said on Monday, as it seeks to head off protests from climate activists.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
