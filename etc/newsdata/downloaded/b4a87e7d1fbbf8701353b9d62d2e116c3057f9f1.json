If you analyze it, more of the assets there are owned by the private sector \u2013 they\u2019re very tough on it,\u201d Dimon said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a better safety net than we do,\" he added. \"They take better care of their people. I think we could do that too. We should analyze our safety net, we should fix it, we should improve it, we should probably have a negative income tax, we should improve our cities, schools, infrastructure all these things. Social democracy is not socialism.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nCapitalism and wealth, whether corporate or individual, has come under fire from 2020 Democratic presidential contenders such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nWarren has said she wants to rein in Wall Street and break up big tech while Sanders has taken on the likes of corporate giants Walmart and Amazon.\n\nBoth candidates have called for health care for all and the forgiveness of student debt. Each would come at a hefty price tag. Health care for all would cost an additional $34 trillion over the first decade, according to the Urban Institute, a center-left leaning think tank.\n\nWarren\u2019s student debt plan would cancel student loans for millions of Americans while Sanders\u2019 would place the burden on Wall Street. Both plans would come at an enormous burden to taxpayers say, experts.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles", "description": "The straight-talking banking CEO is straightening out the true meaning of social policies.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
