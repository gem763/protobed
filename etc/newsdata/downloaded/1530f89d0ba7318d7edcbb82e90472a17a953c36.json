It\u2019s been an amazing week and I hope to come back in the future.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll definitely remember this moment for the rest of my life.\u2019\n\nShe has enjoyed a stunning year, having become the youngest player to qualify at Wimbledon in the Open Era before storming to the fourth round, while also reaching the third round in her home Slam at the US Open. One suspects this won\u2019t be her last professional title.\n\nOn the charcoal courts of Austria, the often streaky Ostapenko struggled to find her best form and Gauff accelerated into a one-set lead.\n\nCori Gauff\u2019s dad gave her a rousing speech (Picture: APA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Latvian surged back in the second, striking with power and purpose to level things up.\n\nIn the second game of the decider, the umpire overruled a linesperson who called a Gauff stroke, which caught the baseline, out and controversially decided that it was a late call, which didn\u2019t affect an Ostapenko backhand that sailed wide.\n\nThe decision saw Ostapenko broken and enraged, groaning: \u2018Can you see the ball? Are you sure?\u2019 She was handed a warning for her troubles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOstapenko\u2019s head dropped and so did her game, with Gauff seemingly en route to a comfortable victory as she stormed into a 5-0 lead.\n\nCori Gauff came through (Picture: APA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, two championship points came and went, with Ostapenko avoiding the bagel and the Latvian secured one of the breaks back as nerves took hold of the 15-year-old so close to the finish line.\n\nHer father was called to the court at the 5-2 changeover and told his daughter: \u2018We\u2019re not going to sprint to the finish line. We\u2019re going to walk to it. If you had 5-2 this time yesterday you\u2019d have taken it\u2019.\n\nTo the finish line, she did ultimately arrive, and she broke at the next time of asking to win a first WTA title.", "description": "Cori \"Coco\" Gauff's remarkable breakthrough season continued as she defeated former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in Linz, becoming the youngest WTA title winner in 15 years.
