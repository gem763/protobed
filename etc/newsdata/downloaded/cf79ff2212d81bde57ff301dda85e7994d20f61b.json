Ghosn, who led both companies and the Nissan-Renault alliance, is currently awaiting trial and denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe company said Bollor\u00e9 will be replaced on an interim basis by Chief Financial Officer Clotilde Delbos. Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard will become president during the interim period.\n\nAt a news conference to explain the decision to oust Bollor\u00e9, Senard said it was meant to \"breathe new life\" into the alliance with Nissan. He said it was made without pressure from the French government or Nissan.\n\n\"No one exerted pressure,\" he said.\n\nRenault owns 43% of Nissan but their alliance came under strain after Ghosn's jailing. Renault considered a merger offer from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles that would have created the world's third-largest automaker, but the talks fell apart due to concern over Nissan's role.\n\nBollor\u00e9 told French publication Les Echos ahead of the announcement that the board's move to oust him came as a surprise. He said he found out Senard wanted him gone from media reports after he flew back to Paris from Tokyo in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\n\"The brutality and the totally unexpected nature of what is about to happen is stupefying,\" he said, adding \"I was always loyal to him.\"\n\nResponding to a question about Renault's poor performance since he took the top post in January, he emphasized the strategic partnerships the company entered into with Google and Waymo under his watch.\n\n\"What is at stake is not me personally but the future of Renault and its 186,000 employees,\" he told Les Echos.\n\nLori Hinnant contributed to this report.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
