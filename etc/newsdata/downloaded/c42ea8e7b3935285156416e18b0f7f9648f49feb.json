Finally, the price formed a support base above $180 and later managed to climb higher. It surpassed the $185 resistance area to start the current recovery. Moreover, there was a close above the $185 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nDuring the rise, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $183 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair tested the $188 area and it is currently correcting gains. At the moment, the price is trading below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $180 swing low to $188 high. On the downside, there is a strong support forming near the $185 level (the previous resistance).\n\nMoreover, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $180 swing low to $188 high is also positioned near the $185 level. The next key support is near the $184 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. If there is a downside break and close below the $184 support area, Ethereum price could move back into a bearish zone. In the mentioned case, the price is likely to revisit the $178 support.\n\nOn the upside, the $188 level is an initial hurdle for the bulls. A successful break above the $188 level could push the price towards the $192 resistance. Any further upsides may perhaps call for a push towards the $195 resistance area.\n\nLooking at the chart, Ethereum price is showing positive signs above the $185 level, while bitcoin is still facing a strong resistance near $8,400. As long as ETH is above $184, there are chances of more gains in the near term. The bulls are likely to target $192 or $195. Conversely, the price could revisit $178 if it breaks $184.\n\nETH Technical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for ETH/USD is slowly moving into the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI \u2013 The RSI for ETH/USD is currently correcting lower towards the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Level \u2013 $184\n\nMajor Resistance Level \u2013 $192", "description": "Ethereum price is showing positive signs versus the US Dollar and bitcoin.
