It's Not the First Time.", "language": "en", "text": "A mob of about 50 far-right radicals attacked a Jewish community center in Budapest, Hungary on Wednesday, tearing down and burning a rainbow flag before covering the building with neo-fascist slogans.\n\nThe Aurora community center was closed when it was targeted by members of the ultranationalist Legio Hungaria group, and no one was hurt, according to Adam Sch\u00f6nberger, director of Marom Budapest, the Jewish youth group that runs the center.\n\nBut the incident was just the latest in a series of far-right stunts targeting Aurora, which receives funding from George Soros\u2019 Open Society Foundations and acts as a hub for NGOs representing minority groups, including the LGBTQ community, Roma and refugees.\n\nLast month about a dozen radicals they threw a dead rat into the building during an LGBTQ event and then loitered outside harassing people, Csaba Csontos, spokesman for Open Society Foundations, told VICE News.\n\nCsontos said he believed the Hungarian government\u2019s smear campaign against Soros and his philanthropic work had helped pave the way for the far-right attacks on the center.\n\n\u201cThese groups felt authorized to act, partly because the place was so stigmatized,\u201d he said.\n\nSince 2015, Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister Viktor Orban has demonized the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist as a public enemy. Orban used extensive propaganda campaigns drawing on anti-Semitic tropes to paint Soros as a shadowy, globalist mastermind intent on undermining the Hungarian leader\u2019s conservative brand of so-called \u201cilliberal democracy.\u201d\n\nREAD: How Hungary helped make George Soros the ultimate villain to nationalists\n\nCsontos said the Aurora center, which includes a bar, concert stage, and offices for civil society groups, had been routinely criticized in government-controlled media as a \u201cheadquarters\u201d for the Soros movement, while local authorities, until recently controlled by Orban\u2019s Fidesz party, had repeatedly tried to close the center.\n\n\u201cThis place is an ideal target for government propaganda,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems this triggered the far-right actions.\u201d\n\nIn March 2017, members of far-right group the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement filmed themselves spray painting \"Stop Operation Soros\" on the center\u2019s walls and surrounding pavements.\n\nThe center was targeted on Wednesday by members of Legio Hungaria as its members gathered in central Budapest for a nationalist march to commemorate the 1956 uprising against Soviet occupation.\n\nOn the group\u2019s website, on which it describes itself as \u201cextreme right,\u201d Legio Hungaria said that Wednesday\u2019s march was a \u201ctribute to our predecessors, who fought against the oppressive red terror \u2026 and a protest against the continued spread of new leftist ideas.\u201d\n\n\n\nCsontos said the group\u2019s attack appeared motivated by a mix of anti-Semitic, homophobic and anti-Soros prejudice, and seemed calculated to grab attention and announce its arrival on the far-right scene.\n\nThe Hungarian government did not respond to VICE News\u2019 requests for comment on allegations their anti-Soros campaign had helped embolden extremists to target the Aurora center.\n\nHungary\u2019s campaign against Soros \u2014 which have included restrictions on a Soros-funded private university, and a \u201cStop Soros\u201d law criminalizing NGOs deemed to be supporting illegal immigration \u2014 forced the Open Society Foundations to close its Budapest office last year and relocate to Berlin. Open Society has provided funding to Aurora since it was founded in 2014, with the goal of creating a space for civil society in an increasingly illiberal country.\n\nREAD: Hungary finally drove out George Soros\u2019 charity\n\nCover: Screenshot of Aurora community center from Google street view.", "description": "The mob burned a rainbow flag and covered the building with fascist slogans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db1ca3f9e16fc008c1ce79c/lede/1571933327545-Aurora.png?crop=0.8481xw:0.9988xh;0.1237xw,0.0012xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
