Trump\u2019s administration sought to avoid shuttering parks, as was done during a 2013 shutdown during President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, even though critics warned that leaving them open placed visitors and unguarded natural resources at risk.\n\nThe GAO said the Interior Department\u2019s moves to keep parks open violated the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which allows parks to charge visitor fees primarily for improvements, and the Antideficiency Act, which places constraints on federal spending.\n\nTo have kept parks open legally, the Interior Department would have had to use funds that had been appropriated by Congress, the GAO said.\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images A sign at Joshua Tree National Park on Jan. 4, 2019, in Joshua Tree National Park, California during the government shutdown.\n\nAn Interior spokesperson criticized the GAO report, saying the watchdog \u201creached their conclusion prematurely and without regard for all of the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe completely disagree with the GAO\u2019s erroneous opinion regarding our appropriate and lawful use of\u201d park fees, the spokesperson said. \u201cThe Department acted well within its legal authority to clean up restrooms and pick up trash, so the American people could enjoy their National Parks.\u201d\n\nWithin days of the Trump shutdown, park furloughs led to piles of garbage and human waste, raising health concerns.\n\nTwo weeks into the shutdown, National Park Service Deputy Director Daniel Smith said spending entrance fees was an \u201cextraordinary step to ensure that parks are protected, and that visitors can continue to access parks with limited basic services.\u201d", "description": "The Department of Interior broke the law by raiding park entrance fees, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d725f392300003200511bf1.jpeg?cache=1deykqkqr5&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
