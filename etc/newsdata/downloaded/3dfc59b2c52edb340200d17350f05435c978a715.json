The agreement is meant to provide a brief economic reprieve for both nations as they seek out a broader deal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has been quick to boast about scoring a major victory for \"great patriot farmers & ranchers.\" The president tweeted that a \"Phase One\" deal with China can be \"finalized & signed soon!\" during a potential November meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nBut Washington and Wall Street are reacting with caution to the announcement, following signals from Beijing that it still needs time to finalize the terms and amid criticism that the limited agreement does not touch on many of Trump's top priorities for a broader trade deal.\n\nThe Hill's Niv Elis and I will have more tomorrow in the print edition of The Hill and at TheHill.com.\n\nRead more: China reportedly wants more talks to hammer out details on a trade deal promoted by President Trump before it is signed by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

'I have every expectation if there's not a deal those tariffs would go in place, but I expect we'll have a deal,' Mnuchin said on CNBC's 'Squawk Box.'\"\n\nRead more: Chinese exports to the U.S., China's largest foreign market, decreased by 21.9 percent to $36.5 billion in September, The Associated Press reported Monday, citing customs data\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nTrump to impose sanctions on Turkey for military offensive in Syria: President Trump on Monday said he would soon implement sanctions on Turkey following bipartisan backlash over his decision to greenlight the country's incursion into northern Syria.\n\nThe president said in a statement that the U.S. will target government officials in Ankara and \"any persons contributing to Turkey's destabilizing actions in northeast Syria.\" The sanctions include an increase of steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent and a halt in trade negotiations with Ankara.\n\nThe order leaves open the possibility of the Trump administration imposing additional sanctions on Turkey depending on its actions in Syria moving forward.\n\n\"Turkey's military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\" Trump said in a statement. \"I have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey's action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes.\"\n\nThe Hill's Brett Samuels tells us more about the sanctions and what prompted them here.\n\nWhat to know about the crisis in Turkey:\n\nTurkish forces last week moved into northern Syria, attacking the Kurdish forces that fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS. Disturbing images and video footage of women and children being killed amid the fighting circulated on social media over the weekend.\n\nLawmakers and former military officials have asserted that Trump's decision to pull U.S. forces out of the region essentially gave Turkey a green light to move forward with its operation.\n\nIn an effort to turn back the Turkish offensive, the Kurds struck a deal to join Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. The two had previously been on opposing sides of a bloody civil war, and Assad is backed by Russia.\n\nWhat's next: President Trump on Monday called on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to negotiate a ceasefire with Kurdish forces amid violence in the region precipitated by a U.S. withdrawal from northern Syria.\n\nVice President Pence told reporters outside the White House that Trump \"pressed [Erdogan] very strongly\" to broker a ceasefire immediately. Pence will lead a delegation to Turkey in the coming days to help broker a settlement between Ankara and Kurdish forces, he added.\n\nBrett has more on this breaking development here.\n\nMeanwhile in Congress: Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden on impeachment: 'I'm the only reason' it's happening Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Rand Paul calls for probe of Democrats over Ukraine letter MORE (D-Calif.) said on Monday that she and Sen. Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamFurious Republicans prepare to rebuke Trump on Syria Democrats to offer resolution demanding Trump reverse Syria decision Army officer calls Syria pullback 'a stain on the American conscience' MORE (R-S.C.) agreed on the need for a resolution overturning President Trump's decision on Syria, as well as additional sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\"Pleased to have a conversation with Senator @LindseyGrahamSC this morning. Our first order of business was to agree that we must have a bipartisan, bicameral joint resolution to overturn the President's dangerous decision in Syria immediately,\" Pelosi said in a series of tweets.\n\nReadouts from both Pelosi and Graham did not mention a deal on specific legislation, but centered on a broader agreement that additional sanctions were needed.\n\nMore from The Hill's Jordain Carney here.\n\nSanders proposes sharp hike to corporate taxes in 'accountability' plan: Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSanders wishes Ocasio-Cortez happy birthday Video of fake Trump shooting members of media shown at his Miami resort: report Sanders can gain ground by zeroing in on corruption MORE (I-Vt.) on Monday unveiled an economic plan that includes sharply increasing the corporate tax rate and eliminating most corporate tax breaks and loopholes.\n\nThe \"Corporate Accountability and Democracy Plan\" would increase the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 35 percent, its level before the 2017 tax-cut law, while targeting tax breaks, loopholes and offshore tax havens.\n\nThe plan would also require companies that are publicly traded or have at least $100 million in annual revenue or at least $100 million on their balance sheet total to give workers 2 percent of the company's stock until employees own at least 20 percent of the company.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nThree economists were awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics for their research into global poverty.\n\nPresident Trump and lawmakers in both parties have focused their ire on the NBA, not China, amid last week's spat over Hong Kong protesters and freedom of speech, boosting pressure on the league to defy Beijing's attempts to stifle criticism.", "description": "Happy Monday and welcome back to On The Money.
