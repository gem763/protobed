The search giant announced a handful of new devices, including brand-new Pixel Buds, the mighty Pixel 4 smartphone, and an updated Nest Mini.\n\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to fly out to New York for the event, I did tune in via Google\u2019s livestream. Here are all the important announcements you missed if you weren\u2019t able to watch.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nRick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, kicked off the event, and he talked a bit about how great it would be / great it is when you have all sorts of devices intermingling in your house to help you out throughout your day. That includes Stadia, Google\u2019s cloud-gaming platform, which will now officially launch in the U.S. on November 19. Announcement number one!\n\nEditor's Note: An official Australian launch has not yet been announced for Google Stadia.\n\nPixel Buds\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nGoogle teased new earbuds that it\u2019s planning to launch in the spring of 2020 for $US179 ($265). Specs include five hours of battery life on their own and 24 hours of battery life when you\u2019re using a supplemental wireless charging case. They\u2019ll fit nearly flush with your ear and use a hybrid design to seal your ear (for better bass) and a bottom-facing spatial vent to let in exterior sound.\n\nYour Pixel Buds\u2019 volume will automatically adjust depending on the loudness of your exterior condition, and beamforming microphones allow people to hear you easier when you\u2019re chatting.\n\nEditor's Note: Pricing and availability for Australia was not confirmed.\n\nPixelbook Go\n\nThis $US649 ($961), 13mm-thin Chrome OS laptop gives you 12 hours of battery life and weighs a mere two pounds. It comes with \u201cultra-quiet hush keys\u201d that are allegedly quieter than anything you\u2019ve ever seen on a Google laptop, and the specs aren\u2019t too shabby for a Chrome OS laptop:\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nEditor's Note: The Pixelbook line has not previously been available in Australia, and given that Australian pricing and availability was not provided for the new model, it can be assumed the Pixelbook Go is not coming to our shores.\n\nNest Mini\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nAvailable on October 29 for $79, the Nest Mini is arriving with a brand-new \u201cSky\u201d colour option and a new wall-mount design for all. According to Google, the Nest Mini has twice as powerful of a bass as the Home Mini, more \u201cclear and natural sound,\u201d and comes with a third microphone to help hear you better.\n\nNest Mini also has a dedicated machine-learning chip with 1 TeraOPS of computing power. This means processing can run locally on your device, rather than processing in a Google data centre.\n\nNest Wifi\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nSay hello to \u201cNest Wifi.\u201d You get a router that plugs into your cable modem, and a \u201cwifi point\u201d to expand your coverage with a new bubble of Wi-Fi around your home. Google claims an improvement of 25 per cent of coverage and twice the speed of Google Wifi \u2014 I believe that means processing speed, not wireless speeds, for what it\u2019s worth. (The router itself is a 4x4 MU-MIMO device, likely overkill for most people\u2019s needs, and the supplemental access point is a 2X2 MU-MIMO AC1200 device.)\n\nThe Nest Wifi also comes with a built-in Google Assistant speaker, so you can just buy one of these instead of buying a Wi-Fi router and a smart speaker. Not bad. You\u2019ll be able to preorder it today, pick one up starting November 5, and the two-pack starts at $399. (The three-pack costs $549.)\n\nPixel 4\n\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ve been waiting for. Google finally unveiled its latest smartphone, and here\u2019s a quick look at some of the fun that\u2019s packed inside. First, though, the raw details: It\u2019ll hit on October 24 for $1,049 ($1,279 for the XL). You can preorder it today.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nNow, to the details. The Pixel 4 comes with a radar sensor built-in, which allegedly gives you super-fast facial detection for phone unlocking \u2014 \u201dMotion Sense,\u201d as Google calls it, which also allows gives you the ability to quickly control your device using gestures. (This is pretty neat.) Also, anything you do with Motion Sense is stored locally on your device and isn\u2019t shared with any other Google services.\n\nGoogle also announced that it\u2019s pulling in more Google Assistant processing onto the Pixel 4 itself, which should speed up the call-and-response between you and the Assistant (versus having to process your commands at a Google data centre all the time, that is.)\n\nA new \u201cRecorder\u201d app on the Pixel 4 will allow you to have a super-convenient transcription of whatever it is you\u2019re hearing in real-time \u2014 great for lectures and meetings, for sure. Finding specific recordings by searching for words and phrases is simple, and every instance of that word or phrase is highlighted on your recording\u2019s timeline for extra convenience. As a journalist, I love this feature, and would use it frequently.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThe Pixel 4 comes with an OLED display and a 90Hz refresh rate. The refresh rate will automatically adjust based on what you\u2019re doing, to reduce how much battery you\u2019re burning when you don\u2019t need that much firepower.\n\nAs for the Pixel 4's photographic features, you get rear, wide, and telephoto cameras, as well as a \u201chyperspectral sensor\u201d and a microphone. To Google, however, the camera specs don\u2019t seem to be nearly as important as the software that helps power the entire process.\n\nFor example, Google is using a hybrid of optical and digital zoom to increased the clarity of your image when you\u2019re zooming in. In fact, Google recommends zooming instead of just shooting a big, faraway shot and cropping \u2014 the more you know.\n\nGoogle also announced four other interesting computational photography features for the Pixel 4 at the event:", "description": "Happy Google day!
