Those are the sorts of things that, however hard to quantify or sometimes even identify, usually get laid at the feet of a manager. The groundwork for all of that was laid out pretty starkly last offseason too, Rosenthal notes, when the Cubs front office spoke to players who told them that they thought Maddon and the coaching staff was too hands-off.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNot that that\u2019s the whole story, of course. Maddon has always been generally the same guy. He didn\u2019t forget how to manage. The players didn\u2019t always execute. The front office has not developed talent particularly well in recent years. Success has many fathers but, contrary to the old saying, so too does failure. No one has distinguished themselves all that much in Chicago in the past year or so. Only one person\u2019s contract is up, however, and that\u2019s Joe Maddon.", "description": "He is about to manage his final three games for the Cubs, it seems", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/euIe1xvmb6G1WukQ_z3DyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pdbIaq.NZmerQKGDSEHgAg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/aa35287434ca52dcf931d636b6f1d622", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
