Maybe more staggering was the distance of his 3-point makes in the quarter, including four of 30-plus feet and an average distance of 29.1 feet on the eight makes.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nEdwards nearly matched Klay Thompson's regular-season record of nine 3-pointers in a quarter. He did match Boston's regular-season record of nine 3-pointers in a game, a feat accomplished by both Isaiah Thomas and Antoine Walker.\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens was present for Thomas' outburst and Edwards' offensive explosion still left him searching for the right words.\n\n\"I don't know if I've ever seen anything like that,\" Stevens told reporters in Cleveland. \"Those were deep, hard 3s. And how many? Eight? In like five minutes? I've never seen anything like that. I don't know that I have any reference points. He was pretty special.\"\n\nFor his part, Edward shrugged off his part. He credited his teammates with finding him open shots. He suggested that he slipped into a similar shooting zone against top-seeded Virginia during the NCAA Tournament (that day, Edwards scored 42 points on 14-of-25 shooting with ten 3-pointers as Purdue nearly produced the upset).\n\nWhat Stevens liked best was how Edwards, who took a hard shot to the nose in the opening minutes of the game, shook off an uneven first half to erupt in the second.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I think the most encouraging part of the whole performance was I didn't think he was very good in the first half. And for him to be able to recenter and play and come out of the gates like that in the second, that's a great thing for a coach to learn about somebody,\" Stevens told reporters. \"Sometimes guys don't have it on a given night ... but you always know that he's probably one time from hitting the net away from getting hot.\n\n\"He lives on heat checks.\"\n\nThe bigger picture here for the Celtics is that, in summer league and the preseason, Edwards has shown that his scoring skills should translate to the NBA. He might just be the microwave bench scoring option that the team has long coveted in the Stevens era.\n\nIt's fair to want to see it in regular-season play. But it would also seem logical that Edwards might see even easier shots if he's got talents such as Jayson Tatum or Gordon Hayward on the court and opposing teams can't send their best defenders at him.\n\nNot that it would deter him, anyhow. In the preseason, 31 of Edwards' 43 field goal attempts came beyond the arc. He shot 45.2 percent from 3-point land and 51.2 percent overall. He scored 61 points in 73 minutes and the Celtics had an offensive rating of 112.6 when he was on the court.\n\nEdwards' usage percentage was 28.8 percent this preseason, a number driven slightly higher by his six turnovers. Still, he accounted for a staggering 34.1 percent of Boston's points in his floor time.\n\nThis suggests that he won't be particularly bashful when Stevens puts him into regular-season games. There's backup guard minutes to be had with the departure of Terry Rozier and Edwards will get plenty of reps if he shoots like he has since arriving in Boston.\n\nIt's a good sign for Boston if players like Waters need a bit of zinc oxide to combat any burns they get from being too close to Edwards moving forward.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
