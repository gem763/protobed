Often, the first step is deciding on a cloud strategy.\n\n\"Every business is a digital business. And frankly, every digital business is in the cloud,\" Adam Burden, the chief software engineer at the consulting firm Accenture, told Business Insider. As Accenture's clients are transforming, \"they're finding the cloud is really an essential ingredient of making that transition.\"\n\nIncreasingly, firms are opting for a hybrid model, where some of their information is stored on a public cloud \u2014 like Amazon Web Services \u2014 while other data is held privately in on-premises clouds. But it can be a difficult decision to make, and one that can have sizeable business impacts in the years to come.\n\nMost, however, just need to get started, according to Burden. At Accenture, he oversees more than 35,000 software engineers across the globe. Burden shared the four tips the company provides clients who are starting their cloud journey.\n\nDon't over analyze. Just get started.\n\nSpending too much time debating issues like which information to transfer first can put companies in \"analysis paralysis,\" according to Burden.\n\n\"It's actually important just to get started,\" he said. \"Don't over analyze.\"\n\nThe hesitancy to move is a common problem as companies consider how to pursue a digital upgrade. Often, organizations think they don't have the budget to migrate to the cloud or store data for artificial-intelligence-based applications.\n\nThere is some justification for those concerns. While competition in the cloud industry between Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and others has driven down costs, executives are still surprised by the price. But that's not always the case for tech upgrades. A subscription to Watson Studio, IBM's data-science platform, for example, costs only $5,000 a month.\n\nFind 'no-regret' moves to begin with, then move to bigger projects.\n\nAlongside the hesitancy to get started, companies often have difficulty figuring out exactly which information to move to the cloud initially, Burden said.\n\nOrganizations shouldn't seek to move all of their data at once. Instead, Burden suggests picking what he refers to as a \"no-regret\" move, or one that comes with relatively low risk. \"It can be a great proving ground for identifying whether there's some compatibility problems with your systems as you begin to move them,\" he said.\n\nTwo areas that typically work for all organizations are the customer-relationship-management and human-resources systems. There's a litany of cloud-based platforms, like Workday and Salesforce, that can replace the on-premises applications and begin to offer the next-generation capabilities the tech promises.\n\nTaking a hard look at those products and \"comparing them to some of their on-premises capabilities, that can be a really important place to start as well and can actually release some early benefits,\" Burden said.\n\nTake the opportunity to review your application portfolio\n\nOn average, most companies have 800 applications across the enterprise, whether those are tools to help manage customer-service complaints or platforms for accounting and billing, according to Burden. That number can rise as high as 15,000.\n\nThe transfer to the cloud presents a good opportunity for organizations to review their application portfolio to determine duplication or whether some products are no longer in use.\n\n\"They have a lot of redundancy in their portfolio. Often, they also have a lot of applications that they keep around for regulatory purposes or just for reporting purposes. Even though they're largely deprecated, they could actually retire them if they had a place to actually move them,\" Burden said.\n\nIt's not always feasible, however. Some businesses, for example, need to quickly move out of data centers, because a lease is ending or storage is running out, and don't have time to conduct the analysis.\n\nAnd even doing the review doesn't mean companies will be able to remove all of their applications that are no longer widely used. \"Sometimes it can be more expensive to retire them than to keep them running,\" Burden said.\n\nMeasure what matters, not just the economic results\n\nExecutives and board members always want to see a financial return from investments like the shift to cloud, but companies should look to other metrics aside from economic impact, Burden said.\n\nAmong the \"softer benefits\" he says organizations should consider is the time that cloud can save. In the past, it could take business units months to procure a data server to advance a project. Now, with the cloud, it takes \"a matter of seconds,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a hard dollar benefit like some of the others, but it's a real benefit,\" Burden said.\n\nThe move to cloud is an important foundational piece for companies that are eager to pursue more advanced AI or machine-learning-based applications. The tips from Burden can serve as a road map for those executives who are beginning to craft their own cloud strategy.", "description": "Most companies need to get started on their journey to cloud, Accenture's Adam Burden said.
