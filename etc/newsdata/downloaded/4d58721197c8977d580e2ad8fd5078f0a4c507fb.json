Pavements were scattered with the glass of several smashed shop-fronts and billboards had been torn down.\n\nProtesters blocked roads in the north, the south and the Bekaa Valley, among other areas on Friday, the National News Agency (NNA) reported. Schools were closed on the instructions of the government.\n\n'We are one people united against the state. We want it to fall,' a protester in the town of Jeita said.

Sectarian politicians, many of them civil war veterans, have long used state resources for their own political benefit and are reluctant to cede prerogatives.\n\nThe crisis has been compounded by a slowdown in capital flows to Lebanon, which has long depended on remittances from its diaspora to meet financing needs, including the state's deficit.\n\nThe financial crunch has added to the impetus for reform but the government's steps have yet to convince foreign donors who have offered billions in financial assistance conditional on changes.\n\nThe strains have emerged recently in the real economy where importers have been unable to secure dollars at the pegged exchange rate.\n\nThe cabinet is due to meet on Friday at the presidential palace in Baabda in what a minister has said would be the final session to discuss the 2020 state budget.", "description": "Violent protests have broken out across Lebanon after the government announced a new 20 cents per day tax on voice calls via internet in the midst of an economic crisis.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/11/19878210-0-image-a-9_1571393243458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
