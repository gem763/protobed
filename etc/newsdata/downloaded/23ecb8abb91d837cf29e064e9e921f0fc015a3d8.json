One of the more popular and simple ways to do this is by selling thrifted or secondhand clothing online.\n\nBetween my marketing experience and binge-watching Netflix\u2019s \u2018Girlboss\u2019, I decided to start an online thrift store of my own.\n\nREAD MORE: We asked 3 local fashion bosses for OOTD inspiration\n\nHere\u2019s are ten things that I learnt:\n\n1 - The marketing mix is always a good place to start\n\nThe \u2018marketing mix\u2019 refers to the business model for establishing a basic business plan. It consists of the \u20184 Ps\u2019: product; price; place, promotion. This should be your first step.\n\nProduct: Quite obviously, what you are selling (clothing, accessories, shoes, books, etc.).\n\nPrice: The markup on your goods is entirely up to you, but remember that thrifted/secondhand items are meant to be affordable.\n\nPlace: In this case, online with the platform being Instagram.\n\nPromotion: Your method of promoting your business (Instagram ads, word-of-mouth, influencers, a good-ol\u2019 fashion poster, etc.). Naturally, online ads work best for an online store.\n\nREAD MORE: ThickLeeyonce on diversity in the fashion and beauty industry - 'I'm often the only big black girl on set'\n\n2 - Know your target market\n\n\n\nThe only way you can accurately market and sell your goods is by knowing who you are selling to (demographics), the location of your customers (geographics) and the interests, feelings and preferences of your target audience (psychographics). For example, your target market could be women aged 18-30 who live in Johannesburg and like \u201870s-inspired clothing.\n\n3 - Find your unique selling point (USP)\n\n\n\nYour USP is what differentiates you from others. This is something every successful business has. Whether it be your product offering or simply making your business stand out with a fun logo or interesting content - do that. This creates a position for your brand in the market, which refers to how consumers see your business in relation to your competitors. Always make your position a positive and exciting one.\n\n4 - Establish your distribution channel\n\nWhether it\u2019s delivery, collection or using courier services, you need to make sure you\u2019ve got a distribution plan on-lock before starting your business. I personally find PAXI to be the most convenient and affordable for its geographic range.\n\n5 - Some basic SEO is the way to go\n\nIn order for more people to find out about your business, you have to do some SEO (Search Engine Optimisation). This includes using \u2018keywords\u2019 in your business name and bio consider using words such as thrift, clothing, thrift South Africa.\n\nHashtag your keywords on your posts as well to get a greater reach.\n\nCreate your own unique hashtag such as #ThriftBy(whatever your store name is) and ask customers to use it when sharing images of your clothing. That way, more people learn about your store and you get to show off your happy customers!\n\nInstagram business tools is your friend as it provides you with the best insights and allow you to filter your promotions to reach your specific target market.\n\nREAD MORE: Why you should stop buying new clothes\n\n6 - Develop your Ts & Cs\n\nMake sure your returns, refund, payment, clothing reserving policy etc. is established and stated clearly on your page from the get-go to refer back to should any customer issues arise.\n\n7 - Good product images are key\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to selling clothing, people are more likely to buy things once they see how they look on someone else as opposed to simply a picture of the item itself. You\u2019re also able to style the items in many different ways to show the potential they have. Save money and model them yourself with the help of your trusty self-timer option. If the clothes don\u2019t fit you, consider asking a friend for help.\n\n8 - Stock variety\n\n\n\nWhen sourcing clothing to sell, it can be easy to look at things through your own style lens. I\u2019ve found that sometimes the things I think would never sell end up being a hit. So if you\u2019re skeptical about posting something, do it anyway- you never know who may be interested. Try to stock clothing as close to the current season as possible. Inclusivity is definitely key as well, so stock as many different sizes as possible.\n\nREAD MORE: Fitfluencers to follow for inspiration\n\n9 - Good customer service is vital\n\nMake your online space a good one for new and existing customers. Be polite and respond to queries as soon as you can. Make sure customers receive their products and ask for feedback. Communication is always key!\n\n10 - Be consistent\n\nWith online thrift stores being a relatively saturated market, it may take a little while before you sell anything - don\u2019t let that discourage you. Showing your consistency will make customers regard you as a trustworthy brand, so definitely keep at it. Not everything in life is going to be an instant hit.\n\nDo you own an innovative or disruptive business?
