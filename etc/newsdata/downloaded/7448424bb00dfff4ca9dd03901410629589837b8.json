But now, as reports of the chaotic, alcohol-fueled culture at WeWork proliferate, employees are getting nervous that the experience could actually count against them as they look for new jobs, an executive told Reeves Wiedeman at New York magazine\u2019s Intelligencer.\n\nNeumann presided over a company in which mandatory parties, nepotism, and over-the-top behavior flourished, according to an in-depth Business Insider report published on Sunday. Now the office-sharing company is trying to rehabilitate its image and impose financial discipline to staunch its financial losses.\n\n\u201cThousands of people who worked tirelessly, because there\u2019s no other way to do it there, are going to end up screwed financially because they took lower income to have more equity that has disintegrated,\u201d one executive told Intelligencer. Several employees reported using their savings to buy stock options, which could leave them financially ruined, according to Intelligencer. Before leaving, Neumann had already cashed out more than $700 million of the company\u2019s stock, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.\n\nRead more: Sex, Tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann\u2019s WeWork talk about the nonstop partying to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nOn September 24, the day Neumann was ousted from WeWork, the new co-CEOs sent a company-wide memo announcing their new roles in the company, Intelligencer reported.\n\nAccording to the Intelligencer report, WeWork employees were divided about new co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham. Some were ready for a post-Neumann WeWork, but many wondered why the executives hadn\u2019t done more to keep Neumann in check. Minson, a former Time Warner executive, joined WeWork in 2015. Neumann once referred to him as the \u201cadult in the room.\u201d Gunningham was the vice chairman of WeWork before taking on the new role.\n\nIntelligencer reported that the most used reactions to the news on Slack were the WeWork logo and the \u201cneutral-face,\u201d \u201copen-mouth,\u201d and \u201cupside-down-face\u201d emoji. The co-CEOs said on a conference call with the entire company they would act transparently and that this was just the beginning.\n\nRead more: How WeWork spiraled from a $47 billion valuation to talk of bankruptcy in just 6 weeks\n\nOn a call with senior employees the next day, Gunningham warned anyone not on board with a potentially difficult transition that they \u201cshould probably consider getting out,\u201d Intelligencer reported.\n\nThe WeWork employee concerns about their work experience echo those of Uber employees at the height of its controversies a couple of years ago.
