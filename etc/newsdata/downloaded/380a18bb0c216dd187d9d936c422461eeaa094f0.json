The image of the star safety making an obscene gesture toward his own bench while being carted off the field is one of the most indelible from the 2018 season, and Thomas was not shy about his displeasure with the franchise.\n\nKnowing that, the Ravens were extra focused on getting Thomas a big win in Seattle on Sunday, something they accomplished with a hard-fought 30-16 victory.\n\nDuring the game, there were a couple of moments in which Thomas appeared to be jawing with the Seahawks bench. Media members pointed out his antics at a few key points in the game.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat was ruled a fumble and Earl Thomas was yelling at Pete Carroll on the sideline. Carroll wasn't listening but Bobby Wagner stepped in front of Thomas and pushed him toward Ravens sideline. \u2014 Jeff Zrebiec (@jeffzrebiec) October 20, 2019\n\nAfter the game was won, Thomas was happy and cordial with a few of his longtime teammates. He shared a long embrace with the new face of the Seahawks defense in Bobby Wagner, and then made a beeline to swap jerseys with Russell Wilson.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat you may have noticed is who Thomas *didn't* embrace, shake hands with or even talk to. On his way from Wagner to Wilson, Thomas notably brushes right past his former head coach, Pete Carroll.\n\nCarroll makes no effort to stop Thomas, and Thomas makes no effort to stop Carroll. It's possible the two just didn't notice each other, but given their long history and the relevance of that storyline, it's hard to imagine them completely missing each other.\n\nIt appears Thomas was happy to ignore his longtime coach, and his coach was happy to oblige.\n\nThomas is a highly competitive player, and a big win keyed by his new defense in his old stomping grounds had to feel good. But the postgame handshakes, and lack thereof, show that the hatchet may not be completely buried just yet.\n\nMORE RAVENS NEWS:\n\nEarl Thomas appears to ignore former head coach in first return to Seattle originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington", "description": "The star safety spent nine years winning a lot of games in Seattle, but was very unhappy at the time of his departure last season.", "authors": ["Ryan Wormeli"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ub26ESnFwTTi3IGJ9TLEHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e8Hqq7kqshvk.CfLqa.Czw--~B/aD0yNTAxO3c9NDQ0NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnwashington.com/89127af8dfb2e10bb045758c878fd98c", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
