According to Correa, he was dispatched to the scene on Wednesday morning and where a car with an unconscious driver inside was sitting near the train tracks.\n\nThe driver had his head resting against the steering wheel with blood coming out.\n\nCorrea told Cooper he didn't realize a speeding train was barreling down the tracks until the headlights glared at him.\n\nUtah Highway Patrol Trooper Ruben Correa (right) went on Anderson Circle Full Circle on Thursday to talk about his heroic save\n\nCorrea (pictured): 'When it all came into focus was when that train collided with the vehicle and sent that vehicle flying. That\u2019s when I realized, \u201cwow, just by a few seconds we escaped death\u201d'\n\nIn the original video, Correa can be heard yelling: 'We got a train coming!'\n\n'I was actually trying to unbuckle his seat belt and I heard a horn. I looked to my left and I saw lights. That\u2019s when I realized the train is heading straight to us,' Correa said.\n\nAlthough a situation like this would send many running, Correa's time in the Marine Corps helped him stand his ground.\n\n'I think that helped me a lot. I was in the Marine Corps and one of the things they teach you is to stay calm when something bad could possibly be happening.'\n\nGetting the driver out of the car in time proved to be tough problem with not much time to solve it.\n\nCorrea said: 'It was difficult. He was the dead weight. The difficult part was actually unbuckling his seat belt with the tunnel vision coming in.'\n\nFootage shows Correa parking his car on a grass verge before running towards the car, as the train is seen directly approaching it\n\nCorrea can be seen standing with the man as the train smashed into his car with seconds left to spare\n\n\u2018My dexterity was pretty difficult. I couldn\u2019t really feel my fingers so I had to use my thumb to unbuckle his seat belt.'\n\nDuring that time, the driver gained some consciousness and tried to feebly argue with Correa in a confused stupor.\n\nBut Correa knew he didn't have 'seconds to explain', because the train was coming fast with no signs of stopping.\n\nThat's when the highway trooper wrapped the driver in a bear hug and, using his own strength, threw him out of harm's way with just seconds to spare.\n\nLooking back, Correa can't believe how close the two men came to death and he still feels a bit sick when he watches the footage.\n\n'It was difficult after watching the videos now, but I think it was an easy decision to make at that point. I felt like I was the only person able to help out. I was just trying to protect him and keep him safe.'\n\nPictured: Official photos of the driver's crashed car after a speeding train slammed into the vehicle Wednesday morning\n\nAccording to Correa, the driver's car (pictured) was sent about 50 feet because of the oncoming train's impact\n\nPictured: Official photos of the driver's crashed car after a speeding train slammed into the vehicle Wednesday morning\n\nCorrea says the train was about a foot away from his face when it passed the two men and pushed the car about 50 feet away - not the 30 feet he originally thought.\n\n'When it all came into focus was when that train collided with the vehicle and sent that vehicle flying. That\u2019s when I realized, \u201cwow, just by a few seconds we escaped death\u201d.\u2019\n\nAfter the incident, the driver slowly realized to what could have happened if Correa wasn't intent on saving his life.\n\nHe's profusely thankful.\n\n'He came to the realization we got hit by the train and he gave me a hug,' Correa said.\n\n'He was extremely grateful I got him out of there.\u2019\n\nThe driver, who was in his 20s, was attended to by medical services and picked up by his parents later on.\n\nAfter the heart-thumping close call, Correa was given the day off of work and spent time with his family\n\nCorrea (right) explained to Cooper (left) that he had no idea the train was coming until the headlights shone at the car\n\nDramatic footage shows the moment Correa dragged an unconscious driver from his car seconds before a train smashes into the vehicle.\n\nThe incident happened at a traffic stop on the I-15 in Farmington on Wednesday morning at 6.50pm.\n\nHe was responding to a call of a car on the tracks and knew he had to act fast when he noticed the driver was slumped inside the vehicle.\n\nFootage shows Correa parking his car on a grass verge before running towards the car, as the train is seen directly approaching it.\n\nHe then manages to get the driver out as the train smashes into the car, throwing it at least a 30 foot distance ahead on the tracks.\n\nThe incident took place on the FrontRunner tracks between Pages Lane and Parrish Lane in Davis County, a Utah Transit Authority spokesman said. Thankfully no injuries were reported during the incident.\n\nThe brave officer told KSL: 'At that point, I actually wasn\u2019t really thinking, I was just doing my job.\n\nHe used his spotlight to find the car and told dispatchers when he found it on the southbound side of the freeway.\n\nHe explained that he ran over to the car on the tracks and opened the door, noticing the unconscious driver still inside.\n\nHe then dragged the unresponsive driver onto an embankment next to the tracks, having put his own life in danger also.\n\nUtah Highway Patrol Trooper Ruben Correa approached a car stuck on tracks while at a a traffic stop on northbound I-15 in Farmington on Wednesday morning\n\nHe added: 'I heard the horn from the train and was able to observe that train was coming pretty fast, anywhere between 50 and 80 miles an hour, so at that point I was a little bit concerned about that.\n\n'That's when I realized: 'Oh wow, that was a lot closer than what I would have liked.\n\n'I'm still trying to process everything that happened. I'm just very grateful that I was able to get him out and he's alive and he's back with his family now.'\n\nHe said be believed the driver had a 'possible unknown medical condition' and he was a 'deadweight' when he removed him from the vehicle.\n\nCorrea claimed that he was able to talk to the driver afterwards and both men said they were extremely fortunate that they were safe and uninjured.\n\nSince footage of the incident was uploaded on Wednesday morning, it has been viewed more than 72,000 times.\n\nThousands of users have been quick to praise the bravery of Ruben Correa for saving the man's life. Utah Highway Patrol posted footage of the rescue with the caption: 'Check out the amazing life-saving work by Trp. Correa this morning!.'", "description": "Utah Highway Patrol Trooper Ruben Correa shared the dramatic moment he dragged an unconscious driver from his car seconds before a train smashed into it", "authors": ["Lauren Edmonds For Dailymail.Com", "Leah Mcdonald For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/20/19899932-0-image-a-16_1571426167462.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
