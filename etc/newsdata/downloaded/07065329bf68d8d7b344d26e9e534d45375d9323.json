And the third one is to play towards our strengths, which is physical rugby, set-phases, mauling, scrums.\n\n\"We will definitely try to play the game at our pace, and they will try to play the game at their pace.\n\n\"That will be a tactical battle, and it's tough for me to say now who will be able to enforce that. But that will be a really big battle from the coaching staff, and the 15 players on the field.\"\n\nKick-off on Sunday is at 12:15 (SA time).\n\nTeams:\n\nJapan\n\nTBA\n\nSouth Africa\n\n15 Willie le Roux, 14 Cheslin Kolbe, 13 Lukhanyo Am, 12 Damian de Allende, 11 Makazole Mapimpi, 10 Handre Pollard, 9 Faf de Klerk, 8 Duane Vermeulen, 7 Pieter-Steph du Toit, 6 Siya Kolisi (captain), 5 Lood de Jager, 4 Eben Etzebeth, 3 Frans Malherbe, 2 Bongi Mbonambi, 1 Tendai Mtawarira\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Malcolm Marx, 17 Steven Kitshoff, 18 Vincent Koch, 19 RG Snyman, 20 Franco Mostert, 21 Francois Louw, 22 Herschel Jantjies, 23 Frans Steyn\n\n- Compiled by Lloyd Burnard", "description": "When Bongi Mbonambi made his Springbok debut against Ireland in 2016, he was somewhat of a surprise inclusion in the national side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/204/613a4d77eee4432eb21818a63c3edb3b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
