Here's why.", "language": "en", "text": "The NBA and China are locked in an escalating feud sparked by a tweet that voiced support for protests in Hong Kong.\n\nThe feud began on Friday after Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted out an image that voiced support for protests in Hong Kong.\n\nSince the tweet, Chinese leagues, streaming services, sponsors, and partners, have cut ties with the Rockets and the NBA.\n\nHere's how the controversy started - and all of the events that have happened since.\n\nFor more stories go to www.BusinessInsider.co.za.\n\nThe NBA and China are locked in an escalating feud sparked by a tweet that voiced support for protests in Hong Kong.\n\n\n\nFor over 20 weeks, millions of people in Hong Kong have taken to the streets for increasingly violent protests. Initially, protests centered around a proposed bill that would have allowed for the extradition of Hong Kong residents to China to face trial. Now, demonstrations have ballooned into a fight against police brutality and Chinese encroachment on the semi-autonomous city.\n\nThough the bill has since been withdrawn, protests continue and have recently seen a spike in violent clashes between police and protesters as China marked its 70th anniversary on October 1. The topic of Hong Kong protests remains a sensitive issue for China, and China has been known to take harsh action against companies that so much as reference its domestic affairs or appear to threaten its authority.\n\nAs described by The New York Times, basketball is China's most popular sport, with a market representing hundreds of millions of fans. According to CNBC, more than 640 million people in China watched the 2017-2018 NBA season.\n\nOn October 4, Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted out an image which voiced support for protests in Hong Kong. In the days following, Chinese leagues, streaming services, sponsors, and partners, have cut ties with the Rockets and the NBA.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the feud, from the initial tweet to the escalating backlash.\n\nOn October 4, Morey tweeted out an image that voiced support for a protest group in Hong Kong.\n\nIn the since-deleted tweet, Morey posted the symbol of Stand With Hong Kong, an activist group that has been behind calls for foreign government intervention in Hong Kong.\n\nThe tweet immediately prompted backlash from Chinese social-media users, who targeted his account with angry messages and calls for his firing.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Rockets, addressed the controversy on October 5.\n\nSeeking to do damage control, Fertitta distanced the team and its shareholders from Morey's statement.\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\n\"Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets,\" he wrote.\n\nHe later defended Morey on ESPN, saying that he had \"best general manager in the league\" but that Rockets had \"no political position.\"\n\nOn October 6, the Chinese Basketball Association, which represents China in the International Basketball Federation, announced it was halting cooperation with the Rockets in response to the tweet.\n\nThe CBA's president is Yao Ming, the former NBA All-Star who played for the Rockets from 2002 to 2011.\n\n\"The Chinese Basketball Association strongly disagrees with the improper remarks by Daryl Morey, and has decided to suspend exchanges and cooperation with the team,\" the CBA said in a statement on its official account on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.\n\nSeveral of the Rocket's sponsors and partners announced that they would no longer broadcast games.\n\nState broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) and the livestreaming platform Tencent Sports, announced on October 6 that they would no longer broadcast Rockets games.\n\nTencent Holdings represents the NBA's largest digital partner outside the US. It struck a deal in July to stream games and other league programming in China reported to be worth $1.5 billion (R21 billion).\n\nThe Chinese consulate in Houston said in a statement that it was \"deeply shocked\" by what it described as Morey's \"erroneous comments on Hong Kong.\"\n\n\"We have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact,\" the statement said.\n\nOn October 6, the NBA responded and called the tweet \"regrettable.\"\n\nMorey on October 6 responded to the firestorm on Twitter, saying his views did not necessarily reflect those of the NBA or the Rockets.\n\nThe NBA also issued a statement:\n\nStatement from NBA re: Daryl Morey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial tweet: pic.twitter.com/6IJv9FJF4T \u2014 Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) October 7, 2019\n\n\"While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league supports individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\" the statement read.\n\nOn October 7, Democrat and Republican lawmakers hit back over the NBA's 'shameful' response to Chinese backlash.\n\nSome lawmakers came out in support of Morey and criticised the NBA for distancing themselves from the league manager.\n\n\"As a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party's repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong,\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on Twitter on October 7. \"Now, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey slammed the NBA for \"apologising\" to China.\n\n\"And the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticising our govt, is now apologising for criticising the Chinese gov't,\" Malinowski tweeted. \"This is shameful and cannot stand.\"\n\nThe NBA issued another statement on October 8. This time, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league would not \"censor\" players or team owners.\n\n\"The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say,\" Silver said in a statement. \"We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\n\"I do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences,\" he added. \"For those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business.\"\n\nFollowing Morey's statement, Chinese broadcasters said they would stop broadcasting NBA games.\n\n\"Any speech challenging a country's national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech,\" CCTV said in its announcement that it would be halting all broadcasts of NBA preseason games.\n\nSilver responded by calling the move \"unfortunate.\"\n\nTencent Sports followed the measure and issued a statement saying that it would temporarily stop showing all NBA preseason games.\n\nSouth Park aired an episode about Chinese censorship called \"Band in China\" and was subsequently banned in China.\n\nOn October 7, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone issued a statement mocking the ban and addressing the NBA controversy.\n\n\"Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn't look like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the great Communist Party of China. May the autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful. We good now China?\"\n\nSouth Park later aired an episode where one of its characters declares: \"F--- the Chinese government.\"\n\nOn October 8, California-based game company Blizzard banned a professional esports player and confiscated his prize money after he voiced support for Hong Kong protesters.\n\nAfter a match earlier this month, esports publication Inven Global tweeted out footage of a Hong Kong-based player known as Blitzchunggiving giving an interview where he said: \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!\"\n\nBlitzchunggiving was forced to forfeit his prize money and was banned from the league for a year.\n\nThe company later said that its \"relationships in China had no influence on our decision\" to punish the player.\n\nNBA fans have since weighed in on the controversy. From October 8, fans began showing up to games with T-shirts and signs voicing support for Hong Kong.\n\nAt the Philadelphia 76ers exhibition game against the Guangzhou Loong-Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association at Wells Fargo Center on October 8, two fans were escorted out of the arena after holding up signs and cheering in support of the protests.\n\nThe moment Sam Wachs and his wife are escorted out of the @sixers preseason game against a Chinese basketball team for yelling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Free Hong Kong.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d @6abc pic.twitter.com/3HlZxKXDzs \u2014 Christie Ileto (@Christie_Ileto) October 9, 2019\n\nThe 76ers responded in a statement, saying the protesters caused a \"disruption\" and were at the center of \"multiple complaints from guests.\" Wells Fargo Center said the two were given \"three separate warnings\" for \"disrupting the live event experience.\"\n\nOn October 9, some NBA fans at the Washington Wizards vs. Guangzhou Loong-Lions game in Washington wore \"Free Hong Kong\" T-shirts and holding protest signs said their signs were confiscated.\n\nOn October 9, all of the NBA's official Chinese partners cut ties.\n\nAll of the companies on the NBA's list of wholly-owned Chinese sponsors had suspended ties with the league as of Wednesday, according to CNN Business. Those businesses included CTrip, China's biggest online travel website, and the Chinese fast-food chain Dicos.\n\nOn October 9, promotional material for a preseason game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Los Angeles Lakers was removed from buildings across Shanghai.\n\nMeet-and-greets and media events were also postponed, an NBA spokeswoman said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe game went on as scheduled on October 10.\n\nOn October 10, a reporter for CNN was cut off from asking a question to NBA athletes about the conflict.\n\nChristina Macfarlane, a sports correspondent for CNN, was shut down during a media event with Rockets players James Harden and Russell Westbrook.\n\nShe asked the players if they would \"feel differently\" about voicing their thoughts on political and social affairs in light of the controversy.\n\n\"Excuse me, we're taking basketball questions only,\" a team representative responded.\n\n\"Excuse me, we're taking basketball questions only.\" CNN reporter shut down for asking #NBA stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook about China scandal. pic.twitter.com/QMNLdyPcEO \u2014 Telegraph Sport (@telegraph_sport) October 11, 2019\n\nThe NBA later issued an apology, saying that the representative \"inappropriately interjected\" and that the response was \"inconsistent to how the NBA conducts media events.\"\n\nAnd Nike, a major partner of the NBA that provides the league with team apparel, pulled Houston Rockets gear from several stores in China.\n\nManagers at five Nike stores in Shanghai and Beijing told Reuters on October 10 that they had been told in a company memo from management to pull all Rockets merchandise from shelves.\n\nThree stores in Shenzhen, a Chinese city which borders Hong Kong, took down all Rockets merchandise along with NBA merchandise. Three stores in Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan, also removed Rockets gear.\n\nJust as the situation appeared to be dying down, LeBron James called out Morey's tweet as \"uneducated\" on October 14.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, the Los Angeles Lakers player said that he didn't want to get into a \"feud\" but said Morey should have been more careful with his tweet.\n\n\"Yes, we all do have freedom of speech,\" he said, \"but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you're not thinking about others, and you're only thinking about yourself.\"\n\n\"I don't want to get in a word sentence feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn't educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially, but physically, emotionally, spiritually.\"\n\nIn response to James' comments, protesters in Hong Kong began burning his jerseys.\n\nAnimated show South Park even aired an episode mocking James' comments.\n\nJames later clarified the situation:\n\n\"Let me clear up the confusion,\" James tweeted. \"I do not believe there was any consideration for the consequences and ramifications of the tweet. I'm not discussing the substance. Others can talk about that.\"\n\n\"My team and this league just went through a difficult week,\" he said. \"I think people need to understand what a tweet or statement can do to others. And I believe nobody stopped and considered what would happen. Could have waited a week to send it.\"\n\nPro-democracy activists filled the stands at a preseason game between the Toronto Raptors and the Brooklyn Nets on October 18.\n\nAccording to journalist Yashar Ali, producer Andrew Duncan bought tickets to the game for 300 activists protesting against the NBA.\n\nThe protesters wore shirts and held up signs in support of Hong Kong protests. Some even held signs slamming LeBron James for his comments.\n\nShaquille \"Shaq\" O'Neal publicly defended Morey on October 22.\n\nJust minutes before the first game of the 2019-2020 NBA season, the legendary center and current sports television analyst spoke out in support of Morey.\n\n\"Daryl Morey was right,\" he said during a broadcast of \"Inside the NBA\" on TNT.\n\n\"We, as American people, do a lot of business in China,\" he said. \"And they know and understand our values and we understand their values. And one of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say, and we're allowed to speak up about injustices, and that's just how it goes.\"", "description": "Chinese leagues, streaming services, sponsors, and partners, have\u00a0cut ties with the Rockets and the NBA in response to the tweet.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2859/185459277d794d8ca5e1ffb058e54b29.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
