He also befriended Manafort, did business with Russia\u2019s state-owned gas behemoth, and became a target of Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department. He\u2019s been a constant presence in the background of the story of Russian influence in the American elections\u2014but now, he says American influence on Ukraine is the real story.\n\nIn recent years, Firtash has found himself at the heart of Ukrainian political fights with geopolitical consequences. The mogul, whose estimated net worth was $500 million in 2014, made his fortune after the Soviet Union\u2019s collapse. He told The Daily Beast he moved from Ukraine to Moscow in the early days after the USSR fell to expand his food business. After making a deal with a group of Turkmen he met at the Rossiya Hotel\u2014a now-demolished structure he described as \u201cSoviet nice\u201d\u2014he traveled to Turkmenistan to try to get them to pay up. According to Firtash, the Turkmen told him they had very little cash but lots of gas. And since Moscow was not centrally managing the gas industry, they weren\u2019t sure how to distribute and sell it. Firtash said that\u2019s how he got started as a gas trader\u2014squeezing his foot into a door that opened to fabulous wealth, extraordinary political power, and, ultimately, indictment.\n\nHis gas work also resulted in thick business ties with the Kremlin, including a 50-50 partnership with Russia\u2019s state-backed Gazprom to sell gas in Ukraine. Russia-watchers often cite this as evidence Firtash is a Moscow front. Firtash, meanwhile, claimed Gazprom courted his business because they wanted his expertise in the Central Asian gas trade.\n\nBecause of his work in the gas industry, Firtash also met a man who would become one of the globe\u2019s most notorious thugs: Semion Mogilevich, a Russian mob boss who has spent years on the FBI\u2019s Most Wanted list. Before he was poisoned in the U.K., ex-Soviet spy Alexander Litvinenko claimed Putin and Mogilevich had a \u201cgood relationship,\u201d as Business Insider detailed.\n\n\u201cHalf of the Soviet Union knows him, everyone knows him,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cHe\u2019s from Ukraine. Everyone knows him, I\u2019m not the only one who knows him. As I remember, we met in one gas company, but I don\u2019t want to name it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m acquainted with him, I\u2019ve seen him, I know him, but I never had business or anything else with him,\u201d Firtash continued, adding that it \u201cwouldn\u2019t be appropriate\u201d for him to say what gas company Mogilevich worked for.\n\nFirtash\u2019s acquaintance with Mogilevich drew public interest in 2010, when WikiLeaks posted a tranche of stolen State Department cables. One cable, from the American embassy in Kiev, detailed a conversation Firtash had with then-Ambassador Bill Taylor. According to the cable, Firtash claimed that he\u2019d needed Mogilevich\u2019s approval to get started in the gas trade. According to Firtash, the cable was a lie.\n\nFirtash said he didn\u2019t even seek out the State Department meeting that ultimately outed him as an acquaintance of Mogilevich. Instead, he said, a friend persuaded him to overcome his initial reservations and meet with the U.S. ambassador.\n\nHe and the ambassador talked for upwards of two hours, he said, and discussed \u201cthe moods in Ukraine,\u201d his background, and other benign topics.\n\n\u201cI was fine with it,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cAnd I forgot this meeting. After some time passed, suddenly WikiLeaks reveals the cable. I could not understand what it was about.\u201d\n\n\u201c Half of the Soviet Union knows him, everyone knows him...Everyone knows him, I\u2019m not the only one who knows him. \u201d \u2014 Dmitryo Firtash, on organized crime figure Mogilevich.\n\nThe cable said Firtash \u201cacknowledged ties to Russian organized crime figure Seymon Mogilevich.\u201d Firtash said someone must have fabricated that, but declined to say whom he blamed for the alleged fabrication.\n\nReached for comment, Taylor\u2014now executive vice president of the U.S. Institute of Peace\u2014declined to discuss the cable or the meeting. But he defended the State Department.\n\n\u201cWe always take good notes,\u201d he said.\n\nFour years later, federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois charged the oligarch with scheming to bribe Indian officials in an effort to secure rights to a titanium mine Boeing was interested in buying. The Justice Department is seeking his extradition from Austria. Firtash\u2019s lawyers note he has never traveled to the U.S. and that a PowerPoint slide calling for bribery was produced by the consulting firm McKinsey, and not Firtash, according to the New York Times.\n\nIn 2017, federal prosecutors working on Firtash\u2019s case called him \u201can upper-echelon associate\u201d of Russian organized crime, as The Chicago Tribune reported. Firtash\u2019s lawyers called the claim innuendo and noted that the Justice Department didn\u2019t make any such allegation when it indicted him.\n\nLast month brought a welcome development for the oligarch: Austria\u2019s procurator general, who reports to its Minister of Justice and works with its supreme court, took Firtash\u2019s side in the latest twist of his extradition dispute. According to The Kyiv Post, the official raised concerns that an Austrian court that backed the extradition did not assess whether American authorities targeted him for political reasons.\n\nFirtash has been staying in Austria since 2014, when Austrian authorities arrested him on America\u2019s behalf. His relative freedom within the country is thanks to an assist from a Russian billionaire named Vasily Anisimov, who helped him post his bond\u2014a cool $174 million. Anisimov is on the Treasury Department\u2019s 2018 so-called \u201cPutin List\u201d of oligarchs who found good fortune under Vladimir Putin\u2019s leadership, as CNN notes. When he bailed out Firtash, it raised eyebrows. But Firtash told The Daily Beast it was just business.\n\n\u201c He worked in that field for years and was very successful, and very smart. I think he had a strong understanding of this business. \u201d \u2014 Dmitryo Firtash, on Paul Manafort's Ukraine consulting firm\n\n\u201cAnisimov was looking to invest in my business prior to my arrest in Vienna,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout that time, we were negotiating the terms of that investment. When I was arrested, and they didn\u2019t allow me to pay bail with my own money, I sent my lawyers to Anisimov and suggested that he post bail for me, allowing me to leave the Austrian jail, and then we would finalize some negotiations and sign documents so that he\u2019d get a share in one of my businesses as a collateral.\u201d\n\nBesides his own legal problems, Firtash blames malign American influence for harming his country and facilitating what he calls the debasement of his fellow Ukrainians. He zeroes in on two people: Victoria Nuland, the former State Department official who became a top b\u00eate noire of the Kremlin by pushing for Ukraine to grow closer to the West and move away from Russian influence; and Joe Biden, who visited Ukraine frequently as vice president and praised its anti-Russian protests.\n\nBut Firtash didn\u2019t stiff-arm all Americans; he had a friendly relationship with Paul Manafort, whom he called successful and smart.\n\n\u201cHe had his own consulting business handling political PR and communications,\u201d Firtash told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe worked in that field for years and was very successful, and very smart. I think he had a strong understanding of this business. He brought Yanukovych victory three times.\u201d\n\nViktor Yanukovych, a Russia-friendly Ukrainian politician for whom Manafort worked, became the country\u2019s president but fled to Russia in 2014 during the Maidan Revolution. Another leaked State Department cable said Firtash had sway over a faction of Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions, which Manafort worked for and which saw its clout grow in the years leading up to Yanukovych\u2019s first election.\n\n\u201cHe was very well situated in Ukraine,\u201d Firtash said of Manafort. \u201cHe interacted with a lot of people, knew a lot of people. And I knew him well.\u201d\n\nFirtash said he last spoke to Manafort before Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted Manafort for a host of crimes, including tax-dodging by the millions, covert lobbying of foreign governments, and money laundering. Manafort pleaded guilty to a number of counts, and judges in two federal jurisdictions sentenced him to serve seven and a half years in prison.\n\n\u201c Never, not a cent. No kind of contracts, I never paid any money. \u201d \u2014 Dmitryo Firtash, on his reported interest in a deal with Manafort to invest in the Drake Hotel\n\nFirtash said that though he and Manafort would talk over coffee or tea, they never did business together. The two did discuss a deal to invest in New York\u2019s famed Drake Hot el, he said, and NBC News cited legal documents saying Firtash put money in escrow in preparation for a deal.\n\nBut he disputed that second detail.\n\n\u201cNever, not a cent,\u201d he said. \u201cNo kind of contracts, I never paid any money. It was just a conversation and a proposal that we studied and then rejected. If it had suited us, we would have gone with the project. But it didn\u2019t suit us.\u201d\n\nFirtash said he wasn\u2019t the only oligarch whose business Manafort courted.\n\n\u201cHe helped various businessmen, lobbied them, and they bought or sold things in America,\u201d he said, declining to name names.\n\n\u201cHe knew Ukraine well,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe had a whole office in Kiev with translators. He had a big office with a lot of people.\u201d\n\nWhile Firtash viewed Manafort as a savvy operator, he seems to detest Biden. And he criticized Ukrainians\u2019 response to a speech the former vice president gave on Dec. 9, 2015 to the country\u2019s parliament. In the speech, Biden praised the Maidan protests, criticized the oligarch class, and promised the United States would stand with Ukraine against Russian incursions. The audience applauded throughout.\n\n\u201cI was ashamed just to look at this, it was so repulsive,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cHe was behaving as the boss, the owner, the chief\u2014it was just horrible.\u201d\n\nMichael Carpenter, a foreign policy adviser to Biden during his time as vice president, fired back at Firtash.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take Vice President Biden\u2019s record of standing for Ukrainian democracy, helping the country reassert its sovereignty, and supporting its fight against corruption over Dmytro Firtash\u2019s record on those three issues any day,\u201d Carpenter told The Daily Beast.\n\nFirtash blamed the Americans for the Maidan revolution which deposed Yanukovych. He refers to it as \u201cthe uprising,\u201d calls it a Western-fomented coup, and said Americans basically started running the country after the revolution. And he said it scared the Russians into invading the Crimea and part of eastern Ukraine.\n\nAnd he also telegraphed pure contempt for the Ukrainians who flocked to Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. A number of powerful Ukrainians, including the former chief of staff for Yanukovych, attended the events, and their presence has reportedly drawn the attention of federal prosecutors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say who of the Ukrainians didn\u2019t go,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cIt was like a parade of such crazies who, for money, wanted to go\u2026 I don\u2019t know what they expected there in America, what they went there for. It\u2019s hard for me to explain. I would have just stopped having respect for myself. Some of them were hanging out way back by the bathrooms trying to take photos.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a nightmare,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m really ashamed of Ukrainians. They went there like crazy people. They paid money for it. What they did there, I don\u2019t understand. What did they need with Trump or that dinner\u2014I think it\u2019s just madness.\u201d\n\nHe added that the Ukrainians only went because they wanted to try to impress the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because they love Trump or think he\u2019s a great politician,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey all believed Clinton would win, so they all started kissing up in that direction, but then Trump suddenly won,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201c He\u2019s pretty crafty, capable enough of making decisions and getting things done. But I can\u2019t say that he\u2019s too smart. \u201d \u2014 Dmitryo Firtash, on President Trump\n\n\u201cSo that you understand, the Ukrainian embassy [in the U.S.] was working completely for Clinton\u2019s headquarters,\u201d Firtash claimed. \u201cOur embassy in America was working completely for Clinton. So of course when Clinton lost and Trump won, then the Ukrainian president, the government, the lawmakers, all shaken up, rushed to America to show off [to Trump]. It\u2019s very simple.\u201d\n\nFederal investigators are scrutinizing whether foreign nationals illegally funneled money to the Trump inaugural committee. And Sam Patten, an American lobbyist, pleaded guilty last year to violating federal lobbying laws. He also admitted to helping a Ukrainian oligarch get inauguration tickets.\n\n\u201cDo I need Trump? Hell no,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cI watched on TV and it was clearer to me than if I had been in that hall.\u201d\n\nThen he waxed sarcastic.\n\n\u201cI, of course, understand that he\u2019s a world philosopher and he\u2019ll give such an epic speech that you need to record it and remember it forever,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately he only made it to the third grade, he can\u2019t even talk. He has no education.\u201d\n\nTrump is fond of noting that he attended the Wharton School of Business.\n\nAsked to expound on his view of Trump\u2019s intellect, Firtash said businessmen think differently from politicians.\n\n\u201cTrump is a businessman, a person who went bankrupt four times,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not easy; he was worming his way out of trouble all the time. In that sense, he\u2019s pretty crafty, capable enough of making decisions and getting things done. But I can\u2019t say that he\u2019s too smart. That I cannot say.\u201d\n\nFirtash also claimed Trump has been harder on Putin than Obama was, including by pushing for Europe to buy more American natural gas, and that relations between the U.S. and Russia have worsened under his presidency. (Bloomberg has predicted that the natural gas dynamics in Europe will enrich both Russia and the U.S.) And he praised Trump\u2019s broad focus on the American economy.\n\n\u201cFrom the pragmatic point of view, he\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nIs Putin manipulating him?\n\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Firtash replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just the Mogilevich fairytale, Part 2.\u201d\n\nUpdate: After publication, Firtash\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, said in a statement regarding his client\u2019s comments on Biden: \u201cMr. Firtash has indicated that he never used the word \u2018detest,\u2019 nor is that an accurate description of his feelings towards Vice President Biden. He does say disagrees with Mr. Biden and other US policymakers who believe it is appropriate for American leaders to attempt to interfere in Ukraine\u2019s sovereign rights as to who to arrest or who to elect in democratic elections.\u201d", "description": "The Ukrainian mogul, a background presence in the story of Russian influence in U.S. elections, praised Manafort\u2019s savvy but dismissed Trump in an interview with The Daily Beast.", "authors": ["Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1552969243/190318-woodruff-trump-firtash-tease_ras97u", "published_at": "2019-03-19"}
