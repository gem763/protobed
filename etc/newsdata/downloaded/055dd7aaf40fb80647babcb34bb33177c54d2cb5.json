It was found that there was no corruption, but recommendations were made to improve internal systems,\" Roets said.\n\n\"The citizens council will, however, have to decide whether an independent legal team should further investigate the complaints against Boshoff. Boshoff's position could therefore possibly be in jeopardy.\"\n\nBut Boshoff says he isn't losing any sleep over this.\n\n\"Just like with President Cyril Ramaphosa, any elected official's position is, in principal, always in jeopardy.\n\n\"Orania has solid processes and I am comfortable with these. I'm not losing any sleep.\"\n\nHe said it made him uncomfortable that, while internal processes were underway, half truths were being brought into the open by people who had problems with these processes.\n\n'Afrikaners' money being squandered'\n\nSome of the other issues being investigated include allegations against several former officials and staff members of the organisation, relating to overseas travels, conflicts of interest, a loan from the growth fund, and a general lack of governance.\n\nIt was also recommended that other organisations be investigated. These includes Gousblom Ontwikkeling \u2013 a company that counts among its shareholders the Orania Beweging Helpsaamfonds \u2013 and Solidariteit Helpende Hand.\n\nMembers of the movement said they wanted to bring the issue into the open as \"Afrikaners' collected money was being squandered\", and that they feared a \"cover-up\".\n\n*This article appeared in Beeld and Volksblad and is published with the permission of the former title's editor.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "The purchase of Mercedes-Benz, a 45% salary increase, as well as a long list of accusations of mismanagement and infighting are some of the issues plaguing Carel Boshoff, president of the Orania movement in the Northern Cape.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8778/7fbd5984d7bc4d18852052d5f3391705.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-24"}
