At the time, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan condemned the case as a political attack on his government.\n\nAtilla was released and returned to Turkey in July, and on Monday Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, Erdogan\u2019s son-in-law, named him CEO of the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe were not consulted and we do not support it,\u201d the EBRD\u2019s managing director for communications Jonathan Charles told Reuters. \u201cWe will discuss the matter with authorities.\u201d\n\nThe EBRD has a 10% stake in Borsa Istanbul, its second-largest holder, and has pressed for years for it to do an initial public offering with little traction. Last year the exchange was the 15th largest in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nHalkbank, Turkey\u2019s second-largest state bank, has not fallen off the U.S. radar despite Atilla\u2019s return home. Last week U.S. prosecutors charged it with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.\n\nHalkbank dismissed the charges as part of broader U.S. sanctions over Turkey\u2019s two-week old offensive against Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria, while Erdogan has called them an \u201cunlawful, ugly\u201d step.\n\nA spokesperson for the Treasury was not available to comment on the EBRD\u2019s opposition.\n\n\u201cIt is a fact that we have been experiencing some problems in certain issues with EBRD,\u201d said a Turkish official. \u201cI think we can overcome these.\u201d\n\nBut a person close to the EBRD, who also requested anonymity, said Ankara and the bank \u201chave had issues realising projects, keeping promises made and in appointments such as this one for a couple of years\u201d.\n\nNaming Atilla CEO \u201cis actually highlighting the issues that have accumulated,\u201d the person said. \u201cI do not know how much this will affect the EBRD\u2019s work in Turkey but it seems like the problem is growing.\u201d\n\nA former Halkbank deputy general manager, Atilla was listed on Tuesday on the bourse's website here as CEO, member, and acting chairperson.\n\n\u201cThe EBRD clearly expressed its objection,\u201d said a separate person with knowledge of the matter.\n\n\u201cThe EBRD member on the board did not agree with this appointment,\u201d the person said, adding that the EBRD\u2019s opposition did not create a legal obstacle.\n\nBorsa Istanbul\u2019s 378 listings had a domestic market capitalization of $149.3 billion last year, while its net profit, at 993 million lira ($170 million), was up 225% from 2018.", "description": "The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development opposes the Turkish government's decision to name Hakan Atilla, a former Halkbank executive who was jailed in the United States, as chief executive of the Istanbul bourse in which it has a big stake.", "authors": ["Orhan Coskun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
