Not only is it beautifully preserved and an astonishing rarity but it is also an important historical document.\n\n'Scholars have identified the site of the mine itself as Ma'din Bani Sulaim, located north-west of the Holy City of Mecca.\n\n'Gold has been mined in this region for thousands of years, and the site is still worked today.'\n\nThe sale takes place on October 24.", "description": "The Umayyad gold dinar is set to sell with auctioneers Morton & Eden in London who have given it their highest ever pre-sale estimate of between \u00a31.4 and \u00a31.6million.", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/11/19651286-0-image-a-33_1570961241739.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
