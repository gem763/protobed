Photo: Intelligencer/Getty Images\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations will open its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, will sweep through thousands of cities worldwide. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer will be publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nToday, September 17, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation released its annual \u201cGoalkeepers\u201d report \u2014 a data-heavy status update measuring global progress toward the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. (It always doubles as a report card on the work of the foundation.)\n\nThis year\u2019s edition focuses on inequality and the ways that gender and geography remain obstacles to opportunity in much of the world \u2014 \u201cWe were born in a wealthy country to white, well-off parents who lived in thriving communities and were able to send us to excellent schools,\u201d the report opens, before moving on to focus on primary health care and \u201cdigital inclusion\u201d (the way that technology has helped the distribution of cooking gas in India, for instance).\n\nBut it also devotes a significant chapter to climate change, a growing focus for Gates and the foundation, and in particular climate adaptation \u2014 the challenge of how to actually live in a world transformed by global warming. As an investor, Gates has backed dozens of companies developing new tech to at least help slow down temperature rise \u2014 from next-generation nuclear to new battery technology and beyond. But the foundation has always directed its giving toward what it considers \u201cmarket failures\u201d and the plight of the world\u2019s poor, and so Gates\u2019s philanthropic work on climate change is less focused on stopping global warming than on dealing with it.\n\nOn August 5, in Seattle, I talked to him about balancing the prerogatives of adaptation and mitigation, the scale of the challenge of climate change and whether we have any realistic chance of avoiding catastrophic levels of warming, and just how punishingly unequal the impacts of climate change will be when they do arrive.\n\nYou and Melinda describe yourselves as \u201cimpatient optimists.\u201d The impatient part is especially interesting to me because I come at some of these big questions from climate, and the timeline there really has changed my perspective about the broad trajectory of progress in the world. Has it changed yours?\n\nIf you asked Warren Buffett still what he worries about the most, he\u2019ll talk about nuclear weapons.\n\nIn a way, that is rational.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s a little scary, actually. The current generation is thinking about climate change appropriately, but we didn\u2019t actually get rid of those nuclear weapons.\n\nBut putting aside climate change, the trajectory and nuclear weapons and big pandemics and bioterrorism, all of which are worthy of attention, the general trajectory of the world is very positive. Scientific understanding has given us new vaccines and new drugs and better seeds, cheaper ways to make fertilizer, digital ways that we can track: Is the government spending its money properly? Are people who go to the health clinic getting treated the way they want? So there\u2019s a lot of things that have us on this very positive arc. In fact, the last 30 years, since 1990, we\u2019ve made more progress on reducing child mortality than at any time in history.\n\nBut how about climate change?\n\nClimate change is a super-important topic, and sadly the mitigation part, which is very, very important, has gotten 95 percent to the attention \u2014 though not enough that we can say we\u2019re in good shape there. The greatest expert on energy is V\u00e1clav Smil. Whenever you spend time with V\u00e1clav, he\u2019s like, \u201cOh, yeah? You\u2019re going to do what in 20 years?\u201d\n\nI was just reading a piece of his earlier on that this morning.\n\nHis stuff is so good. You can\u2019t get enough of him. He\u2019s coming out with a new book \u2026\n\nGrowth, yeah.\n\nSuper-good. It\u2019s just a reminder that the modern economy is about energy intensity. This idea that we\u2019ll take 100 million barrels a day and just not use them, that we\u2019ll just say, \u201cNo, no. No, thank you\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s very hard.\n\nIf we are imagining a world in which we take some dramatic action and engineer some kind of meaningful solution to this challenge, what does that look like to you? How big a part of it is nuclear power? How big a part of it is carbon capture? How big a part of it is new cement? How do you see that big picture?\n\nThere\u2019s a long answer to that. I would like to help educate people on what a plan really means. A plan involves looking at all the sources, electricity, transport, industry, buildings, and land use/agriculture and really saying, \u201cOkay, what are the possible paths that get you to these dramatic reductions, and therefore what are the missing inventions?\u201d Fortunately, there\u2019s not any one path. If you don\u2019t have nuclear and if you don\u2019t have a storage miracle, it\u2019s very, very hard, because basically what you have to do is have electricity be used for many, many, many things like all building heating and cooling that today, you use natural gas or coal for it directly.\n\nSo, first, you have to assume you can make electricity with zero emission. Then you assume you can make the electric sector almost three times bigger than it is today \u2014 these are mind-blowing investments. I want to help educate people because I have not seen anything that\u2019s worthy of the word plan because a plan has to involve not just the U.S. doing something.\n\nOf course, yeah.\n\nYou have to convince middle-income countries. I think of India as paradigmatic, because it\u2019s big enough to count and it\u2019s poor enough. They deserve to have air conditioning. I mean, they\u2019re getting very high wet-bulb temperatures. Jesus Christ, by 2070, there could be just a massive number of people dropping dead in the streets.\n\nSo a plan that really addresses the global issue has to bring what I call the green premium for all of these various goods and services down dramatically, like over 90 percent.\n\nWhat\u2019s the green premium?\n\nWhat would green cement cost today? What would green steel cost today? What would green beef cost today? It\u2019s great that people care about the issue, but it\u2019s a very complex issue. And, unfortunately once they hear about how hard it is to solve and how expensive it is to solve, I hope their resolve isn\u2019t \u2026 When diesel prices got increased 15 percent in France, more near-term considerations came into play.\n\nThe international picture there is so important because each individual nation, with the possible exception of the U.S. and China, is contributing only so little, and so they have less motivation to act dramatically. Given all that, what do you think should count as success, and what should count as failure? Do you credit a goal of two degrees? Do you think that that\u2019s overly optimistic? How do you define success in the climate story?\n\nThere are no magic numbers. The smaller the temperature increase the better. People who say that this number\u2019s associated with \u201cIt\u2019s all over, don\u2019t even try.\u201d No, that\u2019s not true, but wow. As that number goes up three, four, the amount of sea rise you lock in, the amount of ecosystem loss that you lock in, it gets to be super, super high. So you just don\u2019t want to run the experiment.\n\nIt\u2019d be great if we could stop at two degrees. Unless there are huge surprises on scientific advances, I just don\u2019t see it happening, but who would have said that [about] radio waves or wireless or chips with a billion transistors? We know V\u00e1clav is not optimistic. Yet to really get people engaged, you have to say, \u201cHey, we can really achieve this thing.\u201d The fact that the R&D budgets weren\u2019t even being discussed \u2026\n\nR&D does seem very important.\n\nI mean, not to be egocentric, but that was put on to the Paris climate agenda because I went to France and said, \u201cHey, here\u2019s something you get to do that\u2019s going to be different.\u201d Then it turned out that was the way of getting Modi to actually come to the thing, which was fantastic.\n\nEspecially given the impacts expected to India you mentioned earlier.\n\nNathan Myhrvold and Ken Caldeira wrote an article that really shows that, if you take the very best case, a 1.5 degree case \u2014 which, we\u2019re not in that universe, period \u2014 you don\u2019t have a cooler year for 50 years. If you take a three-degree case \u2014 and even that would require us to do better than we\u2019re doing today \u2014 you don\u2019t have a cooler year for 100 years.\n\nThe scientific community, in terms of dealing with disasters, is always very cautious to not be an alarmist group. And so the general literature, because it\u2019s done by scientists, understates these things by quite a bit. Take permafrost melting and methane release. Well, we thought that was a problem. Then we didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. Now, actually, we\u2019re back to thinking it is a problem. There are things like the Atlantic circulation. For a while we thought that was a problem. Now we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem. Sudden ice collapse, we didn\u2019t think that was a problem. Now in the geological record, we actually do think sudden ice collapse may be a serious thing in parts of Antarctica.\n\nIf people keep their current seeds, then agricultural productivity will go down a lot. Monsanto has different seeds for different parts of the U.S. depending on the temperature, and, already, the seeds that they used to give to Texas, they now give to the Midwest. The beef lots \u2014 they used to fatten cows down in Texas, now nobody does it anymore because it\u2019s too hot there, and so all the meatpacking is moving north. It\u2019ll be in Canada.\n\nRelatively soon.\n\nBy 2060 or 2070, for decent productivity, it has to go up to Canada.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that if you can\u2019t change the seeds you use, then this is a disaster, because weather is already a problem for subsistence farmers. It\u2019s always just a question of how many years do they have a super-bad crop. Rich-world farmers can take their average output and live on the average output because they have a savings bank or crazy government programs, so they don\u2019t face starvation. Poor-world farmers already behave in ways that at first we thought were kind of crazy where they diversify their crops in a way that makes their average output really low. But once people thought about it and realized, Oh, they\u2019re trying to really reduce the probability that the number of calories they\u2019ll have for themselves or their children \u2026\n\nWill disappear entirely.\n\nSo they grow way more cassava than they should. Cassava is a very low productivity plant, but it\u2019s an emergency crop because it can withstand worse weather conditions than every crop but, say, sorghum. Sorghum\u2019s really good with heat.\n\nBut we need a huge improvement in the seeds to deal with drought, to deal with heat. I don\u2019t know if we can get it or not, to be honest. I\u2019m an optimist. The last time the world worried \u2026 Paul Ehrlich wrote The Population Bomb, predicting everything was going to turn out Malthusian. He was wrong. Two things happened that he and nobody else knew.\n\nNorman Borlaug happened.\n\nWell, the Green Revolution, which Borlaug was key in, and people chose to have less children. So the population estimates were way too high and the total calories produced because of the new seeds and fertilizer. Those seeds require massive amounts of nitrogen. If you use those seeds without nitrogen, you get hardly anything, and Africa has very little access to fertilizer. They have the worst soils in the world, and they\u2019re equatorial.\n\n\n\nThat suggests you can address some of these issues with regenerative agriculture practices, right, in addition to designing better seeds?\n\nThere are things like no till, where the amount of soil erosion is greatly reduced. Hand farming, though, never has the erosion problems that mechanized farming does.\n\nWe also need to get air conditioning into the equatorial regions, particularly urban equatorial regions, and we need to get the crops so that they can withstand drought and that your good years you have a lot more productivity. You\u2019re going to have bad years. There are years where rain doesn\u2019t come, and there\u2019s no seed in the world that can do a damn thing about that. There\u2019s a few things that are miraculous. Like, we came up with this form of rice. Usually when rice gets flooded, it dies. We funded a thing where the rice just goes into stasis. Then when the water goes away, it goes back and it grows. That\u2019s one of those things where you have this field over here where there\u2019s nothing and this field over here where there\u2019s really something. But that is so rare that you get something like that.\n\nIt\u2019s crazy that the world isn\u2019t focused on making better seeds and talking through this adaptation stuff. There\u2019s a recent thing about how as you raise CO2 levels that the micronutrients in the plants goes down. There\u2019s only $5 million of random messing around that was ever spent to look at that. Now it looks like we\u2019re going to have to go and fund a real study to see, Is that true across all crops? Why would that be true? It\u2019s completely out of the blue, completely unexpected, and may or may not even be true. If it is true, our whole malnutrition thing is going to be even more deeply challenged.\n\nSo big picture?\n\nHuge uncertainties, huge underinvestment. Even when you get people who are activated on this issue, you say to them, \u201cHey, what do you know about adaptation?\u201d There was a thing called the Green Climate Fund, which was supposed to be $10 billion. Obama got a little money to it, but then it \u2014\n\nIt died, basically.\n\nI think he got $1.6 billion before he left office. But if you look at the stuff they are going to spend their money on, it\u2019s ridiculous stuff that are complete rounding errors. They\u2019re not systemic things like better seeds or better air conditioning. They\u2019re just a little project here and a little project there, which \u2014 it doesn\u2019t add up to anything. So climate change is definitely a footnote. And just because we\u2019ve met challenges in the past doesn\u2019t guarantee that we\u2019ll meet challenges this time. Can we build new nuclear reactors that are super-safe? Will the world accept those? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m the world\u2019s biggest funder of that dream, but even I would say that our chance of success \u2026\n\nWhat is it?\n\nSay our chance of success technologically is like 70 percent, then our chance of convincing the world to take advantage of it, say that\u2019s like 40 percent, so you have a 28 percent likely thing, which would be super-helpful because it\u2019s 24-hour reliable energy. You can\u2019t afford not to do it, but the world is crazy. The world is not investing \u2026 Even China, which is investing the most, isn\u2019t investing as much as they should.\n\nThey pulled out of working with TerraPower, right?\n\nThe U.S. forced us to not work with China, so they\u2019re on their own now, and I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll do. Will the U.S. support us to build a pilot plant here in the U.S.? If you had a big climate initiative where there were, say, $20 billion of R&D being spent, if 5 percent of that could go to nuclear, that\u2019s more than enough money for this dream to be fully pursued. Anyway, we\u2019re trying to get the seed stuff funded. The seed stuff, some of it, depending on how you define the word GMO \u2026\n\nIt has a similar problem as nuclear.\n\nYeah. The Europeans who are the most generous donors in the world, giving in some cases 0.7 percent of GDP, which is this level that the movement tried to get everybody up to \u2026 Anyway, some of them are very uncomfortable with the scientific techniques. Yes, there\u2019s still room to do a better job of conventional breeding, but when you\u2019re dealing with the type of temperature increase we\u2019re talking about, no way. You are going to have to do genetic modification.\n\nWell, and there\u2019s no real scientific argument against it.\n\nNo, there\u2019s not. Yes, everything should be subject to review just like medicines are, but that one\u2019s a troubling one. Will those things get out of adoption? We don\u2019t really care whether Europe adopts them or not. We\u2019re not trying to tell them that they should adopt them. We\u2019re just trying to have them let Africa and poor countries in Asia, but mostly Africa \u2014\n\nIs there that kind of resistance in the developing world to GMOs, or is mostly a wealthy country issue?\n\nThey are completely confused. What Europe does is they say, \u201cOkay, if you want to export to us, if we detect even 0.1 percent of GMO in your exports, we\u2019ll ban your exports.\u201d That\u2019s really kind of unfair for the crops that Africa tries to export. The U.S., by and large, encourages Africa to be open-minded.\n\nThere\u2019s two issues on GMOs. One is, is there a commercial problem that you become dependent and that U.S. seed manufacturers charge too much money? Then there\u2019s, is there a health risk involved? But the stuff we\u2019re talking about doing is all public-domain stuff, so we have to tell people, \u201cHey, this is not Monsanto.\u201d Now, I have nothing against Monsanto. In fact, they\u2019ve contributed more to the base understanding of these things than any company in the world.\n\nThe big theme of this year\u2019s Goalkeepers\u2019 Report is, essentially, inequality of opportunity. The thing that I was personally struck by was the matter of inequality within countries in the global South. We hear a lot about inequality within countries in the global North and between the countries of the global North and the global South, and much less about how one region in Nigeria could be performing so much better than another region in Nigeria. How important is it to address those inequities in the broader fight against inequity globally?\n\nYou have the rich countries who get to fund innovation and fund aid. Then you have middle-income countries like China that have done amazingly well, and they have their explicit goals. I want to say they have 42 million people still living in extreme poverty, and by 2022 they\u2019ll halve that. They have a department that I\u2019ve gone and met with that we actually work with that does it in a very Chinese way, but they have a list of the 42 million people, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cOh, this one has to move.\u201d Not many governments have the tools at their command that they have. And there, extreme poverty will be very low \u2014 though there will still be a sort of a seaboard-to-interior-type differential.\n\nIn India, it\u2019s a North-South. The South is way better. Kerala is below replacement rate in population growth. Whereas Uttar Pradesh is still 3 percent growth rate. In India, there\u2019s a part of India that\u2019s like sub-Saharan Africa, a part of India that\u2019s more like coastal China, all within one country. And within India, it\u2019s really great, because there is this sense of interstate competition, and practices do spread. The jealousy factor of, \u201cOh, if they can do it, we can do it,\u201d is really useful. You cannot go to India and say, \u201cOh, you\u2019re worse than China.\u201d That\u2019s like, who cares? That\u2019s just insulting for you to even notice that. But saying, \u201cHey, your state is almost as good as this other state, if you would just do this and this\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s different. Chief ministers really respond to the sub-national sense of, \u201cOh okay, they can do it. I\u2019m going to try and do this.\u201d So it\u2019s a very positive dynamic.\n\nNigeria\u2019s a very scary one where the South is way better than the North. The population growth is almost entirely in the North, with a broken-down primary health-care system. The North of Nigeria is really bad. The state is almost not there. They just don\u2019t raise enough money, and they don\u2019t spend the tiny amount they raise very well at all. So these differentials are really gigantic.\n\nYou get to Somalia or DRC, then they aren\u2019t as gigantic. Those are just very, very tough places. But there\u2019s various statistics about that [that] more people in extreme poverty won\u2019t live in the worse-off countries partly because Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Indonesia, India, have a lot of population, so there\u2019s a lot of very poor people in those countries because the population combined in those countries is double the balance of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAnd Nigeria in particular is growing really rapidly.\n\nThe population is growing. The economy, they did this base adjustment. They\u2019re still very oil dependent. Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people, so it really counts \u2014 that\u2019s 200 million of 840 million people in all of sub-Saharan Africa in one country. It really counts. Almost every disease the foundation works on now, it used to be India was No. 1. Now, for most of our diseases, Nigeria is No. 1. Even the rates of malarial deaths in Nigeria are amongst the highest in the entire world.\n\nOn top of which, the babies are choosing to be born in the tough places. That\u2019s true if you do it on a continental basis where today 22 percent are born in Africa. It goes to 50 percent by the end of the century. But even if you take on a country basis, it\u2019s the poorer countries, and even if you take within the country, like in Nigeria, the babies are choosing to be born in the North. Then you have climate sitting right on top of that.\n\nCan you take lessons from, say, the South of Nigeria and use them to help the North? What are the obstacles there?\n\nThe number of meetings I\u2019ve been in where I\u2019ve said that and people are like, \u201cOh, no.\u201d But, yes.\n\nHow?\n\nIf you trust government to spend money well, then you\u2019re willing to be taxed. If you think that money is totally misspent, you aren\u2019t. And so you get these equilibrium conditions either within a country or within regions of a country, where people have so little expectation that the government will work on their behalf. Everybody joins a gang, and you hope that your gang gets elected because they won\u2019t grow the pie for everybody, but you\u2019ll just get a disproportionate share of a very small pie. That\u2019s what democratic politics is in many poor countries.\n\nHow big a part of that problem of those inequities is gender? When you think of these challenges, how big a focus for you is making sure that women are educated at the same levels and also family planning [is] liberated from the burdens of all that stuff?\n\nIf you look at countries dropping down their population growth or raising female education levels or reducing child and infant mortality, those three things are super-correlated to each other \u2014 like super-correlated.\n\nWomen\u2019s groups are this amazing tactic. Because an individual woman saying \u201cHey, I went to the health-care clinic and the line\u2019s too long or the vaccines weren\u2019t there\u201d has just no voice. In fact, sometimes they\u2019re not even allowed to leave their hut and go get the vaccinations. So if you create women\u2019s groups, even that basic idea of \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to go to the health center\u201d or you get told vaccination is this very important thing to do, that works out very well. Letting the women have [their] own digital money account, that works out pretty well.\n\nThese things take time, so some of the cultural issues are tough. The women tend to meet with the women, and the men tend to meet with the men as you\u2019re going into these villages, so that saying \u201cPoverty is sexist\u201d is really strong. That is, women are the most disadvantaged by the power and balance in these poor countries. And there are very few exceptions. As countries get richer, Japan\u2019s not a perfect case, but by and large, as you get richer, your gender empowerment gets stronger. You can use gender empowerment to drive the other things. Women\u2019s education, of all things, first getting them all into primary school, which the world\u2019s done a very good job on. Except the Sahel, by and large, elementary-school participation rates are balanced. If you get to secondary, that\u2019s less the case.\n\nPulling out of places like Nigeria and the Sahel \u2014 the subject of inequality is now a much bigger part of our conversation in a country like the U.S. We\u2019ve been talking about inequality for a while, of course, but it seems to me that in the past year there\u2019s been a renewed focus maybe powered especially by that Anand Giridharadas book, the Rutger Bregman speech at Davos about the value of philanthropy in the world that we live in today. I think everybody, even people who criticized that system would say, \u201cThe Gates Foundation is the gold standard here,\u201d and I totally agree. I wonder how you feel about the broader structure of society, though \u2014 whether there are things that philanthropies can do that governments can\u2019t do. I know you support higher taxation generally but wonder whether you think that we\u2019re in a healthy place where so much of our most ambitious investment and R&D and thinking is being taken up by private philanthropists rather than by the public sector.\n\nWell, overall, philanthropy is pretty small. In the U.S. economy, it\u2019s 2 percent, and a third of that\u2019s just giving to your church, so it\u2019s a very small part of the economy, and so you can\u2019t expect it to do ultramagical things. You could try getting rid of it and give that to some bureaucrat. Yes, government needs more money. The safety net has constantly been going up, and we\u2019re rich enough the safety net can go up more. We can have more progressive taxation. We can reduce concentration of wealth through things like estate tax; the wealth tax maybe, maybe not. At least people are discussing it now. Is that really particular? Does it work? In the last ten years, Europe got rid of their wealth taxes. And you may need cooperation between countries to really do it well because of leakage effects.\n\nShould people be allowed to give to their church? Probably. United Way for local social services? Probably. Should they get tax deductions? All these tax issues, that\u2019s all up in the air. If somebody wants to be less generous on the tax deductions, that\u2019s okay. The way the estate tax works, where whatever you put into a foundation is exempt from the estate tax, it does increase the level of giving. Now, do you get back commensurately what you want from it? It makes people more tolerant to the very high estate tax, which [is] why I kind of like it.\n\nAnyway, the democratic process will resolve that. Recently, taxes become more favorable to the rich, although people are confused about that. But, honestly, they did, so it\u2019s kind of this weird thing. I think most of the noise is about progressive taxation and should the people of these big fortunes have had to pay a lot more taxes? Then there\u2019s criticisms of philanthropy, and of course there should be criticism. We benefit from a lot of criticism. Should we put more money into this? More money into that, those kinds of things? I\u2019m so involved in philanthropy, it\u2019s hard for me to be objective about it.", "description": "On September 17, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation released its \u201cGoalkeepers\u201d report \u2014 a status update measuring progress toward the U.N.\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals.
