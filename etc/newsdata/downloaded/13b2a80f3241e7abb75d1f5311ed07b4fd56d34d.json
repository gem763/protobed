Over that time, complacency and inefficiency, reflective of lower priorities in education, and inconsistencies among the various school systems contribute to a decline.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s partly to blame.\n\nSo\u2019s this: administrative bloat.\n\nBetween 1950 and 2009, the student population of America\u2019s public schools grew by 96%. The growth in teachers during that same time was 252%. But the growth of administrators and other office staffers? That jumped 702%, American Enterprise Institute reported.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s public schools are bloated with bureaucracy and skinny on results,\u201d wrote Benjamin Scafidi at The Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice.\n\nOh so true.\n\nWhereas one school, one principal used to be the norm, nowadays that same size school employs one principal, multiple assistant principals. numerous assistants to the assistant principals and principals \u2014 along with all the accompanying office staff. That doesn\u2019t even get to the guidance department, where ridiculously large numbers of guidance personnel are needed just to keep up with all the new social justice, diversity, tolerance and anti-bullying campaigns that pass as education, occupying school hours that could be better spent \u2014 that used to be spent \u2014 on math, history, science and the like.\n\nYour tax dollars at work.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget the creation of the biggest bureaucratic bloated float of them all, the Department of Education, where teachers\u2019 rights and union dollars take precedence over students\u2019 achievement and real learning. Where the rights of the parents to control their children\u2019s upbringing and education become subservient to the will of the government to train in the proper propaganda way. Your Jimmy Carter at work.\n\nAnd this is what the government\u2019s training has brought.\n\n\u201cArlington Public Schools quietly push transgender policies despite parent opposition,\u201d ran one Washington Examiner headline in May.\n\nAnother, from USA Today, from just a few days ago: \u201cMy daughter thinks she\u2019s transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s more, much more.\n\n\u201cThe Racist Beginnings of Standardized Testing,\u201d the National Education Association posited in a headline from 2018.\n\n\u201cHow Black Lives Matter is moving into the schools,\u201d The New York Post reported, just this week.\n\n\u201cFlorida teacher reportedly banned students from wearing crosses,\u201d The Blaze wrote in 2017, about a lawsuit that had brewed on behalf of alleged persecuted Christian students.\n\n\u201cPublic Schools Teaching American Kids that Socialism is Better than Capitalism,\u201d wrote Jeremiah Poff on ToddStarnes.com in May.\n\nThat one explains today\u2019s political climate \u2014 yes?\n\nBut really, the transgender fight alone should fuel patriots in general, and Christians in particular, to sit up, stand up and shout out: No. Not in my backyard.\n\nNot in my school is a boy who suddenly decides he\u2019s a girl going to go into my daughter\u2019s locker room and change alongside her.\n\nNot in my school is my daughter going to be accused of hate speech for protesting the intrusion of privacy \u2014 the perverted intrusion of privacy.\n\nAnd when the schools won\u2019t listen?\n\nThrow the bums out. Run for School Board. Take over the local education system and dominate the discussions.\n\nSet the policies, quiet the radical clowns, hush the petulant sue-happy special interests.\n\nSend the crazies back to crazy town.\n\nThat right there is the single most effective action Christians, conservatives, constitutionalists, patriots and traditionalists can take right now to right this teetering ship called Public Schools \u2014 and, in the long term, to bring back some sense and solid constitutional grounding to our entire political structure.\n\nAs Vladimir Lenin reportedly said, it only takes one generation of youth to transform the world.\n\nThe left, in America, has had its generation. It\u2019s time to take back and teach right.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
