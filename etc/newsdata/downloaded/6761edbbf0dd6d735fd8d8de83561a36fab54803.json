(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nWhile some NBA coaches choose to stay silent on the NBA-China issue, San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich \u2014 one never afraid to voice his opinion on political issues \u2014 gave his unwavering support to NBA commissioner Adam Silver amid the escalating rift between the NBA and China.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous,\u201d Popovich told reporters at the Spurs-Miami Heat preseason game Tuesday. \u201cCompared to what we\u2019ve had to live through the last three years, there\u2019s a big difference gap there leadership-wise and courage-wise.\u201d\n\nThe NBA is facing backlash from China over a tweet sent by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey in support of protesters in Hong Kong and over comments made by Silver in support of Morey, free speech and NBA values.\n\n\u201cThe NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues,\u201d Silver said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cWe simply could not operate that way.\u201d\n\nChina responded by saying it won\u2019t televise two preseason games this week in China between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets on state-run CCTV, and multiple Chinese companies have suspended business relationships with the league.\n\nGolden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr and Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers didn\u2019t comment on the NBA-China issue, saying they didn\u2019t know enough about the topic.\n\nGregg Popovich reacts during the second half of the Spurs' preseason game against the Heat on Tuesday.

Nation pulls plug on airing games\n\nPopovich also took the opportunity to compare Silver\u2019s words to President Trump, without mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for him to say,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe said that in an environment that is fraught with possible economic peril. He sides with the principles that we all hold dearly \u2014 or most of us did until the last three years \u2014 so I\u2019m thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard about all the questions the talking heads have for the last three years: What kind of country do we want to be? Who are we? Where do we want to go? That sort of thing. Adam said something that helps you understand what direction you need to go in rather than the cowardice of not being able to respond to something like the murder of Mr. (Jamal) Khashoggi. There are many, many incidents like that where leadership and courage mean nothing (and) it\u2019s all about personal aggrandizement.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt.", "description": "San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich gave his unwavering support to NBA commissioner Adam Silver amid the escalating rift between the NBA and China.", "authors": ["Jeff Zillgitt", "Published P.M.
