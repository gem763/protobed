Even Wolff has acknowledged this season that the allure of Ferrari\u2019s unrivalled history in the sport could prove irresistible, joking: \u201cEveryone has the desire to go with the redhead.\u201d\u200b\n\nBut here in Mexico City, where Hamilton has the opportunity on Sunday to seal his sixth world title, Wolff appeared to scotch the Ferrari links altogether. \u201cI think that this Ferrari thing has maybe been blown out of proportion,\u201d he said. \u201cLewis has a clear opinion on where he sees himself in future, and we are, and have always been, very loyal to our drivers.

These discussions have slowly but surely started.\u201d\u200b", "description": "Lewis Hamilton is all but certain to end his career at Mercedes, with team principal Toto Wolff giving his strongest indication yet that the five-time world champion would spurn a move to Ferrari in favour of signing a final contract at the Silver Arrows.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/26/TELEMMGLPICT000214227993-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0PK6rQM6QMm_uQOSzVPjFp5ipUK89bSZbgZPZqf-IQI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
