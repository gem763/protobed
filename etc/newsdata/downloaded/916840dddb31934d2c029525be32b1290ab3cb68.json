Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said Wednesday morning on Twitter, referring to the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. \u201cStill inside \u2014 more details to come.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers staged the dramatic protest while making process arguments that sidestepped the substance of the central allegations underpinning the impeachment inquiry. Democrats accused the protesting members of compromising security by taking their phones into the secure area, where cellphones are barred.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore entering the closed-door hearing, Republican lawmakers held a news conference to decry how Schiff, the California Democrat who runs the Intelligence Committee, was carrying out the panel\u2019s portion of the impeachment inquiry. Several complained about the private nature of the proceedings and claimed that the inquiry was part of a long-running attempt by Democrats to overturn the result of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut none of the 13 Republicans who spoke defended Trump on the central allegation that he had pushed Ukraine to investigate Democrats while blocking military aid that had been approved for Kyiv.\n\nDamning testimony from William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, has rocked the White House\u2019s impeachment defense, making it more difficult for Republicans to claim that Trump did nothing wrong. Taylor told lawmakers that Trump had personally intervened to push Ukraine to announce investigations targeting Democrats as part of a quid pro quo linking stalled U.S. military aid to political assistance from Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Taylor\u2019s testimony, which included a 15-page opening statement obtained by The Washington Post, some Republicans appeared to abandon Trump\u2019s forceful defense that there was no quid pro quo, opting for more-nuanced arguments.\n\n\u201cThis is a messy moment, no doubt,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-Neb.). \u201cBut at the same time, does it rise to a level of criminality \u2014 impeachment of a president? Doesn\u2019t look that way to me, and the process, by the way, is very unfair. And this is what is undermining the credibility of House of Representatives.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans highlighted the White House\u2019s difficulty in keeping the party in line as more damaging evidence emerges from the impeachment proceedings.\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) also complained about the process but told reporters Wednesday that Taylor\u2019s testimony was not positive for the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe picture coming out of it based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen I would say is not a good one, but I would say also until we have a process that allows for everybody to see this in full transparency, it\u2019s pretty hard to draw any hard-and-fast conclusions,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats have said they will open the process for public hearings in a matter of weeks after the initial stage of their investigation concludes.\n\nFor the past month, Democrats have pursued an aggressive probe into whether Trump abused his office for personal and political gain. The inquiry began after a whistleblower from the intelligence community told Congress that Trump had sought to pressure the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2020 election by investigating Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have increasingly complained that defending Trump against those accusations is a herculean task made more difficult by the president\u2019s impromptu tweets and the lack of coordinated messaging at the White House. As current and former Trump administration officials have testified before the Intelligence Committee, with several backing up the whistle\u00adblower\u2019s allegations, Republicans have struggled to mount a coherent and consistent defense of the president.\n\nAD\n\nTheir responses have vacillated from complaints about the whistleblower\u2019s \u201csecondhand\u201d knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions to arguments that Democrats have not held a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry, which is not required under House rules.\n\nAfter Taylor\u2019s testimony, some GOP lawmakers argued that even if Trump held up the military aid for political reasons, it was defensible because the Ukrainian government did not initially know that the money had been stalled.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a quid pro quo with no quo,\u201d Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.) said Tuesday in a Fox News interview that Trump amplified on Twitter.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s top congressional allies, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), has repeatedly asked the White House for information as he has sought to defend the president, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 who spent Tuesday defending Trump\u2019s claim that the impeachment was a \u201clynching\u201d \u2014 has also criticized the White House\u2019s handling of the proceedings. Asked Wednesday whether the White House needed to do a better job of communicating on the impeachment inquiry, he said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe White House, which did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, has tried to take a more proactive role lately in coordinating with Hill Republicans, with limited success.\n\nTrump has complained in recent days that no one is forcefully defending him and convened with House Freedom Caucus lawmakers Tuesday at the White House before they barged into the secure room, according to lawmakers and aides familiar with the meeting. Trump told them to take more aggressive steps to block the investigation, these people said.\n\nAD\n\nHe has also sought more aides to go on TV and defend him. But the administration reversed course on hiring Trey Gowdy, who would have been a TV-heavy lawyer. Trump advisers say Rudy Giuliani has been asked to tone down his appearances in recent days and has done so. And many other aides are leery of going on TV because they do not know the facts, current and former administration officials said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are getting crushed right now,\u201d said a Trump adviser who has regularly spoken to the president in recent weeks.\n\nTurmoil within the West Wing has further complicated the impeachment response effort. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has faced calls for his ouster after a meandering news conference last week in which he undercut Trump\u2019s denials of a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for aid to Ukraine. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and the Justice Department both released statements distancing themselves from Mulvaney\u2019s comments, which the White House later sought to walk back.\n\nAD\n\nWhite House aides have complained that White House counsel Pat Cipollone has not shared information with others in the West Wing. Mulvaney and Cipollone have butted heads during the process, officials said.\n\nTrump has spearheaded his own impeachment defense, regularly confounding or undercutting his allies with incendiary tweets and statements.\n\nOn Wednesday \u2014 a day after forcing Republicans to respond to his lynching comparison \u2014 Trump turned his fire on Taylor, describing the career diplomat as a \u201cNever Trumper.\u201d He also acknowledged, however, that his own administration had chosen Taylor for the Ukraine posting.\n\n\u201cIt would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration, all well-meaning and good (I hope!), could stop hiring Never Trumpers, who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter. \u201cNothing good will ever come from them!\u201d\n\nFew Republicans have echoed Trump\u2019s personal attacks on Taylor, a Vietnam veteran who served in the government under Republican and Democratic presidents and was originally appointed ambassador to Ukraine by President George W. Bush. Taylor said in his testimony that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, had personally asked him to take the acting position this year.\n\nAt an event Wednesday in Pittsburgh, Trump said of Republicans: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stick together.\u201d\n\nHe gave Democrats backhanded praise, saying, \u201cThey stick together, and they\u2019re vicious.\u201d\n\nOn his way to the event, Trump wrote on Twitter that \u201cNever Trumper\u201d Republicans who don\u2019t support him are \u201chuman scum.\u201d He later apparently deleted the tweet.\n\nBrendan Buck, who was counselor to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said Trump\u2019s pressuring of GOP lawmakers to back him \u201cdespite the daily chaos\u201d has been effective because of his sway over Republican base voters.\n\n\u201cWhen Trump says Republicans in Congress aren\u2019t doing enough to defend him, their constituents quickly demand they stick by him,\u201d Buck said. \u201cAnd then those members demand that the leadership do more to protect him. And then you end up with stunts like we saw Wednesday.\u201d\n\nBut it is not clear that the strategy is working with the broader electorate, which has grown increasingly supportive of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 55 percent of voters voiced support for the impeachment inquiry, the highest level of support recorded in Quinnipiac surveys. Forty-three percent opposed the inquiry.\n\nIn the end, House Republicans\u2019 disruption of Wednesday\u2019s impeachment hearings also did little to derail the effort.\n\nAfter the long delay, the planned impeachment testimony of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper resumed inside the secure facility.", "description": "GOP lawmakers\u2019 defense of the president grew more frantic and disjointed a day after the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine implicated Trump in an abuse-of-power scheme.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0Snyczw6xGmPBT0AEgBWb2yk0AY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IBT2CMXV2AI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
