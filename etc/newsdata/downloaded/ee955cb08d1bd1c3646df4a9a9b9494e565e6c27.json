Gunfire can be heard in the background. A woman walks out, frantic.\n\n\u201cRelax, relax, show us your hands,\u201d says one of the officers.\n\nThen a young man in a button-down shirt and black baseball cap walks out, his hands in the air. Many Mexicans would have recognized him immediately: Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, a son of notorious drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. He had been indicted on a charge of drug trafficking in the United States months earlier.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe\u2019s told to put his hands on a wall, but then things quickly get strange. Guzm\u00e1n is asked to make a phone call.\n\n\u201cTell them to stop everything,\u201d says an officer.\n\nThe officer is referring to the chaos that had consumed Culiacan as Guzm\u00e1n was detained. The Sinaloa cartel, which has enormous power across the northwestern city, deployed like a military division that emerged from the ether to kidnap security personnel and burn buses.\n\nMexican security officials quickly realized they were being overpowered. They needed Guzm\u00e1n to call off his men. That was the idea behind the phone call he is seen making in the video.\n\n\u201cStop everything, stop everything. I turned myself in,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n says on the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to make a mess.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe guns were still pointed at him. That\u2019s where the video released at the morning news conference cuts off.\n\nAD\n\nNot long after the video was shot, the cartel continued to assert control of the city. The government released separate videos of armed men with rifles driving around Culiacan.\n\n\u201cThey were putting civilians at risk,\u201d Mexican Defense Secretary Luis Cresencio Sandoval said at the morning news conference.\n\nTo resolve the situation, security forces released Guzm\u00e1n back to the cartel \u2014 a deeply controversial peace offering intended to put an end to the day\u2019s violence. Guzm\u00e1n had been held for around three hours.\n\nOfficials attempted again Wednesday to justify his release.\n\nAD\n\nThe security personnel that participated in the operation would have defeated the cartel in a \u201cdeath match,\u201d but it would have caused significant bloodshed, said Alfonso Durazo, Mexico\u2019s secretary of public security.\n\nMexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ran for office on promises to address the root causes of organized crime, a strategy he has called \u201cabrazos, no balazos\u201d \u2014 hugs, not bullets. But violence has soared since he took office in December.\n\nAD\n\nDurazo argued that the botched operation in Culiacan should not be interpreted as proof that the government\u2019s broader security mission has failed.\n\n\u201cIn terms of security, it is not wise to overstate the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cA tactical stumbling block does not invalidate the security strategy as a whole.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSecurity analysts and former officials came away with a different impression. They saw an up-close look at the incompetence of those who planned the operation.\n\nRicardo Marquez, a former senior security official, said the new information being released by the Mexican government showed it didn\u2019t use many of the resources it had available \u2014 including helicopters and about 3,200 military and National Guard forces in the region.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredible they failed to show the Mexican government\u2019s capability,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "Officials again tried to justify the decision to release Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez as the Sinaloa cartel took over the city of Culiacan.", "authors": ["Kevin Sieff", "Latin America Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zsFR-RZWHxEL01z_qSA-ldJu9fg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PV74RJX3LQI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
