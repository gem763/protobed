A black widow bite", "language": "en", "text": "NEW YORK \u2014 The New York Yankees have been able to overcome a record-setting number of injuries this season in their quest to capture World Series title No. 28 \u2014 and the wildest injury of all didn\u2019t even happen to a player.\n\nPat Murtaugh, a pro scout with 30 years of experience, is currently advancing one of the other AL playoff hopefuls, trying to help the Yankees gain even the slightest edge should the two teams meet in October.\n\nGiven what happened to Murtaugh a few weeks ago, he\u2019s fortunate to still be preparing for the postseason.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAn urgent care trip revealed a surprising illness \u2014 caused by a black widow bite \u2014 that turned into emergency surgery, none of which stopped this Yankees scout from doing his job. Not even for a day. It\u2019s a story that proves just how dedicated baseball scouts are to their craft. Especially when the postseason is right around the corner.\n\nThe story starts in Arizona, in the third inning a minor-league game he was assigned to cover. Murtaugh, who turned 61 on Sunday, felt something on the inside of his left thigh.\n\n\u201cI just thought I\u2019d been standing too long, so I did some squats and stretched out a little bit,\u201d Murtaugh told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWhen I woke up the next day, I had a knot on the inside of my thigh, but there wasn\u2019t any discoloration or anything like that.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees have had set an MLB record for injuries this season, but this one is the strangest of them all. (Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images)\n\nMurtaugh visited with a team trainer who wasn\u2019t sure what it was \u2014 perhaps an insect bite. He then had it checked out in Phoenix, and the doctor there thought it might\u2019ve been a spider bite, \u201cbut it really hadn\u2019t discolored yet.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nMurtaugh flew to Tennessee to cover his next minor-league game featuring the Greeneville Reds \u2014 and his condition worsened significantly. His thigh now contained a really dark circle. He began to experience flu-like symptoms. His neck was stiff. His joints were achy. He woke up the following morning and felt horrible. The dark circle had gotten bigger. His wife told him he\u2019d better get it checked out.\n\nSo Murtaugh went to an urgent care in Kingsport, Tenn. And things escalated from there.\n\n\u201cThey took my blood right away, and then the doctor came in, put her gloves on and looked at my thigh,\u201d Murtaugh recounted. \u201cShe looked at it for about a minute and said, \u2018Sir, this is so deep in your tissue that I\u2019m not going to touch it. I\u2019m going to call a surgeon.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018What?!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe doctor came back five minutes later and asked if Murtaugh could do an outpatient surgery at 1 p.m. that day. He went to the hospital, filled out his forms and underwent a 45-minute surgery in which a surgeon numbed him from his hip down to his knee and cut out the infection \u2014 which contained venom.\n\nYes, Murtaugh was told he had been bitten by a black widow and was close to having a life-threatening bloodstream infection that can lead to organ failure.\n\n\u201cThe doctor told me things got worse with altitude when I was flying,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cI was close to becoming septic.\u201d\n\nOf course \u2014 being the gamer that he is \u2014 Murtaugh went right to the ballpark afterward his surgery was over and scouted a minor-league game later that night.\n\n\u201cMy leg was numb, but I felt fine physically because I didn\u2019t have the flu-like symptoms anymore,\u201d Murtaugh said. \u201cA lot of people think I was crazy, but that\u2019s just what scouts do. They keep on trucking.\u201d\n\nMurtaugh has since received a clean bill of health from his regular doctor in Indiana.\n\n\u201cIt ended up healing,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, it\u2019s probably as good as it\u2019s been.\u201d\n\n(Photo courtesy Pat Murtaugh)\n\nScouts across the country rack up frequent-flyer miles and Marriott points as they scour the country evaluating talent for their respective organizations. Murtaugh said that since July, he\u2019s been home about twice a month. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ve seen a game probably every day,\u201d he said.\n\nYankees GM Brian Cashman and other members of the front office including VP of baseball operations Tim Naehring and director of pro scouting Dan Giese have since reached out since the incident.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been really good to me,\u201d said Murtaugh, who is in his fourth season with the Yankees.\n\nAsked about his love of scouting, Murtaugh replied: \u201cFor one, you love the game. But more importantly, it\u2019s that competition to get players right, get players into your organization that can help you win championships.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many people involved in acquiring a player \u2014 from the analytics side to the team doctors \u2014 but it starts with the pro scout, and that\u2019s why we take pride in the (DJ) LeMahieu\u2019s that came here and all the different guys we got. That\u2019s the competition of getting a player right. You keep digging and find out about his makeup and whether he can handle New York City.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees \u2014 a model of sustainability given their ability to blend scouting and analytics in an effort to secure diamonds in the rough on the diamond \u2014 have managed to overcome their share of injuries, with the quest for their 28th World Series title about to begin for real.\n\nPat Murtaugh\u2019s injury was the most serious of them all \u2014 a black widow bite.\n\nYet he did what he thought any baseball scout would do after undergoing surgery.\n\nHe kept on trucking.\n\nThere was another player to find, another edge to be gained.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Yankees scout Pat Murtaugh details a scary ordeal in which he was bitten by a black widow, needed emergency surgery and didn't even miss a game", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/679LztSez.JISzrR9X_d6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDUuODY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nkGnxsLN0at8IT.xYXPILw--~B/aD0zMzYxO3c9NTA4MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/fcd71210-de3f-11e9-b656-d6374133a4d9", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
