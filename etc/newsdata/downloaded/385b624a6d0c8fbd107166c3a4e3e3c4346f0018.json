Esper, in Kabul on Sunday, said the cease-fire in northeastern Syria \u201cgenerally seems to be holding,\u201d despite reports of \u201cintermittent fire.\u201d He said the U.S. withdrawal was proceeding as planned.\n\nAD\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had threatened to resume a military offensive in northeastern Syria if Kurdish fighters didn\u2019t retreat from designated border areas by Tuesday evening, the deadline in the cease-fire pact.\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said they were keeping their end of the deal.\n\n\u201cAs part of the agreement to pause military operations with Turkey. . . . Today, we have evacuated the city of Ras al-Ayn,\u201d spokesman Kino Gabriel said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any more fighters in the city.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s offensive this month to rout Kurdish militants from the Syrian frontier has drawn international condemnation and set off a scramble for territory.\n\nAD\n\nVice President Pence traveled to Turkey last week to negotiate a halt to the fighting as U.S. troops stationed in northeastern Syria prepared to withdraw.\n\nSporadic clashes between the SDF and Turkish forces and their proxies in recent days in Ras al-Ayn, on the border with Turkey, threatened to undo the fragile agreement. Under the deal, Turkish forces would halt military operations for 120 hours to allow the SDF to retreat.\n\nAD\n\nTurkey said Sunday that it was monitoring the evacuation of Kurdish militants it views as terrorists for their links to the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state.\n\nAD\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry said Sunday that it had sent a 55-vehicle convoy to Ras al-Ayn. The ministry said a Turkish soldier was killed in an attack by Kurdish militants in Tal Abyad, about 75 miles west of Ras al-Ayn.\n\nEsper spoke to reporters traveling with him to Kabul, the Afghan capital.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. withdrawal continues apace from northeast Syria,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, we\u2019re talking weeks, not days.\u201d\n\nHe said U.S. troops departing from Syria would go to western Iraq, where they would have two missions.\n\n\u201cOne is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,\u201d he said. \u201cThings could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that\u2019s the game plan right now.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPelosi met with King Abdullah II and senior Jordanian officials Saturday night. Neither country released details of the talks until after the delegation departed for the United States on Sunday morning.\n\n\u201cWith the deepening crisis in Syria after Turkey\u2019s incursion, our delegation has engaged in vital discussions about the impact to regional stability, increased flow of refugees, and the dangerous opening that has been provided to ISIS, Iran and Russia,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nPelosi earlier called the cease-fire deal \u201ca sham\u201d that gave a pass to Turkey\u2019s offensive at the expense of the Kurds, a key ally in the recent fight against the Islamic State in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAbdullah \u201curged a political solution that safeguards Syria\u2019s territorial integrity and the unity of its people, while guaranteeing the safe and voluntary return of refugees,\u201d according to the state-run Petra news agency.\n\nAD\n\nCoverage of Pelosi\u2019s \u201cmiddle of the night\u201d meetings in the Jordanian press focused largely on concerns that Turkey\u2019s assault would result in the release of thousands of Islamic State fighters, many of them from Jordan, from Syrian prisons.\n\n\u201cThis visit comes at a crucial time of threats to stability in the region and the control of ISIS,\u201d the daily paper Al Ghad said.\n\nSome saw Pelosi\u2019s sudden appearance in Amman as a slap at Trump.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters what they talked about,\u201d said a former Israeli general, who asked not to be named because of his ties to the military. \u201cWhat matters is that she came here to draw a line under his abandonment of the Kurds and the outrage it has caused.\u201d\n\nTrump has said repeatedly that he wants to extract the United States from \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East. The decision to move U.S. forces from Syria to Iraq highlights the challenges of reaching that goal.\n\nAD\n\nThe administration has sent thousands of troops to the region since the spring. The Pentagon said this month that 1,800 would deploy to Saudi Arabia to deter Iranian aggression.\n\nTrump, who often praises Saudi Arabia as an important ally, said the kingdom \u201chas agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing to help them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northeast Syria, saying the president \u201cbelieves we\u2019ve accomplished a significant part of our mission and he wants our folks to come home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was about getting a cease-fire and secure area, that this in fact would save lives in that space,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThat was our mission set.\u201d\n\nAmanda Erickson and Tiffany Harness in Washington and Sarah Dadouch in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Both sides accused the other of violating the fragile agreement brokered by the United States.", "authors": ["Erin Cunningham", "Middle East Reporter Covering Iran", "Turkey", "Syria", "The Wider Region", "Steve Hendrix", "Jerusalem Bureau Chief Steve Hendrix Has Written For Foreign", "National", "Local", "Most Other Sections Of The Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ci01bulQBGEf2hD2wn_bzTjmcNU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7HYQIQXTLAI6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
