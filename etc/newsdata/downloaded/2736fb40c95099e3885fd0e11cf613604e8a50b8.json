Surv\u00e9 criticised the raid, calling it a \"fishing expedition\" and has threatened to sue both the regulator and the investigators who conducted the raid. The FSCA has said it would oppose any action.\n\nA spokesperson for Sekunajo said she had received Fin24's request for comment on Wednesday, and was working on a response. Comment will be added as soon as it is available.\n\n", "description": "In a note to clients, the accounting firm said the decision was made after \"careful consideration by our executive committee\".", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2787/bb64285bbdd94a01a6cfa2362450e27f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
