REUTERS/Jon Nazca\n\nDivisions over the secession drive that roiled Spain in 2017 have re-surfaced on the streets of the region\u2019s main city Barcelona since the Supreme Court sentenced nine politicians and activists to up to 13 years in jail.\n\nDespite calls for calm from the regional government, protesters blocked roads and train lines during the day and, after dark, set fire to cars. The regional Mossos police force said acid had been thrown at officers.\n\nIn some places, police charged at protesters and fired foam projectiles, Reuters witnesses said.\n\nActing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the government would act firmly and proportionately, and in concert with other political parties.\n\n\u201cThe Catalan people and all of Spanish society must know that the government is considering all scenarios,\u201d Sanchez told a news conference in Madrid.\n\nHe added that the government had set up a special commission including the national intelligence agency to advise it on how to manage the situation.\n\nSanchez will lead his Socialist Party to Spain\u2019s second election this year on Nov. 10 under pressure from right-wing parties to be tougher on Catalonia and take control of the region\u2019s security forces.\n\n\u201cSanchez must impose direct rule on Catalonia,\u201d said Albert Rivera, leader of liberal party Ciudadanos.\n\n\u201cVIOLENCE DOESN\u2019T REPRESENT US\u201d\n\nQuim Torra, the leader of the Catalan regional parliament, joined a demonstration earlier on Wednesday which blocked a road near the separatist stronghold of Girona. \u201cViolence doesn\u2019t represent us,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nCatalan interior affairs chief Miquel Buch told a news conference: \u201cThe defence of freedom does not require launching hard objects at police.\u201d\n\nSeveral thousand people, many of them young, congregated at sunset along a wide avenue in central Barcelona, waving pro-independence flags and throwing toilet paper in the air.\n\nIsaac Gra\u00f1a, an 18-year-old student, said he thought protesters had burned containers because peaceful protests since 2012 had not achieved their goals.\n\n\u201cMaking noise is the only way to make people pay attention to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Spain were a democratic state, people would not be jailed for wanting a vote,\u201d he added.\n\nA smaller demonstration in the capital Madrid resulted in one person being treated for minor injuries by paramedics, emergency services said.\n\nSince Torra\u2019s predecessor held a referendum banned by Spanish courts, Catalonia has been closely watched by other European countries, such as Scotland, where there are also movements for independence.\n\nMore than 4,000 companies have moved their headquarters out of Catalonia, including Catalan banks CaixaBank and Banco Sabadell.\n\nActing Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said on Wednesday growth in the euro zone\u2019s fourth-largest economy, which has been outperforming its neighbours, would have been faster were it not for the impact of the independence bid.\n\nLa Liga, Spain\u2019s top soccer league, asked the Spanish Football Federation to move a match scheduled between Barcelona and Real Madrid on Oct. 26 to Madrid because of the protests.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nSpain\u2019s Supreme Court issued a European arrest warrant on Monday for Catalonia\u2019s former leader, Carles Puigdemont, who lives in self-imposed exile in Belgium.\n\nThe Brussels prosecutor\u2019s office said on Wednesday it had received the request. Belgium rejected two earlier extradition requests and a spokeswoman for the prosecutor said it may take weeks to reach a decision on the new request.", "description": "Protesters clashed with police in the Spanish region of Catalonia on Wednesday, with some setting cars ablaze on the third day of disturbances caused by convictions handed down to leaders of a failed bid to declare an independent state.", "authors": ["Joan Faus", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441487617&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F16P", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
