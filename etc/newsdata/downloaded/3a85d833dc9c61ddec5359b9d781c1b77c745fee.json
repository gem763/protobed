The subpoenaed documents shall be part of the impeachment inquiry and shared among the Committees. Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House's impeachment inquiry.\"\n\n\"The Committees are investigating the extent to which President Trump jeopardized national security by pressing Ukraine to interfere with our 2020 election by withholding security assistance provided by Congress to help Ukraine counter Russian aggression,\" the letter continues.\n\nSecretary Pompeo just wrapped up the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, where he held a forum on religious freedom, met with allies about how to combat Iran and took on China for holding millions of innocent people in China.
