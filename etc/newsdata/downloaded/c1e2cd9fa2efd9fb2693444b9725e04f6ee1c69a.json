The graphics are lovely. The simple touch controls are fine once you get used to them. It\u2019s overflowing with colourful Nintendo brand polish. Mario Kart Tour is also a free-to-play game with a microtransaction-fuelled gacha collection mechanic and game options and rewards locked behind a paid monthly subscription. If that second part doesn\u2019t bother you, you might have a good time with Nintendo\u2019s latest mobile game.\n\n\u201cNintendo games still don\u2019t feel right on mobile,\u201d wrote Gita Jackson in late 2017, commenting on the strange dissonance felt while playing games like Fire Emblem Heroes, Super Mario Run and Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp after years playing the deeper console games in those series.\n\nTwo years later, after Dr. Mario World and now Mario Kart Tour, and that dissonance remains. Games we\u2019ve spent years playing on Nintendo consoles feel weird on phones and tablets. Especially when a game like Mario Kart gets turned on its side.\n\nIn part, I mean that literally. What an odd choice, taking a game we\u2019re used to playing in landscape mode and making it portrait. The narrow screen makes it more difficult to see competitors coming up alongside your racer. It\u2019s not a great view on my iPad. It\u2019s even worse on my skinnier iPhone. Having played the game for a couple of hours now, I still feel the urge to turn the whole thing around in my hands.\n\nI\u2019m used to holding down the accelerator button as I race through Mario Kart tracks. That\u2019s not what happens in Mario Kart Tour. Karts move forward automatically. All I have to do is tap left or right to steer (there\u2019s a gyroscope steering option but it\u2019s rubbish). It takes a while to get a feel for how and when to start drifting, and different kart models have their own handling profiles, but after four or five races it\u2019s not bad.\n\nAs alien as Mario Kart Tour can feel at first, it\u2019s not really the gameplay or screen orientation that makes it feel like the awkward cousin of a proper Mario Kart game. It\u2019s the structure. It\u2019s collecting stars awarded for achieving high scores in races to unlock new circuits. It\u2019s tracks where certain racers have distinct advantages over others. Musician Mario, one of the special racers available during the game\u2019s New York City-themed opening event, has a special power that grants him two Bob-ombs instead of one when he collects that power-up. Looking at his racer page, we can see which courses grant him three items per power-up box.\n\nCertain racers having a distinct advantage over others in certain situations isn\u2019t great. The game\u2019s gacha feature, in which players can spend in-game currency for a chance to unlock rare racers, means that players who pay more have a better chance at having the right racer, kart, and glider combo to get maximum bonus points on any course they play. That\u2019s verging on pay-to-win, even though there\u2019s no real-time multiplayer in the game \u2014 currently, players race against computer-controlled ghosts with real players\u2019 names attached to them.\n\nMario Kart Tour isn\u2019t quite as greedy as it was during beta. The test version of the game Ethan Gach played earlier this year had a stamina/energy metre, one of the most obnoxious free-to-play mechanics, as well as premium currency called green gems that offered players better rewards the more they purchased.\n\nThe launch version of the game lets you play all you want. The green gems are now rubies, and doesn\u2019t seem to reward you for buying more of them. Instead, there\u2019s a $7.99 monthly Gold Pass subscription that grants players better rewards for completing races (including extra rubies), exclusive vehicles and equipment, and access to more challenging 200cc races.\n\nIs an optional monthly subscription better than earning rewards for buying currency? Not really. Especially when Mario Kart Tour launched just days after Apple Arcade, a subscription service with more than 70 high-quality, microtransaction-free games for the same $7.99 price. Apple Arcade is mobile gaming without all the bullshit. Mario Kart Tour is a Nintendo game with a big extra helping of bullshit.\n\nAccording to app data website Apptopia, Mario Kart Tour shattered launch-day records yesterday, with more than 10.1 million installs across iOS and Android devices. The idea of a free Nintendo mobile game is an attractive prospect for many, many people. I wonder how long that will last.", "description": "Mario Kart Tour is a fine racing game.
