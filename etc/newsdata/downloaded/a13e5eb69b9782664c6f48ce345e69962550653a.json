Mr. Taylor worked as a congressional page before serving in the Army during the Korean War, where he started performing stand-up.\n\nAD\n\nHis ascent began with spots on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d where he was known as the \u201ccrying comedian.\u201d The moniker predated his television stints, however, and went back to his time in the Catskills.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI sat on a stool telling jokes, and nobody was laughing,\u201d he told United Press International in 1992. \u201cIn desperation, I pretended to cry as I begged them to laugh. That killed \u2019em.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s where he said the character \u201cRip\u201d came from.\n\nAlthough he readily admitted stealing jokes from USO shows, the crying comedian bit got him to Sullivan, where the host \u2014 forgetting Taylor\u2019s name \u2014 would say \u201cget me the crying comedian.\u201d\n\nMr. Taylor ended up on tour with Judy Garland and Eleanor Powell in Las Vegas in 1966.\n\nAD\n\nIn his more than five decades in entertainment, Mr. Taylor would make over 2,000 guest-star appearances on shows including \u201cThe Monkees,\u201d \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d \u201cLate Night with David Letterman,\u201d \u201cHollywood Squares\u201d and \u201cThe Gong Show.\u201d He also hosted the beauty pageant spoof \u201cThe $1.98 Beauty Show.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWith his bushy blond toupee, exaggerated eyebrows and walrus-like mustache, Mr. Taylor was a striking presence. He was apparently so proud of his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that he would regularly schedule trips to buff and clean the square at 6625 Hollywood Blvd.\n\nMr. Taylor also did a fair share of voice work for animated films and TV shows, such as \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d and \u201cThe Addams Family,\u201d which gained him an Emmy nomination for the voice of Uncle Fester.\n\nAD\n\nIn movies, he played himself in \u201cWayne\u2019s World 2\u201d and the \u201cJackass\u201d franchise.\n\nHe appeared onstage in \u201cAnything Goes,\u201d \u201cA Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\u201d and \u201cSugar Babies,\u201d where he took over for Mickey Rooney. He also appeared as Fagin in \u201cOliver!\u201d and Captain Hook in \u201cPeter Pan.\u201d Mr. Taylor also wrote and performed an autobiographical one-man play called \u201cIt Ain\u2019t All Confetti.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSurvivors include his longtime partner, Robert Fortney.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this obituary incorrectly reported Mr. Taylor was 84 or 85, depending on sources. He was 88, according to publicist Harlan Boll.
