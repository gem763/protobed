Mitt Romney, Utah Republican, told reporters that Mr. Trump\u2019s call with President Volodymyr Zelensky would be \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d if, as has been reported, the U.S. leader threatened to withhold military aid from Kiev unless it investigated former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cI think it would be very helpful to get the transcript,\u201d Mr. Romney said Monday, adding that Congress should get to see to judge the reports, which the White House disputes. \u201cAbsolutely let\u2019s see the transcript.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has acknowledged talking about Mr. Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, with Mr. Zelensky but denies making threats or other inappropriate action.\n\n\u201cWhat has been alleged by some news sources is that the president asked for an investigation into Mr. Biden. That would be in my view very inappropriate and a very serious allegation itself, so let\u2019s find out what exactly what was said,\u201d Mr. Romney said Monday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
