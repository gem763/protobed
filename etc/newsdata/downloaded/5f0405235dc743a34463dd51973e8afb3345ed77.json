Atlanta\u2019s 19th division title tied the New York Yankees for the most since Major League Baseball split into divisions for the 1969 season.\n\nAtlanta\u2019s win ensured it will finish ahead of second-place Washington and will start the NL Division Series at home on Oct. 3, most likely against the NL Central champion.\n\nBraves players ran onto the infield to celebrate as soon as Acu\u00f1a caught Alex Dickerson\u2019s game-ending flyout.\n\nAtlanta (95-60) moved into sole possession of first place for good on June 12. Led by Acu\u00f1a, Freddie Freeman, Josh Donaldson and a offense that produced a franchise-best 241 homers, its lead swelled from 5\u00bd to 10 games in six days ending with a 9-4 home win over Washington on Sept. 7.\n\nThe Braves, who have not won a postseason series since 2001, secured a playoffs berth last week and needed a few extra days to clinch the division. They lost three in a row for the first time since July 16-18 but have won two straight.\n\nCARDINALS 2, CUBS 1\n\nCHICAGO (AP) - Yadier Molina had three of St. Louis\u2019 four hits, including a two-run single, and the Cardinals held off the fading Chicago.\n\nCarlos Martinez got the final two outs, and the Cardinals stretched their NL Central lead to 3 1/2 games over Milwaukee and five games over Chicago. The Cubs are 1 1/2 games behind the Brewers for the second NL wild card, with Milwaukee set to play later Friday against Pittsburgh.\n\nChicago has totaled nine runs while losing its past four games. The Cardinals have won the first two games of this key four-game set, and they\u2019ll play the Cubs five more times over their final eight games.\n\nThe Cubs scored their run following a St. Louis error in the second inning, and the Cardinals rallied in the sixth.\n\nDavid Phelps (2-1), the second of eight Cubs relievers, took the loss.\n\nRyan Helsley pitched a scoreless fifth and was awarded the win.\n\nINDIANS 5, PHILLIES 2\n\nCLEVELAND (AP) - Carlos Carrasco got his first save in five years, and Cleveland beat Philadelphia to maintain position for the second AL wild card and damage the Phillies\u2019 playoff chances.\n\nCleveland (91-63) began the night tied with Tampa Bay for the second wild card, two games behind Oakland. The Indians were four games behind AL Central-leading Minnesota.\n\nPhiladelphia began the night three games behind Milwaukee for the second NL wild card and lost for the fourth time in six games.\n\nAll-Star MVP Shane Bieber (15-7) allowed two runs and seven hits in 7 1/3 innings with seven strikeouts and no walks.\n\nRookie Oscar Mercado had RBI singles in the first and seventh. Yasiel Puig, Francisco Lindor and Carlos Santana also drove in runs, helping Cleveland to its fifth straight win\n\nDrew Smyly (4-7) allowed four runs, five hits and three walks in two-plus innings.\n\nMETS 8, REDS 1\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) - Pete Alonso hit his major league-leading 50th home run, Jacob deGrom pitched shutout ball for seven innings and New York beat Cincinnati.\n\nAmed Rosario hit a two-run homer and Jeff McNeil added a solo shot for the Mets, who opened the day 3 1/2 games behind Milwaukee for the second NL wild card. The Brewers hosted Pittsburgh on Friday night.\n\nCincinnati rookie Aristides Aquino led off the ninth with a homer. The midseason call-up has 17 home runs in 49 games this season.\n\nDeGrom (10-8) struck out nine and didn\u2019t walk anybody to match his win total from last season, when he won the NL Cy Young Award.\n\nLuis Castillo (15-7) struck out seven and walked three in seven innings.\n\nNATIONALS 6, MARLINS 4\n\nMIAMI (AP) - Trea Turner hit two solo homers as Washington beat Miami.\n\nWashington had dropped four of six. It began the day with a one-game lead over Milwaukee for the top spot in the NL wild-card standings.\n\nThe Marlins became the third team to lose 100 games this season, joining the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers. Miami also had 100-loss seasons in 1998 and 2013.\n\nBefore the game, the Marlins announced manager Don Mattingly had agreed to a two-year contract extension. Mattingly was in the final year of a four-year contract.\n\nThe Nationals grabbed the lead for good on Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s three-run homer off Robert Dugger (0-3) in the fourth inning.\n\nORIOLES 5, MARINERS 3\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) - F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez labored through five innings in what was likely his penultimate start with Seattle, and Baltimore got home runs from Anthony Santander and Hanser Alberto in the win.\n\nAfter rookie Kyle Lewis hit a two-run homer in the first inning, Hern\u00e1ndez (1-7) gave the lead back in the bottom half after throwing just eight pitches.\n\nThe Mariners never recovered.\n\nAaron Brooks (6-8) threw seven innings of one-hit ball in relief of opener Richard Bleier to help the Orioles end Seattle\u2019s five-game winning streak.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez needed 91 pitches to get 15 outs. His line included five runs, eight hits two walks and two wild pitches.\n\nBLUE JAYS 4, YANKEES 3\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Star second baseman Gleyber Torres prompted an audible gasp from the Yankee Stadium crowd when his right leg buckled while fielding a grounder and made an early exit in New York\u2019s loss to Toronto.\n\nTorres said his lower legs felt weakness.\n\nAaron Judge and Tyler Wade homered for the Yankees a day after they clinched the division.\n\nJustin Smoak hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the seventh to help Toronto match a season high with its fifth straight victory. He connected off Tommy Kahnle (3-2) as the Yankees\u2019 bullpen wobbled in the late innings for the third time in a week.\n\nDanny Jansen also homered for the Blue Jays. Jason Adam (2-0) won in relief and Ken Giles closed for his 21st save in 22 chances.\n\nWHITE SOX 10, TIGERS 1\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Eloy Jim\u00e9nez hit a grand slam in the fourth inning, and Yo\u00e1n Moncada also went deep as Chicago breezed past Detroit.\n\nTim Anderson had two more hits in his pursuit of the American League batting title, and the White Sox chased Jordan Zimmermann (1-12) in the fourth.\n\nDylan Cease (4-7) allowed a run and five hits in six innings - the first quality start for the White Sox since Sept. 6. Cease struck out eight with two walks.\n\nZimmerman allowed nine runs and 11 hits in 3 2/3 innings.\n\nJim\u00e9nez finished a double shy of the cycle, and Yolmer Sanchez had four hits for Chicago.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Atlanta Braves clinched their second straight NL East title as Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. hit his 41st homer in a 6-0 win over San Francisco on Friday night that eliminated the Giants from postseason contention in Bruce Bochy's last year as San Francisco manager.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/aptopix_giants_braves_baseball_77316_c0-870-2160-2129_s1770x1032.jpg?6df1338554c5a1f9d057ee3a6af55a984a16e8cc", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
