Before his improbable rise, Mr. Zelensky didn\u2019t know who Rudy Giuliani was, according to one aide. By now, though, Mr. Zelensky sensed trouble. In an April 7 appearance on Fox News, the former New York City mayor had made it clear he wanted information about his client\u2019s political rival, Joe Biden, and his family.\n\nMr. Zelensky, fearful of getting sucked into a foreign drama when he had plenty at home, declined to take the meeting.\n\nHe got sucked in anyway. Over the next several months, Mr. Zelensky\u2019s administration tried to sort through conflicting signals from Washington that have now become central to an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump.
