The Instagram handles used reportedly used the names of the Parkland shooter and the infamous serial killer Ted Bundy. Fleury used these accounts to repeatedly \"taunt\" the families and friends of Parkland victims who he considered to be \"activists,\" according to court documents viewed by NBC News.\n\n\"Your grief is my joy,\" Fleur reportedly wrote in one message viewed by the Sun-Sentinel. \"I killed your loved ones, hahaha.\"\n\nparkland shooting memorial More\n\nAssociated Press/Wilfredo Lee\n\nFlorida officials traced the messages of the multiple accounts back to a single IP Address in Santa Ana, where Fleury was living with his father and his brother at the time. Since Fleury's victims were located across the country the 21-year-old was ultimately charged with one count of transmitting a kidnapping threat, in addition to three counts of cyberstalking.\n\nThe jury's decision came after a six-day trial in Fort Lauderdale. An assistant public defender attempted to argue that Fleury has a form of autism that prevented him from understanding the fear his 301 messages evoked, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\n\n\"He [Fleury] did not understand that these people were afraid,\" Fleury's federal public defender Daryl Wilcox said according to the Sun-Sentinel. Fleury's father reportedly took the stand and echoed the autism defense. That argument fell on deaf ears with Florida prosecutors arguing that Fleury was well aware of the hurt and pain he caused by that he, \"just doesn't feel it.\"\n\nFleury is scheduled for sentencing on December 2. He faces up to 20 years in federal prison.\n\nNOW WATCH: How Area 51 became the center of alien conspiracy theories", "description": "\u201cYour grief is my joy,\u201d the cyberstalker reportedly wrote in one message viewed by the Sun-Sentinel. \u201cI killed your loved ones, hahaha.\u201d", "authors": ["Mack Degeurin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KB5WKHXA0kF5i3JZfBySgA--~B/aD0xMjg0O3c9MTcxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/insider_articles_922/8b0298f19e74a2091367bc8394b460cc", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
