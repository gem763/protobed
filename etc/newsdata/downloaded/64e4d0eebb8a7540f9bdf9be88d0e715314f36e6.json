We chose them based on the breadth of their roles and responsibilities, and their influence on company performance and the industry.\n\nThe list encompasses a range of streaming companies, including AVOD players like Tubi, ad-supported streaming TV services like Pluto TV; niche services that have corner a segment of the ad-supported video market like Revry; tech companies that are playing in the video space, like Twitter; and media companies that have been strategic in programming for these platforms, like Viacom Digital Studios.\n\nThe list does not include executives at ad-supported services like Hulu or ESPN Plus that also charge subscription fee.
