We\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks a couple of the games that have been stopped in Italy and where the referee made an \u00adannouncement to the crowd.\n\n\u201cThe next stage is that it would be stopped and the referee takes the players off the pitch.\n\n\u201cAnd the third step would be an abandonment of the game.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThat is the process now \u2013 and we are very clear across all of our staff about what would need to happen if there is any sign of racist abuse. We have an official \u00adposition to report something if we hear it.\u201d\n\nThe game will be played in front of a reduced crowd after UEFA \u00adordered the Bulgarian FA to close a 5,000-seat section of the 44,000-capacity stadium as a \u00adpunishment for the abuse meted out to players during the Kosovo and Czech Republic qualifiers.\n\nSouthgate\u2019s squad will get a \u00adsecurity briefing when they meet up at St George\u2019s Park tomorrow ahead of Friday\u2019s game in the Czech Republic.\n\nSouthgate added: \u201cIt\u2019s important to pick it up with the players. We have had two home games since the Montenegro match.\n\n\u201cIn Montenegro, a couple of the players were aware of something in the first half \u2013 but lots weren\u2019t.\n\n\u201cEven at the end of the game, I was very aware of what happened but some on the bench didn\u2019t hear.\n\n\u201cWe all hope we\u2019re not \u00addiscussing this again at the end of the game in Sofia \u2013 but it\u2019s important that our players are prepared.\u201d", "description": "Bulgarian fans have previously targeted Kosovo and Czech Republic players this summer and the FA have put Gareth Southgate on red alert", "authors": ["Simon Mullock", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469364.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Gareth-Southgate-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
