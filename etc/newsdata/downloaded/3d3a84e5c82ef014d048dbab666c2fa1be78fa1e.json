(Picture: Apple)\n\nJason Momoa is taking on much more than leading the Dothraki for his latest venture SEE, he\u2019s carrying the launch of an entire streaming service on his notoriously chiseled back in Apple TV+ and, we cannot stress this enough, if anyone can mend the wounds of Game of Thrones\u2019 final season it\u2019s the star they let off too soon.\n\nSee\u2019s premise is ambitious, to say the least, and with good reason \u2013 there\u2019s a lot riding on its success. To set the scene: Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight\u2019s story jumps 400 years to the future after a virus has wiped out the Earth\u2019s population with the exception of 2 million people, marking a scarcely medieval new start.\n\nOnly, those \u2018fortunate\u2019 to have survived the cull emerged without their sight. In fact, vision has not only become something of the past it\u2019s become folklore. Until two children, born to an elusive stranger rumoured to be the only human with sight, are born to a community \u2013 The Alkeny \u2013 putting its people in grave danger from all those desperate to snatch the babies.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nFrom there, Momoa\u2019s Baba Voss leads the pack as a warrior with a dark past, who takes it upon himself to raise the children and protect their secret before they hunt down their biological father and start building the new world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, inevitably, there are perilous obstacles standing in his way. The twins are a prime target for lurking vultures, most notably the barbaric Queen Kane played by Sylvia Hoaks, who is among the many highlights of the series \u2013 as mesmerising as she is genuinely haunting.\n\nApple TV+ release See\u2019s first three instalments this week \u2013 three hours of unbroken tension. While Game of Thrones comparisons are somewhat inevitable \u2013 even if Momoa desperately wants you to overlook them \u2013 See does show promise of reaching the extraordinary heights of HBO\u2019s once pinnacle of epic television.\n\nSylvia Hoaks is mesmerising as Queen Kane (Picture: AppleTV)\n\nWith a $15 million (\u00a311.6 million) budget, See is the first spectacle worthy of being uttered in the same breath of GOT. The battle sequences are extraordinary \u2013 within a matter of minutes a merciless bloodbath sets the tone of what\u2019s ahead: blockbuster sequences with no-holds barred, a punch in the gut for the faint-hearted, beautifully choreographed with Momoa largely, and successfully, leading the way.\n\nWhile we\u2019re not seeing Momoa branching out too far from the familiarity of Khal Drogo or Aquaman, in See the 40-year-old shares a closer resemblance to the puppy-loving doting father that continues to \u2018break\u2019 Instagram daily and openly sobs to The Lion King, because who doesn\u2019t? While he\u2019s proved himself as a natural at slicing the odd limb off his foe as a millennial answer to Arnold Schwarzenegger time and time again, almost a decade since the notoriously one dimensional Drogo was killed off, Momoa finally gets to serve some of his chops.\n\nSee will be Jason Momoa\u2019s legacy (Picture: Apple)\n\nThere\u2019s still elements of the grunty primal hero we\u2019ve become accustomed to, but Momoa also proves he can carry a sincerity we\u2019ve not seen before. Though, he far from carries See on his own. Alfre Woodard \u2013 who\u2019s among the frontrunners for a 2020 Oscar \u2013 is captivating as Paris, arguably Vas\u2019s number two in command and fierce protector of his children, while Hoaks\u2019 performance as the wild mad queen should, and more than likely will be, talked about in years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a concept, on paper See seems absurd, but makes perfect sense when executed \u2013 even if on occasions the survivors\u2019 blindness is suspicious at best, often totally unbelievable. Not that watching Momoa slaughter a bear and an entire army with questionable ease takes away from its enjoyment whatsoever though.\n\nImmediately See feels accomplished. Almost as soon as it\u2019s begun there\u2019s a comfortability to Knight\u2019s vision of a blind dystopia, where the well-publicised sell of a population without their sight is swiftly forgotten and the constant threat of danger, which never falters, makes for a consistently thrilling watch.\n\nWhile millions will no doubt come for Jason Momoa, everything about See is worth staying for. I\u2019ve already devoured the first three episodes twice and there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll gobble them up again before Friday.\n\nSee episodes one, two and three will be available to stream on AppleTV+ from November 1. The rest of season one will be released weekly.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
