That sealed the deal for anyone who had any questions about her,\u201d said Knissel, a union officer for the United Mine Workers of America who said he won\u2019t support Trump in 2020, but worries the current 2020 Democrats are repeating past mistakes. \u201cThey\u2019re pro-union, but anti-coal. They say, \u2018We\u2019ll support you, but we\u2019ll just find you another occupation,\u2019 and that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign hopes to seize on that kind of discomfort among disaffected workers \u2014 whether coal miners or striking General Motors employees \u2014 in its bid for reelection. The president found Reagan-like support with blue-collar workers in 2016, but needs to further dominate the union vote next fall to compensate for the suburban slump he\u2019s already facing. Right now, he is banking on a strong economy to do that \u2014 saying current economic conditions preserve jobs that might otherwise be threatened by automation and environmental regulations under a Democratic administration \u2014 even as many of the workers he\u2019s after are suffering through a manufacturing slowdown under the weight of his trade war.\n\nIf Trump fails, allies fear his popularity in the Rust Belt will crumble, triggering a cascade of losses across the industrial Midwest that can only be offset by victories in Florida and an unusual collection of traditionally blue states.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t win Florida, the race is over. And if we win Pennsylvania, the race is over because the reality is if Pennsylvania goes for Trump, you\u2019re going to see others break his way,\u201d said an official with America First, the premier outside group backing Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

At his campaign rallies, Trump will turn up the pressure on Congress to pass his North American trade deal after months of leaving the heavy lifting to Vice President Mike Pence. The agreement, known as the USMCA, has so far been met with mixed reaction among organized labor, where concerns about its enforceability remain a top concern.\n\nIn their own attempt to help the president connect with union workers, White House officials recently stepped into discussions around the United Auto Workers walkout against General Motors \u2014 the first time the company has faced a major strike in more than a decade. Top Trump officials are pushing for a deal that would reopen a GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, as POLITICO first reported Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want General Motors building plants outside of this country,\u201d Trump told reporters a day earlier.\n\nOthers close to Trump\u2019s reelection operation said the locations of his upcoming rallies will also reflect a push to broaden his appeal among workers in the construction, electrical, manufacturing and mining industries.\n\nIn Ohio, where about 640,000 workers belonged to unions last year, Trump advisers have sought advice from former campaign official and ex-Republican National Committee co-chair Bob Paduchik on where the president should appear to maximize his outreach to union households, according to a person familiar with those conversations. Paduchik did not respond to requests for comment, but wrote in a Labor Day op-ed for the conservative outfit Townhall that union members were \u201ccritical\u201d to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and his campaign \u201cwill devote the time, energy, resources and attention to expand the coalition of rank and file union members who know a good job when they see one.\u201d\n\nMuch of the Trump campaign\u2019s effort to charm American workers over the next year is driven by its belief that the Democratic party\u2019s shift in a more progressive direction has placed its long-standing relationship with the labor movement on the brink of collapse.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend some labor leaders have recognized and warned Democrats about, urging them to take a more tactful approach to issues like trade, healthcare and climate change, and to painstakingly address the economic impacts of major policy proposals like the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cClimate change and economic inequality are the two greatest threats to our way of life. Any solution for one also has to address the other. We have to do both, and we have to make sure working families are invested in that solution,\u201d said John Weber, spokesman for the AFL-CIO.\n\nAFL-CIO president Richard Trumka put it more bluntly in a letter this spring to both sponsors of the controversial climate-change resolution: \u201cWe will not accept proposals that could cause immediate harm to millions of our members and their families. We will not stand by and allow threats to our members\u2019 jobs and their families\u2019 standard of living go unanswered.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats have worked hard to ingratiate themselves with rank-and-file union members, instead of just courting their bosses. Their main goal: avoid a repeat of 2016, when Clinton carried union households by 9 points over Trump \u2014 a narrow margin when compared to the 20- and 18-point leads Barack Obama held in 2008 and 2012.\n\nBiden, for instance, declared himself \u201ca union man\u201d during his first campaign rally of the cycle, which was hosted by the International Association of Fire Fighters. He has also distanced himself from his proposals by his opponents to end private health insurance or shift to a single-payer system, casting both moves as anti-labor and disruptive to hundreds of thousands of union members who have tirelessly negotiated their current benefits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been listening to a lot of folks in labor who have said to me, \u2018Look, we negotiated contracts where we\u2019ve given up wages for these health care benefits, and under the Medicare for All plan, we would lose them or we would be certainly in fear of losing them,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), another 2020 contender, told voters at a labor forum in Nevada.\n\nHarris\u2019 vacillations on health care have drawn repeated attention from the Trump campaign and other Republican critics. But it's Biden\u2019s comfortable support among the union crowd and his resulting strength in the Rust Belt \u2014 a Marquette Law School poll this month found the former vice president trouncing Trump 51 to 42 percent in Wisconsin \u2014 that most worries the president, according to one outside adviser who spoke with Trump recently.\n\nThe president was \u201capoplectic\u201d when Biden nabbed the endorsement of the firefighters union and doesn\u2019t want it to happen again before the Democrats select their nominee, this adviser said, adding that in the immediate aftermath of the Biden endorsement, Trump bragged to confidants that he\u2019s capable of getting other unions to support him if he wants to.\n\nBut of the two unions that backed Trump in 2016 \u2014 the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Border Patrol Council \u2014 one hadn\u2019t endorsed a candidate since President Bill Clinton ran for reelection in 1996, and the other broke with a longstanding policy against endorsements to support him.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons why those close to the president\u2019s campaign dismissed Trump\u2019s claim as improbable.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would expect him to get any unions,\u201d said another Trump adviser. \u201cThe problem is, even when the rank-and-file supports the president, the union bosses are all hardcore Democrats.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

Promises to reform health care and pass historic infrastructure legislation have languished as the president has largely concentrated on immigration and plunged headfirst into culture-war politics. Trump\u2019s union critics have also accused him of weakening collective bargaining rights, while propping up anti-union personalities. For instance, his latest nominee for Labor secretary, Eugene Scalia, was described by SEIU official Kyle Bragg as \u201can appalling joke made at the expense of working people everywhere.\u201d\n\nCombine those concerns with mounting fears of an economic downturn and critics say Trump is going to have a tough time convincing union households that he\u2019s their guy.\n\nFor that reason, his 2020 campaign will ensure its workers coalition \u2014 which will join three other grassroots groups already focused on women, Latinos and African Americans \u2014 is sending union members \u201cback into their communities and their neighborhoods to spread the word\u201d about the president's positive accomplishments, according to a senior Trump campaign official.\n\nAsked how they plan to convince union members, whose bosses generally oppose Trump, to join the coalition, the same official said, \u201cThey just will. I don\u2019t know how they will convince people to do it, but I know that there are people who are willing to do it just because they believe in the president so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean every single union member that agrees to support the president has to have his or her name on a list, or be publicly identified,\u201d the official added.\n\nKnissel, the West Virginia union member, won\u2019t be voting for Trump in 2020 no matter who comes knocking. The president\u2019s inflammatory comments about immigrants are too much for him, and he\u2019s disappointed in the administration\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate the coal industry.\n\n\u201cWith what I see every day in the news, I just can\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. \u201cOur union was formed in 1890 and it was with people from all walks of life \u2014 Italians, Croatians, African Americans. Immigrants came together to form this union.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you look at the rank-and-file membership,\u201d Knissel continued, \u201cthey\u2019re really just looking for somebody \u2014 anybody \u2014 who saves them [and] saves their jobs.\u201d", "description": "The president\u2019s 2020 campaign wants to capitalize on discomfort among disaffected workers \u2014 if they can look past a manufacturing slowdown under the weight of Trump\u2019s trade war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/2e/7c/b2f437e041139d8de494cec80504/190917-trump-union-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
