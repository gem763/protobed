(Photo by Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)\n\nA Notre Dame-USC game that got testy at halftime ended in controversy on Saturday, as officials somehow failed to notice a wildly gesturing, presumably screaming man that was jumping up and down on the field during a game-deciding onside kick attempt for the Trojans.\n\nThe man in question: Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLololol when your coach doesn\u2019t give a damn pic.twitter.com/i5CzI8uobG \u2014 Warren Sharp (@SharpFootball) October 13, 2019\n\nThe onside-kick attempt came after a Markese Stepp touchdown that cut Notre Dame\u2019s lead to three points at 30-27. With Kelly on the field, USC attempted to get the ball back with a minute left in the game, but were unable to recover the ball.\n\nUnlike the officials, USC head coach Clay Helton did notice Kelly on the field and asked if the play was reviewable after it didn\u2019t go his team\u2019s way.\n\nClay Helton on Brian Kelly being on the field for the onside kick: \u201cShould have been a flag. No question.\u201d\n\n\n\nHelton said that he was asking the referees if the play was reviewable. \u2014 Keely Eure (@keelyismyname) October 13, 2019\n\nHad an official noticed Kelly, USC likely would have gotten another attempt at kicking the ball, but alas. Such is life with a Pac-12 officiating crew.\n\nThanks to a massive day on the ground from running back Tony Jones Jr. and company (308 rushing yards), No. 9 Notre Dame survived the comeback scare from USC. The Irish will now head into a bye week with another rivalry game at Michigan on tap for Oct. 26.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Brian Kelly was wildly gesturing and jumping up and down on the field during USC's failed onside kick attempt.
