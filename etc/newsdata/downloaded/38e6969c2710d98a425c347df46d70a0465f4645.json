President Trump\u2019s administration, however, adopted the view that the waivers give states the option to create plans circumventing Obamacare.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer announced Monday that Democrats would demand a vote on a resolution overturning the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cThis week, the Senate will hold one of the most significant votes of the year: we will finally see where Republicans stand on the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to sabotage the health care of millions of Americans with preexisting conditions,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement. \u201cIt is preposterous that the Trump administration claims to care about preserving preexisting condition protections for millions of Americans while simultaneously peddling shoddy, substandard junk plans that undermine and weaken those very protections.\u201d\n\nThe New York Democrat challenged his Republican colleagues to, \u201c[S]tand up to the sabotage or stop swindling the American people with your empty promises of support for protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nThe Senate Democrats\u2019 effort to undo the Trump administration\u2019s approach to health care is part of a larger strategy to systematically undermine the Trump administration\u2019s agenda from the Senate.\n\nLast week, Democrats deployed a similar procedural move to undo a component of the tax reform legislation signed into law by Mr. Trump in 2017. The Democrats\u2019 resolution to change the cap on deductions for state and local taxes failed last week along mostly partisan lines.\n\nDemocrats said they intend to force a vote on the Obamacare waivers as soon as Wednesday.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
