The relative quiet came after a volatile day for European stocks on Thursday, when the ECB unveiled a long-awaited package of stimulus measures, including an interest-rate cut and a renewed program of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing.\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index rallied 1% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei was up 1.1%. Markets in China, Korea and Taiwan were closed for a holiday.\n\nMoritz Sterzinger, a director at financial-advisory firm JCRA, flagged concerns that further quantitative easing might have limited impact on growth and inflation, given that interest rates are in negative territory.\n\nHe questioned: \u201cHow big are the these diminishing returns to monetary stimulus, and how effective are additional rate cuts and another round of quantitative easing going to be in terms of stimulating the economy?\u201d\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe on Friday were Italy\u2019s Unione di Banche Italiane, known as UBI Banca , which was up 2.8% and Germany\u2019s Commerzbank , which gained 3.3%.\n\nThe ECB also set plans on Thursday for a new two-tiered system for charging interest on the deposits held by eurozone banks, in an effort to ease some of the losses lenders face as rates dip further into negative territory.\n\nOn the trade front, The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing was making efforts to narrow the scope of negotiations with the U.S., separating issues like national security that have held up the talks. That came after President Trump on Wednesday postponed new tariffs that were set to be imposed on $250 billion of Chinese imports from Oct. 1.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys rose to 1.802%, from 1.789% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Aug. 5, 2019.
