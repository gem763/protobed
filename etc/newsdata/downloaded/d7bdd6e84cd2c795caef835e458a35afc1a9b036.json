Mandatory Credit: Troy Taormina-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Rockets\u2019 general manager, Daryl Morey, apologised on Monday for the tweet he swiftly deleted on the weekend, but his support for the protests in the Chinese-ruled city angered Beijing, Chinese fans and the team\u2019s partners in a key NBA market.\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey tweeted on Monday.\n\n\u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event,\u201d he said, adding that he had since heard and considered other perspectives.\n\nThe Rockets are widely followed in China, partly because they drafted Yao Ming in 2002, who became a star and helped build the NBA\u2019s following there.\n\nMorey\u2019s initial tweet included an image captioned: \u201cFight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nIt prompted sportswear brand Li-Ning and sponsor Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD Bank) Credit Card Center to suspend work with the Rockets, while the team\u2019s games were dropped by China\u2019s state broadcaster.\n\nThe post was later deleted and 47-year-old Morey, the NBA\u2019s executive of the year in 2018, said his views did not represent the team or league.\n\nIn a separate statement, the NBA said \u201cwe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese-language version issued by the NBA appeared to go further than the English statement, saying: \u201cWe are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey.\u201d\n\nThe NBA added, \u201cwe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\u201d\n\nU.S. lawmakers said the NBA\u2019s response was shameful and showed how China was using its economic power to censor speech by Americans in the United States. [L3N26S0KS]\n\n\u201cAs a lifelong @HoustonRockets fan, I was proud to see @dmorey call out the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s repressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong,\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, said on Twitter. \u201cNow, in pursuit of $$, the @NBA is shamefully retreating.\u201d\n\nOther legislators accused the NBA, no stranger to American politics, of a double standard when it comes to China.\n\nNBA stars and some coaches have been outspoken in their criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has urged players to speak out on issues of concern, including questions of police brutality and gun violence.\n\nWhen LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and other players warmed up for games in \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d t-shirts in 2014 to protest the arrest that led to the death of an unarmed black man in New York, the league did not impose fines. James, the NBA\u2019s biggest star, endorsed Hillary Clinton and campaigned for her in 2016.\n\n\u201cAnd the #NBA, which (correctly) has no problem with players/employees criticizing our gov\u2019t, is now apologizing for criticizing the Chinese gov\u2019t. This is shameful and cannot stand,\u201d New Jersey Congressman Tom Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.\n\nThe Rockets are in Japan for a preseason exhibition against the Toronto Raptors. Star player James Harden said after a practice on Monday the controversy had not affected the players.\n\n\u2018LONG TIME TO REPAIR\u2019\n\nThe furore is the latest example of an overseas brand caught in controversy over the protests, which have plunged Hong Kong into its worst political crisis in decades and pose a major challenge to Beijing.\n\nMany Western fashion brands, including Spain\u2019s Zara, have been forced to clarify positions on Chinese sovereignty as the Hong Kong protests fuel nationalist fervour.\n\nChinese internet users in August blacklisted bubble tea brands from Taiwan after a Hong Kong franchise urged solidarity with protesters.\n\nJoseph Tsai, owner of the Brooklyn Nets and co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, said the damage from Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cwill take a long time to repair.\u201d\n\nSportswear brand Li-Ning said on Sunday it had stopped working with the Rockets and wanted \u201ca clear answer on this matter.\u201d\n\nSPD Bank also suspended cooperation with the team, and state broadcaster CCTV\u2019s sports channel has dropped Rockets games. On Sunday night, Tencent also said it would temporarily stop streaming Rockets games.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association, chaired by former Rockets star Yao, said it was suspending \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the team.\n\nHu Xijin, the editor of the state-controlled Global Times newspaper, tweeted on Monday that Morey \u201chas the right to express his values, and Chinese fans of the Houston Rockets have the right to abandon this team. If the Rockets want to keep its Chinese market, the team need to avoid offending Chinese public.\u201d\n\nCCTV, in the first reporting on the controversy by state media, said Morey\u2019s apology on Twitter did not go far enough.\n\nMorey said in those tweets that he \u201calways appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention.\u201d\n\nSome Chinese fans called for a boycott of the Rockets.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cI watched the Rockets for 21 years, but I\u2019m still a Chinese person first and foremost,\u201d one social media user said.\n\nChina\u2019s consulate in Houston said on Sunday it \u201cmade stern representations to the Rockets and requested them to clarify, to immediately correct any mistakes, and to eliminate any negative influences.\u201d", "description": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) came under fire on Monday for its response to a tweet by a Houston Rockets official in support of Hong Kong protests for democracy, the latest overseas business to run afoul of political issues in China.", "authors": ["Josh Horwitz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437911665&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF950FK", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
