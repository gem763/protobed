We also need a royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin to get to the bottom of this mismanagement.\n\n\u201cDams are not the answer and they are definitely not a drought policy. If the federal government really wants to help farmers and ensure the sustainability of our food bowl, they\u2019ll start by getting a climate policy and cleaning up the mess they\u2019ve made in the Murray-Darling Basin.\u201d\n\nMr Littleproud held meetings with crop producers in the northern Victorian city of Mildura on Tuesday and said the report was without foundation.\n\n\"The dams are part of efficiency programmes,\" he said.\n\n\"The water saved by those efficiency programmes is now held by the Commonwealth as water for the benefit of the environment.\n\n\"These programmes are audited by the Commonwealth. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority checks annually whether water take limits are met annually and the reality is farmers are not taking more than they are entitled to.\"\n\nMr Littleproud said 95 per cent of recipients from the on-farm irrigation efficiency program received less than $1 million in total value.\n\n\"The department depends on independent technical advise on how much water is saved,\" he said.", "description": "Water Resources Minister David Littleproud says a new report on privately-owned dams winning taxpayer funding is without foundation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4057%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_603%2C$y_130/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/712abb14a5a86d5689a62b6a9bbe1c40c2e6bca6", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
