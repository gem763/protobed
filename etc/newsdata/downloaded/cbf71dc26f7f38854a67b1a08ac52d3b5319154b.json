An American engineer known only as Doctora (Julianne Nicholson), whom they keep prisoner in ruins located on a remote, cloud-enshrouded mountain. And a milk cow they\u2019ve received on loan from a local supporter of their rebel cause.\n\nThese are the unique ingredients of Monos, a hallucinatory and harrowing journey into a heart of darkness that stands as one of the year\u2019s finest films.\n\nShot in Colombia but taking place in an unidentified region and during a mysterious conflict, Monos (in theaters Sept. 13) is a direct descendant of Apocalypse Now and Lord of the Flies, although to reduce it to merely a hybrid of those classics is to downplay its own distinctively trippy power. Directed by Alejandro Landes (who co-wrote the script with Alexis Dos Santos), it tells the story of Monos, a band of young male and female fighters that operates under the auspices of a larger Organization whose emissary, the Messenger (Wilson Salazar), is a little person with bulging muscles and a similarly formidable attitude. The Messenger\u2019s arrival at Monos\u2019 hillside outpost results in immediate physical training for the squad, which involves running in place with a fierce intensity that Landes captures in intense close-ups of his protagonists, as well as the delivery of the aforementioned cow, which the Messenger names Shakira and proclaims must be returned to its rightful owner, in due time, unharmed.\n\nThe leader of Monos is Wolf (Julian Giraldo), who gets permission from the Messenger to be with Lady (Karen Quintero)\u2014thus compelling his mates Bigfoot (Hannah Montana\u2019s Mois\u00e9s Arias), Smurf (Deiby Rueda), Boom Boom (Esneider Castro), Dog (Paul Cubides), Swede (Laura Castrill\u00f3n) and Rambo (Sofia Buenaventura) to chop down one of the region\u2019s innumerable trees in order to make them a \u201cwedding\u201d bed.\u201d Such toil is emblematic of this milieu, where physicality is everything. Downtime is spent wrestling and whooping it up, and birthdays are celebrated with belt lashings for each year. Primal aggression reigns supreme, and that goes for the women as well, who routinely situate themselves right in the mix of these aggro melees.\n\nMonos forces Doctora to make videos in which she reads from daily newspapers (thus proving the date of the recordings), but otherwise, she\u2019s kept locked away in a dingy room where, in one of many stunning snapshots of a mind fraying at the seams, she dances wildly, her head hung low, her arm propped against the wall, and her body writhing to a club beat only she can hear. Everyone in Monos exists in something like a fugue state, and that becomes literal when Bigfoot, Boom Boom and Swede find mushrooms sprouting in one of Shakira\u2019s dung piles, and decide to take a munch. Landes visualizes their ensuring trip with up-close-and-personal shots of water dripping off branches, and coitus performed in shimmering water, with down becoming up and vice versa.\n\nThe more Monos proceeds, the more it takes on the quality of a disturbing drug reverie. Landes routinely cuts to the oceans of white, billowing clouds that threaten to drown these characters\u2019 makeshift home (in one shot, they basically swallow the mountain peak whole). The fog of war is a gorgeous, all-consuming monster, and it soon leads these child soldiers astray, via an accidental calamity that begets an even more unexpected, and destabilizing, loss of life (and problematic lie). When combat arrives, via bursts of fiery nighttime explosions and gunfire, the group\u2014now led by Bigfoot\u2014heads into the jungle with Doctora in tow.\n\nFrom cool, misty, heavenly landscapes to lush, verdant terrestrial wilderness, that relocation certainly provides a change of scenery. It does not, however, improve almost anyone\u2019s fortunes, as Monos\u2019 main characters continue to devolve further into primeval beasts. Domination, survival and escape are the pressing concerns of all involved, and their escalating urgency is echoed by Mica Levi\u2019s nerve-grinding score, which segues from heartening flutes to cascading drums and intensifying electronic noises. It\u2019s the sound of the world\u2014and one\u2019s sanity\u2014rupturing, and its disquieting loveliness is matched by cinematographer Jasper Wolf\u2019s panoramas of the story\u2019s dueling settings and the young silhouetted figures that populate it.\n\n\u201c \u2018Monos\u2019 is a fable about sex, control, fear and alienation; an allegory about the hopeless self-destruction of war; and a mythic vision of youth gone wild. \u201d\n\nMonos is a fable about sex, control, fear and alienation; an allegory about the hopeless self-destruction of war; and a mythic vision of youth gone wild. From its characters\u2019 names\u2014comprised of animal species, pop-culture icons, and bland descriptors\u2014to its anonymous time period and geographic area, the film wades in the abstract while simultaneously providing clear, incisive portraits of its main characters: Bigfoot the wannabe-big shot; Boom Boom the loyal follower; Lady the sweet but conniving hierarchy-climber; and Rambo the sensitive skeptic. Even then, though, fuzziness remains an omnipresent facet of the proceedings, epitomized by the androgyny of Rambo, who\u2019s played by a girl (i.e. the stellar Buenaventura) and yet is frequently referred to as \u201chim\u201d\u2014and who partakes in an early three-way make-out with Wolf and Lady, further blurring any clearly demarcated gender/relationship lines.\n\nUnlike Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Vietnam epic, Monos isn\u2019t structured as a quest so much as a tumble into ever-rockier terrain. After cutting through the jungle brush, Monos\u2019 members discover that there are only two paths left available to them: descent into greater chaos, or flight back to the \u201cnormalcy\u201d of civilization. The latter undoubtedly comes with ramifications of its own, but Landes isn\u2019t interested in real-world sociopolitical context. On the contrary, the option to abandon the revolutionary cause is born of instinct. His film is less about cerebral notions than about base reflexes and compulsions, including those of Doctora, who\u2019s embodied by Nicholson with competing measures of hopelessness and desperate resilience. Like everyone else, she\u2019s been broken down to her animalistic self\u2014a situation that would be pitiful if it didn\u2019t also afford her the strength to retain hope.\n\nHorrifying and lyrical, laconic and harried, Monos is a work of unforgettable sights and sounds: shadowy boys and girls encased in mud, chanting and dancing around a campfire; a Temple of Doom-ish confrontation on a rope bridge; an entrancing motorboat excursion down a tranquil river; a decapitated pig\u2019s head placed before a tied-up prisoner; a plunge into roaring rapids, where millions of tiny bubbles struggle to ascend to the surface. It\u2019s an aesthetic marvel that you don\u2019t just admire\u2014you feel, in all its sticky, muddy, hazy brilliance.", "description": "Filmmaker Alejandro Landes\u2019 Colombian child soldier drama is stunning and devastating in equal measure.", "authors": ["Nick Schager"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_810,w_1440,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568346598/unnamed_7_lyr7fn", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
