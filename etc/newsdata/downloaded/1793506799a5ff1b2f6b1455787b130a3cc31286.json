Polling places near Tree of Life synagogue, where a gunman killed 11 Jews on October 27 in the worst anti-Semitic attack in US history, distributed the now familiar \"Stronger Than Hate\" stickers featuring a modified version of the Steelers logo, according to Jeanne Clark, chair of the Shadyside Democratic Committee, who said she came up with the idea. \"Obviously we've been having a tough time here in Pittsburgh,\" Clark told CNN Tuesday evening. Her answer: Voting stickers honoring the massacre victims. \" When horrible, horrible things happen, taking an action can make you feel better ... It's a wonderful way to help deal with all of our grief.\" Voters got the stickers at polling sites in and near the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the center of Jewish life in Pittsburgh. The logo has made its way around the internet since the tragedy, and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto made it his Twitter profile picture. Wochit-All\n\nSunday\u2019s public memorial in Pittsburgh on the one-year anniversary of a massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue will serve as more than a commemoration of the 11 lives taken in that heinous attack.\n\nIt\u2019s also a reminder that threats against the Jewish community are ever present, and if anything, they have grown.\n\nExactly six months after the mass murder in Pittsburgh, a gunman killed one person and injured three others \u2013 including a rabbi \u2013 at the Chabad of Poway synagogue outside San Diego.\n\nHere\u2019s where things stand a year after the Tree of Life tragedy earned the unwelcome distinction as the deadliest anti-Semitic attack ever on U.S. soil:\n\nWhat happened to the suspect?\n\nAccused gunman Robert Bowers was initially indicted on 44 counts of killing 11 people and injuring seven in the assault, which left three police officers wounded. Bowers was later hit with another 19 criminal counts that included federal hate crime charges.\n\nThe former Pennsylvania truck driver, now 47, is locked up at the Butler County Prison north of Pittsburgh, awaiting trial.\n\nA memorial outside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Oct. 29, 2018.

He had also displayed anti-Semitic tendencies online.\n\nCapital punishment has not been applied at the federal level since 2003, but Attorney General William Barr announced its reinstatement in July, and the Department of Justice said on Aug. 26 that it would pursue the death penalty for Bowers.\n\nBowers\u2019 defense team, composed of San Diego lawyer Judy Clarke and two public defenders, has said it would prefer to avoid a trial. Bowers offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life in prison, but prosecutors rejected that Oct. 15.\n\nWhen will he be tried?\n\nThe case has bogged down in legal maneuvers between the defense and federal prosecutors, who argue they\u2019re being stifled in their attempts to set a trial date, preferably for no later than September 2020.\n\nProsecutors have asked the judge to intervene and enter a scheduling order. In court papers, the defense called a September 2020 trial date \u201cunrealistic.\u2019\u2019\n\nHave anti-Semitic attacks increased?\n\nA report released a week ago by the Anti-Defamation League said in its headline, \u201cAmerican Jews face significant threats.\u2019\u2019\n\nPeople look at art that is displayed on a fence surrounding the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.

Puskar/AP)\n\nAccording to the organization, which fights anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, white supremacists represent the biggest danger in the U.S. At least 12 of them have been arrested and accused of having a role in plots, attacks or threats against the Jewish community over the last year. In that span, white supremacists targeted Jewish institutions at least 50 times, the ADL said.\n\nThe group\u2019s tally of anti-Semitic incidents in the U.S. since 2009 shows a major spike in 2017 \u2013 from 1,267 to 1,986, with a substantial increase in physical assaults \u2013 before a small reduction to 1,879 incidents in 2018.\n\nA total of 780 incidents were reported in the first six months of this year, only five fewer than over the same period in 2018.\n\nWhat events are planned for Sunday?\n\nThere are several, highlighted by the public commemoration ceremony at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall & Museum in Pittsburgh, where a vigil was held the day after the attack last year.\n\nThe Tree of Life building remains closed, and its fate is uncertain.\n\n\u201cWe will reopen,\u2019\u2019 said Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life congregation. \u201cWe must reopen, because if we don\u2019t, then evil wins, and we\u2019re not letting it win on my watch.\u2019\u2019\n\nJewish leaders have chosen the theme of \u201cRemember. Repair. Together.\u2019\u2019 for Sunday\u2019s activities, which will also include community service projects and study sessions of the Torah, the book of Jewish scriptures.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/27/tree-life-year-after-pittsburgh-attack-u-s-jews-threatened/2451390001/", "description": "A year after the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Jewish communities in the U.S. are still under threat.
