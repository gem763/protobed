Mommy, even if you do go to work, you won\u2019t make much money ... when I grow up I definitely won\u2019t let mommy go to work anymore.\u201d\n\nThe song, previously sung by Yan and his daughter on state broadcaster CCTV, went viral on Chinese social media earlier this month when its lyrics were posted online where they came under fire. Online users questioned the misogyny behind the lyrics, as well as why CCTV allowed the performance.\n\n'I love tech boys': Chinese job ads mirror sexist attitudes to women, study finds Read more\n\n\u201cHe looks like he lacked love from his own mother \u2013 maybe she abandoned him a long time ago, before his malicious hatred of women became evident in his lyrics,\u201d one user wrote. Another said, directing a comment at the child singing the song: \u201cAre you dumb? Your father doesn\u2019t earn as much as your mother does.\u201d \u201cDisgusting,\u201d others wrote.\n\n\u201cIn my home, my mother worked two jobs. She went to work and when she came home, she took care of the household duties too. It\u2019s only now that I realise that she was a real feminist,\u201d one user wrote.\n\nIn defence of the criticism, Yan said that he had written the song as a joke when his daughter was two years\u2019 old and would cry every time her mother left for work. But he did not back away from his point about his wife\u2019s lower salary.\n\n\u201cIn fact, my wife has to work every day, very hard, but the salary is not much. I wanted to express this point. I did not mean to hurt ... female compatriots. I am a very respectful of women and I also deeply understand how great great a mother\u2019s love is\u201d, he posted on Weibo.\n\nUsers who found the artist\u2019s back catalogue found other questionable songs, including, \u201cI have a good wife,\u201d in which he sings: \u201cMy wife, you listen to what I say. I will love you forever.\u201d In another song, a duet about getting married, he sings: \u201cYour future is my business now\u201d to which the woman responds: \u201cI will follow you wherever you go.\u201d\n\nAnother song is titled: \u201cthe woman who brings luck to her husband,\u201d referencing the traditional term, wangfu, used to depict female subordination.", "description": "Lyrics by little-known musician and comedian Yan Lifei go viral for all the wrong reasons", "authors": ["Lily Kuo"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d3e935a2c66a9f07b8adada51bea61bdd01016/76_0_1517_910/master/1517.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae467903c244104b5db1a7ec7281711", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
