The seas warm more slowly than the air but trap the heat longer with bigger side effects \u2014 and the report links these waters with Earth\u2019s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, because their futures are interconnected.\n\nFor the first time, the international team of scientists behind the report are projecting that some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change.\n\nBut many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report said.\n\nRead: Metals billionaire Andrew Forrest is making a $300 million bet on the next big commodity \u2014 plastic\n\nThe IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly four inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nThe new report projects that, under a business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between two feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters) with a most likely amount of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really from the highest mountains to the oceans, the systems are directly linked to each other,\u201d said Regine Hock, an author on this report and a professor of geophysics at the University of Alaska. \u201cIt is very important to recognize that you cannot just go and consider one system or one in isolation, but it\u2019s all these changes happening consistently and coherently around the world and they\u2019re linked together.\u201d\n\nRead: Banks worth $47 trillion adopt UN-backed climate pact \u2014 but only 3 of the top 10\n\nRead: Sixty-six UN participants pledge ambitious climate goals, as 30 vow to be carbon neutral by midcentury\n\nFood security, for one, can be greatly impacted by changing oceans.\n\n\u201cThis IPCC report is significant because it shows clearly that we cannot afford to leave oceans \u2014 and in particular, fisheries \u2014 out of the climate change discussion. Inevitable climate change impacts on the ocean mean inevitable impacts on the integrity of ocean ecosystems and the global nutrition, food security and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people around the world,\u201d said Doug Rader, chief oceans scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nRead: \u2018Investing in a simple index fund is immoral\u2019 \u2014 why climate-change investing has been more talk than action\n\nHere are some of the key takeaways:\n\n\u2013Oceans have gotten warmer, more acidic, and are losing oxygen, resulting in a cascade of negative effects that wreak havoc on marine ecosystems, threaten the collapse of the world\u2019s fisheries, and turbocharge deadly hurricanes and tropical storms.\n\n\u2013Polar ice sheet loss has increased dramatically, overtaking thermal expansion and glacial melt as the predominant cause of sea level rise since the IPCC last made an assessment in 2013. Sea level rise is now accelerating and the IPCC is now forecasting higher sea levels under the high-emissions pathway. Even under a low-emissions scenario, most of the East and West Coasts of the U.S. will experience a hundred-year flood every year unless major investments are made to adapt to these coming extreme events. Globally, this investment would run up to hundreds of billions of dollars per year.\n\n\u2013The world has reached or is nearing critical tipping points. Polar ice sheets may now be unstable, and as a result long-term melting may now be irreversible. Meanwhile, methane and carbon released as permafrost thaws will further contribute to warming, pushing toward a tipping point that, if passed, could trap the planet in a vicious feedback loop that could unleash accelerating warming.\n\n\u2013Water scarcity and wildfires will become worse as glaciers melt and snowpack declines. Already, communities that rely on glacial melt and snow runoff for agriculture and drinking water are left high and dry, while wildfires have grown increasingly common in the Arctic and high mountains as permafrost and snowpack melt.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The world\u2019s oceans are getting warmer and rising faster than thought \u2014 melting even more ice and snow \u2014 while also losing oxygen and becoming increasingly...", "authors": ["Rachel Koning Beals", "News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS040_glacie_ZG_20190925110038.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
