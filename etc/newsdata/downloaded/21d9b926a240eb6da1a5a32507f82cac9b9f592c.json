More than 230,000 people died in 13 countries.\n\nHere on Thailand\u2019s southern coast, where the beaches and the sea are packed with tourists and fishermen this time of year, more than 5,000 people died.\n\nThese days, countries in the region are preparing to mark the 10th anniversary of the disaster.\n\nMonuments are being refurbished and cemeteries have been cleaned up. Some new signs are seen besides faded ones warning of a tsunami hazard zone.\n\nSoon, the eyes and cameras of the world will be turned towards the beautiful beaches of Phuket and Khao Lak once again.\n\nReporters have started looking for survivors to recount their stories. We will listen to politicians make speeches and we'll photograph various ceremonies.\n\nBut we will also venture off the main road, away from clean beaches, to see how people from communities that are not in the centre of attention are doing.\n\nHow is Manee, a migrant from Myanmar and her unemployed fisherman husband who lost their three children on that day in 2004 managing to cope? Have their wounds healed?\n\nWhat happened to the more than 400 unclaimed bodies still buried in a mass grave, across the road from an abandoned former identification centre that closed its doors years ago?\n\nWill those who died be identified and reunited with their families for a proper funeral, or will they remain unclaimed forever?\n\nIn my mind, major anniversaries such as this are always a good opportunity to check on visible and less visible scars and to see what can be done to prevent such devastating numbers if a similar disaster hits again, here or elsewhere.", "description": "December 26 marks the 10th anniversary of the Indian Ocean Tsunami, the deadliest on record, which smashed into 13 Asian and African countries, swallowing up homes and changing the coastline forever.", "authors": ["Damir Sagolj"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ-1WmbxG9Rz3WlciY13sbzRrsqd86y-VrHf3lztKJi3sqEjgBUEA8NHA2kwr7XJvuC3EM9HRfcveCLsDMKaHZx22KdN0ufErI7blD0DStgCb"}
