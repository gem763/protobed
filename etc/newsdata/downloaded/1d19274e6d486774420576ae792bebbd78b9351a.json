The game also was a rematch of the Copa Am\u00e9rica final, won 3-1 by Brazil on July 7.\n\nNeymar came on in the 63rd minute along with Liverpool\u2019s Fabinho, and Real Madrid\u2019s Vinicius joined them in the 74th minute. The stars made a late push, but couldn\u2019t level the match in front of a lively crowd of 32,287 at the venerable Coliseum in Los Angeles.\n\nNeymar scored a goal and assisted on another during Brazil\u2019s 2-2 draw with Colombia in Miami last Friday, but he was on coach Tite\u2019s bench to start in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was unable to score his 62nd international goal, which will match Ronaldo\u2019s career total for the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nNeymar\u2019s tumultuous summer ended with the superstar still at Paris St. Germain despite extensive negotiations to return to Barcelona. Although PSG took disciplinary action against him for missing training in July, he is expected to return after the international break.\n\nBoth teams had chances to score in the opening half, but couldn\u2019t convert. Brazil also had a scary moment when Casemiro jumped above David Neres for a header, and the teammates came down holding their heads from the collision. Casemiro returned with a bandage on his head.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Luis Abram scored his first international goal on a header in the 85th minute, and Peru ended Brazil's 17-game unbeaten streak since last year's World Cup with a 1-0 victory Tuesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/brazil_peru_soccer_51699_c0-93-3771-2291_s1770x1032.jpg?d9e0ca013d32dca7e1552c5bdb660f8eb0805f24", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
