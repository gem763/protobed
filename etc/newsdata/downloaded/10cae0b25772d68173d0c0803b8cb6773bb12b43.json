Rivalries aren\u2019t just matters of personal animus, though they\u2019re often that. They carry the weight of governing, the risk of clashes left unresolved that implicate the fate of human lives, populations, and even nations. This is especially true for black Americans. One way of looking at our history in the U.S. is as a slow and fitful accumulation of rights. These rights are often conditional and contingent, but access to a broader range of housing, education, social, and employment opportunities is hard to dispute, as is the muting of many forms of violence that defined enslavement and Jim Crow. The compression of these advances into a few decades\u2019 time has meant tumultuous changes for those who\u2019ve survived them, including the black organizers and leaders who helped usher them in. But it has also vivified the costs of regression for them, knowing firsthand how bad things can get. So it was with Elijah Cummings, the Baltimore-area U.S. representative who died on Thursday at age 68, just as the first term of the most openly racist presidential administration in recent memory was coming to a close.\n\nCummings\u2019s foil was Donald Trump, the Republican commander-in-chief whom he\u2019d been tasked with investigating as chair of the House Oversight Committee. Back when he was running, Trump anchored his campaign, fueled by the slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d to a tacit glorification of an era before black people had anything resembling equal rights, and white dominance went largely unchecked. He has since comported himself like a return to such a time was his goal. Regular features of his presidency have included efforts to erode the political power of nonwhite people and the wanton use of pejoratives to describe them, casting Muslims as terrorists, Latinos as criminals, black people as \u201cshithole\u201d-dwellers, and his nonwhite political opponents as conditionally American. Cummings was a direct target of these attacks. In July, Trump lambasted him for criticizing conditions in the administration\u2019s migrant detention camps, claiming instead that \u201c[Cummings\u2019] Baltimore district is FAR WORSE,\u201d \u201ca disgusting rat and rodent infested mess\u201d where \u201cno human being would want to live,\u201d and which federal funds are being stolen from. (Trump provided no evidence for the latter claim.)\n\nCummings weathered the insults and continued his work, which recently became central to a broader House impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s conduct. But he did not live to see its outcome. Rather he died, having witnessed immense progress in his own life, amid a concerted effort to erode it, with no idea whether the man who most embodies that effort will be defeated. Much is made in America of upholding the ideals advanced by the best who came before us \u2014 whether it\u2019s the so-called Founding Fathers or those who sought to ensure that their proclamations about liberty and justice were more than hollow platitudes. But one of racism\u2019s most venomous features is that it doesn\u2019t require smart, competent, or even very committed people to easily undermine their work, or to let black people who survived the Jim Crow era to die, without peace, during a resurgence of its supremacist attitudes.\n\nHistory owes us nothing, suffering doesn\u2019t automatically make us virtuous, and evidence that the moral arc of the universe bends toward justice is dubious at best. But it\u2019s hard to argue that Americans who claim fealty to a set of common principles rooted in freedom owe nothing to the black people who forced their country to reckon with its own violent hypocrisy during the mid-20th century, and those who survived that reckoning. We owe them peace. And Cummings was one of them. Growing up in Baltimore, one of six children born to South Carolina sharecroppers, his childhood was marked by indelible experiences with racism and its fallout, including being stopped by police while out past curfew following the riots of 1968, when he was still a teenager. Every day after work at a chemical plant, his father would come home and sit in the car for an hour, parked outside the family home. Cummings eventually asked him why. \u201cHe told me that he was often treated badly at work, dealing with discrimination, and he didn\u2019t want to bring those things, any bitterness, into our home,\u201d the late congressman told Baltimore magazine.\n\nAt age 11, Cummings became involved with efforts to integrate a local swimming pool, which were met with the staunch and sometimes brutal resistance of his white neighbors. According to the Washington Post, mobs numbering upward of 1,000 angry white locals protested, brandishing signs that read \u201cKeep our pools germ free\u201d and \u201cWhite people have rights too\u201d while throwing rocks and bottles at black would-be swimmers. \u201c[These] were adults,\u201d Cummings remembered. They \u201ccalled us every name you can imagine, everything but a child of God.\u201d Cummings was struck in the head by one of their projectiles. \u201cThe injured child, who received a face cut during a brief scuffle at the Riverside Park pool, was driven from the scene in a police cruiser,\u201d the Associated Press reported at the time. Cummings bore a scar above his eyebrow from the incident for the rest of his life. But the more important element that lingered was his encounter with a fellow dissident, a renowned NAACP lawyer named Juanita Jackson Mitchell. \u201cI declared in that moment that I was going to become a lawyer,\u201d Cummings said. And he did, practicing law for years before deciding to run for office.\n\nWhen Cummings eulogized the slain Baltimorean Freddie Gray in 2015, a police killing that sparked the second citywide riot in his lifetime, he talked about the messages that modern-day Americans are sending through their behavior to the inhabitants of tomorrow. \u201cI\u2019ve often said that our children are the living messages we send to the future we will never see,\u201d the congressman said, \u201cbut now, our children are sending us to a future they will never see. There is something wrong with that picture.\u201d Gray was 25 when he died, the victim of an ongoing refusal to ensure the safety of America\u2019s most vulnerable as a principle. The election of Trump is another. His political movement is predicated on the denial of grace and safe haven to those he deems unworthy. Cummings\u2019s generation of black people is among the last to have witnessed the horrors of Jim Crow, who saw it fall and its topplers go from reviled troublemakers to national heroes. He died knowing that many of the advances achieved during his youth are still under assault. That the peace which accompanies leaving his country in responsible hands, guarded by leaders invested in preserving those advances, evaded him as he succumbed to illness is a profound betrayal of all he\u2019s done to make us better.", "description": "Elijah Cummings\u2019 death during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency highlights how allowing current circumstances betrayed what he fought for.
