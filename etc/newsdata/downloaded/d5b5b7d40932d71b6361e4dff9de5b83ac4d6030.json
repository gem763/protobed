Crosthwaite said in a statement.\n\nThis comes after Juul stopped actively supporting San Francisco\u2019s Proposition C, ceased its advertising campaigns in the U.S and stopped lobbying the FDA on its draft flavor guidance.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean Juul is giving up on selling these flavors in the future. The company said it will continue to try to develop scientific evidence to support the use of those flavored products, as well as develop stricter measures to combat underage usage. Meanwhile, Juul is still selling all of its flavors outside of the U.S.\n\nEarlier this week, a parent who lost her child filed a wrongful lawsuit against Juul. That suit is just one of several lawsuits Juul faces.", "description": "Juul has stopped selling a number of its flavored nicotine products \u2014 mango, creme, fruit and cucumber \u2014 in the U.S., pending a review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
