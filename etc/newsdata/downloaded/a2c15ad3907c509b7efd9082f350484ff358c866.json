It\u2019s kind of surreal to me. I\u2019m just living in the moment and it\u2019s going to be a big night for both myself and Lauzon. This is a legit dream \u2013 it\u2019s pretty outrageous.\u201d\n\nCosta is hyped ahead of the biggest night of his MMA career, but while he admits the special nature of the event, he also said he\u2019s aware of his need to keep a lid on his emotions in order to deliver the performance and the result he wants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m literally the middle of a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t any other way to look at it. I\u2019ve trained so hard to get to this point right here, and this week is the most crucial to make sure you don\u2019t get bombarded with those emotions, you know? Let those emotions come after the fight, where everything settles down and you\u2019re like, \u2018Holy (expletive). I just fought at the Garden.\u2019 But now is not the time to let it happen. The time right now is to focus on (Friday), and Boston and I are going to fight. And then afterwards, things can set in and go, \u2018Holy (expletive). I just fought in the Garden, and on the same night as Lauzon. This is pretty outrageous.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe matchup itself offers Costa an unusual dynamic. The pair were originally set to train together, and Salmon (6-2 MMA, 0-1 UFC) offered Costa the chance to stay at his house and train with him. But that all changed when Costa got the call offering Salmon as an opponent. \u201cThe Zohan\u201d recalled the conversation with a smile.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to train with him, and I gave him a call and I said, \u2018I have good news and bad news,'\u201d Costa said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What\u2019s the good news?\u2019 I was like, \u2018We\u2019re probably going to be fighting on the same night again.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Really?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s go and win $50,000. Let\u2019s get this bonus. Let\u2019s put on a show for everyone, and we\u2019ll take full advantage of this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe fight was signed, with the two fighters agreeing to lay it all on the line to deliver a spectacular matchup in their bantamweight preliminary card clash. Costa admitted he has a lot of time for Salmon, but also said he had no qualms about stepping into the cage and throwing down with someone he considers a friend.\n\n\u201cFor $50,000 extra? Absolutely not,\u201d Costa said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go out there and we\u2019re going to put on a show. You won\u2019t get me to say a single negative thing about Boston. He\u2019s an awesome dude, period. No question about it \u2013 his skills are great. I\u2019m excited to share the cage with someone with as much talent as him. I think his style and my style go very well together and it can be nothing short of fireworks. We\u2019re both going to go out there and we\u2019re just going to bang. There\u2019s literally nothing else to it.\u201d\n\nSuch is the level of respect Costa has for his opposite number, he said he would love nothing more than for the pair of them to be celebrating matching bonus checks at the end of the night after securing \u201cFight of the Night\u201d honors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get \u2018Fight of the Night,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t be selfish because he\u2019s a friend of mine. Had I disliked Boston, I\u2019d be like: \u2018(Expletive) that. I want \u201cPerformance of the Night.\u201d\u2018 But I like Boston, so let\u2019s share this.\n\n\u201cI want a banger of a fight that people go, \u2018Holy (expletive). The fans won that fight.\u2019 I just want a good show where people know who I am, who he is, and I want to set the path moving forward that, when it\u2019s time to fight, these two guys are going to fight.\u201d\n\nAnd while the respect between the pair is clear, Massachusetts native Costa knows that he\u2019s taking on a man who shares a name with the city in which they\u2019re competing. He admits there could be some split loyalties in the stands when the pair meet on Friday night, but said he wants the fans to know exactly who the local fighter is, and to throw their vocal support behind him on fight night.\n\n\u201cObviously, his name is Boston and he has a lot of ties with Boston,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m from here, so fans better not be cheering for him, they\u2019d better be cheering for me.\u201d", "description": "Local bantamweight Randy Costa is determined to deliver a \"Fight of the Night\" performance against Boston Salmon at UFC on ESPN 6 in Boston.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Dan Tom", "Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "John Morgan", "The Blue Corner", "Abbey Subhan", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/randy-costa-ufc-boston-video.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
