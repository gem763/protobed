They don\u2019t explain why they signed off on inaccurately edited version or why they didn\u2019t say anything all day yesterday. https://t.co/2jqtDE4dOM \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nIn response to a question about any other women coming forward, the authors excitedly tell Max Stier story, never mentioning that they never spoke to the woman or that she denied it through several friends. Difficult to blame this on editing. \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) September 17, 2019\n\nInvestigative journalist and Townhall columnist Phelim McAleer also pointed out that they continued with the lie in their NPR interview.", "description": ".09/17/2019 9:09:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/260/85ce7777-a904-4a4c-a04e-5644d212f1d0.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
