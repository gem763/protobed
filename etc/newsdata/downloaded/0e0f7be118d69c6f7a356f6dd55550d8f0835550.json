Fitch Affirms ANZ's Mortgage Covered Bonds at 'AAA'/Stable\n\n(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Sydney-September 09: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited's (ANZ, AA-/Negative/F1+) AUD14.4 billion of outstanding mortgage covered bonds at 'AAA'. The Outlook is Stable.This follows a periodic review of the covered bond programme. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ----senior secured, Mortgage Covered Bonds, Mortgage Covered Bonds; Long Term Rating; Affirmed; AAA; RO:Sta KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAA' rating of the mortgage covered bonds is based on ANZ's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'AA-', on the various uplifts above the IDR granted to the programme and the overcollateralisation (OC) protection provided through the programme's asset percentage (AP).The covered bonds are rated three notches above the bank's IDR. This is out of a maximum achievable uplift of four notches, consisting of an IDR uplift of zero notches, a payment continuity uplift (PCU) of three notches and a recovery uplift of one notch. Fitch's analysis relies on the programme's committed AP of 90.5% used in the Asset Coverage Test.The Stable Outlook reflects a one-notch buffer against an IDR downgrade.UpliftsThe IDR uplift remains unchanged at zero notches. There is no specific advanced resolution regime in Australia, but the regulator has the ability to resolve a bank under its regulatory powers pursuant to the Banking Act. Even so, covered bonds are not exempt explicitly from bail-in should a bank be resolved, which may result in the direct enforcement of recourse against the cover pool for the payment of the outstanding covered bonds. Therefore, ANZ's Long-Term IDR remains the floor for its covered bond rating.The PCU remains unchanged at three notches. The PCU assessment is driven by the outstanding hard-bullet bonds (10.9%) despite the larger proportion of soft-bullet bonds that benefit from a 12-month extension period. These hard-bullet bonds have limited cure periods of up to six months under the 12-month pre-maturity test, which remains relevant to the assessment of liquidity. It also reflects the three-month interest protection in a reserve that will be funded upon the loss of ANZ's Short-Term IDR of 'F1+'.The recovery uplift on the rating is capped at one notch, as the programme is exposed to foreign-exchange risk from recoveries given default of the covered bonds. This is because the cover assets are denominated in Australian dollars, while about 95.1% of the covered bonds outstanding are denominated in other currencies. Swaps are in place on the liabilities, but we expect those swaps to terminate in a recovery scenario.'AAA' Breakeven APFitch's revised 'AAA' breakeven AP of 91.5% corresponds to 9.3% 'AAA' breakeven OC, which allows the covered bonds to attain a 'AA+' rating on a probability of default (PD) basis and one-notch recovery uplift to 'AAA'. The ALM loss of 5.5% remains the largest component of the breakeven OC for the rating and reflects the modelled asset and liability mismatches, inclusive of the effect of the pro rata sales clause documented in the programme. The ALM loss has decreased from 6.3% at previous analysis, due to the reduced servicing fees and pro rata sales requirement modelled. The stressed weighted-average (WA) residual life of the cover assets calculated by Fitch is at 7.9 years (down from 8.0 years), including prepayments, and that of the liabilities is at 3.7 years (down from 4.1 years). The credit loss component is unchanged at 3.5% and reflects the credit quality of the underlying cover pool. Cover Pool Summary The cover pool consisted of 70,947 loans secured by first-ranking mortgages of Australian residential properties at end-July 2019, with a total outstanding balance of AUD20.0 billion. The WA seasoning for the cover pool was 45.5 months. The WA loan/value ratio for the cover pool was 63.3% and the Fitch-calculated consolidated WA indexed loan/value ratio was 62.5%. Investment loans comprised 26.2% of the pool, while interest-only loans formed 14.0%. The cover pool is geographically diversified across Australia, with the largest concentrations in New South Wales (33.6%) and Victoria (29.6%). Fitch calculated that, in a 'AAA' scenario, there would be a cumulative weighted-average foreclosure frequency (WAFF) of 8.8% (previously 9.2%) and a weighted-average recovery rate (WARR) of 54.5% (previously 56.6%) for the cover pool. The higher WAFF figure is driven by ANZ's improved cover pool credit quality, while the lower WARR figure is driven by a lower WA residential property price index that Fitch used in its modelling, reflecting softening property prices. RATING SENSITIVITIES ANZ's 'AAA' covered bonds' rating would be vulnerable to a downgrade if the bank's IDR was downgraded by two or more notches to 'A' or below; or if the relied upon AP provided less protection than Fitch's 'AAA' 91.5% breakeven AP. If the AP in the programme rises to the maximum 95% contractual AP stipulated in the programme documents, the rating on the covered bonds would fall to 'AA', one notch above the IDR.Fitch's 'AAA' breakeven AP for the covered bond rating will be affected, among other factors, by the profile of the cover assets relative to the outstanding covered bonds, which can change over time, even in the absence of new issuance. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the 'AAA' breakeven AP, which maintains the covered bond rating, will remain stable over time. SOURCES OF INFORMATION The source of information used to assess these ratings was ANZ. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used in the analysis of the rated bonds is public. PUBLIC RATINGS WITH CREDIT LINKAGE TO OTHER RATINGS The covered bond ratings are driven by the credit risk of the issuing financial institution, as measured by its Long-Term IDR.", "description": "Fitch Affirms ANZ's Mortgage Covered Bonds at 'AAA'/Stable", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1F0SS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
