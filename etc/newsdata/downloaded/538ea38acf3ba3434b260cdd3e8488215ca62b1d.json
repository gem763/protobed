But it\u2019s still a lot cheaper to get the drug from illegal dealers.\n\nA gram of cannabis purchased from government-sanctioned sellers cost $10.23 in the third quarter, down 3.9 per cent from the prior three-month period, according to Statistics Canada. At the same time, the price for a gram of pot bought in the illicit market fell 5.9 per cent to $5.59.\n\nThe country\u2019s statistics office has been publishing data on prices since before Canada legalized recreational marijuana in October 2018. It uses a crowd-sourcing application to gather information on consumer behavior and web scraping to collect prices from illegal online retailers. The latest reading was the first that showed a quarterly decrease in the cost of legal pot.\n\nSince legalization, illegal prices have fallen 12% and legal prices have gained 4.9%, even with the third quarter\u2019s decline. The price gap has allowed the black market to retain a robust share of Canada\u2019s cannabis market, with 42% of cannabis consumers saying they purchased at least some of their pot from illegal sources in the second quarter.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Gram of cannabis on legal market costs almost twice as much", "authors": ["Kristine Owram", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/pot-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
