Both sides are seeking to reach an agreement before an EU summit next week.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly,\u201d Varadkar told Irish broadcaster RTE late Tuesday after a 40-minute phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\n\u201cEssentially what the United Kingdom has done is repudiate the deal that we negotiated in good faith with Prime Minister (Theresa) May\u2019s government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table and are saying, \u2018That\u2019s a concession\u2019. And, of course, it isn\u2019t really.\u201d\n\nThe comments contradicted Johnson\u2019s office, which said Tuesday that EU intransigence had led to a breakdown in negotiations.\n\nThe U.K. said, however, that it still hopes to strike a deal. Johnson and Varadkar are expected to meet in person later this week.\n\nJohnson says Britain will leave without a negotiated settlement if a deal can\u2019t be reached by the Brexit deadline of Oct. 31. The Times of London reported Wednesday that five Cabinet ministers are threatening to resign if the Conservative government adopts a no-deal Brexit as its central policy.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Irish prime minister\u2019s last name is Varadkar, not Varadkhar.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said that big gaps remain between Britain and the European Union as they try to secure a Brexit deal by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/09/878211_sweden-ireland-brexit-13776-irish-prime-minister-leo-varadkar-grimaces-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
