A crowdfunding campaign for the lens is launching on Kickstarter today. It sells for $199, with plans to ship in November. Moment says it\u2019ll sell the lens at retail for $300.\n\nMoment made its name selling lenses that clip on to the back of a phone, offering different fields of view and more options for photographers. As interest in traditional Instagram posts has waned, Moment co-founder Marc Barros says the company has found room for growth by appealing to vloggers and filmmakers. Drones, he says, were the other key tool filmmakers have started relying on.\n\n\u201cThey all had a phone, a big camera, and a drone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just looked at what people were using,\u201d he says. \u201cThey all had a phone, a big camera, and a drone.\u201d Moment\u2019s team says they were able to fly the Mavic 2 Pro in heavy winds with the new lens attached, and it didn\u2019t affect the drone\u2019s performance.\n\nIn addition to the new lens, Moment is selling clip-on ND and CPL filters for both its own lens and the drones\u2019 built-in lens. It\u2019s also made a new iPhone case that\u2019s slim enough that the phone can slip inside the drone\u2019s controller without it being removed. The filters will sell for $99 on Kickstarter ($120 at retail), and the case will go for $25 ($30 at retail). Because the Mavic 2 Pro and Mavic 2 Zoom have different cameras, separate lenses and filters will be sold for each model.\n\nMoment launched its first anamorphic lens last year. At $150, it\u2019s Moment\u2019s most expensive lens, but it\u2019s also one of the cheapest ways to start shooting anamorphic, a format that usually requires pricey lenses for high-end cameras. Barros says Moment expected it to be a niche product, but it\u2019s become the company\u2019s \u201cnumber one selling lens,\u201d with around 50,000 units produced so far.\n\nCreating a lens for a drone comes with some added complications. DJI\u2019s drones use a gimbal to stabilize the camera and record smooth footage, and clipping a heavy lens on the front would disrupt its ability to properly balance. To fix that, Moment has reduced the weight of its existing anamorphic lens by changing the housing from metal to plastic. (The glass remains the same.) A clip that secures the lens on the camera also includes a weight in back to properly counterbalance the added heft. Moment\u2019s existing anamorphic lens was already among the lightest in its lineup, which means it could be harder for the company to adapt other lenses, like its telephoto, for use on drones, too.\n\nBecause the lens is being added on top of an existing lens, it comes with some drawbacks. You\u2019ll have to reattach it every time you start up the drone. It also doesn\u2019t work as well at all focal lengths. Since the drone camera is already pretty wide, the effect is limited unless you punch in.\n\nThen there\u2019s the problem with shooting anamorphic: anamorphic lenses squeeze footage to fit more on the sensor, and that footage then needs to be de-squeezed in order to properly view it. That means panorama photos won\u2019t turn out properly. It also means that, when monitoring your footage, it\u2019s going to look a little strange. Moment says it\u2019s talking to DJI about potentially adding the ability to automatically de-squeeze footage inside the drone\u2019s controller app, but that\u2019s not a sure thing at this point.\n\nStill, in a world where drone footage is increasingly common and all looks about the same, Moment thinks its anamorphic offering will win over a lot of filmmakers who are looking to stand out. It also appears that Moment will be one of the only companies \u2014 if not the only company \u2014 to offer clip-on lenses for DJI drones.\n\nBarros says the development of the lens is mostly done and that Moment now needs to figure out how many units to actually make. \u201cThis is the least risky of all the Kickstarters we\u2019ve done,\u201d he says.", "description": "Moment is expanding its line of add-on camera lenses beyond smartphones for the first time with a Kickstarter to launch an anamorphic lens for DJI drones.
