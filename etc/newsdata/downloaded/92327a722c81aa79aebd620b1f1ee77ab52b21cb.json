News of the subpoenas was first reported Monday by The New York Times.\n\nDanny Frost, a spokesman for Vance has declined to confirm the existence of a grand jury probe or comment about it. Frost said the district attorney\u2019s office has \u201creceived the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and will respond as appropriate in court,\u201d adding that prosecutors will not make any additional comments on the case as it makes its way through court.\n\nThe person familiar told the Beast that the legal precedent is high for obtaining a subpoena as part of a grand jury proceeding and the bar is similarly high to get a judge to throw it out.\n\nThe lawsuit is the strongest sign yet that the president\u2019s legal team is extending the hardline tactics they\u2019ve used on congressional Democrats to prosecutors.\n\nTrump has vowed to fight \u201call the subpoenas\u201d from Congress, including a subpoena from the Ways and Means Committee for access to Trump\u2019s tax returns, which that panel is uniquely situated to obtain. The courts are currently weighing whether trump can block that subpoena\u2014which centers on Congress\u2019 possession of a legitimate legislative purpose for the information\u2014and it may go to the Supreme Court. Courts are also considering a subpoena from the House Oversight Committee for financial records of Trump\u2019s businesses, which a judge recently expedited.\n\nThe president\u2019s team may stymie Democrats, but the application of that strategy to block prosecutors\u2014who have far more tools and leverage at their disposal than lawmakers do\u2014will be severely tested.\n\nManhattan prosecutors are seeking Trump\u2019s personal tax documents and those of the Trump Organization from accounting firm Mazars USA, including federal and state returns dating back to 2011.\n\nThe subpoena was issued after prosecutors opened a grand jury investigation into the role Trump and the company played in the hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Trump, the person said. Trump has denied the affair.\n\nMichael Cohen, the president\u2019s former personal attorney, made the $130,000 payment to Daniels, and was subsequently reimbursed by the president and the Trump Organization.", "description": "In a statement, the president\u2019s lawyer Jay Sekulow said the lawsuit was filed \u201cin order to address the significant constitutional issues at stake in this case.\u201d", "authors": ["Pervaiz Shallwani", "Sam Brodey", "Senior Editor", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2379,w_4230,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568907845/RTX70PRY_hkgdek", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
