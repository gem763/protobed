The woman immediately reported what had happened to Greater Manchester Police.\n\nShe suffered bruising and cuts to her neck.\n\nThe woman, who bravely faced her attacker in court to read out a statement, was also able to pick him out during a video identification procedure.\n\nBanciu's DNA was recovered on swabs taken from the woman's neck after he gave her what was described in court as a 'love bite'.\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nBanciu, who had only arrived in the UK from his native Romania a few weeks before the attack, was jailed for six years and four months by Recorder Michael Hayton QC after he pleaded guilty to rape.\n\nHe was arrested at Liverpool Airport, where he was due to board a flight to London.\n\nProsecutors believe he was planning on then travelling back to Romania.\n\nWhen interviewed by police, Banciu told officers that he regularly begs on the street, and that he sees sex workers two or three times a week.\n\nHe said he didn't know the victim and wasn't aware of committing an offence, but apologised.\n\nThe victim, who was in court for the sentencing, read out a statement from the witness box.\n\nShe said: \"After this happened, it changed me as a person.\n\n\"I am not the same. I don't feel the same inside.\n\n\"It has had a terrible effect on my relationship with my boyfriend.\n\n\"I am having trouble sleeping at night. I wake up thinking about what happened.\n\n\"It's still very raw. I will never understand why he didn't let me walk off. I will never understand why he had to be so violent to me that night.\n\n\"I wish he had left me to walk off as I wanted to.\"\n\n(Image: MEN Media)\n\nAhmed Nadim, defending, said that Banciu was experiencing a 'heightened emotional state'.\n\nThe defendant sobbed during the hearing.\n\nMr Nadim said Banciu came to the UK about five or six weeks before the incident to 'improve his life' and to help his young family in Romania.\n\nHe said that Banciu worked and was also begging on the streets 'in order to supplement his income'.\n\nSentencing, Recorder Hayton QC told Banciu: \"You used violence and sexual violence against a woman who you spoke to in the street.\n\n\"You came to an agreement about paying for sexual services.\n\n\"When a dispute arose as to how much you were going to pay, you carried on your intention to have sex with her, and you punched, kicked and bit her during that violent sexual assault.\n\n\"She not only had the courage to go to the authorities and complain about what you did, but also the courage to come to court to face you and read out her victim personal statement.\"\n\nBanciu was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life.", "description": "Zoro Banciu, 33, kicked the woman in the crotch before raping her after offering her a \u00a35 note on a street in Manchester", "authors": ["Andrew Bardsley", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Men Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743820.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Zoro-BanciuJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
