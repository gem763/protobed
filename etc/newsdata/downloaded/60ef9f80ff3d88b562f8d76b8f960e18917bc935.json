Alternatively you can bookmark this page and return on matchday to follow all the action with our dedicated live blog.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nJonny Sexton is expected to return at fly half after a knock kept him out against Japan but Joe Schmidt is likely to ring the changes elsewhere. Garry Ringrose, Rob Kearney, Keith Earls and Peter O\u2019Mahony are the only players likely to retain their placed while Jordi Murphy will replace Jack Conan?\n\nWhat are the results so far?\n\nIreland:\n\nIreland 27 Scotland 3, Yokohama\n\nJapan 19 Ireland 12, Shizuoka\n\nRussia:\n\nJapan 30 Russia 10, Tokyo\n\nRussia 9 Samoa 34, Kumagaya\n\nWhat are the remaining fixtures?\n\nIreland v Samoa, Fukuoka, Saturday October 12\n\nScotland v Russia, Shizuoka, Wednesday October 9\n\nWhat are the permutations?\n\nTwo bonus points win will assure Ireland of a place in the quarter-finals despite their debacle against Japan. If teams finish level on points then head-to-head decided qualification, good news for Ireland if the finish level with Scotland but less so if they finish level with Japan.\n\nWhat are the odds?\n\nIreland 1/500\n\nRussia 50/1\n\nDraw 100/1\n\nWhat is our prediction?\n\nWe think a refreshed Ireland team will have far too much for Russia who will almost certainly finish rock bottom of Pool A.
