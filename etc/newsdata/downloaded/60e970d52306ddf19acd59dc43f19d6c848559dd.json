Poirier (25-6 MMA, 17-5 UFC) would love to do it again, and he believes he\u2019s a perfect opponent for McGregor (21-4 MMA, 9-2 UFC) to face after more than a year away from MMA.\n\n\u201cI think it could happen; I don\u2019t know how likely it is,\u201d Poirier told MMA Junkie. \u201cI\u2019m still at the top of the division. He\u2019s ranked under me. If he wants to get back to the title, there\u2019s only one way to do that is to fight. I\u2019m the next guy in line, so I think it makes a lot of sense. My star has never been brighter, and people want to see Conor back, and I think it would be a huge fight, and it would be a huge pay-per-view. I just want a fight that\u2019s going to make me excited. I\u2019ve been doing this a long time and not that I\u2019m not motivated, I just want to be excited about it.\u201d\n\nPoirier was knocked out by McGregor in the first round when they fought at UFC 178. The fight took place in the featherweight division, but both have since moved up to 155 pounds. Poirier said he\u2019s a far more mature fighter compared to then, and while he\u2019s suffered more defeats along the way, the loss to Nurmagomedov in particular has helped him grow.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons since then,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot better. It\u2019ll be six years or so since we fought. I\u2019ve tightened up a lot of things, got a lot smoother, I\u2019m more defensively responsible now. After the Michael Johnson loss, I went back and really started to work on my defense, my range, my timing, and my understanding of distance. I think that really shows in the fights I\u2019ve had since then. It\u2019s the same thing with this Khabib fight. I wasn\u2019t defensively responsible on the ground.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent thousands of hours on the ground and had people try to choke my neck, and in the fight with Khabib I was more worried about trying to wear this guy down than I was about the danger of the potential of the chokes and the submissions. The alarm wasn\u2019t going off like, \u2018Emergency!\u2019 I wasn\u2019t defensively responsible. Not that I didn\u2019t think I could get submitted, but I don\u2019t get submitted very often honestly, and I think I can make these guys work and get up. But he\u2019s a different animal, and I need to tighten up. Lesson learned.\u201d\n\nAlthough Poirier would take the McGregor rematch instantly if the UFC called with an offer, he\u2019s not getting his hopes up for the immediate future. That works well, actually, because Poirier has some health issues to get in order. Poirier said he\u2019s been dealing with a nagging hip for several years, and he plans to have it examined while he awaits his next fight.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t offered me anything yet, but I would fight again this year if it makes sense,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cBut if not, maybe the first quarter of next year. I\u2019m going up to Colorado in a week to get my hips checked out by a hip specialist and just to get a second opinion. My hip has been bothering me the last couple years. If I can do a scope or something like that, it\u2019s going to take me out for six weeks, and it makes me feel amazing in my next camp, I\u2019m going to take that and do that. But we\u2019ll see.\u201d", "description": "Running it back with Conor McGregor would be the significant opportunity Dustin Poirier is hoping for.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Simon Head", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "John Morgan", "Christian Stein"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dustin-poirier-ufc-242-workouts-6.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
