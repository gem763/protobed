The company called it one DJI\u2019s largest partnerships with a fire-fighting agency in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to be strengthening our partnership with the LAFD, one of the nation\u2019s preeminent public safety agencies, to help them take advantage of DJI\u2019s drone technology that has been purpose-built for the public safety sector,\u201d said Bill Chen, Enterprise Partnerships Manager at DJI, in a statement at the time. \u201cThrough our two-way collaboration, DJI will receive valuable insight into the complexities of deploying drones for emergency situations in one of the most complex urban environments in the nation.\u201d\n\nNow, roughly five months later, the program seems to have been successful enough that Battalion Chief Fields is looking to double the fleet.\n\n\u201cOur next iteration is to start using our drones to assist our specialized resources,\u201d said Fields. Those are firefighters and support crews that deal with hazardous materials, urban search and rescue, marine environments and swift water rescues, Fields said.\n\nThe technology demands of the fire department extend beyond the drone itself, Fields said. \u201cThere are a lot of technologies that allows us to make the drone more versatile\u2026 the most valuable tool isn\u2019t the drone; it\u2019s the sensor.\u201d\n\nSo far, the most useful application has been using infrared technologies to balance what\u2019s visible and combine it with the heat signatures the sensors pick up.\n\nTraining to become a drone pilot for the LAFD is particularly intense, Fields says. The typical pilot will get up to eighty hours of training. \u201cOur training is nation-leading. There\u2019s nothing out there in the commercial market that beats it,\u201d according to Fields.\n\nFor now, the entire LAFD fleet is composed of DJI drones, something which has given military and civilian officials pause in the past few years.\n\nConcerns have been growing over the reliance on Chinese technology in core American infrastructure extending from networking technology companies like Huawei, to drone technology developers like DJI.\n\nBack in 2018 the Department of Defense issued a ban on the acquisition and use of commercial drones, citing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The ban came a year after officials from the Department of Homeland Security and members of Congress called out DJI specifically for its potential to be used by the Chinese government to spy on the United States.\n\nHowever, the rule isn\u2019t set in stone and many branches of the military continue to use DJI drones, according to a September Voice of America News report.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Fields says he takes those concerns seriously. The department has worked closely with regulators and advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union to craft a strict policy around what gets done with the data that the LAFD collects.\n\n\u201cThe way that we establish our program is that the drone provides us with our real-time situational awareness,\u201d said Fields. \u201cThat helps the incident commander get a visual perspective of the problem and he can make better decisions.\u201d\n\nThe only data that is recorded and kept, says Fields, is data collected around brush fires so that the LAFD can do a damage assessment, which can later be turned into map layers to keep records of hotspots.\n\nAs for data that could be sent back to China, Fields says that any mapping of critical infrastructure is done without connecting to the internet. \u201cIt\u2019s being collected on the drone and 90% of that information is how the drone is operating. There is some information of where the . drone is and how it is and the [latitude] and [longitude] of the drone itself\u2026 That\u2019s the data that\u2019s being collected,\u201d Fields says.\n\nFrom Fields\u2019 perspective, if the government is so concerned about the use of drones made by a foreign manufacturer, there\u2019s an easy solution. Just regulate it.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s come up with a standard. If you use them in a federal airspace these are the check marks that you have to pass,\u201d he says. \u201cSaying that DJI drones are bad because they come from China [and] let\u2019s throw them all out\u2026 that\u2019s not an answer either.\u201d", "description": "As it looks to modernize its operations, the Los Angeles Fire Department is turning to a number of new technologies including expanding its fleet of drones for a slew of new deployments.
