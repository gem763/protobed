On Saturday night, as three of the victorious Democrats were honored at an annual political dinner, a new battle was on everyone\u2019s minds: How to protect those gains in 2020 by selling voters on the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the dinner, Rep. Harley Rouda warned Democrats not to \u201csit on our laurels.\u201d Rep. Mike Levin solemnly said \u201cthe times have found us.\u201d And Rep. Gil Cisneros, who came out for the inquiry only last week, plugged his campaign website twice to ask for donations and noted, \u201cThe Republicans are coming after me now.\u201d\n\nA tricky balancing act is now underway for House Democrats as they return to their districts for a two-week recess that will double as a crucial time to frame a coast-to-coast debate over impeachment and the nation\u2019s priorities.\n\nEven as surveys showed more Americans embracing an impeachment investigation, voters talked mostly about issues like health care and the economy over the weekend at town hall meetings and party gatherings with House Democrats. Those members, especially in battleground districts, responded by highlighting their policy accomplishments and goals \u2014 while at the same time attempting to shape public opinion on impeachment and prepare voters for coming GOP attacks.\n\nThat Democratic messaging challenge came into sharp relief during interviews with voters like Donna Artukovic, a retired teacher who was volunteering at the Orange County dinner. Artukovic expressed nervousness about what an impeachment battle could mean for Democratic candidates.\n\nRep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.) speaks to guests at the Harry S. Truman awards dinner hosted by the Democratic Party of Orange County in Anaheim, Calif., Sept. 28, 2019.(Allison Zaucha/The New York Times) More\n\n\u201cI am afraid it\u2019s going to hurt them,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people \u2014 even who don\u2019t like Trump \u2014 don\u2019t like impeachment.\u201d\n\nRep. Andy Kim of New Jersey, a Democrat who ousted a Republican incumbent in 2018 by focusing on issues like health insurance coverage for preexisting conditions, held a town hall-style meeting in his district Saturday where only one voter asked about impeachment (and even then, it was part of a multipronged question). In an interview afterward, Kim noted the paucity of questions on a topic that has engulfed Washington.\n\nReferring to his constituents, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to stop working on lower prescription drug costs and health care costs; they want us to move forward on infrastructure and jobs.\u201d\n\nAs committed as he is on those goals, Kim said, he will also seek to draw on his experience as a former National Security Council member \u2014 which included sitting in on President Barack Obama\u2019s calls to world leaders \u2014 to explain his views to voters on a matter like Trump\u2019s phone conversation this summer with the president of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s hopefully what they\u2019ll judge me on,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether or not I was able to do this with a level of professionalism that\u2019s distant from the partisanship they so badly despise.\u201d\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 decision to undertake an impeachment investigation has already upended the presidential campaign, presenting both risks and opportunities to Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, whose son\u2019s work for a Ukrainian gas company prompted Trump\u2019s extraordinary intervention. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s change of heart on considering impeachment, following months of reluctance to pursue an inquiry in the face of polls showing public resistance, has injected just as much uncertainty into the Democrats\u2019 effort to retain the House.", "description": "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Orange County was the epicenter of the 2018 House Democratic takeover, where Republicans lost four seats in what was once the heart of Ronald Reagan conservatism in California.
