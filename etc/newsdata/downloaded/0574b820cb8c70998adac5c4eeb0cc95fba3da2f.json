With hundreds of stakeholders eagerly awaiting big growth and a global audience of press, buyers, influencers and stylists ready for scrutiny, the Italian designer is still firmly in the spotlight as one of fashion month\u2019s biggest tickets.\n\nLast season, a mash-up of street style and sophistication set out a vision for what the creative director called \u201ca country of contrasts\u201d and harked back to an era of Cool Britannia. This season \u2013 spring / summer 2020 \u2013 Tisci offered a much more global perspective.\n\nGone were the punk and hip-hop references and in came a dominance of Italian glamour. The abundance of Nova Check and garish branding of the autumn/ winter 2019 collection was replaced with hues of silvery grey, light camel and monochrome motifs.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSet in the Troubadour theatre in White City (which had \u2018Burberry\u2019 pasted across it for the occasion), the space saw a central mirrored box rise up when the show began, to reveal a raised runway antiqued rust flooring. Models circled a construction of a vast Victorian-inspired sound system, walking to electronic music.\n\nThe no-celebrity policy adopted at the last few seasons appeared to have been abandoned, with a step-and-repeat Burberry board at the entrance of the show offering paparazzi a chance to capture big-name guests. Nevertheless, the runway remained the focus, as models including Kendall Jenner (with freshly dyed blonde hair), Gigi and Bella Hadid, Irina Shayk and even Agyness Deyn \u2013 who had given up modelling \u2013 walked the show.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

everyone from the traditionalists to the fashion avant-garde and the glamorous red-carpet star. Much of it harked back to Tisci\u2019s work for Givenchy, which made him a favourite among the Kardashian clan; feathered dresses, slinky silver gowns and tasselling suggested he is angling to bring this lucrative following with him to Burberry.\n\nWomenswear was refined: Hermes-style scarves printed with tiger heads draped and tied around bodies, elegant trousers and shirting offered impeccable high-powered workwear and suiting played a big role. Eveningwear saw the return of last season\u2019s corseting, as well as sheer fabrics, netting and ruffles.\n\nThe menswear included traditional suiting but was largely still dedicated to targeting the street style market (one often imprudently overlooked by most ready-to-wear designers), with hoodies, oversized shirts, trainers and more conspicuous branding featuring heavily.\n\nA dab hand at haute couture, Tisci was once again keen to utilise his construction skills, playing with traditional hemlines through elongated backs of T-shirts (so long they flapped between models\u2019 legs as they tried to navigate the runway) frills, ribboning, split trouser legs, cut outs and deconstructed suiting.\n\nAccessories have always been the most accessible way in to a luxury brand like Burberry, and Tisci continued to offer his Thomas Burberry monogram branded handbags, alongside new 1960s-style glasses and a recurrent piece: the fisherman\u2019s hat.\n\nOf course, the Burberry trench wasn\u2019t forgotten (although it didn\u2019t play a central role as it used to in Bailey\u2019s era), with a few appearing sparingly throughout the collection. With no discerning theme, each trench was a standout piece on its own: one had wings and a Pepto-Bismol pink back, another was infused with activewear coding and monochrome stripes; one \u2013 modelled by Deyn \u2013 was covered in crystal embellishment and another, skimmed the floor like a train.\n\nCrystals, which were used relatively sparingly last season, now reigned supreme \u2013 clothes were practically bathed in them, from trench coats to T-shirts and dresses. Some garments were cloaked in crystal chain mail, and the fisherman\u2019s hat that was repeated throughout the collection, even came in a version with a crystal veil.\n\nIt was a collection that \u2013 for the most part \u2013 stood apart from last season\u2019s heavily streetwear-inspired offering \u2013 perhaps in response to shareholder pressures. Settling into his role at the helm of Britain\u2019s biggest heritage brand, Tisci revealed his ability to create a collection that will no doubt have widespread international appeal. Does it feel like the Burberry we all know and love? Not quite yet \u2013 but it\u2019s still early days. The collection title, \u201cEvoltuion\u201d suggests this is only the beginning.", "description": "One year after taking the reins at Burberry following the departure of Christopher Bailey as creative director, Riccardo Tisci expanded on his nascent vision for the heritage British brand\u00a0at London Fashion Week.
