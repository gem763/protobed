Biden is demanding that major television networks stop booking Trump defender Rudolph W. Giuliani, saying the former New York mayor is spreading false information about Biden connections to Ukraine and China.\n\nThe campaign said it is \u201cno longer enough\u201d that reporters fact check Mr. Giuliani\u2019s statements in real time.\n\n\u201cWe write to demand that in service to the facts, you no longer book Rudy Giuliani, a surrogate for Donald Trump who has demonstrated that he will knowingly and willingly lie in order to advance his own narrative,\u201d the campaign wrote in a letter to news executives and journalists at outlets such as CNN, Fox News, and NBC News, dated Sept. 29 and obtained by Politico.\n\nMr. Giuliani has emerged as a leading critic of Mr. Biden and has raised questions about the business connections his son, Hunter Biden, has had in Ukraine and China.\n\nA whistleblower complaint that helped spark House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push said Mr. Giuliani is a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in Mr. Trump\u2019s alleged pressuring of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Giuliani said the letter is proof that the Bidens are \u201crattled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of the Biden arrogance and entitlement to protection,\u201d Mr. Giuliani said on Twitter late Sunday. \u201cThey believe they own the media, and they are demanding that they silence me. They know I have incriminating facts, not hearsay, because they know what they did in selling Joe\u2019s office to a Ukrainian crook.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
