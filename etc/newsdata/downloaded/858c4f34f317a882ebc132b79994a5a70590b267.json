OK, fine, but you have to move along,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cI tried to talk to him twice, alone, but he just wants no part of that. If he\u2019s not going to do that I have to do my job as best as I can.\u201d\n\nGrossi said he\u2019s uncomfortable becoming a part of the story but stands by the way he conducted himself when questioning Mayfield.", "description": "The reporter who felt the wrath of Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield today after asking what Mayfield called the \"dumbest question you could ask\" says that it wasn't the first time he and Mayfield haven't seen eye to eye.
