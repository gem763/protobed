The stock rebounded slightly after Apple\u2019s statement, down 1.7% to $219.38 per share as of 3 p.m. ET.\n\nIn a research note, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said he expected Apple to account for the one-year free trial of Apple TV Plus as a discount of about $60 (which would be the retail cost of Apple TV Plus for one year) in the hardware segment.\n\n\u201cEffectively, Apple\u2019s method of accounting moves revenue from hardware to services even though customers do not perceive themselves to be paying for [Apple] TV+,\u201d Hall wrote. The analyst cited Apple\u2019s previous accounting methods for services like Apple Maps and the Siri voice assistant, which are included with its hardware products.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple announced that Apple TV Plus will launch Nov. 1 in over 100 countries and regions, priced at $4.99 per month (with a seven-day free trial) for existing customers and free for 12 months with the purchase of any iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod touch or Mac.\n\nApple is premiering nine original shows on Apple TV Plus when the service launches, including \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d a drama starring and executive produced by Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, and starring Steve Carell; \u201cSee,\u201d a drama starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard, set 600 years in the future after a virus has decimated humanity; and \u201cFor All Mankind,\u201d an alternate-history series from Ronald D. Moore about the space race.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
