The fell 1.1% over the last five trading days as the benchmark pared its third quarter gains to about half a percent.\n\nStocks were also pressured by the start of the U.S. House of Representative's newly opened impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, a political development that will add a new layer of uncertainty to trading conditions.\n\nBeyond these macroeconomic events, we're watching three largecap stocks which could see some action this week, the result of company-specific developments in the days ahead:\n\n1. PepsiCo\n\nSnack and beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) will third quarter earnings on Thursday, Oct. 3 before the market opens. Analysts expect EPS of $1.5 a share on revenue of $16.93 billion.\n\nPEP Weekly TTM\n\nThe upcoming quarterly report could provide additional evidence that Pepsi\u2019s earnings momentum is backed by a strong demand revival and the success of the company\u2019s product mix which includes such popular brands as Frito-Lay, Tostitos and Ruffles brand chips and Mountain Dew's energy fuel carbonated beverage line, a favorite among gamers. In the previous quarter, the demand for the soft dring giant\u2019s caffeine-boosted drink, aimed at video-gamers, was so strong that the company couldn\u2019t keep its re-sealable cap in stock.\n\nA positive earnings surprise would help Pepsi shares outperform rivals as the stock continues its strong upward move, which began during the past year. Shares closed on Friday at $135.60, having gained more than 20% this year so far.\n\n2. Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: )\n\nThe retail sector will come under scrutiny once again when Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ) reports its fiscal 2019 fourth quarter results on Thursday, Oct. 3, after the close. Analysts are expecting $2.54 a share in profit on sales of $47.48 billion.\n\nCOST Weekly TTM\n\nUnlike the weak showing by some top retailers during their recently concluded quarters, chances are that Costco (NASDAQ: ) will provide a . The company said last month that its August same-store sales were strong, exceeding analyst estimates.\n\nThe company\u2019s future guidance will be more important for investors, at a time when cost pressures are rising because of the U.S.-China tariff hikes that have started to pinch retailers who import products from China.\n\nAs well, there is growing evidence from recent economic reports that the U.S. economy is . If that slowdown persists, it could hurt consumer sentiment as the year progresses.\n\nSo far, however, shares of Costco (NASDAQ: ) have remained an investor favorite. The stock closed at $285.95 on Friday, up around 40% thus far this year.\n\n3. Alibaba (NYSE: )\n\nIt looks as though the U.S.-China trade spat will continue to weigh on Chinese tech stocks listed on the , in the wake of reports that the White House is considering ways to limit U.S. investments in China.\n\nAccording to a CNBC report, the White House could include a block on all U.S. financial investments in China with the goal to protect American investors. No decisions have been made at this time, however, and it\u2019s nowhere near complete, sources told the network.\n\nBABA Weekly TTM\n\nBut the report was enough to trigger a sell-off in Chinese stocks led by Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: ) which dropped more than 5% on Friday. That weakness, in our view, could extend in the coming weeks unless we there's a positive outcome to trade negotiations.\n\nThe report appears to be a pressure tactic by U.S. officials before October's crucial trade talks with China. The resulting equity weakness could offer a buying opportunity in some of our favorite stocks, including Alibaba (NYSE: ). After closing at $165.98 on Friday, shares are up 19% for the year.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Haris Anwar/Investing.com covering: S&P 500, Costco Wholesale Corp, PepsiCo Inc, NASDAQ Composite.
