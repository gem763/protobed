The settlement was offered by LG after it lost legal cases between 2011 and 2013 accusing SK of violating the same patent, SK says. This agreement was to last 10 years, but \u201cLG broke its promise.\u201dSK\u2019s Tuesday suit seeks damages of 1 billion won ($853,000) - 500 million won for violations in the domestic market and 500 million for the U.S. market - and urges LG to voluntarily withdraw the patent infringement accusation on three U.S. patents. These three are equivalents to patent KR 775,310 and two derivative patents of technologies based on the KR 775,310 registered in Korea.\u201cLG Chem is excessively filing law suits to obstruct a stable business - now, it\u2019s gone as far as to bring up an issue in which we agreed not to engage in additional suits,\u201d SK said in a statement.On the same day, LG Chem fired back with a statement arguing that the agreement in question only regards Korean patents and not corresponding foreign patents. It is still in full compliance with the written contract of 2014, LG said.\u201cBased on the principle of patent independence, patents in different countries are obtained and maintained independently from one another, and the scope of patent protection rights can differ accordingly,\u201d the statement said.LG also explained that the 2014 settlement said there would be no dispute \u201coverseas\u201d exclusively regarding KR 775,310.\u201cIn licenses or agreements, the representative way to decide on the scope is using patent numbers or specifying technology or products. The settlement in question used numbers, so for patents with a different registration numbers, the contract has no effect,\u201d LG said.It also challenged SK\u2019s claim it had lost lawsuits in 2011. It said it did lose once, and appealed, but dropped the case before a ruling. It added that SK had also lost and that the two companies signed the contract as a result of the suits.BY SONG KYOUNG-SON [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
