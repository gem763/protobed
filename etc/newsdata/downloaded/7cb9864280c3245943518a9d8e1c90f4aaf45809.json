Bills in Congress have proposed setting $700 million to $1 billion aside for telecom companies to replace their networks.\n\nThe U.S. government says Huawei, the world\u2019s biggest supplier of telecom gear and No. 2 smartphone manufacturer, poses an espionage threat. It has presented no evidence of its equipment being used for spying by the Chinese government and both Huawei and ZTE have denied their equipment is used for such purposes.\n\nThe U.S. government also has been pressuring allies to ban Huawei from their networks and has restricted exports of U.S. technology to Huawei.", "description": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China on Tuesday accused the U.S. of \"economic bullying behavior\" after U.S. regulators cited security threats in proposing to cut off", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/29/4ddf0b_restricting-chinese-telecom-42512-in-30-2019-file-photo-woman-walks-by-huawei-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
