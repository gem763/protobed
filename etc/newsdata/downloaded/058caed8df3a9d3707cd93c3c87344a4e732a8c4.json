The problem was we only scored one goal.\n\n\u201cWe knew we were going to fight for the win and we did. Without luck we cannot win the amount of games we have won but over the 90 minutes, we deserved it.\u201d\n\nNow one away from equalling Manchester City\u2019s all-time record for consecutive top-flight league wins, Liverpool hold an eight-point lead at the top.\n\nThere is a long way to go in the season, but having shown resilience three times in a week to edge matches that could have gone either way, they have shown they possess the fighting spirit to secure their first top-flight title since 1990.", "description": "Liverpool have blown many teams away under Juergen Klopp's guidance, but for a third successive match they showed a different way to win in a 2-1 victory over Leicester City which maintained their perfect start to the Premier League season.", "authors": ["Peter Hall", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437454082&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940GK", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
