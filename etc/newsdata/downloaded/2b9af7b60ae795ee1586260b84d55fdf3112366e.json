We have removed the \u201cunder review\u201d designation, restoring the College Board\u2019s status as an active signatory.\n\nOur review was initiated after we were made aware of concerns regarding the information re-disclosure practices of a number of the College Board\u2019s partners. The College Board was responsive to the concerns FPF staff raised over the course of our review and has acted to resolve the issue. We have confirmed that the College Board has changed its policies to prohibit re-disclosures by colleges or other partners. The College Board has also taken steps to ensure its partners are adhering to the new policies. More broadly, the College Board has made renewed institutional commitments to safeguarding student data, including the appointment of a chief privacy officer.\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nJohn Verdi, Vice President of Policy, FPF, [email protected]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-05-17"}
