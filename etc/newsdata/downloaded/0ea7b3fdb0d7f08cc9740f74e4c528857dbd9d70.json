As convoys of Turkish Armed Forces vehicles rolled toward the border with Syria, Turkey launched airstrikes and artillery fire at Kurdish strongholds in the country.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one fighter from the Syrian Democratic Forces has been killed so far and six others have been wounded. An SDF spokesperson also said two civilians have been killed as a result of the \"Turkish bombardment\" of the village of Mashrafa and Kurdish forces are warning of a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d that could potentially unfold because of the Turkish military operation.\n\nTURKISH INCURSION INTO SYRIA WOULD FORCE KURDS TO FLEE, FREEING CAPTURED ISIS MEMBERS, GEN. KEANE SAYS\n\nThe news of the Turkish assault ratcheted up the criticism Trump has received from the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party, which has long defended the U.S. presence in the volatile region and, in response to the troop pullback, warned that Washington is abandoning its only true ally in Syria.\n\n\u201cNews from Syria is sickening,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the House\u2019s third-ranking Republican, tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cTurkish troops preparing to invade Syria from the north, Russian-backed forces from the south, ISIS fighters attacking Raqqa.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cImpossible to understand why [President Trump] is leaving America\u2019s allies to be slaughtered and enabling the return of ISIS.\u201d\n\nIn arguably the tensest situation the president has been in with his own party since assuming office -- amid an impeachment fight where most GOP lawmakers still support him -- Trump sought to clarify his stance Wednesday afternoon. In a written statement, he said he does not support Turkey\u2019s invasion of the region, but added that his goal since launching his presidential bid in 2015 was to stop \u201cthese endless, senseless wars\u2014especially those that don\u2019t benefit the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place\u2014and we will hold them to this commitment.\u201d\n\nSEN. MCSALLY SAYS US SHOULD STAND WITH KURDS\n\nThe president\u2019s statements followed a number of tweets Wednesday morning defending his push to stop \"endless wars.\"\n\n\"Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East,\" Trump tweeted. \"The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\"\n\nThe president added that he is \"slowly & carefully\" bringing home \"our great soldiers & military,\" in line with his campaign promise to do so.\n\nHe added: \"Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., one of Trump\u2019s closest allies and a leading voice in the Senate on foreign policy, stepped up his criticism of the president Wednesday, telling \"Fox & Friends\" that if Trump \"follows through with this, it would be the biggest mistake of his presidency.\"\n\nFRENCH OFFICIALS CRITICIZE US OVER ANNOUNCED MILITARY PULLBACK\n\nIn tweets, Graham also urged prayers for \"our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\" adding, \"This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\" He also said he would lead an effort in Congress to \"make Erdogan pay a heavy price.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s decision has largely been panned by congressional Republicans, the president has a very vocal ally on Capitol Hill: Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nTrump and Paul have clashed on various issues since both were vying for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, but the two share a common ideology when it comes to opposing American intervention in foreign countries.\n\n\u201cI know this [Trump] is the first President in my lifetime to understand what is our national interest and what is not,\u201d Paul tweeted. \u201cHe is stopping the endless wars and we will be stronger as a result. The Cheney/Graham Neocon War Caucus has cost us too much fighting endless wars.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nTrump\u2019s call for ending U.S. military involvement in the Middle East and bringing the troops home was a feature of his presidential campaign, but it flies in the face of many decades of bipartisan American policy, even as the Trump administration and its immediate predecessor have tried to give additional attention to what they see as long-term security threats elsewhere, including from China and Russia.\n\nThe U.S. has more than 10,000 troops based across the Middle East, including about 5,200 in Iraq, 1,000 in Syria and several thousand others at bases in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Also, the U.S. Navy's Mideast headquarters is at Bahrain in the Persian Gulf.\n\nJust a couple of months ago the Pentagon reestablished a troop presence in Saudi Arabia after a lengthy absence, and in May it added air and naval forces in the region in response to what it views as worrying threats from Iran.\n\nFox News\u2019 Greg Norman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria following President Trump\u2019s unexpected pullback of troops from the border region has reignited a fight within the Republican Party over America's role in the Middle East\u00a0-- and seen the president face withering criticism from some of his otherwise staunchest allies in Congress.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/08/694940094001_6093148884001_6093150160001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
