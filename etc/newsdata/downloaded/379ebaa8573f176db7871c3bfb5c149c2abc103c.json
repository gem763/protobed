Her margin of victory over China\u2019s silver medallist Tang Xijing was 2.1 marks, the biggest she has recorded in any of her record-breaking five all-around world titles.\n\nBiles\u2019s own modest self-analysis might have been prompted by the 0.5 penalty marks she collected. When she performed her much talked-about \u201ctriple double\u201d on the floor, she landed with such force that she bounced a step backwards and out of bounds with both feet. That was 0.3 gone, and there were two other minor slips that cost her 0.1 each.\n\nBut the great thing about being Simone Biles is that she doesn\u2019t need to go clean. She is performing moves at a different level to all her competitors \u2013 and pulling them off with a lack of visible effort that reduces spectators to open-mouthed astonishment, or often stunned laughter.\n\nWhen you add up the difficulty scores for Biles\u2019s routines on the four pieces of apparatus, they come to exactly 25 marks. Xijing, who is highly ambitious by any other standard, comes in at 22.600. She would have needed Biles to fall off at least two pieces to have a chance. In fact, this did happen last year, but Biles still came in almost 1.700 marks ahead of the field to become the first four-time world all-around champion.", "description": "Simone Biles rated her own performance as a seven out of ten after crushing the rest of the all-around field at Stuttgart\u2019s World Championships.", "authors": ["Simon Briggs", "Marcus Armytage", "Sir Ian Mcgeechan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212633480-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
