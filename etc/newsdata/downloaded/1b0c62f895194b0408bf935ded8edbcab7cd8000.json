The original crafter who started the project was Rita Smith, who died in August at age 99, Downey said.\n\ninto the bedroom and found a box full of fabric. I opened it up and discovered it was a massive quilting project that was just begun. Every bit of the project mapped out and in this plastic tub. I sat on the floor and almost cried bc I knew I had to buy it and finish it but pic.twitter.com/yAGq3AVUMF \u2014 Shannon \u201cBadass Cross Stitch\u201d Downey (@ShannonDowney) October 23, 2019\n\nOnce Downey learned Smith\u2019s age, and saw how many other crafting projects she\u2019d completed \u2014 \u201cshe was a ferocious crafter,\u201d Downey said \u2014 she doubled down on completing the massive quilt. Downey is both an avid crafter and also is active in the crafting community.\n\nAD\n\nDowney took to Instagram, asking her fellow crafters for help embroidering the states.\n\n\u201cA short story and request for stitching help,\u201d she began in her post. \u201cYou know my love of estate sales and the fact that I cannot handle stumbling upon unfinished projects. I just know that the person who passed can\u2019t possibly rest easy with an unfinished project out there. I buy them and finish them as tribute.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe explained what she found at the estate sale in the Mount Prospect home of the late Rita Smith, who was \u201cclearly an astounding stitcher with a love for the U.S. and state flowers.\u201d\n\n\u201cRita had prepped, cut, all the squares and started transferring the designs onto the squares. She started stitching New Jersey. Obviously I bought the whole box. I cannot possibly stitch all this myself with all the rest of my stuff but I\u2019m wondering if we can crowd stitch/crowd finish this project for Rita?!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was a public call for people to volunteer to stitch a square. The plan would be that Downey would mail a square to a volunteer, who would then stitch that state and mail it back. Then once she gets them all back, she\u2019d host a quilting party to put them all together.\n\n\u201cAnyone interested in helping me help Rita rest in craft peace?!,\u201d she asked.\n\nAD\n\nThe response was overwhelming, she said, with more than 1,000 stitchers offering to help on Instagram.\n\nShe picked 100 people \u2014 50 for the states and 50 to each stitch a star \u2014 and then she made a spreadsheet to keep track of it all. She went to the post office and mailed out 100 envelopes, asking volunteers to send back the completed embroidery by Nov. 15.\n\nAD\n\nI made a massive spreadsheet and collected mailing addresses. I started preparing the squares to ship out to my new team. As I did, I discover Rita had stitched 2 of the states already! What a grand surprise. I\u2019m not saying I cried but I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t. pic.twitter.com/YfkzPZ25NO \u2014 Shannon \u201cBadass Cross Stitch\u201d Downey (@ShannonDowney) October 23, 2019\n\nShe mailed the envelopes to volunteers across the country. Michelle Anais Beaulieu-Morgan, 41, who works at Yale University, received an envelope at her Connecticut home after seeing Downey\u2019s post on Instagram and volunteering to be part of it.\n\n\u201cCrafting for me is part of my recovery story \u2014 I\u2019m about 4.5 years sober,\u201d Beaulieu-Morgan said in an email to The Washington Post. \u201cThe slow work of embroidering is really meditative. Also, I think historically embroidery has been under-theorized and certainly not appreciated nearly enough.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe is about halfway through embroidering her home state, Maine, and said she expects, in total, it to take her about 20 hours to finish.\n\nAD\n\nChez Knox Kirk, 42, who lives in Birmingham, Ala. and is embroidering Alabama, said she also volunteered through the Instagram post. She estimates it will take her between five and 10 hours to finish her state.\n\n\u201cI love anything that brings people together for a bigger cause,\u201d Kirk, a systems analyst, wrote in an email to The Post. \u201cWe are so much more than what divides us. This group is honoring Rita\u2019s life by finishing her project.\u201d\n\nDowney posted her story on Twitter on Wednesday, and it quickly went viral. She said she was really happy with all the support for Smith, whom she learned had a husband who died in 2009, and also a son who is still alive.\n\nAD\n\nThe packages are arriving to my stitchers and they are furiously stitching their hexies. We are using the completed map that I bought (that we can reasonably assume was made by Rita) to try to mirror her stitching techniques and style! pic.twitter.com/MH5Usb8IvA \u2014 Shannon \u201cBadass Cross Stitch\u201d Downey (@ShannonDowney) October 23, 2019\n\nOne unexpected upside of this experience has been support on social media from her fellow crafters who share her anxiety about failing to finish a project.\n\nAD\n\nShe said there are two kinds of crafters: people who love to start projects but don\u2019t finish them, and people who don\u2019t move on until they\u2019ve finished what they\u2019re working on.\n\n\u201cI am a crafter who finishes projects,\u201d Downey said. \u201cI live with this bizarre fear I\u2019ll leave behind a project and be in project purgatory forever.\u201d\n\nShe said it\u2019s because she puts so much of herself into each project, the idea of leaving it undone is \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\nNow, she said she\u2019s knows she\u2019s not alone in that idea.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI did not expect this response,\u201d she said. \u201cFolks are totally willing to throw down and finish things.\"\n\nDowney, the director of development at a nonprofit, said she hopes to have the quilt completed by December or January, and she\u2019d like to find a home in a quilt museum for it.\n\n\u201cI want it to be somewhere it will be appreciated and a testament to what Rita created,\u201d Downey said. \u201cAnd also what community can do. This is such a beautiful story of the power of social media for good.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Shannon Downey stumbled on an unfinished quilt project at an estate sale, and enlisted an army of stitchers to help her finish it.", "authors": ["Allison Klein", "Anchor Of The Inspired Life Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XOyuznq0nbP9R9Ru3HkBRrKBdsg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZDEEIPJ3CNF45KDO4MPC464WLY.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
