However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nBelieve me guys, you don't know what you're missing out on if you don't yet have a voice assistant in your life. For instance, with over 50,000 skills, Alexa can assist you in ways you didn't even know you needed, like helping you track your fitness goals, improve your sleeping habits, or even advance your child\u2019s learning. Whether you want her in the form of a handy Echo Dot, or paired with on-screen visuals like with the Echo Show 5, these smart devices can be an incredibly useful addition to your home, and right now, they're on sale.\n\nYou really can\u2019t go wrong with the Echo Dot or the Echo Show 5, no matter which you choose. The Echo Dot is our favorite affordable Echo speaker, while the Echo Show 5 is Amazon's latest gadget to be released in their smart home collection, and has been garnering positive reviews so far. Right now, the Show 5 is available for a mere $64.99, which is $25 off its usual price, while the Dot is on sale for $39.99, which is $10 off its normal price. While not the absolute lowest we've seen either device available for, these likely won't dip any lower until Black Friday, so now's a great time to get your hands on one before the holiday season.\n\nSmall but mighty with a 5.5-inch display, the Echo Show 5 is perfect to perch atop your kitchen counter for easy recipe-following, or on your night stand to check the news, traffic, and weather after you wake up. The Echo Dot, on the other hand, is a great tool to set reminders and alarms, add things to your shopping list, and grant you voice control over your compatible smart home devices.\n\nHands-free skills like these make the both Echos especially helpful for busy parents, working professionals, students, and just about anyone who is always running out the door. At these prices, you could even get one of each for different rooms in your home, so Alexa is always there when you need her.\n\nGet the Echo Show 5 on Amazon for $64.99 (Save $25)\n\nGet the Amazon Echo Dot (3rd gen.) on Amazon for $39.99 (Save $10)\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
