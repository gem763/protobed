In Manhattan, the share of apartments offering concessions dropped to 31.9% in August, compared to 34.7% for the same month in 2018.\n\n\n\nIt was the seventh decline in the last eight months, according to the report. The size of concessions also slipped to 1.2 months of free rent or equivalent, down from 1.3 months the previous year.\n\n\n\nIn Brooklyn, concessions were part of 38% of the deals in August, compared to 42% last year. But Mr. Gavzie cautioned that concessions could increase in mid-November and continue through the off-season.\n\n\n\nRental price growth in Manhattan was seen across all market segments and sizes of apartments. The median rental price for luxury apartments, defined by Elliman as the top 10% of leases, rose 3.9% year over year to $8,000 a month, compared to $7,700.\n\n\n\nMedian rent for luxury units in Brooklyn rose more than 13% to $6,523, compared to $5,770 in August 2018, according to the report.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Watchmaker Richard Mille Had a Big Weekend in the World of Sports\n\nReal estate brokerage Citi Habitats also found rents have risen in its Rental Market Analysis released Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt found the most expensive New York City neighborhood for renters last month was SoHo/Tribeca (by a large margin), which had a median rent of $7,480.
