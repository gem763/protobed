the latest batch of European qualifiers and international friendlies, this one is sure to be anything but boring.\n\nSome of the big footballing nations go head-to-head in tasty encounters, following hot on the heels of Germany's clash with Argentina on Wednesday.\n\nThe likes of Kylian Mbappe , Neymar, Sadio Mane and Gareth Bale are all set to be in action for their respective countries.\n\nAnd we've picked out four upcoming matches that you simply have to feast your eyes on this international break...\n\nFrance vs Turkey\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWorld cup winners France are determined to finish at the top of group H in the Euro qualifiers, and face two big clashes.\n\nThey travel to Reykjavik on Friday to face a tricky tie away at Iceland, but then follow that up with a huge clash as they play host to Turkey on Monday..\n\nFrance were left stunned in June when they were beaten 2-0 by Turkey, ending their unbeaten run.\n\nThe match against Turkey is likely to be a group decider and could determine which team will top the group.\n\nAlthough France looked confident in successive victories against Albania and Andorra, a string of injuries has left Didier Deschamps with a depleted squad.\n\nPaul Pogba is still ruled out with injury and was not selected for the squad, while captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris suffered a horrific elbow dislocation with Tottenham last weekend.\n\nThe long injury list also includes Ousmane Dembele, Benjamin Mendy and Barcelona's Samuel Umtiti.\n\nKylian Mbappe has also suffered from fitness problems lately, but has been selected for the squad.\n\nTurkey have also had a strong run in the qualifiers and will be confident of getting one over on France again.\n\nWales vs Croatia\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWales still have hopes to qualify for the Euros and land a top spot in Group E after Gareth Bale's late goal in Azerbaijan.\n\nAlthough World Cup finalists Croatia are favourites and current leaders of the group, they could only draw with the same opposition to give hope to the chasing pack.\n\nRyan Giggs's side must first face off against Slovakia, while Croatia will host Hungary, before the sides meet in Cardiff on Sunday.\n\nCroatia are currently ahead with 10 points followed by Slovakia and Hungary who both have 9 points and Wales in third place with 6 points.\n\nGiggs made clear his teams desire ahead of the fixture, and said: \"We want to go into the last camp with qualification in our hands.\"\n\nBrazil vs Senegal\n\n(Image: Offside via Getty Images)\n\nBrazil take on Senegal in another international friendly that sees two of Liverpool's front three in action on opposing sides.\n\nSadio Mane spearheads Senegal's attack, while Roberto Firmino will line-up for Brazil in Thursday's clash (1pm GMT).\n\nThe two countries will be meeting for the first time in Singapore where Brazil will also face off against Nigeria.\n\nThe five-time World Cup winners are looking to bounce back from their recent defeat to Peru, which saw their 17-game unbeaten run come to an end.\n\nThey will be tested against Senegal\u2019s young and aggressive side however, who made a big impression during last years World Cup.\n\nCzech Republic vs England\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nEngland are hoping to continue their winning streak on Friday when face off against the Czech Republic in Prague.\n\nThe Three Lions have won all four Euro 2020 qualifiers they have played and have scored an impressive 19 goals.\n\nThe Czech Republic are second in group A but England are their biggest challenge yet.\n\nGareth Southgate showed the team he means business when he announced the squad by leaving out team regulars Dele Alli, Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard.\n\nChelsea duo Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori have been drafted in for their first call-ups as Southgate continues his focus on handing youth a chance.\n\nThe two sides met in a one-sided clash at Wembley back in March, with England running out 5-0 winners.\n\nBut the Czech's have had a successful run since, and will be looking to make their home advantage count this time round.", "description": "Despite the lack of club action
