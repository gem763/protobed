The signs are everywhere.\n\nTrump just raised $15 million in one day ... in California. The biggest business leaders in America are betting on Trump ... even in ultra-liberal, ultra-blue California.\n\nBy way of comparison, California's own liberal darling Sen. Kamala Harris raised $12 million nationally ... over three months.\n\nThink about this for a moment. Trump was outspent by more than 2 to 1 in the 2016 election. Still, Hillary Clinton couldn't beat him.\n\nThis time around, Trump will have $2 billion to spend. Trump beat Clinton with $600 million. What chance do Democrats have against Trump and $2 billion?\n\nCNN also just got a dose of reality. It sent reporter Martin Savidge to Minnesota, a deep-blue Democratic stronghold where the blue-collar, working-class residents are lifelong Democrats. Everyone shown on camera said they are voting for Trump.\n\nWhy? Because anyone with a job and common sense can see the Democratic Party is insane. Elect any Democrat but former Vice President Joe Biden and it's clear you'll be out looking for work the day after the election.\n\nWith the Democrat plans to spend trillions on \"Medicare for All,\" trillions on free childcare, trillions on free college, trillions on free health care for illegals and tens of trillions on the infamous Green New Deal, America will be bankrupt and closed for business.\n\nCrazy, radical Democrats such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claim the world will end in 12 years. I don't know about the world, but I know the date the American Dream ends. Mark it down. If any Democrat other than Biden wins, it's Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020.\n\nI say this because the delusional media actually think, hope and pray that Biden is their savior. They think Biden can beat Trump. That's why they're rooting so hard for him.\n\nEven the liberal media clearly understand deep down that Democrats are headed for a landslide defeat in 2020 if they run anyone but Biden.\n\nBut Biden isn't their answer. The Democrats and their promotion department (i.e. the mainstream media) are delusional about Biden. Biden will never be the nominee. Great-grandpa Biden doesn't know where he is anymore. His mind is wandering off to imaginary fights with some thug named \"Corn Pop.\"\n\nBiden doesn't know what year it is. In a recent Democrat presidential debate, he asked voters to go to \"Joe 3-0-3-3-0.\" Folks, if you are so old you can't remember your website is JoeBiden.com, you can't be president. You belong in a nursing home.\n\nBiden doesn't know where he is. He was recently addressing the press in New Hampshire and said how much he loves it in Vermont.\n\nBiden doesn't know the population of America. Days ago, he boasted that his economic plan would put 720 million women back to work. There are only 330 million people in the country.\n\nPoor Joe wants to be president so badly. The liberal media want it so badly for him. But \"want\" doesn't cut it. Biden will never be president. Poor Joe just doesn't have it anymore. All the hopes and prayers in the world won't change that.\n\nBesides, I'll bet serious coin there's a photo out there of Biden in blackface. Ask the governor of Virginia. Or the attorney general of Virginia. Or Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada. All the hypocrite liberals who call others racist seem to have those blackface photos in their past.\n\nSo if I'm right and Biden will never be the nominee, what do the Democrats have? Wacko, extreme Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.\n\nGet ready for a Trump electoral landslide.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a CEO, entrepreneur, best-selling author, nationally syndicated talk show host on USA Radio Network and the host of \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" on Newsmax TV nightly at 8 p.m. ET.", "description": "Is President Donald Trump about to win reelection in a .09/22/2019 19:09:05PM EST.", "authors": ["Wayne Allyn Root", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/262/3e21e979-a011-4840-b9c1-b9adfac48b16.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
