That\u2019s one takeaway from new Long-Term Budget Outlook report by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe agency\u2019s long-term budget projections are bleak, with debt nearly doubling over the next 30 years. Yet we could avoid this ruinous fate if Congress reins in its sugar daddy propensities and prioritizes spending so that taxpayer dollars support truly essential constitutional functions.\n\nLawmakers serious about doing this need look no further than The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Blueprint for Balance. It shows Congress how it can balance the budget in 10 years and start paying off the national debt.\n\nThe first step to fiscal recovery is to implement strong spending restraints that force Washington to live within its means. Ever-growing entitlement spending and interest payments on the national debt are the two areas where spending is most out of control. Together, they are projected to account for nearly three-quarters of federal spending growth over the next decade.\n\nMedicare spending is projected to double in the next 30 years. Over the same period, Social Security and other health care programs are projected to grow by 26% and 43%, respectively.\n\nAs America racks up more debt, it becomes more expensive to pay the interest. The CBO estimates that, next year, Washington will spending more on interest payments than on Medicaid. In just six years, interest payments will outstrip defense spending. By 2041, CBO projects that entitlement spending and interest payments on the debt will consume all federal revenues.\n\nOne difficulty in getting entitlement spending under control is that it is on \u201cautopilot\u201d \u2014 Congress doesn\u2019t exercise direct control over the funds from year to year.\n\nHowever, Congress does control the other third of the budget known as discretionary spending.\n\nSince 2012, discretionary spending has been limited through the Budget Control Act\u2019s spending caps. Unfortunately, Congress\u2019s will to limit discretionary spending has been weak, leading to three budget mega-deals that have raised the caps by $440 billion over six years, with little of the new spending being paid for. The long-term debt implications of the deals is likely trillions of dollars.\n\nThe discretionary limits are set to expire in 2021, but some lawmakers would like to see one more deal to push the caps even higher. Earlier this year House Democrats put forth a plan to raise the caps by over $350 billion for the next two years. There was no plan to pay for it.\n\nIf lawmakers want to start fixing the nation\u2019s debt problem, they should start by rejecting another cap-raising deal and instead prioritize spending on essential federal functions, like national defense, while cutting other programs.\n\nTo truly stabilize the budget and pay down the national debt, discretionary cuts won\u2019t be enough. Congress must implement reforms to lessen the costs and ensure the long-term viability of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nThe sooner Congress starts these reforms, the better off young Americans will be. The longer Congress waits, the more significant and abrupt the policy changes (i.e. cuts to benefits, higher taxes, or both) will have to be.\n\nCBO suggests that younger Americans \u2014 and those yet to be born \u2014 would pay the heaviest price for Congressional inaction. The report states: \u201cDelaying policy changes would reduce the well-being of younger generations compared with a situation in which policy changes occurred earlier.\u201d\n\nFuture generations would likely have lower incomes than their parents and see less economic opportunity throughout their lives.\n\nTo ensure our country\u2019s continued prosperity, Congress must implement a strong budget framework that reduces the national debt and restores sanity to budgeting. If lawmakers fail to do so, we will all pay a price, but our children and grandchildren could pay the highest price of all.", "description": "America\u2019s national debt is out of control, and the youngest Americans and future generations will likely pay the biggest price.
