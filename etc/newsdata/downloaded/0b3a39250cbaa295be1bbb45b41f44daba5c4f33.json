The latest is JPMorgan, who maintained their overweight rating and bumped their price target from $50 to $65. With shares ending last week near $49, the price target implies almost $16 in upside, or more than 30%.\n\nBulls on Board\n\nHarlan Sur of JPMorgan says that NAND pricing is ahead of their expectations, while DRAM is relatively in line with their expectations. Further, he expects next quarter to mark the trough in gross margins, while an \u201cinflection in [the] cloud data center\u201d should help drive revenue. Strong demand for gaming, PCs and smartphones should also help.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJPMorgan analysts aren\u2019t the only the ones bullish on Micron, though.\n\nLast week, Micron also caught a price target boost from $55 to $65 at Cascend Securities. The analysts maintain a buy rating and believe MU has \u201cgood value\u201d after evaluating the DRAM market.\n\nAmong the bullish camp, many are forecasting and making similar observations with their channel checks. That is, many expect margins to bottom in the next quarter or two and for demand to stabilize and improve in Micron\u2019s end markets.\n\nNow, can it get to $65?\n\nTrading MU Stock\n\nBack in April, we were looking for a breakout over the $44 to $45 area. MU stock had all the hallmarks of an ascending triangle, a bullish technical pattern. Rising uptrend support (blue line) was squeezing the stock into a static level of resistance (purple line). In this case, that resistance came into play between $44 to $45.\n\nIf MU stock price closed above this mark, it could have potentially continued higher as it broke out. Instead, the charts unwound and Micron stock took a tumble. Shares finally put in a double bottom down near $32.\n\nFor now, shares are holding up above $49. This is where MU topped out after it finally pushed through $45 resistance. After another brief fall below $45 and another breakout, shares ran to $51.39, the September higher. I would love to see MU consolidate above $49, with the 20-day moving average trending higher.\n\nHowever, investors won\u2019t have long to wait for some action. Micron stock reports earnings on Thursday. While it\u2019s not guaranteed to be volatile, most of its post-earnings moves pack quite a punch.\n\nOn the upside, look to see if MU stock can close above the September highs at $51.39. That could send it on its next breakout higher, putting a $65 price target that much closer. If $49 fails as support, as does the 20-day moving average, it\u2019s vital that $44 to $45 \u2014 prior resistance \u2014 acts as support.\n\nIf it does, or if the 50-day supports MU stock, it may be a dip-buying opportunity.\n\nBottom Line on Micron Stock\n\nThe trouble with MU stock? Supply and demand \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about the actual stock. I\u2019m talking about memory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf demand dries up and/or supply is too high in the DRAM and NAND markets, companies like Micron suffer. Others come under pressure too, like Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).\n\nFor this quarter, analysts expect Micron\u2019s revenue to decline almost 46% year-over-year to $4.57 billion. Further, they expect an 84.2% decline in earnings to 48 cents per share.", "description": "Shares of Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have been on a cautious rise lately as investors and analysts worry less and less about the DRAM and NAND market.
