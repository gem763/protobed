It was weird to think Trump was just a few miles away, Kimmel said, \u201cin his hyperbaric tanning chamber eating all our Popeye\u2019s chicken sandwiches\u201d.\n\nTrump is not popular in Los Angeles \u2013 he lost the city \u201cby about 50 points, and it\u2019s gone down from there\u201d, Kimmel said. So who would host such an unpopular figure in the city? Geoff Palmer, a billionaire, who, Kimmel pointed out, is accused of ripping off his tenants in a class-action lawsuit. \u201cBelieve it or not, they have a lot in common,\u201d Kimmel said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u201ctestified\u201d before the House judiciary committee \u2013 as in, he \u201cdodged and stonewalled\u201d every question, according to Kimmel. Lewandowski was part of the House panel\u2019s first official \u201cimpeachment meeting\u201d \u2013 though many Democrats still aren\u2019t onboard with the idea of impeaching Trump.\n\nFor those still on the fence, Kimmel offered a pitch: the impeachment process would take months, with hours upon hours of testimony and hearings \u201call for our couch potato president to take in. He\u2019ll be so busy watching and tweeting about it that just maybe he\u2019ll forget all the other terrible things he wants to do.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert on Kavanaugh: 'I didn't think I'd ever be talking about this again' Read more\n\nHouse Democrats should consider that \u201cimpeachment is a good way to distract Donald Trump with the subject he cares about the most\u201d \u2013 himself. \u201cBasically, our president is an unruly child throwing a tantrum while we try to eat dinner at a restaurant,\u201d Kimmel explained, \u201cand impeachment is an iPad loaded with Paw Patrol.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert: \u2018Your rallies do set a low bar\u2019\n\nStephen Colbert celebrated his 800th Late Show on Tuesday night, a milestone he\u2019ll also celebrate at this weekend\u2019s Emmys in Los Angeles. It\u2019s fitting that Trump was also in Los Angeles during Emmy week, Colbert said, since \u201che is up for outstanding achievement in visual effects for a Sharpie on a weather map\u201d.\n\nSure, Trump is unpopular in California, Colbert explained on the rationale for an LA fundraiser, but \u201cHollywood is a thin layer of dirt, scattered over a pool of money \u2013 everyone wants to get their drill bit through that crust into that sweet, bubbling cash crude. They\u2019re largely liberal, but there\u2019s enough money that everyone, no matter how horrible, gets funded.\u201d\n\nTrump is, according to Colbert, the \u201cEmoji Movie of candidates\u201d \u2013 backed by some but desperate enough to appeal to people who likely want nothing to do with him, such as Latino voters in New Mexico.\n\nTrump hosted a rally in the state Monday evening, where he tried to appeal to Latino voters \u201cafter four years of throwing Latinos under the bus that he stopped at the border, by saying that illegal and legal immigrants are all coming to kill us\u201d, Colbert marveled.\n\n\u201cTrump has gotten a lot of criticism for his racist immigration policies, but he doesn\u2019t understand why,\u201d Colbert reflected on one segment of Trump\u2019s speech in which he claimed he\u2019s \u201cthe least racist person in this room\u201d.\n\n\u201cWell \u2026 maybe. Your rallies do set a low bar,\u201d quipped Colbert.\n\nTrevor Noah: \u2019Like a much less successful 50 Cent\u2019\n\nOn the Daily Show, Trevor Noah told the Tale of Two Rallies, starting with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s in downtown Manhattan. Warren received loud cheers for her proposed wealth tax, in which multimillionaires were taxed two cents on every dollar after $50m, which got the crowd of 20,000 people chanting \u201ctwo cents, two cents, two cents\u201d.\n\n\u201cNot only is that a great chant, it also sounds like the name of a much less successful 50 Cent,\u201d Noah joked.\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) In dueling rallies, Warren discusses her plans for a wealth tax while Trump talks about\u2026 lightbulbs? pic.twitter.com/I9jcZMhNcC\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s rally in New Mexico, in which he tried to cater to Latino voters, \u201cgot a little uncomfortable\u201d.\n\nAt one point, Trump asked conservative commentator Steve Cortes: \u201cWhat do you like more, the country or the Hispanics?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in brown Jesus\u2019s name was that?\u201d Noah asked, incredulous. \u201cThose two things aren\u2019t even in the same category! \u2018What do you like more: Pepsi or Mongolia?\u2019\u201d It was also a bad question, Noah continued, \u201cbecause it implies that Hispanics aren\u2019t a part of the country\u201d.\n\nTrump also decried US energy regulations on lightbulbs, telling the crowd: \u201cThey took away our lightbulbs. I want an incandescent light, I want to look better.\u201d\n\n\u201cYep, that\u2019s right \u2013 Trump wants to roll back energy regulations instituted by Bush and completed by Obama because he thinks he looks better under old lightbulbs,\u201d Noah said, noting that \u201cthere are much easier ways to look better than rewriting US energy policy.\u201d He could try a normal haircut, or a suit that fits, or \u201cjust standing next to Stephen Miller\u201d.", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed the \u2018impeachment hearing\u2019, Trump\u2019s pitch to Latino voters, and why lightbulbs make him look orange", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d32086e5a8ea9ed3273151cd50c5695b3d0159d/100_0_1510_906/master/1510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=437a786037ed1f58a3d2db5a9fbab9f7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
