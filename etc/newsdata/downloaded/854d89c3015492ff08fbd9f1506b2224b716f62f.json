They appear ready to impose new laws that would make a United States rollout impossible, including the so-called \u201cKeep Big Tech out of Finance\u201d bill.\n\nMarcus has retorted that blocking Facebook\u2019s project could backfire on American lawmakers, however, as China and other nations are known to be forging away behind the scenes on digital fiat and cryptocurrency projects that could effectively end the dollar\u2019s control over the world economy.\n\nMarcus warned American regulators that they risked \u201chaving a whole part of the world completely blocked from United States sanctions and protected from United States sanctions \u2013 and having a new digital reserve currency [with no alternative].\u201d\n\nBloomberg also quotes a \u201cformer leader\u201d and crypto-pioneer of China\u2019s central bank as stating that \u201ca goal of the country\u2019s project was to keep China from having to adopt a standard, like Bitcoin, designed and controlled by others.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Libra appears to have finally found an ally in the American parliament. Republican senator for South Dakota Mike Rounds, a member of the Senate\u2019s banking committee, has written a letter to Libra partner Anchorage, expressing his support for the companies that are continuing to back Facebook\u2019s forthcoming cryptocurrency.\n\nRounds, who has served in the senate since 2014, CCed his letter to all of the other members of Libra\u2019s Governance Council. He wrote, in a thinly veiled critique of senate- and congress-based attacks on Libra in recent months,\n\n\u201cIt would be unfortunate to shun a new solution that could connect more of the most vulnerable Americans to our financial services system.\u201d\n\nRounds added that the United States was in serious danger of falling behind the rest of the world, with cryptocurrency usage and infrastructure in regions like Africa already fast outstripping America.\n\nHe also called the opposition to Libra by fellow politicians \u201cpuzzling,\u201d and called the American legal and regulatory system that is being applied to cryptocurrencies \u201carchaic and inflexible.\u201d", "description": "Facebook\u2019s blockchain chief David Marcus has warned Washington that stopping the launch of Libra will open the door for China to steal a key advantage in the world of digital currencies.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5da/944c6be23c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
