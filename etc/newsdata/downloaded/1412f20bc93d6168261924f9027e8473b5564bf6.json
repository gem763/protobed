Its government is spending at least 2% of gross domestic product on defense, a benchmark that Mr. Trump would like other member countries to meet.\n\n\u201cAmerica and Poland will continue to stand with all of our allies for our common defense,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cAnd America and Poland will also continue to call on all our allies to live up to the promises that we\u2019ve made to one another.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump was scheduled to address the somber crowd in Warsaw but canceled his visit to monitor Hurricane Dorian, which slammed into the Bahamas as a Category 5 storm Sunday and inched toward the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nMr. Trump spent hours Saturday at his golf club in Virginia, raising some eyebrows after he scrapped his appearance in Poland.\n\nWhite House aides said he was briefed on the storm each hour and wanted to remain \u201cnimble\u201d by staying in the U.S. with his agency directors instead of traveling overseas as planned.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda presided over Sunday\u2019s ceremony, which recalled the German invasion on Sept. 1, 1939.\n\nWorld War II devastated Poland. It lost millions of citizens, including much of its Jewish population, and rebuilt itself as part of the Eastern Bloc before instituting a non-communist government in 1989.\n\nMr. Pence hailed the \u201clong roll call of Polish heroes\u201d who fought for the triumph of good over the Nazis\u2019 \u201cevil ideology, based on racial conquest and authoritarian rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remember those that were lost on this day, but we also do well to celebrate an enduring victory for freedom and the role that the people of Poland played by their strength and their example,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nHe highlighted American sacrifices in the war, \u201cwith honor and gratitude.\u201d\n\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who spoke before Mr. Pence, acknowledged his nation\u2019s \u201cpainful\u201d legacy in the conflict.\n\n\u201cWe will not forget the wounds that Germans inflicted on Poland and the Polish people,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said.\n\nHe also addressed Mr. Pence directly, saying the U.S. and Europe must preserve the partnership they forged after the war.\n\n\u201cEurope needs partners, and I am certain that the United States also needs partners in this world,\u201d Mr. Steinmeier said. \u201cLet us look after this partnership.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence reassured one U.S. partner, Ukraine, that Americans would stand by its side.\n\n\u201cI can assure you, Mr. President, that the relationship between the United States and Ukraine has never been stronger,\u201d Mr. Pence told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a former comedic actor who was elected in April, during a sit-down Sunday in Warsaw.\n\nMr. Pence offered those assurances amid reports that Mr. Trump is slow-walking $250 million in planned security aid to Ukraine, saying he wants to be sure it is spent wisely.\n\nMr. Pence ignored reporters\u2019 questions about the aid, though said he is looking forward to discussing Russia\u2019s compliance with the Minsk accords, which established a cease-fire amid skirmishes in eastern Ukraine.\n\nEuropean leaders want Russia to comply with the accords before it considers its readmission to the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, even as Mr. Trump is pushing hard to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin back into the fold.\n\nRussia was removed from the group for annexing Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nMr. Pence said the Trump administration has \u201cstood with the people of Ukraine and most especially since 2014, we have stood strongly for the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you,\u201d he said, \u201cthat we will continue to stand with the people of Ukraine on your security, on territorial integrity, including Ukraine\u2019s rightful claim to Crimea.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
