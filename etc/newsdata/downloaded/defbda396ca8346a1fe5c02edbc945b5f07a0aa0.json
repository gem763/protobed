The latest example: a new camera-focused app for messaging close friends -- which reads like a product description for rival Snapchat (SNAP).\n\nFacebook FB On Thursday, the-owned company announced a new app called Threads, which is a complementary app to Instagram that lets users connect and share messages with a smaller group of friends. While the Threads app offers its own inbox for messages, you'll still be able to read and respond to your close friends in the primary Instagram app.\n\nThe app pulls in your Close Friends list on Instagram, a feature that lets you pick which friends you want to share Stories with. Only you control the list, meaning people can't request to be on it. You can also add or remove people at any point and they won't be notified.\n\nShares of Snapchat's parent company Snap were down as much as 7% in midday trading Thursday following the product launch.\n\nLike on Instagram (and Snapchat), Threads users can message close friends and send them disappearing photos and videos. You can also share a custom status on the app or opt into the automatic status tool, which uses your location and phone data to let friends know that you're at home, work, or the movies or that your phone is running low on battery. The status function won't expose your exact coordinates, and Instagram promises the location information collected won't be used for ads, nor will the location information be stored on Instagram's servers.", "description": "Instagram just can't stop copying Snapchat.
