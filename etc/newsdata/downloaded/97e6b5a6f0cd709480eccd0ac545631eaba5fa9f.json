Not that he spent much time there.\n\nThat was the problem for Thomas. Thomas signed with the Patriots in the offseason, was cut before the season and brought back. Then, for the brief instant it seemed Antonio Brown would be a part of the Patriots all season, New England traded Thomas to the New York Jets.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWith the Jets about to face the Patriots on Monday night, Thomas was still a bit miffed that Patriots coach Bill Belichick yanked him around.\n\nDemaryius Thomas felt insulted by Pats\n\nIn an interview with Manish Mehta of the New York Daily News, Thomas said he wasn\u2019t happy with how the Patriots treated him.\n\n\u201cIt was insulting, for sure,\u201d Thomas told the Daily News. \u201cOnce I got cut [on August 31], I could have just come here [to the Jets] and not stayed there and re-sign. When they re-signed me, I was thinking that I was good. Two weeks later, I was gone. So, it\u2019s like, \u2018Why did I waste my time?\u2019 Because at the end of the day, it was kind of a waste of time for me.\u201d\n\nThomas has had a good career. He\u2019s a former first-round pick, a four-time Pro Bowler and won a Super Bowl ring with the Denver Broncos. He said, when he decided to come back after being cut, that the Patriots told him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo weeks later, AB gets cut\u2026 and then they kicked me [to the curb] and shipped me out like I\u2019m just a rookie,\u201d Thomas told Mehta.\n\nThomas gets to face Patriots on Monday night\n\nThe NFL is a cold, tough business. And nobody is better at that business than the Patriots.\n\nWhen it looked like the Patriots couldn\u2019t use Thomas, they shipped him off. He said he felt disrespected. But things like that happen in the NFL.\n\nStory continues\n\nThomas said his time was wasted because he could have signed with the Jets when he was cut the first time, in late August. He eventually landed on the Jets and has played a lot the last couple weeks. The Patriots are doing just fine too, at 6-0.\n\nOfficially, Thomas never appeared in a game with the Patriots. But he\u2019ll remember his time there. Just not with many good memories.\n\nNew York Jets wide receiver Demaryius Thomas wasn't happy with how he was treated by the Patriots.
