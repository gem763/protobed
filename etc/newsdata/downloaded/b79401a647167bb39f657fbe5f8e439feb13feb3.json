XRP price could retest the $0.2800 support area before a fresh increase.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, we saw a massive rally in ripple price above the $0.3000 resistance against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair even broke the $0.3120 resistance and posted a new monthly high. A swing high was formed near $0.3272 before the price started a downside correction. There was a sharp decline below the $0.3150 and $0.3050 support levels to start the current correction.\n\nAdditionally, there was a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last major rally from the $0.2562 low to $0.3272 high. More importantly, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.3050 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair is now trading close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the last major rally from the $0.2562 low to $0.3272 high.\n\nThe next key support is near the $0.2850 and $0.2840 levels. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last major rally from the $0.2562 low to $0.3272 high is near the $0.2835 level. Therefore, the price is likely to find a decent buying interest if it reaches close to the $0.2800 support area. If there are more downsides, the next major support is near the $0.2650 level (the previous resistance area).\n\nOn the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.3000 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.3050 on the same chart. If there is an upside break above the $0.3050 resistance, the price could resume its uptrend. The next key resistances are near the $0.3200 and $0.3250 levels.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is declining sharply and trimming gains below $0.3000. However, the $0.2850 and $0.2800 support levels are likely to stop the current decline in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is currently gaining momentum in the bearish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently declining and is well below the 50 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2850, $0.2800 and $0.2650.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.3000, $0.3050 and $0.3200.", "description": "Ripple price is correcting gains from the recent high against the US Dollar and bitcoin.
