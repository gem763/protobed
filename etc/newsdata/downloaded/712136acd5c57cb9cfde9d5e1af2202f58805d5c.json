Yet mum Sarah insists on getting up early every morning for the ten-minute drive to school.\n\nWork and meetings are arranged around this commitment. The school run, she says, is non-negotiable.\n\nAccording to last year\u2019s National Traffic Survey, 57 per cent of 11 to 16-year-olds are taken to school by an adult, compared to 31 per cent in 2014. In the Seventies, almost every 11-year-old made their way to school alone.\n\nSome might call this yet more mollycoddling by modern mothers, another example of helicopter parents refusing to let their children grow up.\n\nExperts revealed why some mothers become attached to taking their children to school, Sarah Agar-Brennan, 46, (pictured) from Leeds, says taking her son Daniel, 16, to school is a 'guilty pleasure'\n\nNot so, says Sarah Agar-Brennan. \u2018Daniel likes the extra half hour he gets in bed versus taking the bus. My motivation is it gives me treasured time with him,\u2019 admits Sarah, 46, an enterprise coach, who lives in Leeds with software consultant husband Carl, 45.\n\nThe couple have a daughter, Ellie, 18, at university in Paris \u2014 another reason Sarah\u2019s clinging on to the school run. \u2018In a few years he\u2019ll be gone, like Ellie,\u2019 she adds.\n\nConsultant psychologist Dr Elena Touroni says there are various reasons why mothers of older children become so attached to the school run.\n\n\u2018Perhaps parents aren\u2019t accepting their children are a bit more grown up and can do certain things by themselves,\u2019 explains Dr Touroni, co-founder of the Chelsea Psychology Clinic.\n\n\u2018Equally the school run can bring a lot of valuable enjoyment. The important thing is that parents facilitate a normal exploration of the world, and children feel able to say if they\u2019d prefer to take the bus with their friends.\u2019\n\nWhen Sarah\u2019s children were little they lived in rural North Yorkshire where walking or getting the bus to school wasn\u2019t possible. When they moved to Leeds eight years ago, she recalls feeling briefly resentful. \u2018The kids\u2019 schools weren\u2019t within walking distance and I remember thinking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t there be a school bus?\u201d Then I realised how much I loved all the things we did in the car, listening to Harry Potter audio books, singing and making up rhymes.\n\n\u2018Most importantly, it was when Ellie and Daniel felt able to chat about any anxieties.\u2019\n\nBy the time they went to senior school and a bus route was available, Sarah was emotionally invested in their daily routine.\n\nJacqueline White, 41, (pictured) from Kent, claims she takes her son Ethan, 14, to school because she fears that he would get bullied on the bus\n\nThankfully for her, Daniel says he\u2019s not embarrassed about being taken to school by his mum.\n\n\u2018Lots of kids get dropped off,\u2019 he says. \u2018Mum just drives past and I jump out. I\u2019m always tired, so that extra 30 minutes sleep really sorts me out. I\u2019m grateful to Mum.\u2019\n\nSarah, meanwhile, is adamant she\u2019s no helicopter parent: \u2018They\u2019re more inclined to talk when they\u2019ve just got out of school rather than at home where there are other distractions. I\u2019m not an overbearing mother, we just love spending time as a family.\u2019\n\nAs for her carbon footprint, Sarah says she offsets her 50 miles a week on the road by eating organic, locally sourced food, is vegan and buys sustainable clothes. The school run is her \u2018guilty pleasure\u2019.\n\nJacqueline White spends almost three hours a day in the car taking her middle child, Ethan, 14, to and from his grammar school. \u2018It can take 40 minutes each way and costs around \u00a340 a week in fuel.\n\n\u2018But I have a small car with a stop-start function to cut down on emissions,\u2019 says Jacqueline, 41, a Kent-based therapist specialising in stroke rehabilitation.\n\nSo why the extra hassle? Jacqueline, who has two other children, Tiegan, 18, and Ewan, eight, is convinced her son would be bullied on the bus. \u2018He\u2019s short, shy and geeky \u2014 a classic target.\u2019\n\nSally Keane, 57, (pictured) from Worcestershire, takes the opportunity to have in-depth conversations with her daughters Annabel and Charlotte during school runs\n\nSheela Mackintosh-Stewart, a relationship expert and family lawyer, says this is a common worry. \u2018Mothers may be afraid of what their children may get up to or be faced with when they\u2019re not around. By doing the school run, they can keep an eye on them.\u2019 Jacqueline, who is married to Montague, 51, a photographer, got her school run habit when Tiegan developed a condition at 13, which caused her knees and ankles to swell.\n\nFor a year she was unable to walk between bus stops, home and school, so Jacqueline, started taking her by car. When Tiegan recovered, neither wanted to give up their shared journey. \u2018Then when Ethan started secondary school there was no question of me sending him off to the bus stop,\u2019 Jacqueline adds.\n\n\u2018Ethan\u2019s got a cracking personality but, as the middle child between a domineering sister and a demanding little brother, he doesn\u2019t have much of a voice at home. In the car, he opens up to me about everything from school to friendships, and issues his friends are having that they\u2019ve confided in him. It\u2019s an opportunity for me to help him.\u2019\n\nSo devoted is Carrie Winnall to her twin 13-year-olds\u2019 school run that when they went up to secondary school two years ago she took the extraordinary step of changing jobs to keep it up.\n\n\u2018I had no choice but to drive them to primary school because it was a two-mile walk away down country lanes,\u2019 says Carrie, 47, who works in admin and lives in Devon with husband Matt, 48, a purchasing manager, and twins Gracie and Jaydn.\n\nCarrie Winnall, 47, (pictured) from Devon, cherishes taking her twins to school and even changed job to keep it up\n\n\u2018Before they started secondary school we talked about the bus, as I\u2019d have been driving them in the opposite direction to my work. I then decided to look for a new job instead of relinquishing that time with my children. I cherish our 20-minute journey,\u2019 she explains. \u2018My daughter in particular uses it to talk through any worries.\u2019\n\nMum of four Sally Keane regrets not doing the school run with her eldest pair, which is why she\u2019s now devoted to dropping her younger two off \u2014 despite spending two and a half hours a day ferrying Annabel, 12, and Charlotte, 15, to their schools.\n\n\u2018When my older kids were growing up I was working full time. I never had the luxury of doing the school run,\u2019 explains Sally, 57, a life coach who is married and lives in Worcestershire.\n\n\u2018My eldest often says she\u2019d have loved me to pick her up, which has made me determined to do this for Annabel and Charlotte. Charlotte is at a precarious age but feels reassured by spending time with me and offloads about her day.\n\n\u2018Because it\u2019s a longer journey we have time for those in-depth conversations. When we get home she disappears to her room like teenagers do.\u2019\n\nStill, the girls have rules: Mum has to wait down the road from the school gates, and giving them a hug or kiss is a no-no.\n\nBut Sally adds: \u2018So many parents resent the school run, yet when you can\u2019t do it you realise it\u2019s something precious.\u2019", "description": "Experts weighed in on why mothers of older children can become attached to the school run.
