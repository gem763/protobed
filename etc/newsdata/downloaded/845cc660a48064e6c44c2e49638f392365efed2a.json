With outraged mime, honking horns and impotent balloons, Out of Order is a reflection on the messy world we live in, where what we lack in meaningful dialogue, we make up for in unfiltered aggression.\n\nIn matching tartan suits and white face paint, six unsmiling performers grind themselves through a series of silent meetings, each ending in one person leaping over the table to clutch at the throat of another. The others try to hold them back, chucking chairs when arms won\u2019t reach. They claw and grapple, clambering over bodies as if they don\u2019t know how flesh can bruise. The performers aren\u2019t young; you feel how each fight strains them, their painted faces drooping with sweat. Games of follow-the-leader end up spinning in circles. Violent spats end with no consequence but exhaustion, the fights nothing more than weary ritual.\n\nThe sister piece to the bum-numbing Real Magic, in which a single scene was repeated ad nauseam, Out of Order can easily serve as a metaphor for our era of buffoonish, brutish leadership, uncooperative and unhelpful in unending negotiations. But kick it backwards or forwards a decade or two and the show loses none of its potency \u2013 just keep booting until you find another group of suits sitting round a table failing to compromise.\n\nWhere it feels truly current is in its criticism of communication; the way we blindly follow and drown each other out. Out of Order may test our patience and push past the point of laughter, but by pinballing between childish hysteria and tumbleweed brutality, it mirrors our own absurdity; an uncommunicative society led by a bunch of clowns.\n\n\u2022 At the Southbank Centre, London, until 14 October. Then at Home, Manchester, 13-15 November, and Attenborough Centre for the Creative Arts, Brighton, 19 November.", "description": "Our era of buffoonish leadership is brilliantly skewered in Forced Entertainment\u2019s mimed maelstrom of aggression", "authors": ["Kate Wyver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb1bb5dbf1ad29322deed169973513f7a05023f/224_527_3574_2145/master/3574.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ee6e8c668a5ebec6fd59f082d65c20ea", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
