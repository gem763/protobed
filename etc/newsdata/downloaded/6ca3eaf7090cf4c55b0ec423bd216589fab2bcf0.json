The former first-round pick completed only 7-of-18 pass attempts for 63 yards. He also threw two interceptions and finished with a dismal 9.5 quarterback rating.\n\nTitans head coach Mike Vrabel told reporters after the game that he will discuss the team\u2019s quarterback situation with general manager Jon Robinson and his coaching staff before making a decision on who will start in Week 7 against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let you know as soon as I figure it out and do what\u2019s best for the team,\u201d Vrabel said.\n\nThe Titans selected Mariota with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Oregon. The signal-caller is in the final season of his rookie contract.\n\nMariota also struggled in the Titans\u2019 loss to the Buffalo Bills last week, completing less than 60 percent of his passes with no touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel great,\u201d Mariota told reporters Sunday. \u201cCoach [Vrabel] made a decision, and he\u2019s going to make a decision that\u2019s best for the team. I respect it, and I just try to be there for Ryan.\u201d\n\nIn relief of Mariota, Tannehill, a former first-rounder for the Miami Dolphins in 2012, completed 13-of-16 throws for 144 yards but also tossed an interception.", "description": "Oct. 13 (UPI) \u2014 The Tennessee Titans benched starting quarterback Marcus Mariota in favor of Ryan Tannehill during the team\u2019s 16-0 loss to the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
