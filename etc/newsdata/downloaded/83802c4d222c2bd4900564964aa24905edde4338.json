If the answer is no, we have a deal that you won\u2019t want to pass up. The Instant Pot Ultra is the elevated version of the original, best-selling Instant Pot and it\u2019s on sale for $84.\n\nUnlike the classic Instant Pot Duo, the Ultra has a sleek central dial that allows you to easily and precisely control your cooking. It has a cooking indicator to give you a full read on what your food is doing, a steam release reset button in case you released too early, and an attitude adjustment for those who live way above or below sea level (yes, this affects how you cook). The Ultra also has a microprocessor that gives you all the high-tech reads you could need to create a meal that\u2019s unlike any you\u2019ve had. You can customize temperature, set your own custom programming, or use one of the new programs like to perfectly bake a cake or sterilize the inner pot. Basically, the Instant Pot Ultra does everything for you and if that\u2019s not what the future promised, I don\u2019t know what is. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
