Hong Kong Bank Profits Seen Falling 67% in JPMorgan's Worst Case\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Months of protests, a worsening economy and a plunge in property prices could translate into severe pain for Hong Kong\u2019s banks, and threatens to end the city\u2019s status as a \u201csafe haven\u201d for customers\u2019 savings, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co.\n\nA stress test performed by the U.S. bank projected that local lenders including Bank Co. and Bank of East Asia Ltd. could see earnings slump 24% to 45% next year and 39% to 67% in 2021. That would lead to significant deterioration in return on equity and core capital buffers, analysts led by Jemmy Huang told clients in a note Monday.\n\nThey downgraded Bank to underweight from neutral and said they are taking a \u201ccautious\u201d view of lenders in the city.\n\n\u201cThe social unrest in Hong Kong has persisted for more than four months and shows no signs of moderation,\u201d Huang wrote.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government has laid out policy support including boosting loans to small businesses and cutting banks\u2019 capital buffers to mitigate an economic downturn, \u201chistory suggests a sustainable rally would not come through until the underlying issues are resolved,\u201d Huang said. Hong Kong banks probably won\u2019t outperform the benchmark in the next six to 12 months, he predicted.\n\nHong Kong may report negative growth this year as the economy reels from the social unrest, Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote in a blog post on Sunday. Once Asia\u2019s manufacturing powerhouse before the rise of mainland China, Hong Kong\u2019s freewheeling consumer and finance-led economy is vulnerable to a potential collapse in confidence triggered by the turmoil.\n\nDeclines in residential prices, retail and office rents threaten higher credit costs on mortgages and property loans while potential capital outflow and the monetary authority\u2019s intervention will hurt banks\u2019 net interest margin. Overseas loans, trade finance, and lending to wholesale and retail sectors also could be impacted, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) said.\n\nBank, controlled HSBC Holdings Plc (LON: ), is likely to be hit the most among peers due to its higher leverage and concentration of Hong Kong-dollar denominated portfolio, the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said. Shares of Hang Seng Bank have lost 6% this year while Bank of East Asia tumbled 23%.\n\nBOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. may fare better given its sufficient capital position to sustain dividend yields even under stress tests, according to the note.", "description": "Hong Kong Bank Profits Seen Falling 67% in JPMorgan's Worst Case", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC2505T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
