So the last thing we want to do is spend hours of our precious free time in the gym.\n\nAnd spending more time working out isn\u2019t always necessarily efficient or effective. Short, sharp workouts can have more of an impact on your overall health goals \u2013 as long as you know what you\u2019re doing.\n\nMany personal trainers and even the NHS say that you can get fit with as little as 15 minutes of exercise per day \u2013 but if you\u2019re compressing your workouts, you want to make sure they\u2019re as efficient as possible.\n\nDavid Wiener, training specialist at fitness app Freeletics, has given us his top tips on how to get a brilliant workout in just 15 minutes. Think of all the things you\u2019ll be able to do with all that extra free time\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlan your workout\n\nOne of the best ways to save time when it comes to exercising is to use your time wisely and plan your workouts.\n\nIf you arrive at the gym with no plan, you\u2019ll likely waste time thinking about what to do next, and not only does this waste time, it can reduce the quality of your workout.\n\nIf you\u2019re unsure where to start, a fitness app can guide you through a full-body workout which is tailored to your individual goals and how long you\u2019re able to spend training.\n\nMinimise distractions\n\nUndoubtedly the best way to make the most out of a short workout is to minimise distractions and focus on the task at hand.\n\nFor some, this may mean exercising alone with a motivating playlist, rather than with a friend.\n\nIt may mean switching off the notifications on your phone, so you\u2019re not tempted to answer phone calls or reply to texts and emails.\n\nAlso, try keeping your rest periods short so you\u2019re not tempted to waste time.\n\nTry supersets to speed things up (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nHIIT it\n\nHigh Intensity Interval Training or HIIT, as it\u2019s better known, is the best way to get an effective, quick workout.\n\nInterval training is a great way to increase your fitness levels and calorie burn and it\u2019s performed by alternating intense periods of physical activity with short periods of rest so that your body can recover briefly before you up the intensity again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only is this style of working out a great time saver, its brilliant for building endurance and boosting the metabolism.\n\nUtilise your bodyweight\n\nBodyweight training is incredibly effective, and one of the beauties of this style of training is that you don\u2019t need any equipment, meaning you\u2019ll spend less time waiting around to use the machines or the free weights.\n\nIt\u2019s an incredibly versatile way of training, and you don\u2019t even need to be in the gym.\n\nIf you\u2019re really pushed for time you can get a quick, effective full-body workout wherever you are, and whenever works best for you.\n\nGive yourself a time limit\n\nSetting yourself a time limit is a great way to maximise the time you spend in the gym ensuring that you make every second count.\n\nIf you find that your workouts are taking too long, set a timer and race against the clock, this will make your workouts faster and more efficient.\n\nHave a back-up in case the equipment you wanted to use isn\u2019t free (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nAce your warm-up\n\nWarming up before exercising is very important as it helps to prevent injury and prepare your body for the workout ahead.\n\nA proper warm-up should last between five to ten minutes, but there are clever ways to speed this up and save time.\n\nStart by foam rolling for two-three minutes followed by a quick, dynamic series of mountain climbers, jumping jacks, arm and leg lifts, and hip raises.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmbrace supersets\n\nThey may sound scary, but supersets are a great way to save time and get an effective workout.\n\nIn simple terms, a superset is when you do two different exercises back to back without taking a break.\n\nShortening the rest period will also increase the intensity of your workout and doing more movements in a shorter space of time will equate to increased energy expenditure, upping your calorie burn.\n\nMake a back-up plan\n\nThere are never any guarantees that the equipment you want to use will be free, so in addition to your planned workout, it\u2019s a good idea to have a back-up plan that you can turn to if the equipment you want to use is busy.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re planning to use the bench press and it\u2019s busy, you could try even weighted push-ups.\n\nOr if the stair masters are a no go you could try doing steps ups.\n\nYou could even substitute the treadmill for the cross trainer and vice versa as they offer a similar body mechanical movement.\n\nMORE: If you feel stressed from a long week \u2013 don\u2019t go to the gym tonight\n\nMORE: The hottest fitness trends for 2020\n\nMORE: The fitness industry is overwhelmingly white \u2013 and that needs to change\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A personal trainer gives us his top tips on how to get an effective, full-body workout in no time at all.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/working-out-7972_1569912662.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
