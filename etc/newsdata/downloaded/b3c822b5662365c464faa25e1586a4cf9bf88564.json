That doesn't make any sense! I'm not in tabloids!' I didn't get it.\"\n\nMarkle also revealed that although she \"really tried to adopt the British sensibility of a stiff upper lip,\" she has struggled with the ongoing scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\"It's not enough to just survive something, right?\" she said. \"That's not the point of life. You've got to thrive, you've got to feel happy.\"\n\nShortly after the documentary aired, it was reported that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince William were concerned for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThere were also rumours that Markle and Prince Harry might take a sabbatical, or even a permanent departure, from their royal roles.\n\nBut Markle appeared to put that behind her, at least briefly, as she stepped out on Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nThe duchess was all smiles and looked glamorous in a long purple Aritzia dress that she previously wore while pregnant with baby Archie back in January.\n\nAnd the summit was the perfect place for Markle to step back into the spotlight after an especially difficult month.\n\n\n\nThe duchess has been working with One Young World since 2014, two years before she started dating Prince Harry, when she was named a Counsellor at the 2014 Summit in Dublin and spoke to the young attendees about equality and women's rights.\n\nAfter she became the Duchess of Sussex, Markle was allowed to maintain her ties with the nonprofit, which has since partnered with the Queen's Commonwealth Trust.\n\n\"It was very difficult for Meghan to close the chapter on her previous passions, so she's been excited to be able to join One Young World again this year in London,\" a friend told Vanity Fair this week.\n\n\"Inspiring young people is so important to her and she's been able to tie her Vice-Presidency of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust into a really impactful program with One Young World, a charity that has been dear to her heart for more than five years.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Markle was attending the One Young World Summit in London, where she was greeted by founder Kate Robertson on stage at Royal Albert Hall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6037/5ce9cd42a5ab4bedbc7ade33b81232c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
