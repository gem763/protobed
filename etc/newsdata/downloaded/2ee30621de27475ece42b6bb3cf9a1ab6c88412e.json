Today the biggest police operation in modern Russian history is taking place.\u201d\n\nPolice appeared to be targeting people who were part of Navalny's 2018 presidential election campaign. Though Navalny was barred from running, his supporters in local election headquarters in dozens of Russian cities have grown in number and in force, investigating high-level corruption and mobilizing supporters for opposition rallies.\n\nMany of Navalny's allies ran in local elections last Sunday and monitored the voting, documenting what they said were widespread violations.\n\n\"We're obviously talking about an attempt to hamper the operations of our regional network,\" Navalny supporter Leonid Volkov told The Associated Press.\n\nVolkov said he expected the police to confiscate equipment and described the raids as a \"robbery attempt,\" estimating the damage at $15,000.\n\nDespite the vast time differences across the country, authorities turned up at all of Navalny's chapters at 6 a.m. Moscow time, which points to a coordinated effort, Volkov said.\n\nPUTIN AGAIN THREATENS TO DEVELOP PREVIOUSLY BANNED MISSILES IF US DOES\n\nElection monitoring group Golos reported that homes of three of its regional coordinators had been raided. It said in a statement that the three people were training election monitors before the Sunday vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGolos condemned the police actions as \"an attempt of pressure and intimidation of public monitors.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Russian authorities raided homes and offices belonging to\u00a0supporters of Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 43 cities Thursday \u2013 a move Navalny described as the \u201cbiggest police operation in modern Russian history.\u201d", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
