Lawyers stressed that the deal involved only the two counties and was not a \"global resolution\" to the nationwide litigation.\n\nDetails of a deal involving McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Israel-based drug maker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. were to be announced later in the day. Cuyahoga County lawyer Hunter Shkolnik says the settlement amounts to $260 million.\n\nDistributor Henry Schein announced it had settled for $1.25 million, leaving only Walgreens in the case. A possible trial involving the drugstore chain was put on hold.\n\n\"The proposed settlement will make significant progress to abate the epidemic by providing resources for and applying funds directly to necessary opioid-recovery programs,\" lawyers representing local governments nationwide in the opioid cases said in a statement.\n\nFederal Judge Dan Polster had encouraged a settlement, which would provide affected communities the funds to combat opioid addiction much sooner than the lengthy process of going through a trial and the appeals that could follow.\n\nAttempts at a broader settlement broke down last week. An offer of $48 billion in cash, treatment drugs and services was rejected as lawyers for the the cities and counties involved clashed with states attorneys general over the distribution of the settlement.\n\n\"This is an important step that allows us to move forward to finalize the global settlement framework,\" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said of the Ohio deal.\n\nOxyContin maker Purdue Pharma reached a tentative settlement last month worth up to $12 billion. On Sunday, a committee guiding Purdue Pharma\u2019s bankruptcy had suggested drugmakers, distributors and pharmacy chains such as Walgreens use Purdue\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings to settle lawsuits. However, Paul Hanly, a lead lawyer for local governments in the lawsuits, had called that mass settlement idea \u201cmost unlikely.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio case had been slated to be the first federal trial related to an opioid crisis that has claimed an estimated 400,000 American lives over two decades. Cuyahoga and Summit counties sued drug manufacturer Teva, the distributors and the drug store chain Walgreens claiming their practices contributed to the devastating opioid epidemic.\n\nAll have routinely denied wrongdoing, saying the drugs had survived intense Food and Drug Administration scrutiny and carry warning labels explaining the risk of addiction.\n\nContributing: Jorge L.
