(Klein formerly ran Bloomberg\u2019s new initiatives; Cham was formerly a principal with Trinity Ventures.)\n\nWe talked with Bahat briefly last night about the new vehicle to ask how its capital will be deployed. Bahat stressed that the idea is to continue on the firm\u2019s current path, which is to write checks of between $500,000 to $1 million initially; to loosely target ownership of around 10% in the startups it backs; and to fund companies that are focused on the future of work, which has long been an area of interest for Bahat and his colleagues.\n\nThat can mean an instant messaging platform like Slack, in which Bloomberg Beta had and continues to have a small stake, following its direct offering. It also can mean backing a company like Flexport, a San Francisco-based freight forwarding and customs brokerage company that appears to be among Bloomberg Beta\u2019s biggest bets. (According to Crunchbase, the outfit has backed Flexport \u2014 valued most recently at $3.2 billion \u2014 at its seed, Series A and Series B rounds.)\n\nOthers of Bloomberg Beta\u2019s portfolio companies include the augmented writing platform Textio; the insurance broker Newfront Insurance; the continuous delivery platform LaunchDarkly; and Netlify, a cloud computing company that sells hosting and serverless backend services for static websites.\n\nWhat it won\u2019t back: financial tech startups. Given where its money comes from, it\u2019s \u201ctoo close to home,\u201d says Bahat.\n\nIn late August, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that Bahat would be part of his Future of Work Commission, which will be \u201ctasked with making recommendations to help California leaders think through how to create inclusive, long-term economic growth and ensure workers and their families share in that success.\u201d\n\nAs part of his role on that commission, and as an investor in some companies that cater to independent contractors, we asked Bahat what he makes of AB 5, the new California law for contract workers that aims to address inequality in the workplace but has been met with resistance from numerous industries and players. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash are even preparing to file a ballot initiative to exempt themselves from the law.\n\nBahat suggested he\u2019s not sure what to think quite yet, either. \u201cHow workers get classified is one of the issues\u201d the commission will be studying, he said.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t figured out how to make it all work; this story is still unfolding.\u201d", "description": "Bloomberg Beta, a San Francisco-based outfit that uses Bloomberg LP\u2019s money to make bets on startups, has closed its third fund with $75 million, according to Roy Bahat, who\u2019d previously run the online media company IGN and who operates the fund as an equal partnership with Karin Klein and James Cham.
