But, he said, \u201cI would welcome them with open arms to help us with a situation like this.\u201d\n\nRansomware \u2014 generally perpetrated by foreign hackers \u2014 has become a costly headache for governments, businesses and ordinary people around the world, infecting and locking up their computers until victims pay up with Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Baltimore and Lincoln County each refused to pay ransoms but expect to spend big money to recover from the mayhem \u2014 $18.2 million and as much as $400,000, respectively.\n\nMembers of Congress have introduced only four pieces of legislation since January that even mention the word ransomware. None would begin to address the full scope of the attacks that experts say will become only more numerous and severe.\n\nMeanwhile, the executive branch agencies in charge of cybersecurity are still working out the basic rules of the road.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m under ransomware attack, who am I supposed to call? Is that the same level as a disaster like a hurricane?\" Jeanette Manfra, a top DHS cybersecurity official, told reporters after a hearing. \"That\u2019s the part we\u2019re working on.\u201d\n\nMorning Cybersecurity A daily briefing on politics and cybersecurity \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

What is the digital equivalent of that?\u201d\n\nDHS has taken some steps to recognize the need for more coordination, releasing a recent advice document to help local and state governments struck by ransomware schemes. The FBI has issued its own general guidance about ransomware, although most of it was aimed at companies rather than governments.\n\nThe department is also making efforts to help repel ransomware attacks on voter registration databases managed by local election administrators, fearing that hostile nations could use criminal hacker techniques to undermine the 2020 election.\n\nBut that will do little to offset the cost of the digital attacks nationally or improve cyber defenses in smaller municipalities. Those include nearly two dozen local governments in Texas, which were struck over the summer by a coordinated attack that led Gov. Greg Abbott to activate the state\u2019s second-highest level of emergency response.\n\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called on Congress during a House Homeland Security panel in June to help cities and states by providing money to help them head off and respond to the attacks. Her city spent more than $7 million to recover from a ransomware attack last year .\n\nFederal funding, she said, \u201cwould not only accelerate responsiveness and restoration but would also result in fewer municipalities paying ransoms and ultimately decrease the occurrence of local governments as targets.\u201d\n\nBaltimore, meanwhile, is still recovering from what may prove to be the most expensive ransomware attack ever for a state or local government in the United States.\n\nThe assault began May 7, and as late as the first week of June, city officials said just a third of Baltimore's employees had regained access to their computers. The lockout delayed more than 1,000 home sales, knocked down a website for paying water bills, derailed city voicemail and email systems, took down a parking fines database and prompted cancellation of City Council hearings. In September, city auditors revealed that the attack had destroyed data in the information technology department.\n\nThe FBI received nearly 1,500 ransomware reports last year from all sectors, with an estimated damage total of $3.6 million. The cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, which has kept track of publicly reported ransomware attacks, tracked 80 on municipalities this year, compared with 53 in 2018, though both figures are likely to be underreported. And when it comes to paying the ransom to hackers, the cyber firm Coveware found that governments on average pay 10 times more than businesses.\n\nFormer national security officials acknowledge that Washington can do more.\n\n\u201cThis is ripe for additional focus,\u201d said John Dermody, a former DHS and National Security Council legal adviser who worked in the Obama and Trump administrations. \u201cIt\u2019s underappreciated for how significant it's going to be.\n\n\u201cThe attacks are fairly simple to pull off,\u201d he said, and state and local governments aren\u2019t fully equipped to fight ransomware.\n\nAnother complicating factor: Federal agencies don\u2019t always have the same agenda as the localities under attack. \u201cThe FBI wants to investigate and prosecute,\u201d said Dermody, now with the O\u2019Melveny law firm. \u201cThe private sector and state and locals may want to get back on line as fast as possible\u201d by simply paying the ransom, he said.\n\nThe FBI should help potential targets focus on preventing attacks , said John McClurg, vice president and ambassador at large at BlackBerry Cylance. Additionally, he said, \u201cThe federal government should consider procuring next-gen technologies and providing them to the state and local governments that lack either the expertise or the funding to do the evaluations and make the purchases.\u201d\n\nSome in Congress want more action. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a New Hampshire Democrat who frequently asks ransomware questions at hearings of the Homeland Security Committee, said the executive branch could deepen its relationships with state and local governments and remind them about the severe nature of the threat.\n\n\u201cIt's really important that we recognize these ransomware attacks are really a growing threat to all levels of government and all sectors, too,\" Hassan said.\n\nThe federal government could also lead more ransomware-specific exercises designed to prepare states and localities, said Courtney Modecki, vice president at firm SafeGuard Cyber.\n\nStates also need more immediate information about threats, said Charles Carmakal, strategic services chief technology officer for FireEye, a cyber firm that has helped respond to ransomware attacks.\n\nWithout help from Washington, state and local governments are acting on their own. At least five states \u2014 California, Connecticut, Michigan, Texas and Wyoming \u2014 have passed laws to explicitly criminalize ransomware and computer extortion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nThe United States Conference of Mayors this summer passed a resolution discouraging local governments from paying ransoms, saying it encourages more attacks when the hackers continue to profit. This summer, a variety of organizations \u2014 the National Governors Association, the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, the National Association of State Chief Information Officers and DHS\u2019 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency \u2014 also teamed up to produce ransomware advice.\n\nSome states have taken steps that, while not specifically designed to respond to ransomware attacks, have been used to do so, said Maggie Brunner, a program director at the National Governors Association\u2019s Center for Best Practices.\n\nBrunner pointed to Michigan establishing a Cyber Civilian Corps whose volunteers provide expertise to the state, while the governors of Colorado and Louisiana mobilized resources by declaring a state of emergency over cyberattacks.\n\nDespite the lack of ransomware-specific legislation, several bills introduced this year could help, experts said. Hassan touted one of her own bills she sponsored with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), S. 2318, that would require DHS to offer to state and local governments the same capabilities that the department uses to protect federal computer networks. Democrats at the House Homeland Security Committee are writing a ransomware-specific bill that could debut soon.\n\nThis week, the Senate also passed a version of a bill Hassan co-sponsored, H.R. 1158, that would enshrine into law the DHS cyber incident response teams that assist states and localities responding to cyberattacks.\n\nFor now, local officials aren\u2019t waiting for assistance from Washington, nor do all of them want financial help.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s absolutely a role for the federal government to play in terms of technical assistant, but I don\u2019t like the idea of payments,\u201d said Richard Permenter, Republican vice chairman of the Board of Commissioners in Lincoln County, N.C., where ransomware hit the sheriff\u2019s office in July. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t like to have to incur the financial burden from recovering from this, but we could.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cIf the NSA wants to send their best hackers down here to sit with the head of IT for week, we\u2019ll even buy them lunch.\u201d\n\nMichael B.
