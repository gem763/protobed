A treasure trove of biodiversity, it is threatened by deforestation mainly due to agriculture, livestock and mining activities and is currently in the grip of intense wildfires.\n\nSanctuary of biodiversity\n\nThe Amazon basin (7.4 million km\u00b2) occupies nearly 40% of South America's landmass and is spread over nine countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and Guyana (France).\n\nAbout 60% of its surface is in Brazil.\n\nThe forest, of which 2.1 million km\u00b2 are protected areas, is home to an unparalleled biodiversity: a quarter of the world's species are present there including some 30,000 species of plants, 2,500 of fish, 1,500 of birds, 500 of mammals, 550 of reptiles and 2.5 million insects, according to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO).\n\nSince 1999, more than 2,200 species of plants or animals have been discovered there.\n\n'Lung of the planet'\n\nThe Amazon contains one-third of the world's primary forests and, thanks to the eponymous river and its tributaries, 20% of the unfrozen freshwater.\n\nIt is the world's most important river in terms of output. It is also the longest, measuring 6900 km.\n\nFurthermore, it absorbs more CO2 than it rejects and stores 90 to 140 billion metric tonnes of CO2, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which warned that \"the release of even a portion of which would accelerate global warming significantly\".\n\nDeforestation and fires decrease the forest's capacity to absorb CO2.\n\nIsolated tribes\n\nThe region has been inhabited for at least 11,000 years, and now counts 34 million people \u2014 two-thirds of whom are city dwellers.\n\nBut nearly three million Indians from 420 tribes also live there according to ACTO. About sixty of these tribes \u2014 who speak 86 languages and 650 dialects \u2014 live in total isolation.\n\nThe largest is the 40,000-member Tikuna tribe which resides across Brazil, Peru and Colombia, according to the NGO Survival International.\n\nThe Brazilian Indian chief of the Kayapo tribe, Raoni Metuktire, is one of the most prominent figureheads in the fight against deforestation in the rainforest. He has been roaming the world since 1989 to draw attention to the deforestation and the plight of the Amazon's indigenous peoples.\n\nManaus: 'Capital of the Amazon'\n\nThe region is also home to the country's third-biggest industrial hub, Manaus, which has a population of 1.8 million.\n\nFounded by the Portuguese in 1669 on the banks of the Rio Negro, near its confluence with the Amazon, it grew rapidly towards the end of the 19th century thanks to the rubber trade before declining significantly.\n\nSince the creation of a free economic zone in 1967, the city primarily relies on its industrial sector which imports spare parts and exports finished products, particularly electronic equipment.\n\nMassive deforestation\n\nNearly 20% of the Amazon rainforest has disappeared in 50 years, according to WWF. And the phenomenon is accelerating.\n\nIn Brazil \u2014 led since January by climate-denier Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 deforestation in July was almost four times higher than during the same month last year, according to the DETER real-time detection of deforestation system used by the National Institute for Space Research.\n\nThis public body charged with measuring deforestation in the Amazon reported that 2,254 km\u00b2 of forests were destroyed in Brazil last month, compared to 596.6 km\u00b2 in July 2018 \u2014 an increase of 278%.\n\nThe main causes of deforestation are agriculture (soybean), livestock farming, the construction of hydroelectric dams and road infrastructures, the mining industry \u2014 the region is rich in gold, copper, tantalum, iron ore, nickel and manganese \u2014, forest fires and timber trafficking.\n\nFire is also one of the main tools used for deforestation and clearing \u2014 by which vegetation, together with their roots, are permanently removed \u2014 including by farmers.\n\nIn turn, deforestation \"contributes directly to a change in rainfall patterns in the affected region, extending the length of the dry season\", according to Greenpeace. This makes wildfires potentially even more dangerous.", "description": "The Amazon absorbs more CO2 than it rejects and stores 90 to 140 billion metric tonnes of CO2, according to the WWF, which warned that \"the release of even a portion of which would accelerate global warming significantly.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/10/39/90/1000x563_cmsv2_348fe180-2b1c-5edc-a78b-e4471462d7bd-4103990.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-23"}
