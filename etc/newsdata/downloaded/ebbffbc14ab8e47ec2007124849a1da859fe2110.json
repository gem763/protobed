She\u2019s galloped the horse this morning and was cock-a-hoop and very pleased and then learned post galloping the horse that she wasn\u2019t there to ride the horse on Saturday.\u201d\n\nThought Of That has been entered in both the Derby and the Mackinnon Stakes (2000m) on November 9, with connections leaving their racing options open.\n\nThe connections of Thought of That need to buy a full length mirror and have a good hard look at themselves \ud83e\udd2c imagine sacking Linda Meech after she rides it a treat last start. If ever there was a perfect combo it\u2019s her & that horse \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f absolute rubbish decision \ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c \u2014 Nick Cahill (@nickcahill9) October 28, 2019\n\nTarcoola has enjoyed watching the rise of Thought Of That through the ranks with his brilliant recent wins. We have also admired the great riding of him by Linda Meech who understands his assets very well. We are now very disappointed that she will not be riding him next time. \u2014 Tarcoolastud (@Tarcoolastud) October 29, 2019\n\nLinda Meech gives Thought of that a great ride in the Caulfield stakes and then gets dumped off for the Zahra in the derby. But why... #pleaseexplain #vicderby \u2014 Kyal Thompson (@King_Kyal16) October 29, 2019\n\nThe decision to replace Linda Meech on Thought Of That is completely baffling. I just don't get it. #horseracing \u2014 Stephen Rodgers (@Steve_Rodgers) October 28, 2019\n\nLinda Meech proves you don't have to be dead to be stiff. Rode Though Of That beautifully last two starts, yet replaced by Mark Zahra for Saturday's VRC Derby. \u2014 Daniel Miles (@danielmiles) October 29, 2019\n\nThought Of That has rocketed in to $4 for the Derby with the TAB, after opening at $51, following a maiden win at Donald and then victory in the Group 3 Norman Robinson Stakes (2000m) at Caulfield.\n\nMORE NEWS:\n\nThe Mark Newnham-trained Shadow Hero was an easing $3 TAB favourite for Saturday\u2019s Derby after drawing barrier 10 this morning.\n\nThought Of That remained $4 second elected after drawing barrier one with Soul Patch ($6) and Warning ($9) the only other horses in single figures.\n\nGeelong Classic winner Long Jack eased to $15 after receiving barrier 16.", "description": "Jockey Linda Meech has been replaced on Thought Of That which is a $4 second favourite for Saturday\u2019s $1 million Victoria Derby despite piloting the colt to victories at his past two starts.", "authors": ["Russell Gould"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/39a132b98ca05e78004f0d544703de33?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
