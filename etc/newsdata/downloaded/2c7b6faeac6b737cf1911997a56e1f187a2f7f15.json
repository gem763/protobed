The victim was coming from work and found her husband asleep. She woke him up because he was supposed to go to work the night shift.\n\n\"He started accusing her of cheating and assaulted her with his fists. The victim managed to run to the police station and opened a case. Police accompanied her to her residential place where they found her husband.\"\n\nThe man is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court soon.\n\nMbele appealed to women to open cases of domestic violence and urged them not to withdraw the cases.\n\n\"If your partner assaults you once, he won\u2019t stop it until he kills you. The best way once he assaults you [is to] report him and let the law take its course.\n\nNo man has a right to assault a woman, said Mbele.\n\n", "description": "Gauteng police have issued safety tips to women after a husband was arrested for allegedly assaulting his wife on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4068/980de783e6a54770a6bddd9e8633ef80.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-10"}
