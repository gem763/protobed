He is a man who will bear this mark forever, he is a man, who other than this blemish, was a shining example to the profession.'\n\nMr Williamson told the hearing Person A's story changed after she underwent therapy.\n\nHe paraphrased the original position of Person A which said: 'We both f****d up, you are my married boss, what a cliche.'\n\nPerson A claimed a 'very respected' female senior lawyer at the firm told her not to speak about the incident, adding: 'I felt very on my own and those feeling of self blame and self hatred just got worse.'\n\nBeckwith told the panel that he was shocked to hear about the allegation and claimed the woman had made 'untruthful and malicious' claims after accusing him of blocking her for promotion, which he said was 'ridiculous.'\n\nHe told the hearing: 'I'm beyond upset about what this has all done to my wife.'\n\nOutside court his solicitor, Nick Brett said: 'Mr Beckwith is disappointed with the finding of the tribunal.\n\n'He is presently taking advice on the outcome and it would not be appropriate for him to comment further at this stage.'\n\nBeckwith was a senior lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (pictured), one of the City's so called 'Magic Circle' of law firms\n\nBeckwith and the woman who complained about him went to her home after a night in this pub\n\nAndrew Katzen, Head of Regulatory Law at Hickman & Rose Solicitors, said the case marked a 'turning point in the way professional regulatory bodies tackle the increasingly blurred boundary between private and working lives.'\n\nHe added: 'The allegations against Mr Beckwith were extremely serious. But they are allegations that, only a few years ago, would likely have been rejected by the Solicitors Regulation Authority as being outside their remit.\n\n'Changing social attitudes to sexual behaviour embodied by the 'Me Too' movement mean that this is no longer the case.\n\n'This is the first in a line of tribunal hearings in which male partners of City and US law firms are accused of rape, sexual harassment and attempted resultant cover-ups.'\n\nSenior Freshfield's Partner Edward Braham said after the hearing: 'Ryan Beckwith has been on indefinite leave from the firm for some time and has now resigned as a partner with immediate effect.'\n\nA full written judgement detailing the reasons behind the finding and sanction is likely to be published in around seven weeks. Beckwith would have 21 days from the date of that publication to lodge an appeal.", "description": "Ryan Beckwith today sensationally resigned from one the City's 'Magic Circle' of law firms after a disciplinary panel ruled he should not have engaged with the 'exceptionally drunk' woman.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/16/19547850-0-image-a-17_1570722986521.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
