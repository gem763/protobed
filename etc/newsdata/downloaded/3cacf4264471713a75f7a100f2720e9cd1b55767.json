It is perhaps a singular dynamic\u2014a private entity comfortable in the knowledge that the leader of the free world needs its favor more than it needs his. Much of this stems from the network\u2019s peerlessness in the world of right-wing programming. Fox speaks directly to Trump\u2019s base, a core constituency that the president must keep intact if he is to win reelection. And while other outlets may be somewhat more reliably pro-Trump, such as the cable channels One America News Network and Newsmax, none comes close to matching Fox\u2019s massive reach\u2026\n\nThe person who\u2019s spoken with Scott recently told us that if the CEO is sensitive about anything, it\u2019s the criticisms of the network as propaganda\u2014not Trump\u2019s complaints. Scott started at Fox as a production assistant at the network\u2019s inception in 1996, led the launch of Greta Van Susteren\u2019s primetime show On the Record in 2002, and went on to become network executive producer and executive vice president of programming. Before becoming the network\u2019s first female CEO, she oversaw some of Fox\u2019s most popular opinion shows, including Fox & Friends, The Five, and Hannity. But what limited public profile she had was largely negative: After Ailes was publicly accused of sexual harassment and abuse at the company in 2016, she was alleged to have helped cover up the misbehavior. She and Fox have since moved to dismiss the suit, and she has claimed that she had \u201cno clue on what was going on\u201d in Ailes\u2019s office\u2026\n\nAt this point, the president is likely the one with more to lose. As Trumpworld sees it, Fox is an essential corrective to a cable-news ecosystem that masquerades as objective while plotting to sink his presidency. He needs Fox to counter the media criticism coming his way, and if the network wobbles, it\u2019s trouble. Trump barely won in 2016, and any defections inside his base could potentially doom his prospects.\n\nUpdate: Fox emails to note that Scott started there in 1996, working as an executive assistant to the head of programming, not as a production assistant.", "description": "", "authors": ["Plott", "Theatlantic.Com Politics Archive Fox-News-Isnt-Worried-About-Trumps-Tweets"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
