(plant, lettuce, tomato) burger will go on sale in 28 McDonald's locations in Southwestern Ontario, including Canada's largest city, Toronto, for a limited time. The 12-week test will begin Monday.\n\nBeyond Meat's BYND stock shot up 20% in premarket trading. Some food industry insiders had speculated that McDonald's could partner with Nestle to bring a vegan burger to market in North America. Nestle made McDonald's vegan burger , the Big Vegan TS, in Germany, one of McDonald's top 5 international markets.\n\nMcDonald's MCD said it is testing the P.L.T. because of customers' growing interest in plant-based alternatives. The company said it's still in \"learning mode,\" so it will review the test's results before adding the Beyond Meat burger elsewhere.\n\nThe P.L.T. with Beyond Meat will be available for a limited time in select restaurants in Canada, beginning September 30, 2019.\n\nThe plant-based protein trend is growing rapidly as people try to eat less meat and to reduce their environmental footprints. Unlike veggie burgers, which long had a mediocre reputation, the new plant-based proteins are designed to look and taste like meat and appeal to meat eaters as well as vegans and vegetarians.", "description": "McDonald's will begin testing a Beyond Meat burger, giving the plant-based meat craze a major endorsement.", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190926065456-01-mcdonalds-beyond-meat-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
