Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY\n\n\"There's no one here who will talk to you. Now go away,\" a sullen-faced guard shouted at the entrance to Burisma's small office in Vodiane, 300 miles southeast of Kyiv, last week.\n\n\"Hunter Biden? Never heard of him,\" said Ludmila Rynovaya, 72, a resident of Vodiane's nearby village \u2013 population 600 \u2013 who was chatting with a friend in a small grocery store. \"We're pretty good at corruption,\" she said. \"We don't need Americans to help us.\"\n\nOver the course of about a week in Ukraine, the message from two dozen government officials and anti-corruption investigators quickly became clear: The allegations against the Bidens are entirely lacking in evidence.\n\nBut they persist, and not only because Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, keep repeating them.\n\nWhat is true and what is false is exceptionally hard to pin down in this fledgling democracy, one riddled with regulatory loopholes, poor governance and never-ending budget shortages.\n\nUkraine is a place of great economic promise, with extensive natural resources and a highly educated, tech-savvy workforce.\n\nTweet This Vladimir Grigorishin, a Kyiv resident and customs \"broker\" It's not really corruption, but more a way of saying, 'Thank you.'\n\nBut abuses of power and cronyism are rampant, reaching from the highest levels of government to everyday tasks like acquiring a driver's license or paying a doctor's bill, according to more than two dozen Ukrainians interviewed for this story.\n\n\"It's not really corruption, but more a way of saying, 'Thank you,' \" said Vladimir Grigorishin, 49, a Kyiv resident and customs \"broker\" who stopped in the city's picturesque Kontraktova Square on his way to work to describe what he does for a living.\n\nHe mediates fees between tax officials and private business owners who rely on foreign-made products. The process involves informally negotiating payments to officials.\n\nOutside Ukraine, this is known as bribery. For Grigorishin, it's business.\n\n'The whole thing is manufactured'\n\nPerhaps one of the most incongruous aspects of Trump's allegations is that he seems to believe that Ukraine, one of the poorest countries in Europe, which has been fighting a costly war with Russian-backed separatists for the past five years 1, is conspiring with Democratic rivals in order to force him from office.\n\nThere is a problem with this theory: There are few, if any, trustworthy voices in Ukraine to back it up. Nor is there any credible evidence. Even Trump's staff have repeatedly warned him that the claims are baseless.\n\nHow Trump's Ukraine allegations spurred an impeachment inquiry Show Hide Democratic lawmakers launched an impeachment inquiry against Trump in September after a whistleblower claimed Trump had appeared to try to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Trump's Democratic rivals in return for military aid. Soliciting foreign election help is illegal. In an account of the call released by the White House, Trump asked Zelensky for a \"favor\" and urged him to \"look into\" Biden and his son. Trump has accused the Bidens of acting improperly in Ukraine, either through political interference aimed at assisting Hunter Biden's commercial activities or an even darker web of deceit related in some unexplained way to U.S. election meddling. Since then, the scandal has widened to Giuliani's emissary activities on behalf of Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence, U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Kurt Volker, the U.S. State Department's special envoy for Ukraine, has resigned over the affair. A second whistleblower also has emerged. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and he has ordered White House officials not to comply with the impeachment inquiry. And he has publicly repeated, on Twitter and in remarks to the press, the message he delivered in private to Zelensky: Ukraine should investigate the Bidens. Hide\n\nThat hasn't prevented Trump from spreading false information, just as he once promoted the so-called \"birther\" conspiracy theory \u2013 the debunked claim that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States.\n\n\"Rudy Giuliani's only interest in Ukraine was to push the idea of an investigation into Biden and then push that idea with the American media, to hype it, and to attack Biden's son ahead of the U.S. election\" next year, said Sergii Leshchenko, a former lawmaker who worked under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nTweet This Sergii Leshchenko, a former lawmaker who worked under former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Rudy Giuliani's only interest in Ukraine was to push the idea of an investigation into Biden and then push that idea with the American media, to hype it, and to attack Biden's son ahead of the U.S. election.\n\nLeshchenko has met Giuliani. He also helped spearhead anti-corruption efforts under Poroshenko, who lost reelection this spring to Volodymyr Zelensky, a TV actor turned politician.\n\n\"The whole thing is manufactured for Trump's political advantage,\" said Leshchenko, a former investigative journalist.\n\nAllegations like this are not uncommon in Ukraine. Since gaining independence 2 from the Soviet Union in 1991, the country has struggled to confront corruption and misinformation, said Olexiy Haran, a political scientist at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Pro-Russian supporters carry a huge Russian flag during a rally in Kharkiv, eastern Ukraine, some 40 km from the Russian frontier, on March 16, 2014....

He views such activity, officially illicit, as essential to surviving in the faction-ridden country.\n\nThere are more egregious examples. Some involve people an arm's length from Trump.\n\nYuriy Lutsenko is one of the former Ukrainian prosecutors who, according to a whistleblower's complaint 3, peddled a series of baseless claims against the Bidens and the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and about alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nA Ukraine primer Show Hide \u2022 Ukraine, home to about 45 million people, declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. \u2022 Ukrainian is the official language; many residents also speak Russian, which is similar. \u2022 Use of the term \u201cthe Ukraine\u201d is considered insulting because it suggests Ukraine is a region, not a country, hearkening back to when it was part of the Soviet Union. \u2022 It was once known as the breadbasket of Europe because of its large agriculture industry. The collectivism ordered by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin exploited this and caused a famine between 1932-1933, known as the Holodomor. It\u2019s estimated to have killed about 7.5 million people. \u2022 Despite Ukraine\u2019s independence, Russian President Vladimir Putin believes its cultural and linguistic ties to Russia mean it should be part of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. \"You have to understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a country,\" Putin told President George W. Bush during a NATO summit in 2008. \u2022 In 2014, Russian special forces occupied Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, a strategic territory that provides access to the Black Sea. Russia later held a vote in Crimea in which residents opted to become part of Russia. Ukraine maintains the vote was neither free nor fair. The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia in response. \u2022 Ukraine has been fighting a war, also since 2014, with Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that has claimed at least 13,000 lives and displaced 1.5 million people.

Anatoly Sokolov for USA TODAY\n\nYanukovych abused his office in other ways. Today, his sumptuous estate outside Kyiv, called Mezhyhirya Residence, has been preserved as a kind of museum of corruption.\n\nThe estate is a national park, but its ownership is murky. An attendant accepted admission fees only in cash and wouldn't issue a receipt.\n\nVisitors can marvel at its former zoo, a pier for luxury yachts, a helicopter pad, a tennis court, horse stables, a rare-breed dog kennel, a boxing ring, a fleet of vintage cars, a spa and a shooting range.\n\nEvidence, Ukrainians say, that Yanukovych ran Ukraine like a mafia boss.\n\nThe main house is decorated with paintings of his favorite ballerinas and elaborate mosaics of historical and religious scenes. Yanukovych built a private church at Mezhyhirya.\n\n\"Here, you can stand and look over your empire like a real czar,\" a visitor remarked last week as he surveyed the view of the Dnieper River from the balcony of one of the master bedrooms. The entire estate is furnished in a manner that calls to mind the decadent court of France's King Louis XIV. Even the planters are encased in expensive snakeskin.\n\n\"I supported the ostriches. What's wrong with that?\" Yanukovych said about his petting zoo in an interview with the BBC in 2015, a year after he fled to Russia.\n\nIn the interview, Yanukovych seemed incredulous that someone would question whether it was appropriate to spend $100,000 on chandeliers in a country where in 2018, the average monthly salary was about $350.\n\nA view inside the church former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych built at his former residence outside Kyiv, on Oct. 4, 2019.

They invited Westerners and other high-profile figures to sit on their boards.\n\nA former president of Poland joined Burisma's board at the same time as Hunter Biden in 2014, according to the company.

Because nobody is treating it.\"\n\nHazy allegations float from Ukraine to the U.S.\n\nTrump has more than one conspiracy theory about Ukraine. They have two things in common: Their origins are murky and they lack evidence.\n\nTrump and Giuliani, who was known as \"America's mayor\" for his leadership after 9/11, have pushed unsubstantiated allegations that Joe Biden sought to help his son by persuading the Ukrainian government to dismiss a general prosecutor named Viktor Shokin.\n\nIn 2014, Shokin began investigating Burisma for money laundering and tax irregularities.\n\nHunter Biden joined Burisma's board that same year. He promised assistance with corporate governance and transparency and was reportedly paid about $50,000 a month.\n\nThe core allegation from Trump and Giuliani is that Joe Biden intervened to have Shokin fired in order to halt a criminal investigation into Burisma. To help his son's business interests, essentially.\n\nBut no one who spoke with USA TODAY said those allegations have any merit, and no credible evidence has emerged to support them \u2013 though several experts in the region said it seems clear Hunter Biden got the job because of his last name. Joe Biden has said his son did nothing wrong. \"He's a fine man. He's been through hell,\" he said last week.\n\nTrump has also suggested that a hacked 5 Democratic National Committee server and 33,000 emails from Hillary Clinton's tenure running the U.S. State Department \"could be\" in Ukraine. That's a debunked conspiracy theory, one piece of an overarching conspiracy theory in which Ukraine, not Russia, meddled in the 2016 election.\n\n\"I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike,\" Trump said in a July phone call with Zelensky. \"I guess you have one of your wealthy people ... The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on.\"\n\nCrowdstrike, a digital security firm, is not a Ukrainian company.

Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY\n\nUkraine has long insisted it stayed neutral in the 2016 election. A 2017 Politico investigation did conclude that several Ukrainian government officials may have tried to help Clinton's presidential campaign by publicly questioning Trump's fitness for office, but ultimately it found \"little evidence of ... a top-down effort by Ukraine.\"\n\nIn fact, much of what these Ukrainians discussed related to Manafort.\n\nNo one disputes that Joe Biden wanted Shokin, the prosecutor, fired.\n\nHelp support quality journalism like this. Subscribe!\n\nSo did many European countries and international organizations. Not only did they believe Shokin undermined attempts to end Ukraine's culture of graft, but his own staff accused him of being corrupt.\n\n\"The pressure to remove Shokin did not just come from Biden,\" said Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's minister of foreign affairs in Poroshenko's administration. \"The pressure also came from the European Union and others. I know. I was in the meetings about this.\"\n\nHunter Biden had just joined the board around the time Ukrainian prosecutors opened their probe into Burisma in 2014. He wasn't the subject of the investigation, according to Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau, an independent government agency that has worked closely with the FBI.\n\nInvestigators suspected Zlochevsky, Burisma's owner, of various financial crimes, including not paying taxes. The case was settled out of court in 2017.\n\nUkraine's new general prosecutor, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, during a press conference in Kyiv on Oct. 4, 2019. Anatoly Sokolov for USA TODAY\n\nBut the allegations against Biden seemed to gain traction last week when Ruslan Ryaboshapka, Ukraine's newly appointed general prosecutor, announced his office would review the Burisma probe as part of an audit of cases that had been closed, settled or dismissed by his predecessors.\n\nRyaboshapka told USA TODAY the decision to review the Burisma case was not connected to the period Hunter Biden spent on the firm's board.\n\nTrump's information, he said, is \"not coming from me.\"\n\n'They are either lying to you or ... trying to confuse you'\n\nSo who is it coming from?\n\nOne source is Shokin, the prosecutor whom Biden has boasted of forcing out.\n\nGiuliani has appeared on cable TV news shows in the U.S. waving an affidavit in which Shokin claims he was fired in 2016 because he was leading a \"wide-ranging corruption investigation\" into Burisma.\n\nVitali Kasko, the deputy to Ryaboshapka, has a simple response: \"Shokin is not a reliable figure.\"\n\nRudy Giuliani, an attorney for President Donald Trump, speaks in Washington on May 5, 2018. Andrew Harnik, AP\n\nKasko once worked for Shokin but resigned, citing the total \"lawlessness\" of his boss. It's yet another thread that ties these officials together like the Ukrainian embroidery for sale near tourist attractions in Kyiv.\n\nHis characterization is supported by the whistleblower's complaint, Ukraine's anti-corruption investigators, international diplomats and even several Republican U.S. senators, who in 2016 urged Poroshenko to \"press ahead with urgent\" reforms and remove Shokin.\n\nPoroshenko, who made millions running a chocolate and candy empire before getting into politics, told reporters in Kyiv last week that Joe Biden never applied any inappropriate pressure or asked him to close or open any cases when he was Ukraine's leader.\n\nShokin did not to respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nBesides Shokin, Giuliani enlisted the help of Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas, two Florida-based associates with family and business connections to Ukraine. They worked to dig up dirt on the Bidens and Clinton, according to their own admission.\n\nFruman and Parnas were arrested Wednesday on campaign-finance charges, accused of funneling \"foreign money\" for political candidates and campaigns. The charges don't appear to relate to the work they were doing on behalf of Giuliani. The two men have also been subpoenaed by House Democrats investigating the president.\n\nShow caption Hide caption These images provided by the Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office show booking mugshots of Igor Fruman (left) and Lev Parnas, associates of Rudy Giuliani who were arrested...

Meanwhile, they promoted a plan to sell U.S. liquefied natural gas to Ukraine to replace Russian imports disrupted by the war, according to a detailed profile of Fruman and Parnas by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that Fruman and Parnas also attempted to help install new management at the top of Naftogaz, Ukraine's huge state-owned gas company. The plan only hit a snag, according to the AP, when Poroshenko lost the election to Zelensky.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who in Ukraine tells you what \u2013 a lawyer, a politician, media, someone in business. They are either lying to you or at the very least trying to confuse you,\" said Oleksandr Techynskyi, a Ukrainian filmmaker whose 2014 documentary \"All Things Ablaze\" chronicles the violent revolution that led to Yanukovych's ouster.\n\nTechynskyi said Trump's allegations resemble what Ukrainians have been dealing with for years, and what Americans may have to get used to: official misinformation.\n\n'These prosecutors are politicians'\n\nLutsenko, who succeeded Shokin as Ukraine's general prosecutor, has turned out to be another unreliable narrator, according to several Ukrainian officials.\n\nHe's another one of Giuliani's sources.\n\nIn March, Lutsenko started making false claims in opinion articles written by John Solomon, a conservative commentator for The Hill, a U.S. political news website, according to the whistleblower's complaint and anti-corruption investigators.\n\nLutsenko's claims should sound familiar.\n\nAmong them: that Joe Biden pressured Poroshenko to fire Shokin in order to quash a criminal probe into Burisma. That Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador, obstructed Ukrainian authorities' pursuit of corruption cases and even gave him a \"do not prosecute\" list.\n\nNo credible evidence has emerged to back up either allegation.\n\nThe Ukraine office of Transparency International, a Berlin-based corruption monitoring group, said it valued Yovanovitch's help fighting corruption.\n\nBut Trump unceremoniously pulled her out of Ukraine in May; House Democrats are currently investigating why. Giuliani has since acknowledged that he told Trump that Yovanovitch should be fired.\n\nTweet This Aubrey Belford, editor for the OCCRP in Ukraine The best way to think about this is that these prosecutors are politicians. They are not necessarily like people working for the Justice Department in the U.S. \u2013 except for maybe William Barr.\n\n\"The best way to think about this is that these prosecutors are politicians,\" said Aubrey Belford, an editor for the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project in Ukraine. \"They are not necessarily like people working for the Justice Department in the U.S. \u2013 except for maybe William Barr.\"\n\nHe was referring to Barr's probe into the origins of the Russia investigation, which he initiated at Trump's request.\n\nThe Justice Department did not return a request for comment.\n\nLutsenko was fired in August. Before he left his position, according to the whistleblower's complaint, he implied his office was receptive to the idea of reopening the investigation into Burisma. It would have been in keeping with Trump's wishes.\n\nSince then, Lutsenko has said in interviews he knows of no evidence linking the Bidens to wrongdoing. Now he, too, is under investigation, for protecting illegal casinos in Ukraine. He denies it.\n\nIt's easy to see why some Ukrainians have become numb to the allegations and counter-allegations that follow every changeover in power.\n\nThe latest came Wednesday, when Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach announced he has evidence that Burisma paid Joe Biden himself for lobbying. Derkach claimed his source for this information was a journalist; he didn't name him. The Kyiv Post, an English-language newspaper, called Derkach \"dubious.\"\n\nHours later, Giuliani appeared on Sean Hannity's show on Fox News and parroted Derkach's claim.\n\nTwo countries led by TV stars\n\nLike Trump, Ukraine's President Zelensky has spent time in the world of entertainment \u2013 and like his American counterpart, he has parlayed this into a political career.\n\nZelensky was an actor before he assumed Ukraine's highest office. He starred in a hit TV sitcom about an idealistic teacher who is accidentally propelled to the presidency after his students film him railing against corruption. In the show, called \"Servant of the People,\" the video goes viral and a political star is born.\n\nThe real-life version is not that different.\n\nZelensky ran on an anti-corruption platform and named his political party \"Servant of the People.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Sept. 25, 2019.

Kolomoisky is the owner of the TV network that aired \"Servant of the People.\"\n\nAnastasiya Kozlovtseva, of Transparency International's Ukraine office, said Zelensky's decision to appoint Ryaboshapka as general prosecutor is an encouraging sign because he is an experienced and credible anti-corruption campaigner.\n\n\"But we're waiting to see how Zelensky deals with his ties to Kolomoisky,\" she said.\n\nTrump's scandal is not Zelensky's biggest problem.\n\nChernobyl disaster: More than thirty years later, five million people still live on heavily contaminated lands and hundreds of thousands of people are sick or suffering. Read\n\nThe country is fighting a war with Russia that has claimed 13,000 lives, displaced 1.5 million people and led to Ukraine ceding parts of its territory to the region's superpower.\n\nUkraine relies on U.S. money and moral goodwill to keep Russia at bay. One of the potential threats of the impeachment inquiry is that Trump will harbor a grudge against Ukraine, with regional consequences.\n\n\"There's a danger we could sign a weak peace deal with Russia that would bring us closer to Putin's orbit,\" said Haran, the political scientist. At the time of Yanukovych's ouster in 2014, many Ukrainians were hoping for closer ties with the European Union, with all the legal and economic benefits \u2013 and oversight \u2013 that would bring.\n\nAnd then there is the matter of Zelensky delivering on his campaign promise to end Ukraine's culture of corruption.\n\nMany politicians have been elected on similar promises, only to be replaced by others who promise it, too. Meanwhile, activists and reformers are themselves regularly threatened and accused of wrongdoing.\n\n\"We wanted to drain the swamp here in our country,\" Zelensky told Trump in their July call. \"We brought in many new people. Not the typical politicians, because we want to have a new type. A new type of government.
