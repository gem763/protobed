Here\u2019s how.", "language": "en", "text": "1. The \u201ctop\u201d candidates talk the most about security policy.\n\nThe Democratic candidates have increasingly discussed foreign policy not just on the debate stage, but also on the campaign trail.\n\nAD\n\nOne way to track this is by checking how often security has been mentioned in the top candidates\u2019 social media accounts, defining top candidates as those polling above 2 percent support nationally as of the first debate in late June. I collected tweets using the Twitter API and WorkbenchData to pick up references to well-defined foreign affairs, leaving off trade and immigration so as to focus on security-related issues such as Afghanistan, cyberwarfare, U.S.-Iran relations and North Korea.\n\nAD\n\nThe three top-tier candidates \u2014 using The Washington Post\u2019s most recent ranking of front-runner Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) \u2014 have been commenting comparatively often on security issues. Since the June debate, security was the topic of 15.2 percent of Biden\u2019s tweets and 14.5 percent of Warren\u2019s. That\u2019s a significantly larger proportion than those from some of the candidates still working to establish themselves as viable, such as former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro with 9.3 percent and Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) with 9.1 percent.\n\nSubstantively, these messages often focused on the security implications of climate change, driven in part by CNN\u2019s September climate town hall. But they also discussed the future of the Afghanistan mission, veterans\u2019 issues, and U.S.-Russia relations.\n\nAD\n\n2. Republicans\u2019 advantage on national security has faded.\n\nAD\n\nBy talking about national security, the top Democratic candidates are working to craft images as potential commanders in chief. That\u2019s more likely to succeed than in years past. Republicans no longer have the monopoly on appearing strong on national security, as traditional party \u201cstereotypes\u201d keep weakening.\n\nIn 2014, Gallup found that Americans were 23 percentage points more likely to say Republicans would do better than Democrats at protecting the country from international threats; by 2018, the gap had shrunk to only 6 points. This is compounded by the fact that public approval vs. disapproval for the president\u2019s handling of foreign policy has seen a negative 10-percentage-point swing since summer 2018.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring last week\u2019s debate, the candidates took advantage of that growing gap between the Trump administration\u2019s actions and general American opinion, charting a middle course between respecting the public\u2019s skepticism about intervention abroad while remaining largely opposed to stepping back from key commitments.\n\nThe field\u2019s two military veterans \u2014 Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) \u2014 clashed on the future of U.S. involvement in Syria. But most of the candidates rejected Gabbard\u2019s vision for wholesale departure in favor of Buttigieg\u2019s call for measured engagement. Even Warren, the party\u2019s front-runner and advocate for a decreased presence in the region, remarked that the Islamic State could not be allowed purchase and that withdrawal would have to be done \u201cthe right way, the smart way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, nearly all the candidates talked about combating Russian political interference in U.S. elections. Biden aimed for the security \u201cmiddle\u201d by arguing most fervently in favor of renewing support to NATO allies. And Sanders argued for continued mitigation measures on climate change through support for policies like the Green New Deal. While Warren didn\u2019t mention it in the debate, her platform specifically identifies the military as a venue for implementing climate action, calling for limiting military dependence on fossil fuels, hardening facilities against extreme weather and investing billions into research on \u201cmicrogrids and advanced energy storage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n3. The Syria withdrawal works to the Democratic candidates\u2019 advantage\n\nAD\n\nBoth Booker and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke noted the national security community\u2019s disapproval, specifically mentioning retired general and Trump\u2019s former defense secretary Jim Mattis. Invoking Mattis\u2019s past remarks that the United States had two powers in foreign affairs \u2014 \u201cintimidation and inspiration\u201d \u2014 Booker called for relying on the diplomatic corps to \u201cfocus on the latter power.\u201d And Biden similarly drew on the ex-military community\u2019s disapproval for the decision when he explicitly noted that \u201ccommanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed\u201d of the withdrawal.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Democratic field tightens in coming months, we can expect an even larger shake-up in how the candidates and parties position themselves on national security.\n\nAD\n\nMichael A.
