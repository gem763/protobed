We started to dig and we loved the architecture the team had built and the cultural fit.\"\n\nStarted in January 2016, co-founder and chief executive Michael Watts said Cloud Conformity had received acquisition offers from its early days, even when it was pre-revenue.\n\nMr Watts decided to accept Trend Micro's offer because he said he was confident the multinational would help it execute on its vision more quickly.\n\n\"We're already growing quickly at 1000 per cent-plus last year and and we tripled our revenue again in the last two quarters. Hitting $100 million in revenue was on our secondary horizon within five years and now we think we can cut that in half,\" he said.\n\n\"Consolidation in the sector will continue. We're a relatively small company and it's frustrating that for companies to solve one challenge like private cloud they've had to go to a large number of vendors. Now, Trend Micro can service more needs of its customers.\"\n\nGlobally, Trend Micro has more than 500,000 customers and it is still led by Taiwanese founder Eva Chen. In 2018, it generated $2.2 billion in revenue (\u00a5160.4 billion) and the company is valued at $10 billion.\n\nThe company is not very acquisitive, having purchased just eight companies in the last decade.\n\n\"The stats are that about nine out of 10 deals fail. It's one reason why many of our peers are doing serial acquisitions to play catch-up to us,\" Mr Simzer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We just don't acquire many companies and the ones we do acquire, we spend a lot of time finding the right ones.\"\n\nMr Watts and Cloud Conformity's 50 staff will stay on with the business and continue to be based in Sydney. Trend Micro has also employed the company's former contractors and is converting them to full-time employees.\n\nTrend Micro's hybrid cloud security solutions business has been its fastest-growing division for the last five years and now makes up a quarter of the overall business.\n\nDespite cloud computing being an industry trend for many years, Mr Simzer said it continued to be one of the most disruptive forces in the IT industry.\n\n\"We tend to look for where infrastructure changes are going on. It's those changes that create opportunities for the bad guys to get in,\" he said.\n\n\"One of the biggest changes is the moving of workloads to infrastructure-as-a-service and we see that continuing and we're making an even bigger investment in this area.\"", "description": "Trend Micro has bought Cloud Conformity for $70 million only three years after the company launched.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9498%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1041%2C$y_280/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8b737015c23f2940a5d136ff4aef43c1a411f69f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
