He Was Quietly Shown The Door At His Venture Firm Earlier This Year.", "language": "en", "text": "Andy Rubin, the former Google senior vice president whose $90 million exit package caused a worldwide employee walkout at the search giant last year, quietly left Playground Global, the venture firm he founded, in May according to documents viewed by BuzzFeed News.\n\nThe revelation comes as Rubin, who was accused of coercing a subordinate into sexual acts while at Google before being given a hero\u2019s send-off in 2014, attempts to make a public comeback with Essential Products, the mobile device company he founded. On Tuesday, Rubin tweeted images of Essential\u2019s new phones, some of his first public statements since late 2018 when news broke on the circumstances surrounding his exit from Google.\n\nThose circumstances caused an uproar at Google, which was already dealing with several stories of executive harassment and misbehavior, and provided direct proof that Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent company Alphabet, and his board members had intentionally tried to cover up misdeeds at the top. Not only were Google executives aware of allegations of sexual misconduct at the time of Rubin\u2019s exit, but they failed to notify employees, lauded him in a departure announcement, and sent him off with a $90 million exit package.\n\nRubin's departure from Playground was also accompanied by a payout, with a source familiar placing the amount at more than $9 million. Documents related to his exit, which were seen by some investors and the company\u2019s leadership, but not all of Playground\u2019s staff, were reviewed by BuzzFeed News.\n\n\u201cEffective May 31, 2019, Playground Global ended our business relationship with Andy Rubin,\u201d read one internal document. \u201cWhile Andy is still a good friend of Playground, he no longer has any economic interest in or any ongoing roles at Playground Global or the related funds.\u201d\n\nThe exact reasons for Rubin\u2019s exit from Playground are unknown, though he remains on the company\u2019s site with the title of \u201cFounding Partner.\u201d Rubin did not respond to an email request for comment. A spokesperson for Playground acknowledged receipt of BuzzFeed News\u2019 specific questions Rubin\u2019s departure but did not respond in time for publication.\n\nRubin\u2019s quiet, money-padded exit from Playground and his public reemergence at Essential is yet another example of a male technology executive with sexual misconduct allegations coming back into an industry leadership role and reaping the associated rewards. Recently, executives from companies including SoFi, Uber, and Google returned to positions of power at different tech companies following credible allegations and investigations into sexual misconduct, as some employers and investors have decided to look beyond past indiscretions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the culture of technology and venture capitalists has changed enough that we should be comfortable bringing back people who have had bad behavior back into the mix,\u201d said former venture capitalist Ellen Pao, who now leads up the diversity initiative Project Include. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any accountability to prevent it from happening again.\u201d\n\nIn showcasing Essential\u2019s new phone on Tuesday, Rubin \u2014 who has made few statements since the news broke about his alleged misconduct and exit package at Google \u2014 seemed to be signaling his public return to his hardware startup. In late 2017, he took a leave of absence from Essential after the Information reported about \u201can inappropriate relationship\u201d with an employee at Google. That was followed by an October 2018 New York Times story in which Rubin was said to have coerced a subordinate to perform oral sex on him in 2013, leading to a complaint with the company\u2019s human resources department.\n\nInstead of firing him, however, Page and Google\u2019s board protected Rubin, the inventor of the Android operating system, announcing that he was leaving to focus on investing and startups, while awarding him a $90 million exit package that has since become the subject of a shareholder lawsuit. In response to the news, thousands of Alphabet employees from Tokyo to London to Mountain View, California, walked out in protest last November.\n\nThat outrage spurred some change. Google CEO Sundar Pichai would go on to announce that the company had previously terminated 48 people for sexual harassment, including 13 who were senior managers or above. None received an exit package, he said.", "description": "Android creator Andy Rubin left Google with a $90 million exit package after investigations into sexual misconduct.
