It didn\u2019t feel that way by half-time with the hosts leading 5-1, but Kosovo came out not only fighting but reorganised, and gave England an actual scare. Valon Berisha was the stand-out, bagging a well-taken double, but forward Vedat Muriqi provided strength and awareness (not to mention the whipped left foot pass that split England\u2019s defence for Berisha\u2019s second) while Swansea\u2019s Bersant Celina added guile. Perhaps the pivotal contribution, however, came from coach Bernard Challandes. His switch to 4-4-2 put England\u2019s creaky centre-backs under more pressure than they had endured in the opening period, and it made the difference to a second half in which Kosovo lived up to their billing.

The two teams have developed a frenetic rivalry in recent years, sharing four red cards in the previous four meetings. Lionel Messi\u2019s red card against Chile in July\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica third-place play-off spared him from Friday\u2019s encounter, where the reckless and dangerous challenges resumed from both sides. Argentina were particularly on the receiving end, with Juventus\u2019s Paolo Dybala, Inter\u2019s Lautaro Mart\u00ednez and Tottenham\u2019s Giovani Lo Celso all caught above the ankle with studs \u2013 the latter also sustaining a hip injury that will keep him sidelined for the next six weeks. For Spurs and other clubs, this fixture \u2013 played in front of a sparse crowd in Los Angeles \u2013 must have seemed wholly unnecessary and ill-thought out, with perhaps Alexis S\u00e1nchez completing 90 minutes the only positive.

Michael O\u2019Neill and Joachim L\u00f6w can take a certain satisfaction, in their own different ways. Northern Ireland have long been noted as being a primarily physical threat, especially at home. However, as O\u2019Neill stresses, they now have an extra dimension, in terms of athleticism and confidence on the ball, as illustrated by George Saville and Jamal Lewis. In goal too, Bailey Peacock Farrell looked impressive, as Germany fashioned chances as well as goals from Marcel Halstenberg and Serge Gnabry. L\u00f6w was pleased with the result if not altogether the performance. His instincts to stick with new players, such as Halstenberg, was vindicated.

Six wins out of six, and six points clear at the top, meaning they are potentially only one more win away from qualification for Euro 2020. While progress is being made, this week\u2019s narrow away wins only came after two shocking refereeing decisions. With the score at 1-1, Armenia\u2019s Aleksandr Karapetyan was sent off for an elbow that never was, while Finland \u2013 also drawing 1-1 with 10 minutes left \u2013 were extremely unlucky to be penalised by the Scottish referee Bobby Madden for a handball inside the box. Roberto Mancini deserves some praise, but optimism must be tempered: only Bosnia and Herzegovina from Group J are ranked inside Fifa\u2019s top 50. Italy are still a long way off being considered anything other than dark horses for next year\u2019s tournament.

Giggs was appointed Wales manager in January last year and has used 43 players across 15 matches. His argument would be that injuries and a lack of match fitness have contributed heavily. Whether he has a case or not, with two critical qualifiers coming up, Giggs badly needs to get his team selection and formation right. Friday\u2019s unconvincing 2-1 win over Azerbaijan strengthened the calls for another midfielder to be included at the expense of a makeshift striker/false nine. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s possible return from injury could solve that problem. A 4-3-3 formation featuring Gareth Bale through the middle, with Dan James and Harry Wilson either side, would give Wales a threat on the counterattack and more control in the centre of the pitch.

On a Sunday evening in October, just days after facing Russia in Moscow, the team ranked 211th and bottom of the Fifa rankings come to town. As things stand, only San Marino keep Scotland from the foot of Group I. The Scottish FA\u2019s desire to buy Hampden from Queen\u2019s Park always looked questionable. When far from full, the stadium lacks any form of atmosphere. Scotland has alternative grounds to fit the requirements of the national side and showpiece domestic matches. When asked how Hampden could be transformed into an imposing venue the Scottish FA\u2019s chief executive offered the hopeful solution of winning matches. With the opposite scenario continuing to play out, a soulless, sparse backdrop to San Marino\u2019s visit will do nobody any favours.

Having been eliminated in the group stages without scoring a goal, the Swallows were dumped out of World Cup qualifying by neighbours Tanzania after failing to convert a single penalty in the shootout after two 1-1 draws. Berahino was one of the culprits, meaning he has not scored a penalty in his last five attempts \u2013 a run that stretches back to May 2015 against Chelsea for West Brom.

To take advantage of that unexpected boon, Mick McCarthy\u2019s men need to win in Tbilisi next month. Conor Hourihane scored the winner when the sides met in Dublin earlier in the campaign but this time the Aston Villa midfielder may be asked to play at left-back owing to Enda Stevens\u2019s suspension and fitness doubts over Matt Doherty. Hourihane did a reasonable job in that unfamiliar role in Tuesday\u2019s win over Bulgaria, while Josh Cullen or Jack Bryne both made good cases for replacing him (and/or Glenn Whelan) in midfield, depending on how bold McCarthy wants to be. Paul Doyle\n\n\u2022 Match report: Republic of Ireland 3-1 Bulgaria\n\n10) Silva still waiting for worthy praise\n\nIt seems ridiculous that after scoring four goals for Portugal against Lithuania, this talking point would be about anything other than Cristiano Ronaldo. But while Ronaldo finishes the moves, it is Bernardo Silva who continues to be the beating heart of this team, instrumental in Portugal\u2019s impressive 4-2 win over Serbia on Saturday with a goal and an assist, while laying on two more goals for Ronaldo in the 5-1 win in Vilnius. Silva has had a remarkable year, winning the player of the tournament award in a victorious Nations League campaign, as well as a domestic treble with Manchester City, and there was bemusement when he wasn\u2019t nominated as one of 10 players for Fifa\u2019s The Best award. The 26-year-old has long lost his \u201cunder-rated\u201d tag, but still doesn\u2019t seem to be widely regarded for what he is: one of the best players in the world.
