But the stinging condemnation of Turkey\u2019s incursion into northern Syria this week has provoked Erdogan\u2019s harshest reaction in years.\n\n\u201cThose who turn a blind eye to all the developments in Syria and make a habit of only criticizing Turkey -- we invite them to reason, conscience and morality,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey sees the Kurdish militia as a threat to its security due to its links to separatist Kurds battling the Turkish military. It wants to drive the group from a border zone and then resettle at least 1 million displaced Syrians on the strip of territory.\n\nBut European officials and others have denounced the offensive for opening another front in Syria\u2019s conflict and potentially fracturing international efforts to defeat Islamic State. Thousands of Kurdish fighters died taking a lead role in dismantling the jihadist caliphate.\n\nMigration to Europe has dropped off dramatically since more than a million asylum seekers entered the bloc four years ago, above all to Germany. But not before the influx redrew the EU\u2019s political map, driving a wedge between member states and fueling a rise in far-right populism that exploited social anxiety in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nThere has been a recent swell of asylum seekers crossing the western Aegean Sea, a sign of trouble in the arrangements hashed out with Turkey that eventually staunched the flow of arrivals during the crisis of 2015 and 2016.\n\nA new influx, even if nowhere near the same scale, has the potential to stir up trouble for European leaders such as Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, who suffered from the populist backlash against her open-door policy.\n\n--With assistance from Taylan Bilgic.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Onur Ant in Istanbul at oant@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alaa Shahine at asalha@bloomberg.net, Mark Williams, Onur Ant\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to send millions of Syrian refugees settled in Turkey to Europe, as he bridled at criticism of his military offensive against Kurdish fighters.\u201cIf you try to define our operation as an invasion, then our job becomes easy,\u201d Erdogan said on Thursday", "authors": ["Onur Ant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yVtCCUTtw3ZEl.VmZQNPGw--~B/aD0zMjc7dz01OTM7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/16eb4460-eadd-11e9-bddf-37590d49d385", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
