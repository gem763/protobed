According to MLB Stats, his nine strikeouts made him the second Yankees lefty to record multiple starts of 8+ strikeouts in the same postseason campaign, two decades after David Wells did so for the 1998 championship-winning club.\n\nPaxton\u2019s strong outing was backed by a handful of runs from DJ LeMahieu and Aaron Hicks, both of whom went deep against Astros ace Justin Verlander in the bottom of the first inning. LeMahieu\u2019s leadoff solo shot marked his first postseason home run since Game 1 of the ALDS, while Hicks\u2019 three-run 347-footer was his first home run of any variety since July 24 (and his first in the playoffs since the 2017 ALDS).\n\nNeither team managed a single run after the first inning, leaving the two pitching staffs to duke it out for eight quick innings. Verlander outlasted Paxton \u2014 taking the game through the seventh with five hits, four runs, and nine strikeouts \u2014 but even with a flawless contribution from Brad Peacock in the eighth, there was little the hurlers could do to help the Astros solve Paxton and an airtight Yankees bullpen.\n\nWith the win, the Yankees will try to push the series to a full seven games in order to snatch the AL pennant from the Astros. They\u2019ll have to do in Houston, however, as the Astros will regain home field advantage when Game 6 kicks off on Saturday at 8:08 PM EDT. Neither starter has been announced yet; per Houston skipper A.J. Hinch, it will likely be a bullpen day.", "description": "On the brink of postseason elimination, the Yankees pulled off a decisive Game 5 victory over the Astros on Friday night.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nbchardballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gettyimages-1181965395-e1571452090690.jpg?w=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
