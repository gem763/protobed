The FDA said because data is limited on the effects of inhaling Vitamin E, it is advised to avoid THC vaping products that may contain it.\n\nAdditionally, the FDA said many of the patients who reported lung illnesses said they used a THC vaping product before falling ill. At least seven deaths linked to lung-related illnesses have been reported nationwide. As the investigation continues, President Trump moved to temporarily halt the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a ban.\n\nCDC ACTIVATES EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO AID VAPING CRISIS INVESTIGATIONS\n\nBut Todd disagrees with the ban and instead called for more thorough quality control.\n\n\u201cIn California, they test for pesticides, they test for heavy metals\u2026 the tests they\u2019re doing in terms of quality control are more rigorous than those for the wine that people drink,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the most important thing that people can do is go into their legal dispensaries and actually ask for the test results to see what you\u2019re smoking.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe compared the products to cigarettes, and said that while \u201ceveryone knows cigarettes can kill you, yet, they don\u2019t ban them.\u201d\n\nHe instead said that lawmakers should push for more transparency on what people are smoking to let them know what the effects of the products are.", "description": "Health officials have urged consumers to stay away from THC-containing products amid an investigation in hundreds of vaping-related illnesses.", "authors": ["Emily Deciccio"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/17/694940094001_6087183430001_6087189581001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
