Officials insisted the idea of charging grieving families thousands of pounds is \u2018dead and buried\u2019 [File photo]\n\nThe law had already been changed meaning that if no action had been taken the fees increase would have been expected to come into force next year.\n\nIt would have raised the Ministry of Justice an extra \u00a3185million a year from the charges by 2022/23.\n\nInstead ministers have ordered a wider review of court fees. Last night Mr Buckland praised the Mail\u2019s campaign and said he had \u2018listened very carefully\u2019 to our readers\u2019 views.\n\n\u2018The Daily Mail has done some excellent work on this issue,\u2019 he said. \u2018I have listened very carefully to the strong views aired on proposed new probate fees.\n\n\u2018While fees are necessary to properly fund our world-leading courts system, they must be fair and proportionate. We will withdraw these proposals, and keep the current system while we take a closer look at these court fees as part of our annual wider review.\u2019\n\nThe probate fee increase would have come into force at the same time that ministers are cutting inheritance tax. From April, the threshold at which inheritance tax is imposed will increase to \u00a31million for couples wanting to pass on their main family home [File photo]\n\nThe review of court fees, which will start within weeks and report in months, will only involve \u2018small adjustments\u2019 to cover costs.\n\nOfficials insisted the idea of charging grieving families thousands of pounds is \u2018dead and buried\u2019.\n\nA government source said: \u2018Robert was hugely impressed with the Mail\u2019s campaign, and resolved as soon as he became Justice Secretary 11 weeks ago to kill this proposal.\n\n\u2018These fees are reviewed annually, but only small adjustments to cover costs are on the cards. Any plan to charge people thousands of pounds is, quite simply, dead and buried.\u2019\n\nThe current probate fees are \u00a3215 for individuals and \u00a3155 if applying through a solicitor. But changes to the law were announced last November to introduce a sliding scale of fees linked to the value of the estate.\n\nIt would have meant administrative fees ranging from \u00a3250 to \u00a36,000. At the time ministers defended the move, arguing that only very large estates would pay the highest fees.\n\nBut critics said it was a stealth tax which would hit people when they were dealing with the death of a loved one.\n\nThe fear was that families would be forced to take out loans to pay for the cost of probate fees and access their inheritance.\n\nThe measure was quietly pushed through by a committee of MPs on a knife-edge vote. Critics said it was wrong to use fee-raising powers, which are designed to cover the cost of processing paperwork, as a way to raise money.\n\nThe Law Society said the increase was an \u2018unfair way to squeeze money out of vulnerable families\u2019.\n\nProbate must be granted before families can release any money from an estate \u2013 for example by selling a house.\n\nThe probate fee increase would have come into force at the same time that ministers are cutting inheritance tax. From April, the threshold at which inheritance tax is imposed will increase to \u00a31million for couples wanting to pass on their main family home.\n\nLabour has proposed a \u00a39billion increase in inheritance tax, alongside increases in capital gains tax.\n\nA Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \u2018Fees are necessary to properly fund our world-leading courts system, but we have listened carefully to concerns around changes to those charged for probate and will look at them again as part of a wider review to make sure all fees are fair and proportionate.\u2019", "description": "The Justice Secretary abolished the controversial planned increase in probate fees introduced by Theresa May.
