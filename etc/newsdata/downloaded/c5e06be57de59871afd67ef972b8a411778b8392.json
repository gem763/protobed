UNLV likely anticipated a similar breeze when it hosted Howard in Week 1 two years ago. Instead, the Bison pulled off a historic, 43-40 upset that garnered national attention and helped freshman quarterback Caylin Newtown emerge from his older brother\u2019s shadow.\n\nAs if losing to a 45-point underdog wasn\u2019t humiliation enough, UNLV also cut a $600,000 check for Howard\u2019s troubles. Maryland only had to pay the Bison $350,000 to make the 25-minute trip from D.C.\n\nBoth of those \u201cguarantee\u201d games amount to peanuts in college football\u2019s grand scheme.\n\nUSA Today in a recently published rundown of appearance fees for more than 250 games involving at least one Football Bowl Subdivision school this season, reports that $150 million will change hands.\n\nSome of those games involve one FBS school against another, ostensibly fair matchups like Oregon-Auburn ($3.5 million apiece from the promoter) and California at Mississippi ($450,000 to the visitors). But others are pure \u201cpayday\u201d games, in which FBS schools invite Football Championship Subdivision foes to campus for an expected drubbing.\n\nNo other Week 1 tilt was as spectacularly lopsided as Maryland-Howard, but some honorable mentions are in order.\n\nTexas A&M beat Texas State, 41-7, with the losers collecting $1.3 million. Florida A&M outperformed its contract, pocketing a mere $370,000 for a 62-0 stomping at Central Florida. For peak revenue while maintaining respectability, the winner was Kent State, which took home a cool $1.5 million for a 30-7 loss at Arizona State.\n\nThis year\u2019s Backfire Award goes to 25-point favorite Tennessee. The Volunteers paid Georgia State $950,000 and suffered a 38-30 loss in front of 86,000 stunned fans.\n\nSuch upsets are the dream for FCS teams. But their administrators seek dollars, not Ws, when scheduling guarantee games against Power 5 schools. That money goes a long way for athletic departments that otherwise struggle to cover expenses. It also produces a trickle-down effect, allowing fiscally strapped institutions to use their limited resources in other areas.\n\n\u201cI do not see a time when we will not play these games,\u201d Charles McClelland, commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic Conference, told The Athletic last week.\n\nThe benefits of being a punching bag can be seen throughout an athletic department, from uniforms and equipment to facilities and travel. Costs are a little harder to calculate, but they range from morale to physical injury for overmatched players.\n\nDifferences in size, speed and strength are dangerous \u2014 and impossible to ignore \u2014 when Power 5 schools line up against lower-level opponents for four quarters. Even when matches don\u2019t result in catastrophic injury \u2014 like the fractured vertebrae Southern University\u2019s Devon Gales suffered against Georgia in 2015 \u2014 they can leave the weaker team compromised in upcoming games.\n\nIt\u2019s also fair to reconsider what FBS schools gain by punching below their weight.\n\nYes, they receive revenue from a home gate and an almost certain step toward bowl eligibility.\n\nBut does whipping Howard help Maryland compete against Ohio State and Michigan?\n\nIf being a factor in your league is the ultimate goal, facing high-quality nonconference foes might be a better approach.\n\nDuke didn\u2019t offer much resistance Saturday against Alabama, losing 42-3. But at least both schools play in the FBS. I understand that the Crimson Tide needs to fill its schedule and seeks injury-free gimmes toward the end of the Southeastern Conference grind. However, coach Nick Saban should find more Duke-like, FBS patsies, instead of paying Western Carolina $525,000 for a Nov. 12 visit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Let\u2019s play all Power 5 games,\u201d Saban told ESPN last month. \u201cI was in the NFL where we played all the games against NFL teams. But let\u2019s play at least 10 Power 5 games. That would be better for the players, better for the fans, and I think you wouldn\u2019t have to worry that if you lost a game that you wouldn\u2019t have as much of a chance to still be in [the College Football Playoff]. They talk about strength of schedule now, but how do you really evaluate that?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know.\n\nUnder the current system, it might be margin of victory divided by size of payout.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
