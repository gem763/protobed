(Eduardo Lima/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nGeneral Motors Co. halted manufacturing work at its Oshawa Assembly Plant on Friday as the strike by workers in the United States disrupts the tightly-integrated automotive industry.\n\nJacqueline Thomson, a spokesperson for GM, said approximately 2,000 unionized workers have been temporarily laid off with pay from the Oshawa facility as vehicle production was stopped Friday.\n\n\u201cWe have seen disruption of our vehicle assembly work at the Oshawa Assembly Plant due to the UAW strike,\u201d Thomson said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cWe plan to resume these operations as quickly as possible upon resolution of the UAW strike.\u201d\n\nGM had stopped production on its truck line earlier this week, laying off about 1,300 employees because of a parts shortage caused by the strike. On Friday it also stopped production on its flex line, which produces the Chevrolet Impala and Cadillac XTS.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a question of not having enough parts to build the vehicles,\u201d Unifor president Jerry Dias said in an interview on Thursday.\n\nDias also said he expects that about 800 employees working at GM\u2019s St. Catharines Propulsion Plant will receive temporary layoff notices as early as Monday if the strike in the United States continues.\n\nThomson said that the company\u2019s operations in St. Catharines, as well as at its CAMI facility in Ingersoll, have not been disrupted as of Friday.\n\nNearly 50,000 United Auto Workers members walked off the job on Monday, idling 55 factories and parts warehouses across the U.S. Negotiations between GM and the union resumed Thursday.\n\nThe strike, the first in more than a decade, could lead to thousands of job losses in the highly-integrated Canadian automotive industry.\n\nAutomotive parts manufacturers have also started scheduling contingency plans because of the closures in the United States.\n\nYahoo Finance Canada More\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.", "description": "General Motors Co. will shut down its Oshawa Assembly Plant on Friday as it faces a parts shortage caused by the prolonged strike by workers in the United States.", "authors": ["Alicja Siekierska"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/crLoHJaiLHp7nlY6_hwIGg--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-11/67c330e0-f1b5-11e8-9df7-afa8f379d245", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
