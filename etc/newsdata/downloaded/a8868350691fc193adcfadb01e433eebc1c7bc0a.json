The blockchain e-register will run on self-executing smart contracts, purportedly reducing time, costs and occurrence of errors in the registration process.\n\nThe initiative found favor with the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, which is testing the registration process with the system. If the system proves to be successful in Singapore, the ICC will bid for global adoption of IERS standards in the industry.\n\nSome rise, some fall\n\nThe market for blockchain-powered solutions has become highly demanded in the maritime sector. In late August, Thailand\u2019s Customs Department announced it would use IBM\u2019s Tradelens blockchain solution. The platform is expected to streamline operations by managing shipment tracking and information sharing in Thai ports.\n\nMaritime shipping firms Ocean Network Express and Hapag-Lloyd joined blockchain tracking platform TradeLens in July. The platform aims to cut paperwork, associated costs and time in the logistics industry \u2014 which reportedly accounted for $4 trillion at the time \u2014 with over 80% of the goods carried by the ocean shipping sector.\n\nHowever, some blockchain shipping initiatives fell short of initial aspirations, with blockchain shipping startup 300cubits suspending operations of its booking module and the circulation of its TEU token in October. Low transaction volume \u2014 with only a couple hundred containers using the system \u2014 made the operation unfruitful.", "description": "The Singapore Shipping Association, the International Chamber of Commerce and blockchain firm Perlin are jointly working on an e-registry for ships", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8xNjg2ZjFlMWUxMmRiMjQ4NzU0MDdhNTQ2N2ZmY2U2Zi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
