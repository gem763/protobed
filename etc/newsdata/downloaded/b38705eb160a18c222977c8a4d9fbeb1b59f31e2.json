I've already defended my title. This is my second defense. Of course, I don't have a lot of fights ahead, because I don't want to fight when I'm 40 years old. This isn't my plan. We'll see.\"\n\nNurmagomedov previously said that if he beats Poirier this weekend then he wants to fight Tony Ferguson, the well-rounded Californian on a 12-fight win streak, next, rather than rematch his Irish rival Conor McGregor.\n\nAnd though he doesn't want to compete late into his 30s, he did say he still has a \"fire\" burning within as he looks to build a legacy as one of the most dominant athletes in the sport.\n\n\"Before I make a decision, I have to talk with my father [Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov], I have to talk with coach Javier [Mendez], all my brothers, Dominance MMA [his management team], and all the people around me.\"\n\n\"Right now, I'm focused on competition because I have too much fire inside me.\"\n\nRead more:", "description": "Ahead of his UFC lightweight title bout against Dustin Poirier, the Russian said he doesn't want to still be fighting when he's 40.", "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5ca5002016c95838d13bfb17-1334-667.jpg"}
