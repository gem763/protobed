Schiff of California, said, \u201cThe idea that the Department of Justice would have intervened to prevent it from getting to Congress throws the leadership of the department into further ill repute.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has long said that the attorney general should shield him, the way he believed Robert F. Kennedy protected his brother President John F. Kennedy, and Eric H. Holder Jr. protected President Barack Obama. He has told White House aides that he wants an attorney general who would be his Roy Cohn, referring to his onetime personal lawyer and fixer who once did the bidding of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.\n\nThe rough transcript showed that Mr. Trump believes he has that man. In a single sentence during the call with Ukraine\u2019s leader, Mr. Trump said that he would have Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, and Mr. Barr reach out to help further an investigation of Mr. Biden and his younger son, Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian corporation.\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call, and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call, and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nA Justice Department official said that Mr. Barr had no knowledge of the call until the director of national intelligence and the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general sent the department the whistle-blower\u2019s criminal referral late last month, and that Mr. Trump has not spoken with the attorney general \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son.\u201d", "description": "The Justice Department took four weeks to dismiss the significance of a phone call that has, in days, created a furor that could consume the Trump presidency.", "authors": ["Katie Benner"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25dc-justice1/25dc-justice1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
