They may not celebrate Mass, but they may preach, teach in the name of the Church, baptize and conduct wedding, wake and funeral services and even run a parish with the permission of a bishop.\n\nIn his closing comments to the synod, Francis said: \u201cWe still have not grasped the significance of women in the Church.\u201d\n\nScholars have debated the precise role of women deacons in the early Church.\n\nSome say they ministered only to other women, such as at immersion rites at baptism and to inspect the bodies of women in cases where Christian men were accused of domestic violence and brought before Church tribunals.\n\nOthers believe women deacons in the early Church were fully ordained and on a par with the male deacons at the time. The Church did away with female deacons altogether in later centuries.\n\nA commission that handed its report to the pope this year was inconclusive. Francis, who ends the synod ceremoniously with a Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Sunday, gave no details on when the new commission would start its work.\n\nFrancis and his predecessors have ruled out allowing women to become priests.\n\nBut advocates of women priests see a female deaconate might eventually make it easier for a future pope to study the possibility of women priests.", "description": "If Pope Francis agrees with the bishops' recommendation, it could mean a landmark change in the Catholic Church\u2019s centuries-old discipline of celibacy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db55f0f2100005d31ad3fff.jpeg?cache=lyid7cv3pe&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
