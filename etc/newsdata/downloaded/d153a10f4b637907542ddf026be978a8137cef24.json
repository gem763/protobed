Posted by Matthew Keys on Tuesday, 22 October 2019\n\nLocal California CBS reporter Angel Cardenas has been fired after he carried out a live segment from a classic car show in which he put on an animated display of climbing on top of the privately-owned vehicles\n\nHe left viewers shocked when he scaled two of the display cars to pose on top of the bonnet in a jaw-dropping moment\n\n'I feel like a kid in a candy store without the owner because you can do anything,' he told the camera.\n\nHe then focused his attention on a pink Ford Thunderbird and opened the car door to hop inside but accidentally hit the car next to it.\n\n'Are you kidding?' one of the presenters asks. 'Leave your name and number on the dashboard.'\n\nAt the end of the segment, Cardenas approached the new Ford vehicles. Speaking to Ford employee Rachel, he says: 'Now there's a sign in front of that Ford that says \"Please keep off displays,\" can I just finish up this live shot posing on the hood for my friends Tina and Ashley?'\n\nHe focused his attention on a pink Ford Thunderbird and opened the car door to hop inside but accidentally hitting the car next to it\n\n'I may look the other way,' Rachel agrees.\n\nApproaching a new Ford Escape Hybrid, Cardenas says to the camera: 'Hey come out to the auto show today, it starts at what, ten or something? And it'll be open to what, four or five?'\n\n'Six o'clock,' Rachel can be heard saying in the background, but the reporter appears more enraptured by the car and launches himself onto the vehicle's bonnet before exclaiming: 'Oh! That didn't sound good.'\n\nOne of the on-air presenters exclaims: 'Oh my god! I would get off that now.'\n\nAt the end of the segment, Cardenas approached the new Ford vehicles. Speaking to Ford employee Rachel, he says: 'Now there's a sign in front of that Ford that says \"Please keep off displays,\" can I just finish up this live shot posing on the hood for my friends Tina and Ashley?'\n\nSomeone out of shot then motions for Cardenas to get off the car. Cardenas ends the cringe-inducing segment by saying: 'I'm going to get in trouble, back to you guys!'\n\nThe reporter was subsequently fired from CBS. The auto show's Facebook page later gave the message: 'After the Producer of the Sacramento International Auto Show reached out to the General Manager of KMAX TV regarding yesterday's astonishingly awful incident, she received a call this morning from the GM that the reporter from the Good Day Sacramento segment has been terminated immediately and the station expressed their sincerest apologies for the incident.'\n\nOne of the programme's viewers took to Facebook to post a clip of the incident, adding: 'I've never seen such a disregard for someone else's vehicle.'", "description": "Local California CBS reporter Angel Cardenas enraged viewers when he scaled display cars to pose on their bonnets during the Sacramento International Auto Show on Sunday.", "authors": ["Sophie Tanno For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/09/20073382-0-image-a-13_1571818259976.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
