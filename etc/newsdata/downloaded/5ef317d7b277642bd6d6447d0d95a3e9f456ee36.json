Shanahan, McVay and LaFleur worked together as fellow Redskins assistants on the coaching staff of Shanahan\u2019s father, Mike. The big victory for Kyle Shanahan and the Niners on Monday night came at the end of day on which the Redskins started over, firing Jay Gruden as their coach and naming offensive line coach Bill Callahan to replace him on an interim basis.\n\nAD\n\nBruce Allen defends Redskins tenure, says \u2018the culture is actually damn good\u2019\n\nIt is Year 3 of the rebuilding project for Shanahan and John Lynch, the general manager of the 49ers, in San Francisco. The Niners got off to a 0-9 start in 2017 in the duo\u2019s first season in the Bay Area. But Lynch traded for Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo and the 49ers finished strong, raising expectations for last season. Those hopes were dashed when Garoppolo suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in the third game of the 2018 season. The Niners, predictably, fell apart, and Shanahan and Lynch were left with a two-year record of 10-22.\n\nBut the 49ers stuck to their plan and now Garoppolo is back in the lineup and making Shanahan\u2019s offense work. He threw two touchdown passes Monday night against the Browns to complement a rushing attack that produced 275 yards. Matt Breida sprinted to an 83-yard touchdown on the Niners\u2019 first offensive play and they never looked back. They led by 14-0 in the first quarter, by 21-3 at halftime and by 28-3 early in the third quarter.\n\nAD\n\nThe 49ers are a complete team that began the day ranked fourth in the league in total offense and third in the NFL in total defense. A pass rush led by Nick Bosa harassed Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield throughout the game Monday. Mayfield threw two interceptions in an eight-for-22, 100-yard passing performance and was sacked four times. Bosa had two of the sacks and mocked Mayfield at the end of the first half by pretending to plant a flag in the turf. That was payback for their college days when Mayfield planted an Oklahoma flag on the field at Ohio State, Bosa\u2019s university.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI had to get him back for it,\u201d Bosa told ESPN after the game.\n\nThe Niners will have tougher matchups to come in a rugged NFC West in which they must square off with the Rams and Seattle Seahawks. But if there were any doubts about the 49ers\u2019 legitimacy as a potential contender, they were erased Monday.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Shanahan, McVay and LaFleur worked at Redskin Park, there was no way of knowing for certain just how good they\u2019d be as head coaches. With each coach, a case can be made that the Redskins didn\u2019t really make a mistake in allowing him to leave. That\u2019s just how it works in the NFL sometimes. Coaches move on. Their success elsewhere depends on the circumstances in which they find themselves. Shanahan has Garoppolo in San Francisco. LaFleur has Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. McVay has Jared Goff in L.A.\n\nAD\n\nRedskins fire Coach Jay Gruden after 0-5 start\n\nBut the totality of the coaching talent that has left the Redskins organization is striking. McVay turned the Rams from losers into Super Bowl participants within two seasons. LaFleur has hit the ground running in his first NFL head coaching job with the Packers. Shanahan seems to have turned things around in San Francisco. Meanwhile in Ashburn, team president Bruce Allen parried away reporters\u2019 pointed questions Monday about his role in the Redskins\u2019 woes.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, the past will inform the present and the future for the Redskins. Some within the league believe that they will take a long, hard look at Kevin O\u2019Connell, their 34-year-old offensive coordinator, to be Gruden\u2019s more permanent replacement. They should be wary, that line of thinking goes, of allowing another young and promising offensive coach to leave the building, and potentially thrive somewhere else.\n\nIf the Redskins needed another cautionary tale, all they had to do was watch Shanahan\u2019s 49ers play Monday night.\n\nRead more on the NFL:\n\nFalcons Coach Dan Quinn now has the NFL\u2019s hottest seat\n\nSteelers\u2019 Mason Rudolph just \u2018wasn\u2019t there\u2019 after being knocked out cold by scary hit\n\nBrewer: Another Redskins coach fired, and his successor already is destined to fail\n\nAD", "description": "Shanahan\u2019s 49ers are 4-0 after beating the Browns convincingly Monday night, and he and fellow former Redskins assistants Matt LaFleur and Sean McVay have a combined head coaching record this season of 11-3.", "authors": ["Mark Maske", "Sports Reporter Covering The Nfl"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xdpRQzC6kS3zGBjmOBMSglfN-YE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FRDVCSHJPAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
