Here the prime minister was criticised for not attending the climate summit, hassled about Australia\u2019s record and pressed by journalists about youth protests on leaders\u2019 inaction.\n\nThe differences could not have been more stark: another apotheosis for the alliance in Washington, yet more hectoring on the banks of the East River in New York. It\u2019s little wonder that the Prime Minister used last week\u2019s speech to vent his frustrations at lectures from an \u2018ill-defined borderless community\u2019.\n\nSuch criticism of the UN, however, is hardly new, and taps deep roots in the Liberal party\u2019s foreign policy outlook. Robert Menzies was prone to frown on the UN, since it challenged his concept of the British empire as a way of international life. Coming into office in 1949 as the decolonising impulse swept through Asia and Africa, Menzies was adamant that the British Commonwealth remained the best expression of Australia\u2019s identity abroad.\n\nLater, Menzies refused to back international condemnation of apartheid South Africa, partly because he didn\u2019t want a global spotlight shone on the \u2018White Australia\u2019 policy and Australia\u2019s treatment of its indigenous peoples; and partly since he believed that neither the UN nor the Commonwealth had any right poking its nose into a country\u2019s domestic politics. Lest it not be forgotten, too, that at the UN\u2019s creation in 1945, Labor\u2019s external affairs minister HV Evatt, often revered as a high priest of liberal internationalism, remained steadfast on the new body not having the right to interfere with Australia\u2019s immigration policy.\n\nScott Morrison's experience at the UN was very different from Washington. SMH\n\nMorrison\u2019s speech also showed he is not waiting for the US to once more take up its regional reins. Hence his emphasis on Australia\u2019s strengthening relations with Japan, India, Indonesia, South Korea, ASEAN and the Pacific; his stress on Canberra\u2019s pushing ahead with the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a clear sign that the government is keen for more economic integration with China.\n\nOn the other hand, his hailing of the recent ministerial meetings of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing together Australia, India, Japan and the US, sits somewhat uneasily with Morrison\u2019s eschewing of cold war style containment of Beijing. Notwithstanding this significant advance for the \u2018Quad\u2019, it remains to be seen whether it can transcend the respective differences each country has in its relations with China.\n\nThere is, however, a more fundamental point being made in this speech. Much of the post-Cold War euphoria of the last thirty years, with its giddy talk of transnationalism, quite rightly turned its back on the snarling nationalisms that had ignited two world wars and unleashed so much violence and bloodshed across the world last century.\n\nBut the accompanying requiems for the nation-state itself were premature. Whatever its imperfections, the nation remains the key organising principle of government and ideas of community. Today\u2019s global challenges tend still to be tackled regionally or nationally.\n\nHerein lies the challenge for Morrison. He needs to be careful lest his remarks, which climb rather too easily onto the bandwagon of bagging internationalism, inadvertently let a rather raggedy nationalistic cat out of the bag. His real task, as it is for other leaders around the world, is to figure out how to reconfigure the nation-state so that it might adapt to the challenges of this century. And that will surely require involve a much bolder domestic reform agenda than some of his \u2018quiet Australians\u2019 might care for.", "description": "The nation-state never went away.
