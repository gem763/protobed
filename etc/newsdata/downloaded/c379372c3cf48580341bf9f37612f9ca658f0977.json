Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, businessman Andrew Yang and businessman Tom Steyer could all fail to qualify for the November debates if they do not improve their polling standing.\n\nUnder the new rules, candidates will have to demonstrate they have 165,000 unique donors, an increase of 30,000 from October. They will also have to meet a polling criteria, either by scoring 3 percent in at least four national or state polls approved by the national party, or by receiving 5 percent or more in two approved single-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.\n\nThe polls must be released between September 13 and one week before the date of the November debate, which has not yet been announced.\n\nCastro has not received at least 3 percent in a party-sanctioned poll since late June. Booker\u2019s last poll at that level came in mid-August. Klobuchar hit 3 percent in an Iowa poll this weekend, her first since early August. Yang also regularly falls below the 3 percent threshold, though he notched 4 percent in a national September survey.\n\nSteyer, who entered the race late in July, has only reached 3 percent in a single poll in early August.", "description": "New rules require candidates to receive at least 3 percent in multiple polls and attract 165,000 donors.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/j1btiSfs872bIeThM50ln5zG8n0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ERG4SEG2M4I6TP5RQSMIONUUOY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
