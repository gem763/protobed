In exchange for the U.S. not imposing more tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing would agree to increase its purchases of agricultural products, the report said.\n\nIn a separate report, The Financial Times said China is offering to purchase 50 percent more U.S. agricultural products, raising its total to $30 billion annually.\n\nHigh-level U.S.-China trade talks are set to resume Thursday in Washington. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will lead the Chinese delegation while U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightheizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will spearhead the U.S. team. It was reported on Tuesday that Liu does not have the special envoy designation that would allow him to make a deal with a stamp of approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nWednesday's reports come as the U.S. has increased the pressure on China.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. State Department imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials for human rights repression in Xinjiang.

They do something on intellectual property, you know they promised Obama twice they wouldn't steal anymore. They can certainly promise Trump they won't steal anymore. Then in return, he delays the next round of tariffs which gives our consumers a break at the holiday season.\"", "description": "China would be open to buying more agricultural products in exchange for the U.S. not imposing more tariffs on its products.", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/AP19224465702240.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
