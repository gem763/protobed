'We looked at it the first month (of the season) and now it's gone.\n\n'They should have been retaken, the keeper is off his line by a yard. But I remember the World Cup in 2014 when Van Gaal took (Jasper) Cillessen off, he (Krul) is clever in his mannerism as well.'\n\nKrul has been admired for his ability to keep out spot kicks as was seen in the 2014 World Cup\n\nHis two saves weren't even the highlight of his afternoon with a trio of one on one saves\n\nFarke said the VAR decision to overrule referee Stuart Attwell for the first penalty was 'quite obviously a mistake'.\n\n'The referee was right not to give a penalty and then two minutes of VAR to check it,' he added. 'The rule is for a 100 per cent clear and obvious mistake.'\n\nIt says something about Krul's performance on Sunday that the pair of penalty saves weren't even the highlight of his performance.\n\nThe 31-year-old produced a stunning reflex save to turn Martial's point-blank header over the bar in the first half. He also denied Rashford, Martial and substitute Mason Greenwood when they were through on goal.\n\nBoth Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Daniel Farke shared their views on the use of VAR technology\n\nTwice VAR was used to determine whether United should have been awarded a penalty\n\nKrul did it all despite suffering a knee injury that he first feared could be a recurrence of ruptured cruciate ligament in 2015.\n\nHe limped away from Carrow Road afterwards but Farke is hopeful that scans on Monday will show that the injury isn't too bad.\n\n'It was a great performance but I'm concerned that he overstretched his knee,' said the Norwich manager, who also lost Jamal Lewis to illness and Ibrahim Amadou to injury.\n\n'Tim was panicking because he has had an experience with an ACL before. It doesn't seem too bad. It has to settle down and we have to see what the doctor says.'", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER AT CARROW ROAD: It says something about Krul's performance on Sunday that the pair of penalty saves weren't even the highlight of his performance.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20255002-0-image-a-14_1572209393284.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
