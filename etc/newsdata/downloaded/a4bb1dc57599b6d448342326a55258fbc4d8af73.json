(Claire M. L. Bourne)\n\nThe handwriting was oddly familiar.\n\nUniversity of Cambridge lecturer Jason Scott-Warren peered closer at the article he was reading \u2014 especially its photos of anonymous marginal scratchings in a 17th-century edition of William Shakespeare\u2019s plays. It couldn\u2019t be, he told himself, setting aside his sandwich during a lunch break last week. Surely that wasn\u2019t John Milton\u2019s handwriting?\n\nScott-Warren jumped up, ran to the library and began comparing the photos with Cambridge copies of Milton\u2019s scribblings.\n\n\u201cI just got more and more persuaded by the idea: This could be Milton, which was strange and unbelievable,\u201d said Scott-Warren, who studies ancient handwriting. \u201cI sat there for hours, surrounded by books, trying to stop people seeing what I was up to.\u201d\n\nAfter a day of frenetic research and \u201cmuch fretting,\u201d he published a blog post suggesting the 17th-century text \u2014 tucked away in relative obscurity in the Free Library of Philadelphia since 1944 \u2014 was in fact John Milton\u2019s personal annotated copy of Shakespeare\u2019s first folio, published in 1623 and the first collected edition of the bard\u2019s plays. Scott-Warren\u2019s post sent academics around the world into a tizzy, prompting some to hail it as the most significant literary discovery in recent memory.\n\nScott-Warren knew it was \u201ca big claim to make.\u201d Milton, the author of \u201cParadise Lost,\u201d is regarded by some as second in prestige and influence only to Shakespeare in the English canon. Shakespeare, of course, needs no introduction.\n\n\u201cWe now have firsthand evidence \u2014 literally, firsthand evidence \u2014 of arguably the second-greatest 17th-century writer reading the first,\u201d said Rhodri Lewis, an English professor at Princeton University who has studied Milton and Shakespeare. \u201cThat\u2019s an absolutely extraordinary thing.\u201d\n\n[Who art thou, Shakespeare?]\n\nLewis, along with several other professors contacted by The Washington Post, said the evidence presented in Scott-Warren\u2019s blog post, while not 100 percent conclusive, is highly convincing. William Poole, a fellow at the University of Oxford who studies and teaches Milton, said the similarities go beyond handwriting: The anonymous commentator does \u201cexactly the things Milton does\u201d when annotating books and uses identical markings.\n\nIf Milton\u2019s authorship is proved beyond doubt, Poole and other experts said, the text probably marks modern scholars\u2019 best shot at understanding a literary relationship that helped shape Milton as an author. Though Milton and Shakespeare never met \u2014 Shakespeare died in 1616, while Milton was born in 1608 \u2014 Milton was a fervent admirer of the bard, at one point writing in a poem that Shakespeare was the \u201cdear son of Memory, great heir of fame.\u201d\n\nMilton\u2019s marginalia range from line-editing \u2014 crossing out an adjective and offering an alternative \u2014 to flagging preferred passages to fixing Shakespeare\u2019s meter, ensuring it conforms perfectly to the rules of iambic pentameter. At one point, Milton rewrites the title of what may be Shakespeare\u2019s most famous work: The play becomes \u201cJuliet and Romeo,\u201d not vice versa.\n\nThe annotated text could afford greater insight into Milton\u2019s mode of literary analysis and thus his development as a great writer in his own right, experts said.\n\n\u201cThis may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times,\u201d Poole said. \u201cTo hope that we might have the copy belonging to the next great poet in the language \u2026 was just too much. But in fact the book [was] hiding in plain sight.\u201d\n\n\n\nWilliam Shakespeare. (iStock/iStock)\n\nIt almost stayed hidden.\n\nThe folio surfaced only after the painstaking efforts of Claire M.L. Bourne, an English professor at Pennsylvania State University who in part studies how people have read books throughout history. She began examining the text while a PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania, traveling to the Philadelphia Free Library reading room to pore over the text in person. She quickly became fascinated by the folio and its unnamed annotator, whom she never suspected might be Milton.\n\nBourne came to cherish particular edits. For example, the time the commenter suggested \u201cwicked tongue\u201d instead of \u201cidle tongue\u201d in Hamlet. Or the time he proposed that Juliet was \u201cpast hope, past cure, past help\u201d instead of \u201cpast hope, past care, past help\u201d in \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a particular kind of engagement with the text \u2014 a very precise, granular engagement with the text \u2014 that really excited me,\u201d she said.\n\nBourne spent 10 years studying the text before finally publishing her findings in late 2018 \u2014 an article part of an essay collection published in the book \u201cEarly Modern English Marginalia\u201d that prompted Scott-Warren\u2019s \u201cEureka!\u201d moment.\n\nScott-Warren, who also wrote an article published in the collection, picked up the book last week because he wanted to read everyone else\u2019s essays. The evening after he stumbled across Bourne\u2019s essay, he reached out on Twitter to ask whether she thought his theory about Milton plausible. After securing her blessing, Scott-Warren published his blog post the next day.\n\n[Five myths about William Shakespeare]\n\nThings immediately took off on social media, with other professors \u2014 including many Milton experts \u2014 weighing in to declare the findings legitimate. Some posted photos of other examples of Milton\u2019s writing, pointing out further similarities that strengthened Scott-Warren\u2019s argument. Others offered their congratulations on a field-altering find.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly exciting and rare for scholars to have any new document that can give us a glimpse into the way an early writer wrote,\u201d said Aaron Pratt, a curator of early books and manuscripts at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cImmensely more exciting, needless to say, if the document shows one of England\u2019s most famous writers in conversation with the most famous one.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s more work to be done.\n\nFirst, Scott-Warren and Bourne need to conduct additional research to prove the anonymous annotator is truly Milton, Pratt said. They will need to go through every single annotation in the folio and pair it with a known example of Milton\u2019s writing, according to Pratt \u2014 the closest the duo can possibly come to \u201csmoking gun-level proof,\u201d he said. Scott-Warren and Bourne said they plan to co-write a paper doing exactly that.\n\nIf all goes well, the pair can also start guessing what the annotations reveal about their author. Though Bourne has already examined the marginalia hundreds of times, she said she is excited to review it all again \u2014 because, this time, she\u2019ll be entering Milton\u2019s head.\n\n[Don't worry. Yale still teaches Shakespeare.]\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Milton may have made the marginalia and revisions. But \u2014 despite the man\u2019s well-documented massive ego \u2014 Scott-Warren, Bourne and experts cautioned against the idea that Milton saw himself as a superior writer entitled to edit Shakespeare.\n\nIt was more likely that Milton saw himself as correcting others\u2019 errors \u2014 saving Shakespeare, who died seven years before the folio appeared, from the printer, according to Scott-Warren.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about wanting to do it better than Shakespeare; I think it\u2019s about appreciating the immense potential of the texts,\u201d Scott-Warren said. \u201cMilton is a real admirer of Shakespeare. He thinks Shakespeare is a brilliant writer, and he wants the text to be as brilliant as it can be.\u201d\n\nWhat is clear is that the value of the folio, already high, just jumped immeasurably. Pristine copies of Shakespeare\u2019s first folio have sold for immense amounts of money: In 2001, a copy sold in New York for more than $6 million. The Free Library \u2014 which obtained the book when the family of Joseph E. Widener donated it to the library after the wealthy Philadelphia businessman and philanthropist\u2019s death \u2014 declined to give an estimate of the folio\u2019s price, but Pratt had a guess.\n\n\u201cThis would be worth millions of dollars plural; nothing like it has ever come on the market,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cIt would go for more than any copy ever sold.\u201d\n\nHe paused and laughed. \u201cOf course, [the Free Library] is never, ever going to sell.\u201d\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\nRobert Frost wrote this masterpiece in about 20 minutes.
