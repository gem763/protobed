The events led the NBA to cancel all media and a players\u2019 press conference.\n\n\u201cWhat's happening in the NBA is going to shift things in a much more dramatic direction, and the U.S. government has become a lot more involved in this pushback against the Beijing pressure on U.S. corporates,\u201d said Leland Miller, CEO of China Beige Book, which operates the largest private data-collection network to track the Chinese marketplace.\n\nMiller noted that it\u2019s not the first time a corporation or organization has had a dust-up with China. \u201dWhat's made the NBA controversy different than previous controversies with hotel chains or airlines is America's starting to pay attention. And what you saw before is it was a bullet point in a newspaper article you read,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. government \u201chas to influence the behavior of businesses who have been thinking myopically for a long time, just to appease the Chinese government in order to get market share. China's this beautiful, potential market for growth, and so they have a lot of pressure to be able to put on individual corporations.\u201d\n\nThe NBA incident represents \u201can inflection point for American public tolerance of Chinese government pressure on corporate bullying.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Lakers' Lebron James, right, drives against Brooklyn Nets' Rodions Kurucs, left, during their preseason NBA game in Shanghai, China, Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019. In response to the NBA defending Daryl Morey's freedom of speech, Chinese officials took it away from the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, with the usual media sessions canceled in Shanghai, including a scheduled news conference from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and postgame news conferences with the teams.

It already sparked a group of politicians on both sides of the aisle. Politicians from Senator Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) penned a letter to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver urging the NBA to suspend activities in China.\n\n\u201cEven the NBA has shut things down, saying, we need to push reset and figure out how to readjust our thinking on this,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think what's happening in the NBA is going to shift things in a much more dramatic direction, and the U.S. government has become a lot more involved in this pushback against the Beijing pressure on U.S. corporates.\u201d\n\nJoanna Campione is a producer for Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "The controversy between the NBA and the Chinese government may trigger action from the U.S. government and corporations.", "authors": ["Joanna Campione"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zxK_SNiiQMqL1vJR83enWw--~B/aD0xNTY2O3c9MjM1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/86e37330-ec51-11e9-bf5d-7fe57652bdad", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
