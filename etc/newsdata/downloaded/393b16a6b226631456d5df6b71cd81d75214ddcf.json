So far, over the past five weeks, Henry Hub\u2019s benchmark contract has rallied only once\u2014gaining nearly 5% last week. In the prior four weeks, it lost 5.9%, 2.2%, 5.1% and 3.1% respectively.\n\nNatural Gas Weekly Chart - Powered by TradingView\n\nJuxtaposed against the market\u2019s performance of a year ago, the comparison looks like night and day.\n\nFor the week ended Oct. 21 2018, benchmark gas futures ended down 2%. But in the five preceding weeks, it rose at a steady beat of 2.8%, 0.6%, 4.5%, 1% and 7.6%.\n\nSome Are Tinkering With Their Pricing Models...\n\nNow, some analysts who had tracked similar cold weather patterns in the mid-September to late October periods of the past two years are rethinking their pricing models.\n\nSaid Myers:\n\n\u201cThe front month continues to garner support from coming cold weather, although not so much that it can break through resistance at $2.30.\u201d\n\nDominick Chirichella, who studies market risk and trading models for the Energy Management Institute in New York, had similar thinking to Myers, saying any gains lately \u201cwere likely the result of short covering\u201d.\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cThe latest short-term temperature forecast is still projecting colder than normal temperatures across most of the U.S.\u201d\n\n...Others Are Convinced The Market Won\u2019t Rally Until 2020\n\nSome analysts, like Scott Shelton at ICAP in Durham, North Carolina, think the market won\u2019t have what it takes for a price breakout until probably early 2020.\n\nWrote Shelton in a Wednesday report:\n\n\u201cThe flat price seems listless but appears to go down much easier than it goes up as the winter optimism that we had last year due to low storage into winter simply isn\u2019t there this year.\u201d\n\nHe said his view was \u201cslowly changing to neutral or bearish\", noting \"the optics of don\u2019t look very good here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe demand side did not disappoint in terms of weather this year, once again with solid power demand. But yet here we are\u2026near the lows. That\u2019s \u2018telling\u2019 to me. All of the winter spreads in Q1 look overvalued to me, when you take last year out of the picture.\u201d", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Barani Krishnan/Investing.com) covering: Natural Gas Futures.
