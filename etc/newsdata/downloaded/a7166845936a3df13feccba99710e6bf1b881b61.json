Pictures)\n\nTurns out Joaquin Phoenix is a pretty chilled man to please on the Joker set, with his co-star Josh Pais revealing his only request.\n\nAfter being recruited by director Todd Phillips for the backstory piece to Batman\u2019s antagonist, Josh was brought up to speed on the kind of co-star Joaquin was looking for.\n\nPretty simply: \u2018No a**holes\u2019.\n\nSeems fair enough, right? We\u2019re sure you\u2019d wish to make such a stipulation to your boss in your next job interview too.\n\nJosh plays the boss of Joaquin\u2019s Arthur Fleck, Hoyt Vaughn, who recruits and then unceremoniously fires him as a clown-for-hire. It\u2019s from here in the dark film we see Arthur\u2019s descent into violent madness.\n\nJosh starred as Arthur\u2019s boss (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I had a meeting with Todd,\u2019 Josh said in a chat with The Hollywood Reporter. \u2018He said, \u201cI loved your tape. I just want to make sure that you\u2019re not an a**hole because one person on set can really ruin the whole vibe of the thing\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u2018Joaquin told Todd, \u201cI don\u2019t care who you cast, just make sure everybody is a really good actor \u2014 and no a**holes.\u201d So, I guess I passed the test.\u2019\n\nNot a bad seal of approval, right?\n\nStill, as Josh added: \u2018I played an a**hole!\u2019\n\nMaybe the film\u2019s cinematographer didn\u2019t get the memo though\u2026\n\nJoker was released worldwide earlier this month and already it has become a huge global hit.
