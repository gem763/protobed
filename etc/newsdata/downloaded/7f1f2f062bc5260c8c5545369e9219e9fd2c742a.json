It claimed the lives of a high-school student and a U.S. Postal Service employee, among others.\n\nOdessa officials said Ator used an assault rifle-type weapon, but said how the gun was obtained is still under investigation. Police said that there is \u201cno definite motive known,\u201d and the FBI said that a preliminary investigation determined that the shooting is not connected to domestic or international terrorism.\n\nThe FBI said during the press conference that they were executing a federal search warrant at a home linked to the gunman. Agents were later seen searching Ator\u2019s house, located about 20 minutes west of Odessa. The home, set half a mile back from the main road, more closely resembles a shack, with what appears to be a makeshift tower placed on top. The area is surrounded by oil wells that easily outnumber the nearby trailers.\n\nJustin Hamel/For The Daily Beast More\n\nAtor\u2019s name was reported earlier in the day by several news outlets and initially confirmed to The Daily Beast by two law enforcement officials who shared the name on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAtor, who has a previous criminal record for trespassing and resisting arrest, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety records obtained by The Daily Beast, was killed in a shoot-out with police.\n\nAtor was pulled over by Odessa police shortly after 3 p.m. Saturday when he opened fire through the back window of his vehicle, before going on a shooting spree that spanned from Odessa to Midland\u2014at one point, he hijacked a U.S. Postal Service van\u2014and ended with him being killed during a gun battle with police in a movie theater parking lot.", "description": "Texas Department of Public SafetyODESSA, Texas\u2014The gunman who killed seven people and injured roughly 20 others during a 20-mile trail of carnage across West Texas was identified by law enforcement on Sunday as 36-year-old Seth Aaron Ator.
