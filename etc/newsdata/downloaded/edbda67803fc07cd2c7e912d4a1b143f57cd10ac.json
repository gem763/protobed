Photo: courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox\n\nWe\u2019ve already written about shaving, trimming, brushing, and conditioning beards. But the first and perhaps the most important step to maintaining a healthy and nice-looking beard is keeping it clean. During the day, your beard collects the microscopic dust and debris that\u2019s constantly in the air. It also comes into contact with germs, odors, and whatever else you deposit when you touch it with your hands, smoke, make out with someone, eat, or drink. According to dermatologist Morgan Rabach of LM Medical in NYC, \u201cWashing your beard every day not only cleans it of food particles and saliva, which carry germs, but will prevent the buildup in your pores that can lead to beardruff and acne.\u201d While some would argue that beards don\u2019t need a dedicated product to stay clean, buying soaps and washes designed for facial hair lets you target beard-specific problems that regular shampoo may not address or could exacerbate. For example, Rabach suggests avoiding sulfates and other harsh ingredients commonly found in shampoo, which can irritate and dry out the skin on your face. To help you find the best beard wash, bar soap, or combination face and beard wash for you, we spoke to Rabach and seven other beard experts.\n\nBest overall beard wash\n\nJack Black Beard Wash Three of the seven experts we spoke to recommend Jack Black beard wash because it\u2019s formulated for beards and the skin underneath. Rabach specifically cites the aloe-leaf juice powder, which \u201chelps soothe dryness and irritation\u201d \u2014 issues that most men with beards will experience. Eliut Rivera, founder of Eliut Salon, likes that Jack Black\u2019s wash both cleanses and conditions facial hair. The best beard products \u201cincorporate rich, moisturizing ingredients such as aloe, camelina oil, and shea butter,\u201d he says. This wash has all three of those ingredients, plus jojoba oil, vitamin B5, and organic sea kelp to help balance your skin\u2019s moisture levels. Annette Moore, owner of Boldbarber.com, agrees that it does a great job, and she likes that it has a fresh and pleasant scent, thanks to the added grapefruit, rosemary, and basil. $18 at Amazon Buy $18 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest overall less-expensive beard wash\n\nHonest Amish Original Beard and Body Soap In both of our recent articles about beard oil and beard balm, Honest Amish products came in at the top or close to it. So it\u2019s no surprise that their organic beard soap was also a favorite among these experts. Both Rabach and Torrey Grobes of Paul Labrecque Salon are fans of this all-natural soap, which is made with super-moisturizing (and only slightly fragrant) ingredients including virgin olive oil, virgin pumpkin-seed oil, apricot-kernel oil, palm kernels, and lavender. Grobes suggests \u201crubbing the bar against your beard for about 15 seconds, or until you have a rich, sudsy lather.\u201d Make sure to \u201cget all the way to the base of your beard follicles,\u201d he says, and let it sit on your beard for a couple minutes before rinsing out. He says Honest Amish soap improves skin tone, softens beard hairs, and adds fullness to create a healthier and nicer-looking beard. Rabach also points out that this is a \u201cgreat price point\u201d for such high-quality ingredients. $9 at Amazon Buy $9 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard wash for dry skin\n\nMaapilim Beard Wash Two of our beard experts \u2014 Rabach and Tony DeAngelis, owner of Blue & Black Barbers and Apothecary in Brooklyn \u2014 recommended this cedar-citrus-and-lavender-scented beard wash from Tel Aviv\u2013based grooming brand Maapilim. \u201cI am loving it right now,\u201d says DeAngelis, who believes in a less-is-more approach to beard care. Like other beard products, he says, a good beard wash should contain \u201ccarrier oils such as argan or jojoba oil.\u201d He also advises staying away from parabens and harsh chemicals. (Maapilim beard wash is paraben-, alcohol-, and sodium lauryl sulfate\u2013free.) Rabach highlighted the same essentail oils, which he calls a \u201cdeeply moisturizing and fortifying\u201d mix, and says they make this beard wash specifically effective for people with dry skin. $27 at Maapilim Buy\n\nBest beard wash for beardruff\n\nViking Revolution Beard Wash Shampoo w/Argan & Jojoba Oils Moore also likes this beard wash, which she says is highly effective and will last a long time, since you need to use only a little bit at a time. Rabach likes the \u201cplant-based\u201d ingredients, including peppermint and eucalyptus, which add an invigorating smell and have an astringent effect that helps fight dandruff. This wash also contains Argan and jojoba oil to help soften facial hair and add lightweight moisture to skin. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest-smelling beard wash\n\nBrass Knuckle Beard & Body Wash \u201cAlways look for a facial-hair wash that is free of harsh chemicals or sulfates,\u201d says beard-care expert Matt Benevento, who recommends this Austin-based brand. In addition to coconut and sunflower oils, Brass Knuckle contains moisturizing and follicle-strengthening rose-hip-seed oil, camelina-seed oil, and oat protein. There\u2019s also a nice blend of aromatic essential oils to make your beard smell more like a forest and less like the burger you ate last night. $23 at The Bearded Bastard Buy\n\nBest moisturizing beard soap\n\nMr Natty's Forest Face Beard Soap $19 (was $26, now 27% off) A lot of people think bar soaps will dry out your skin, but it\u2019s not the form that a cleanser takes that matters. It\u2019s the ingredients. Moore recommends this olive-oil-and-shea-butter-based soap in a tin. It\u2019s \u201cperfect for everybody, even those with sensitive skin,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is truly a great product that cleans, moisturizes, and soothes.\u201d Mr. Natty\u2019s is also sulfate- and paraben-free and contains scents of rosemary and peppermint to keep your facial hair (and you) smelling fresh. As with the Honest Amish bar soap, make sure you massage the lather throughout your beard and down to the skin underneath. Then rinse with warm water until all of the product is gone. $19 at Amazon Buy $19 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest frizz-fighting beard wash\n\nBilly Jealousy Beard Wash Lucas Dennington, grooming expert for The Insider Guide to Spas, likes Billy Jealousy beard wash because of its smoothing properties. To give your beard a smoother, less wacky appearance, this beard wash uses aloe-leaf juice, which works to soften and rehydrate thirsty skin and facial hair; soy proteins to add shine and conditioning, leaving your beard manageable and frizz-free; and green-tea extract, which strengthens damaged whiskers from root to tip. $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest beard wash for sensitive skin\n\nFellow Summer Wash If your skin reacts to new products by breaking out or turning bright red, choosing a gentle all-natural beard wash is very important. Rabach likes Fellow Summer for sensitive skin \u201cbecause there are no harsh detergents, the fragrance is 100 percent natural, and it\u2019s alcohol-free, paraben-free, and sulfate-free.\u201d All of which means it won\u2019t irritate or dry out your skin \u2014 alcohol in particular will zap your skin of its natural moisture. Other key ingredients include nourishing meadowfoam oil, mango butter, and jojoba oil. Plus, it\u2019s made to be used interchangeably on your hair or your beard, which is nice since it means you can buy less stuff. $26 at Fellow Barber Buy\n\nBest face wash that also works for beards\n\nHuron Cleanse and Exfoliate Face Wash When we wrote about everything you need to trim your beard, Laura Leverty, owner of Paper Hair Salon in Minneapolis, told us that she starts every beard trim in her salon with a vigorous beard wash to remove dirt and dead skin. For this task Leverty suggests finding a face wash that\u2019s both gentle and exfoliating to help prevent beardruff and clogged pores. She uses this sulfate-free cleanser from Huron because of its \u201cshave-cream-like\u201d texture and tiny bamboo particles that are easy to work into the skin under a beard. $14 at Huron Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
