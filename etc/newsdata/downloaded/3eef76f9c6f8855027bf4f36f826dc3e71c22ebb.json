None of these relatives, however, arouse such strong feelings as pizza, something nearer to a religion than a mere bread, with cults devoted to the worship and defence of its various incarnations \u2013 woe betide the person who wanders into a temple of the Neapolitan pie and asks for a ham and pineapple, or indeed the fool who demands a thin and crispy base in old-school Chicago.\n\nRachel Roddy\u2019s recipe for pizza | A kitchen in Rome Read more\n\nThe one thing most fanatics can agree on, however, is that it\u2019s impossible to make a \u201cproper pizza\u201d at home \u2013 you can\u2019t get a home oven up to the searing temperatures of a commercial appliance, whether wood-fired or not. Less obsessive disciples can, however, knock-up a pretty decent facsimile, either by heating their oven for hours and faffing around with baking stones, or by sticking a frying pan on the hob. The choice is yours.\n\nThe flour\n\nThe fact that this is a bread should give you a clue as to the best type of flour to use. You can make pizza with plain flour, as J Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipe on the Serious Eats website recommends. (Though he himself prefers \u201cfancy\u201d Italian flour, he says the differences are marginal enough for it not to be a necessity.) But, because a good base is chewy and bubbly, rather than flat and crunchy, a higher protein flour is a better bet. This is because the higher the protein content, the more gluten will develop in the dough. This much-maligned matrix is the thing that gives dough its elasticity, allowing it to stretch into beautiful big, blistered bubbles in the oven, rather than staying resolutely solid, like one of those boxed supermarket pizza bases that passed for authentic in the 1980s, but now resemble nothing more than a Bath Oliver biscuit.\n\nWhich is all to say that higher protein flours, like the strong bread flour used by Olivia Potts in her book A Half-Baked Idea, or the 00 flour often sold as pasta flour in British supermarkets are a better choice. The latter is particularly good because it\u2019s so finely milled (00 refers to the grade), which makes for a particularly delicate, crisp crust.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sainsbury\u2019s magazine\u2019s version uses a herby, 00 flour-based dough.\n\nNote that if you use bread flour, or indeed plain flour, you may want to add a little more water: the very fine texture means that you need less \u2013 Lopez-Alt\u2019s recipe comes in at 75% hydration (the weight of water being 75% that of the weight of flour) and Potts\u2019 70%, while the two I try using 00 flour, from Franco Manca founder Giuseppe Mascoli and that of the Pizza Pilgrims, call for 59% and 60% hydration respectively. (More water makes the dough harder to work with, but also makes the finished product lighter and bubblier; I think we\u2019ve already established we\u2019re all about the bubbles here).\n\nThe raising agents\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: we all dream of homemade pizza that\u2019s quicker than a takeaway, so I decide to try a recipe from Sainsbury\u2019s magazine using baking powder, rather than the traditional yeast, leaving it to rest for a mere 30 minutes before baking. The results, though not unpleasant, are more like a pitta than a pizza \u2013 great if you have a lot of hungry and fairly indiscriminate mouths to feed in a hurry, but not one for the pizza aficionado.\n\nLeaving aside sourdough pizzas, which are a whole different kettle of anchovies, there\u2019s no substitute for yeast, and yeast takes time to work its magic; how much is an interesting matter. The recipes I try range from a 10-hour rise and proof as the minimum for L\u00f3pez-Alt\u2019s recipe, to a five-day rise for Potts\u2019 pizza, with the Pizza Pilgrims describing 24 hours as \u201coptimal\u201d. The difference is largely due to the fact that Potts\u2019 and Mascoli\u2019s doughs both rise in the fridge, in a process known as cold fermentation. This slows the action of the yeast, but gives the finished product a better flavour and texture (apparently cold fermentation results in stronger gluten networks). You\u2019ll need to bring it back to room temperature before shaping and cooking, but in this instance, patience is very much a virtue: if you want a truly complex flavour, you need to plan ahead.\n\nNot too far ahead though; L\u00f3pez-Alt has done some interesting research on this very subject, and concludes that a rise time of between three and five days is optimal: \u201cEventually, even at cold temperatures, the yeast will start to produce a large amount of those sour milk aromas, throwing off the flavour of your bread. And there\u2019s an even bigger problem: as the alcohol content and acidity of the dough rises, eventually it gets so high that the yeast simply ceases to operate.\u201d\n\nI reckon three days is plenty, but that may be because I find it very hard to wait any longer for my pizza.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Franco Manca founder Giuseppe Mascoli deep-fries his pizza \u2013 with delicious results.\n\nThe flavouring\n\nSalt is a must in pizza dough and, though it\u2019s frowned upon by purists, I\u2019m not too snooty to add a little sugar to help the yeast along and give a more complex flavour, though you can leave it out if you prefer. While olive oil gives a pleasing flavour, it also softens the texture, so I\u2019m not going to use it \u2013 and I\u2019d prefer to save herbs for the top, rather than adding them to the dough, as Sainsbury\u2019s suggest.\n\nThe method\n\nThe most important thing I learn, very belatedly, is that a cast-iron pan is the best tool for cooking pizza on the hob: nonstick pans are out for safety reasons, and my stainless -steel pan turned out some great pizza, but at the expense of its shiny silver base. The cast-iron skillet recommended by Potts, however, produces perfect results: if you have one, use it.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to grease it, unless you\u2019re actually deep-frying the pizzas, as in Mascoli\u2019s recipe \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to report these are excessively good). Just get it good and hot, though not so hot it burns the base before it cooks through \u2013 you might need to experiment a bit with the first batch to find out what works for your pan.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Alt, in a quest to eliminate the need for an oven entirely, recommends cooking the dough on both sides with a lid on, and then browning the crust by turning it in a gas flame, or with a blowtorch. This works well if you don\u2019t happen to have a grill, but it\u2019s much easier, and I think better texture-wise, to char the bottom on the hob and then transfer it to a hot grill to brown the top, and to melt any cheese. (Make sure your toppings are at room temperature as Lopez-Alt cautions, or they will take too long to warm up).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A 24-hour prove is sufficient to get Pizza Pilgrims\u2019 dough ready for cooking.\n\nThe toppings\n\nOn which point, I\u2019m happy for you to top your pizza with whatever you like, even chicken (the horror), but all the recipes I try call for a classic mozzarella and tomato combo, often with a few leaves of basil, or \u201cif you\u2019re feeling truly nostalgic\u201d, as Potts puts it, a sprinkling of dried oregano. She also makes a buttery, garlicky, oniony sauce, a \u201cbastardisation\u201d of a Marcella Hazan recipe so delicious, I eat it with a spoon, but it feels like gilding the lily here: Mascoli\u2019s simple simmered tomatoes, with a pinch of salt and sugar, give a purer tomato hit. He explains his topping is oil-free because the pizzette will be deep-fried, but in fact I prefer it even for dry-fried pizzas; you can always drizzle some oil on top before serving.\n\nCheese-wise, you can\u2019t beat buffalo mozzarella (note: if you want to use firmer pizza mozzarella, you may need to deploy a blowtorch to help it melt, because it will take longer than the wetter stuff). Sainsbury\u2019s also add parmesan, roasted peppers and cherry tomatoes, but, a few herbs aside, I don\u2019t think it needs anything else for perfection. Eat immediately, and certainly fast enough to burn your tongue: it\u2019s worth it.\n\nPerfect frying-pan pizza\n\nRise 3-5 days\n\nPrep 5 min\n\nCook 35 min\n\nMakes 4\n\n500g Italian 00 flour, plus extra to dust\n\n1\u00bd tsp dried active yeast\n\n1 tsp fine salt\n\n1 tsp sugar (optional)\n\nTo top\n\n1 400g tin chopped plum tomatoes\n\n1 ball buffalo mozzarella\n\n1 bunch basil, or a sprinkle of dried oregano\n\nExtra-virgin olive oil, to drizzle\n\nMix the flour, yeast, salt and sugar then stir in 325ml water to a smooth dough.
