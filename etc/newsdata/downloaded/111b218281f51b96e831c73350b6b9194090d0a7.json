I don\u2019t have the money to send her to Queen\u2019s Gate, in South Kensington, a fee-paying school where my parents sent me, in the days before it cost an arm and a leg.\n\nPerhaps she\u2019s had a lucky escape. It seems that pick-ups with a driver are now the norm at the school \u2013 how would I, with my clapped out VW Golf covered in dog hair, ever keep up? But at the same time, I\u2019m not sure she could handle the local school of hard knocks either.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

If it\u2019s good enough for the ex-PM, it\u2019s good enough for me.\n\nLucky, really, that I got on the case so quickly. You have to attend the church\u2019s Sunday school with your baby, from the age of six months for three years to have any chance of getting to the top of the admissions pile.\n\nInitially, I felt a bit of a fraud for going because I used to have an aversion to organised religion \u2013 but now I love sitting in the grand church. It's useful time to reflect. Does that mean I've become spiritual?\n\nWe always light a candle for Alex, who will have died five years ago at the end of this month. I take a moment to feel grateful that I already had his frozen sperm when he died and that after tons of gruelling IVF rounds, I finally became a mum. And when I look at Liberty now, who spent two years stored in a freezer as an embryo in an IVF clinic in Alicante, I see Alex; the way he held his shoulders and pursed his lips. It makes me smile.\n\nI\u2019ve met some like-minded friends at church \u2013 none of us wants to pay school fees. But then this isn\u2019t your average church or state school. Only last week I was sitting with all the middle-class parents, including designer-clad Russians and Italians, in a circle at Sunday school, when an Oscar-winning actor walked in with his wife and two children.\n\nEverybody pretended they hadn\u2019t seen the Hollywood A-lister and continued to sing the \u201cHello, It\u2019s good to see you\u201d song before introducing ourselves.\n\nHe didn\u2019t really need an introduction of course, but by the time he said his name and had got to grips with the song booklet, we had launched into: \u201cFather Abraham had many kids, many kids had Father Abraham, You are one of them, and so am I, so let\u2019s all praise the Lord\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s a song that I have to tell Lola to stop singing when we\u2019re out in public: I worry that it makes us look like we\u2019re from a cult.\n\nBy the time we got to cutting out a Jesus figure and sticking coloured pom-poms on it, the Oscar-winning actor had become the elephant in the room. Then I thought to myself: what the heck is he doing here? Surely he doesn\u2019t need to be here to get his kids into this church school, like some of the congregation? He must be religious! And indeed he is, I later found out, via Google.\n\n\n\nOk, I have to drag myself out of bed with a toddler and a baby, and sing child-friendly religious songs at 9.30 on a Sunday morning. But it\u2019s not like I have anyone at home to chew the fat with or join me for a leisurely read of the Sunday papers. A trip to the church\u2019s playgroup is a welcome break from childcare. And surely this is better than a price tag of more than \u00a3100,000 each to get them both privately educated until the age of 11.\n\nNow, after three years of attendance, I really look forward to going and catching up with the people I\u2019ve met there and feeling part of a community. I finally get the form for the vicar to sign \u2013 and they check my church attendance. All is good. It\u2019s no guarantee, but I pray to God that she gets in.", "description": "I couldn\u2019t get Lola\u2019s primary school situation sorted fast enough.
