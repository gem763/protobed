This is why the $1.6 trillion issue could play a big part in the 2020 election. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA \u2013 While Aaron Greene was packing to head back to Clark Atlanta University for his junior year, he stumbled upon a college bill at his mother\u2019s house in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The number was so large that he figured it had to be a phone number.\n\n\u201cI know my mother is not paying this much money for school,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nThough his mother, Di-Anne, already had $40,000 in student loans from her own graduate school education, she has taken out $42,000 in Parent PLUS Loans for Aaron \u2013 and she had kept him in the dark about the cost.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to give him the pressure of starting out in college, worrying about grades as well as the finances,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I probably should have (told him) so that he could get a better understanding of the sacrifice that\u2019s been made.\u201d\n\nAaron Greene and his mother Di-Anne.

The federal government\u2019s Parent PLUS program helps make attending college a reality, closing the gap between the cost of college and what the student receives in grants and other loans.\n\nThough it may sound like a lifeline, the Parent PLUS Loan program can cause economic complications for families.\n\nSix-figure debts\n\nThe loan program was introduced in the 1980s as a way for middle- and upper-income parents to help their children pay for college while keeping their assets liquid. It has since become more popular among lower-income parents. That's possible because the program does not check the ability to repay, considering only the borrower's credit history.\n\nWhen parents borrow, the debt can weigh down families for generations. But the burden falls particularly hard on low-income black families.\n\nFew white families with low incomes take out the loan \u2013 just 10% of white Parent PLUS borrowers earn $30,000 or less. Comparatively, 40% of black Parent PLUS borrowers have incomes that low.\n\nAtlanta colleges illustrate this dichotomy of borrowing.\n\nParents of students at three of the city\u2019s historically black colleges \u2013 Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College and Spelman College \u2013 combined took out more than $102 million in Parent PLUS Loans in 2018. Meanwhile, parents of students at majority-white Emory University \u2013 which has nearly the same number of students as those three historically black colleges and universities together \u2013 borrowed only $7 million in Parent PLUS Loans that year.\n\nMorehouse students attend a session on scholarships at Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel during new student orientation.

The program has existed long enough for families to see one of the consequences of taking out large loans: generations of overlapping debt.\n\nIn Texas, Prairie View A&M University graduate Tania White needed her mother to take out Parent PLUS Loans for her undergraduate education 30 years ago. White\u2019s mother borrowed $12,000 for White\u2019s three years of college. She is still paying it back. Since White\u2019s graduation in 1992, her mother\u2019s debt has accrued to more than $100,000. White said the interest rate on Evans\u2019 $100,000 debt is about 9%.\n\n\u201cYou know how something is so outrageous where you have no expression or feeling behind it? That\u2019s where we are with that,\u201d White said, remarking that paying back student debt has become a routine for her family.\n\nLoan forgiveness: Betsy DeVos rule change means college students must fight for it\n\nDespite seeing her mother\u2019s debt accumulate, White resorted to Parent PLUS Loans to pay for her daughter\u2019s trip to study abroad. White now owes more than $200,000 between her own and her children\u2019s student debt.\n\nThis generational pattern of borrowing is not uncommon, since the Parent PLUS program casts debt across all generations \u2013 not just young people affected by federal student loans.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be the group that breaks generational poverty,\u201d said Joy Evans, mother of a Paul Quinn College graduate, referring to her family\u2019s three generations of college loan borrowing.\n\nHoping the kids will help\n\nIntergenerational student debt may be a product of the length of time it takes families to repay the hefty loans. Parent PLUS Loans often take five to 20 years to repay because many of the borrowers are approaching retirement age, leaving less opportunity for promotions or time for them to accumulate enough money.\n\nAs a result, some parents said they hope their children will help pay off the PLUS Loans after they graduate. For instance, one father took out Parent PLUS Loans for his youngest daughter to attend Coppin State University in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned and a little worried about the debt,\u201d said Perry Collins. But \u201cit is our hope that (our children) will get to the point where they can provide for themselves.\u201d\n\nCollins said his debt is accumulating quickly between a mortgage and his children\u2019s student loans. He hopes his children will help pay off the debt.\n\nThis woman's dad couldn't help her: She paid off over $222K in student debt anyway. This is how she did it.\n\nFamilies that attend HBCUs are a prime example of the program\u2019s consequences, Collins said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the less privileged and less wealthy that are sending their children out to these things and that\u2019s their only means in most cases.\u201d\n\nParent PLUS Loans may add another struggle: instant repayment. Unlike federal student loans, parent borrowers are expected to immediately begin repaying the loan. Depending on how much they owe, the amount could take decades to pay back, furthering the chance of debt overlapping across generations.\n\nMorehouse mother Vanessa Manley predicted it will take her and her husband 15 to 20 years to pay back their $30,000 in Parent PLUS Loans, but the loans were worth the investment.\n\n\u201cSome parents invest in material things. I invest in my child,\u201d Manley said. Her son started at Morehouse in fall 2019.\n\nFor many parents, the value of sending their child to an HBCU is worth any cost. They see these institutions as pathways to success.\n\nRoderick Hester just dropped off his third daughter at Spelman College. He took out Parent PLUS Loans for each of them. \u201cIf this will give my child the best opportunity to be successful in life,\u201d he said, \u201cThis was the avenue I had to pursue. There wasn't a lot of options.\u201d\n\nRoderick Hester took out loans for his three daughters, all of whom attended Spelman College. (Photo: Ebony JJ Curry, Medill News Service )\n\nHester owes more than $200,000 in Parent PLUS Loans.\n\n\u201cI don't really know how I'm going to pay it back, but I'm planning on it,\u201d Hester said. \u201cWhatever I need to do is what I have to do.\u201d\n\nA billionaire paying off parents' loans\n\nSome parents consider HBCUs a unique opportunity for their children to experience a predominantly black environment.\n\nIn order to pay for her son\u2019s first two years at Morehouse, Carmelita Farrah borrowed $70,000 in Parent PLUS Loans. The idea that he would \u201cexperience his heritage\u201d at Morehouse trumped her financial strain.\n\nMorehouse mom Carmelita Farrah outside of Martin Luther King Jr. International Chapel at Morehouse College. (Photo: Josephine Chu, Medill News Service )\n\n\u201cThe obstacles are stacked against him as a black man, so what will set them apart?\u201d she said. \u201cHopefully an education. After that, a career. Because it\u2019s a struggle. It really is.\u201d\n\nAt Morehouse\u2019s graduation ceremony last May, billionaire Morehouse alum Robert Smith brought national attention to the student loan problem at HBCUs when he made a surprise announcement at graduation: He said he would pay off every 2019 graduate\u2019s student loans. Morehouse later said that gift would include Parent PLUS Loans.\n\nGraduates react after hearing billionaire technology investor and philanthropist Robert F. Smith say he will provide grants to wipe out the student debt of their entire graduating class at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Sunday. (Photo: Steve Schaefer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nStudent debt: What about those of us without a billionaire?\n\nFrank Lawrence Jr., a Morehouse Alumni Association member and 2019 graduate whose debts were cleared by Smith\u2019s gift, said the Alumni Association is \u201ctrying to encourage more alumni to give back.\u201d\n\nOther HBCUs have employed their own strategies to reduce student debt. In 2015, Paul Quinn College implemented a work-study model. The number of parents borrowing PLUS Loans has decreased over the four years since the program\u2019s launch, according to President Michael Sorrell.\n\nIn addition to institutions trying to lower college debt, the nonprofit United Negro College Fund reported that this year alone, it is providing nearly $100 million in scholarships to more than 7,200 students of color. Not every student wins a scholarship, though.\n\n\u201cLoans are almost necessary without any scholarships, but students and their families have to shop around to find the best loans for them,\u201d said Brian Bridges, UNCF\u2019s vice president of research and member engagement.\n\n\u201cParent PLUS Loans are an essential college financing option for some students and parents that can be improved; however, the program must be repaired, not repealed,\u201d Bridges added.\n\nOther experts agree that the Parent PLUS program should be improved.\n\nThe program is \u201cdoing a huge disservice to students of color and families of color when we\u2019re saying that they can borrow however much they want,\u201d said Colleen Campbell, director for postsecondary education at the liberal think tank American Progress.\n\nCampbell added that families should not be allowed to spend more than they can contribute.\n\n\u201cIf a family can only contribute $5,000 to their student\u2019s education in a year,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cthat\u2019s probably the amount you should allow them to borrow.\u201d\n\nHow to use parent loans safely\n\nFor families that have used the federal Direct PLUS Loans, or are considering the loan, experts offer advice about how to navigate the process and make decisions appropriate for their specific case.\n\nLodriguez Murray, vice president of public policy and government affairs for the United Negro College Fund:\n\n\u201cMake sure you and your children are industrious about pursuing opportunities that are not loans before the student goes to school, including applying for other scholarship programs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have to use this tool to finance the education of the student, you are encouraged to have a conversation with the financial aid department at the institution and the counselor that you are offered to understand the terms of the agreement in advance\u201d\n\nRachel Fishman, deputy director for research with the Education Policy Program at New America.\n\nThe only safety mechanism for this loan for low-income families is to consolidate the parent plus loan and get income-contingent payment\n\nKnow that you can\u2019t transfer the loan to students, it\u2019s not a co-signing. You\u2019re taking full responsibility for this debt.\n\nBe aware of how much you\u2019re borrowing and ask, \u2018What are your repayment options?\u2019\n\nAsk whether or not you can handle that burden, especially approaching retirement. Don\u2019t assume you can repay the loan just because you get approved. The federal government can\u2019t make that determination and it is not allowed to.\n\nColleen Campbell, director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress:\n\nTalking to your loan servicer is very important. They have gotten a bad reputation over the last couple of years, but they're really the only ones who can help you manage your loans. That is really important because otherwise, you're not going to get help.\n\nGoing to community college and transferring to a four-year college is a way to reduce costs. It is worthwhile if you know your goal institution is accepting of transfer students - that you are basically guaranteed that your credits are going to transfer.\n\nNoah Broder\n\nThis story was reported by Noah Broder, Ebony Curry, Andre Earls, Apoorva Mittal, Lu Zhao and Priscilla Zhu.
