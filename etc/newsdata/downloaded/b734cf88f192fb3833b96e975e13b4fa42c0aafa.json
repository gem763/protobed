October 1 is communist China\u2019s \u201cNational Day\u201d which is celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the country this year. Reuters reports that police in Hong Kong predicted a violent attack by protesters:\n\nThere will be a \u201cvery serious violent attack,\u201d the chief superintendent of the police\u2019s public relations branch, Tse Chun-chung, told a news conference on Monday. \u201cWe are on the verge of extreme danger.\u201d Police said they arrested a total of 157 people, including 67 students, after a chaotic weekend in which tear gas and water cannon were fired at protesters who set fires and threw petrol bombs. Eight police officers were injured, they said\u2026 Two prominent democracy activists, actor Gregory Wong and Ventus Lau, were arrested for their involvement in protests on Monday, according to a representative for the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), the organizer of previous mass protests.\n\nCarrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s embattled chief executive, will not be present tomorrow. She decided to spend the day in Bejing but it appears to have been a last-minute change of plans. Reuters says it\u2019s unclear if this was Lam\u2019s decision or if she was \u201csummoned\u201d to China because of the unrest over the weekend.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the kind of thing that happened over the weekend to which mainland China would obviously object:\n\nThere was some violence over the weekend from the police. Here\u2019s an Amnesty international clip mocking the police\u2019s excuse for video showing a cop kicking someone on the ground:\n\nHong Kong police said that this video shows \"what appears to be an officer kicking a yellow object.\" But what is it? \ud83c\udf4c?\ud83d\ude95?\ud83c\udf3b? Nope. It's a human being. pic.twitter.com/KkM4QONoiX \u2014 Amnesty International (@amnesty) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd here\u2019s a clip showing the police pepper-spraying a pro-democracy legislator who didn\u2019t appear to be doing anything except talking:\n\nthe man in the glasses is one of hong kong's finest legislators, eddie chu hoi dick. a social activist who ran in spite of death threats, he was elected with 84,000 votes\u2013more than any candidate that year. here's how hong kong cops treated him today. pic.twitter.com/OH0zrKg1i2 \u2014 wilfred chan (@wilfredchan) September 29, 2019\n\nThere was also some violence from protesters aimed at undercover police:\n\nSeveral undercoverd police officers were assaulted by many #HongKong protesters. One police officer had to make a warning shot to save themselves. pic.twitter.com/wsqHa8AO4m \u2014 Liam Stone\u77f3\u7acb\u5b89 (@liamstone_19) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd also aimed at pro-China protesters:\n\nEarlier tonight protesters in Hong Kong beat up someone who came with a Chinese flag pic.twitter.com/c1zyT76aPI \u2014 Nathan VanderKlippe (@nvanderklippe) September 28, 2019\n\nUltimately, the protesters are fighting for their own long term freedom. This protester says the reeducation camps China is currently using to turn Xinjiang Muslims into eager communists will come to Hong Kong: \u201cXinjiang\u2019s today is Hong Kong\u2019s tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\"The way police are treating Hong Kong people is the same as German Nazis or how China handles Xinjiang. They [Chinese government] put Xinjiang people [Uyghur Muslims] in concentration camps and suppress people who support Muslims.\" pic.twitter.com/JdD9utnuTp \u2014 CJ Werleman (@cjwerleman) September 30, 2019\n\nComparing the Chinese government to the Nazis has become pretty popular among protesters:\n\n\u201cSAY NO TO CHINAZI,\u201d read a silhouetted slogan projected onto the Chinese military\u2019s building in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. The word is a newly popular term in Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement: China + Nazi, a derogatory framing of Beijing\u2019s governance.\n\nSo it\u2019s very possible things will get heated today. If something happens in the next few hours I\u2019ll update this post. Otherwise, we\u2019ll probably write about it tomorrow.", "description": "\"SAY NO TO CHINAZI\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hong-kong-protest.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
