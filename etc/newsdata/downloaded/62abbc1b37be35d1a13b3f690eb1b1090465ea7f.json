An official had deemed her swimsuit not in compliance with national high-school standards that male swimmers cover their buttocks, and female swimmers cover their buttocks and breasts. Another official working at the event told local news that a female referee told her Willis\u2019s suit \u201cwas so far up I could see butt cheek touching butt cheek.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe decision made waves in the community not only because male swimmers are rarely ever scrutinized for their suits, but because Willis is a mixed-race athlete in a predominantly white sport, and was the only swimmer singled out on a team of young women wearing identical suits.\n\n\u201cAll of these girls are all wearing suits that are cut the same way,\u201d Lauren Langford, a swimming coach in the area who worked with Willis when she was younger told the Post. \u201cAnd the only girl who gets disqualified is a mixed-race girl with rounder, curvier features.\u201d She said that \u201csuit wedgies\u201d are common with competitive swimsuits for women, which are cut high, and that the idea that the teen was \u201chiking her suit up on purpose,\u201d as implied by the initial ruling, is ludicrous and offensive.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Willis has been singled out for her body. Last year, a parent \u201ctook a photo of her backside and shared it with other parents to demonstrate that girls on the team were wearing inappropriate swimwear.\u201d And Willis\u2019s mother told local news that at a meet with her younger daughter, also a swimmer, the same referee \u201copenly critiqued her suit\u2019s fit during a meet.\u201d She has also \u201cbeen told by other parents that her three daughters on the team, who are all talented swimmers, need to cover up for the sake of their sons,\u201d she said.\n\nThe state board that decided to return Willis her win said she \u201cwas targeted based solely on how a standard, school-issued uniform happened to fit the shape of her body,\u201d and that the referee\u2019s decision was \u201cheavy-handed and unnecessary.\u201d Before they announced their intent to overturn the referee\u2019s call, Langford said Willis had been \u201ccrushed\u201d by \u201cthe fact that she\u2019s been told she\u2019s intentionally trying to draw this sexual attention.\u201d", "description": "An Alaska school district has reversed an official\u2019s decision to rescind a mixed-race competitive swimmer\u2019s win because of how her bathing suit fit.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/11-swimming-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
