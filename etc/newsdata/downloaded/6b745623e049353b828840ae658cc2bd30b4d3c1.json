Slowly bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. Strain the cream through a sieve, pressing the garlic with the back of a spoon to extract its flavour. Season generously with salt and mix well.\n\nPack the beetroot flat into a roasting dish and pour over the cream. Cover tightly with foil and bake for about one hour, until the beetroot is just tender.\n\nMeanwhile, pulse the bread in a food processor or blender until reduced to coarse crumbs. Add the butter and oil and pulse again until the butter is evenly distributed.\n\nRemove the foil from the roasting dish, then stir in the ground peppercorns and red wine vinegar. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.\n\nCover with the breadcrumbs and return to the oven for 25 minutes or so, until golden brown on top.\n\nVariations:\n\nInstead of the peppercorns and vinegar, add a little freshly grated horseradish or a spoonful from a jar.\n\nStir in some fresh or dried herbs, such as thyme, sage or finely chopped rosemary.\n\nReplace half the beetroot with potato or another root veg.\n\nRecipe from riverford.co.uk", "description": "Beetroot and pink peppercorn gratin A food processor or mandolin will make quick work of the prep, otherwise settle down with a very sharp knife.
