Both Obama and Clinton won re-election, but neither president faced the high degree of personal animus that Trump faces today.\n\nPreviously, the highest share of voters that said they disliked the president personally, regardless of their views on his policies, was 42% for George W. Bush in 2006 \u2014 in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.\n\n49% of those polled said they\u2019re \"very uncomfortable\" with Trump's 2020 candidacy. 41% said were \"very uncomfortable\" with Sen. Bernie Sanders, while 33% said the same for both Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAt the same time, the poll shows that 26% of voters are \"enthusiastic\" about Trump's candidacy \u2014 compared to 17% for Warren, 13% for Sanders and 12% for Biden.\n\nThe bottom line: While the poll suggests a record level of personal hostility toward Trump, it also reflects a polarized electorate that also has doubts about the 3 Democratic frontrunners.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll of 900 voters was conducted Sept. 13-16. The margin of error for all adults is +/- 3.27 percentage points.\n\nGo deeper: Enthusiasm for Elizabeth Warren surges in new 2020 poll", "description": "The rating makes Trump the most disliked president out of his 5 most recent predecessors.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/XuJoa72QVNlP6-rtVkD6ksZxRnY=/470x13:3840x1910/1920x1080/2019/09/22/1569170430398.None", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
