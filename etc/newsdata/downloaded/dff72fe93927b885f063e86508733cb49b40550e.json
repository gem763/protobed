We said \u2018yes\u2019 and then had to start taking them down. They were in a \u00adlittle box room so there wasn\u2019t much space.\n\n\u201cThe seller said she would take Molly downstairs so she wouldn\u2019t get in the way and we were fine with that.\n\n\u201cBut we were none-the-wiser she had a dog at that stage. They went down to get a drink and a few minutes later she came back up, leaving Molly downstairs. Within two minutes we heard a scream.\n\n\u201cWe raced downstairs and found Molly with her face ripped open. It was \u00adcompletely chewed, I just went numb. There\u2019s a difference between a nip and a serious bite.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday People)\n\n\u201cIt pierced right through her cheek.\n\n\u201cI was in shock, I said \u2018we need to call an ambulance\u2019, I had to say it four times, but she seemed reluctant.\n\n\u201cShe was saying \u2018my poor Milo\u2019, then \u2018he doesn\u2019t know what\n\nhe\u2019s done\u2019.\u201d\n\nAfter a call to 999, police \u00adarrived at the house in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, and advised driving Molly to \u00adhospital as it would be quicker than waiting for an ambulance.\n\nCharmaine went on: \u201cAt the hospital they gave us the option of a local \u00adanaesthetic and putting her under for an operation, it was awful. In the end she had the anaesthetic and needed 36 \u00adstitches. It took 45 minutes to stitch her up. We didn\u2019t get home until 3am.\n\n\u201cMolly will always have a scar. The surgeon told us we had to prosecute because it was a serious dog bite.\u201d\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday People)\n\nMarsh appeared at Cheltenham \u00admagistrates court last month charged with being the owner of a dog dangerously out of control. She was found guilty and ordered to keep the dog under control or it would be destroyed.\n\nShe must also keep the dog muzzled on walks and cannot leave it alone with a child under 17. Marsh was also given a \u00adcommunity order to do 60 hours\u2019 unpaid work.\n\nCharmaine said: \u201cI want to warn people this is a \u00addangerous dog.\n\n\"We didn\u2019t know there was a dog in the house. My daughter had her face chewed, but this woman seemed to care more about her pet than the fact my daughter is scarred for life.\n\n(Image: Steve Bainbridge/Sunday People)\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want the dog to be \u00addestroyed, but she needs to keep it \u00admuzzled, especially around children. Parents need to be aware a dog can snap at any time.\u201d\n\nMarsh, meanwhile, vowed to abide by the court order. She said: \u201cI am totally distraught and it has affected me deeply that a little girl was hurt in my home.\n\n\"I have taken it on board and am obeying everything the court has ordered.\u201d\n\nA source added: \u201cShe has not walked Milo without a muzzle.\n\n\u201cShe understands the implications.\u201d\n\nMolly\u2019s ordeal emerged as Mary Rollinson, 73, \u00adcontinues to \u00adrecover after a pit bull dragged her into a pond in Yeadon, Leeds, bit off part of a finger and caused horrific wounds.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Youngster Molly Beresford will be scarred for life after being bitten on the face by Staffy crossbreed", "authors": ["Phil Cardy", "Image", "Steve Bainbridge Sunday People"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653811.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SMX_SB_Beresford_12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
