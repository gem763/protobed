Williams suspended 2 games", "language": "en", "text": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Saints defensive back P.J. Williams has been suspended two games for a violation of the NFL\u2019s substance abuse policy.\n\nThe league said in a statement Tuesday that Williams is suspended immediately and will be available to return to the Saints after the club\u2019s Week 8 game against Arizona.\n\nThe statement does not specify which banned substance Williams was determined to have used. However, Williams was arrested in January for allegedly driving while intoxicated just days after the Saints\u2019 loss in the NFC Championship game. He pleaded guilty in August to reckless operation of a vehicle.\n\nNew Orleans made Williams a third-round draft choice out of Florida State in 2015, but he missed most of his first two seasons because of injuries. He has played in all but one game since 2017 and has three career interceptions with one returned for a touchdown.\n\nThis season, Williams has seven solo or assisted tackles combined and has broken up two passes.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saints defensive back P.J.
