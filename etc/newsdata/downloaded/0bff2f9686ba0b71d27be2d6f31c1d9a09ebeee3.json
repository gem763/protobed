NO!\n\nThe price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the simplest, most popular and probably most intuitive way to measure value in the stock market. You calculate it by taking the price of the stock market and divide it by 12 months\u2019 worth of earnings. If the P/E is above some long term average, the market is arguably expensive.\n\nCurrently, the S&P 500 is trading at a forward P/E \u2013 which is calculated based on next-12 month earnings \u2013 of around 16.6. According to Factset, this is higher than the five-year average of 16.5 and the 10-year average of 14.8. In other words, the market looks like it\u2019s just above fair valued.\n\nBut, who knows what that means for the near term? For folks who follow the market closely (or read Yahoo Finance regularly), it\u2019s not news that a low P/E doesn\u2019t mean stocks will go up right away or that a high P/E doesn\u2019t mean stocks will drop soon. (And to be clear, stocks don\u2019t have to fall to get cheaper. That\u2019s math.)\n\nIn fact, the P/E statistically tells you almost nothing about what\u2019s gonna happen in the next year in the market.\n\nThe long term picture, however, is much different.\n\nStock market multiples become more predictive the more time you give them. More\n\n\u201cOur work suggests that while the valuation of the S&P 500 may not explain returns over the next year or two, over the next 10 years, the Price to Normalized earnings ratio of the S&P 500 has explained ~80% of the variability of market returns,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s Savita Subramanian said in a recent note to clients.\n\n\u201cBased on a historical regression, using today\u2019s price to normalized earnings ratio yields an expected annual price return of 6% for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd with that modest 6% annual return over 10 years, assuming history repeats, you get to about 5300 on the S&P 500.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
