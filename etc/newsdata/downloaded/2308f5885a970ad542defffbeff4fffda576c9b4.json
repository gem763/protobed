Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 29, 2019\n\nTrump did not provide the individual\u2019s name, but reports surfaced late Monday that ISIS spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, who was considered a likely successor to al-Baghdadi, had been killed in a U.S. airstrike.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House, Pentagon and State Department for more information.\n\nTrump announced al-Baghdadi\u2019s death in an address from the White House on Sunday, describing in detail a U.S. military raid in northwest Syria. Trump said U.S. forces had trapped Baghdadi at the end of a tunnel, after which he detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children.\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s death represented a major symbolic victory in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, though officials have emphasized the need to continue to focus on delivering ISIS a lasting defeat, including by denying it financial resources in the region.\n\nTrump told reporters Sunday that he had been briefed on potential al-Baghdadi\u2019s potential successors.\n\n\u201cWe know the successors. And we've already got them in our sights,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe successful operation against al-Baghdadi came as Trump faced continued scrutiny for his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria. Many have warned that doing so could result in a resurgence on ISIS in the region.\n\nTrump has stood by his plans to pull back U.S. forces but has left some behind in order to guard oil fields to, partly to prevent ISIS from gaining control of them.", "description": "President Trump said Tuesday that U.S. forces had killed the \u201cnumber one replacement\u201d for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, days after al-Baghdadij was killed in a U.S. military raid in Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/abubakral-baghdadi_1026719getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
