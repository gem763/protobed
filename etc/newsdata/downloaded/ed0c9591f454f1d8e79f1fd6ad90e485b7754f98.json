The coaches and activity sponsors said they personally would call police for \u201cvery serious\u201d incidents, such as child sexual abuse, but would report those viewed as less serious to school administrators.\n\nBefore the Damascus attack, some coaches were not always present while players used locker rooms and team rooms, or did not consistently lock the facilities when they were not being used, the report said.\n\nThe examination noted a previous instance of alleged misconduct by football players, at Seneca Valley High School \u2014 reported by The Washington Post \u2014 and vaguely referred to other incidents in athletics and extracurricular activities but gave no detail, saying those matters were \u201crelatively minor and were quickly and appropriately addressed.\u201d\n\n[Hazing incident reported at another Maryland high school, officials say]\n\nAt Damascus High, the incident left a football-proud community reeling and raised broader questions districtwide about how students are supervised and how incidents are reported to police.\n\nThe Post reported that the school waited more than 12 hours to bring in law enforcement and launched its own in-house investigation first.\n\n[A football locker room, a broomstick and a sex assault case roil a school]\n\nNo coaches were in the locker room over a 25-minute stretch before practice, school officials have said, during which the relatively brief but violent attacks unfolded. All of the students involved were 14 or 15 years old at the time.\n\nIn November, four of the players were each charged as adults with one count of first-degree rape and three counts of attempted, first-degree rape, according to court records. The cases were later transferred to juvenile court, where each teen pleaded to being involved in the attacks, according to court hearings held largely behind closed doors in Montgomery County.\n\nBecause the juvenile hearings were not open for the full proceedings, the exact role each student played remains unclear, as does the punishment or rehabilitation recommendations each received.\n\nThe report released Monday said the school system had generally fostered a positive culture around athletics and extracurricular activities, but it also noted that administrators and coaches set the tone.\n\nIt pointed to a \u201csupervision gap\u201d between the end of the school day and the beginning of sports practice, when a junior varsity or freshman team may have to wait for its turn on a field or court. Many students don\u2019t have the means to go home and come back to school again. Supervision often falls on building services staff, it said.\n\nRecent efforts to require coaches and sponsors to file written supervision plans have had \u201cmixed results,\u201d the study found, with variations in quality and complaints about feeling forced to craft plans that are unrealistic, given resource limitations.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Montgomery County schools Superintendent Jack Smith said the analysis marked a step forward.\n\n\u201cWith all the work our external reviewers did, we have lots of things to think about and work on in our system,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith noted in a letter to the community Monday that the school system had already taken steps to improve and launched a student-athlete leadership council. In the next year, the district hopes to work with a national organization to become a leader in best practices in after-school safety and supervision, he said.\n\n[Damascus High returns to football field, a year after sexual assault case consumed town]\n\nThomas M. DeGonia, an attorney representing the family of one of the victims, questioned the significance and breadth of the report.\n\n\u201cThe school system is now saying there is currently no widespread culture of these kinds of problems,\u201d DeGonia said. \u201cWell, OK, but everyone has been talking about this for a year. What\u2019s not answered is how did things at Damascus devolve to the point where there was a brutal sexual assault in a locker room by several players who didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it?\u201d\n\nDeGonia called on the school system to be more transparent about what it discovered and what problems existed. That is part of what the public wants to know, the attorney said.\n\n\u201cWhat were the risks and dangers in October 2018 \u2014 at Damascus and anywhere else in the county?\u201d DeGonia said.\n\nThe report looked at best practices and issued recommendations, including considering more security staffing after school or supervised spaces such as a study hall or media center. It urged improvements to training for administrators and coaches, and in programming for student athletes and extracurricular participants.\n\nIt said that while students know how to identify and respond to bullying, they have less awareness about hazing.\n\n\u201cThis is partly due to the fact that a fine line separates innocuous bonding rituals and hazing; benign traditions can escalate quickly,\u201d it said. \u201cBecause students did not have a clear definition of hazing, we also found that they were not sure how they would respond to it or if they should report such incidents.\u201d\n\nThe report, which cost $250,000, was based on 29 interviews \u2014 with administrators, school staff members, coaches, parents and sponsors \u2014 along with student and staff focus-group discussions and a review of documents related to the Damascus attack, state and federal laws, and school system policies.\n\nThe law firm also examined school system reports on serious incidents, bullying and student discipline for the last four years at Damascus and four other high schools \u2014 Seneca Valley, Montgomery Blair, Walt Whitman and Walter Johnson.\n\n[Outside investigation of Damascus High sexual assault case takes longer than expected]\n\nThe release of the report comes as a separate inquiry by prosecutors is expected to be complete in 30 to 60 days, according to Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney John McCarthy. That office has reviewed years of school system records and is examining whether earlier episodes unfolded at Damascus High similar to what happened last fall.\n\nSchool officials also did their own personnel investigation, related to the Oct. 31 incident. A junior varsity coach and the athletic director at Damascus High no longer work for the school system. The principal moved into a central-office position, and the varsity coach remains in place.\n\nRead more:\n\nDamascus High returns to football field, a year after sexual assault case consumed town\n\nParents angered by alleged locker room sex assault demand answers from officials\n\nFootball locker room was unsupervised during alleged broomstick attack\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Montgomery County students don\u2019t have a good sense of what constitutes hazing, study finds.", "authors": ["Donna St. George", "Reporter Covering Education", "Dan Morse", "Reporter Covering Courts", "Crime In Montgomery County", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/imxelFJUfO4WmyOVCYsnCYfovGI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7XXBMLV7XII6TJOGDZ2PP3CKSM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
