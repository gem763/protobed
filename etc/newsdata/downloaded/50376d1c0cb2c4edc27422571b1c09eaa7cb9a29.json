The Jaguars\u2019 owner said he didn\u2019t want to trade Ramsey, arguably the best cornerback in the NFL, but perhaps the Jaguars felt forced into a move when Ramsey missed multiple games with a curiously timed back injury.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Rams acquired Ramsey in a trade this week for a hefty price, but they\u2019re clearly getting one of the NFL\u2019s most talented players. And it sounds like they\u2019re getting a happy player too.\n\nJalen Ramsey feels \u2018free\u2019\n\nIn an interview with Rams\u2019 in-house reporter Sarina Morales, Ramsey said he is \u201csuper excited\u201d to be a part of the Rams.\n\n\u201cI just feel free,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cI feel free. I feel like I can be myself. A fresh start with a team who values who I am, obviously, with what they gave up to get me. And I truly respect that. I\u2019m ready to do what I can to help this team win.\u201d\n\nRamsey is outspoken, and that\u2019s not going to be a good fit with every team. As Yahoo Sports\u2019 Charles Robinson wrote, trading Ramsey was practically choosing vice president of football operations Tom Coughlin over Ramsey and not shaking up the front office for one player. Ramsey once famously attacked just about every quarterback, including calling Rams quarterback Jared Goff \u201caverage to above average.\u201d\n\n\"In relation to what he was calling a lot of people, that wasn\u2019t half bad,\u201d Goff said, according to ESPN.com\u2019s Lindsey Thiry.\n\nHopefully for the Rams, Ramsey\u2019s swagger will fit right in.\n\n\u201cThe best corner in the NFL,\u201d Ramsey told Morales when she asked what the Rams were getting. \u201cThe best corner in the NFL for years and years and years to come.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTaco bout an exciting \ud83c\udf2e Tuesday! @jalenramsey on the last few days, what he brings to the team + more! pic.twitter.com/AjAphurtIN \u2014 Los Angeles Rams (@RamsNFL) October 17, 2019\n\nWill Ramsey play on Sunday?\n\nNow, for the back injury. Just because Ramsey\u2019s back injury came shortly after his trade demand doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a legitimate injury.\n\nRams coach Sean McVay said he hopes Ramsey can play Sunday at the Atlanta Falcons.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to be able to do that, but we\u2019ll be smart about it,\u201d McVay said, via ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter.\n\nThiry reported Ramsey was expected to participate in the Rams\u2019 practice on Thursday.\n\nIf Ramsey plays on Sunday, there will be some angry folks in Jacksonville. But Ramsey\u2019s Jaguars days are officially in his past.\n\nCornerback Jalen Ramsey could make his Rams debut on Sunday.
