One week later the remains were positively identified as belonging to Mr Moldt.\n\nMr Moldt's sunken car was spotted by a previous resident of the area after \"doing a Google search\", police said.\n\nThe man then contacted a current resident of Moon Bay Circle to tell them what he had seen. Using his personal drone, the current resident confirmed there was a car in the pond and contacted police.\n\nA report by the Charley Project, an online database of cold cases in the US, said the \"vehicle had plainly [been] visible on a Google Earth satellite photo of the area since 2007, but apparently no-one had noticed it until 2019\".\n\nImage copyright Google Maps\n\nImage copyright Google Maps\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff's Office told the BBC that Mr Moldt is presumed to have lost control of his vehicle and driven into the pond.\n\nThe force said that, during the initial investigation into his disappearance, there was \"no evidence of that occurring\" until recently, when a shift in the water made the car visible.\n\n\"You can't determine what happened that many years ago, what transpired,\" police spokeswoman Therese Barbera said.\n\n\"All we know is that he went missing off the face of the Earth, and now he's been discovered.\"\n\nMs Barbera said it was a neighbour who reported the sunken car and was not aware of reports that Google Maps had been used.\n\nOn the night of his disappearance, Mr Moldt left the club at about 23:00 local time (03:00 GMT), a report by the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System said.\n\nMr Moldt, a quiet man who did not socialise much, did not appear intoxicated and left alone in his vehicle, it added.\n\n\"He also was not a frequent drinker but did have several drinks at the bar,\" the report said.\n\nMr Moldt called his girlfriend at about 21:30, telling her he would be home soon, but was never seen or heard from again.\n\nMr Moldt's family has been informed about the discovery of his remains.", "description": "William Moldt went missing in mysterious circumstances 22 years ago after a night out in Florida.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5128/production/_108767702_7448_47243.jpg"}
