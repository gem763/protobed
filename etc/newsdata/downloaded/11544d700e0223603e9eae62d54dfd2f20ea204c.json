One caller on Friday asked about Teradyne (TER) : \"This is a really good stock. I like semiconductors,\" said Cramer.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of TER, below, we can see that TER has been in a nice uptrend from late December. Prices are trading above the rising 50-day moving average line as well as the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rising the past 12 months and this supports the advance as buyers of TER have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has been in a bullish configuration most of the time since June.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of TER, below, we can see a mostly bullish set up. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is positive but it has not moved up to a new high like prices have in the past two months. This is a small divergence and could it could change quickly if the line makes a new high.\n\nThe MACD oscillator has been bullish since March.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TER, below, we can see an uptrend and the projection of a $65 price target to start.\n\nBottom line strategy: Cramer likes the stock and the charts are constructive. Traders could go long TER at current levels risking below $56 while targeting $65 initially.", "description": "Let's take a few minutes to add the charts to the Cramer's analysis....TER", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Teradyne Could Continue To Rally So Go Long Here", "Let'S Take A Few Minutes To Add The Charts To The Cramer'S Analysis.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Eric Jhonsa", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/127912c7-1fef-11e9-afa9-91ed118e75be.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
