AP photographer Joe Rosenthal's iconic photo became one of the most enduring ever taken of war. This is the story behind it. (Feb. 23) AP\n\nAnother Marine photographed in the iconic photograph of six men raising a United States flag over Iwo Jima has been misidentified, admitted Marine Corps officials Thursday.\n\nThe Marine Corps announced that Cpl. Harold \"Pie\" Keller was one of the men in the photograph, a development that comes 74 years after the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph was taken on Mt. Suribachi by Joe Rosenthal, an Associated Press photographer.\n\nOriginally, the man identified on the far side of the flag pole was Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon \u2014 a miscalculation caused, in part, due to his helmet only being visible in the shot.\n\nAfter private historians identified by NBC News as Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer \"asserted that there was an error in identifying the Marines depicted,\" per a statement from the Marine Corps, the Marine Corps formed a board with assistance from the FBI to investigate the identity of the man photographed.\n\nIn this Feb 23, 1945 file photo, U.S. Marines of the 28th Regiment, 5th Division, raise the American flag atop Mt. Suribachi, Iwo Jima, Japan. (Photo: Joe Rosenthal, AP)\n\n\"Without the initiative and contributions of both private historians devoted to preservation of our history and the FBI\u2019s support, the Marine Corps would not have this opportunity to expand on the historical record of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi,\" wrote the Marine Corps in a statement. \"We are extremely grateful for their dedication to helping us preserve our legacy.\"\n\nThe correction comes more than three years after the Marine Corps announced that they had misidentified Pvt. 1st Class Harold Schultz, a Purple Heart recipient who went on to work for the U.S. Postal Service after being injured on Iwo Jima.\n\nLike Schultz, Keller was private about his time in World War II.\n\n\u201cWe knew he fought in the war, we knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point,\" Keller's daughter, Kay Maurer, told NBC News. \"But he didn\u2019t tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.\u201d\n\nRegardless of who was memorialized in Rosenthal's photograph, the Marine Corps said in a statement that \"each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps\u2019 cherished history.\"\n\nKeller, a Purple Heart awardee, died in 1979, at the age of 57. According to his obituary, he was a former fire chief and a member of the Brooklyn, Iowa Fire Department for three decades.\n\nHe is buried in Brooklyn Memorial Cemetery in his hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa.\n\nFollow Joshua Bote and Adrianna Rodriguezon Twitter: @joshua_bote and @AdriannaUSAT\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/17/marine-corps-misidentifies-wwii-hero-iconic-iwo-jima-flag-photo/4006332002/", "description": "Three historians using film footage from Mount Suribachi identified one of the six flag-raisers as Cpl.
