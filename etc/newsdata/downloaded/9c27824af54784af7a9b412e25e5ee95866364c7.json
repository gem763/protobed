Over one week this summer, three journalists in Mexico were assassinated. Since 2000, 153 journalists have been killed in the country.\n\nThe deeply macabre hanging of nine corpses from a bridge in the city of Uruapan in August is a reminder there has been no let up in cartel orchestrated killings. Last year was the bloodiest year yet in the Mexican crime war. Despite the hopes following the election of an anti-corruption, socialist president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (known as \u2018AMLO\u2019), the death toll rose to more than 30,000 in 2018.\n\nSince its dawn in the early 2000s, the war has now taken the lives of almost 200,000 Mexicans, most of the victims from ordinary working class families, caught at the wrong place at the wrong time. It has been fueled by billions of dollars in annual revenue for the cartels, and by waves of firearms spilling south over the U.S. border.\n\nTo better understand the complexities of the Mexican crime war, VICE sat down with narco-journalist Ioan Grillo. Grillo has covered the war since the kindling was lit two decades ago, covering the conflict for Time Magazine and The New York Times. He also wrote two critically acclaimed books.\n\nOver many cups of coffee, Grillo attempted to explain the bewildering nature of this war: its major players, where the money goes, how he copes with risks and what might be done to quell the violence.\n\nVICE: Can you outline the main players in Mexico\u2019s cartel wars?\n\nIoan Grillo: Right now you\u2019ve got a lot of fragmentation. You\u2019ve got the Sinaloa, the oldest and most infamous cartel, run by Chapo Guzman and his sons (\u2018Los Chapitos\u2019), and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, based out of Guadalajara. Then there\u2019s Los Zetas, the first paramilitary cartel, who have now split into factions; and the Gulf Cartel in Tamaulipas and Veracruz; the Juarez Cartel; and the Tijuana Cartel. Then we come to the smaller cartels, the cartelitos: the Guerreros Unidos, Los Rojos, Los Caballeros Templarios, and La Familia Michoac\u00e1n. There are dozens of these.\n\nHow wide are their operations?\n\nOh, they are worldwide. The largest cartels have envoys everywhere. There\u2019s a big presence in the U.S., the Caribbean, and South America, but they are also active in Britain, mainland Europe, China, even Russia.\n\nHow did the cartels seize the control we see them exercising today?\n\nThere\u2019s no single watershed moment, but the breakdown of the PRI\u2019s (Institutional Revolutionary Party) one party rule was a big factor as it fractured communication between municipal police forces. What was a stable system of top-down, endemic corruption suddenly became an unstable system of bottom-up, endemic corruption.\n\nAnother factor was the re-routing of the cocaine as it came into the U.S. After Reagan clamped down on the Caribbean route into Miami, cocaine started to stream through central America into Mexico, which became the final strait. After that the cartels began purchasing the cocaine directly from the Colombians at the border and selling it on. Before that, cartels were known as \u2018plazas,' headed by plaza bosses and operating more locally\u2014usually paid off with a cut of the drugs they were trafficking. Then, with more money came more violence for control of that money.\n\nIs it just about cocaine and other drugs, or are there other significant revenues?\n\nConcerning narcotics, there are five main products. The first is marijuana, a big cash crop. It\u2019s inexpensive to manufacture and fetches a decent profit margin. However, legalization in the U.S. is damaging its reach. The second is cocaine, [which is] traditionally most profitable. A kilo of pure cocaine can be bought by cartels at the border for as little as $2,000 and sold for a huge markup. Then there\u2019s heroin, which is now largely cultivated in Mexico. If you buy a wrap of heroin in Baltimore today, chances are it\u2019s made in Mexico. Fourth, there\u2019s methamphetamine, which ripped through Mexico after the 2005 Combat Methamphetamine Act in the U.S. And recently we\u2019ve been seeing fentanyl being made in Mexico. This is a seriously dangerous opioid, responsible for tens of thousands of overdose deaths.\n\nHowever, on top of the drugs, there\u2019s anything and everything else. Stealing crude oil is big business for oil racketeers known as huachicoleros, and other revenue comes from capturing agricultural plantations\u2014avocados and limes, illegal iron mining, illegal logging. And there are the repugnant practices of people-smuggling and people trafficking.\n\nDo you know how much overall revenue comes from all of this? And where it goes?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know. However, the Rand Drug Policy Research Center estimated the U.S. spends $150 billion per year on illegal drugs. Obviously much of that will not get to Mexico, as the biggest markups come from the street-selling level. Some of this money goes towards material wealth for the cartels and their lieutenants. But an enormous amount is laundered via U.S. banks, particularly in Texas, and through tax havens like Panama. Money is also laundered through real estate and shell companies all over the world.\n\nCan you describe the process in which people get involved with the cartels?\n\nIt starts with an absence of government, an absence of wealth, and an absence of family. With these three things, and the pull of easy money from (at first) petty crime, kids get involved. It usually starts with street gangs, then kids will be given a phone, a $50 weekly salary and told to stand guard on the corner as a kind of sentry, a halc\u00f3n, before they\u2019re moved to higher forms of crime, be it moving drugs or la sicariato (hitmen). And then the police are an active arm of the cartels in many areas.\n\nWhen you investigate in these dangerous areas, do you tell people you\u2019re a journalist?\n\nYes, always. I don\u2019t want anyone to think I\u2019m working for a rival cartel, or the DEA. But reporting on organized crime can offer a strange protection. If I\u2019m interviewing the head of the Red Command in Rio, no one is going to hold me up because they know I\u2019m \"with them.\" They also don\u2019t want the trouble of robbing some gringo and having the whole police force roll up, guns blazing.\n\nBut journalists are targeted by the cartels in Mexico?\n\nIt\u2019s usually for a specific, terrifyingly petty reason. Sometimes it\u2019s for publishing something they don\u2019t like. A coworker of mine was killed for publishing an op-ed by a grieving mother which called the cartels cowards. It can also be for not covering a story they want you to cover, such as an example murder. A Juarez newspaper once published a chilling headline, directed towards the cartels, titled \u2018\u00bfQu\u00e9 quiere de nosotros?\u2019 (What do you want from us?)\n\nI\u2019m sure many newspapers back off. Are there any you respect for not doing so?\n\nYes, many. El R\u00edodoce in Sinaloa for example, after my friend Javier Valdez was killed in 2017.\n\nWhen have you felt most in danger?\n\nThere was one time in Michoac\u00e1n, when cartel members dressed as Autodefensas thought I was a DEA agent and threatened me with a grenade. Another in Tabasco when the Jalisco Cartel told me they were going to raid my hotel for potential ransom victims. Another when I managed to pull over just a few miles before a cartel roadblock in Coahuila. The list goes on...\n\nIf you were to offer a child in Sinaloa a Chapo or a Che Guevara belt buckle, which would they choose?\n\nOh, Chapo every time. But the question of ideology is a pertinent one. While many cartels don\u2019t have a political ideology, they do have strange rituals. For instance, Los Zetas take the U.S. Marines\u2019 philosophy of \"never leave a man behind\" to new levels\u2014\"never leave the dead behind\"\u2014and steal back their fallen brothers from morgues. Many cartel leaders, such as Nazario Moreno, are quasi-religious, or suffer from a type of Jerusalem Syndrome in which they think themselves gods. There\u2019s also a Robin Hood angle\u2014standing up for the little man and the poor\u2014which is celebrated by the narcocorridos.\n\nOkay, I\u2019m giving you a magic wand. How would you attempt to solve the narco problem?\n\nFirst, drug policy reform. We need to accept drug policy is failing. It should be about reducing the tens of billions of dollars that go to criminals. There\u2019s two areas of tragedy: the people dying of overdoses, and the criminals being funded to slaughter each other, as well as their fellow citizens. With drugs that are problematic to legalize, such as heroin, you need rehabilitation, because both the money and the overdose deaths are about addiction. Other drugs, such as cocaine, which are taken more casually, I would consider decriminalizing or even legalizing. Certainly, I think marijuana should be legalized.\n\nSecondly, you have to fight for the hearts and minds of the young people who are recruited into cartels. Society needs to offer something to these children, with funding for social work. Wealth inequality also breeds crime. It\u2019s only after areas are ghettoized that cartels have room to breathe.\n\nThirdly, how do you build a police force that\u2019s trusted? It\u2019s very hard to find a blueprint for this. Nicaragua, despite its poverty, is supposed to have a police force that\u2019s resistant to the insurgency of gangs, particularly in areas where they fought the Contras, but trust has been undermined recently. Cuba has a lot less crime than its neighbors but it\u2019s a fairly authoritarian society. Countries like Chile, too, but I\u2019d put that down to per-capita wealth.\n\nWould you halt the flow of guns into Mexico from the U.S.?\n\nI would try. Most of the guns used by the cartels are purchased in the U.S. I don\u2019t see banning guns in the U.S. as realistic, but there are many other steps you can take. We need to reduce the number of guns coming into Mexico.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion, so far, on Obrador\u2019s presidency?\n\nWhen he was elected there was a moment of hope for change. It was the biggest win for a president in years. However, his first eight months have been disappointing. You\u2019ve had an increase in violence and a flat economy. You can\u2019t pin this all on AMLO\u2019s presidency because these things are eternally complex and can\u2019t be solved overnight, but his strategies haven\u2019t been clear, nor successful.\n\nFinally, are you optimistic for the future?\n\nI really can\u2019t say. It\u2019s not my job to be optimistic.\n\nA version of this article originally appeared in Mexico News Daily.", "description": "Journalist Ioan Grillo gives unique insight into the risks and complexities of the Mexican drug war.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d947b631b545200080b61d0/lede/1570012282692-RMR_0043-October-05-2015-i-grillo-003-2.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8426xh;0xw,0.0815xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
