Peterson said he did not intend for his message to be racist, but wanted the \"guys cleaned up.\"\n\n\"I was just disgruntled about some of the hairdos that we're seeing. You think of Penn State as a bunch of clean-cut guys. And you do see so many who are clean cut. But the tattoos and the hair \u2014 there are a lot of guys with hair coming down their backs and it just looks awful. And it's the same for the NFL and NBA, too,\" he told the paper.\n\nHair-based discrimination against styles like dreadlocks and braids can target African Americans communities, where such hairstyles have cultural importance and historical significance. Because of this, cutting someone's dreadlocks can perpetuate harmful and racist stereotypes about hair while also determining what some see as a \"professional\" haircut.\n\nRead more: A middle school student who was bullied for her Afro promised to return to school 'bigger and better' in an inspirational video\n\nPenn State rallied around Sutherland in support\n\nRegardless of Peterson's message, the Penn State community was quick to rally around Sutherland.\n\n\"While we don't know the source of this letter or the authenticity, obviously its content does not align with our values. We strongly condemn this message or any message of intolerance,\" Penn State said in a Tweet about the letter.\n\nFootball head coach James Franklin also offered a defense of Sutherland.\n\n\"Jonathan Sutherland is one of the most respected players in our program,\" Franklin said at a news conference. \"He's the ultimate example of what our program is all about. He's a captain, he's a dean's list honor student, he's confident, he's articulate, he's intelligent, he's thoughtful, he's caring, and he's committed.\n\n\"He's got two of the most supportive parents, and I would be so blessed if my daughters would marry someone with his character and integrity one day.\"\n\nFranklin said at the press conference that football \"brings people together.\"\n\n\"The football that I know and love brings people together and embraces differences \u2013 black, white, brown, Catholic, Jewish or Muslim, rich or poor, rural or urban, Republican or Democrat. Long hair, short hair, no hair, they're all in that locker room together,\" the head coach said. \"Teams all over this country are the purest form of humanity that we have. We don't judge, we embrace differences. We live. We learn. We grow. We support and we defend each other. We're a family.\"", "description": "Pennsylvania State University safety Jonathan Sutherland received a letter from an alumnus from Penn State who was critical of his appearance.", "authors": ["Kelly Mclaughlin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e38ece94e8642494b7e91?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
