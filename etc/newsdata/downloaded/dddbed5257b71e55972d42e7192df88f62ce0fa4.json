In China, foreigners are required to hold a bachelor degree to obtain a work visa, though the rules are not widely enforced.\n\nCrowdfunding pages for Petersen and Harlan posted on a China Horizons\u2019 social media site note that they helped U.S. college students acquire visas to teach English in China.\n\n\u201cBecause of increasing political and economic problems between the U.S. and China, we are no longer able to send teachers to China safely,\u201d said the company in a social media post, adding that it planned to close the business by the end of October.", "description": "(Corrects spelling of formerly detained U.S. citizen's name to Petersen, not Peterson, in paragraph 2 and 8)", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
