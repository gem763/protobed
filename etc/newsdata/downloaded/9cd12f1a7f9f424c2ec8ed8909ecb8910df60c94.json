Welcome back to the Premier League.\n\nThis had all the elements of an exciting, enthralling clash between two sides grateful to be in the top flight but that made the scrap for the points all the more entertaining.\n\nThere was barely a moment when there wasn\u2019t something to debate or analyse. Between Adam Webster\u2019s opener for Brighton in the 21st minute and Matt Targett\u2019s late winner for Villa.\n\nMatt Targett scored the winner in the final minute of stoppage time to break Brighton hearts\n\nFor it had just about everything else along with Aaron Mooy\u2019s crazy five-minute spell where he was shown two yellow cards to Conor Hourihane\u2019s strike being ruled out by the officials at Stockley Park before Jack Grealish\u2019s effort ahead of half-time was given the green light. Then throw in Villa\u2019s rather desperate penalty appeal after John McGinn\u2019s shot had clearly rebounded off the back of Shane Duffy minutes before Targett struck.\n\nIn the end, Dean Smith punched the air as the home supporters celebrated. Graham Potter stuck out a hand for Smith to shake and then walked to his players to comfort them. This will sting.\n\nFor Villa, on the back of that thumping 5-1 win over Norwich, this was what they had craved - a late win at Villa Park. Grealish and Tyrone Mings soaked up the applause after full-time after the focus pre-match had fallen on the England central defender.\n\nAdam Webster gave Brighton the lead with a header from Pascal Gross' free-kick\n\nAn hour before the whistle was blown at 3pm, Villa fans cheered his name when it was read out on the tannoy. Then, five minutes before the start, a banner of Mings in an England shirt with the word \u2018PROUD\u2019 at the bottom was held up at the front of the North Stand.\n\nSeconds before referee David Coote blew to start the match, Mings\u2019s name was announced again and for the second time he was given a standing ovation. It was a brilliant gesture after the central defender was racially abused during his senior debut for England in the European Championship qualifier against Bulgaria last Monday.\n\nThe support helped to build an atmosphere and Villa were positive from the off. Early exchanges between Grealish and McGinn opened up space for lone striker Wesley and gave him a chance to test Brighton captain Lewis Dunk, who was alongside Webster as opposed to his long-term partner Duffy, who was on the bench.\n\nIt was the centre back's first goal for Brighton as the visitors capitalised on a good start\n\nSmith had spoken of his players not exactly needing a break after their 5-1 demolition of Norwich two weeks ago, but his captain made the most of his few days of downtime. Grealish flew to Switzerland where he stayed in the aptly named Hotel Villa Honegg.\n\nThe break seemed to do him good. He looked refreshed and ready to go. Inside 10 minutes, he controlled the ball in his own half, broke forward and ran towards the Brighton penalty area after skipping past Dale Stephens. After briefly looking up and assessing his options, he played a pass out to the right for Frederic Guilbert.\n\nGuilbert didn\u2019t rush his pass but eventually fizzed it into the six-yard area. Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan fumbled the ball, conceding possession but Wesley, who sprinted back to retrieve it, could only find defender Martin Montoya who cleared.\n\nStill, it was a positive sign and something for Villa to build on if only they could stay sharp and alert in defence.\n\nHowever, Brighton went down to 10 men after Aaron Mooy was sent off for a second yellow\n\nUnfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. After Conor Hourihane was perhaps harshly booked for a foul on Montoya, Brighton were awarded a free-kick 30 yards from Villa\u2019s goal. Mooy ran over the ball, Pascal Gross delivered, Mings lost failed to track the cross and Webster headed into the far corner.\n\nBut it wouldn\u2019t be long before Villa would find a way back into the game. It was a five-minute spell that Mooy will want to forget. First, the Australian kicked the ball away after Coote had awarded Villa a free-kick. If that wasn\u2019t daft enough then clattering into the back of Grealish was scratch your head sort of stuff. Off he went and Villa looked lively.\n\nMooy made two challenges deemed to be bookable offences within five minutes of each other\n\nThe drama didn't end there as Conor Hourihane had a goal controversial ruled out by VAR\n\nThe goal was chalked off as Wesley was deemed to have infringed goalkeeper Mat Ryan\n\nJack Grealish however did eventually level things up in added time at the end of the first half\n\nThe goal just before the break was Grealish's first Premier League goal at Villa Park\n\nTyrone Mings played his first game since suffering racist abuse on England duty in Bulgaria\n\nNeal Maupay (right) was a threat despite Brighton's numerical disadvantage\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate and U21s manager Aidy Boothroyd were in attendance\n\nAnwar El Ghazi (right) should have put Villa ahead but missed two glorious opportunities\n\nMcGinn, who scored a hat-trick for Scotland against San Marino during the two-week break, was as sharp as ever, but there was nothing he could do as he watched his shot, which appeared destined for the bottom corner, come off Wesley and away from goal. Frustrating, but two minutes before half-time, Villa had the ball in the net. Hourihane drove McGinn\u2019s cutback into the bottom corner. Villa Park erupted but cheers quickly changed to boos as it became apparent that Wesley\u2019s obstruction of Ryan had been spotted by VAR.\n\nJohn McGinn also spurned another Villa opportunity after more brilliance from Grealish\n\nIt was probably fair but Villa fans, who watched their side be denied goals against Crystal Palace and Burnley, feel there is a little injustice against them. \u2018Embarrassing,\u2019 Smith could be spotted as saying as the television cameras panned to him.\n\nMATCH FACTS Aston Villa (4-3-3): Heaton 6; Guilbert 7, Engels 6, Mings 6, Targett 7; McGinn 6.5, Nakamba 6.5, Hourihane 6.5 (Trezeguet 63' 6); El Ghazi 6 (Douglas Luiz 76'), Wesley 6.5 (Davis 76'), Grealish 7.5 Subs not used: Taylor, Lansbury, Steer, Konsa Booked: Hourihane Brighton (4-4-2): Ryan 6; Montoya 6.5 (Duffy 70' 6), Webster 6.5, Dunk 6, Burn 6; Gross 7, Propper 6, Stephens 6, Mooy 4; Connolly 6 (March 45' 6), Maupay 6 (Alzate 81') Subs not used: Bissouma, Trossard, Murray, Button Booked: Montoya, March Sent off: Mooy Referee: David Coote\n\nIt was why when Villa did have the ball in the net through Grealish moments later, the same fans waited for Coote to point to the centre spot after the decision was checked before they celebrated.\n\nIt all made for an entertaining first half and gave the match an unpredictability as it entered the second period.\n\nAaron Connolly hadn\u2019t enjoyed the sort of game that he did when he scored twice in the 3-0 win over Tottenham and he was replaced by Solly March at half-time. It was a change made by Potter to give Brighton more width following Mooy\u2019s dismissal.\n\nMarch\u2019s first contribution was to send a shot inches past Tom Heaton\u2019s goal.\n\nDown the other end, Villa surged forward with Grealish orchestrating the attack. He set Matt Targett clear to send a cross into the 12-yard box. Hourihane caught the ball sweetly but the left leg of Ryan denied him and Anwar El Ghazi couldn\u2019t do any better as he sent the ball over.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t dissimilar to how Neal Maupay sent the ball over the Villa bar some time after although the striker\u2019s effort was from further out.\n\nNot that it mattered when Brighton were just a few feet out as Montoya realised when his tame effort ended up in the hands of Ryan when a more lethal finisher would have buried his shot.\n\nBy now, Brighton had opted for four central defenders at the back after Duffy replaced Montoya. Brighton were trying to limit Villa\u2019s crosses into the box so the hosts went through the middle. McGinn\u2019s shot rebounded off Duffy\u2019s back inside the Brighton area. \u2018Handball,\u2019 was the cry but after Coote, after checking with VAR, said no chance.\n\nOne last charge from Brighton and one last cross from Grealish came and went. Keinan Davis had a try but his shot was saved. Then came Targett, on the left side of the penalty area, he was calm with the ball at his feet, kept his head down and shot low past Ryan. What a moment and what a way to score your first Villa goal.", "description": "TOM FARMERY AT VILLA PARK: Left-back Matt Target smashed home a winner in the final minute of added time to secure a 2-1 win for Aston Villa against Brighton, who had Aaron Mooy sent off.", "authors": ["Tom Farmery For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/17/19930070-0-image-a-70_1571501011266.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
