Doug Collins called Tuesday for an \u201cinvestigation\u201d into CNN after the network reported that the CIA secretly extracted a spy from Russia in 2017.\n\nThe Georgia Republican and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee made the suggestion while speaking on Fox News about the explosive CNN report, aspects of which were subsequently corroborated by outlets including The New York Times and NBC News but dismissed by the CIA as \u201csimply false.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo put this out at this time and to put it such a way that the CIA actually had to come out and respond to this is really a disturbing part,\u201d Mr. Collins said.\n\n\u201cI really question whose side CNN is on,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a problem that we\u2019re seeing. I think that it needs to be investigated.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Mr. Collins clarified later Tuesday that he did not mean to call for launching a federal investigation into the network, however.\n\n\u201cWhen the CIA takes the step of coming out to contradict a story, it\u2019s worth asking how we got to that point,\u201d said Jessica Andrews, a spokesperson for Mr. Collins. \u201cThe Congressman was specifically calling for personal reflection on how a story with national security implications was published when our national intelligence experts say it\u2019s inaccurate.\u201d\n\nCNN did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAccording to CNN, the CIA pulled a high-level spy out of Russia in 2017 partially due to concerns involving President Trump\u2019s handling of sensitive information.\n\nThe Times reported later Monday that current U.S. officials insisted that \u201cmedia scrutiny of the agency\u2019s sources alone was the impetus for the extraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisguided speculation that the President\u2019s handling of our nation\u2019s most sensitive intelligence \u2014 which he has access to each and every day \u2014 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate,\u201d CIA director for public affairs Brittany Bramell responded to CNN\u2019s reporting in a statement.\n\n\u201cCNN\u2019s reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger,\u201d said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, the network reported Monday.\n\nThe spy had access to Russian President Vladimir Putin, both CNN and The Times reported, with the newspaper adding that he was instrumental in the CIA concluding that Mr. Putin had personally ordered Russia\u2019s interference campaign targeting the 2016 U.S. elections.\n\nRussian media outlets have subsequently identified the spy as possibly being a former Kremlin aide who was reported to have disappeared in June 2017.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed Tuesday that the individual worked in the Putin administration but denied he held a high-ranking position, Russian state media reported.\n\n\u201cAll these speculations in the American media that somebody urgently extracted someone and who rescued someone and so on are some sort of pulp fiction, you know. Let\u2019s leave it to them,\u201d said Mr. Peskov, TASS reported.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
