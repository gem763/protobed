The words \u201ccalloused\u201d and \u201cuncaring\u201d were used to describe the awful incident. At one point, the 911 dispatcher tells the victim to \u201cshut up,\u201d and that\u2019s after she scolded her for driving in the rain.\n\nThe victim, Debra Stevens, 47, was out driving and delivering newspapers when her car got swept up in the floodwaters in the early morning hours of August 24. Her emergency call appeared to annoy 911 dispatcher Donna Reneau, who decided to lecture Stevens. Stevens later drowned. Reneau had resigned from the department prior to this incident, but it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that her being selected as Fire Dispatcher of The Year probably should be rescinded (via WaPo):\n\n\n\n\n\nTime was running out for Debra Stevens. But the 911 dispatcher didn\u2019t seem concerned. \u201cSomebody save me!\u201d Stevens screamed as the water level crept up inside her car, which was stranded in floodwater. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re freaking out,\u201d the dispatcher, Donna Reneau, responded. \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d Stevens cried later. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Reneau said. Stevens did die, but only after the dispatcher told the Fort Smith, Ark., woman to \u201cshut up,\u201d chastised her for worrying that the phone call would cut off and berated her for driving into water \u2014 water the frantic flood victim swore she had not seen. \u201cWell, this will teach you,\u201d Reneau can be heard saying in audio of the call released this week by Fort Smith police. [\u2026] \u201cAll of our first responders who attempted to save Mrs. Stevens are distraught over the outcome,\u201d interim police chief Danny Baker said in a statement. \u201cFor every one of us, saving lives is at the very core of who we are and why we do what we do.\u201d [\u2026] Reneau\u2019s handling of the dying woman\u2019s call led to criticism and mistrust from the public. \u201cAfter hearing one of your dispatchers this morning \u2026 I\u2019m sick to my stomach,\u201d one man posted on a Facebook event for an upcoming Fort Smith \u201cCoffee with the Cops and 911 Dispatchers.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t call 911 in Fort Smith,\u201d another person commented under a police post promoting a Red Cross number for help with floodwaters. \u201cThey will let you die and tell you to \u2018shut up,\u2019 while you beg for help.\u201d [\u2026] Baker said the police department would have disciplined Reneau if she were still on the force, the Times Record reported. But he said he did not believe the phone call warranted firing or a criminal investigation. He did say, however, that Reneau may have failed to convey the urgency of Stevens\u2019s call to first responders, contributing to the woman\u2019s death.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time 911 dispatchers have been called out for their awful behavior. The list is rather extensive over the past couple of years. One woman pleaded guilty to hanging up on thousands of emergency calls in Houston, Texas. A New Mexico dispatcher was so annoyed with a mother trying to save the life of her dying son who was shot that he simply said, \u201cdeal with it yourself\u201d before hanging up. The victim, Jaydon Chavez-Silver, died. In the D.C.-area, a dispatcher actually told a teenager to \u201cstop whining\u201d as her father was dying following a hit and run. That operator was later fired. One dispatcher in Chicago told a 911 caller to stop yelling at her before hanging up. And then in Lincoln Park, Michigan, an operator hung up on a teenager whose father was having a brain seizure. The reason: she swore.\n\nThis isn\u2019t all 911 operators of course, but there appears to be plenty who appear to be total garbage human beings and probably shouldn\u2019t be in their positions. And it has led to tragic consequences.", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:54:26PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/275/6872ccd7-8d37-4dd3-ac7d-425f171545f4.jpg"}
