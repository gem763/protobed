George is the son of UK baron and conservative peer Michael Farmer \u2013 a London financier who has donated more than \u00a32.6million to the British Conservative party. Michael was dubbed 'Mr Copper' after making \u00a3100 million from metals trading.

He attended the elite fee-paying St Paul's School for Boys in London and was social secretary of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) in his first year. In 2012 it was revealed his dad funded his son's membership of the notorious Bullingdon Club at Oxford University, whose members are renowned for their excessive privilege and wild antics. During George Farmer's time in the Bullingdon Club, its members were accused of going on the rampage at a smart hotel. His dad also bailed out Oxford's Conservative Association when a racism row led to it being kicked out of the university. His son was a senior official at the time.

I've seen a lot of women treat their vendors, bridesmaids, make up artists, parents, (and sometimes even their grooms) terribly leading up to their wedding days. The most important thing for both George and I was to make sure every single person that played a role in our wedding, from the vendors to the guests, knew how grateful, excited and blessed we were to have them be a part of our wedding.\n\n'Our policy was kindness and love throughout the entire process. There are a lot of people I will thank in later posts but first and foremost, to our wedding planner: @justalittleditty Dickie Morris, we love you so much.\n\n'From start to finish just the most wonderful person in the entire world. You are now our planner for everything, forever and always.'\n\nHer new husband also kept things traditional, wearing a morning suit with tails.\n\nThey both shared a series of loved images from their special day to their social media pages where it appears their wedding ceremony was conducted outdoors.\n\nOwens posted to her 1.7 million followers: 'Before God, our family and friends\u2014 8/31/19.
