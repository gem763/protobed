Of those, about 1.5 million individuals died from the disease, including 251,000 people with HIV.\n\nWHO notes while millions are still impacted by tuberculosis, the mortality rate dropped by 42% globally between 2000 and 2018.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have achieved much in this fight to end TB, we can and must do better,\u201d said Tereza Kasaeva, director of the WHO\u2019s Global TB Programme, at Thursday\u2019s panel event. \u201cNo one with TB should miss out on the care they need.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations set a goal last September to reduce the number of tuberculosis deaths by 90% and the number of cases by 80% by 2030, compared to 2015 levels. For 2020, the U.N. is aiming for a 35% decrease in deaths and a 20% drop in the incidence.\n\nBut many countries and regions are not currently on track to reach the 2020 goals. Globally, the drop in the incidence rate from 2015 to 2018 was only 6.3%, about 14% short. There was an 11% drop in deaths between 2015 and 2018, 24% below next year\u2019s goal.\n\nHowever, the WHO European Region is on track to meet the 2020 goals.\n\nMost of the tuberculosis cases last year came from the WHO regions of South-East Asia (44%), Africa (24%), and the Western Pacific (18%). Both the Americas and Europe each had about 3% of the cases.\n\nAccording to WHO\u2019s report, eight countries made up two-thirds of the cases worldwide: India (27%), China (9%), Indonesia (8%), the Philippines (6%), Pakistan (6%), Nigeria (4%), Bangladesh (4%) and South Africa (3%).\n\nWhile 7 million people were diagnosed and treated for TB last year, there is still an estimated 3 million who did not receive the care they needed, according to WHO\u2019s report.\n\n\u201cAn unacceptably large gap remains between the number of reported cases and the estimated 10 million new cases each year,\u201d said Irene Koek, acting assistant administrator for global health for the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cUnless we are able to detect individuals with TB, start appropriate treatment quickly, support adherence until treatment is completed successfully, we will not be able to defeat this disease.\u201d\n\nFunding for tuberculosis research and development has increased and peaked in 2017 with $772 million from the U.S. But this is only 39% of the estimated $2 billion needed from the U.S. each year, the global health agency says.\n\nTo defeat the infectious disease, WHO says technological breakthroughs such as a vaccine to lower the risk of infection, rapid diagnostics for use at time of care and easier, shorter drug regimens for treating tuberculosis need to be prioritized.\n\nNo new technological advancements have emerged so far this year.\n\nAs of August, there were 23 drugs for tuberculosis, various combination regimens and 14 vaccine candidates in clinical trials. A vaccine candidate has proven effective in protecting against tuberculosis in a phase two clinical trial among individuals with a latent disease infection.\n\nTuberculosis is a bacterial disease that mainly affects the lungs and spreads through coughing and sneezing. Signs and symptoms could include coughing that lasts for weeks, coughing up blood, weight loss, chest pain, fever, fatigue and night sweats.\n\nMany strains of the infectious disease are resistant to the drugs most commonly used for treatment. Those with active tuberculosis have to take several medications for months to prevent antibiotic resistance and to treat the infection.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
