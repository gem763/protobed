She turned down a \u00a34,000 quote and transformed it herself with just \u00a3110, paint and sticky back plastic\n\nThe mother-of-two was quoted \u00a34,000 for a brand new kitchen, but decided the money would be better spent on a trip to Disneyland with her husband Jason, 32, and their daughters\n\nKaty Tate, 32, is pictured with her two daughters Mabel (left) and Edie (right) who got a trip to Disneyland instead of a new kitchen\n\nThe marketing manager said: 'The brown and blue weren't really to my taste and it was all quite dated - I just wanted to put my own stamp on it.\n\n'We were quoted \u00a34,000 for a completely new kitchen and we could've gone for it, but we chose to take our twin girls on holiday to Disney instead.\n\n'We weighed up the options and thought our money would be better spent on creating memories with our daughters, so we opted for something more temporary for the kitchen.\n\n'Last month, I started working on the kitchen on a whim because I'd had enough of the brown cupboards.\n\n'I gave it a go despite everyone putting off doing anything to the kitchen at all because they said it would look a mess and would be hard to do.'\n\nHow much did it cost? 5 x \u00a312 paint = \u00a360 2 x \u00a310 wood effect sticky back plastic = \u00a320 2 x bathroom vinyl = \u00a330 Total = \u00a3110\n\nAfter first taking on the project, Mrs Tate began to search for inspiration on Pinterest to match her quirky farmhouse-style vision for the kitchen.\n\nShe spotted tins of paint on sale for \u00a312 in B&M Bargains and painted over the brown wooden cabinets and cupboards in the kitchen, which took two and a half days overall and cost \u00a360 all together for five tins.\n\nThe DIY-mad mother then wrapped the kitchen counters, which were previously black and textured, with wood-effect sticky back plastic - and two rolls of it cost just \u00a310 each.\n\nBut for some time Mrs Tate didn't like how her new edits to the kitchen looked, and felt that the cream paint didn't match grey tiles behind the surfaces.\n\nSo she came across more sticky back plastic, which was initially supposed to be used for her new bathroom floor tiles, costing \u00a330 for two packs, and used this instead.\n\nThe mother-of-two managed to juggle decorating with looking after her twin girls Mabel and Edie, two, and divided her time wisely to spend under one week transforming her kitchen for just \u00a3110 in total.\n\nShe later splashed out on parquet effect 'wooden' flooring which was also made from lino and cost less than \u00a3200 to buy.\n\nMrs Tate added: 'I'm very pleased with how it all came so cheaply and I'm surprised at the durability so far after having it up for three weeks - I couldn't envision cooking Christmas dinner in the old one!\n\n'My husband's friend even came into our home and said 'I didn't realise you'd bought a new kitchen.'", "description": "Katy Tate, 32, wanted to freshen up her kitchen after buying the 1930s home in Durham in March.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/09/20026660-0-image-a-34_1571733308406.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
