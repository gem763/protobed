Some support for Ukrainian soldiers still comes through crowdfunding efforts.\n\nWhile the revelations about Trump and Zelenskiy\u2019s talks have rocked political circles, media coverage of the scandal has been muted here \u2013 a sharp contrast to the wall-to-wall reporting of the revelations in the foreign press. The scandal here is seen mainly as an American affair, said political analysts, and unlikely to take support from Zelenskiy.\n\nZelenskiy meets Trump: sitcom president finds himself trapped in a whodunnit Read more\n\nZelenskiy rode a wave of public support to the presidency this year, followed by a broad victory for his party, Servant of the People, which holds the first parliamentary majority in Ukraine\u2019s recent history. Recent approval ratings put his support at higher than 70%.\n\nOn Maidan, where Ukraine\u2019s revolution began just under six years ago, ordinary Kyivans were broadly supportive of the president, saying that dealing with Trump would require Zelenskiy to be flexible and use \u201ccharm\u201d. Of a dozen people approached by the Guardian, most said they had not read or seen reports about Zelenskiy\u2019s discussions with Trump.\n\nAccording to the memorandum describing the telephone call, Zelenskiy sought to flatter Trump, telling him that he had stayed at Trump Tower during a visit to New York and assuring him that prosecutors would look into the company where Biden\u2019s son was installed on the board of directors. He told the US president that the next prosecutor would be \u201c100% my person\u201d.\n\n\u201c[Trump] is a difficult character and I think Zelenskiy was in a hard position, he needed to find a common language,\u201d said Svitlana Bondarenko, 34, an accountant.", "description": "News of US pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskiy has sparked fears among reformers, but on the streets it is seen as an American affair", "authors": ["Andrew Roth", "Corey Brettschneider"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/136610b54a79cef559bcdd221e157fd1731009c4/0_266_4919_2950/master/4919.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=783a33b5ad47c82731b5b410d6c4a162", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
