Do not read on unless you have watched the season two finale.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re not a killer. You have to be a killer.\u2019\n\nWell this is a killer all right. A finale that seems to be tapering towards a sombre, inevitable conclusion only to lash you round the face with the sting in its tail and set us up for the already-commissioned third season.\n\nWith Logan making his curdling promise of a \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d last week, the emphasis shifted from which sibling will take over from Logan to who will be thrown out as red meat and bones to shareholders. They are getting restless at the inquiry into historical wrongdoing; one even suggests to Logan that he himself take the fall. He notes the suggestion.\n\nThe clan are gathered for a mini-break in Venice aboard a huge, overbearing ship that passes through the water like a giant black shark. It ought to be fun; Roman has been sprung from his Turkish captivity, an experience that has subdued him and taken the edge off his customary caustic wit. There\u2019s a scene of almost affectionate lightheartedness between the siblings as they soak up the sun together. But as Logan arrives in his black helicopter, the mood darkens, lowering all their spirits.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Almost affectionate ... Roman Roy softens after his ordeal. Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme Hunter\n\nHe immediately summons Roman, Karl and Laird for a debriefing on Turkey. Laird talks the thing up, and praises Roman for securing a new deal with the president\u2019s daughter\u2019s husband. But Roman, with surprising, selfless honesty, declares it \u201chorseshit\u201d. An angry Laird, who was due a big slice of commission on the deal, storms off and quits the boat.\n\nConnor, meanwhile, is anxious about the bad reviews for Willa\u2019s show. She almost steals this one, however, when she angrily throws the iPad overboard as she clocks the notices. Connor is in the financial crapper over the show; he sidles up to his dad to touch him for a $100m advance and maybe a lean on his papers to say nice things about the play. Logan agrees but only on the condition that he give up his presidential bid. \u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re a joke and you\u2019re fucking embarrassing me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Everyone thinks you\u2019re a joke and you\u2019re fucking embarrassing me\u2019 ... Connor and Logan. Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme Hunter\n\nOver breakfast with family and top executives, a truly Shakespearian scene unfolds as Logan tries to determine who will be the \u201chead on a spike\u201d to appease nervous shareholders. First Logan volunteers himself, only, inevitably, to be met with a shower of \u201cNo!\u201ds. One by one, the possible candidates to be thrown overboard suggest, in a spirit of selfless generosity, candidates other than themselves. Roman proposes a \u201cloyal servant like Karl\u201d, for which the latter thanks him. There\u2019s a polite pile-on on Gerri, though as Roman says, haven\u2019t we killed enough women recently? The focus turns to Tom \u2013 perhaps with some \u201cGreg sprinkles\u201d? To his indignation, Shiv agrees that it would be \u201clogical\u201d. Connor, with magnificent conceit, then suggests himself as the \u201cold Richelieu\u201d, pulling the strings all these years. We\u2019ll bear it in mind, half-smiles Logan.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Who would have thought he would be the one to call time? ... Tom opens up to Shiv. Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme Hunter\n\nOn a trip to a nearby cove, Tom opens up to Shiv. She had suggested a threesome earlier but Tom had demurred at the last minute, clearly nervous at the prospect. He now reveals he has never been happy about the open relationship, proposed by Shiv on their wedding day, that he feels \u201cshanghaied into an open borders free fuck trade deal\u201d. He\u2019s genuinely unhappy with her, he says. Who would have thought he would have been the one to call time on the relationship? It\u2019s his most affecting moment of the series. Shiv later pleads with Logan, however, not to sacrifice Tom. \u201cFor me.\u201d\n\nKendall is sent for by his father. There\u2019s a deathly inevitability about what happens next, especially as Logan relates how the Incas would sacrifice a child to the sun in times of crisis. \u201cYou\u2019re the face \u2013 the optics make sense.\u201d Kendall accepts his fate with the docile, filial devotion he has displayed all series.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Deathly inevitability ... Logan puts Kendall\u2019s head on a spike. Photograph: Home Box Office/Graeme Hunter\n\nA press conference is set up; he\u2019ll make a prepared statement, explaining his role in the illegality in the cruises division then take questions. Except he doesn\u2019t. Instead, he declares, \u201cthe truth is that my father is a malignant presence, a bully and a liar and was fully aware of these events\u201d, before concluding \u201cI think this is the day his reign ends\u201d. Greg is standing by with an envelope full of documents which Logan signed off on. He\u2019s in this too; his vengeance for being screwed over last week. Logan, watching the conference on TV, doesn\u2019t explode. Instead, a strange look of pride floats across his face, as if to say, that\u2019s my boy. Not the servile figure Logan has probably been holding in contempt, but a killer after all. Still, this means war \u2026\n\nThe heir apparent?\n\nRoman, in an announcement tossed out by Logan almost as an afterthought. He\u2019s now sole chief operating officer. But it doesn\u2019t feel momentous, and Roman himself, scared decent by his recent ordeal, is more concerned for Kendall having to take the rap than his new responsibilities.\n\nNotes and observations\n\n\u2022 There is a touch of the Citizen Kanes about Connor\u2019s bankrolling of Willa\u2019s clearly awful show, reminders of Susan Alexander and her terrible opera career. Except Willa lacks Susan Alexander\u2019s low sense of self-esteem and her benefactor is being bankrupted by the folly.\n\n\u2022 It would be a great shame for Connor to have to give up his Presidential campaign, especially now he has his army of \u201cConheads\u201d. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s revived for series three.\n\n\u2022 Despite perilously low ratings, HBO have shown proper boldness in recommissioning Succession. Its reputation has grown enormously this time round; with its relentlessly acidic wit, it has represented many of the sordid realities and characters of modern life \u2013 Weinstein, Trump, Murdoch \u2013 with unerring pertinence. Meanwhile, as he did with Peep Show, creator Jesse Armstrong has shown that a series can not only survive but thrive without likeable, moral and sympathetic characters. And even find a way of making us care for them. Until we meet again \u2026", "description": "A truly Shakespearean closer, which sets us up for another stunning season.
