On Tuesday Brent crude had fallen back to $67.98 a barrel, while WTI crude was 1% lower at $62.26.\n\nSaudi Arabia remains the only country with meaningful spare capacity\u2014supply that can be quickly turned on in an emergency. It also produces a variety of grades of crude that it ships to large Asian buyers such as China, Japan and Korea.\n\nSome of those grades have different densities and other unique characteristics, meaning they could be difficult to replace, particularly for countries that have few other options to access crude.\n\nThe threat of supply shortages comes after worries about weakening demand had pushed down fuel costs for global consumers, relieving some pressure on the global economy that was feeling the effects from the U.S.-China trade war. Now, consumers could face higher retail gasoline and heating costs in the coming weeks, cutting into available income.\n\nWhile other countries have sizable production potential, analysts say that supply can\u2019t necessarily cushion the market when Saudi exports get disrupted.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Could the U.S. compete as a global oil exporter? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a pretty harsh reminder of that,\u201d said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management. The disruption \u201cwas completely unexpected\u2026People are so hypersensitive to this because it\u2019s a topic we had largely taken off the table.\u201d\n\nMs. Babin said investors who had bet oil prices or shares of energy producers would fall, or used so-called short bets to hedge against drops, were unwinding those positions Monday, exacerbating the market\u2019s moves. Some shares of producers including Devon Energy Corp. and Marathon Oil Corp. soared 12% or more.\n\nThe powerful moves came after short positions held by commodity trading advisers, or CTAs\u2014many of which use algorithms to follow trends\u2014in oil and natural-gas futures recently hit record levels, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis. That could mean more big swings lie ahead.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely some unwinding going on,\u201d Ms. Babin said.\n\nThe attacks over the weekend knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day, or roughly 5% of the world\u2019s supply. They also targeted Abqaiq, the world\u2019s largest crude processing facility and the heart of the kingdom\u2019s energy infrastructure.\n\nSatellite images of Saudi Arabia showed significant damage to complex, expensive pieces of equipment that could be tough to repair or replace, analysts said. The strikes were the latest in a string of attacks on the kingdom\u2019s oil infrastructure in recent months as tensions continue between Iran and the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest oil supply disruption on record,\u201d said Jason Bordoff, founding director at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. \u201cPeople recognize that an asymmetric attack in the region can cause catastrophic damage to the most important oil producer in the world.\u201d\n\nAlthough the kingdom is trying to get production back online and use its inventories to avoid sizable shortages, the scope of the attacks fueled bets on higher energy prices as analysts weighed the specter of a broader conflict in the Middle East.\n\nSaid Haidar, head of New York-based Haidar Capital Management, purchased investments tied to Brent crude on Monday, betting that Saudi Arabia will struggle to get its production back online.\n\n\u201cThis is going to last for a while and it looks like it has the potential to push prices higher,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Haidar also noted the U.S. lacks the capability to export much of its oil production. His fund sold the currencies of oil importers that could be hit by higher prices, such as India and Indonesia, and bought the currencies of countries that could benefit from the rally, including exporters Canada and Russia.\n\nStorage tanks are seen at the North Jiddah bulk plant, an Aramco oil facility, in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.

President Trump said Sunday the U.S. would be willing to dip into its Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed to keep markets well supplied. The SPR currently contains more than 600 million barrels.\n\nAnalysts said they were also awaiting updates from the International Energy Agency, which said over the weekend it was still monitoring the situation but didn\u2019t provide information about a possible inventory release.\n\nSaudi Arabia held a series of calls with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other allies over the weekend and told producers that they wouldn\u2019t need to respond with additional supply, Saudi and OPEC officials said Monday.\n\nUntil more details are released, though, investors said they expected momentum in the sector to continue, benefiting companies in a position to capitalize on higher prices.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\n\u201cYou absolutely have to look at U.S. shale producers and look at producers who are in the safest locations and have the lowest disruption risk,\u201d said Shawn Reynolds, portfolio manager for investment manager VanEck\u2019s natural-resources equity strategies. \u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be a premium on those barrels and the companies that produce them.\u201d\n\nOthers have been happy to take profits given the uncertainty moving the market.\n\nVinay Pande, head of trading strategies at UBS Global Wealth Management\u2019s chief investment office, locked in gains on investments linked to the oil price Monday.\n\n\u201cMy inclination\u2026is to lighten up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure have led to a production shutdown on a scale the world hasn\u2019t seen for decades. It could have long-lasting consequences for global markets and politics.
