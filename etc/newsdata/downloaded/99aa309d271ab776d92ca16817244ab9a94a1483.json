Investors are cautious on the company with other new streaming launches from Apple, Disney and HBO on the horizon. Netflix's stock took a dive on Tuesday after Apple announced its original TV service will cost $4.99 a month and launch Nov. 1. Netflix raised the price of its subscription plan to $8.99 in January.\n\nPiper Jaffray is optimistic third-quarter subscriber numbers for Netflix will come back from disappointing second quarter numbers, which shocked investors and caused the stock to drop 20% since their release. The firm's analysis points to third-quarter subscriber additions that are in-line with estimates for domestic additions and potentially above expectations for international additions.\n\nOlson estimates third-quarter domestic subscription growth will be around 6.4% year-over-year and international growth in a range of 33% to 35%.\n\nNetflix's content slate in the second half of 2019 is much stronger than in the second-quarter, Olson added. A new season of The Crown and several original films such as El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie and The Irishman from Martin Scorsese are expected to boost subscribers.\n\n\"There should be a positive impact from an improving slate and we are, therefore, optimistic about the company's opportunity to grow subscriber additions y/y on a FY basis,\" said Olson.\n\nShares of Netflix were 2% higher on Friday.\n\n\u2014 with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.", "description": "Netflix's stock is lagging the broader market because of increased competition in the streaming space, but Piper Jaffray says to buy the dip.", "authors": ["Maggie Fitzgerald"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104976265-Netflixlogo1.jpg?v=1568374653", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
