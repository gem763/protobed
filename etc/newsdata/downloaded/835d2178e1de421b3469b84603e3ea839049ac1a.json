The auto and component makers in and around Manesar, have shed thousands of jobs.\n\nNationwide, according to industry estimates, automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since the start of the year, in response to plunging car sales. Figures for August, like July, are expected to show a drop of more than 30%, making a 10th straight month of decline.\n\nAs the crisis in the sector bites harder small businesses in the towns and villages around Manesar, home to one of the three plants where Maruti Suzuki cars are made, have seen a fall off in trade.\n\n\"There are already fewer workers in the village and those who still have jobs are either not getting paid for working overtime or are not spending as much out of fear they may lose work and need the money,\" said grocer Rahul Jain, his shelves stacked with toothpaste and soaps from fast-moving consumer goods companies like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Dabur India.\n\nEven sales of products like cooking oil and flour have fallen. On the lower rungs of the service sector, barbers and tea stall owners said they had fewer customers.\n\nShoe seller Subhay Singh, in Manesar's Aliyar village, has days when he doesn't make a single sale.\n\n\"My monthly earnings have halved,\" said Singh, who a year ago made an average 8,000 rupees a day. \"I don't know what's happening.\"\n\nIn the United States there was an old adage: \"When General Motors sneezes, the Wall Street catches a cold.\" In India, the impact goes well beyond the stock market.\n\nIndia's automotive industry is the fourth largest in the world, employing more than 35 million people, directly and indirectly, and accounting for nearly half of India's manufacturing output.\n\nThe industry has three main centres; Gurugram in the North, Chennai in the South, where among others Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor have plants, and Pune in the West, where Tata Motors and Fiat are located.\n\nAll of them are hurting, and the pain is radiating outwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nNEEDING A HAIRCUT\n\nBefore suffering the steepening slump in sales, the auto industry provided one of the few bright spots for manufacturing. Its troubles stem in part from banks' and non-banking finance houses' reluctance to extend consumer loans, as well as subdued demand, particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of Indians live.\n\nLaid-off workers returning to their villages are now putting more burden on a rural sector already suffering falling income from low crop prices, and dampening consumer sentiment and growth across the country.\n\nGurmeet Singh had been earning 10,000 rupees a month until he lost his job at auto component maker Bellsonica in Manesar. Six months later, back in his hometown of Ambala in Haryana state, Singh is still looking for a job, and catastrophising about the future.\n\n\"I haven't had a hair cut in months, my shoes are torn and I've been using the same pair of clothes since I lost my job. Only I know how I am surviving,\" said the 26-year-old.\n\n\"If I don't get a job, how will I build a house for my family, get married and pay off the loan my parents took to educate me?\" he said.\n\nHis bleak outlook reflects an increasingly grim big picture. India's economic growth slipped to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was re-elected to a second term in a landslide in May, is under pressure to provide a stimulus for an economy that is seriously undershooting the growth rate needed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young Indians entering the labour market every month.\n\n\n\n\n\nRESISTING A BISCUIT\n\nAll this is cast against a backdrop of a weakening world economy, and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the United States and China.\n\nThings are so manifestly bad that even one of the nation's most popular biscuitmakers, Parle Products Private Limited, is worried about the impact of the auto industry's troubles on sales.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The narrow lanes in Aliyar and Kasan villages in Manesar, an automotive manufacturing hub on New Delhi's southern outskirts, would usually be packed on Sundays with migrant workers employed at the nearby plants enjoying their day off, but not anymore.
