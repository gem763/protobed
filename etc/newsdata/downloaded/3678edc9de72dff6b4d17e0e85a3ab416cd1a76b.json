Investigators previously suggested that Williams wrestled away Mulkeen's gun while the pair were on the ground.\n\nOfficials said the nearly seven-year department veteran retained control of his weapon and fired several shots during the encounter.\n\nRETIRED NYPD SERGEANT REPORTEDLY KILLS HIMSELF AMID DEPARTMENT'S 'MENTAL-HEALTH CRISIS'\n\nMulkeen and two plainclothes officers were on patrol near a city housing complex around 12:30 a.m. during an investigation into potential gang activity.\n\nDuring the questioning of Williams, he allegedly fled behind a building. Mulkeen, a former college track star, tackled Williams, who went after the officer's weapon during a struggle, according to the NYPD.\n\nMulkeen's body camera captured him saying: \"He's reaching for it! He's reaching for it!\"\n\n\u201cMulkeen retained his firearm during the entire violent struggle he had with this suspect,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cHe fired five rounds at the suspect.\u201d\n\nInvestigators determined several officers fired 10 shots. Mulkeen, though wearing a bulletproof vest, was hit in the head and torso, officials said.\n\nThey said the torso shot exited his body through his thigh. He was taken to a hospital where he later died.\n\n\u201cIt was a violent struggle and from start to finish, from first round to last round, was 10 seconds,\u201d the commissioner said, according to the New York Post. \u201cJust think about that. Think about how quick that is.\u201d\n\nInvestigators found a .pistol they said belonged to Williams. It was never fired, they added. Williams was on probation until 2022 for a drug-related arrest last year. He had several prior arrests, and his record includes a burglary conviction, NYPD officials said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIt was unclear if any of the rounds fired by Mulkeen struck Williams.\n\nMulkeen's death is the second of an NYPD officer from friendly fire this year. Queens Det.
