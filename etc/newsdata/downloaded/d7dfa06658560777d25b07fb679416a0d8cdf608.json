What do you notice first?\n\nThe answer for most people will probably be the internal structure, the colour of the walls, the light entering through the windows. But stay a little longer and you might start to experience the space differently: you\u2019ll hear sound reverberating, you\u2019ll feel air currents, textures and materials, you\u2019ll smell wafts from the kitchen.\n\nFor blind people, this multi-sensory experience is their first impression of a space. And now a new programme is trying to harness that unique ability by training more visually impaired people to become architects.\n\nAs the first step in running a foundation course aimed at people who see things differently, the Bartlett School of Architecture at UCL ran an architecture and design workshop for people with visual impairments this summer.\n\n\u201cGoing to start an architecture degree as a visually impaired person is so horrendously daunting, there\u2019s so much that\u2019s inaccessible,\u201d said one of the students on the five-day course, Poppy Levison, who is about to start studying at Central Saint Martins.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been brought up to analyse spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember my vision support worker when I was four asking: \u2018Is it better if the window\u2019s behind you in the classroom?\u2019 It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always been asked to think about.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Partially sighted student Poppy Levison showing her final \u2018box of feelings\u2019 to sighted architect Shade Abdul Photograph: Jos Boys\n\nOne key exercise in the workshop involves documenting how different spaces make you feel. Levison has particularly enjoyed sharing thoughts with her fellow students. \u201cI know my experience, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s always going to be best for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cSome people really like daylight, and some people really don\u2019t. It\u2019s about finding ways in the future to balance those ideas within a building.\u201d\n\nThe workshop is run by the DisOrdinary Architecture Project, which aims to change attitudes towards disability and accessibility. DisOrdinary promotes the social model of disability, which argues that people are only disabled when they are confronted with a barrier. If those barriers are removed, the disability ceases to exist.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside?

Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

As well as wanting to increase diversity in a profession he describes as a \u201cmonoculture\u201d dominated by white architects from mostly affluent backgrounds, he is looking to foster new ways of thinking about architectural aesthetics.\n\n\u201cIt occurred to me you\u2019d get different ideas if you had some people involved where the visual sense wasn\u2019t their primary way of thinking about things,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to disrupt the architectural fixation with the visual. I don\u2019t want to patronise blind people or lead them up the garden path.\u201d\n\nHe testifies to genuine interest from the profession in increasing representation from people with visual impairments and other disabilities. \u201cAs soon as I mention it to leading practices, Norman Foster and so on, they want to be involved. They have the same issues about diversity and new thinking.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are some visually impaired people working as architects (often without disclosing their disabilities for fear of stigma), Penn has identified just two practising blind architects in the world. One of these is Chris Downey, a San Francisco-based architect who teaches on the DisOrdinary course. He lost his sight 11 years ago, after 20 years in the profession.\n\nDowney is doubtful that, at present, architecture is a viable profession for someone who has been blind since birth. While there are workarounds to enable the blind and severely visually impaired to contribute \u2013 for instance through tactile drawings and 3D printing \u2013 licensing exams are a barrier. \u201cI don\u2019t know that you could go into a traditional practice,\u201d he says.\n\nNevertheless, there is a spectrum of visual impairment, and Downey thinks that even for those who are completely blind, there is value in learning the principles of architectural design, not least because these can be applied to a range of creative careers. His experience of becoming blind later in life has fundamentally shaped his understanding of the purpose of architecture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the sight I\u2019ve lost, but the realisation of how much of the environmental experience that I wasn\u2019t designing, that I was leaving to chance, leaving to possible failure because I wasn\u2019t designing for it,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered more possibilities and a strategy toward a richer design than I was working with when I was sighted.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
