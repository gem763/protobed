He is currently the head of news and sports for WarnerMedia.\n\nAT&T, which is trying to fend off an activist investor and figure out its executive succession plan, could still tap someone from outside the company. But the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said Zucker has emerged as the one internal name to take the WarnerMedia CEO job if its current chief, John Stankey, becomes CEO of AT&T.\n\nSelecting Zucker to lead WarnerMedia would present significant risks for AT&T, both because he had a troubled tenure at NBCUniversal and because of his relationship with President Donald Trump, all five sources said. Still, in an industry where experienced and decisive leaders are hard to come by, Zucker could be a powerful force to lead WarnerMedia in a fiercely competitive Hollywood landscape.\n\nNBCUniversal is the parent company of NBC News.\n\nBoth Zucker and a WarnerMedia spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAT&T's executive succession plan remains in some doubt. Elliott Management, the activist hedge fund that owns about $3 billion worth of AT&T stock, has argued that the company's leadership has made numerous missteps, including the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner (since renamed WarnerMedia) that brought Zucker and the rest of the media giant under AT&T.\n\nZucker's rise and fall \u2014 and rise again \u2014 is media industry lore. He took over as executive producer of the \"Today\" show, the NBC News morning program, at the age of 26 and helped lead the show to ratings success over its network rivals. In 2005, he was named chief executive of the NBCUniversal Television Group, which was then owned by General Electric.\n\nBut under Zucker's leadership, NBC went from a leader in TV ratings to last place among its network competitors. In 2010, Zucker stepped down from his role atop NBC after NBCUniversal was acquired by Comcast.\n\nThe reviews of his tenure at the time were not particularly favorable. In one memorable column, Maureen Dowd of The New York Times asked, \"How does Jeff Zucker keep rising and rising while the fortunes of NBC keep falling and falling?\"\n\nThe missteps at NBC, however, did not banish him from the media industry. In 2012, CNN named Zucker its president. While CNN remains behind cable news rivals Fox News and MSNBC in its TV ratings, its online presence has cemented its place as one of the leading news brands in the U.S. Zucker has also helped CNN double its profits.\n\nAfter the AT&T acquisition, Zucker was named head of news and sports for WarnerMedia. He is also one of the few remaining heads of a major WarnerMedia group after former Warner Bros. chief Kevin Tsujihara and former HBO chief Richard Plepler both left the company.", "description": "CNN President Jeff Zucker is the leading candidate to become chief executive of WarnerMedia, sources say.", "authors": ["Dylan Byers"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/103642914-GettyImages-494203341.jpg?v=1529471665", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
