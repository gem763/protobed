The world economy now looks even weaker than the bank\u2019s June forecast for 2.6% growth in 2019, \u201churt by Brexit, Europe\u2019s recession and trade uncertainty,\u201d he added.\n\nMalpass renewed his global growth warning as investors are keeping an eye on several major issues that could come to a head this month.\n\nHigh-level U.S.-China trade talks resume this week -- before the next planned tariff escalation Oct. 15 -- and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 without a deal if necessary. Meanwhile, economic indicators from Europe are flashing red as a slump in manufacturing increasingly affects domestic demand.\n\nMalpass repeated his criticism of the roughly $15 trillion of bonds with zero or negative yields, describing it as \u201cfrozen capital\u201d that\u2019s diverting resources from growth and benefiting bondholders and issuers of the debt.\n\nThe heads of the global institutions are gathering amid growing concern about how threats from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars to Brexit are weighing on world expansion. There are also fresh faces in place after IMF chief Christine Lagarde left to lead the European Central Bank and was succeeded by Bulgarian economist Kristalina Georgieva, formerly chief executive of the World Bank.\n\nRead more: Click here for the most recent research from Bloomberg Economics\n\nThe IMF has also indicated it may lower its 2019 outlook from after the fund in July projected 3.2% growth -- the lowest since the financial crisis. The IMF is preparing to release its updated forecast next week.\n\nTrump nominated Malpass in February, choosing a supporter who\u2019d criticized China and backed a shakeup of the global economic order. Malpass, who previously portrayed the lender as inefficient and reluctant to cut funding for developing countries that grow into dynamic emerging markets, was selected in April to serve a five-year term.\n\n--With assistance from Sandrine Rastello.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Sarah McGregor in Washington at smcgregor5@bloomberg.net;Jeff Kearns in Washington at jkearns3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Sarah McGregor, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
