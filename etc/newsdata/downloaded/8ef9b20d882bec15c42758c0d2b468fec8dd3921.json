He then applied local cost-of-living data from US Bureau of Economic Analysis, which included the price of housing, services, and goods.\n\nKolko notes that unadjusted salary figures are highest in \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 California metros like San Jose and San Francisco. But when cost of living is factored in to arrive at the true purchasing power for the average worker, those places fall down the list.\n\n\"The ten metros with the highest adjusted salaries are all small and mid-size metros,\" Kolko wrote. \"These aren't just odd exceptions \u2014 it's a general pattern. Unadjusted salaries are 7% higher in metros with at least two million people than in metros with fewer than 250,000 people \u2014 but salaries after adjusting for living costs are 9% lower. \"\n\nKolko concluded: \"For job seekers in most places, there's another metro with a similar mix of jobs that offers higher adjusted salaries.\"\n\nOf the 50 largest metro areas by population, these are the 17 where salaries go the furthest.", "description": "An economist from the Indeed Hiring Lab uncovered which of America's largest metros have the highest salaries after adjusting for cost of living.", "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d791c112e22af051a6ba447-1136-568.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
