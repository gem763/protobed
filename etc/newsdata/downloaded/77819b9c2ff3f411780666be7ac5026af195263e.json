But as much fun as McLaren\u2019s 720S is\u2014and with 710 hp balled up like a chain-mail fist, how could it not be?\u2014it\u2019s anything but a carefree motoring experience.\n\nIn daily driving, every speed bump, parking ramp and curb claws at these cars, threatening to rake the low-slung carbon-fiber bits. Down at the McLaren dealership, replacing a splintered splitter costs thousands. Jeeves has got to get his beak wet.\n\nIn a dozen ways, the 720S\u2019s Homeric immensity\u20140-124 mph in 7.8 seconds! Top speed 212 mph!\u2014haunts your ability to enjoy it as a long-distance road car. I drove one from Woking, Surrey, to Snowdonia in Wales, and back in 24 hours, a couple of years ago. Ten hours of twin-turbo V8 and tire drone made me want to eat my hand. And how can it be that two people can\u2019t take a weekend road trip without a baggage train? Harley-Davidsons have more cargo capacity.\n\nThe McLaren GT ($213,195, before options and delivery) is the first of a new family of Maccas that will be posher and plummier, withal\u2014quieter, roomier, more useful and more commodious, with a cockpit suitable for multiday driving as opposed to just some hot laps at Lime Rock.\n\nThese GT-series cars will also be the first into which one can fit a golf bag. Or two sets of 185 cm skis, the company helpfully pointed out. Or yoga mats, the katanas from kendo class, or other household items.\n\nA SPORTY SPICE The GT accommodates golf clubs, skis and other longer items on a leather- or textile-covered parcel shelf, built over the engine compartment and under the sweeping rear hatch glass.

On this fine-weathered Sunday, the road was swarmed with sport motorcyclists leaning over their knees in and out of mountain curves edged with blocks of white-painted granite. Yee hah.\n\nWhat\u2019s a man to do? With the aero, chassis, and powertrain dials set to the heart of the sun, my co-driver and I went for it\u2014him more than me. The GT just freakin\u2019 rips.\n\nOn this road, in this car, you typically get one stunning, eyeball-flattening 7,000-rpm upshift to pass traffic and then, brother, you gotta get on them big carbon binders before the next curve. In those corners, almost all the car\u2019s grip is mechanical. Good thing there\u2019s so much.\n\nSome notes: If the 720S is a soprano, the GT is a low tenor, with a resonance and character that makes itself felt without exceeding Euro noise limits. GT legit.\n\nAt slower speeds, in Sport mode, the GT\u2019s hydraulic steering feedback is light, well-greased and relatively relaxed; as speeds increase the assist fades and the steering becomes more focused and self-centering. That\u2019s across all drive modes. That feels proper for a GT, too.\n\nIn high-load cornering, the talkback from the front tires is, I mean, flawless. The brake pedal stroke is longer and heavier than in the 720S. I guess the test drivers felt that was better for distance driving. Less fretful pedal use, maybe? When fully engaged, the four-way carbon-ceramic brakes will un-fill your teeth.\n\n\u201c \u2018The GT-series cars will be the first into which one can fit a golf bag\u2014or 185 cm skis, the company helpfully pointed out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nZero-to-60 passes in a violent, effortless 3.1 seconds, officially; if bang on you\u2019ll see 120 mph in 9 seconds. Top speed: 203 mph, which qualifies as fast enough.\n\nWhile based on the same carbon composite-aluminum monocoque and powertrain as other McLarens, the GT has its own exterior drama and interior piquancy. The car\u2019s rectilinear volumes and formal character lines end with that ultra-fastback hatch, with the roof line touching down breathlessly near the edge of spoiler, with its millimeter-scale upward fiilip. Oh that\u2019s nice.\n\nThe GT\u2019s front overhang is quite a bit longer than other McLarens and slightly turned up to avoid catching on what McLaren calls \u201cspeed-calming measures\u201d and parking curbs.\n\nThere is also\u2014do you see it?\u2014a bit of nostalgia in the GT, something like supercar classique. If the 720S\u2019s form language is biomimetic and futuristic, the GT is sculpted and styled, even dainty. That\u2019s surprising for a car whose side air intakes could consume a condor.\n\nON THE FLY The GT (standing for \u201cGrand Tourer) accelerates from naught to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds, and 124 mph in 9 seconds flat. Photo: Mclaren Automotive\n\nOutward visibility isn\u2019t a problem, especially in cars fitted with the optional electrochromic panoramic glazed roof. It\u2019s a glassy firmament, a magical canopy.\n\nBut where to put the golf clubs? Committed to about the same roofline and height as the 720S, the engineers first gave the 4.0-liter V8 a haircut, shrinking the induction plenums and plumbing, lowering its height in the car. Laid over the engine compartment is a curvaceous parcel shelf running lengthwise, with a deeper swale in the middle, a shape that can cradle longer objects. Voil\u00e0, golf clubs under glass.\n\nTo keep engine heat from melting one\u2019s dimpled balls, outside air is pushed through baffles in the shelf support, working a bit like a trapped water in neoprene wetsuit to insulate against more extreme temperatures in the engine compartment.\n\nIt took extraordinary effort, engineering, as well as some nifty nano-textiles, to produce this golf cart of the End Times. But it was worth it: I award the GT the Palmer d\u2019Or.\n\n2020 McLaren GT\n\nPLEASE BE SEATED A view through the McLaren\u2019s GT\u2019s dihedral-hinged driver\u2019s door, showing the touring seats.
