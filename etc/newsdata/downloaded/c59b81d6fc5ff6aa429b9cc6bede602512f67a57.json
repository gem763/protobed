Amy Klobuchar and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke have met the donor requirement but have just one poll each, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro have zero qualifying polls.", "description": "Candidates need both 165,000 individual donors and to earn either 3% in four DNC-approved national polls or 5% in three approved early-state polls.", "authors": ["Grace Panetta"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d938ab62e22af620453db9e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
