Even worse, the employment subcomponent which generally tends to be a good gauge of overall NFP data fell to within a whisker of the 50 boom/bust line suggesting that employment growth may have slowed markedly.\n\nThe forecast for today\u2019s number is 145K and with traders already geared for a negative surprise, only a print below 100K would truly shock the market. But with most participants already forecasting a Fed rate cut the downside effect on may be contained. The pair has already broken support at 107.00 and could test the 106.00 on a truly weak print but with much of the downside priced in, for now, that figure should provide a modicum of support for the time being.\n\nWhat is becoming clear by the moment is that the US growth decoupling story is clearly being refuted by the data and as markets continue to adjust for a synchronized slowdown in global growth the weakness could persist into the end of the year.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Boris Schlossberg covering: USD/JPY, XAU/USD, DAX, Nikkei 225.
