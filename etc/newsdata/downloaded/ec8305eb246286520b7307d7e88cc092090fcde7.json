But the whistle-blower\u2019s stark, straightforward account of stupefying treachery deserves to be repeated as often as possible.\n\n\u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. government officials that the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d the whistle-blower wrote. \u201cThis interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president\u2019s main domestic political rivals. The president\u2019s personal lawyer, Mr. Rudolph Giuliani, is a central figure in this effort. Attorney General Barr appears to be involved as well.\u201d\n\nAttorney General Barr appears to be involved as well. The whistle-blower\u2019s complaint was deemed credible and urgent by Michael Atkinson, Trump\u2019s own intelligence community inspector general, but Bill Barr\u2019s Justice Department suppressed it. The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion saying that the complaint needn\u2019t be turned over to Congress, as the whistle-blower statute instructs. When Atkinson made a criminal referral to the Justice Department, it reportedly didn\u2019t even open an investigation. And all the time, Barr was named in the complaint that his office was covering up.\n\nUnder any conceivable ethical standard, Barr should have recused himself. But ethical standards, perhaps needless to say, mean nothing in this administration.\n\n[Listen to \u201cThe Argument\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]\n\nIn the Ukraine scandal, evidence of comprehensive corruption goes far beyond Trump. Former prosecutors have said that Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, may have been part of a criminal conspiracy when he pressed Ukrainian officials to open an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Vice President Mike Pence is also tied to the shakedown of Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, having met with him this month to talk about \u201ccorruption\u201d and American financial aid. When this administration complains about Ukrainian \u201ccorruption,\u201d it almost inevitably means a failure to corruptly pursue investigations that would bolster conspiracy theories benefiting Trump.\n\nThe whistle-blower wrote that White House officials moved a word-for-word transcript of Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky from the computer system where such transcripts were typically kept into a separate system for the most highly classified information. \u201cAccording to White House officials I spoke with, this was \u2018not the first time\u2019 under this administration that a presidential transcript was placed into this codeword-level system solely for the purpose of protecting politically sensitive \u2014 rather than national security sensitive \u2014 information,\u201d the whistle-blower said.\n\nAccording to Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University School of Law, any lawyers involved in hiding these transcripts might have done something illegal. \u201cThe rule is it is both unethical and a crime for a lawyer to participate in altering, destroying or concealing a document, and here the allegation is that the word-for-word transcript was moved from the place where people ordinarily would think to look for it, to a place where it would not likely be found,\u201d said Gillers. \u201cThat\u2019s concealing.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Barr\u2019s personal involvement in the Ukraine plot. In the reconstruction of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky that was released by the White House, Trump repeatedly said that he wanted Ukraine\u2019s government to work with Barr on investigating the Bidens. Barr\u2019s office insists that the president hasn\u2019t spoken to Barr about the subject, but given the attorney general\u2019s record of flagrant dishonesty \u2014 including his attempts to mislead the public about the contents of the Mueller report \u2014 there\u2019s no reason to believe him. Besides, said Representative Jamie Raskin, a former constitutional law professor who now sits on the House Judiciary Committee, \u201cthe effort to suppress the existence of the phone conversation itself is an obvious obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nBut Barr\u2019s refusal to recuse creates a sort of legal cul-de-sac. It\u2019s only the Justice Department, ultimately, that can prosecute potential federal crimes arising from this scandal. Barr\u2019s ethical nihilism, his utter indifference to ordinary norms of professional behavior, means that he\u2019s retaining the authority to stop investigations into crimes he may have participated in.\n\n\u201cThe administration of justice is cornered because the ultimate executive authority for that government role includes the people whose behavior is suspect,\u201d said Gillers.\n\nThat makes the impeachment proceedings in the House, where Barr will likely be called as a witness, the last defense against complete administration lawlessness. \u201cJust as the president is not above the law, the attorney general is not above the law,\u201d said Raskin. \u201cThe president\u2019s betrayal of his oath of office and the Constitution is the primary offense here, and we need to stay focused on that, but the attorney general\u2019s prostitution of the Department of Justice for the president\u2019s political agenda has been necessary to the president\u2019s schemes and he will face his own reckoning.\u201d\n\nI hope Raskin is right. But until that day comes, people who care about the rule of law in this country should be screaming for Barr\u2019s recusal, even if he won\u2019t listen. He is now wrapped up in one of the gravest scandals in American political history. Can America\u2019s chief law enforcement officer really be allowed to decide whether to criminally investigate misdeeds he might have helped to commit or to conceal? The answer will tell us just how crooked the justice system under Trump has become.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
