The Swiss tactician, who appeared to injure himself while celebrating a goal, was under fire after claiming just two wins in the previous eight games across all competitions.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Leipzig routed Wolfsburg 6-1 away, Eintracht Frankfurt beat St. Pauli 2-1, Werder Bremen defeated second-division Heidenheim 4-1, and Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf won 2-1 against second-division Erzgebirge Aue.\n\nHertha Berlin defeated second-division Dynamo Dresden 5-4 on penalties. Hertha defender Jordan Torunarigha scored in injury time of extra time to level the game 2-2 and send it to the penalty shootout.\n\nThird-division Kaiserslautern and fourth-tier side SC Verl had shootout wins over second-division sides Nuremberg and Holstein Kiel, respectively.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nCiar\u00e1n Fahey on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cfaheyAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Julian Brandt struck twice as Borussia Dortmund came from behind to beat Bundesliga leader Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach 2-1 in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ciar\u00e1n Fahey"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/germany_soccer_cup_24863_c0-50-2000-1216_s1200x700.jpg?24c26112f792c8ec696b581678d48ee653fd5a50", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
