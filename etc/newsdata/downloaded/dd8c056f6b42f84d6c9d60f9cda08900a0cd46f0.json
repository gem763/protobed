Analysts had expected an increase of 1.4 million barrels, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nThe weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) report is due at 10:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday.\n\nThe EIA said on Tuesday U.S. crude production is expected to rise by 1.27 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019 to a record 12.26 million bpd, slightly above its previous forecast for a rise of 1.25 million bpd.\n\nOutput in 2020 is forecast to rise by 910,000 bpd to 13.17 million bpd, according to the EIA, lower than its previous estimate of a rise of 990,000 bpd to 13.23 million bpd.", "description": "Oil prices slipped for a third consecutive session on Wednesday as the prospect of the United States and China striking a trade deal in talks this week dimmed, raising uncertainties for global economic growth and oil demand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106140559-1568976351423gettyimages-1169765396.jpeg?v=1570584412", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
