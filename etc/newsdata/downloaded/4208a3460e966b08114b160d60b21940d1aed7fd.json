He did also leave the door open to further rate cuts in order to maintain the expansion, although this is the same language we\u2019ve heard over and over again.\n\nWhile investors are demanding more easing from the Fed in order to fend off the risk of recession, the central bank will be pleased with the progress made and continues to stress further calls will be made meeting by meeting, with monetary policy not on a set path. In other words, it is still reluctant to accept that this is an easing cycle, rather than a mid-cycle adjustment.\n\nTeam Boris steps up PR offensive\n\nThe Brexit show is as erratic and confusing as ever, with leaks on Tuesday giving the impression that any hope of a deal is doomed due to the inflexibility of the EU side. Naturally, any leak of this nature is going to be largely posturing with a sprinkle of truth, with the rest of us left to decipher which is which.\n\nTraders were initially reluctant to be drawn in but eventually conceded, with the pound reluctantly heading south before finding support around 1.22. The fact is we\u2019ve seen negotiations like this repeatedly and while everyone is taking no-deal much more seriously than in the past, there still seems to be a belief that it will be avoided, either via an eleventh hour deal or an extension. That won\u2019t stop the next few weeks being a wild ride though.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nGBP/USD Daily Chart\n\nGold briefly buoyed by Fed easing hopes\n\nGold was buoyed on Tuesday by the prospect of more stimulus but this has quickly run its course, with the yellow metal once again running into resistance before trading lower today. Despite last week\u2019s surge, gold continues to look vulnerable although the bulls are putting up quite a fight.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nGold Daily Chart\n\nlanguishes near summer lows\n\nOil prices remain sensitive to market sentiment and trade talks later this week. continues to trade around its summer lows despite the rebound late last week as hopes ahead of the negotiations in Washington fade before they even begin. Trump\u2019s decision to add 28 Chinese companies to its entity list ahead of the talks doesn\u2019t exactly fill anyone with optimism, which means a prolonged trade war, lower growth and greater risks of recession. Not ideal at a time when demand growth fears are dragging oil prices lower.\n\nDaily Chart\n\nBrent Daily Chart\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nEconomic Calendar\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Craig Erlam) covering: GBP/USD, XAU/USD, Gold Futures, Brent Oil Futures.
