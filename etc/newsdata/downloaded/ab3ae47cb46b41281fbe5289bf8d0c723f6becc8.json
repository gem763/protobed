Work is expected to begin in January.\n\nThe biggest question mark in Sherwood\u2019s view is Congress, which has yet to decide whether to fully fund the program. \u201cThe obstacles are not really technical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt depends on the speed of the procurement and the budget behind it.\u201d\n\nSome of the most influential lawmakers don\u2019t seem inclined to support the timeline.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano (D-N.Y.), who chairs the House subcommittee that funds NASA, said moving up the moon landing by four years is merely motivated by politics.\n\nGetting Americans back to the moon more quickly has been a top talking point for President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the world are upon us. We cannot afford to fail,\u201d Serrano said at a hearing last week. \u201cTherefore I believe it is better to use your original NASA schedule of 2028 in order to have a successful, safe and cost effective mission for the benefit of the American people and the world.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Sherwood says the Blue Origin team is prepared to swiftly get to work on a goal that virtually all observers agree is a primary step in developing the economic potential of space and advancing human exploration into deep space.\n\n\u201cAll paths to developing space go through the moon. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on it,\u201d Sherwood said, adding that Blue Origin began working on its Blue Moon lunar lander before Trump announced his lunar ambitions. \u201cThere\u2019s an inevitability to need to be operating on the lunar surface that I think is clear.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/85/3cbf705c400bb7e5269ebd77ca89/191022-jeff-bezos-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
