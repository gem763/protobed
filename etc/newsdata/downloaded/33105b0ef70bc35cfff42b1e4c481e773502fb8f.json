A hundred thousand ordered to evacuate. A major highway through Los Angeles closed for most of the day, as hills above burned.\n\nWildfire season in California is disrupting daily life and highlighting the weaknesses of official responses to climate disasters even in a wealthy and technologically advanced state.\n\nAt least two people are feared to have died in fires on the outskirts of Los Angeles on Friday. In the Saddleridge fire, to the north of the city, fire officials said 13 buildings were destroyed, many probably homes. Another 18 were damaged. To the east of the city, a fire that swept through a mobile home park in Calimesa left 74 buildings destroyed and 16 damaged.\n\nThe fires in Los Angeles burned as power was restored to most of the nearly 2 million residents in the northern part of the state disconnected by Pacific Gas & Electric on Wednesday, seeking to prevent a repeat of the past two years, when its equipment sparked deadly, destructive fires during windy weather.\n\nThe power blackouts, which hit parts of the San Francisco Bay Area, put medically vulnerable people at risk, highlighted the lack of preparation by city governments for helping at-risk residents, and prompted Governor Gavin Newsom to criticize PG&E for \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201cmismanagement\u201d.\n\nThe region has been on high alert as powerful Santa Ana winds bring dry desert air to a desiccated landscape that only needs a spark to erupt. Fire officials have warned that they expect more intense and devastating wildfires due, in part, to climate change.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hillsides between homes in the Porter Ranch area of Los Angeles are left charred on Friday.

It spread west through tinder-dry brush in hilly subdivisions on the outskirts of Los Angeles, the nation\u2019s second-largest city, and was only 13% contained on Friday night.\n\nA middle-aged man who was near the fire went into cardiac arrest and died after apparently trying to fight the fire himself, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles fire chief, Ralph M Terrazas, said he flew over the fire and saw \u201chundreds, if not thousands of homes\u201d with charred backyards where firefighters had just managed to halt the flames.\n\nFire swept down the hill across the street, Bernard said, and spat embers over his home of 30 years, sizzling dry grass and igniting trees and bushes. He and his wife scrambled to go, leaving behind medication, photo albums and their four cats.\n\n\u201cIt was a whole curtain of fire,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cThere was fire on all sides. We had to leave.\u201d\n\nBernard\u2019s home and the cats survived. His backyard was charred.\n\nLois Beckett (@loisbeckett) Driving into Los Angles tonight. pic.twitter.com/IFt4ZGhl9I\n\nBy late Friday, the winds had subsided but the National Weather Service still warned of extreme fire danger in some southern areas because of very low humidity.\n\nInterstate 5, the main north-south corridor, was shut down for much of Friday. Even after motorists returned in the evening, patches of the hills remained on fire.\n\nJonathan Stahl was driving home to Valencia when he saw the smoke. He immediately diverted to a mobile home park in Sylmar, east of Los Angeles, where his grandmother and aunt live together. The park was nearly wiped out in 2008 when one of the city\u2019s most destructive fires leveled 500 homes.\n\nStahl helped his grandmother, Beverly Stahl, 91, and his aunt pack clothing, medication and their two dogs. They saw flames in the distance as they drove away.\n\n\u201cWe just packed up what we could as fast as we could,\u201d Stahl said at an evacuation point at the Sylmar Recreation Center, massaging his grandmother\u2019s shoulders as she sat in a wheelchair with a Red Cross blanket on her lap. \u201cIf we\u2019d stuck around, we would have been in trouble. Real big trouble.\u201d\n\nSeveral residents of the park were unaccounted for. The family of 89-year-old Lois Arvickson feared she died in the blaze that destroyed her home. Arvickson had called her son to say she was evacuating.\n\n\u201cShe said she\u2019s getting her purse and she\u2019s getting out, and the line went dead,\u201d Don Turner said.\n\nHe said neighbors saw his mother in her garage as flames approached. They later saw the garage on fire. Her car was still parked in the driveway.", "description": "Two people feared dead and numerous buildings destroyed as 100,000 evacuated but utility restores power to many consumers", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e2f1a28bf0360aed0802e8a8aa7e6b4ec75d256/0_121_2710_1626/master/2710.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=455b29a3b64ca84bc77e198b8c67511c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
