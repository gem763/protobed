His public renunciation of past abuses drew a line between his administration and those of his predecessors, as did the appointment of former dissidents and large numbers of women to senior roles.\n\nAbiy said: \u201cI am so humbled and thrilled ... thank you very much. It is a prize given to Africa, given to Ethiopia, and I can imagine how the rest of Africa\u2019s leaders will take it positively to work on peace-building process in our continent.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pro-Abiy rally in Addis Ababa in June 2018.

While the other Nobel prize laureates are announced in Stockholm, the peace prize is awarded in the Norwegian capital, Oslo.\n\nLast year the award \u2013 a gold medal, a diploma and SKr9m (\u20ac828,000) \u2013 went to two people fighting sexual violence: Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynaecologist, and Nadia Murad, a Yazidi activist.\n\nAccording to the Nobel peace prize website, 301 candidates were put forward for this year\u2019s award. The committee does not disclose the names of nominees until 50 years have passed.\n\nAbiy, 43, a former military officer specialising in cyber intelligence, has forged a reputation as a daring leader prepared to take risks to tackle decades-old problems.\n\nThe peace deal with Eritrea surprised and delighted tens of millions of people across east Africa. The conflict had cost both countries dearly in lives and scarce resources, and was a brake on development across much of the volatile region.\n\nMore recently Abiy played a key role in brokering a political deal in neighbouring Sudan that halted a slide into chaotic violence after the fall of the veteran dictator Omar al-Bashir while retaining many of the gains made by pro-democracy protesters.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Abiy Ahmed addresses delegates during the signing of Sudan\u2019s power sharing deal on Khartoum in August.

Residents who once feared speaking publicly about politics now talk of little else. Flags and symbols long banned by the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front fly across the city.\n\nOther initiatives, such as the planting of millions of trees, have won further international support and sympathy.\n\nBorn in western Ethiopia, Abiy joined the resistance against the regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam as a teenager before enlisting in the armed forces, reaching the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He has a doctorate in peace and security studies.\n\nAfter a stint running Ethiopia\u2019s cyber-intelligence service, he entered politics eight years ago and rose rapidly up the ranks of the Oromo faction of the EPRDF, which has historically been at odds with the Tigrayans.\n\nAnalysts say Abiy\u2019s mixed Christian and Muslim background and his fluency in three of the country\u2019s main languages help him leader to bridge communal and sectarian divides.\n\nDino Mahtani, a deputy director of International Crisis Group\u2019s Africa programme, said: \u201cAbiy\u2019s award is a reflection of the west\u2019s hope for transformational change in Ethiopia. But peace in Ethiopia is under threat by outbreaks of violence following Abiy\u2019s political liberalisation project that, despite all its good intentions, has also contributed to unleashing centrifugal political forces in the country.\n\n\u201cAbiy must develop plans to channel the demands of his people and deliver well thought-out policies to put some of these genies, such as mass human displacement, back into the box.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Guardian shortly after Abiy survived an apparent assassination attempt in 2018, one personal acquaintance of Abiy\u2019s said the leader was \u201calways looking ahead for the future\u201d. Former colleagues said shelves of books on religion, philosophy and science filled Abiy\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHe is physically active and very well organised ... He did not have a secretary because he wanted his office to be accessible. His office door was literally never closed,\u201d one said.", "description": "Award recognises efforts for peace, in particular in resolving Eritrea border conflict", "authors": ["Jason Burke", "Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51abc53fd475a670f50d1a682876d82fa823b9a/0_137_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0dc094a5ed116e655175f02699c27676", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
