She stopped at a red light and Valente Saavedra pulled up next to her. \u201cHe had speakers on his bike,\u201d says Isla. \u201cI\u2019d always wanted to listen to music on my bike, but I was too scared of wearing headphones when I was cycling on the roads. I said: \u2018Good idea,\u2019 in Spanish.\u201d\n\nThe lights changed and she cycled off, but Valente caught up with her. They stopped at a roundabout, about to go off in separate directions. Valente asked her name, saying he would add her on Facebook.\n\nWhat did she like about him? \u201cHe was definitely an interesting character. He was listening to quite heavy music; he had earrings and sunglasses. I was attracted to the strangeness of him, maybe.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI guess he looked different.\u201d Valente says he was \u201creally nervous, because I had to go to my school and I was late, but I saw Isla and I thought: \u2018Oh wow, she\u2019s beautiful. School can wait, no problem.\u2019\u201d He was delighted she spoke Spanish, although he assumed she was a tourist and would be leaving in a week or so. Did he plan to see her again? \u201cI thought: \u2018I need to say something. I need to ask her name and her number.\u2019\u201d\n\nIsla got to her school and told her friend about the man she had met. \u201cI felt it was something out of the ordinary. I wasn\u2019t looking for anything. I had just come out of a long relationship, but it just sort of happened.\u201d\n\nThe next night, Isla and her friends, including the one she had told about Valente, were at a bar. The friend spotted him. \u201cI said: \u2018Oh my God \u2013 it\u2019s the boy on the bike,\u2019\u201d says Isla. \u201cIt was a strange coincidence. I was really excited. And I was a bit drunk as well.\u201d\n\nShe approached him; Valente says he was \u201creally surprised\u201d. He was with a friend he had already told about meeting Isla. \u201cI was on the dancefloor and Isla is in front of me, really excited.\u201d He had added her on Facebook the day they met. \u201cI sent her a sticker \u2013 of two cats on a motorbike. Isla said: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you write to me?\u2019 I said: \u2018I did \u2013 I sent a sticker.\u2019 She said: \u2018No, that\u2019s not writing.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey talked for a couple of hours \u2013 about music, film, their interests \u2013 then Valente invited her back to his friend\u2019s house. She went, but soon left. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it all to happen that night. I went home and the next day he messaged me inviting me to his house.\u201d A few months later, she says: \u201cValente said: \u2018I never asked you, by the way \u2013 do you want to be my girlfriend?\u2019 We were together, but I guess we became official.\u201d\n\nIsla\u2019s contract with the school finished in August, but she stayed on in Mexico because of Valente. They moved in together about a year ago. \u201cWe\u2019re not really sure what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go back to stay with my family in Sussex in November for a few months, then Valente has to come back to Mexico because he\u2019s part of a dance company and they\u2019re doing a tour. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen; we don\u2019t really talk about it because every time we do it\u2019s a bit stressful.\u201d\n\nOne of the things she likes about Valente, she says, is that \u201che just gets up and goes. If Valente says he\u2019s going to do something, he does it, usually straight away. He\u2019s really creative and funny. I just feel really comfortable around him, that I can say and do anything. I really feel that I\u2019m myself with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very energetic,\u201d says Valente. \u201cHer energy is like a bomb. She is always suggesting things to do. I can discover different things about myself.\u201d\n\nIt was such a chance meeting, says Isla. \u201cThe window of opportunity in which we met was really a few seconds. If the light had been green, we probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d Valente must be pleased to have decided to catch up with her once she sped off, I say. He smiles and says: \u201cOn her birthday, I gave her a new bicycle.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
