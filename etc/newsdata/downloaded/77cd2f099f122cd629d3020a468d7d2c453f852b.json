This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and 'packing' - how things fit together. Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour.

Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water. Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae grows on the plastic.

The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain Richard Germain/RPS 6/9 Calmness of Eternity Himalayas mountains, Nepal.

They then watched the effect on people's epigenetic clock, to understand the effect on how they aged.\n\nThe epigenetic clock is measured by the epigenome in the body. As people age, chemical modifications or tags are added to people's DNA, and those change throughout their life \u2013 so by looking at those tags, a person's biological age can be measured.\n\nResearchers had actually intended to look at how the growth hormone would change the tissue in the thymus gland, which helps with the body's immune functions and sits in the chest. It normally shrinks after puberty but they hoped to see whether it could be pushed to regrow, by giving participants the growth hormone.\n\nIt was only as a secondary consideration that researchers then checked how the drugs changed their epigenetic clocks. The study had finished when the analysis began.\n\nProfessor Horvath then looked at four different measures of the epigenetic clock to understand the differing ages of each of the patients. And he found that every one of them had reversed significantly \u2013 so significantly that he is optimistic about the results, despite the limited number of participants.\n\nScientists now hope to test the same effects with more people, through a controlled study, and with different age groups, ethnicities and with women.\n\nThe changes could still be seen in the blood of six participants who provided their blood, long after the study finished.\n\nSome of the drugs used in the cocktail are already being researched as ways of fighting age-related diseases. But the discover of the effect of the three of them could have major implications for the ways that a variety of different drugs are tested, scientists say.", "description": "Scientists might be able to reverse process of ageing,\u00a0a new study may suggest.
