That\u2019s what lobbying is, and her idea that it\u2019s somehow evil is just wrong. It\u2019s a basic constitutional right.\u201d\n\nThe Warren campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOther scholars echoed von Spakovsky\u2019s concerns. Michael Barone, a resident fellow at the pro-free market American Enterprise Institute, said he could \u201csee an argument that says this proposal would penalize the exercise of First Amendment rights,\u201d comparing it to \u201ca confiscatory tax on newspaper.\u201d Trevor Burrus, a research fellow for the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s constitutional studies center, concurred, saying \u201cSen. Warren has essentially proposed a tax on that fundamental right.\u201d He accused the Democratic presidential hopeful of attempting to \u201csquelch political speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe pushed for stricter regulations on banks and home loans, and then pushed\u2014\u2019lobbied\u2019 one might say\u2014for the creation of the CFPB,\u201d Burrus said. \u201cIn short, Warren apparently believes in lobbying when she does it, or when it is done for causes she believes in. Her lobbying tax proposal would very likely be declared unconstitutional. The Constitution doesn\u2019t permit transparent attempts to squelch political speech.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Freebeacon.Com Politics Constitutional-Scholars-Warrens-Lobbyist-Tax-Plan-May-Violate-The-Constitution"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
