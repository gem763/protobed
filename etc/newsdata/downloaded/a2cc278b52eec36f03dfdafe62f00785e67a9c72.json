I was also opposition communications spokesman when Labor created what is now the government-owned NBN.\n\nMr Trujillo acted honourably and appropriately throughout this saga, and indeed with hindsight, the Howard government should have endorsed the original Telstra proposal.\n\nThe then Rudd government badly mishandled the tender process for the proposed broadband network, and then disastrously decided to commit billions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars to create the government-owned NBN.\n\nNone of the blame for this fiasco can be laid at the feet of Mr Trujillo.\n\nNick Minchin\n\nMelbourne, Vic\n\nShame about Steggall\u2019s choice of wheels\n\nWarringah MP Zali Steggall asks us and the Morrison government to accept the science around climate change (\u2018\u2018We need to lock a credible plan on climate into law\u2019\u2019, October 17).\n\nShe says each member of the House needs to be accountable. Curious, then, that she drives a fossil-fuelled SUV, emitting 234 grams of CO2/km. She does her credibility no favours.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Chief Scientist, Alan Finkel, author of the Finkel Review of the National Energy Market, owns two electric cars. Credible and accountable.\n\nBill Bishop\n\nPalm Beach, NSW\n\nProfits before people not the public good\n\nLiberal MP Jason Falinski marks the 75th anniversary of the Liberal Party with a call to renew the primacy of profits and to reduce regulatory restrictions on individual choice (\u201cPeople power over bureaucrats\u201d, October 18).\n\nFalinski references Adam Smith to declare that profits can only be made by offering products or services that people want, and that therefore an \u201cattack on profit is actually an attack on public good\u201d.\n\nThis is not always true. It is placing ideology above practical reality, and the results can be devastating.\n\nA simple case in point is the tobacco industry, where enormous profits are made offering fatal products that people want (even when they don\u2019t want to want them). Where is the public good there?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMitchell Browne\n\nBlaxland, NSW\n\n\u2018Loyalty penalty\u2019 goes beyond mortgages\n\nThe community should welcome an inquiry into residential mortgage pricing, particularly an examination of the differences in prices paid for the same product.\n\nOffering introductory deals is not necessarily harmful, but when the \u2018\u2018loyalty penalty\u2019\u2019 results in large price gaps and affects many people, it does not align with the community\u2019s notion of fairness. It not only drives up the cost of living for many, it can particularly harm the vulnerable who lack the capability to shop around.\n\nThe new Consumer Data Right (CDR) is designed to promote intermediaries such as FinTech providers to help connect better deals with consumers. This may assist, but we should also be aware of potential limitations. Like disclosure, it is unlikely to be sufficient for all customers to benefit. Moreover, the CDR may result in more targeted offers towards individuals, those more likely to engage and be profitable for providers.\n\nThe ACCC should also be tasked to look beyond mortgages, as the loyalty penalty is unfortunately a phenomenon that affects too many essential service markets.\n\nGerard Brody, CEO\n\nConsumer Action Law Centre\n\nTwo choices of how to tackle drought\n\nThere appears to be neither a wider understanding of the causes of our present drought-like conditions nor where the future might take us. We face the possibility that major regions of traditional farming west of the Great Dividing Range will become uninhabitable. There are two alternative paths forward.\n\nThe first one is represented by Professor John Williams at the ANU. He holds that attempts to \u2018\u2018drought-proof\u2019\u2019 Australia are a fallacy that will destroy the country. This is an arid continent. You have to accept its nature and learn to live within it, which means farming in the fertile coastal crescent.\n\nThe second one is proposed by Professor Ashish Sharma at the UNSW. \u201cWe are going to need re-engineering on a massive scale in some places if we are to continue living in them. But it is possible: Arizona and California receive barely 400 millimetres of rain each year, but have engineered their water supply systems to make previously uninhabitable places liveable.\u201d\n\nWe need more discussion now.\n\nFritz Syvertsen\n\nFairlight, NSW", "description": "Climate change, STEM, NBN, neo-liberalism, 'loyalty penalty'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.335%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_65%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7778825bcefa22f1aaad3fcf6bfd67dc51c455d0", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
