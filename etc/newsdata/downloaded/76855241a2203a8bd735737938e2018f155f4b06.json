I want a gun-friendly, affordable city with good weather. Where should I retire?\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Dear Catey,\n\nI\u2019m 73 and looking for a location outside of California (I\u2019ve had enough of living there). What I would like is a gun-friendly environment with moderate temperatures and a lot of trees, which may mean a somewhat higher elevation. Need a low cost of living, as my primary source of income is Social Security.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJ.R.\n\nDear J.R.,\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in wanting to flee California in retirement \u2014 and for you, the high cost will make it hard to live anywhere in California on just your Social Security checks. Though you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a state with weather as good as you\u2019ll get in many parts of the Golden State.\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve found some affordable spots in gun-friendly states with decent weather where you can live mostly on your Social Security check. Some of them get a bit hotter than the 80s in the summer and can be chilly in winter, but most of the year, the temperatures are mild. Here are some spots to consider.\n\nBella Vista, Arkansas\n\n\n\niStock Lake Windsor\n\nArkansas has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the nation, according to CBS News, so you\u2019ll be among like-minded folks in this state. And in Bella Vista \u2014 a town of roughly 30,000 in the Ozarks -\u2014 you\u2019ll also enjoy a cost of living that\u2019s below average for the U.S. and plenty of trees (its name is Spanish for \u201cbeautiful view\u201d).\n\nPlus, you\u2019ll get \u201ccheap homes, lots of retirees, great weather\u201d as well as \u201cplenty of options for folks looking to stay active and get outdoors\u201d including \u201cseven lakes, a number of walking trails, and 36,000 acres of native streams and hardwood forests\u201d as well as a number of shooting ranges, writes Money Magazine, which put this town on its best places to retire list.\n\nThe weather here isn\u2019t as good as in many parts of California, summers are muggy and you might see snow in winter), and Money Magazine notes that \u201cthe nearest hospital, Northwest Medical Center, is in neighboring Bentonville, 10 miles away.\u201d\n\nSilver City, New Mexico\n\niStock The Big Ditch Riverwalk Park bridge in Silver City.\n\nIn its \u201cRetire Here, Not There\u201d series, MarketWatch highlighted this college town as a great place to retire, with one retiree telling us: \u201cEverybody from every walk of life has a place here. And there\u2019s always something to do.\u201d The article also highlighted a \u201cvibrant Main Street,\u201d \u201cfriendly people\u201d and interesting arts offerings.\n\nFor you, the fact that the town is nestled against the 3.3 million acre Gila National Forest is likely to be a big draw, as is the fact that New Mexico has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the nation, according to CBS News. Plus, the cost of living is well below average for the U.S. and median homes come in at only about $150,000, according to Sperling\u2019s Best Places. The town sits at 6,000 feet so the summer heat isn\u2019t as bad here as it is in other spots in New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nThe town is small (around 10,000 residents) and the airport is, too, with few flights, so many people drive roughly three hours to cities like El Paso or Tucson for larger airports. You can read about Silver City on Marketwatch here.\n\nGainesville, Georgia\n\niStock Lake Lanier.\n\nLocated on the shores of the 38,000-acre Lake Lanier and in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, this city of about 35,000 offers you plenty of opportunities to get out in nature \u2014 from kayaking on the lake to hiking through the 1,440-acre Chicopee Woods Nature Preserve, one of the state\u2019s biggest protected greenspaces.\n\nAnd AARP, which put the city on its list of 10 affordable retirement cities, noted that big perks also included \u201cfast access to the Blue Ridge Mountains and their panoramic hiking trails, lush with rivers, waterfalls, and richly diverse ecosystems,\u201d as well as proximity to \u201cthe Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests, which comprise 843 miles of trails.\u201d\n\nFor you, the state of Georgia\u2019s pro-gun stance will be appealing \u2014 Guns & Ammo calls the state one of the \u201cmost pro-gun spots in the nation\u201d \u2014 as will Gainesville\u2019s very low cost of living.\n\nPlus, the Gainesville area offers \u201ca Southern small-town feel \u2026 and a relatively pleasant climate,\u201d Sperling\u2019s Best Places writes (although summers can be hot and muggy). And while there aren\u2019t many arts and cultural offerings, you can take a trip to Atlanta (just about an hour drive) should you want more options.", "description": "Some hidden gems to consider.", "authors": ["Catey Hill"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT261_silver_ZG_20191014130932.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
