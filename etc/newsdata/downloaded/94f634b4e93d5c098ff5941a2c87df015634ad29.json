How do you not know that? You're a farmer.\"\n\nBut Abi was quick to point out that the cows behind her were standing outside in the daylight.\n\nThis Morning viewers took to Twitter to point out Lucy's obvious blunder.\n\nOne viewer asked: \"Has the argumentative vegan missed the fact the farmer is stood outside with her cows??\"\n\nAnother added: \"Does she see the cows behind that lady or...?\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nLucy then turned on Phil when he said research had shown there was not enough room on the planet to grow the plants needed to feed the world's population.\n\nShe replied: \"If you think about the fact that there are 56 billion animals killed every year. What are we feeding those animals? We are feeding them the plants, right. If we got rid of all those animals we'd make much more space.\"\n\nPhil pointed out that grain was not the best option for humans, but Lucy refused to back down.\n\nThe presenter and guest clashed again over the manner in which animals are killed.\n\nLucy said: \"Most children are taught to love animals. If they knew they were actually getting brutally slaughtered for us to eat. I think they may be quite shocked. They get their throats slit.\"\n\nAdmitting it was a contentious issue, Phil claimed \"brutal\" was an \"emotive\" word that wasn't necessarily common practise.\n\nWhen Phillip suggested they were dead first, Lucie snapped back: \"No they're not.\"\n\nThis Morning viewers were not happy with Lucy's attitude during the debate.\n\nOne viewer said: \"The problem with the vegan debate is vegans such as Lucy look down their nose at anyone who thinks differently to them. Educate! Don\u2019t be rude and assume others are stupid. Change your approach otherwise people won\u2019t take you seriously!\"\n\n\"I cannot stand Vegans, everybody is entitled to their own opinion and diet. Don't force your way onto my life,\" added another.\n\nA third said: \"Someone is coming across as incredibly patronising\"\n\n\"Nothing against this girl but she doesn't have the warmest of personalities does she,\" said a fourth.\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The former Made In Chelsea star was slammed for her 'rude' and 'patronising' responses during the This Morning debate", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20606397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen-Shot-2019-10-16-at-121315.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
