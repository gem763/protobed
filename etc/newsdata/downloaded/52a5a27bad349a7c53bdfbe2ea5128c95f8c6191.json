Earning 2500 rupees (38$) a month as a driver, Chimanial says it is not enough to feed his children. Only his son goes to school. But in a year\u2019s time, their lives are set to change.\n\n50 kilometers away is the small city of Anand, known as India\u2019s \u201csurrogacy capital\u201d. Chimanlai\u2019s wife is carrying a baby for a Japanese couple in which she will be paid 450,000 rupees, an unimaginably large amount of money for a family like theirs. Since 2004, over 500 Indian women have traveled to Anand from neighboring villages and towns to become surrogate mothers for families from nearly 30 countries. Dr Nayana Patel and her husband run Akanksha clinic, the city\u2019s only surrogacy facility.\n\nFor nine months, the surrogate mothers live away from their families. They stay at a residency provided by Patel\u2019s clinic. Wearing gowns covering their big bellies, the women pass their time by watching TV, talking on their mobile phones and chatting to each other. Some enjoy the experience and see it as break from their tough daily life, while others miss being away for so long from their husbands and children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of doing what I\u2019m doing. I don't care what the neighbors think or what my relatives think because they are not the ones who have to feed my family,\u201d Daksha, 31, Chimanlal\u2019s wife, said. With the money she will earn, she and her husband plan to build a new house and send their daughters to school.\n\nDr Patel is somewhat of an icon in the small city of Anand. I walk out of my hotel and jump into an auto rickshaw. The driver sees my cameras and assumes I've come to photography Dr Patel and her clinic. He tells me: \"behan\u201d (polite way of addressing a woman that translates into \"sister\"), almost every journalist or foreigner walking on the streets of Anand is here to meet Dr. Patel.\u201d\n\nI first saw her as she stepped out of her light gold Audi in a beautiful, sparkling sari accessorized by a large, pearl necklace. Dr Patel, a firm woman in total control of operations at her clinic, has made a name for herself by running a successful fertility in this small city which has garnered international attention. Oprah Winfrey\u2019s now-defunct talk show featured the facility in 2007, a woman Dr Patel clearly admires based on the framed photos of the U.S. daytime TV star that are on the shelves of her clinic.\n\nDaniele and Rekha are a couple from London who heard about the clinic in Anand after watching a documentary on TV. They met Dr Patel in London and wanted her to help them fulfill their lifelong dream of having a child. Soon after, they sold their restaurant business in order to fund the surrogacy treatment and flew to India. Daniele said it was very emotional for him to meet Naina, the surrogate mother, for the first time a few days before the delivery of the baby. \u201cI was very nervous, it wasn\u2019t romantic for me because I was concerned about the child as well as the surrogate\u201d he said. It has been a life changing experience for both Rekha and Daniele and they would love to share this with their daughter and tell her about the experience and their special journey to get her. Unlike Rekha and Daniele, many parents choose not to tell their child and keep it as a big secret for their entire lives. Rekha and Daniele said they were impressed with the amount of knowledge Dr.Patel had but they wished there were improved guidelines to follow that could help them to communicate better between all parties.\n\nThough some have described the clinic as an exploitative baby factory. Dr Patel disagrees: \u201cThere is nothing immoral or wrong in this. A woman is helping another woman, one who does not have the capacity to have a baby and the other who doesn\u2019t have the capacity to lead a good life. And when the end result is a lovely baby how can you say there is something wrong happening?\u201d This may satisfy many people but it leaves one thinking about two people involved in this process - one is the surrogate who is putting her physical and mental health at risk in order to fulfill her family\u2019s dreams. How is society affected when it accepts women using their bodies like this? The other is the child who is the product of this transaction. Shouldn\u2019t he/she have the right to know the identity of any/all of the people involved in that child's conception and delivery?", "description": "Surrogate mothers rest at the Akanksha hostel in Anand, a small town in Gujarat that has a reputation as India's \"surrogacy capital.\"", "authors": ["Mansi Thapliyal"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ0LGTeoS6TPcb6w2fZ5G6RrJ9wWzrqkJKaHchKTsbm6h9nFBFQc8a2VJCwuwpR-XomO147fm1UkEB5zZOJYFI2fFDqWk3KU3uMl_u-616roM"}
