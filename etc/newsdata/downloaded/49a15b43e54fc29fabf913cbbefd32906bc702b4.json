Not to mention her portraits of Julia Roberts, Meryl Streep, Pharrell, Barack Obama \u2026 the list goes on. At the Venice Film Festival, Miu Miu\u2019s short-film series, \u201cWomen\u2019s Tales,\u201d screened a documentary that puts Lacombe in front of the camera. Director Lynne Ramsay, the filmmaker behind You Were Never Really Here and We Need to Talk About Kevin, went inside Lacombe\u2019s portrait studio for the film, titled \u201cBrigitte.\u201d\n\nRamsay knows firsthand how it feels to have your photo taken by Lacombe. \u201cI hate having my photo taken.
