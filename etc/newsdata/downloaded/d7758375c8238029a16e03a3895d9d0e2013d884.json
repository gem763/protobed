(Picture: Epic Games)\n\nFortnite users attempting to play the game in the last 24 hours have been shocked to discover that the servers are down \u2013 and have been replaced by a \u2018black hole\u2019.\n\nThe game\u2019s been offline since Sunday evening, with those trying to get in to the servers faced with the blackness, and no sign of the Fortnite map at all.\n\nSo just what\u2019s happened and what is the black hole all about? Is this the end of Fortnite as we know it?\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know\u2026\n\nWhat is the Black Hole in Fortnite?\n\nThe Black Hole followed from an event which signalled the end of season X of Fortnite.\n\nThe live event \u2013 which was streamed on Twitch, YouTube, Mixer and other sources to an estimated global audience of seven million \u2013 saw everything sucked into the hole following the end of season X party.\n\nEverything has disappeared into a black hole and users aren\u2019t sure when it\u2019ll be back (Picture: Epic Games)\n\nSince then nobody\u2019s been able to get into the game \u2013 with a picture of the hole the only thing available on the livestream, and no word on when Fortnite might be up and running again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo how long will Fortnite be off for?\n\nSpeculation is rife as to when play might resume.\n\nOne dataminer, Lucas7yoshi has found references in the website\u2019s code which suggest we might have to wait until 9am on Thursday morning before it\u2019s back online.\n\nHowever that\u2019s far from certain, as Epic Games have remained quite about just what\u2019s going on and when the game might return to servers.\n\nThe makers had warned that the servers would be off for a long while following the End live event on Sunday \u2013 but gave no indication of how long they meant.\n\nWhy has Fortnite been turned off?\n\nAre we about to see Chapter 2 of Fortnite?\n\nOnce again it\u2019s not been confirmed but rumours suggest the game\u2019s been switched off ahead of a new map and a major makeover, being rebranded as Fortnite: Chapter 2.\n\nThis comes following artwork leaked from Italy that suggests it\u2019ll be entering a second chapter instead of an 11th season.\n\nWhether it will deliver a new map however remains to be seen, as the artwork suggests that Tilted Towers and the giant skeleton on the current version of the map are still very much in the game.\n\nAll the characters have new clothing though \u2013 which could be a sign that a revamp is imminent.\n\nWe\u2019ll know soon enough\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
