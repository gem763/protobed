The face of prima ballerina Maria Noel Riccetto adorned public transport all over the city ahead of her recent performance in El Sodre\u2019s production of \u201cOnegin\u201d, John Cranko\u2019s adaptation of Alexander Pushkin\u2019s novel.\n\nPerformances at the modern theater in downtown Montevideo are a sell-out, with ticket prices an affordable $25.\n\n\u201cIt costs more to go and see a film at the cinema or to a football match at the weekend,\u201d said Yebra.\n\nHowever, South American companies like El Sodre can\u2019t possibly match the salaries on offer for artists or choreographers in Europe or the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen a dancer starts to reach her best, they come here and take her off,\u201d said Yebra. \u201cFor us it\u2019s complicated because we have to be constantly on the lookout for new young talent.\u201d\n\nAll too conscious of the reality, the Uruguayan ballet authorities don\u2019t hold back young dancers who decide to leave.\n\nThey prefer to focus on those who they can get back, like Riccetto, former soloist at the American Ballet Theater and stand-in for actress Mila Kunis in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s movie \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d\n\nHer compatriot Nadia Mara, soloist at the Atlanta Ballet in the United States, also danced in this month\u2019s \u201cOnegin\u201d production, her first time dancing in front of family and friends in the audience since she left for Atlanta as a teenager.\n\nBocca is meanwhile preparing to return to the scene of his triumph. He will take on a teaching role at El Sodre next year, to do what he likes best \u2014 to teach, free of the pressures of production budgets and funding and having to fill theaters.", "description": "Montevideo (AFP) \u2013 Pirouettes and arabesques perfectly executed, dozens of dancers in a colorful assemblage of sweat pants and leotards perform an", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/f6a084_italian-ballet-dancer-deputy-artistic-uruguay-national-ballet-francesco-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
