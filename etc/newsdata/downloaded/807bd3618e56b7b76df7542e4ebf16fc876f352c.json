The Verge will update this page with news and analysis on the fires and the effects that could linger once the ash settles.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nWhy is the Amazon burning?\n\nAn unprecedented number of fires raged throughout Brazil in 2019, intensifying in August. That month, the country\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported that there were more than 80,000 fires, the most that it had ever recorded. It was a nearly 80 percent jump compared to the number of fires the country experienced over the same time period in 2018. More than half of those fires took place in the Amazon.\n\nThe number of blazes decreased in September, after president Jair Bolsonaro bowed to mounting pressure to address the flames and announced a 60-day ban on setting fires to clear land. Some exceptions were made for indigenous peoples who practice subsistence agriculture and those who\u2019ve received clearance by environmental authorities to use controlled burning to prevent larger fires.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this rise in fire activity is associated with a sharp rise in deforestation\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are intentional fires to clear the forest,\u201d Cathelijne Stoof, coordinator of the Fire Center at Wageningen University (WUR) in the Netherlands, tells The Verge. \u201cPeople want to get rid of the forest to make agricultural land, for people to eat meat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that this rise in fire activity is associated with a sharp rise in deforestation,\u201d Paulo Artaxo, an atmospheric physicist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, told Science Magazine. He explained that the fires are expanding along the borders of new agricultural development, which is what\u2019s often seen in fires related to forest clearing.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration, which had pledged to open up the Amazon to more development, has sought to shift attention away from deforestation. Bolsonaro initially pointed a finger at NGOs opposing his policies for allegedly intentionally setting fires in protest, without giving any evidence to back his claim. In August, he fired the director of the National Institute for Space Research over a dispute over data it released showing the sharp uptick in deforestation that\u2019s taken place since Bolsonaro took office. On August 20th, Brazil\u2019s Minister of the Environment Ricardo Salles tweeted that dry weather, wind, and heat caused the fires to spread so widely. But even during the dry season, large fires aren\u2019t a natural phenomenon in the Amazon\u2019s tropical ecosystem.\n\nWhy is this a big deal?\n\nEveryone on the planet benefits from the health of the Amazon. As its trees take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, the Amazon plays a huge role in pulling planet-warming greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere. Without it, climate change speeds up. But as the world\u2019s largest rainforest is eaten away by logging, mining, and agribusiness, it may not be able to provide the same buffer.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon was buying you some time that it is not going to buy anymore,\u201d Carlos Quesada, a scientist at Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Amazonian Research, told Public Radio International in 2018. Scientists warn that the rainforest could reach a tipping point, turning into something more like a savanna when it can no longer sustain itself as a rainforest. That would mean it\u2019s not able to soak up nearly as much carbon as it does now. And if the Amazon as we know it dies, it wouldn\u2019t go quietly. As the trees and plants perish, they would release billions of tons of carbon that has been stored for decades \u2014 making it nearly impossible to escape a climate catastrophe.\n\nEveryone on the planet benefits from the health of the Amazon\n\nOf course, those nearest to the fires will bear the most immediate effects. Smoke from the fires got so bad, it seemed to turn day into night in S\u00e3o Paulo on August 20th. Residents say the air quality is still making it difficult to breathe. On top of that, a massive global study on air pollution found that among the two dozen countries it observed, Brazil showed one of the sharpest increases in mortality rates whenever there\u2019s more soot in the air.\n\nAnd because fire isn\u2019t a natural phenomenon in the region, it can have outsized impacts on local plants and animals. One in ten of all animal species on Earth call the Amazon home, and experts expect that they will be dramatically affected by the fires in the short term. In the Amazon, plants and animals are \u201cexceptionally sensitive\u201d to fire, Jos Barlow, a professor of conservation science at Lancaster University in the UK, said to The Verge in an email. According to Barlow, even low-intensity fires with flames just 30 centimeters tall can kill up to half of the trees burned in a tropical rainforest.\n\nWhy is this a hot topic politically?\n\nWhen Jair Bolsonaro was campaigning for office as a far-right candidate, he called for setting aside less land in the Amazon for indigenous tribes and preservation, and instead making it easier for industry to come into the rainforest. Since his election in October 2018, Bolsonaro put the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the demarcation of indigenous territories instead of the Justice Ministry, essentially \u201cletting the fox take over the chicken coop,\u201d according to one lawmaker. His policies have been politically popular among industry and agricultural interests in Brazil, even as they\u2019ve been condemned by Brazilian environmental groups and opposition lawmakers. Hundreds of indigenous women stormed the country\u2019s capital on August 13th to protest Bolsonaro\u2019s environmental rollbacks and encroachment of development on indigenous lands. The hashtag #PrayforAmazonia blew up on Twitter.\n\nAbout 60 percent of the Amazon can be found within Brazil\u2019s borders, which gives the nation a massive amount of influence over the region. Not surprisingly, the fires have called international attention to the plight of the Amazon and have turned up the heat on Bolsonaro\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron took to Twitter to call for action, pushing for emergency international talks on the Amazon at the G7 summit. On August 26th, the world\u2019s seven largest economies offered Brazil more than $22 million in aid to help it get the fires under control. Bolsonaro promptly turned down the money, accusing Macron on Twitter of treating Brazil like a colony. Some in Brazil, including Bolsonaro, see the international aid as an attack on Brazil\u2019s sovereignty, and its right to decide how to manage the land within its borders.\n\n\u201cLetting the fox take over the chicken coop\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump, on the other hand, congratulated Bolsonaro on his handling of the fires. \u201cHe is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil,\u201d he tweeted on the 27th.\n\nBolsonaro has since said that he\u2019ll reconsider the deal, as long as Macron takes back his \u201cinsults\u201d and Brazil has control over how the money is spent. On the 27th, Bolsonaro accepted $12.2 million in aid from the UK.\n\nHow are the fires being fought?\n\nAfter weeks of international and internal pressure, Bolsonaro deployed the military to help battle the fires on August 24, sending 44,000 troops to six states. Reuters reported the next day that warplanes were dousing flames.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex operation. We have a lot of challenges,\u201d Paulo Barroso tells The Verge. Barroso is the chairman of the national forest fire management committee of the National League of Military Firefighters Corps in Brazil. He has spent three decades fighting fires in Mato Grosso, one of the regions most affected by the ongoing fires. According to Barroso, more than 10,400 firefighters are spread thin across 5.5 million square kilometers in the Amazon and \u201chotspots\u201d break out in the locations they\u2019re unable to cover.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an adequate structure to prevent, to control, and to fight the forest fires\u201d\n\nBarroso contends that they need more equipment and infrastructure to adequately battle the flames. There are 778 municipalities throughout the Amazon, but according to Barroso, only 110 of those have fire departments. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an adequate structure to prevent, to control, and to fight the forest fires,\u201d Barroso says. He wants to establish a forest fire protection system in the Amazon that brings together government entities, indigenous peoples, local communities, the military, large companies, NGOs, and education and research centers. \u201cWe have to integrate everybody,\u201d Barroso says, adding, \u201cwe need money to do this, we have to receive a great investment.\u201d\n\nBarroso and other experts agree that it\u2019s important to look ahead to prevent fires like we\u2019re seeing now. After all, August is just the beginning of Brazil\u2019s largely manmade fire season, when slashing-and-burning in the country peaks and coincides with drier weather.\n\nControlled burns are also a popular deforestation technique in other countries where the Amazon is burning, including Bolivia. There, the government brought in a modified Boeing 747 supertanker to douse the flames.\n\nUsing planes to put out wildfires in the Amazon isn\u2019t a typical method of firefighting in tropical forests, and is likely to get expensive, Lancaster University\u2019s Jos Barlow tells The Verge. He says that large-scale fires in areas cleared by deforestation \u201care best contained with wide firebreaks created with bulldozers \u2014 not easy in remote regions.\u201d If the fires enter the forest itself, they require different tactics. \u201cThey can normally be contained by clearing narrow fire breaks in the leaf litter and fine fuel,\u201d Barlow says. \u201cBut this is labour intensive over large scales, and fires need to be reached soon, before they get too big.\u201d\n\nFires that have been intentionally set, as we\u2019re seeing in Brazil, can be even more difficult to control compared to a sudden wildland fire. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to be deliberately destructive,\u201d says Timothy Ingalsbee, co-founder and executive director of Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics, and Ecology and research associate at the University of Oregon. Slashing before burning produces a lot of very dry, very flammable fuel. And at this scale, Ingalsbee calls the fires \u201can act of global vandalism.\u201d\n\nBarlow says, \u201cThe best fire fighting technique in the Amazon is to prevent them in the first place \u2014 by controlling deforestation and managing agricultural activities.\u201d\n\nWUR\u2019s Cathelijne Stoof agrees: \u201cFighting the fires is of course important now,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the longer term, it is way more important to focus on deforestation.\u201d", "description": "Record-breaking fires are ripping through the Amazon \u2014 an ecosystem on which the whole world depends.
