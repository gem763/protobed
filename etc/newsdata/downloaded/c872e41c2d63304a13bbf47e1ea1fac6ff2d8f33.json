The backlash did not go public, though, until hours later \u2014 in large part because of a summit-wide privacy policy meant to confine the information shared by industry leaders to only those who pay the $25,000 to attend.\n\nAt least three attendees refused to stay quiet, willfully violating the summit\u2019s code of conduct to expose Fisher\u2019s behavior with the hope of forcing reform upon the wealth management world \u2014 which eventually forced Roame to address the matter publicly and Fisher to respond to the criticism.\n\nAD\n\nViolating the summit\u2019s media policy was risky, attendees said, particularly in the field of wealth management. A person\u2019s credibility is wholly dependent on their ability to be discreet and keep information private. But those who spoke out said this circumstance warranted an exception.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI chose to speak out because maintaining a culture of silence around harassment and assault protects those who abuse their power, which then further marginalizes underrepresented groups,\u201d Sonya Dreizler, a speaker and consultant to financial services firms, told The Post.\n\nDreizler, who specializes in investing that delivers both financial and environmental or social justice returns, came forward after her friend and fellow summit attendee, Alex Chalekian, shared a video of himself recapping Fisher\u2019s behavior, which he called a \u201ctrue debacle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYes, I was at the Tiburon CEO Summit. Attached is my statement about Ken Fisher\u2019s comments referenced in @AlexChalekian video. pic.twitter.com/vLGaEEFc4N \u2014 Sonya Dreizler (@SonyaDreizler) October 9, 2019\n\nChalekian, founder and CEO of Lake Avenue Financial in Pasadena, Calif., said Fisher talked about dropping acid and his belief that charities are immoral. He also made crude comments about genitalia and mentioned financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges earlier this year before dying by suicide in prison, according to Chalekian and other attendees.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThings that were said by Ken Fisher were just absolutely horrifying,\u201d Chalekian said in the video.\n\nRachel Robasciotti, founder and CEO of wealth management firm Robasciotti and Philipson in San Francisco, also publicly condemned Fisher\u2019s words \u201cat great personal risk to my career,\u201d she told The Post in an interview.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf we want things to be different, we have to be different,\u201d Robasciotti said. \u201cAnd that means not condoning that kind of behavior.\"\n\nIn the days since the summit, Roame has denounced Fisher\u2019s remarks in a lengthy statement and vowed the powerful billionaire will never again be invited back to the Tiburon CEO Summit.\n\n\u201cThese comments lacked the dignity & respect that should be expected by any Tiburon CEO Summit speaker or attendee,\u201d Roame said. \u201cThese were unacceptable words at Tiburon, in the wealth & investments industry, and in society generally.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRoame also said he \u201ccommended\u201d Chalekian for \u201chaving the strength to go public.\u201d\n\nFisher has been forced to respond, too, both apologizing for and defending his words.\n\nAD\n\nIn an email to his employees at Fisher Investments that was obtained by Forbes, Fisher was dismissive of criticism from attendees and wrote that Chalekian\u2019s video \u201cmischaracterized\u201d what he said at the summit.\n\n\u201cIt attributes views to me that I neither expressed nor endorsed,\u201d Fisher wrote. \u201c \u2026 Many of you are likely familiar with my sometimes colorful means of expressing myself. I like to say whatever is on my mind. I want to you to know I am sincerely sorry if anything I\u2019ve said in your presence offended you. That certainly was never my intention.\u201d\n\nFisher was more defiant in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cI have given a lot of talks, a lot of times, in a lot of places and said stuff like this and never gotten that type of response,\u201d Fisher told Bloomberg. \u201cMostly the audience understands what I am saying.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn social media, other financial advisers and wealth managers came forward claiming they had heard Fisher make equally crass comments while speaking at previous industry summits.\n\nAt one conference in Dana Point, Calif., last year, Fisher said it was \u201cstupid\u201d to brag about financial performance in a direct mailer, according to video of the summit obtained by Bloomberg. Fisher compared that move, according to Bloomberg, \u201clike walking into a bar and you are a single guy and want to get laid and walking up to some girl and saying: \u2018Hey you want to have sex?\u2019 You just turn yourself into a jerk.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what he would have done differently in life, Fisher said he would have \u201chad more sex,\u201d according to the video.\n\nAD\n\nKen Fisher did the same thing at the EBI West conference in June 2018. I don\u2019t understand why he keeps getting invited to speak.\n\n\n\nThank you, @AlexChalekian, for speaking out. https://t.co/mDHNOR9JVd \u2014 Courtney Ranstrom (@courtranstrom) October 9, 2019\n\nFisher told Bloomberg he is an \u201ceasy guy to dislike\u201d because he manages so much wealth, adding that he regretted taking what ended up being a \u201cpain in the neck\u201d speech invitation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI wonder if anybody will be candid at one of these Tiburon events again,\u201d he told Bloomberg.\n\nRobasciotti said her critique of Fisher\u2019s behavior has nothing to do with being candid.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need political correctness, I need responsibility from the leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cNo other CEO is going to do a deal with me if they\u2019re thinking about me as a sexual object.\u201d\n\nI was in this room full of financial services CEOs when what Alex reports in this video was said - one of the most disgusting and disappointing moments in my career. https://t.co/QHLtk4ttsY \u2014 Rachel J Robasciotti (@rrobasciotti) October 9, 2019\n\nRobasciotti identifies as a black, queer woman in an industry overwhelming occupied by white men. Fisher\u2019s words, she said, and the message they reinforce are what make it more difficult for people like her to succeed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf there aren\u2019t women and people of color in the industry,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s because they don\u2019t feel welcome.\u201d\n\nShe is trying to change the work environment from the inside by hiring LGBTQ people, people of color and women and co-founding a social justice investing platform called RISE (Return on Investment and Social Equity), which has partnered with consumer activism and workplace equity groups to tackle the issue of workplace sexual harassment.\n\nAD\n\nThe initiative, called Force the Issue, is what she spoke about at the summit \u2014 just minutes after Fisher\u2019s keynote address ended. The irony, Robasciotti said, was not lost on her.\n\n\u201cThis exact issue was parallel,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:", "description": "Self-proclaimed \u201cself-made multi-billionaire\u201d Ken Fisher has been banned from future Tiburon CEO Summits.", "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zDQUNwPGdnOuZKjIwWvE3S7rPAA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/APWDF6HLWMI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
