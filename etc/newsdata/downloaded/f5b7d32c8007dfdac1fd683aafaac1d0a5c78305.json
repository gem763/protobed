REUTERS/Katherine Taylor/Files\n\nProsecutors recommended U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentence Huffman to one month behind bars after she pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy related to her payment of $15,000 to have someone secretly correct her daughter\u2019s answers on the SAT test, according to court documents.\n\nThe one-time star of the television series \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d is among 50 people accused in a scheme that involved cheating or bribery in which wealthy parents used fraud to secure their children spots at prominent U.S. universities including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California. Among those charged in \u201cOperation Varsity Blues\u201d are Huffman, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in 2005\u2019s \u201cTransamerica,\u201d and Lori Loughlin, who starred in the TV series \u201cFull House.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncarceration ... would provide just punishment for the offense, make it clear that this was a real crime, causing real harm, and reinforce the vital principle that all are equally subject to the law regardless of wealth or position,\u201d U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in pre-sentencing documents, also recommending a $20,000 fine and one year of probation.\n\nHuffman\u2019s attorneys argued in their own court documents that she is \u201cremorseful\u201d and \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d and should remain free on one year\u2019s probation, complete 250 hours of community service and pay a $20,000 fine.\n\n\u201cI find Motherhood bewildering,\u201d Huffman, 56, who is married to the actor William H. Macy, said in a letter to the judge.\n\nHer daughter, who was 4 years old when Huffman first started trying to help her deal with learning disabilities, was unaware of the cheating scheme until Huffman\u2019s arrest in March, she said.\n\n\u201cMy daughter looked at me and asked with tears streaming down her face, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you believe in me? Why didn\u2019t you think I could do it on my own?\u2019 ... I have compromised my daughter\u2019s future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity,\u201d Huffman said in her letter.\n\nShe said the cheating scheme was proposed by William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, a California college admissions consultant.\n\nSinger pleaded guilty in March to charges he helped bribe university sports coaches to present clients\u2019 children as fake athletic recruits. His sentencing was set for later this month.", "description": "Actress Felicity Huffman, the first parent to be sentenced in a wide-ranging college admissions scandal, faces prison time on Friday for admittedly paying to rig her daughter's entrance exam.", "authors": ["Valerie Vande Panne", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429401051&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0U7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
