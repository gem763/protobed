Residents and divers said a tragedy of such scale seemed unimaginable.\n\nThe diving tour boat erupted in flames along the coast of Santa Barbara at around 3.15am on Monday and ultimately sank. Five crew members escaped and were rescued but 33 passengers and another crew member were found dead or were still missing, with little hope of good news.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless. We are all thinking that could\u2019ve been us,\u201d said Ralph Clevenger, a Santa Barbara photographer and diver who has taken photos for Truth Aquatics, the local company that owns the 75ft boat.\n\n\u201cI was trying to recall in the world an event of this scale in the industry. I can\u2019t think of anything. The death toll is just unheard of. This is a complete shock.\u201d\n\nCalifornia boat fire: 25 dead after blaze off Santa Cruz Island Read more\n\nLaw enforcement officials released minimal information, saying those killed came from across California and that DNA testing would likely be needed to identify some of the bodies.\n\nNyx Cangemi, a US coast guard official, told the Guardian late on Monday authorities had recovered 20 bodies and five had been seen inside the boat but were not immediately reachable.\n\nThe US Coast Guard on Tuesday suspended the search, after seven missions with helicopter crews over roughly 24 hours failed to detect signs of any additional people.\n\nIt is presumed that the nine remaining people have also died, Capt Monica Rochester told reporters.\n\nAuthorities said it was likely the passengers had all been asleep, in tight quarters below deck, when the disaster struck and that it appeared they became trapped by the fire. \u201cThis is probably the worst-case scenario,\u201d said the Santa Barbara county sheriff, Bill Brown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The burned out boat Conception off the north side of Santa Cruz Island on Monday.

The victims included a 17-year-old and people in their 60s, and many were from the Santa Cruz and San Jose area in northern California, he said.\n\nThirty families have been in contact with the sheriff\u2019s office, while relatives of four others have not yet connected with investigators.\n\nFamily members identified one of the missing as Kristy Finstad, a 41-year-old marine biologist who was leading the three-day Labor Day weekend diving expedition on the boat, the Conception.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so enthusiastic, and she shared that, and I always learned something from her,\u201d said Cathy Corbett, a longtime diver who has been on numerous Truth Aquatics trips led by Finstad. Corbett recalled meeting her for the first time about four years ago: \u201cShe had this smiley face and bright eyes \u2026 it was one of the best dive weekends I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s just such a huge, profound loss in our diving community.\u201d\n\nFinstad was dedicated to teaching participants about science, she added: \u201cKristy took it to a whole different level.\u201d\n\nA couple who helped rescue survivors told reporters the crew members who escaped were injured and distraught. One talked about celebrating a 17-year-old girl\u2019s birthday hours before the fire.\n\nPacific Collegiate School, a high school in Santa Cruz, said there were \u201cstudents and parents\u201d on board, but it has not said how many and has not released further details.\n\n\u201cThis is such a small community, and I have relatives who dive,\u201d said Orlando Aldana, a 42-year-old Santa Barbara resident who feared he might have known some of the victims. As the search went on and the body count rose, he said he was relieved that he had not received any news about friends or family.\n\nPlay Video 1:05 California boat fire kills at least 25 people \u2013 video report\n\nBut the number of casualties and the way they died was tough to process, said Aldana, who came to the Santa Barbara harbor with 34 candles.\n\n\u201cIf the boat went up in flames, you\u2019d think they would jump in the water,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must have been trapped. They couldn\u2019t get to the exit.\u201d\n\nAt a makeshift memorial, Pedro Lopez, a pastor at Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Barbara, dropped off a bouquet of flowers. He said the deaths had been terrifying to many different communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affecting all of southern California, and certainly the community of people who use the boats,\u201d said Lopez, a fisherman. \u201cIt hits close to home. A lot of people are worried.\u201d\n\nNext time he went out in a similar vessel, he said, he would think about the layout of a boat and how he would escape if he had to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this happening,\u201d he said.\n\nDiving experts and participants in similar expeditions emphasized that this kind of fire appeared to be unprecedented.\n\nClevenger, who had been on the Conception and knows Truth Aquatics\u2019 captains and its owner, Glen Fritzler, said crew members were well-trained professionals, some of the best in the business.\n\n\u201cThey were incredibly serious about safety,\u201d he said. \u201cThe owner works on the boat personally and his crews are trained so well and very impressive. That\u2019s what makes this even more tragic.\u201d\n\nInvestigators did not immediately share information about what might have caused the fire, but they said the boat was in compliance with all regulations and had received annual inspections.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A former Truth Aquatics crewman, James Miranda, prays and drops flowers into the water at the moorings where the boat was based in Santa Barbara, California.
