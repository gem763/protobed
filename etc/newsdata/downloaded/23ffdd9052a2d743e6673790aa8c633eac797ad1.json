(Photo By Vaughn Ridley/Sportsfile via Getty Images)\n\nMembers of the deal team at Canopy Rivers Inc. (RIV.V) look at about seven investment opportunities a day, getting to know cannabis entrepreneurs eager for financial backing in a sector where the stigma of illegal drugs lingers.\n\nThe Toronto-based venture-capital arm of Canopy Growth Corp. (WEED.TO)(CGC) reviewed 1,523 pitches in the last 365 days, according to chief executive officer Narbe Alexandrian. His discerning Shark Tank judge-like investment scouts have inducted only 18 companies into the company\u2019s current diversified portfolio.\n\n\u201cWe have a database of every company that we\u2019ve interacted with,\u201d Alexandrian told Yahoo Finance Canada. \u201cThat whole process and system comes from the Silicon Valley world of investing, which I ported when I came from OMERS Ventures.\u201d\n\nHis tenure at the prominent technology venture-capital fund made him a natural choice for an outfit created in part by former Canopy Growth co-chief executive Bruce Linton, himself a convert to cannabis from the tech sector.\n\nCanopy Rivers was founded in April 2017 with the goal of investing in companies the Smiths Falls, Ont.-based cannabis giant couldn\u2019t swallow. Today, it\u2019s leveraging those talks with entrepreneurs to suss out global opportunities and think beyond dried flower.\n\nVenture-capital investment in Canada soared to a record high of $2.15 billion in the first half of 2019, according to the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association\u2019s (CVCA) latest report. Cannabis has been no exception.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a doubling in both the amount of money going in, but also in the number of deals taking place,\u201d Alexandrian said.\n\n\u201cAs investors are coming in, they are going after more established companies rather than the brand new startups. That generally shows that you are getting closer to maturation. You\u2019re still far away from it, but you are seeing the maturing of the market taking place right in front of you.\u201d\n\nFor Canopy Rivers in its fiscal first quarter, that meant deploying $18.8 million into a trio of new investments in step with the firm\u2019s vision of what lies ahead for the sector. Three \u201careas where the puck is headed,\u201d or the three Alexandrian is willing to discuss publicly, are biosynthetics, plant science and brands.\n\nBiosynthetic cannabinoid production eliminates the need for greenhouses and cultivation. The potentially disruptive technology involves using living cells like bacteria, algae or yeast to generate cannabinoids.\n\nAlexandrian believes lab-created cannabinoids will be the future of the pharma industry, given the technology\u2019s ability to produce a consistent active pharmaceutical ingredient. The technology is being closely studied by Organigram Inc. (OGI.TO)(OGI) and Cronos Group Inc. (CRON.TO)(CRON). Canopy Rivers is still looking at investment options.\n\nOn the plant science front, the firm recently bet on ZeaKal Inc., a California-based company with research and development ties to Corteva Inc. (CTVA), an agriscience division spun-out from DowDuPont. Canopy Rivers announced a US$10 million investment in the company in June for an 8.7 per cent ownership stake, calling the move a \u201cgame changer\u201d given ZeaKal\u2019s proprietary technology to improve plant yield by increasing photosynthesis.\n\nWhen it comes to brands, Alexandrian said he looks for companies that \u201cdon\u2019t treat cannabis like a Sears catalogue,\u201d meaning they tell a story to the target consumer, rather than simply exist on a shelf or in an online store.\n\nCanopy Rivers invested US$2.5 million in California-based High Beauty Inc., a brand producing non-psychoactive products aimed at consumers looking for natural and organic offerings.\n\nAlexandrian is also eyeing opportunities to import successful U.S. brands north of the border.\n\n\u201cWe do see a large arbitrage opportunity for bringing U.S. brands to Canada. Seeing that they are able to freely market and the internet doesn\u2019t have any borders, you can bring the brand here, put it on shelves and leverage off the branding in the U.S. without the two companies touching each other,\u201d he said.\n\nBig changes are underway in cannabis investing that mirror the technology sector in the early 2000s, he said, including a shift away from vertically integrated companies taking cannabis from seeds to retail.\n\n\u201cOur thesis has been and will be for the next little while that vertical integration doesn\u2019t work unless you have $4 billion in cash like Canopy Growth,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, a lot of companies are doing everything themselves because they can\u2019t trust partners around them. Slowly that is going to horizontal integration, which is let\u2019s do one thing and one thing very well.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "Members of the deal team at Canopy Rivers Inc. look at about seven investment opportunities per day, getting to know cannabis entrepreneurs eager for financial backing in a sector where the stigma of illegal drugs lingers.", "authors": ["Jeff Lagerquist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/d.KJYf0wkwj60Hhp5R.Wgg--~B/aD0zMTM0O3c9NDY1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/65032250-cfe7-11e9-adfd-7510f847096d", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
