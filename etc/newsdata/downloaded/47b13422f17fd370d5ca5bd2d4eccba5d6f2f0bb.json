On Sunday, the People's Liberation Army raised a yellow warning flag at its garrison in Hong Kong as dozens of people protested outside the site.\n\nThe protests, which show no sign of abating, pose the biggest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, walks away after giving a press conference on Tuesday.

Services would also end at 8 pm (1200 GMT), more than four hours earlier than normal, it said.\n\nThe metro system was shut down in an unprecedented move on Friday night after protesters set stations on fire and attacked ticket machines. Only limited services were in operation over the weekend.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said in a statement early on Tuesday that \"a large group of masked rioters repeatedly committed destructive acts extensively\", including \"dropping a bicycle from height\" that hit and injured a police officer. Roads were also blocked in various districts, it said.\n\nATMs, Chinese banks and scores of shops were vandalised while many restaurants and malls closed early.\n\nProtesters daubed walls with graffiti condemning the police and streets were left littered with broken bricks and metal barricades from the clashes, during which police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to subdue the protesters.\n\nThe protests that started to oppose a now-withdrawn extradition bill and drew more than a million onto the streets, have grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's increasing grip on the city since it reverted to Chinese control in 1997.\n\nChina has accused foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment.", "description": "City's chief executive says protests 'no longer peaceful', after weekend of violence and targeted attacks on businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/8/bb72806c7c44441cb0728ed12dca7c05_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
