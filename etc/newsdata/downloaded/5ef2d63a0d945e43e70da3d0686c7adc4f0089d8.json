Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHouston were punched in the gut during the first two games at home and walked away empty-handed despite having their two aces on the mound but responded with a win over the Washington Nationals on Friday to cut the best-of-seven deficit to 2-1.\n\n\u201cWe had something happen in Houston that doesn\u2019t happen very often, a team came in and beat us back-to-back against two of our big boys,\u201d Astros manager AJ Hinch said after their 4-1 Game Three victory.\n\n\u201cSo coming to a new venue, certainly in an unbelievable environment today, I think getting back into this series and putting a little bit of momentum in our clubhouse and our dugout will go a long way.\u201d\n\nThe Astros needed no reminder of what was at stake on Friday having been asked at every turn about the importance of Game Three given that none of the 24 teams to fall behind 3-0 in a World Series have rallied back to win.\n\nHouston, who entered the postseason as the consensus choice to win it all, suddenly looked more like the team that dominated the regular season with key pitches and a steady presence on the basepaths and capitalizing their opportunities.\n\n\u201cI just liked the competitiveness of our at-bats,\u201d said Hinch. \u201cWe were kind of pretty focused on handing the baton to the next guy, which is really important. We\u2019re at our best when we do that.\u201d\n\nMichael Brantley drove in a pair of runs for Houston on a night when Astros\u2019 starting pitcher Zack Greinke allowed seven hits, three walks and one run in 4-2/3 innings.\n\nHouston will turn the ball over to Jose Urquidy for Game Four on Saturday.\n\n\u201cObviously we used a lot of resources tonight but this is the World Series were are going to keep going at it,\u201d said Hinch.\n\n\u201cJose Urquidy\u2019s been really good for us. He\u2019s started a little bit, he\u2019s been in the pen. We are going to turn the ball over to him in the first inning and give him an opportunity to go as deep as he can.\u201d", "description": "It turns out the Houston Astros just needed a change of scenery to breathe new life into the World Series.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445100733&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P04O-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
