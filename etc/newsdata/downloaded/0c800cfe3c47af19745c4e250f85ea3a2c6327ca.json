Muslim parents in the UK pulled hundreds of children out of school, forcing a shutdown of recently-implemented LGBT programming. And as I reported back in February, students are pushing back, signing petitions demanding the return of their gender-segregated bathrooms and even suing their high schools in order to retrieve their right to privacy.\n\nLast week, the debate erupted again in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Two groups of students staged a walkout at Abraham Lincoln High School over bathroom privacy, with the protest being sparked by a girl who stated that her privacy was violated by a biological male who \u201crecently began to identify as a girl\u201d using the female bathroom. She was joined by about twenty other high school girls who left the school at 10:30 AM and began \u201cchanting for privacy in restrooms, saying they don\u2019t want boys transitioning into being girls to be in the restroom with them.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that much of the transgender ideology is so new that if someone had predicted high school girls would be fighting to keep biological males out of their bathrooms ten years ago, LGBT activists would have accused those making these predictions of fearmongering, bigotry, and deceit. Now, of course, if you defend the right of young girls to be uncomfortable with penises in their bathrooms and change rooms, you are guilty of transphobia. Some trans activists have gone so far as to say that girls uncomfortable changing in the presence of biological boys need to get over their internalized transphobia.\n\nThe 20 girls demanding privacy were confronted by nearly 40 students of mixed gender chanting in favor of state law, which requires schools to allow students to use whichever bathroom they feel most comfortable with, irrespective of the feelings of female students. Many of the girls made their feelings crystal clear.\n\nFollow Jonathon van Maren on Facebook\n\n\u201cWe felt very uncomfortable with a male who\u2019s not doing anything to be transgender going into female restrooms,\u201d said Elana Owens. \u201cI believe if you have the male parts you go to the males\u2019 bathroom and if you have the female parts you go to a ladies room and that\u2019s just the way I was raised,\u201d added Brandi Scherlund, almost in tears. Those supporting the so-called right of biological males to use the female bathroom stated that the law is on their side.\n\nIn response to the student walkouts, Superintendent of the Council Bluffs Community School District Dr. Vickie Murillo stated that, \u201cAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, which Iowa has adopted that same language and is now part of our state law, our students who are transitioning into a new gender have the right to use the restroom that they identify with. So it is our obligation to allow that to occur.\u201d\n\nMurillo did not address the contention of one female student, who noted that there was a biological male making no effort to physically transition joining them in their bathroom. Abraham Lincoln High stated that no students would be punished for the walkout.\n\nWe\u2019re going to see a lot more of these scenarios unfold as the ideology of transgender activists collides with the simple realities of human nature, including the fact that many teenage girls do not want to change in the same room with biological males, and that most people simply do not buy the idea that there are thousands of \"girls\" with penises inhabiting American high schools.\n\nPeople are also getting fed up with the new \u201chierarchy of feelings\u201d where transgender students cannot be asked to use single-stall bathrooms if they are uncomfortable using the one that matches their sex, but that instead the privacy and feelings of the girls must be sacrificed for the feelings of a few students who have been persuaded that this is their inalienable right.", "description": "I believe if you have the male parts you go to the males\u2019 bathroom and if you have the female parts you go to a ladies room.", "authors": ["Jonathon Van Maren", "Follow Jonathon"], "top_image": "https://assets.lifesitenews.com/images/made/images/remote/https_www.lifesitenews.com/images/local/Abraham_Lincoln_High_OMAHA__Neb_1024_512_75_s_c1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-15"}
