Since the paperwork was released, WeWork has suffered from a lack of investor interest, and has since announced it's shelving its plans to go public.\n\nIn the aftermath, attention turned to Neumann. Scrutiny was placed on his business investments and his complex web of personal connections within WeWork that could pose conflicts of interests. WeWork announced some changes, but it wasn't enough to get the IPO back on track.\n\nIn response, Neumann announced last month he was stepping down as CEO in the company's \"best interest,\" saying he was becoming \"a significant distraction\" to WeWork's IPO plans. He's reportedly now leaving the company's board of directors, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, and he will get $1.7 billion as part of a buyout deal to do so.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Adam Neumann, the WeWork cofounder and ousted CEO:", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about Adam Neumann, the ousted WeWork cofounder who has purchased $80 million worth of real estate.", "authors": ["Paige Leskin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7ba63e2e22af21c40abc5a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
