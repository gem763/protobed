It was sort of a nasty diatribe, not focused on the facts.\"\n\nThe White House meeting came shortly after the House voted 354 to 60 to condemn Mr. Trump's decision to pull troops from northern Syria. The only votes against the resolution came from Republicans.\n\nThe meeting also came after Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Kurdish allies who fought alongside the U.S. as \"not angels.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday afternoon before the meeting, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly called the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Syria a mistake. He told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that he thinks he speaks for most of the members of his conference when he says that \"this was a mistake and I hope that it can be repaired.\"\n\nEven some of the president's staunchest allies, like South Carolina's Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have sternly criticized the president's decision to pull a small number of troops from northern Syria.\n\nVice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are heading to Turkey Wednesday.", "description": "President Trump is meeting with congressional leaders after repeatedly criticizing the Kurds as \"not angels\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/01/02/9500762d-dfdf-4e7b-9e02-20c1a0e7f8e8/thumbnail/1200x630/fee54fda91c923e40d0369282fdcb7d0/rtx6kmul-layout-comp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
