One such driver is of course \u2019s correlation with the . However, a point I have made many times in the past is that such correlations do break down from time to time and this is the case at present.\n\nWhen this relationship is working as expected, gold rises as the U.S. dollar falls and vice versa. Not so at present, with the recent weakness in the currency of first reserve having little or no effect on the precious metal which on some days has been falling in lockstep.\n\nLooking at this from the inverse perspective, when gold and the U.S. dollar are rising in tandem it's generally considered to be a worrying sign with the currency and the metal being bought on risk flow. If the two are falling, can we assume the opposite to be true?\n\nCertainly as far as risk-on sentiment is concerned this may well be the case, with both the and the breaking through very strong resistance on the daily charts. This has been capping any advance for almost two years.\n\nFrom a purely technical perspective, the metal continues to trade in congestion on the daily chart at the volume point of control denoted with the yellow dashed line, with price agreement having been reached for the time being. This is the fulcrum for the precious metal and also represents the heaviest volume on the histogram, with no bias to one side or the other.\n\nWhat is interesting is the price action which follows each rally, with a sharp move lower, coupled with lower highs. Friday\u2019s price action was also a further sign of weakness, with the effort to breach $1520 capped and closing with a deep upper-wicked candle on higher volume. A sign of selling, which has followed through into the start of the new trading week.\n\nGold Monthly Chart\n\nA quick look at the monthly chart also highlights the principle issue with gold in that it is still confined to the spread of August\u2019s volatility candle which is a $150 per ounce range. The indicator calculates price action using average true range and appears once this metric has been exceeded for the instrument. It's a signal for congestion to follow or a reversal.\n\nIn summary, the bullish tone which has propelled gold higher over the summer appears to be waning. With no sign of any inflation on the horizon and risk-on gaining traction, this is all adding to a heavy tone for the metal with further congestion around the volume point of control expected.", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Anna Coulling covering: XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures, S&P 500 Futures.
