No knock on Ky, but obviously he's a superstar, he's first. Sometimes his emotions were put in front of the team.\n\n\"I think here, we're all transparent with each other. We can all go up to each other and be honest with each other. That's the biggest thing, when you can go out and speak to your brother.\"\n\nThat certainly sounds like a knock on Irving, who was accused of taking veiled shots at his Celtics teammates -- especially \"the young guys\" -- in conversations with the media.\n\nBoston's chemistry issues, Morris admitted, were partly caused by circumstance: Injuries to Irving and Gordon Hayward in 2017-18 gave more opportunity to young players like Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier, who had to take a back seat the following season when the veterans returned.\n\n\"Kyrie goes down, we finish the season with a lot of young guys. Everybody knows their role,\" Morris added. \"So when he comes back, it's hard for everybody to take a step back.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nMorris doesn't see a similar situation happening in New York, which doesn't boast a true \"star\" player. That's ironically thanks to Irving, who along with Kevin Durant spurned the Knicks to join the rival Brooklyn Nets in free agency.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
