Cooper said the incident could prevent a future career in the modelling industry.\n\nAccording to claims reported by the Hull Daily Mail, after posting pictures on social media of a new glamour portfolio, a man reached out to Cooper. He claimed that he could advance her modelling career, and offered her money to have sex with him on camera.\n\nWhen the man discovered that Ria had male sexual organs, he broke off contact, saying he would not work with her because she still had \u201ca c**k\u201d.\n\nIn a private message, the man reportedly said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you send one of yours, my friend just told me \u2014 sorry Playboy won\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nSweden: Gender Surgery on Young People Lacks Evidence of Preventing Suicide https://t.co/EnX8RxvWAn \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 11, 2019\n\nSpeaking to the local newspaper, Ria said: \u201cI am reporting this as a hate crime. It\u2019s like calling someone who is black the \u2018N\u2019 word. It doesn\u2019t matter if I have c*** or not. The pictures should be judged as they are. It says on my social media profile that I am a ladyboy, I didn\u2019t ever say that I wasn\u2019t and I thought he knew.\u201d\n\nThe aspiring model went on to say: \u201cI want to be a glamour model and a porn star \u2014 that\u2019s what I want to do. I don\u2019t think I should be treated like this. I just think those comments could easily make someone commit suicide. It is so bad that I have gone to the police.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Humberside Police told the paper: \u201cWe received a report of a hate incident\u2026 The report has been logged and will be investigated.\u201d", "description": "Police in the UK are investigating an alleged hate incident in which a trans model was denied a job as a porn star for having a penis.", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/Transgender.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
