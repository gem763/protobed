The power to enter into such agreements is reserved to the federal government, which must be able to speak with one voice in the area of US foreign policy,\" said Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark, the head of the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. \"California's unlawful cap-and-trade agreement with Quebec undermines the President's ability to negotiate competitive agreements with other nations as the President sees fit.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest broadside by the Trump administration against California . Leaders in the liberal state have feuded with President Donald Trump as he has challenged their progressive environmental policies and criticized them for a homelessness problem.\n\nLast month, Trump said that he was revoking California's authority to set its own vehicle emission standards, leading to concern from environmentalists that the state's downward trend in air pollution could be affected.\n\nRead More", "description": "The Justice Department sued California on Wednesday, claiming that the state bypassed federal authority when it entered into an environmental agreement with the Canadian province of Quebec to combat air pollution.", "authors": ["David Shortell"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/120221084826-smoke-stacks-air-pollution-chemical-plant-story-top.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
