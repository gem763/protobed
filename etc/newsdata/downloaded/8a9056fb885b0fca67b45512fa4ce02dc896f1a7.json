It was an unusual spot in that it wasn\u2019t about Joe Biden at all. It was about Barack Obama.\n\nBarack Obama was a great president. We don\u2019t say that enough. pic.twitter.com/FLiYpg8jLR \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cBarack Obama was a great president,\u201d could be the slogan of Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. In the first answer Biden gave at the debate, he turned to Sen. Elizabeth Warren and said, \u201cthe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie. Well, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d\n\nTo twist Biden\u2019s 2007 line about Rudy Giuliani, it often seems that, for Biden, there are three parts to a sentence: a noun, a verb, and Barack Obama.\n\nBiden served loyally and effectively as Obama\u2019s vice president. When Obama wanted to make sure stimulus money didn\u2019t disappear to fraud, he turned to Biden \u2014 \u201cnobody messes with Joe,\u201d he said \u2014 and Biden came through. When the White House wanted to avoid the fiscal cliff, it was Biden who closed the deal with Mitch McConnell, then the Senate minority leader. When Obama flubbed the first debate against Mitt Romney, it was Biden who restored the ticket\u2019s mojo by bullying his way past Rep. Paul Ryan. When the Democrats held their 2012 convention, it was Biden\u2019s speech that pulled the highest ratings \u2014 beating both Bill Clinton and Obama.\n\nBut Joe Biden is not Barack Obama. Some vice presidents are picked for emphasis; Bill Clinton chose Al Gore to drive home his youth and moderation. Others are picked for balance; they\u2019re chosen not for their similarity to the nominee but for their difference. Biden was a balance pick. \u201cI want somebody with gray in his hair,\u201d Obama said. Biden\u2019s presence on the ticket showed that Obama knew what he didn\u2019t know. But that\u2019s why, by definition, Biden doesn\u2019t mirror Obama\u2019s political appeal or personal style and will not mirror Obama\u2019s approach to governance.\n\nBiden is not neatly to the right or left of Obama on foreign or domestic policy, and he diverges dramatically in how he makes decisions, how he understands the basic material of politics, and how he\u2019d run an administration. So in campaigning so explicitly as the inheritor of Obama\u2019s mantle, he obscures both his distinct strengths and his weaknesses, and confuses voters about the kind of president he would be.\n\nIt is time for Joe Biden to stop campaigning for Obama\u2019s third term and focus on the case for his first.\n\nIraq: the definitional difference\n\nStart with foreign policy, where the president has maximum authority and where Biden\u2019s policy roots run deepest.\n\nBiden and Obama were on opposite sides of the central foreign policy question of the era: whether or not to invade Iraq. Biden voted to give President George W. Bush authorization for the war, and though he was critical of Bush\u2019s preparation and execution, his primary argument wasn\u2019t that Bush was wrong to invade but that he was insufficiently committed to the intervention\u2019s success and hid the true cost from the public. In Promises to Keep, Biden\u2019s 2007 memoir, he wrote:\n\nI still maintain that the costliest mistake the president made was his unwillingness to level with the American people about what would be required to prevail in Iraq. He never seemed willing to ask any but a small percentage to make a real sacrifice to win the war. He didn\u2019t tell them that well over one hundred thousand troops would be needed for many years. He didn\u2019t tell them that the cost could surpass $300 billion. He didn\u2019t tell them that even after paying such a heavy price, success was not assured because no one had ever succeeded before at forcibly remaking a nation, let alone an entire region.\n\nObama, of course, opposed the Iraq war outright \u2014 which was one reason he soundly beat Biden in the 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nStill, it would be too simplistic to say that the sole difference between Obama and Biden on foreign policy was hawkishness.\n\nIn the Obama administration, Biden often took the dovish position \u2014 driven, perhaps, by a comfort Obama didn\u2019t always show in standing up to the military\u2019s recommendations. Biden argued against expanding American forces in Afghanistan while Obama ultimately committed 30,000 more troops. He recommended against the raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. He recommended against the intervention in Libya, a warning that now looks prescient.\n\nIn his White House memoir The World as It Is, Ben Rhodes recalls that Biden \u201crepeatedly declar[ed] that experience had taught him that \u2018all foreign policy is the extension of personal relationships.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s not how Obama saw foreign policy. But, just as importantly, it\u2019s not how Obama saw domestic policy, either.\n\nThe personal is political\n\nBiden\u2019s 2020 campaign thoroughly lionizes Obama, but during his vice presidency, the quiet critique of Obama that thrummed through Biden\u2019s world \u2014 and was echoed across Washington \u2014 is that Obama didn\u2019t spend enough time schmoozing congressional Republicans, or even congressional Democrats. Perhaps if he spent more time building trust and friendship with congressional leaders, he\u2019d be able to get more done.\n\nIn his 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner routine, Obama delivered a funny-because-he-wasn\u2019t-joking riff on these criticisms. \u201cSome folks still don\u2019t think I spend enough time with Congress,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Why don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\u2019 they ask. Really? Why don\u2019t you get a drink with Mitch McConnell!?\u201d\n\nThis is part of the balance Biden brought as vice president. Obama \u201cneeded somebody who would deal with Mitch so he wouldn\u2019t have to,\u201d David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s chief strategist, said. Biden\u2019s approach to politics \u2014 whether it\u2019s foreign leaders, congressional negotiations, or the Iowa State Fair \u2014 is relational. Biden was often deployed to do the in-person work Obama dismissed.\n\nUnlike Obama, Biden is a true creature of the Senate. I\u2019ve profiled Biden\u2019s Senate career at greater length elsewhere so I won\u2019t retell those stories here. Suffice to say that Biden\u2019s political career has been defined by his enthusiasm for Senate relationships, and you can look at that as both an argument for or against his candidacy:\n\nBiden may be the candidate with the best chance of getting legislation through the system as it exists today. If McConnell is the majority leader, if 51 Democrats are still subject to the whims of the filibuster, he might be able to squeeze a bit more out of his former colleagues than his competitors can. [...] But if you believe that the problems of American politics have passed from the personal to the structural, this is cold comfort. A president with less recollection of how legislating worked in past eras may be freer to imagine the reforms necessary to make it work in the future. Biden is probably the candidate least likely to prioritize ambitious reform of the system. In seeing the humanity of his colleagues so clearly, he has lost sight of the structure that surrounds them; 45 years of personal kindnesses, and a career built in the age of mixed parties, can do a lot to obscure the overarching power of polarization.\n\nThis gestures toward the most important political difference between Obama and Biden, one that Biden is strategically obscuring but one that lurks as a vulnerability in his campaign.\n\nObama railed against the system. Biden represents it.\n\nIn 2008, Obama ran as a reformer disgusted by the corruption and polarization paralyzing American politics. Even as president, he radiated a politically useful contempt for the trivialities and politicking of Washington.\n\nBiden represents the system Obama sought to reform. That\u2019s the role Biden initially played on the ticket: Obama was a young guy who turned his inexperience into an asset by distancing himself from a political establishment that had failed Americans, Biden was an older guy who could act as ambassador and guide to that system as necessary.\n\nThis is a real vulnerability for Biden. On his own, he will be held responsible for the four decades of policymaking that he participated in. Iraq, the bankruptcy bill, the crime bill, NAFTA, the offshoring of jobs to China \u2014 all of it. And the flip side of Biden\u2019s effort to take credit for the Obama administration\u2019s achievements is that he also owns its failures. \u201cYou invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign,\u201d Cory Booker shot at Biden during the second Democratic debate. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it when it\u2019s convenient and then dodge it when it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nIn this respect, Biden is less an inheritor of Obama\u2019s critique of American politics than its target, and Trump, who is skilled at running against the Washington establishment, will take full advantage.\n\nThe promise of Biden\u2019s campaign is that, after four years of Trump, the American people will be ready for someone who knows how Washington works and wants to use that knowledge for their benefit. It is, in many ways, the reverse of Obama\u2019s initial promise \u2014 which perhaps makes Biden right for this moment but makes him fundamentally different from Obama in both his appeal and his vulnerabilities. And it\u2019s a big bet for Democrats to make: In recent presidential elections, Americans have repeatedly chosen the outsider, not the insider, candidate.\n\nFor that reason, Biden needs to make the argument for his style of politics clearly and explicitly. And, at times, he has. \u201cSome of these people are saying. \u2018Biden just doesn\u2019t get it,\u2019\u201d Biden said in his announcement speech. \u201cYou can\u2019t work with Republicans anymore. That\u2019s not the way it works anymore. Well, folks, I\u2019m going to say something outrageous. I know how to make government work \u2014 not because I\u2019ve talked or tweeted about it, but because I\u2019ve done it. I\u2019ve worked across the aisle to reach consensus. To help make government work in the past. I can do that again with your help.\u201d\n\nThe problem Biden faces in rooting himself so thoroughly in the Obama administration is that government often didn\u2019t work in that era. After retaking the House in 2010, Republicans blocked Obama\u2019s agenda and Washington ground into gridlock and recrimination. When Hillary Clinton ran in 2016 as the continuation of the Obama era, she lost to Donald Trump. It\u2019s possible that four years of Trump have caused voters to rethink that preference, but it\u2019s a thin argument.\n\nBiden needs to make the case that he can move beyond the frustrations of Obama\u2019s second term, that his approach will build on what came before rather than simply return to it. This is an argument that my reporting suggests Biden believes, but he spends so much of his energy in the debates extolling Obama\u2019s approach to politics that he\u2019s left himself little space to define his own.\n\nThis is why Biden needs to run as his own man rather than as Obama\u2019s. He is not Obama, and he will not be able to pursue an Obama-like campaign or run an Obama-like administration. He will have his own ideas, his own staff, his own ways of deciding difficult issues and navigating the byways of American politics. What needs to be established is the case for Joe Biden, not the case for Barack Obama.\n\nObama may have been a great president, but he\u2019s not running.
