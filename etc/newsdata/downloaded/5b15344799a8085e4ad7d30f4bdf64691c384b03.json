Former Editor-in-Chief of The Moscow News, he is author of the book, 'Midnight in the American Empire,' released in 2013.\n\nWashington's political football has taken another bounce, skipping from Russia to Ukraine in just days. Democrats made the move to impeach Trump, but why only now?\n\nLike some rogue cyborg responding to a programmed 'terminate' command, the Democratic Party has shown a relentless, laser-guided determination to destroy Donald Trump regardless of the consequences not only to their own political fortunes, but to the very integrity and viability of the nation.\n\nIndeed, rather than humbly accept defeat following the Russiagate debacle, which held the Republic in a suspended state of mind-numbing animation for three tortuous years, the malevolent machine was merely rebooted. Today, the Democrats and their liberal gimp media are no longer obsessed by the Kremlin, Wikileaks, and a pee-stained hotel bed somewhere in central Moscow, but rather a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nAlso on rt.com Dear America, civil war is not a joke \u2013 or a picnic\n\nHello Russiagate 2.0\n\nFor those who have lost the plot for this latest DC thriller, here is the abridged version.\n\nDuring a July 25 telephone conversation, the full transcript of which is accessible here, Trump asked Zelensky to \"do us a favor,\" which involved digging up dirt on Joe Biden, a leading Democratic contender in the 2020 presidential race. The task wouldn't require a very large shovel, of course, since Biden had already implicated himself when he publicly bragged about forcing Ukraine to terminate its chief prosecutor Viktor Shokin, or risk losing a cool billion dollars in US financial aid. Who is Viktor Shokin? None other than the guy leading an investigation of Biden's son, Hunter, who received millions of dollars for the pleasure of squatting on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nIn other words, Biden offered Ukraine a bald-faced quid pro quo, exactly what the Democrats are accusing Trump of doing. There's just one glaring problem, however, with the Democratic charges: nowhere in the transcript of the call does Trump ever suggest he will compensate Kiev for carrying out his requests.\n\nThat nagging detail, however, did not stop the Democratic crazy train, with 300 million jaded American passengers on board, from departing the station for a non-stop ride to impeachment proceedings.\n\nThis latest rush by the Democrats to bring down Trump seems less of an effort based on sound political strategy than one that is driven by raw desperation. How else to explain the decision by the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to announce an impeachment inquiry against the president when she hadn't even read the transcript? That is an incredible admission, especially considering what the country has already been through for the past three years. Moreover, impeaching a sitting president is a radical, almost unheard of step that has only occurred twice in the nation's history, against Andrew Jackson and Bill Clinton. Neither effort resulted in those leaders being forced from office. So, why on earth risk it?\n\nThe media is accusing President Trump of \"mob-like\" behaviors\n\n\n\nBut what about Joe Biden?\n\n\n\nHe threatened to withhold $1B in USAID unless they fired the prosecutor investigating his sin\n\n\n\nNow he's demanding the media stop giving a platform to one of his political rivals\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd14 \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) September 30, 2019\n\nThere are other telltale signs that the Democrats, with no small help from the fawning media, are spinning yet another tale of intrigue every bit as Clancy-esque as Russiagate. Not unlike Pelosi, the White House whistle-blower - alleged to have been a CIA 'conscientious objector,' quite possibly a historic first in the dark underworld of espionage - issued a complaint based on second-hand sources. And the plot keeps thickening.\n\nUntil just days before the transcript was made public, such 'evidence' would have been considered inadmissible since only firsthand knowledge was deemed worthy of consideration. Some bureaucrat, however, showed amazing acuity in altering those conditions just before the Democrats would lower the hammer. Now, just in time for the impeachment show trial, the intelligent community's new and improved complaint form, as reported by the Federalist, \"no longer requires potential whistleblowers\u2026 to have direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged wrongdoing that they are reporting.\"\n\nHow do you spell pathetic? As of today, there are 399 days left until #Election2020. Think about that for a minute. Barely over a year and the Dems have yet to craft a coherent policy save for the surgical extraction of a duly-elected POTUS, their opponent. \u2014 Lionel\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@LionelMedia) October 1, 2019\n\nIn other words, it looks like the Democrats are up to their usual dirty tricks. At this point it must be asked, what is the driving force behind their obsessive hatred of Trump, which has provoked a dire situation in the country that conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh has dubbed a \"cold civil war\" between the two parties?\n\nIs Democratic desperation a sign of guilt?\n\nWithout bothering to educate herself first on the Trump-Zelensky conversation, Pelosi has disgraced her office, while, at the same time, opening up the Democrats to the possibility of massive setbacks, possibly even self-destruction, on the political front.\n\nPelosi admitted nearly as much when she said \"it doesn't matter\" when asked by a reporter if the Democrats' push for impeachment may damage their chances of holding onto the House down the road. \"Our first responsibility is to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,\" she affirmed. Is anybody buying that explanation?\n\nAs much as we would all like to believe that modern US politicians are intrinsically guided by some patriotic and lyrical 'love of country' and 'duty to the constitution,' the evidence points to far less altruistic motives. Considering the collective wealth of congressional members alone suggests that the overwhelming majority of US politicians are in the political swamp known as Washington DC merely to enrich themselves.\n\nOthers may argue that the Democrats have essentially launched a preemptive strike against the 2020 presidential election, which they have a very narrow chance of winning given their lackluster field of contenders. Considering the high risks of pressing forward with impeachment, however, which the Democrats have admitted could even cost them the House, that suggestion also sounds implausible.\n\nSo, what is it? Why so much non-stop fear and loathing from the Democratic camp ever since Trump took over the White House in 2016?\n\nMuch of the Democratic angst goes back to the 2016 campaign trail when Trump boldly proclaimed that he would 'drain the swamp.' I don't think he was just speaking rhetorically. Many Americans are unaware of it, simply because the mainstream media has concealed the news, but the Democrats are under investigation by the White House.\n\nBack in May, Trump awarded sweeping powers to his Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate claims that the Democrats were \"spying\" on his campaign, a very serious charge that would make Watergate resemble a picnic by comparison. Meanwhile, in the same week that the Democrats were recklessly pushing forward with their impeachment inquiry, the New York Times reported that the US State Department had reopened its investigation into Hillary Clinton's abuse of her email service, which compromised an untold number of classified government documents.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump tweets quote warning that impeachment will cause \u2018Civil War-like fracture\u2019 in US\n\n\"As many as 130 officials have been contacted in recent weeks by State Department investigators \u2014 a list that includes senior officials who reported directly to Clinton\u2026\" The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn other words, the gloves have come off in the US capital. If you doubt that, consider this: if some Washington whistleblower, or \"spy\" as Trump has called the individual, was able to receive second-hand information about a classified phone call between Trump and a foreign leader, then it stands to reason that these same people knew for a long time that the Barr investigation had begun to focus on Clinton's insecure email box. Thus, the Democrats could very well be engaged in 'obstruction of justice' while portraying Trump as the villain. Now, should the US president attempt to proceed with criminal charges against his opponents, the Democrats will scream in one media-backed voice that Trump is the one attempting to avoid persecution.\n\nThe Democrats, displaying incredible recklessness and impulsiveness in their latest effort to take down the House of Trump, may be less interested in winning back the White House in 2020 and far more interested in avoiding jail time. Nothing else adequately explains their crazed level of vindictiveness.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
