Mr. Cuban has an opinion on, well, everything. College? He\u2019s against it. NBA officiating? It stinks. President Donald Trump? He\u2019s awful.\n\nYet when it comes to a matter rather close to Mr. Cuban\u2019s own interests \u2014 the brouhaha involving another Texan NBA team, the Houston Rockets, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the mistreatment of Rockets\u2019 general manager Daryl Morey \u2014 he has uncharacteristically clammed up. His usually prolific Twitter feed has gone silent and he\u2019s made no public statements on the matter.\n\nThat reticence continued Tuesday evening. Reached via his personal email account, Mr. Cuban would only tell the Washington Times, \u201c\u2018ll refer you to Adam silvers [sic] comments.\u201d NBA Commissioner Silver released a statement earlier this week declaring that \u201cwe have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China.\u201d\n\nOf course, Mark Cuban is hardly the only usually chatty NBA figure to go uncharacteristically silent on the China issue. Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach whose postgame press conferences tend to dwell more on politics than rebounds and the pick and roll, has evinced complete ignorance on the matter. LeBron James, the wildly talented forward for the Lakers who never shies from politics, has gone silent.\n\nBut Mark Cuban\u2019s silence is the most telling. When Mark Cuban \u2014 I repeat, Mark Cuban! \u2014 of all people declines to comment, you know how much fear of China there really is out there.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
