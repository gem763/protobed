The best camera you have is probably the one in your pocket: a phone. But that hasn\u2019t stopped Sony\u2019s RX100 line of compact point-and-shoot cameras from being wildly popular. Galaxy phones, Pixels, and iPhones can produce great results, but the bigger, high-resolution sensor in the RX100 captures much more detail and color. The new RX100 Mark VI, which costs $1,199.99, pairs that big sensor with an 8.3x optical zoom lens that has way more reach than you could ever get from your phone.\n\nHigh-end pocket cameras like the Sony RX100 VI are the perfect mix between mirrorless and point-and-shoot. They let you capture detailed photo and video better than you can get with your phone, and then you can transfer those results to your phone for posting to social media.\n\nBut is the $1,200 price tag for the RX100 VI way too high of an asking price for a point-and-shoot camera? When it comes to the portability and performance the RX100 VI has, it\u2019s surprisingly worth it.\n\nSony RX100 VI Specs 20-megapixel, one-inch BSI-CMOS sensor\n\n24-200mm zoom\n\nF2.8-4.5 aperture\n\n315 focus points, with 24 fps continuous shooting\n\nThree-inch tilting LCD display, with 921K dot resolution\n\nOLED electronic viewfinder with 2.3M dot resolution, 100 percent coverage\n\n4K at 24 / 25 / 30 fps recording, 1080p HD recording at 24 / 60 / 100 / 120 fps\n\nWiFi / USB 2.0 for charging / micro-HDMI\n\nSDXC / SDHC support\n\nWeighs 10.62 oz. / 301 grams.\n\nMy first reaction to holding the RX100 is that it\u2019s tiny. It\u2019s thicker any current smartphone, of course, but its overall footprint is minimal enough that it can fit in most jean pockets. The build quality of the RX100\u2019s metal chassis is sturdy and reliable, but there\u2019s no shock-resistance or waterproofing. You still have to take care of it.\n\nAlso, the RX100 VI lacks any sort of grip \u2014 rubber, faux-leather, or otherwise \u2014 and that can make it slippery to hold. But Sony makes up for this by making the camera lightweight (it\u2019s just two-thirds of a pound), so while there are those who might think the RX100 VI is a super miniature mirrorless camera, it still is just a souped-up point-and-shoot.\n\nThere are a lot of buttons on the RX100 \u2014 especially for a point-and-shoot, so learning them all and customizing the ones you\u2019ll need most will take some practice using it in the field.\n\nBut portability and ergonomics are just two aspects that represent something bigger about the RX100 VI. The built-in electronic viewfinder is what closes the gap between the RX100 VI being a run-of-the-mill point-and-shoot and a mirrorless camera. It turns on the camera when ejected, so it also serves as a secondary way of quickly turning the RX100 on to grab quick shots with tight framing.\n\nLearn the controls well and you can draw it at speed\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re shooting a dog running across a field, the RX100\u2019s burst mode goes up to 24 fps. So, if you\u2019re coming from a full-sized camera and miss the ergonomics of a fast-handling grip, you can practice the process of pulling the viewfinder\u2019s latch down (which turns the unit on), placing it in front of your eye, then capturing a flurry of photographs.\n\nThe fact that you can use the RX100 like you would an interchangeable mirrorless camera (like the Sony Alpha A7 cameras I reviewed) means it can fill in for situations where an interchangeable lens camera is too flashy, heavy, or can\u2019t even be used safely. It\u2019s ideal for travel, as you don\u2019t have to carry a bunch of lenses or worry about an expensive camera rig attracting unwanted attention.\n\nCompared to an entry-level mirrorless camera, like Sony\u2019s own a5100 that costs $450 with a kit lens, there are trade-offs but also a few advantages in the RX100\u2019s favor. The RX100 VI\u2019s long zoom lens gives you the reach of multiple lenses in one. It\u2019s also more user-friendly, is much smaller, and has a built-in viewfinder. However, the a5100 has a larger sensor, better low-light performance, and costs less than half the RX100 VI\u2019s asking price.\n\nShooting video in 4K or 1080p still results in crisp, clear, and smooth footage with accurate color reproduction. White balance accurately changes from bright to dimly lit scenes, but if you want the best results, you should use the RX100\u2019s flatter color profile so you can color-correct the rest in post-production.\n\nRecord flat and color in post-production\n\nThe RX100 also has optical stabilization to smooth panning and changes in height when you\u2019re filming. It also does a decent job keeping stills from turning out blurry, but of course this gets harder if you\u2019re zoomed in on a far away subject.\n\nThere is a critical omission for the RX100 VI: a microphone / headphone port. It\u2019s an interesting design decision by Sony because including a mic port would put the RX100 VI\u2019s video capabilities on par with the mirrorless Sony Alpha cameras, and make it a formidable vlogging camera. It\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that the only audio recording option is the average-sounding built-in stereo mic, because you can flip the screen up to face toward you to use in selfie mode. Sony also augments the RX100\u2019s articulating screen by automatically using face detection if you point it toward you, then sets a three-second timer once you click the shutter button. It\u2019s straightforward and an easy way for practicing your selfie angles.\n\nIt\u2019s probably the ultimate selfie point-and-shoot\n\nOkay, so it shoots good video and can take 20-megapixel selfies. Is the Sony RX100 a venerable shooter? Yes, but it has its limitations: the RX100 doesn\u2019t have as bright a lens when compared to last year\u2019s brighter Mark V lens (f/1.8 vs. f/2.8). You\u2019ll suffer from some extra noise or graininess and slower shutter time if you want a decent shot. It\u2019s a trade-off Sony had to make for the zoom lens, which is far longer than on earlier versions of the RX100. On the flip side, the RX100 VI thrives in well-lit environments whether it\u2019s outdoors or indoors.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony has squeezed in enough of a basic kit (zoom lens, a viewfinder, 4K, and flash) to yield solid shooting performance shooting landscapes or subjects. Even if you\u2019re just a casual photographer and this point-and-shoot is your only camera besides your smartphone, the RX100 VI has enough versatility to shoot landscapes, subjects, or just about anything else. Having 315 autofocus points with a 200mm zoom lens always yields a better, sharper photo than your phone\u2019s camera and lens setup can muster, period.\n\nHowever, just like your phone, you\u2019ll have to keep tabs on the RX100\u2019s small battery. The battery charges via the microUSB port, and lasts around 250 shots before needing a charge, or just an hour of video recording. You should definitely buy an extra battery if you plan to use the RX100 VI all day long, because it definitely won\u2019t last through a busy day of shooting.\n\nSony also includes the PlayMemories Mobile app for the RX100 on iOS and Android, so wirelessly transferring photos (via Bluetooth, NFC, or Wi-Fi) to your phone works in a pinch. I say in a pinch because the PlayMemories app feels dated and is in dire need of a redesign, but the basic photo transfer functions do work at a decent pace for just a few photos.\n\nThe Sony RX100 VI is a handy and incredibly useful camera. If you\u2019re a traveler and don\u2019t want to carry a camera bag full of lenses, flashes, and audio equipment, then it\u2019s a small but powerful alternative. The $1,200 price tag might make you scoff at it, but the performance is well beyond what you can get with your phone.\n\nThe tiny (expensive) powerhouse\n\nThe RX100 VI is a Goldilocks camera that hits the sweet-spot between portability and capability. It\u2019s compact enough to go basically everywhere, but still provides much better photographic and video capabilities compared to your phone. After all, surprises can come in small packages.", "description": "A point-and-shoot for the serious photographer, the RX100 VI is a powerful little camera. It\u2019s easy for anyone to pick up, but you can also go full manual mode and take some more involved photos. However, for $1,200, it begs the question: does it make sense to spend on a P&S in a world of phone cameras and mirrorless setups?", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Aug", "Product Photos"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtyciZhQGdpkVNbz5ZkAMmqS_pY=/0x249:2040x1317/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12162763/akrales_180816_2793_0043.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-21"}
