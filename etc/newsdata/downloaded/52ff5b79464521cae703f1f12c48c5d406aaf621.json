Official results are due Oct. 31.\n\nThe biggest hit to profits came from weaker oil prices. Earnings in the company's oil and gas production unit are expected to fall about 45% from last year's $4.23 billion in operating profit, Exxon's data showed.\n\nIts refining business had improved margins that were offset by higher logistics costs, the filing showed. That business is expected to report profits fell about 18% from last year's $1.64 billion.\n\nIts chemicals unit earnings were projected to fall about 72% from the year ago's $713 million.\n\nExxon shares fell 2.4% on Tuesday to $68.95.\n\nThe company had warned analysts it was spending heavily to replace production and will not reach its profit goals until next year.\n\nLast quarter the company posted a 21% drop in profit as sharply higher oil production was offset by weakness in its refining and chemicals businesses.", "description": "Weak oil prices hit Exxon's third-quarter earnings: filing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF903MY_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
