When it launches on Friday, Nov. 1, Apple TV+ will kick off a new generation of streaming services that includes Disney+, debuting on Nov. 12, and HBO Max, which is slated to arrive next year. And while the tech giant\u2019s initial lineup of originals can\u2019t compete with the vast content libraries of its competitors, there is some good stuff in the mix. To help you decide whether to plunk down $4.99 a month for Apple TV+, I screened all of the new series provided for advance review. (Oprah\u2019s Book Club and a handful of children\u2019s programs also set to premiere Nov. 1 were not sent to critics.) Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to watch, what to skip and everything in between.\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nIs the flagship show from Apple TV+ everything a drama \u00e0 clef about morning television in the #MeToo era should be? Probably not. The intersection of feminism, fame and media deserves more depth\u2014and more boldness\u2014than early episodes of The Morning Show provide. Still, it\u2019s pretty enjoyable to watch Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell play versions of the sanitized personalities with whom so many of us start our days. A supporting cast that includes Mark Duplass, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and The Diary of a Teenage Girl star Bel Powley is just as strong. Add in solid dialogue, quick pacing and decent production values, and the result is addictive, if not quite revelatory, viewing. (For more on The Morning Show, read my full review.)\n\nThe Elephant Queen\n\nA hit at film festivals earlier this year, this nature doc from Victoria Stone and Mark Deeble follows a family of African elephants\u2014led by 50-year-old matriarch Athena\u2014as they trudge from one watering hole to the next, in search of hydration, sustenance and relief from the oppressive heat. The filmmakers get astonishing, often adorable, footage of the pachyderms trekking, playing and caring for one another. And Chiwetel Ejiofor provides gentle narration, introducing many animals who round out the elephants\u2019 ecosystem, from the frogs and turtles who make homes in their wading pools to the dung beetles who\u2026 well, you can imagine. One note of caution: Though The Elephant Queen is a family film, and it never devolves into a total downer, Athena\u2019s clan eventually weathers a drought. Stone and Deeble don\u2019t turn away from the tragedies that follow, in what might be a tough watch for very young viewers.\n\nWhat to Try\n\nFor All Mankind\n\n\u201cRed Moon.\u201d That\u2019s the newspaper headline on June 27, 1969 in the America of this solidly constructed alternate-history drama, which games out how the 20th century might\u2019ve gone if the Soviets had beaten the United States to the moon. As a prolonged space race unfolds, creator Ronald D. Moore (the cult TV maker behind Battlestar Galactica and Outlander) imagines a demoralized NASA, where The Killing star Joel Kinnaman\u2019s disgruntled astronaut Edward Baldwin sabotages his own career with a drunken rant to a reporter about the cowardice of the organization\u2019s leaders. Meanwhile, in a subplot that\u2019s sweet and timely but feels tacked on, a Mexican girl crosses the border with outer space on her mind. If you\u2019re intrigued by that premise\u2014and neither exhausted by \u201860s period pieces where brilliant, flawed men brood as brilliant, perfect women endure retro sexism, nor put off by frequent scenes of mission control guys frantically mashing buttons\u2014For All Mankind is going to be your show. If not, there\u2019s little else to see here.\n\nDickinson\n\nThere are straight-faced alternate histories, and then there\u2019s this bonkers show, which poses the question: What if Emily Dickinson, but too much? In an unexpectedly excellent casting choice, Hailee Steinfeld plays the poet as a mercurial, mischievous, proto-goth teen (think Aubrey Plaza with a sugar high) who\u2019s desperate to escape the domestic sphere. Obstacles to her liberation include a mother who\u2019s obsessed with housework (Jane Krakowski in \u201czany Jenna Maroney project\u201d mode), a fond but sexist dad (Toby Huss) and a brother (Adrian Enscoe) who insists on marrying Emily\u2019s best friend and secret lover (Ella Hunt). Episodes inspired by poems juxtapose 19th-century visuals with contemporary-ish language, pop music and such YA archetypes as mean girls (and an inexplicable gay Japanese teen whose depiction made me cringe). The Dickinson kids throw an opium-fueled rager, grinding to rap in floor-length gowns. Emily escapes her home, one night, to snuggle with the personification of Death\u2014played by an extremely high-looking Wiz Khalifa\u2014in a carriage pulled by ghost horses.\n\nThe show is kind of a mess, veering between empathetic depictions of its hero\u2019s struggles against the social norms of her time and slapstick humor that recalls Comedy Central\u2019s costume-drama parody Another Period. Yet it\u2019s never boring. And to the extent that it represents Apple\u2019s bravery in taking on a strange project from a first-time creator, Alena Smith, Dickinson may be the most promising show to come out of the service\u2019s initial lineup.\n\nWhat to Skip\n\nSee\n\nAs TV execs scramble to find the next Game of Thrones, you can\u2019t blame a new platform for throwing money at a big, silly genre show. But, at a reported cost of $15 million per episode, See is both bigger and sillier than most of its competition. Starring Khal Drogo himself, Jason Momoa, the sci-fi/fantasy hybrid takes place hundreds of years after a 21st-century virus wiped out all but 2 million humans, leaving those survivors\u2014and, for some reason, all future generations\u2014blind. Society has long since reorganized itself around sightlessness, a process that apparently entailed regressing into primitive, superstitious, warring tribes. Momoa\u2019s Baba Voss is, unsurprisingly, a distinguished warrior with a heart of gold, who\u2019s raising twin babies fathered by his new mate\u2019s old lover as his own. The twist is that the kids and their biological dad, a guy who happens to be the object of a cruel charlatan queen\u2019s (Sylvia Hoeks) obsession, can see.\n\nIt isn\u2019t a hopeless setup, though the idea that universal blindness would bring out the worst in humanity for centuries to come may verge on ableism. Yet the execution, particularly in scripts by Steven Knight (of January\u2019s box-office bomb Serenity), is an unmitigated disaster. Speaking with that grand, stagey inflection I think of as Fantasy Voice, characters say things like: \u201cI feel savage intent in the air.\u201d Sex scenes, including what may well be the most awkward masturbation sequence in the history of television, are uniformly creepy. The plot has more holes than a sieve. Aside from Momoa doing what he does best\u2014fighting, grunting, snuggling\u2014Alfre Woodard gives the only memorable performance. Costumes look recycled from a dozen medieval or post-apocalyptic movies, though the queen could be an Anthropologie model. Director Francis Lawrence (who helmed the final three Hunger Games movies) gets in some lovely nature shots, but the massive amount of screentime devoted to combat and foot travel can be mind numbing. Not to put too fine a point on it, See is one of the worst TV series I\u2019ve seen in years.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Your guide to the new streaming service: what to watch, what to skip and everything in between.", "authors": ["Judy Berman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/for_all_mankind_unit_photo_03.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
