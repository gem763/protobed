Larry Hogan using super PAC to sway public opinion on education, other issues", "language": "en", "text": "Campaign finance watchdogs said the governor\u2019s solicitation illustrates a troubling trend that has escalated over the past decade, as public officeholders find methods to raise unlimited money \u2014 some from undisclosed donors \u2014 in ways often prohibited for traditional candidate committees.\n\nThe second of six fundraisers listed in the memo took place in Annapolis last week, with donors asked to give as much as $10,000 apiece.\n\n\u201cPeople who want access and influence over a public official are going to open their wallets and write a check. And they don\u2019t really care [into which account] the elected official is depositing that check,\u201d said Paul S. Ryan, a vice president with Common Cause. \u201cThe law is not up to date in most places with this practice.\u201d\n\nEntities similar to Hogan\u2019s caused political trouble for D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) in 2015 and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) this year, after government-transparency advocates said the fundraising activity can blur ethical boundaries. Controversy over a political nonprofit aligned with former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) contributed to his 2018 downfall.\n\nRoughly a third of sitting governors have ties to such outside influence groups, according to a Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington report last year.\n\nBig money for the White House and for Congress. Now for D.C. city hall, too?\n\nIn Maryland, contribution limits and disclosure rules constrain how much money can flow to accounts controlled by candidates. But those rules no longer apply to Hogan, because he is not running for office, said Jared DeMarinis, Campaign Finance Director for the Maryland Board of Elections.\n\nHogan is term-limited, and he decided this spring not to challenge President Trump in the 2020 Republican primary. Like many states, Maryland\u2019s campaign finance laws have not been updated to cover advocacy by an elected official who is not a candidate.\n\n\u201cThis is a new model,\u201d DeMarinis said.\n\nThe governor is trying to accomplish indirectly what hehas largely been unable to do from inside the State House: pressure the General Assembly to side with him on contentious policy questions. Democrats have veto-proof majorities in both chambers, and have easily overturned Hogan\u2019s vetoes of bills to, among other things, raise the minimum wage, restore voting rights to felons and permanently protect oyster sanctuaries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be able to find enough like-minded legislators among Democrats, unless he pressures them through the public,\u201d said Goucher College political science professor Mileah Kromer. \u201c[It\u2019s] the tool left in his arsenal.\u201d\n\nThe effort has drawn concerns from critics, like Ryan, who note that people who want to curry favor with the governor could donate unlimited sums with limited public transparency.\n\nHogan declined to be interviewed about the fundraising push, as did his longtime supporter Thomas Kelso, who is chairing the campaign. \u201cWe will do whatever we can to advocate for the Governor\u2019s agenda,\u201d Kelso said in a statement.\n\nBoosters hope to raise $2 million by year\u2019s end for the super PAC, the Change Maryland Action Fund, and the nonprofit, Change Maryland. The latter grew out of the anti-tax crusade Hogan launched on Facebook in 2012, which ultimately powered his ascent to the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nThe money will aim to build public support for Hogan\u2019s second-term goals, including anti-tax messaging tied to the education plan, redistricting reform and installing toll lanes on interstates 495 and 270.\n\nDonors can expect their money to be \u201cspent to direct the public to call, email, crowd hearing rooms and put pressure on their legislators,\u201d the memo said, adding that since both accounts can accept unlimited donations, \u201cwe won\u2019t have nearly the amount of confusion that we did with the different entities during the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are switching from an electoral focus to an education and mobilization effort,\u201d the memo said.\n\nSenate President Thomas V. Mike Miller (D-Calvert) and House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County) declined to comment on the effort.\n\nBut other Democrats expressed outrage, saying Hogan should use the considerable power of the governorship to work with the legislature to shape policy details, not engage in an election-style public persuasion campaign framed in bumper stickers and catchphrases.\n\n\u201cThe notion that a governor would spend even a second on this rather focusing on the fact that Maryland eighth graders are doing math well below the national average is abhorrent,\u201d said state Sen. Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore), an outspoken advocate of the education plan who is on a committee charged with figuring out how to pay for it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his plan?\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard nothing but \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHogan spokesman Michael Ricci said the governor supports the mission of the education plan, but is trying to force political leaders to be upfront about how it will impact residents\u2019 pocketbooks.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s simply asking them to do their job,\u201d Ricci said.\n\nLandmark Maryland education bill to become law without Hogan\u2019s signature\n\nHogan has proved adept at political branding. His 2014 campaign-trail attack on a storm water management fee he derided as \u201cthe rain tax\u201d helped pressure the legislature to partially repeal it after he took office.\n\nHe has already ramped up a direct mail and social media campaign to rail against funding for the education plan, named for William E. \u201cBrit\u201d Kirwan, the former University of Maryland System president who chaired the advisory group that spent years developing it.\n\nHogan has called the plan, which could cost up to $3.8 billion a year, \u201cwell meaning\u201d but \u201chalf-baked\u201d and too expensive. He labeled it \u201cThe Kirwan Tax Plan,\u201d even though no public official so far has proposed increasing taxes to pay for it (to partially finance the plan, lawmakers have floated legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana use). The governor has circulated memes on his Facebook page warning of doomsday increases, any one of which would generate $3.8 billion in state tax revenue: income taxes up by 39 percent, sales tax up by 89 percent; and a more than fivefold increase in the property tax.\n\nSuch rhetoric has drawn howls from Democrats, including Party Chair Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, who accused the governor of collecting \u201cdark\u201d money to finance a fearmongering campaign to manipulate public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe more you can disconnect the conversation from facts and real figures,\u201d she said, \u201cthe more you can manipulate the public.\u201d\n\nTo build the case that Maryland needs to overhaul its education system, the Kirwan commission cites data showing, among other things, that only 40 percent of Maryland high school graduates can pass a standardized Algebra 1 exam and read at a 10th-grade level.\n\nIt recommended free preschool for every4-year-old; training teachers better and paying them more; expanding resources for poor and special-needs students; enhancing career and technology training; and implementing tougher accountability standards. To implement the plan, the state would have to increase education spending by roughly 22 percent over 10 years. Local governments would also increase their spending.\n\nA committee that is working on ways to pay for the plan includes Hogan\u2019s budget secretary, David Brinkley. The group has not yet issued recommendations.\n\nPublic opinion in Maryland sends conflicting signals to policymakers, said Kromer, who directs the Goucher Poll. About two-thirds of residents think Maryland spends \u201ctoo little\u201d on public education. But a majority also think their taxes are too high.\n\nThe Change Maryland Action Fund was created in February, as the governor was giving \u201cserious consideration\u201d to challenging Trump. The super PAC can accept unlimited donations but must disclose donors and expenditures to the IRS, experts said, and it must list the names of donors with the state ethics officials if it engages in lobbying.\n\nThe Change Maryland nonprofit organization, a 504 (c), can accept unlimited donations and is generally not required to disclose donors.\n\nThen-President Barack Obama similarly morphed his 2012 campaign organization into a political nonprofit, Organizing for America, that is exempt from donation limits and disclosure laws. It was the first time a sitting president created such a group and his supporters promised to disclose donors anyway.\n\nAlthough some states \u2014 notably California \u2014 have passed regulations to limit these organization\u2019s influence on state-level matters, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a proliferation of these officeholder controlled nonprofits that operate outside campaign finance rules and seem to be used to curry favor with officeholder,\u201d said Adav Noti, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center.\n\nIn Maryland, the coalition backing the education reforms has no plans to respond to Hogan\u2019s advocacy with a corresponding fundraising push. Instead, it has planned 32 community forums across the state to discuss shortcomings in local schools and rally support to fix them.\n\n\u201cWe hope to engage hundreds and thousands of people in their own communities,\u201d said Sean Johnson, political director with the Maryland State Education Association, which is part of the broader coalition.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing consensus we have a crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople expect their leaders to resolve it.\u201d\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan promises business leaders he will \u2018battle\u2019 Democrats\n\nHogan won\u2019t spend millions earmarked by Democrats for building schools, other priorities\n\nOpinion: The river of dark money just got darker and wider\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afterno Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Popular Republican governor is using a super PAC and his formidable branding skills against a landmark plan to end disparities in education.", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GAYY2HXCGUI6RN2ZHWEKLTU6DE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
