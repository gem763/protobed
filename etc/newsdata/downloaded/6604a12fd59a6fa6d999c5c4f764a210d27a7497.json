Was that a coincidence or did Beto\u2019s stunt spook Trump into taking the Democrats\u2019 biggest gun-control \u201cask\u201d off the table?\n\nPresident Donald Trump will not consider the House-passed universal background checks bill as part of his proposed gun package, according to a source familiar with the conversation on guns\u2026 \u201cThe things that they are proposing just aren\u2019t realistic and they know that and so it\u2019s designed more to talk to their political base and it\u2019s a lot more about that than I think an actual solution,\u201d [John] Thune said\u2026 While Trump will not support the House-passed universal background checks bill, he could still back a more limited form of background check legislation as well as so-called red flag laws. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who is working on a red flag bill with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said that background checks and red flag bills should go hand in hand.\n\nThe likely reality is that Trump intended all along to take UBCs off the table and was waiting for an opportune moment, which O\u2019Rourke, bless his heart, kindly provided. Pat Toomey sighs a weary sigh:\n\nRepublicans say the political momentum within their party to expand background checks suffered a blow last week when Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke declared, \u201chell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15s, your AK-47s\u201d at Thursday\u2019s primary debate\u2026 \u201cThis rhetoric undermines and hurts bipartisan efforts to actually make progress on commonsense gun safety efforts, like expanding background checks,\u201d Toomey, who has been at the center of Senate negotiations, warned Friday.\n\nThere are three \u201ctiers\u201d of background-check reforms kicking around in Congress. One is the Democrats\u2019 UBC bill, the proverbial full enchilada that would require background checks for online sales, gun-show sales, *and private sales*. That\u2019s now been ruled out by the White House if you believe Politico. The next tier is the Toomey/Manchin bill from 2013, which has been momentarily revived. That would require checks for online and gun-show sales but would leave the exemption for private sales in place. The odds of Trump endorsing that don\u2019t seem so hot either. The lowest tier is legislation that would tighten enforcement of existing background checks, with the White House reportedly considering a smartphone app that would allow private sellers to access the federal background check database remotely before a sale to see if the seller has been flagged. Manchin calls the idea \u201ccrazy,\u201d and it seems to me self-defeating if the White House is intent on maintaining the exemption for private sales. If and when an app is in place that makes it convenient for private sellers to run checks themselves, it\u2019ll be that much easier for Democrats to agitate to make those checks mandatory by law.\n\nWhatever happens, there\u2019s a lot of mental energy being expended right now on token legislation which no one believes will meaningfully reduce the rate of mass shootings!\n\nRed-flag laws remain the most interesting possibility still on the table, and Trump might be susceptible to having his arm twisted on that since his buddy Lindsey Graham is co-writing the main bill in the Senate. If nothing ends up passing now though, it surely means that no new gun control will pass before the election. It\u2019d be insane for Trump to hold off on signing anything a year out from Election Day and then panic six months from now, after another massacre somewhere. Righties would be much more demoralized to see him cave with the election so close than they\u2019d be if he caved now. The best time to pass something if he\u2019s inclined that way is ASAP and then use the next year to hammer gun-rights supporters with arguments against protesting by staying home on Election Day \u2014 \u201csocialism must be stopped,\u201d \u201cgun control under a Democratic administration will be 10 times more draconian,\u201d and so on. If Trump says no to reform this fall, he\u2019s essentially gambling that nothing catastrophic will happen over the next year that ends up galvanizing an electoral push on gun control. That\u2019s a reasonably safe gamble \u2014 public backlashes to gun rights after major violence are famously fleeting \u2014 but not completely riskless. To put all of that another way, if Trump\u2019s willing to do anything on background checks *at any point*, the time to do it is now.\n\nHere\u2019s McConnell today reiterating his view of this subject, that Senate Republicans aren\u2019t sticking their necks out a centimeter on gun control until they know what the president does and doesn\u2019t support. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to force vulnerable incumbents like Cory Gardner and Susan Collins out onto a limb by asking them to take a position on a controversial bill and then have Trump saw that limb off by declaring, \u201cNah, I\u2019m not signing anything.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThe things that they are proposing just aren\u2019t realistic...\"", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
