The archbishop said his decision was motivated by the Roman Catholic Church\u2019s opposition to gay marriage.\n\n\u201cThis is a common, temporary measure that does not affect a final determination,\u201d the archdiocese said in a statement.\n\nThe archbishop said the school will be able to resume celebrating Mass as the appeal moves forward.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
