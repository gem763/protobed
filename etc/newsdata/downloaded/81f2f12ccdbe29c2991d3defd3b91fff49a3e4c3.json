If so, how much? And, if you\u2019re willing to share, do you have a cash reserve as part of your retirement savings?\n\nSure. Happy to share. But let\u2019s start with some background.\n\nMost people are familiar with the idea of having an \u201cemergency fund\u201d during one\u2019s working years\u2014a pot of money (typically, equal to three to six months of living expenses) that can help with unexpected bills or, perhaps most important, tide you over if you lose your job. Unemployment, of course, isn\u2019t a risk for most retirees\u2014but a prolonged bear market is. As such, many financial advisers recommend holding a cash reserve in later life as an insurance policy, a way to pay your bills without having to sell investments when markets are tumbling.\n\nAsk a Question Have a question about planning for and living in retirement? Email askencore@wsj.com.\n\nAll that might sound simple, but cash reserves generate a surprising amount of debate and disagreement in financial-planning circles. Some experts, for instance, question whether retirees need a cash reserve at all. The thinking: The low returns on, say, a certificate of deposit or money-market fund (popular havens for cash) are a drag on your nest egg\u2019s overall performance. If you need money for an emergency, the thinking continues, tap your retirement savings.\n\nEven those advisers who do favor holding a cash reserve can\u2019t seem to agree on just how much money to set aside. One year of living expenses? Two years? More? (Which is another way of saying: No one knows how long the next bear market will last.)\n\nSo to return to your original question\u2026there is no single, correct answer. I think most people (and again, many financial advisers) like the idea of a cash reserve simply because of the \u201ccomfort\u201d factor, knowing you have cash on hand if the sky falls. In that sense, it\u2019s as much psychology as it is science.\n\n\u201cCash reserves are often more emotional\u2014more personal\u2014decisions,\u201d says Laurie Burkhardt, a certified financial planner with Modera Wealth Management in Boston. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking someone how much risk they want to take with their portfolio. The answer is different for everyone.\u201d\n\nMs. Burkhardt likes to see retired clients keep a cash reserve that amounts to at least a year of living expenses. If markets tank, that amount of time, she explains, allows for thoughtful planning\u2014the opportunity, for instance, to realize losses on some investments, offset gains on others and rebalance one\u2019s portfolio. But again, the \u201cright\u201d number, more often than not, is a \u201cpersonal preference,\u201d she says. Given that, she suggests: \u201cAsk yourself: What\u2019s going to help you sleep at night?\u201d\n\nAs for my nest egg, my wife and I have two years of living expenses in a money-market fund. The primary reason, as well as my primary concern: \u201csequence of returns\u201d risk. That\u2019s the risk of getting hit with negative returns early in retirement. If the value of your savings is falling and if, at the same time, you\u2019re withdrawing funds from those savings, that double whammy can deplete your nest egg in a hurry.\n\nEmergency Savings Asked how much money, if any, they had set aside for a financial emergency, surveyed baby boomers in these percentages said they could cover living expenses for: Don\u2019t know/ refused 7% 6-plus months None 25% 36% Less than 3 months 3 to 5 months 18% 13%\n\nGiven that my wife and I are still relatively new to retirement, I see our two-year cash reserve as (some) protection against sequence risk. I\u2019m also prepared to re-evaluate the size of, and need for, our cash reserve as we get deeper into retirement.\n\nWhere to keep your cash? There\u2019s no excuse today for failing to take advantage of websites\u2014Bankrate, BestCashCow and DepositAccounts, among others\u2014that can help steer you toward high-paying accounts.\n\nIn particular, more retirees seem to be getting over their aversion to online savings accounts\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing, Ms. Burkhardt says. Players like Ally Bank (ally.com) and Marcus, the online bank operated by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (marcus.com), she notes, can help you earn considerably more on your cash holdings than savings deposits at commercial banks or brokerage firms.\n\nFinally, if you wish to hold a large sum in cash but are worried about safety\u2014remember, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. covers up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank\u2014check out MaxMyInterest.com. This online service, Ms. Burkhardt says, \u201cfacilitates spreading your cash across multiple banks with the highest available rates.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI\u2019m planning to retire at age 67 and file for Social Security at 70. If I were to marry after retiring, how long would my wife and I need to be married before she would qualify for, first, a spousal benefit, and, second, a survivor\u2019s benefit?\n\nFor the most part, a couple must be married at least one year before either spouse is eligible for a spousal benefit. This assumes all other requirements are met. (For instance, most people first become eligible for a spousal benefit at age 62.)\n\nAs for a survivor\u2019s benefit, a couple must be married for at least nine months before either spouse is eligible for a survivor\u2019s benefit. Again, this assumes all other requirements are met. (For instance, most people first become eligible for a survivor\u2019s benefit at age 60.)\n\n***\n\nPlease tell your readers who are getting ready to enroll in Medicare about State Health Insurance Assistance Programs, or SHIPs. I live outside Atlanta and just finished working with GeorgiaCares. I found their help to be invaluable.\n\nGlad to do so.\n\nWe mentioned SHIPs briefly in a column about two years ago, but it\u2019s always worth highlighting this wonderful network. SHIPs operate in all 50 states and offer free counseling and assistance to Medicare-eligible individuals, their families and caregivers. You can find the office closest to you with a search tool on the group\u2019s website, shiptacenter.org.\n\nMost important, SHIPs allow you to sit down, face-to-face, with a real person, someone who can help you navigate the minefield that is Medicare. Trying to decide between traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage? Can\u2019t figure out how or when to sign up for coverage? Confused about benefits and who pays for what? Need help making changes in your coverage? SHIPs can help with all of these questions/issues and more.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re looking for meaningful volunteer work in retirement, consider joining SHIPs. You can make a big difference in a great many lives.\n\nMr. Ruffenach is a former reporter and editor for The Wall Street Journal.
