The CCI - the third such government-to-government initiative between Singapore and China, after the Suzhou Industrial Park and the Tianjin Eco-city - was launched in 2015 to build up western China\u2019s transport, finance and data links.\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing last year told Chinese news agency Xinhua that the CCI complements China\u2019s own Southern Transport Corridor campaign to connect provinces in the west of China to the sea with a north-south trade route.\n\nSingtel and StarHub had already announced their separate agreements with the same three Chinese operators: China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. They will deliver high-speed connectivity through the data channel to industrial parks such as Liangjiang Digital Economy Industrial Park, China Zhigu Science Park, Xiyong Microelectronics Industrial Park, and Blockchain Innovation Industrial Base.\n\nThe Business Times understands that Singtel has already hooked up its infrastructure to the Chinese operators\u2019 own networks. StarHub, which announced the tie-up in late August, needs fresh terrestrial cables to be laid in mainland China and aims to be ready for service by the first quarter of 2020, \u201csubject to implementation progress with our Chinese partners\u201d, a spokesman said.\n\nSeparately, Singtel also inked pacts on Wednesday to support seven Chongqing firms - from manufacturing, research, data-hosting and blockchain industries - in future Singapore operations.\n\nThese companies include mobile advertising firm Mobvista, market study service provider Listen (Chongqing) Data Technology, and data centre operator GDS, which recently tied up with Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC to build more data centres across China.\n\nSingtel, which is majority-owned by state investor Temasek Holdings, had already signed a master services agreement with China Mobile earlier this year to share mobile network for business customers to roll out Internet of Things (IoT)-connected devices in both countries.\n\nLim Seng Kong, managing director of Singtel\u2019s global enterprise business, has now said in a statement that the new data channel will enable business between the Asia-Pacific and western China, with data connectivity to boost the use of emerging technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence and data analytics.\n\nThe latest partnerships came at the government-to-government Singapore-China (Chongqing) Economic and Trade Cooperation Forum, held on Wednesday at the Shangri-La Hotel.\n\nOther tie-ups inked at the event include ST Engineering\u2019s plans to study line maintenance operations with Chongqing Airport Group, and to provide traffic, lighting and other smart city projects in a district of Chongqing, as well as a memorandum of understanding to help list western Chinese companies on the Singapore Exchange.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Technology - THE Singapore telecom regulator has launched a key project to connect businesses here with western China, after mainboard-listed telcos Singtel and StarHub separately announced that they would be developing fresh data links with their Chinese counterparts. .
