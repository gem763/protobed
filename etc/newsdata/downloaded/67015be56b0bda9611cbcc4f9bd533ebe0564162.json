Croughton, a Royal Air Force base that also houses U.S. Air Force communications in the Northeast London suburb, Brackley.\n\nLocal authorities say their investigation has become complicated after Ms. Sacoolas \u2014 who has diplomatic immunity \u2014 left the country despite telling authorities she didn\u2019t plan to.\n\nThus far, the U.S. has declined to get involved in the affair, with the U.S. Embassy in London denying a request for the diplomat\u2019s wife to be waived.\n\nFollowing Mr. Johnson\u2019s appearance, U.S. Embassy officials continued to deny confirmation on the women\u2019s identity, saying they were in touch with British authorities but unlikely to waive immunity in this case.\n\nNorthamptonshire police Superintendent Sarah Johnson said Saturday they are seeking to \u201callow for the arrest and formal interview of the subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry Dunn\u2019s family deserves justice, and in order to achieve this, a full and thorough investigation, with the assistance of all parties involved, needs to take place,\u201d she said.\n\nDunn\u2019s mother, Charlotte Charles, made a plea to Mr. Trump in a SkyNews interview asking for his help in bringing Ms. Sacoolas back to England.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, please listen. We\u2019re a family in ruin. We\u2019re broken. We can\u2019t grieve,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, please let her get back on a plane.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
