I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll see you in a couple of weeks. Bye.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019ll be enjoying the half-term holidays (Picture: Rex)\n\nThe ITV daytime series launched a Twitter poll on Monday (14 October) to see whether fans wanted to keep Piers on-screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the course of the past two days, 482,270 voted, with 60 per cent agreeing that the star should be booted off.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s now been hijacked by these snowflake websites and Twitter handles, so all last night they were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of him, get rid of him!\u201d, they actually think they can get rid of me,\u2019 Piers said ahead of the final results.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve now had over 300,000 votes, one of the biggest in the history of the show, and it\u2019s now moved 59% against me, now viewers, you\u2019re not the snowflake brigade, you are my people.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe added: \u2018You are my army, I need you to get busy this morning. We cannot let the snowflakes win.\u2019\n\nA further campaign emerged on Change.org calling for Piers\u2019 termination.\n\n\u2018Morgan dictates to his viewers that it\u2019s acceptable to deny an LGBTQ+ person of their rights; it\u2019s acceptable to tell them they don\u2019t exist; it\u2019s acceptable to call them \u201csnowflakes\u201d when they get rightfully upset,\u2019 part of the petition\u2019s description reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These are the lessons Morgan teaches. ITV, as a major broadcasting corporation with a worldwide reach, are currently tarnishing a long-lasting legacy by using one of their highest-performing programmes as a vehicle to spread hate and intolerance.\u2019\n\nAt the time of writing, 47,650 people have signed the other Change.org petition.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
