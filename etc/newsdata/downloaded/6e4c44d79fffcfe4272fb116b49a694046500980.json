But the base, which sits along a potential Iranian supply route through Iraq to Syria, has also become a critical buttress for combating Iranian influence in the region.\n\n\u201cAl-Tanf is a critical element in the effort to prevent Iran from establishing a ground line of communications from Iran through Iraq through Syria to southern Lebanon in support of Lebanese Hezbollah,\u201d said one former senior U.S. military commander.\n\nA U.S. presence at al-Tanf helps to block Iran\u2019s hopes for a \u201cShiite Crescent,\u201d a continuous land bridge from Iran through Iraq and Syria to Lebanon. From this position, Iran could threaten Israel.\n\nUnder the current withdrawal plan, the more than 200 U.S. troops who have been advising local Syrian fighters out of al-Tanf will be the last to leave the country, officials say. The vast majority of U.S. troops are concentrated in northeast Syria, hundreds of kilometers from al-Tanf. But given the garrison\u2019s strategic importance, sources said the U.S. government is considering a plan to keep at least some forces there.\n\nThe significance is not just the strategic location of al-Tanf itself but also a 55-kilometer exclusion zone, about 34 miles around the garrison, that allows U.S. troops to claim self-defense in striking Iranian or other forces moving through that area, said one source close to the discussions. Legally, the United States does not have the authority to attack a state actor such as Iran unprovoked.\n\n\u201cWhen they come through, we\u2019ve claimed, I think reasonably, that they\u2019ve been threatening either U.S. forces or partner forces,\u201d the source said.\n\nBut staying at al-Tanf could raise legal issues for the administration, said one U.S. government official. Experts have argued that the administration would be on shaky ground in using the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force\u2014which authorizes the fight against nonstate militant groups such as the Islamic State or al Qaeda in Afghanistan\u2014to justify maintaining a presence in Syria for any reason other than to fight the Islamic State.\n\nThe only \u201clogical purpose\u201d al-Tanf serves is to allow the United States to \u201cmonitor and disrupt the flow of Iranian-backed militias,\u201d the first source said.\n\n\u201cHonestly, you could not contrive a different military mission,\u201d the source said.\n\nAnother potential problem is that staying at al-Tanf goes against the president\u2019s initial orders\u2014to withdraw all U.S. forces from Syria. The president has said his only reason for having U.S. troops in Syria is to fight the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cHas the president actually approved that? All of his statements are to the contrary,\u201d the U.S. government source said.\n\nA Defense Department spokesman declined to comment on specific force movements.\n\n\u201cWe are focused on a deliberate, coordinated withdrawal from Syria. For operational security reasons, we are not going to discuss timelines or specific movements,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Sean Robertson said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lara Seligman", "Anis Modi", "Trita Parsi", "Stephen Wertheim", "Douglas J. Feith", "Abram N. Shulsky", "Stephen M.
