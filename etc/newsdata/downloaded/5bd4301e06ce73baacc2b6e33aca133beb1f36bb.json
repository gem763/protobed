The Texas Medical Association and the Medical Society of the State of New York have echoed the concern raised in the grassroots petition.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the problem with Section 5?\n\nDoctors, as veterans of healthcare battles in which unintended consequences and collateral damage abound, see Section 5 as a Trojan Horse crafted by special interests that seeks to increase the corporate consolidation of American healthcare, undermine competition, and fatten their own coffers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpecifically, Section 5 calls for pay parity under Medicare \u2014 more accurately, \u201creimbursement parity\u201d \u2014 between exhaustively trained physicians and less-trained (and sometimes very questionably-trained) mid-level providers \u2014 nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). Medicare dollars, and eventually all third-party payments for care, would be leveled (flattened) across physicians, NPs, and PAs.\n\nInevitably, Section 5 will accelerate the replacement of physicians by NPs and PAs, deepen \u201c DRexit ,\u201d and make it ultimately pointless to take on the rigorous challenges and debt of becoming a physician.\n\nIn this brave new world, it will be left to patients to figure out what has happened and to find providers with the level of training they prefer.\n\nAnd when it comes to costliness, here\u2019s the kicker: After Section 5 is fully implemented, in a world where there won\u2019t be much choice left, the choices that are left will actually drain more and more from the public treasury and private wallet.\n\nHow could that happen?\n\nAmerican healthcare is being consolidated. It\u2019s becoming corporate, \u201cbig-box,\u201d and anti-competitive.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe trend of consolidation has created two types of huge corporate players \u2014 regional hospital systems and pharmacy chains, such as Walgreens and CVS, that engage in more and more mergers and acquisitions.\n\nRegional hospital systems now employ the majority of the nation\u2019s physicians.\n\nThey swallow up independent competition and corner local markets.\n\nIt\u2019s already established that regional hospital monopolies have been a costly trend for the public.\n\nTheir behavior, in some cases, particularly their treatment of the disadvantaged, has shown a disturbing indifference to public welfare.\n\nThey collect equalized, leveled reimbursements from Medicare, and pay their employees from those revenues, at least in part.\n\nWhy, then, would they continue to pay the salaries of physicians, when they collect flat amounts for the same work from cheaper replacements?\n\nIn short, the large, regional hospital systems will be incentivized by Section 5 to replace physicians with mid-level providers who can be paid less. The trend is well under way.\n\nHuge pharmacy chains have used mid-level providers exclusively in their \u201chealth hubs.\u201d\n\nThey have been building alliances with Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), the entities who control which medications are covered by third-party payers.\n\nWe already know the following about PBMs: they collect legalized kickbacks, they help themselves to millions of Medicaid dollars, and their maneuvering puts independent pharmacies out of business as the big chains, allies to the PBMs, corner the market.\n\nAdd insurance companies into the mergers of the PBMs and the huge pharmacy chains, and what is the result? Corporate, healthcare-providing behemoths \u2014 vertically integrated and aligned organisms that will crush the last of the smaller, independent competition.\n\nWhen the interests of the prescriber, the authorizing party, the referring party, a third-party payer and the payee are all aligned, what happens?\n\nThe prescribing party over-prescribes. The authorizing party over-authorizes. The referring party over-refers.\n\nRevenues from the public purse will go up, up, up. Either taxes or debt will have to go up, up, up as a consequence.\n\nAnd when the expertise of the practitioners is in decline, costly blunders multiply. The question will no longer be, \u201cCan you keep your doctor?\u201d but \u201cCan you even find a properly trained doctor?\u201d\n\nAnd when costly blunders multiply and bad outcomes proliferate, litigiousness increases.\n\nIt won\u2019t be long before an abused public will see American healthcare in the same way that its sees Congress and the mass media.\n\nGiven that the public trusts the small and the independent more than the big corporations, does any of this make sense?\n\nThe incongruous Section 5, which will work against the rest of this latest executive order and earlier ones, will prove to be no winner. Its unintended consequences will make losers of us all.\n\nCaren Gallaher is a surgeon in Tennessee and co-founder of Physicians for Patients.", "description": "Trump's executive order will accelerate the replacement of physicians by less-costly \u2014 and less well-trained \u2014 NPs and PAs.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/healthcare_doctorsoffice_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
