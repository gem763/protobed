Mr. McLevish replaces acting CFO Mark George, who left to become CFO of railway operator Norfolk Southern Corp.\n\nMr. McLevish previously served as finance chief at drugstore operator Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., food maker Kraft Foods Group Inc. and manufacturing company Ingersoll Rand PLC, among other positions. Most recently, he served as senior adviser to Walgreens Chief Executive Stefano Pessina on strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nCarrier, with net sales of $18.9 billion in 2018, offers products and services ranging from air conditioning and refrigerated transport to building security, fire extinguishers and smoke detectors.\n\nThe company is in the process of separating from United Technologies, the industrial conglomerate that is breaking itself into three entities. After the split, slated to be completed in 2020, Carrier and the Otis elevator business will be separate firms, with United Technologies focusing on aerospace.\n\nCarrier is seeking approval from regulators on its future tax and capital structure and is setting up its own management and finance systems, United Technologies Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor conference Thursday.\n\n\u201cMost of the legal entity restructuring activities still have to occur,\u201d Mr. Hayes said, according to a transcript. \u201cBut the real sort of hard lifting is around the digital front. We\u2019re replicating the systems and all of that, hiring a bunch of people.\u201d\n\nAbout 600 consultants have been working on the separation since it was announced in November, according to Nigel Coe, a managing director at investment research firm Wolfe Research.\n\nUnited Technologies has forecast separation costs of about $1.5 billion for Carrier this year, part of which will be tax-related as the new company will no longer benefit from some of the conglomerate\u2019s tax arrangements.\n\nOnce Carrier has become a separate entity, management will train its lens on reviewing the company\u2019s portfolio, Mr. Coe said. That could lead to the sale of some assets, he said.\n\n\u201cThe appointment of Mr. McLevish reinforces the notion that substantial portfolio change will likely follow at Carrier following its spin out of United Technologies next year,\u201d said Julian Mitchell, an analyst at Barclays PLC.\n\nCarrier is emerging from United Technologies with about $12 billion to $14 billion in debt, and Mr. McLevish will be focused on bringing that down, Mr. Coe said. The ratio between debt and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the new company is expected to range from 3.0 times to 3.5 times, which is high for the industry, according to Mr. Coe.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply confident that he [Mr. McLevish] will help Carrier achieve our financial goals and position us to deliver strong value and growth for our shareholders,\u201d Carrier Chief Executive David Gitlin said in a statement.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "Carrier Global Corp. on Friday named a new finance chief, a move that comes as the heating-and-cooling-systems company prepares to spin off from United Technologies Corp. next year.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107143/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
