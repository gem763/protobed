The answer? Nothing.\n\n\u201cI went looking on the network,\u201d Snowden said, and there was no evidence that the government is hiding evidence of intelligent alien life. \u201cI had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, CIA, military, all these groups \u2014 I couldn\u2019t find anything. If it\u2019s hidden, and it could be hidden, it\u2019s hidden really damn well, even from people who are on the inside.\u201d\n\nEdward Snowden searched through the CIA's secret databases for proof of alien life pic.twitter.com/JvQDKlv96O \u2014 The Independent (@Independent) October 24, 2019\n\nSnowden also addressed the issue in his book, Permanent Record, which came out last month. \u201cFor the record, as far as I could tell, aliens have never contacted Earth, or at least they haven\u2019t contacted US intelligence,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSnowden\u2019s inability to find proof of alien life on the intelligence networks doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist, he said. Aliens \u201cprobably are\u201d out there, he told Rogan. There\u2019s just no proof the U.S. government is hiding that from us (but there are plenty of other reasons to believe).\n\nThe alien information, or lack thereof, is the most compelling news Snowden has made on his book tour, which kicked off last month with an appearance on CBS This Morning. Snowden, who is currently in exile in Russia, said he wants to come home.\n\n\u201cI would like to return to the United States,\u201d the North Carolina native said. \u201cThat is the ultimate goal. But if I\u2019m gonna spend the rest of my life in prison, the one bottom line demand that we have to agree to is that at least I get a fair trial.\u201d\n\nThe whistle-blower\u2019s book got a big boost by the Department of Justice the same day it was released. On September 17, the DOJ said in a lawsuit that Snowden violated nondisclosure agreements signed with the NSA and CIA. The goal of its lawsuit is not to stop Snowden\u2019s book from being sold, but rather to recoup all of its profits. \u201cIntelligence information should protect our nation, not provide personal profit,\u201d a government lawyer said. \u201cThis lawsuit will ensure that Edward Snowden receives no monetary benefits from breaching the trust placed in him.\u201d", "description": "The whistle-blower searched for evidence of aliens and found nothing, he said on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast.", "authors": ["Adam K.
