The U.S. and Poland have worked together to strengthen NATO deterrence, improve European energy security, and moving forward. possibly to enact measures to mitigate risks associated with next-generation telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nPoland was one of Trump\u2019s first overseas destinations in July 2017. In a speech in Warsaw\u2019s Krasi?ski Square, Trump delivered a seminal foreign policy address stressing the need for a robust western response to Russian aggression, and delivering a vigorous defense of the western values that underpin the transatlantic bond.\n\n\u201cOur own fight for the West does not begin on the battlefield\u2013it begins with our minds, our wills, and our souls,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 Our freedom, our civilization, and our survival depend on these bonds of history, culture, and memory.\u201d\n\nPoland has proven itself a valuable ally.\n\nIn 2018, Poland was one of only seven NATO allies who spent 2 percent of the gross domestic product on defense and one of 16 allies that reached the benchmark to spend 20 percent of their defense budget on equipment.\n\nPoland has prioritized the purchase of American equipment, including a $4.75 billion deal for two Patriot missile batteries, and a $414 million deal to purchase 20 high-mobility artillery rocket systems.\n\nIn May, Poland submitted a formal \u201cletter of request,\u201d to purchase 32 F-35s to replace its aging Soviet-era fighter force.\n\nThe Trump administration has maintained U.S. troops in Poland, serving as the framework nation in the country for NATO\u2019s Enhanced Forward Presence, a set of deployments agreed upon at the 2016 Warsaw Summit to deter further Russian aggression.\n\nFurthermore, under Trump, funding for exercises, infrastructure, training, and increased U.S. presence in Europe through the European Deterrence Initiative has nearly doubled from the final year of the Obama administration, with more than $6.5 billion in funding enacted for the initiative in fiscal year 2019.\n\nThe U.S. continues to rotate additional American forces in the form of an Armored Brigade Combat Team, an Aviation Brigade, and a logistical rotation to the continent. The headquarters and bulk of forces associated with the U.S. Armored BCT and Logistical rotations are based in Poland.\n\nIn June, Trump and Polish President Andrzej Duda signed an agreement strengthening security cooperation, and laying the groundwork for an additional rotational deployment of 1,000 American troops to Poland.\n\nThe two nations are expected to sign a more detailed memorandum regarding the new U.S. deployment, which the vice president could sign while in Warsaw.\n\nWarming U.S.-Polish relations in recent years has extended to the vital realm of energy security. Like the United States, Poland has firmly fought against the Nord Stream II pipeline, which would further entrench Russia\u2019s position in Europe\u2019s energy supply and geopolitical calculus for decades to come.\n\nAdditionally, Poland is working to diversify its own supply of energy, including with an LNG import terminal in ?winouj?ci, and a planned second LNG import terminal at Gdansk. Polish companies have also inked deals with U.S. companies to import American natural gas.\n\nThis weekend, the U.S. and Poland will begin addressing two glaring deficiencies in the bilateral relationship; the continued exclusion of Poland from the Visa Waiver Program and security concerns over China\u2019s threat to telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nThe Trump administration will reportedly nominate Poland for inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program, a U.S. program in which participating nations share information on serious criminals, terrorists, and lost and stolen passports with the U.S. in exchange for visa-free travel up to 90 days. While further action will be required to complete Poland\u2019s inclusion in Visa Waiver Program, the nomination, is an important signal that the administration views Poland\u2019s participation in Visa Waiver Program as a security benefit.\n\nFinally, in the coming days, the U.S. and Poland are expected to sign a 5G cooperation agreement, the threat from China to telecommunications infrastructure a continued focus of the Trump administration.\n\nIn Poland, Chinese company Huawei already controls over half of the nation\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nWhile the exact parameters of the new agreement have not been released, one Polish official was recently quoted as saying, \u201c5G will be too important security-wise to give it away to someone we don\u2019t fully trust.\u201d\n\nThat Warsaw is showing signs of aligning with Washington\u2019s thinking on 5G is a crucial policy victory, which could place pressure on other European allies to follow suit.\n\nTrump deserves credit for repairing U.S.-Polish relations, the fruits of which will be on display in the coming days as the two nations agree on new avenues of cooperation regarding 5G, energy, security, and visa waiver.\n\nThe degree to which each side follows through on these positive steps will determine to what degree posterity views robust U.S.-Polish relations as one of the administration\u2019s signature foreign policy achievements.", "description": "Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0will travel to Poland\u00a0this weekend to Poland in place of President Trump, who canceled his three-day visit on account of Hurricane Dorian\u2019s looming arrival in Florida.\u00a0\n\nDuring this visit, Pence is expected to announce measures that further solidify the U.S.-Polish bilateral relationship, the revitalization of which has proven one of the administration\u2019s most important policy achievements.", "authors": ["Daniel Kochis", "Senior Policy Analyst In European Affairs", "Daniel Kochis Is A Senior Policy Analyst In European Affairs In The Margaret Thatcher Center For Freedom."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-1124726148.jpg?itok=Xhavn-o0"}
