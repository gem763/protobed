Like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity citing the situation\u2019s sensitivity and a desire to be candid with their insights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe State Department defended the renovations, saying they were part of a \u201cregular 17-year cycle of reviewing and refreshing furnishings and interior d\u00e9cor in representational residences.\u201d The renovations were funded in April, after Sondland\u2019s confirmation, a spokesman said. \u201cOther minor renovations currently underway\u201d were reviewed and approved by staff at the U.S. mission and funded in fiscal 2019, which began in October, after Sondland was confirmed.\n\nTwo former U.S. officials said Sondland delighted in the trappings of being an American ambassador in Brussels.\n\n\u201cHe got addicted,\u201d one former official said. \u201cThe way you\u2019re treated as a senior U.S. official, there\u2019s nothing like it in terms of adrenaline and ego boost.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome of Sondland\u2019s colleagues said that, upon arriving in Brussels, he quickly became disappointed in his accommodations and, after unsuccessfully arguing to move to a new residence, began proposing renovations.\n\nAD\n\nThe residence, located in a leafy residential area in the Uccle section of Brussels, is not at the pinnacle of Brussels luxury standards, people who have spent time there said. But it was well-suited to its purpose \u2014 housing the ambassador and hosting working dinners and social affairs. Whitlock Hall, the residence for the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, is where American diplomats customarily hold major events.\n\nA person who has spoken to Sondland about the upgrades said the residence was \u201cdeteriorated and nearly unusable for representational purposes.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut others disputed this claim.\n\n\u201cBull----,\u201d said one person with extensive knowledge of the residence before Sondland arrived. \u201cThe house was in excellent condition.\u201d\n\nA former U.S. official also called claims of the home\u2019s disrepair \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe problem with [the residence] is mainly the location, very far from the center and completely inaccessible by public transit,\u201d the former official said. \u201cBut the physical state is fine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring the Obama administration, the house was used two to three nights a week for entertaining. \u201cThe gardens were superb, and it had a fantastic swimming pool. The facility is one of the most luxurious of any in Brussels,\u201d one person said.\n\nAD\n\nGuests often found themselves invited for dinner or receptions. Sondland\u2019s predecessor, Obama appointee Anthony Gardner, held annual July 4 parties there, as a brass band played and European bureaucrats, diplomats, business executives, academics and journalists chomped on hot dogs.\n\nSondland has called himself a \u201cdisruptive diplomat.\u201d In public appearances and in private meetings, he has often echoed the rhetoric of his boss, Trump, another hotel developer. Sondland once declared to American business representatives that unlike his predecessors he would \u201cget s--- done,\u201d according to people who were present. He called the E.U. \u201cout of touch\u201d and accused it of stalling on trade talks with the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\nProcurement records show that in the years before Sondland\u2019s arrival, the biggest expenses were for regular maintenance of the swimming pool, which cost between $15,000 and $20,000 per year, and for general upkeep and landscaping, save for a $122,000 purchase in 2015 for refrigeration equipment, apparently for the house\u2019s catering kitchen.\n\nAD\n\nUnder Sondland, however, the State Department has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on furniture, fabrics and what is described in documents as a \u201cfamily kitchen,\u201d at a cost of just under $223,000.\n\nThat project is distinct from another for a \u201cprofessional kitchen,\u201d costing about $209,000, the records show. Before Sondland\u2019s arrival, the home did not have a personal kitchen and ambassadors and their families would prepare their personal meals in the professional kitchen, according to people familiar with the residence.\n\nAD\n\nThe cost of the family kitchen was in line with high-end homes in Brussels, said Jorge Almada, a Brussels-based designer who has experience working on luxury projects.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in [New York City],\u201d Almada said in an email. \u201cThat price is within reason if it\u2019s all decked out with appliances. It\u2019s always the woodwork which is especially expensive.\u201d\n\nSome of the work at the residence seemed designed for the comfort of the occupant, not for making the house suitable for guests.\n\nThe records show $82,000 was spent on a bathroom renovation labeled \u201cbackside office.\u201d Renovation of a restroom in a vestibule, a more public space, cost about $54,000, the records show.\n\nSondland has also tried to upgrade the offices where he and the staff of the U.S. mission to the E.U. work, former officials and colleagues said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe had a weird obsession with creating a snack room after he visited Uber headquarters in the Bay Area,\u201d a former U.S. official said, referring to the ride-hail service headquartered in San Francisco.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was often trying to use his own money for renovations that weren\u2019t allowed,\u201d said the former official.\n\n\u201cHe had separate meetings on these issues with administrative services and procurement people,\u201d said another former official.\n\nSondland wouldn\u2019t be the first wealthy donor-turned-diplomat to try to spruce up his accommodations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual but not unheard of for ambassadors to pay for renovations with their own money,\u201d said Ron Neumann, the president of the American Academy of Diplomacy.\n\nThe lifestyle of well-heeled donors can sometimes create sticker shock when the expenses become public.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a multimillionaire used to doing these things for your own place, you might not look at the price tags the same way,\u201d Neumann said.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the work on the residence continues, a former official said, Sondland is staying at a hotel. The person described the hotel as \u201cnot the nicest in Brussels, but one of the nicer ones.\u201d", "description": "The project includes a $209,000 professional kitchen and a $223,000 family kitchen.", "authors": ["Michael Birnbaum", "Brussels Bureau Chief Covering Europe", "Shane Harris", "Intelligence", "National Security Reporter", "John Hudson", "National Security Reporter Focusing On The State Department"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bvP_GO03PaskRK0yOwTm76Rw7MI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/73IN2JXQL4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
