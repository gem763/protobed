Making that happen is a key part of our relationship with them.\n\n'Assuming Canelo comes through the challenge of Kovalev, which is no safe assumption because it is a hell of a test against a light-heavyweight at the top of his game, we will sit down and discuss the plan for 2020.'\n\nCanelo defeated Golovkin last year following a contentious draw the first time around", "description": "The rivals were involved in two epic encounters in 2017 and 2018, with Canelo claiming victory in the rematch after draw.
