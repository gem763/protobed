Polly Toynbee tweeted: \u201cRuth Davidson does a disservice to mothers: many do very well in politics. Covering her resignation with \u2018motherhood\u2019 excuses is deeply depressing.\u201d\n\nI know from experience that stepping out of the door to go to work and closing it while your baby wails for you is also deeply depressing.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not all about the baby, but so what if there is an element of \u201chold on now this is one sacrifice too many\u201d? Most parents who are in all-consuming jobs, where the working day isn\u2019t over until it\u2019s over, can recognise the moment when you realise that the position you have, what you have worked to build, is simply not worth sacrificing seeing your lovely squishy baby for.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSo you want to take your foot off the gas, but realising this and actually doing it are two different things, especially when your job is so much a part of your identity and one that you cannot do part-time. So many career women feel the responsibility to be seen as someone whose work is not hindered by motherhood. Toynbee\u2019s attitude comes from a place where all feminists, myself included, want women to have equal representation in positions of power, and get the support they need to bear and raise their children as well as holding leadership positions. I get that. But as a feminist, I support and respect any woman\u2019s decision to change her direction \u2013 to halt and reassess what is best for her.\n\nWhat does disappoint me is to see people accusing Davidson of using motherhood as an \u201cexcuse\u201d to bow out. Most of us have defaulted to the old \u201ccouldn\u2019t get a babysitter\u201d line to swerve a party that we were too tired to go to, but it\u2019s a bigger leap to imagine a woman using her baby as a mere excuse to bow out of a job she has dedicated eight years of her life to. That does a disservice to women, and is deeply depressing.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Top 20 most admired women in 2019 Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Getty Images for Stuart Weitzman\n\nMy own feet did not touch the ground after I had babies. Four weeks after a C-section, I was up on stage at the Latitude Festival. I was trying so hard to prove to my industry that, despite having just had a baby, I was still in the game. I was praised for working so hard when my babies were small \u2013 told that I was working for them, that I was setting such a good example, that I was a strong working mum \u2013 but not seeing my children didn\u2019t feel like strength. Sometimes I was rushing around so much that I wanted to just collapse face down in a puddle. Often I was so tired that, when I was with my children, I was no fun.\n\nI know that, for many of us, it is not an option to slow down. Not everyone has choices in their career or is in a financial position to give up a job or go part-time to be with our children more. I don\u2019t think the position of leader of the Scottish Tories was a job Ruth Davidson saw advertised online and applied for on a whim; likewise, turning her back on it was not something she did because she didn\u2019t fancy the hard work anymore. But it\u2019s not her job, or any woman\u2019s job, to stay in a position that is making her unhappy in order to set an example others want.\n\nI know talking about parents who work (let\u2019s face it, mothers who work) is a minefield. Whatever you say, some people will immediately think that you\u2019re accusing them of not being a good enough mother, and I know this because I myself am \u201csome people\u201d. I have bitten the head off anyone who has offered unsolicited opinions on my work-life balance or, to be fair, just suggested I sit down for a moment and have a cup of tea (\u201cAs if I have TIME for TEA!\u201d). When you\u2019re swept up in a whirl of work and home responsibilities, loving care is not always immediately appreciated.\n\nBut sometimes it feels like we fetishise \u201chard work\u201d and play down the joys of life with our children, who are little for such a small amount of time.\n\nTwo years ago, my daughter, aged four, started to do impersonations of all our friends and family. They were sweet and hilarious until someone said \u201cdo mummy\u201d. She thought for a split-second, then rushed around the room, blowing kisses and saying \u201cBye! Bye! Mummy\u2019s got to go! BYE! BYE! BYE!\u201d. That was it. That was the way my four-year-old child saw me, her mother: the woman who is always leaving, always saying goodbye.\n\nAt the moment, I am my children\u2019s favourite person to hang out with, but I know that\u2019s not going to last forever, so I made changes, which I was lucky to be able to.\n\nDavison clearly got to a point where enough was enough and the sacrifice was too great. Giving up the \u201ctop job\u201d does not mean that she\u2019s giving up on politics and everything she\u2019s fought to achieve. She did not do mothers a \u201cdisservice\u201d. Actually, she showed us that she had the strength to admit that this was not how she wanted her life to be, and not to be railroaded by the judgement of others or the expectations of the Polly Toynbees of this world. She liberated herself. She chose to shape her world as she wanted. She chose life.", "description": "Ruth Davidson\u2019s resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives sent some into a flurry of speculation that she was, perhaps, using her family \u2013 mostly her baby boy \u2013 as an excuse to get out of serving a prime minister she would presumably happily smear with the contents of a nappy.
