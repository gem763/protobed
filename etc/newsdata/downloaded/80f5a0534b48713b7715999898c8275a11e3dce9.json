Their Premier League form has nosedived this year, with just five wins from their last 20 games \u2013 hardly a run of results befitting their top-four status. There are mitigating circumstances for running out of steam last season, with injuries, fatigue and the Champions League distraction among them, but their slump has carried over to the new campaign.\n\nThey have won just two of their opening six top-flight games, drew at Olympiacos in the Champions League and then suffered the embarrassment of a Carabao Cup defeat to a side 71 places below them in the football pyramid.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That saw them lose 1-0 to Newcastle, labour to a 0-0 draw at Colchester and need two late goals to beat Aston Villa.\n\nBrittle at the back?\n\nSpurs\u2019 stingy defence used to be the foundation of their success \u2013 they conceded only 29 times in the 2016-17 Premier League season. But, even though four of the back five remain the same, they have become very leaky this term.\n\nIn addition, they have been flaky when holding onto a lead. Twice they have drawn games from 2-0 up and they lost at Leicester having led 1-0 going into the final quarter.\n\nA six-year itch?\n\nPochettino is now in his sixth season at the helm, and nine of his current strongest starting XI were in the side that challenged Leicester for the 2015-16 title.\n\nThere has been virtually no turnover of the squad in recent years and there is a chance that it has all gone a bit stale for both the players and the manager.\n\nThe players have been listening to the same man giving the same message for several years, and Pochettino has been unable to freshen up his squad in the way he would have liked. He spoke about the possibility of leaving the club had they won the Champions League.\n\nPA", "description": "Tottenham\u2019s difficult start to the season continued on Tuesday as they were dumped out of the Carabao Cup on penalties by League Two Colchester.
