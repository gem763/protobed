The group falls under the Syrian National Army, an umbrella group fighting alongside Turkish armed forces in northeastern Syria.\n\nA State Department spokesman, speaking on background, said Tuesday that reports of the killing of Khalaf and several captured SDF fighters were \u201cextremely troubling, reflecting the overall destabilization of northeast Syria since the commencement of hostilities.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest of terms any mistreatment and extrajudicial execution of civilians or prisoners, and are looking further into these circumstances,\u201d the spokesman added.\n\nIn Khalaf\u2019s memorial service Sunday in Malikiyah, also known as Derik, her mother noted that her daughter had three degrees: civil engineering, English and Kurdish. \u201cBut my daughter was not satisfied with these diplomas and decided to participate in building Syria,\u201d she said, according to an official statement issued by the party.\n\n\u201cMy daughter Hevrin today got the highest of degrees: She was martyred for the sake of the people and the homeland and the cause,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nNoubhar Mustafa, a roommate and colleague of Khalaf, remembered her as \u201cbeautiful, quiet, kind, compassionate.\u201d\n\nMustafa said: \u201cShe got emotional about mothers\u2019 suffering. She got emotional about women\u2019s suffering. They would come to our center in Raqqa; she would listen to their stories and despite the fact that she\u2019s a political figure, her human and compassionate side took over.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Center for Studies and Protection of Women\u2019s Rights in Syria also paid tribute, saying: \u201cHevrin Khalaf was not a fighter fighting in the ranks of the Syrian Democratic Forces or others. She was a Syrian citizen and a civil engineer who worked to serve her homeland, Syria.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat she was exposed to, a barbaric murder at the hands of Erdogan\u2019s lackeys, only reveals the malice of these groups and their lack of humanity,\u201d it said.\n\nThe killing is under investigation by Ahrar al-Sharqiya, said Ziad al-Khalaf, a member of the group.\n\nBut Khalaf told The Washington Post that \u201cuntil now, there has been no proof\u201d that a member of the group was responsible for the killing.\n\nHassan al-Shami, a spokesman for the group, said Hevrin Khalaf was not a politician but an agent of U.S. intelligence, noting that her party was established on Washington\u2019s orders.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe in Ahrar al-Sharqiya and other Syrian National Army factions are partaking in the Peace Spring Operation with the Turkish brothers. The aim of this operation is combating terrorism. . . . If we find a terrorist or a spy, what do you expect us to do?\u201d the spokesman told The Post.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe day she was killed, she was on the 712 road,\u201d said Youssef Hammoud, a spokesman for the Syrian National Army. \u201cThat is tens of kilometers away from the M4\u201d \u2014 a highway that the National Army said it had reached during the fighting.\n\nAsser Khattab in Beirut contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "Kurds call Hevrin Khalaf\u2019s death a war crime and blame Turkish-backed Islamist fighters.", "authors": ["Sarah Dadouch", "Correspondent Covering The Middle East"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/94pFNd2UUf9qZianbLKOt1GpeTs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N3GMOSXPLII6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
