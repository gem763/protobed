Maggs has since shared a picture of himself and posted a screengrab of a story about the attack on Instagram.\n\nDanny Maggs\u2019 mother Rachel, who is on holiday in Malta, told Daily Mail the family were in shock over the news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in shock and we\u2019re thousands of miles away so can\u2019t do much at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are hoping for the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds as though the young man with Danny has come off worst but we don\u2019t know the full extent of Danny\u2019s injuries yet. We are hoping both of them will be ok.\u201d\n\nHis grandmother, Jean Anning said her daughter was in a \u201cstate of shock\u201d over her son\u2019s injuries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s waiting to see how bad the injury is to his calf and if there is any sort of damage to any tendons,\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all hoping that he makes a full recovery as it sounds like a nasty attack and I\u2019m just thankful it wasn\u2019t a lot worse,\u201d she said.\n\nMeanwhile, a Taiwanese tourist has described the terrifying moment two British men were attacked in front of her.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old exchange student, Chien Wang, was on-board the ZigZag Whitsundays boat tour to Whitehaven Beach when she heard one of the men shout \u201cshark, shark\u201d from the water.\n\n\u201cAt first I found it not really serious. Then he kept shouting. Everyone seemed to be scared,\u201d Ms Wang told the Whitsunday Times.\n\nShe said she could see blood in the water as staff rushed to help the men, and about 10 people had still been swimming at the time.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think there would be any sharks in that area,\u201d she said.\n\nThere were 20 people on board the tour boat but it remains unclear how many were in the water at the time, or what type of shark attacked.\n\nQueensland Ambulance Service Mackay manager of operations Tracey Eastwick said the two men were administered first aid by two international paramedics who just happened to be on-board the boat.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve applied tourniquets to both patients and continued treatment into Coral Sea Marina,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Raddon and Mr Maggs were then taken back to shore, where they were met by ambulance workers and eventually flown to hospital in Mackay.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened to confirm that two of our guests were injured in a shark attack this morning,\u201d ZigZag Whitsunday wrote on Facebook.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts are with them, their families and the other guests on the tour \u2026 We are working with authorities to assist in any way we can.\u201d\n\nIt is understood the two men were wrestling and thrashing about in the water when they were attacked by the shark.\n\nQueensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the two men, who are now in a stable condition, would get the \u201cbest care possible\u201d.", "description": "British tourist Danny Maggs has been pictured smiling and doing a \u201chang loose\u201d sign as he was loaded into a medical helicopter after suffering a shark attack off Whitsunday Island on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Staff Writers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/497ee3d3c531bbc545de178b0dd1195c?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
