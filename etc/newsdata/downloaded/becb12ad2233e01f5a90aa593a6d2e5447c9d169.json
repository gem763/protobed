But as of next month, the Falkland Islands will be a little easier to visit, thanks to the launch of a new flight to the archipelago's Mount Pleasant airport from Sao Paulo.\n\nAs of November 6, LATAM - the major airline created in 2012 by the merger of Brazil's TAM Linhas A\u00e9reas and Chile's LAN Airlines - will fly this 2,060-mile journey south from Brazil's largest metropolis, departing from the city's vast Guarulhos International Airport for the remote landing strip also known as RAF Mount Pleasant.\n\nAlthough only scheduled to depart once a week, the connection will bring the Falklands \"closer\" to a wide range of cities in Europe. LATAM Brasil flies directly to Heathrow, as well as Madrid, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan and Lisbon, from Sao Paulo - while British Airways offers a non-stop service to Guarulhos from Heathrow. Virgin Atlantic is due to begin a service between the same two airports in March 2020.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chris Leadbeater", "Travel Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/June/falklands-beach-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
