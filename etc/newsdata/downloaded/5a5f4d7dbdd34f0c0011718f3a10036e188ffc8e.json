While the MPP policy violates the rights of all subjected to it, the adverse effects of this policy is particularly acute among vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women. [Emphasis added] \u2026 DHS has returned a significant number of pregnant women to Mexico under MPP, exposing them to further harm in a particularly dangerous regions. DHS is returning pregnant women to places that are considered extremely dangerous \u2014 Baja California, Tamaulipas, and Chihuahua, among others. [Emphasis added]\n\nLike the ACLU, elected Democrats have demanded the release of all pregnant migrants into the U.S. In August, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) sent a letter to DHS requesting that pregnant migrants be fast-tracked into the country while they await their asylum hearings.\n\nPregnant migrant women take the dangerous journey through Central America and Mexico in the hopes of being released into the U.S. to deliver their babies and secure their children birthright American citizenship. The U.S.-born children of illegal aliens are often referred to as \u201canchor babies\u201d as they anchor their illegal parents in the country.\n\nToday, there are at least 4.5 million anchor babies in the U.S., exceeding the annual roughly four million American babies born every year and costing American taxpayers about $2.4 billion per year to subsidize hospital costs. Every year, about 300,000 anchor babies are born and as of June, there has been an average of about 124,000 anchor babies already born this year.\n\nTrump\u2019s Remain in Mexico policy, thus far, has probably prevented mass asylum fraud whereby migrants would have otherwise been released into the U.S. despite not being eligible for asylum. As of June, zero of the 1,200 migrants awaiting asylum in Mexico were found to be eligible.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
