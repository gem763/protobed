Our job as a parent is to coach them and teach them to do these things effectively and correctly.'\n\nDr Damon Korb (pictured), from California, said parents should set their kids up to become 'independent thinkers' and 'problem solvers' - and it all starts with their lunches\n\nWhat are the things five year olds should do on their own? Pick out their own clothes\n\nGet ready for bed\n\nBrush their teeth\n\nPut on their pajamas\n\nUse the bathroom\n\nBy the time a child turns 10, he said they should be able to make their own breakfast and lunch, manage daily homework without supervision and find ways to entertain themselves.\n\nDr Korb said parents should also let their children be bored so they can make their own creative games.\n\n'Parents these days are afraid of their kids being bored so we pacify them by putting electronics in front of them or letting them watch millions of TV channels', he said.\n\n'But the reality is kids are best served going outside with a stick and a ball - and try to figure out what to do. Learning how to be creative and learning how to be imaginative are skills that we use to build problem solving abilities they would use later in life.'\n\nFor his advice to parents, Dr Korb said: 'Learning happens by experiencing and making mistakes, and if we're doing everything for our kids, we're depriving them of their opportunity to learn.'", "description": "American Dr Damon Korb has told an Australian show parents should stop packing school lunches for their children after they turn eight so they can learn how to do things on their own.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/04/19424952-0-image-a-133_1570503981056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
