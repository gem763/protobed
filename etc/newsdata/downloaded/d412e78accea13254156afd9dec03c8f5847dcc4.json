Tyson Fury's WWE crossover lambasted by fans (VIDEO)\n\nMany were quick to condemn the one-time unified world heavyweight champion competing in a scripted wrestling contest versus a man whose greatest achievements are a few 1st place finishes in strongman events.\n\nBut it could make sense. Fury is set to pocket an estimated $15 million for his sports entertainment bow debut his eye is healing from a horror gash suffered in his 12-round decision win over Swede Otto Wallin in his last fight, where he suffered an eye injury which also needs time to heal before a date with the hardest puncher in the division.\n\nSceptics say that he may receive or even fake an injury that could rule him out of a lucrative rematch and much-anticipated match with Wilder, and force him to again sit on the periphery of the heavyweight scene.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, the 250 lbs 6ft 9in Fury announced he could also make his MMA debut before the year is out, being trained by Conor McGregor, to which The Notorious agreed in principle. In response, RT Sport have put together some mouth-watering fantasy fights in wrestling and MMA involving the Gypsy King.\n\nMike Tyson\n\nThe age-old fantasy fight usually pits a current elite heavyweight against a former champion from a bygone era. However, it\u2019s rare that two champs decades apart mirror each other in name and achievements in the sport.\n\nBorn in 1988, Tyson Fury was named after then-heavyweight ruler Mike Tyson, on account of his fighting spirit as an infant. Fury has gone some way to emulating his namesake by holding the same championship Tyson won aged 20, becoming the youngest holder of the heavyweight title.\n\nFury has now followed Tyson into the WWE. \u2018Iron Mike\u2019 was in full and electrifying \u2018Baddest Man on the Planet\u2019 mode when he made his WWE bow at WrestleMania XIV in 1998, serving as special enforcer and flattening \u2018Stone Cold\u2019 Steve Austin with a push when the latter flipped him the bird, later teaming with D-Generation X and sparking Shawn Michaels out cold.\n\nAny boxing fans would love to see the raw ferocity of Tyson versus the slick boxing brain of Fury, but a WWE match up would be pure box office.\n\nChael Sonnen\n\nIf there was one opponent that could tempt \u2018The Bad Guy\u2019 out of apparently blissful retirement, it could be Fury himself. Former UFC favorite and \u2018All-American Gangster\u2019 Sonnen has already had his say on Fury\u2019s reported move to MMA by saying that although he doesn\u2019t believe the Manchester man\u2019s words, he wouldn't doubt them.\n\n\u201cNo there is no part of me that believes he\u2019s going to do that. But my days of challenging crazy statements by Tyson Fury that he then goes out and does are long behind me,\u201d Sonnen said on his eponymously named podcast.\n\nHis reasoning? \u201cTyson Fury is another animal...the fine line of \u2018genius\u2019 and \u2018insanity - he's on 'genius' but it's a fine line!\u201d Sonnen went onto say that Fury possesses the work ethic to make it in mixed martial arts, despite only having, albeit very significant, boxing experience.\n\nSonnen\u2019s resume is a who\u2019s who of box office names in MMA and Fury\u2019s would perhaps be the most well-known of those and a welcome addition to that list alongside the likes of Quinton Jackson, Wanderlei Silva and fellow Brit Michael Bisping.\n\nStipe Miocic\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like a straight \u2018best v best\u2019 matchup and Tyson Fury and Stipe Miocic would be a clash of perhaps the best heavyweight in boxing pitted against the widely-recognized greatest mixed martial arts heavyweight ever.\n\nMiocic snatched the title back from highly respected Daniel Cormier in their rematch in August, that made him a two-time champion and catapulted him back into the big time within the promotion after almost becoming a forgotten man.\n\nIt\u2019s a scrap of two genuine working class men; Fury comes from gyspy stock, the son of Irish immigrants and the descendent of a long line of bare-knuckle travelling fighters; Miocic also is the son of immigrants, from Croatia, and had a blue-collar upbringing in Ohio, where he still moonlights as a firefighter.\n\nA title for lineal salt-of-the-earth champion would draw in the crowds - as if it needed any more promotion - for Tyson\u2019s mma debut.\n\nConor McGregor\n\nIf there was one fight in pugilistic heaven that could be made it would be 'The Gypsy King' versus 'The Notorious' himself. The two snappiest of dressers, the trashiest of trash talkers, the motor-mouths of the world of sport would be a fight for the ages.\n\nThe onus would be on Fury for this one; Conor already made the move into the squared circle, and now it\u2019s Fury\u2019s turn to purportedly swap gloves and climb into the cage. However, if this was ever likely, it would probably happen under the bright lights of WWE.\n\nSize-difference has rarely ever influenced a dream match in WWE and a Fury-McGregor double-header would be akin to Floyd Mayweather Jr\u2019s scuffle with The Big Show in a no holds barred clash at WrestleMania 24 in 2008.\n\nEarlier, the self-proclaimed \u2018TBE\u2019 broke the 7 ft 2 in Show\u2019s nose at WWE No Way Out in a seemingly unscripted row, but a repeat of such David and Goliath antics would be out of the question this time around, but would perhaps be the single most talked-about punch landed in the internet era.\n\nWe know this one is about as unlikely as a Christmas card from Khabib to Conor but it\u2019s worth thinking about - even if for those outfits and press conference soundbites.", "description": "The 'Gypsy King' Tyson Fury revently announced tongue-in-cheek he would make his MMA debut, after making his WWE bow on Nov. 2.
