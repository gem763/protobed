The Champions League could go very, very badly for Chelsea. AFP/Getty Images 20/33 14. Ajax Last year's semi-finalists, although they were made to sweat in qualifying this time around, and have lost star players Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt. AFP/Getty Images 21/33 13. Napoli Dark horses part one. Kostas Manolas and Kalidou Koulibaly might be the best centre-half pairing in the competition, and they have plenty of attacking resources from which to draw. AFP/Getty Images 22/33 12. RB Leipzig Dark horses part two. The installation of Julian Naglesmann as manager will further stimulate a squad that, if it clicks, can cause serious damage.

Diego Godin could be talismanic. Getty Images 24/33 10. Tottenham Hotspur Calm yourselves, Spurs fans, but it is hard not to forecast a regression to something resembling the mean. Rode their luck a bit last time out all the way to the final, and already flirting with a soft implosion. They may yet turn it around, of course. Getty Images 25/33 9. Atletico Madrid Probably not Atletico's year given the summer talent drain, but Diego Simeone's ability to grind out wins cannot be fully discounted. Getty Images 26/33 8. Bayern Munich Interesting defensive additions, but probably another year or two away from re-assembling themselves for another proper tilt for the crown. Bongarts/Getty Images 27/33 7. Borussia Dortmund Dortmund above Bayern? Yep! Lucien Favre is putting something special together. The re-signing of Mats Hummels shores up an inexperienced defence. Bongarts/Getty Images 28/33 6. PSG Neymar leaving could be a blessing in disguise, should he indeed depart for Barcelona, with the forward line's roles better clarified and Kylian Mbappe fulfilling his destiny as a super-club's key player. AFP/Getty Images 29/33 5. Real Madrid It could all come tumbling down in Madrid this year, but do not rule out Zinedine Zidane cobbling together a meaningful Champions League run from a squad that has plenty of pure talent. AFP/Getty Images 30/33 4. Juventus The Ronaldo project worked, to some extent, in year one, and Juventus are making the right moves to improve the team around him and properly contend in the Champions League this year. Matthijs De Ligt's development will be fun to watch, though Maurizio Sarri's rigidity may hinder the Italians. AFP/Getty Images 31/33 3. Liverpool Right in the mix, again. Jurgen Klopp's side are possibly due a slightly less successful campaign, though, and an injury drastically alters the appearance of such a settled lineup in key areas. Getty Images 32/33 2. Barcelona Lionel Messi wants another Champions League. That should be reason enough to rank Barcelona this highly, even after their recent misfires. Antoine Griezmann has arrived, Neymar may be on his way, Frenkie De Jong is the best young player in Europe - this might just be the Catalans' year. Getty Images 33/33 1. Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways.

Manchester City Pep Guardiola's City tenure will not feel fully complete without taking them to the top of the Champions League mountain, and they are shaping as favourites, with squad depth, consistency and an ability to rip teams apart in four or five different ways. Getty Images\n\nAlthough Brighton forward Florin Andone took advantage of continuing defensive issues to head home from close range and make for a nervous closing stages, over the 90 minutes Spain were much the better team. And a big improvement from when a mixed performance was flattered by a 3-0 scoreline at home to Sweden last June.\n\nAlthough there remain plenty of things to work on, a new cohesive side is coming together after what has now been six years of transitioning forward from the team of 2008 to 2012.\n\nOnly untouchable captain Ramos, Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and, most surprisingly, Jesus Navas remain from that \u2018golden generation\u2019. Spain\u2019s most effective player on Thursday night was Arsenal\u2019s Dani Ceballos \u2013 who marked his seventh senior cap by both drawing the foul for the penalty, and playing a superb pass to open up Romania\u2019s defence for the second.\n\nAlongside Ceballos in midfield against Romania was his fellow European Under-21 championships winner this summer Fabian Ruiz of Napoli. The functional 4-0 win over the Faroes on Sunday in Gijon also saw playing time for their contemporaries Mikel Oyarzabal (Real Sociedad), Rodrigo Hernandez (Man City) and Unai Nunez (Athletic Bilbao). Another member of what in Spain is called the \u20181996 generation\u2019 is Real Madrid\u2019s currently injured winger Marco Asensio.\n\nThis group have now overtaken the players previously expected to be the core of Spain\u2019s next great team. Although David De Gea, Dani Caravajal and Thiago Alcantara started against the Faroes, they are no longer members of Moreno\u2019s strongest XI. Neither Koke nor Alvaro Morata have even made recent squads, while Isco is another whose career looks to be heading the wrong way long before he reaches 30.\n\nAble to walk unrecognised down most Spanish streets until very recently, Moreno has settled confidently into a job he admits he never expected to be given. Barcelona born, he got his first coaching badges aged just 18, then worked his way through Catalan youth and amateur football into the La Masia academy, where he first met Luis Enrique in 2010. The pair then worked together for nearly a decade through Barcelona B, Roma, Celta Vigo, Barca\u2019s first team and Spain.\n\nAlong the way Moreno also wrote a book explaining his tactical ideas called \u2018My 4-4-2 recipe\u2019, and gained a reputation as a methodical thinker and planner. Given his lack of playing or managerial CV he knows he must win arguments by persuasion and reason.\n\n\u201cAuthority has to be earned, not imposed,\u201d he told El Pais recently. \u201cIf one day I tell a player to do something just because I want him to, I will have failed. I don\u2019t accept imposed authority myself. If a player asks me one day who I have played against, I won\u2019t be able to answer him back. But that is the easy answer, that\u2019s what you say when you don\u2019t have any other response.\u201d\n\nMoreno\u2019s biggest call so far has been to drop Manchester United\u2019s De Gea, whose confidence appeared shot after a string of high-profile mistakes. Kepa has looked very solid so far \u2013 and his superb reflex save to deny Reading\u2019s George Puscas a late equaliser on Thursday was further confirmation that the Basque is now Spain\u2019s number one.\n\nThe most pressing issue now is to find a replacement for Gerard Pique, who spent last week in New York promoting his new version of tennis\u2019 Davis Cup tournament, having retired from international football following last summer\u2019s World Cup. Real Sociedad\u2019s Diego Llorente struggled against Romania and was shown a straight red card for a professional foul on Andone. Atletico\u2019s summer signing Mario Hermoso played against the Faroes, but has had an unsteady start at this new club.\n\nYoungsters Ceballos and Fabian have brought energy and trickery to midfield, although veteran Busquets is for now still ahead of Rodrigo in the holding role. Up front Alcacer scored twice late off the bench against the Faroes, taking him to 12 goals in his first 17 caps, and his clever movement makes him a better fit for Spain than Morata or Diego Costa.\n\nGiven his Camp Nou past, Moreno is understandably keen not to be seen to favour Barcelona\u2019s players or style. He has mentioned all of Johann Cruyff, Pep Guardiola, Diego Simeone and Jurgen Klopp as influences, and Spain\u2019s display in Bucharest was quite reminiscent of the Luis Enrique adaptation of Guardiola\u2019s Barca which won the treble in 2015. This Spain want to dominate possession, of course they do, but they also press high and aim to be more direct.\n\nBoth full-backs Alba and Navas were inside the Romania penalty area during the multi-pass move leading to Alcacer\u2019s clincher in that game, while Busquets was breaking forward and having shots on goal at 2-0 up. This would never have happened during the days that Vicente Del Bosque\u2019s side were almost invincible but also super cautious.\n\nUnder Del Bosque, Spain always had a big Barcelona core, then Julen Lopetegui\u2019s side for World Cup 2018 was heavy on Real Madrid players. But Moreno is taking a very different approach. The team-sheet against Romania had names drawn from 10 different clubs \u2013 which had never before happened in a competitive Spain team. The most recent squad has representation from seven Spanish clubs, three in England and Italy, two in Germany and one in France. It goes against a trend in international football, perhaps, but the wide spread of clubs and leagues seems to bring a better balance both on and off the pitch.\n\nWithin Spanish football there is always the possibility of infighting messing things up, and Moreno has felt the need to publicly support Spanish federation president Luis Rubiales in his personal battle against La Liga counterpart Javier Tebas. That may be understandable as Rubiales is his boss, but hopefully petty political squabbles can be avoided ahead of next summer\u2019s tournament, where Spain will play some games in the Bilbao home city of now disgraced former federation chief Angel Maria Villar.\n\nLeaving those concerns aside for now, Spain can wrap up qualification during games away in Norway and Sweden next month. Moreno is a very unlikely La Roja national coach, but he seems keen to make an immediate impression.", "description": "A new Spain\u00a0team may finally be emerging from the shadow of their all-conquering predecessors of a decade ago, with rookie La Roja national coach Robert\u00a0Moreno having shown a careful but decisive hand during the opening weeks of his first senior management job of any sort. Six points from this week\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifiers against Romania and the Faroe Islands means that Spain", "authors": ["Dermot Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/12/robert-moreno--0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
