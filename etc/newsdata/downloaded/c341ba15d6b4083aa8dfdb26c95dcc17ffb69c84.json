The elaborate National Day celebrations, held in Tiananmen Square and some Chinese territories to a smaller extent, have prompted protesters to call for marches across the city. Some protester groups have called for Tuesday marches to be marked as a \u201cDay of Grief.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the press on Monday in both Chinese and English, police said the city was on the verge of \u201cextreme danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter our analysis, we\u2019re expecting the situation tomorrow to be very, very dangerous,\u201d said Chief Superintendent John Tse Chun-chung.\n\nThe superintendent also claimed, without providing evidence, that intelligence pointed to protesters planning extreme measures for upcoming protests.\n\n\u201cWe have got intelligence suggesting that some hardcore violence protesters are inciting others, including those with suicidal tendencies, to commit extreme acts like murdering the police, disguising as police officers to kill others, and setting fires to petrol stations, etc.,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWith the increase in the intensity and extensity of violence over the last three months, there are apparent signs that hardcore violence will escalate in the near future. All acts are one step closer to terrorism,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more: Protesters in Hong Kong may have almost won this battle \u2013 but the fight for freedom and identity is far from over\n\nPolice also displayed propaganda posters and video previously touted by Chinese state media asserting that Hong Kong protesters planned to kill civilians and officers.\n\nSeveral protest leaders dismissed the claims as fearmongering. Pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo called the police claims a \u201cjoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Chinese propaganda at play,\u201d she said, according to Associated Press. \u201cThe goal is to institute fear in society so that people will be scared to go out. This is a despicable tactic.\u201d\n\nThe Civil Human Rights Front, an activist group behind many previous sanctioned protests, had planned a peaceful march for Tuesday but had their permit request rejected. The group said the march was meant to be a \u201clegal and safe\u201d demonstration.\n\nProtests in the Chinese territory have entered into their seventeenth week and have, in some cases, led to violent clashes with police. Thousands of protesters rallied on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the largest pro-democracy protests the city had seen until this summer. Fringe groups of protesters hurled Molotov cocktails at police, who responded by firing tear gas and water cannons.\n\nViolent demonstrations continued in the city on Sunday, and rallies were held across Hong Kong, as well as in cities around the world in a show of solidarity. Forty-eight people were sent to the hospital Sunday, the city\u2019s Hospital Authority said, and over 100 protesters were arrested, the South China Morning Post reported, citing police sources.\n\nHong Kong police have been accused of brutality and the unlawful arrests of protesters. A top police commander told foreign media last month that officers fear that they may need to use lethal force as protests continue to escalate.\n\n\u201c[The officers\u2019] greatest fear is that they might have to kill someone or that they might be killed themselves \u2013 it is really that critical,\u201d the source said, according to the Telegraph.", "description": "Business Insider - Protest leaders dismissed the unverified claims as fearmongering meant to discourage protesters from turning out to protest..
