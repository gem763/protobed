The girl was asked by another classmate who\u2019d she kill in the school, to which the girl responded by pointing her finger gun at four other classmates and then turning it on herself, a person familiar with the situation told The Star.\n\nAn individual who felt threatened used the school\u2019s online anti-bullying app to alert administrators, an Overland Park police spokesperson told NBC News in a statement Friday. School officials conducted an investigation and the girl was arrested by a school resource officer and later released to her mother.\n\nThe girl was charged with criminal threat, a felony offense, and is due in court Tuesday.\n\n\u201cToo often there are reports of violence in schools and inevitably questions about what could or should have been done to prevent the tragedy,\u201d police said, NBC reported. \u201cThreats in schools are taken very seriously and treated appropriately.\u201d\n\nJon Cavanaugh, the girl\u2019s grandfather in California, where the girl is now living, told The Star that his granddaughter had no intention of hurting anyone.\n\n\u201cI think that this is something that probably could have been handled in the principal\u2019s office and got completely out of hand,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was just mouthing off.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
