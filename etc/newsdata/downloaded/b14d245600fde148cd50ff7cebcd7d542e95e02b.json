More of the recipients have also been women.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the decolonization of Africa, the Vietnam War and the fear of an atomic war made the Nobel Committee more focused on conflicts outside Europe,\u201d said Oivind Stenersen, who co-authored a book about the Nobel Peace Prize, in an interview in 2015.\n\nWhile Ethiopia\u2019s Abiy is expanding the laureates\u2019 geographical diversity, he still fits at least two pre-1970s characteristics: He is a political leader, rather than an underdog, and he is a man.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUntil the 1970s, the Norway-based peace prize committee had focused on political leaders, but it began including more dissidents and lesser-known figures in the second half of the 20th century. For instance, no Russian won the Nobel Peace Prize between 1901 and 1974. But in 1975, the prize was awarded to Soviet nuclear physicist Andrei Sakharov.\n\nSakharov, the mastermind behind Soviet thermonuclear weapons, received the honor \u201cfor his opposition to the abuse of power and his work for human rights,\u201d according to the committee\u2019s official website. Soviet leaders viewed the committee\u2019s choice as offensive and prohibited Sakharov from traveling to Norway to accept his award. But the decision reflected the growing shift within the Norway-based committee that continued in the following decades.\n\nThe dogged defense of democracy and liberties by activists and opposition politicians took a more prominent role in the following decades, for instance with the 2003 decision to award the prize to Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThree influential women from Africa and the Middle East received the 2011 award: Liberia\u2019s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first elected female president in post-colonial Africa; peace activist Leymah Gbowee, also from Liberia; and Tawakkol Karman, a leading Yemeni activist.\n\nMalala Yousafzai, who has advocated for girls\u2019 right to an education in Pakistan and beyond, became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2014, when she was 17.\n\nDespite expanded diversity, not all of the committee\u2019s choices have been uncontroversial. In fact, the prize has long been among the world\u2019s most politically polarizing honors.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama received the prize for his efforts \u201cto strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\u201d in 2009, his critics and even some supporters thought the honor was premature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe selection of Abiy as the 2019 laureate may be met with some skepticism, too. His supporters have credited him for ushering in an era of hope for greater freedoms in Ethiopia after years of authoritarian rule. Thousands of political prisoners have been released, and the first free elections have been promised for 2020. Abiy has also been applauded for his conciliatory moves toward Eritrea and for ending a 20-year long military dispute with that country.\n\nBut some of Abiy\u2019s reforms have also triggered fears of future tensions. He has yet to implement other promised reforms and is only in the early stages of his term \u2014 a situation reminiscent of Obama\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize win in 2009.\n\nThis story was first published Oct. 8, 2015.
