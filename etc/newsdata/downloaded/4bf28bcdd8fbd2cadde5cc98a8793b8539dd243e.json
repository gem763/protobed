They were all published by India-based developed AppAspect Technologies Pvt. Ltd. ZDNet was the first to report that the apps were removed.\n\nWandera researchers found that the apps contained trojan-clicker malware, meaning that the apps could open links or webpages in the background and click them without the user's knowledge, which can artificially inflate traffic and generate ad revenue for the owner. Known as adware, it isn't necessarily as dangerous as other forms of malware, but it can drain a device's battery life.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that 18 apps were removed for having code that allowed for the artificial click-through of ads, which is a violation of Apple's guidelines. A spokesperson told told ZDNet that Apple had updated its security measures to prevent similar apps from making it into the App Store in the future.\n\nAppAspect Technologies also has apps for the Google Play Store. Because of weaker security protections on Android devices, the malware was able to do more harm on the devices, including gather private information and signing users up for expensive subscriptions, 9to5Mac reported.\n\nTen of the apps removed by Apple were still available in the Google Play Store as of publishing, including Daily Fitness Yoga Poses and Placefinder.\n\nGoogle and AppAspect Technologies did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.", "description": "Many of the apps, which span fitness, productivity, travel, and other categories, are still available in the Google Play Store.", "authors": ["Mary Meisenzahl"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b9e1a3589c8a1fe798b5b59?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
