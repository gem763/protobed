Tonight it's about staying together as a group.\n\n'Tonight is not about me. I'll go away and talk to the people I need to talk to and make my decision from there.'\n\nScotland had won their previous seven showdowns with the Brave Blossoms, racking up their biggest ever score with a 100-8 pummelling back in 2004.\n\nBut the tournament hosts went into the game ranked higher than Gregor Townsend's team and Laidlaw could not argue with their win.\n\nLaidlaw converted twice against Japan as Scotland fell 28-21 to the hosts in Yokohoma\n\nHe said: 'We knew Japan have really improved as a team since four years ago.\n\n'We have to give them credit for the way they have progressed and the way we have performed this evening.\n\n'We gave away two soft tries and we left ourselves with a mountain to climb.\n\n'They didn't catch us off guard, we actually started the game pretty well.\n\n'We got into a lead, we never switched off, but we let Japan into the game.'", "description": "Greig Laidlaw has admitted\u00a0he has a decision to make over whether to prolong his Scotland career.
