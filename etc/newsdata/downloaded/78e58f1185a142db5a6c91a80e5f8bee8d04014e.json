House members didn\u2019t kill the bill, but sent it back to committee for a year of interim study, citing security concerns and, in the words of Rep. John Potucek (R-Derry) the ubiquity, cheapness, and\u2014in his opinion\u2014disposability of new smart phones.\n\n\u201cIn the near future, cellphones are throwaways,\u201d Potucek said, according to New Hampshire Business Review. \u201cEveryone will just get a new one.\u201d\n\nThat is, of course, the problem that right to repair is trying to solve.\n\nThe new iPhone 11 costs between $699 and $1,349. And it can be hard to find one at the moment. Google\u2019s Pixel 4 costs between $799 and $999. Manufacturers seal smartphones to make it difficult to replace the battery and do basic repairs. Often, getting repairs through the company is so expensive that people simply purchase a new phone. Apple\u2019s repair monopoly is so dominant that it\u2019s the center of an investigation by the United States House of Representatives\u2019 Judiciary Committee.\n\nRight to repair advocates aren\u2019t buying Potucek\u2019s reasoning.\n\n\"If you told someone 15 years ago that by 2019 cellphones would cost $1,000 and be 'throwaway' device\u2014and you wouldn't even bother to replace batteries\u2014that very idea would seem completely absurd,\u201d Nathan Proctor, the Director of the Campaign for the Right to Repair at US PIRG, told Motherboard in an email. \u201cWe might be more used to that idea in 2019, but it\u2019s no less absurd. We are in danger of losing the basic ability to fix our stuff outside of manufacturer control, and we need legislators to stand up for their constituents right to repair.\"\n\n\u201cAt our three locations throughout [New Hampshire], we serve tens of thousands of our neighbors and visitors each year,\u201d Chad Johansen, president of NH iPhone Repair, said in an email. \u201cMany of our customers are happy with their devices and would rather spend $100 to fix their current device instead of $1000 for a new one with little to no updates or added features. Now the [manufacturers] such as Apple and Samsung are making it harder for residents of NH to repair the devices they own.\u201d\n\nTwenty states had right-to-repair legislation on the ballot this year. The bills haven\u2019t passed in any states, but the legislative season isn\u2019t over yet. In Massachusetts, the State House held a three-hour long hearing on its Digital Right to Repair Act. Right-to-repair advocates are hopeful the act will pass in Massachusetts, where the legislation is patterned after a similar measure that passed in 2012 which gave independent auto shops the right to repair.\n\nThe right-to-repair movement is at a critical stage. The Federal Trade Commission is studying the issue, and Democratic presidential candidates Elzbath Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for national right-to-repair laws.\n\nRep. John Potucek did not respond to Motherboard\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "A New Hampshire lawmaker suggested that we shouldn't fix the $1,000 devices we buy and instead we will \"just get a new one.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db30b0abcb6b100921864fe/lede/1572015176412-GettyImages-1088424998.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8427xh;0xw,0.0975xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
