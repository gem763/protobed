Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said he\u2019ll announce a multistate probe Monday into anti-competitive behavior by large tech companies, and Bloomberg reported last week that the investigation is targeting Google.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really pleased by this news that so many states are going to stand together and essentially join Missouri in its efforts, now two years old, to investigate Google,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nBesides the coming states\u2019 probe of Google, the company on Friday disclosed a Justice Department investigation, and New York announced it\u2019s leading a multistate probe of Facebook Inc. as the technology giants face intensifying scrutiny and the possibility of vast fines and even break-up demands. Antitrust investigations can be long, sprawling probes that can drag on for years.\n\nHawley said that, during his investigation, Google\u2019s opening gambit was to claim that Missouri\u2019s consumer protection statute didn\u2019t apply to the company because it doesn\u2019t sell anything and consumers don\u2019t pay for the service. (Hawley\u2019s probe spanned both consumer protection and antitrust issues.)\n\nGoogle\u2019s search, email, map and other consumer-facing services are free, but the company uses the vast troves of information it obtains from users to sell advertising all over the world. Alphabet Inc. took in almost $137 billion in revenue last year.\n\nNext Google delayed handing over documents, Hawley said.\n\n\u201cWhen they finally did start producing documents, then predictably they took the other approach and produced, I think it\u2019s safe to say, millions of pages of documents, many of which we thought were dated,\u201d he said.\n\nAt one point in talks over what Google would produce and when, his staff was compelled to write to the company that although they might not have \u201coutright lied to us,\u201d they\u2019d been deliberately misleading and acting in bad faith, Hawley said. He declined to go into greater detail.\n\n\u201cYou give your clients a zealous defense, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Hawley said, adding that Google\u2019s tactics were fairly common among corporate targets and that his own office was typically aggressive. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between doing that and misleading and lying about what you\u2019re going to produce, and trying to shut down an investigation by being totally uncooperative.\u201d\n\nGoogle spokesman Jose Castaneda said the company has \u201calways acted in good faith in answering regulators\u2019 questions promptly, honestly, and thoroughly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny suggestion to the contrary is simply false,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Hawley\u2019s probe formally alleged little about the company, it attracted nationwide media attention just as his challenge to incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill ramped up. Since his election in 2018, Hawley has ridden his broadsides against Big Tech, and some proposals to curb its power, to a position as one of President Donald Trump\u2019s right-hand men on the issue.\n\nGoogle has only become more powerful in the market, Hawley said, which means that its \u201cprivacy violations\u201d are that much more harmful. He said he wouldn\u2019t speculate on what the investigation may produce, but he noted his particular concern about the company\u2019s handling of children\u2019s privacy and tracking of consumers across the web. Hawley said fines need to exceed recent settlements and that breakups and unwinding of mergers \u201cshould definitely be on the table.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 4, Google agreed to pay $170 million to the Federal Trade Commission and New York to settle allegations that it violated children\u2019s privacy laws on its YouTube video-streaming platform.\n\nHawley said the group of states should expect that Google will \u201ccertainly buy armies of lawyers. They will buy armies of lobbyists. They will buy armies of economists. They will try and purchase echo chambers and think-tanks.\u201d\n\nThe size of the coalition, and the big states such as Texas that are involved, though, will limit what Google can do in the long run, Hawley said. \u201cThis is very bad news for Google,\u201d he said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Ben Brody in Washington at btenerellabr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sara Forden at sforden@bloomberg.net, Ros Krasny, Mark Niquette\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Republican Senator Josh Hawley warned state attorneys general expected to announce an antitrust probe of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google on Monday that they should expect formidable defensive tactics, no matter how cooperative the company has promised to be.\u201cThey will probably stall, stonewall,", "authors": ["Ben Brody"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/eEs_lj3kVfGXkInXMDZ.7Q--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/e133abd280882c7ba1b8f083100ac1b7", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
