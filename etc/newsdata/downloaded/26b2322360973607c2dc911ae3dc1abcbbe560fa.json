And if you\u2019re looking for a thoughtful, reasonable, and knowledgeable take on the importance of preserving Americans\u2019 access to so-called \u201cassault weapons,\u201d look no further than this:\n\n.@AmySwearer delivering basic facts about how Americans use firearms to @HouseJudiciary in their hearing on \"assault weapons\" is the dopamine hit I didn't know I needed\u2014but I wasn't expecting the story about her mom. If #2A twitter doesn't know who Amy is yet they should today. pic.twitter.com/Aw3Fl1mFOa \u2014 Lyndsey Fifield (@lyndseyfifield) September 25, 2019\n\nWait for the ending: Conservatives have been struggling for years to answer the left\u2019s question \u201cwhy does anyone NEED an AR-15?\u201d and @AmySwearer not only made it clear and easy to understand\u2014she was KIND to those who don\u2019t get it. No dunking needed. https://t.co/p2663FqLzh \u2014 Lyndsey Fifield (@lyndseyfifield) September 25, 2019\n\nAbsolutely fantastic.\n\nWow! She was great! \u2014 Dolly Davenport (@2bSerious) September 25, 2019\n\nEpic testimony! Epic! \u2014 Mathieu Guillet (@mathieu_guillet) September 25, 2019\n\nEloquent, respectful, and factual (as always). Excellent job, @AmySwearer! \u2014 Steve Culy (@charcware) September 25, 2019\n\nThat was my favorite part. No boomer memes. Just the simple explanation that AR15s are far easy for the avg person to use in normal conditions which translates to easier use in a stressful situation. \u2014 Gregg (@greekkid31) September 25, 2019\n\nThank you Amy of Heritage so eloquently defending our second amendment rights. Only two pro gun witnesses were allowed on the panel. Both of them are women. pic.twitter.com/gp7Dx4WcnN \u2014 Antonia Okafor (@antonia_okafor) September 25, 2019\n\n@AmySwearer fighting for all of us on the hill today. She remains a powerful force with @Heritage and is a very strong ally in our fight on Capitol Hill. Allies on all levels. https://t.co/KGPO7KWvjJ \u2014 Exposing Gun Control (@XposeGunControl) September 25, 2019\n\n@AmySwearer absolutely crushes it in this testimony. Listen and bask in the rays of this awesome rebuke https://t.co/vFc8AUrf2K \u2014 John \u201cThe Saint\u201d Dillinger (@Dillingersays) September 25, 2019\n\nThis is the best \"ban assault weapons\" rebuttal I've ever seen. Well done. Someone show this to Beto. https://t.co/yNsUM85vqi \u2014 Cody (@Cody_from_Iowa) September 25, 2019\n\nHOLY COW!!! Amy, this is the first Ive ever heard of you, thank Lyndsey for the video. Amy, you absolutely crushed it. Thank you for being a great voice for #2A \u2014 Gregg (@greekkid31) September 25, 2019\n\nWe\u2019ll leave you with this:", "description": "amy swearer", "authors": ["Sarah D", "Posted At Pm On September", "Sarah D."], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/amy-swearer_from-video.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
