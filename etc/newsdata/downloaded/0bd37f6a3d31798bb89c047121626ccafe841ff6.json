However, Radio Free Asia published a very similar report on Oct. 21.\n\n\u201cThis is the best time for China to invest in North Korea,\u201d the CBC report quoted a North Korean government official in Shenyang as saying.\n\nAs 2019 marked the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the official said, it would be \u201ceasier to negotiate with the Chinese authorities\u201d at the current time.\n\nHowever, one Chinese rare earth industry source said such an agreement was \u201cwishful thinking\u201d on behalf of North Korea and queried the real level of Chinese interest in the project.\n\n\u201cInvesting in North Korea is not safe. Its international reputation is poor and many companies will not necessarily be interested,\u201d said the source, who declined to be identified.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the scheme would comply with UN sanctions. [tinyurl.com/yyb26s8t]\n\nIn response to Pyongyang\u2019s ballistic missile tests, the UN in 2016 imposed sanctions that prohibit North Korea from supplying, directly or indirectly, \u201cgold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals\u201d and said all states should bar their nationals from procuring such materials.\n\nThe North Korean embassy in Beijing could not immediately be reached for comment, while the North Korean consulate in Shenyang, in northeast China, declined to comment.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.", "description": "North Korea plans to grant China access to a rare earth mine in exchange for investment in solar energy that could ease chronic power shortages in the impoverished country, according to an article posted on an industry association website on Thursday.", "authors": ["Tom Daly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
