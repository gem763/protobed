Aaron, the Supreme Court for the first time asserts the myth of judicial supremacy. The case concerns an application by Little Rock, Arkansas, school authorities to suspend for 2-1/2 years the operation of the school board\u2019s court-approved desegregation program. After stating that \u201c[w]hat has been said, in light of the facts developed, is enough to dispose of this case\u201d (by denying the school board\u2019s application), the Supreme Court nonetheless proceeds to purport to \u201crecall some basic constitutional propositions which are settled doctrine.\u201d Among these supposedly basic propositions are the false assertions that the Court\u2019s 1803 ruling in Marbury v. Madison \u201cdeclared the basic principle that the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution\u201d and that \u201cthat principle has ever since been respected by this Court and the Country as a permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system.\u201d\n\nProperly understood, Marbury stands at most for the limited proposition that the courts, in exercising their judicial function, may review the constitutionality of statutes that they are asked to apply. As leading liberal scholar Laurence Tribe has acknowledged, Marbury in no way establishes that the federal judiciary in general\u2014or the Supreme Court in particular\u2014is supreme over the President and Congress in determining what the Constitution means: \u201cpresidents have never taken so wholly juricentric \u2026 a view of the constitutional universe\u2014a view that certainly isn\u2019t implied by the power of judicial review as recognized in Marbury v. Madison.\u201d\n\nContrast Cooper\u2019s brazen dictum with these words from Abraham Lincoln\u2019s First Inaugural Address:\n\n\u201c[T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, . . . the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\u201d", "description": "1958\u2014In a joint opinion of all nine justices in Cooper v.
