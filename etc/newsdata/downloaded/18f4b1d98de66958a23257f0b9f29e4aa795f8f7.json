Temporary workers cost the company an average of $15 per hour compared to permanent workers doing the same jobs. Permanent positions start at $17 an hour and progress from there, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"The temporary people, making them permanent, that's a cause that's near and dear to me because I did it for eight years,\" Yakim said. \"Nobody at my local level, or even nationally, stood up.\"\n\nYakim raised a family while working at GM, even though he was a \"weekend parent\" for several years: employed in Lordstown, Ohio, while his wife and teenage son stayed behind in Maryland. He's seen GM from every angle and can talk at length about \"Aunt Mary\" (GM CEO Mary Barra) and the company's \"hat in hand\" request for a bailout in 2008.\n\nGM employee Mike Yakim on the picket line outside of the the Lansing Delta Township plant.

I know what it's like to be laid off on Thanksgiving.\"\n\nGM counters that employing temporary workers is good for permanent employees, enabling them to take time off. It also gives the company flexibility to scale up production for new models and combat employee absenteeism.\n\nThe company relies on a small cadre of temporary workers, about 7% of its U.S. workforce. Many foreign auto companies with assembly plants in the U.S. rely on more than double that number.\n\nGM employee Mike Yakim on the picket line in Lordstown, Ohio. Courtesy of Yakim\n\nStill, temporary workers' situation is a sticking point in the negotiations between GM and the UAW, which does represent temps in addition to permanent hires.\n\nYakim said improving temps' paths to permanent positions as doing the right thing since the company enjoys a healthy profit.\n\n\"[Temps] don't get the same benefits. They don't have the same retirement plan. They make, in some cases, half the wage I make,\" he said, adding that temp workers have to make ends meet in areas where home prices, lawyers' fees and even restaurant meals reflect what permanent employees like him can afford.\n\nYakim's experience on strike duty has been a little bit different from that of his coworkers: he picketed on Monday at his current plant, Lansing Delta Township. He drove to Lordstown to picket on Wednesday after the local union put out the call for more people to demonstrate outside of the recently shuttered plant.\n\nWhat does Yakim want from GM? He wants \"specifics,\" he said, not just numbers. To him, GM's promise to invest $7 billion GM in the U.S. is not good enough \u2014 he wants specific deadlines and places for the money.\n\nIn fact, there are doubts that all of that money will go to plants where employees make the full UAW wage of $30 an hour, according to a report from the Associated Press.\n\nPicketing union members stand-off with a semi-truck attempting to enter the GM Davison Road Processing Center.

He's no stranger to being on strike: Yakim participated in a local strike in Baltimore in 1991 as well as the two-day nationwide 2007 strike before the auto industry bailout.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"We as a union gave concessions, did our part and said when you get back on your feet we\u2019ll discuss it. Everybody's going to benefit. ... Now [GM] spits in the face of the American taxpayer. They spit in the face of the men and women who have made them these billions of dollars,\" Yakim said.\n\nMeanwhile, the fallout from the UAW strike at GM isn't limited to the carmaker and its employees. The disruption on assembly lines has created a supply-chain backlog, forcing vendors to lay off their own laborers as work dries up.", "description": "Mike Yakim plans on retiring at GM\u00a0and said he wants the UAW to hold out in negotiations\u00a0so that more GM workers get that chance, too.", "authors": ["Evie Fordham"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/mike-yakim.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
