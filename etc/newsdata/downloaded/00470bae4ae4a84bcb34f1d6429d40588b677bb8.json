That is not something that organization does. That is not something that is in full force there. It\u2019s not even in half force.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say they have dozens of great journalists,\u201d Mr. Stelter added.\n\nMr. Zucker fired back, \u201cYou repeat that line a lot and I think it\u2019s one of the mistakes you make in your journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there a handful of really good journalists in that organization? Sure,\u201d the network president continued. \u201cIs there one or two really good anchors in that organization? Sure. But that doesn\u2019t make it a news organization, and it doesn\u2019t make it a journalistic enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d Mr. Stelter asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s akin to state-run TV. I think it\u2019s morphed into conspiracy TV,\u201d Mr. Zucker responded. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a place where somebody like Shep Smith could work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a journalistic organization,\u201d he said, adding that there\u2019s no difference between opinion programming and news programming at Fox News.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing a disservice to the country,\u201d he said, accusing the Murdochs of being \u201cresponsible for a lot of the problems in this country by having instituted a tremendous amount of conspiracies in this country. That\u2019s why I think the way you and others characterize that organization as having a news side and an opinion side is completely erroneous.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
