But Facebook has refused to remove the ad.\n\nIn letters, statements and its official policies, Facebook has emphasized that it believes politicians should be exempt from many of its rules on speech.\n\nFacebook runs a third-party fact-checking program, which adds disclaimers to posts that can be proven false, but it now says that politicians\u2019 posts and advertisements will not go through that system.\n\nWhen Biden pressed Facebook last week over its decision to run the Trump campaign advertisement, Facebook\u2019s public policy director of global elections, Katie Harbath, replied, \u201cWhen a politician speaks or makes an ad, we do not send it to third-party fact-checkers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese policies apply to organic and paid content from politicians \u2014 including the ad by President Trump that you reference in your letter,\u201d she wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Hill.\n\nThat led Warren \u2014 already one of the company\u2019s most prominent critics \u2014 to challenge the company on its own turf.\n\nFor Warren the move could pay political dividends.\n\nDemocrats and prominent tech critics have clamored to force Facebook\u2019s hand, claiming the company enables \u2014 and profits off of \u2014 political disinformation when it does not take action against high-profile instances of falsehoods in advertisements. And Facebook has faced heat across the political spectrum, including from conservatives who allege that social media companies are biased against them.\n\nBut the company has held tightly to its position, even doubling down in a tweet at Warren on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cBroadcast stations across the country have aired this ad nearly 1,000 times, as required by law,\u201d Facebook\u2019s public relations Twitter account tweeted to Warren, referring to the Trump advertisement she has been criticizing. \u201cFCC [Federal Communications Commission] doesn\u2019t want broadcast companies censoring candidates\u2019 speech. We agree it\u2019s better to let voters\u2014not companies\u2014decide.\u201d\n\nThe tweet drew Facebook deeper into the contentious debate over its role in handling political speech, reinvigorating long-standing questions over whether Facebook should be subject to regulations similar to those imposed on public radio and television stations.\n\nThe FCC has strong oversight of broadcast television, issuing licenses that allow specific stations to operate and ensuring they abide by the thorny set of regulations around issues including hoaxes, profane content and political broadcasting.\n\nUnder federal law, broadcasters are not allowed to pick and choose which advertisements to run.\n\nCNN was allowed to decline the advertisement because cable networks are not subject to the same rules.\n\nFacebook\u2019s advertising system also is not subject to any of those regulations. The company has typically resisted any efforts to bring the platform under that level of government scrutiny.\n\nDamon McCoy, a researcher who focuses on Facebook\u2019s political ads archive, noted that Facebook clearly could have followed CNN\u2019s lead.\n\n\u201cIt feels like Facebook basically abdicating responsibility for messages that they\u2019re spreading on their platform,\u201d McCoy told The Hill. \u201cThey\u2019ve accepted payment to deliver to very precise, customized audiences.\u201d\n\nIn her letter to Biden\u2019s campaign, Facebook\u2019s Harbath argued that political speech is the most \u201cscrutinized\u201d speech there is. But McCoy said political speech for hypertargeted online audiences fails to get the same scrutiny.\n\nThe Trump campaign paid thousands of dollars to run the \u201cCorruption\u201d spot, a small fraction of the $587,625 it spent on ads between Oct. 4 and 10 and the over $20 million it has spent since May 2018.\n\nTwitter and YouTube have also received thousands of dollars to run the controversial ad on their platforms. A Twitter spokesperson said the ad does not violate its own policies.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to questions about whether she will be reaching out to those companies as well.\n\nWarren has criticized the tech industry at large, but her most intense public fights have been with Facebook. She has called for the company to be broken up, condemning its market power and acquisitions of smaller companies. In leaked audio released two weeks ago, Zuckerberg called Warren\u2019s threats \u201cexistential.\u201d\n\nThat dynamic is likely to intensify the latest clash between the two.\n\n\u201cI think Facebook is prepared to deal with almost any kind of regulation they can roll with except for the idea of being broken up on antitrust grounds, and she\u2019s the main spokesperson for that idea,\u201d said Barrett, of NYU.\n\n\u201cI think that helps explain why there\u2019s an extra dimension to the edge that Facebook has in its reaction to her.\u201d\n\nMax Greenwood contributed.", "description": "Sen.
