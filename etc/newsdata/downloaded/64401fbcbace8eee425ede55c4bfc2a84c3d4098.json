But the political dramas since then underscore the uphill battle facing negotiators, especially given Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s precarious hold on power.\n\nAmong the low-probability but high-impact risks cited by investment banks and investors: Europe tipped into recession, a Scandinavian currency sell-off and a rout of emerging markets.\n\n\u201cA Halloween horror show could catch markets by surprise,\u201d said Mark Dowding, the chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management in London. \u201cA no-deal outcome would be highly disruptive and likely to have market impact which would potentially extend beyond Europe.\u201d\n\nLike most asset managers interviewed for this article, Dowding sees a no-deal exit by the end of this month as highly unlikely. After the two sides agreed on Friday to begin a more detailed phase of talks, betting odds of a no-deal scenario playing out at all this year dropped below 15%.\n\nYet Brexit has already been spurring a quiet kind of global contagion. Real-money foreign investors keep snubbing European stocks thanks in part to political risk in the region, including dramas emanating from the U.K.\n\n\u201cThe rule of thumb that we have followed as global investors in the last three years has generally played out,\u201d said Alessio de Longis, a New York-based multi-asset fund manager at Invesco. \u201cThe further you are away from Europe and U.K in terms of assets, the less the impact.\u201d\n\nThe tentacles of U.K. markets are long: $2 trillion of its public and private debt was held overseas in 2018, according to data from Nomura International Plc. Nearly one-third of U.K. gilts are in the hands of non-domestic investors. And there\u2019s more than $2.3 trillion of foreign claims on U.K. banks.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include the potential disruption in Britain\u2019s $3.7 trillion a day interest-rate derivative market, nearly half of which is denominated in euros. While the clearing side has been ring-fenced, and many banks have contingency plans in place, it\u2019s hard to completely rule out unintended consequences in complex markets.\n\n\u201cBoth sides can prepare as much as they can, but with these things, it\u2019s the unexpected that turns a bad situation into something worse,\u201d said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura in London. \u201cDay One of Brexit won\u2019t necessarily have the worst-case scenarios played out. But over days and weeks, the impact starts to become very visible.\u201d\n\nIf Britain does crash out, the first-order effect would be on the pound. Some banks, including Morgan Stanley, estimate the British currency could fall by around a fifth to reach parity with the dollar under a hard Brexit. Sterling\u2019s vulnerability has been on full display in recent trading sessions: It surged last week on hopes for a deal, before slumping on Monday as the EU said Boris Johnson\u2019s latest proposals lack detail.\n\nAt Societe Generale SA, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi is worried. Last week at a Bloomberg conference the French bank\u2019s chairman described a hard Brexit as a \u201csystemic event\u201d with the potential to push the global economy into recession.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economists see a 40 basis-point hit to euro-area GDP next year if a no-deal scenario happens, heaping pain onto an already struggling region.\n\nThat would put growth-sensitive currencies such as the Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona at the mercy of a no-deal shock. The euro is also exposed, though demand for the common currency for funding purposes by investors selling riskier assets may help cushion its fall, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cEurope is already flirting with recessions,\u201d said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u201cEven if we get a Brexit deal, there are other risks still looming related to trade wars, the auto sector and lack of policy traction.\u201d\n\nShould a European downturn take hold, it would threaten to wake up credit premiums which have long been depressed by monetary stimulus. That would echo the 2016 breakout, when spreads of euro-denominated company bonds tracked sterling peers higher.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Never mind the dwindling no-deal odds and the almost desperate political optimism of recent days: For investors who remember the vortex that sucked in markets from Tokyo to Toronto three years ago, a hard Brexit remains a tail risk which is simply too big to ignore.The hope is still that", "authors": ["Anchalee Worrachate", "Justina Lee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qAtGrkspspewrIczehiAoQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/f5817cdd722d71280a8bc7ab8578e3a8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
