Georgia Stanway\u2019s 10th-minute stunner was undone first by Frida Maanum\u2019s header from a corner and then a Caroline Graham Hansen mazy run and strike into the roof of the net, leaving the England captain, Steph Houghton, on the ground on her way.\n\nNeville\u2019s reference to humility came after questions about the criticism he has faced. He went on: \u201cI have bad days most days, everybody does. I was just saying I love this job, that when I look down at my shirt and see I\u2019m senior women\u2019s manager, with the three lions on my chest, really, I should never have a bad day, because every day I\u2019m proud.\u201d\n\nNorway 2-1 England: women's international friendly \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nBeforehand, Neville had said this game would be as far from a friendly as a friendly can be. \u201cTwo, three games ago we were in a quarter-final of a World Cup, Norway probably think they were unlucky, they want it. It\u2019s in their home country. They\u2019ve got their biggest crowd,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Fran Kirby absent through injury, Stanway was handed another start in the No 10 role and she did not disappoint. \u201cIt was a top performance,\u201d said Neville. \u201cShe\u2019s now ready to play in those games. She\u2019s getting better every single time we see her. She\u2019s hungry. She\u2019s the type of character I want in the squad. I think she\u2019s got a massive future in the number 10 space.\u201d\n\nAfter the 3-3 draw with Belgium, Stanway was asked about whether she was enjoying being given Kirby\u2019s role. \u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cJust getting in the pockets and getting shots off, you\u2019ve got the freedom to do what you want, to attack and defend and I really enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nQuick guide England to host Brazil at Riverside Show Hide The FA has announced that England\u2019s first home game since their fourth-place finish at the World Cup will be at Middlesbrough\u2019s Riverside Stadium against Brazil, on Saturday 5 October.\n\nPhil Neville said: \u201cIt is great to be able to have secured this fixture against such opposition. I know a lot of work has gone into making it happen. \u201cBrazil will provide a different test to the other games we have lined up over the coming months, and it is always a special occasion when our two countries meet. \u201cI am also delighted that we will be playing in the north-east, a real footballing hotbed that has produced so many of our players over the years.\u201d A game against Germany at Wembley has already been announced for Saturday 9 November, with 60,000 tickets sold so far.

The pass \u201cpleasantly surprised her\u201d, she said. \u201cUsually I\u2019d shoot. The girls will give me stick and say I had my David Silva head on.\u201d\n\nIn Bergen, with the tree and house-lined mountains peering over the somewhat idyllic and unassuming stadium, Stanway chose to shoot. And what a shot. The Manchester City forward picked up a square ball on the edge of the penalty area and lashed a first-time effort in off the underside of the bar. She looked bemused, possibly again pleasantly surprising herself.\n\n\u201cYeah I was [surprised again],\u201d she said afterwards. \u201cIf I can be 20% of the player that Fran is then I\u2019ll be happy.\u201d\n\nNeville had said Lucy Bronze\u2019s powerful strike against Norway at the World Cup was the \u201cmoment that it took for Lucy to win European player of the year. That goal was the turning point, the one that set her apart from everything else.\u201d If that was the moment to lift Bronze firmly into the elite, in Bergen surely we had seen the goal that would thrust Stanway firmly into first-team reckoning.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Caroline Hansen (No 10) celebrates after scoring the winner for Norway late in the game.

She\u2019s a really good kid.\u201d\n\nEngland had been cruising before that but after the goal momentum switched. It took until the 53rd minute for the hosts to find the reply, though. A wonderful low fingertip save by Carly Telford from Amalie Eikeland was undone from the resulting corner. Swung in, it was met by Maanum in the middle and headed cleanly over the Chelsea keeper from close range. It was another goal conceded from a set piece to add to discontent about the team\u2019s inability to deal with dead balls.\n\n\u201cIt was one corner that we defend badly and we\u2019re getting punished for that one corner so it looks like there\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Neville. \u201cTo concede a goal when we\u2019re in control of the game is not acceptable. We\u2019ve just got to be better at it.\u201d\n\nWhere England relaxed after scoring, Norway upped the ante after their equaliser.\n\n\u201cWe have periods of control,\u2019 reflected Neville. \u201cIt\u2019s just concentration, doing it for 90 minutes, basic things, basic passing. I never will have a go at them for trying to do the right thing. But when you try and do that it can stop the rhythm, it stops your ability to get confidence from the game. That\u2019s what happened.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve come from the unbelievable high of the summer, now they\u2019re back down on earth and it takes time to get back up.\u201d\n\nThere was time for a moment of celebration near the end, with the goalkeeper Ingrid Hjelmseth substituted off to a standing ovation on her final appearance, aged 39, for the national team.\n\nThe festivities resumed moments later, when Hansen jigged her way into the box, wrong-footed Houghton, and blasted high over substitute goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck from an acute angle to give the hosts a win and a little revenge.\n\nNikita Parris rescues draw after England throw away two-goal lead over Belgium Read more\n\nNorthern Ireland deny Wales in stoppage time\n\nAshley Hutton\u2019s injury-time header gave Northern Ireland a draw to dent Wales\u2019 Women\u2019s Euro 2021 qualifying hopes.

Marissa Callaghan then struck the crossbar before a mistake by goalkeeper Laura O\u2019Sullivan allowed Hutton to head home.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a loss and it was a bit of a shock the way we\u2019ve been in training,\u201d the Wales manager, Jayne Ludlow said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come away from this one feeling like we\u2019ve let ourselves down. We haven\u2019t performed well in a lot of areas, and you could see the result was coming. We know we\u2019re a work in progress, but we have made it harder for ourselves.\u201d", "description": "Phil Neville said: \u2018Humility is one of our biggest values\u2019 after questions about perceived arrogance after Norway came from behind to beat England 2-1", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4659f086ca8cc21094f51edd34e90e6622262649/0_276_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a598a557bd6ecad8be9c24eab7b993ff"}
