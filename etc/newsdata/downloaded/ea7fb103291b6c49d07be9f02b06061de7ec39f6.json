[UN GLOBAL COMPACT NETWORK KOREA]\n\nThe United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Network Korea held the Korea Leaders Summit 2019 on Thursday, encouraging local companies to more actively pursue sustainable development and jointly tackle social issues like climate change and gender equality.The Korean branch of the corporate sustainability campaign involving some 14,000 companies and institutions has been holding the summit every two years since 2011 to help companies pursue the sustainable development goals (SDGs) set by the UN in 2015. The UN goals include fighting poverty, hunger and climate change and achieving gender equality.\u201cThe world is facing multiple challenges including climate change and corruption,\u201d said Ban Ki-moon, honorary chairman of the UNGC Network Korea, in a keynote speech during the summit. \u201cTo tackle those problems and achieve sustainable social and economic development, everyone, including our companies, needs to take responsibility.\u201dBan specially emphasized the need to fight climate change and openly criticized U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced that the United States will withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change.\u201cI\u2019ve been saying this from before [\u2026] that Trump\u2019s action is politically short-sighted, economically irresponsible, and scientifically wrong,\u201d Ban said. \u201cHe will be standing on the wrong side of history.\u201dBan added that he believes the United States will come back in the future to once again show global leadership.While pursuing SDGs used to be thought of as a corporate responsibility activity to make a company look good, a survey by the UNGC Network Korea unveiled Thursday shows that the perception is shifting and firms are starting to see SDGs as a serious way to be more competitive.Based on a survey of the top 100-listed companies on the Kospi, 29 percent of respondents said SDGs are pursued by their companies\u2019 strategy planning team and 3.6 percent by the investor relations team.\u201cUnlike in the past, more companies are pursuing SDGs through teams other than corporate social responsibility teams, like strategy planning, which shows they are trying to incorporate SDGs into their business strategies,\u201d a spokesperson from UNGC Network Korea said.When asked whether they think pursuing SDGs is a must for companies, 26.3 percent replied with a strong yes, while 55.3 percent answered yes.During this year\u2019s forum, UNGC Network Korea launched a local \u201clead group\u201d for the first time and awarded 10 companies and institutions that were selected to be a part of the group for their progress in sustainable business development.President Lee Dong-kurn of UNGC Network Korea said he hopes the lead group will be a good example for other companies to follow suit.Among the 10 members of the lead group, cosmetics maker Amorepacific was selected for introducing a model of sustainable lifestyle through its product lineup and campaigns while KT was selected for using digital technologies to solve social problems.BY KIM JEE-HEE [kim.jeehee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/24220603.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
