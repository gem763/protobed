That exceeded both its own and analysts\u2019 consensus predictions\u2014 butt posted an adjusted net loss of US$0.29 per share, lower than the US$0.11 in earnings per share analysts expected. The stock opened down more than five per cent on Tuesday.(The Logic, Barron\u2019s)\n\nTalking point: Shopify\u2019s customer base is concentrated in four countries; at the end of 2018, 77 per cent of its 820,000 merchants were located in the U.S., U.K., Canada or Australia. But the firm said Tuesday its international expansion efforts are paying off. An increasing share of its new storefronts are coming from outside its core markets, and are growing faster than their peers in those core markets, said COO Harley Finkelstein and CFO Amy Shapero on the company\u2019s earnings call. Shopify is better placed to make money from that expansion as it launches add-ons like its lucrative payments service in new markets like Italy. It plans to push more merchants to sign up by spending the final third of its $30-million brand advertising budget by the end of the year; last quarter, it rolled out the campaign in France and Germany.", "description": "", "authors": ["Murad Hemmadi"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
