But it doesn\u2019t change too much day to day.\u201d\n\nReece Hodge and Rey Lee-Lo have both received bans after they were cited for high tackles against Fiji and Russia respectively.\n\nWorld Rugby unveiled a new official framework for deciding the level of sanction for a high tackle earlier in the year, aiming to clarify the officials\u2019 process when making a decision.\n\nBut until Quill\u2019s off-ball, after-the-whistle, no-arms shoulder into the head of Farrell, there had not been a red card at the tournament \u2013 despite a number of incidents seemingly fulfilling the criteria for a sending off.\n\nThe news of Francis\u2019 citing came as no surprise, and Eddie Jones is prepared to accept the outcome of his hearing, which will be held in Tokyo at some point in the next few days.\n\n\u201cWe never discuss that area, we leave it to the judiciary or the citing commission,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll take whatever is handed out.\u201d\n\nBoth Ley-Lo and Hodge were given bans of three matches, with their punishments reduced from a six-game entry point due to their clean disciplinary records and good conduct.\n\nSir Clive Woodward, who guided England to World Cup victory in 2003, has criticised the ban given to Hodge, but feels differently about Quill\u2019s tackle of Farrell, and those of Lee-Lo and team mate Motu Matu\u2019u against Russia.\n\nWoodward has suggested these are the tackles that World Rugby should be looking to eradicate.\n\n\u201cThe ugly assault on Owen Farrell by John Quill late in the second half is why we have red cards and the deliberate, targeted high shots by the Samoans Ray Ley Lo and Motu Matu\u2019u against Russia are why we dismiss the disgraced players from the field of play and ban them,\u201d he wrote in his column for the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cThey are the deliberate, callous, illegal challenges that the game must eradicate and must always be punished with an automatic red and a ban so they see the error of their ways.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0back Elliot Daly has claimed that while World Rugby\u2019s focus on high tackles is good for player safety, it hasn\u2019t the England players\u2019 approach to tackling.
