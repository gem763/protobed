Beatles members apologise in interview as they face death penalty in US", "language": "en", "text": "El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey said they regret the death of David Haines (Picture: AP/PA)\n\nThe two remaining British members of an ISIS gang known as \u2018The Beatles\u2019 have said they are sorry for the beheading of an aid worker in 2014.\n\nIt comes as El Shafee Elsheikh, 31, nicknamed Jihadi George, and Alexanda Kotey, 35, known as Jihadi Ringo, await a trial in the US which could end with the death penalty.\n\nWhen asked where the body of David Haines was left and to apologise for his murder, Elsheikh told ITV he does not know where in Syria he was executed.\n\nHe and Kotey gave an interviews while they were being held by Kurdish forces in Syria, a week before they were taken into custody by America as they abruptly withdrew their troops.\n\nElsheikh did confess to having \u2018an interaction\u2019 with Haines by helping to move him and other prisoners into a van.\n\nThe pair have denied being there when Haines was beheaded (Picture: Syrian Democratic Forces/AFP)\n\nHe said: \u2018I have no problem apologising for that\u2019, but denied responsibility for the imprisonment or capture of Haines, who was working at a refugee camp in 2013.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn another interview Kotey also apologised, despite refusing to say anything at first and claiming he already said sorry in unbroadcast footage.\n\nReferring to Haine\u2019s daughter Bethany, he said: \u2018I regret, and I\u2019m sad for her that that was the fate of her father.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s not something that I would have wished for.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not something that I\u2019m in agreement with and if there is anything that I have done which may have caused some kind of distress to her or her father while he was in detention then I apologise for that.\u2019\n\nThey were interviewed by ITV before US forces whisked them away from the custody of Kurdish forces (Picture: AP)\n\nHaines\u2019 wife, Dragana, told MailOnline: \u2018I can\u2019t possibly have an opinion until the right and proper thing is done: That his remains are brought home to his family.\n\n\u2018His wife and daughter have unending lack of closure or focus and a need to respect his final resting place here.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure anyone would understand that need.\u2019\n\nBethany Haines said it was \u2018okay\u2019 if the pair continued to deny wrongdoing but said she is \u2018not letting this go\u2019 and will continue fighting to find out the truth.\n\nMohammed Emwazi, nicknamed Jihadi John, was killed in a drone strike in 2015, while Aine David, known as Jihadi Paul, was sentenced to seven years in prison in Turkey.\n\nThe death squad\u2019s nickname was coined over its members British accents.\n\nElsheikh and Kotey were taken from their prison in northern Syria not long after the interview, as thousands of Turkish troops launched a military offensive.\n\nITV News Security Editor Rohit Kachroo speaking to El Shafee Elsheikh (Picture: PA)\n\nThe pair, who have been stripped of their British citizenship, were reportedly taken to a US Air Force base in Iraq so they could not take advantage of the chaos and escape.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUS forces have been securing \u2018high-value detainees\u2019 and were expected to hand over 50 ISIS militants last night to authorities in Iraq, where many could face trials as short as 10 minutes before being hanged.\n\nBut Kotey, from London, and Elsheikh, from Sudan, who are accused of involvement in 20 beheading, are expected to be transferred to Virginia where major terror trials are held.\n\nAmong their other alleged victims are British aid worker Alan Henning and American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.\n\nBut Elsheikh\u2019s mother has challenged the British Government\u2019s decision to revoke the pair of their citizenship and to not prosecute them in the UK.\n\nMaha Elgizouli, who also demanded the Government stop sharing evidence with US prosecutors until guarantees are given they wont be executed.\n\nDavid Haines and his daughter Bethany, who says she will still fight to find out where her dad\u2019s body is (Picture: Facebook)\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service says there is \u2018insufficient evidence\u2019 to prosecute them in the UK.\n\nA decision is expected within weeks and could thwart the extradition to America if judges rule in Ms Elgizouli\u2019s favour.\n\nTrump and other US officials have tried to persuade the UK and other European countries to take back their citizens accused of joining ISIS.\n\nAsked about danger of members of the death cult making a run for it as Turkey attacks, he said: \u2018Well they are going to be escaping to Europe, that\u2019s where they want to go.\n\n\u2018They could have had trials, they could have done whatever they wanted, but as usual, it\u2019s not reciprocal.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
