We\u2019ve got an 18-month-old, so I\u2019m up between 6.45 and 7am with him. I have about 30 seconds to pee and brush my teeth before getting upstairs to his bedroom. Then I\u2019ll saunter to the kitchen to put the kettle on and change a nappy.\n\nBreakfast or brunch? Both. The joy of getting up early is two breakfasts, that\u2019s the key to a good Sunday. \u2018In breakfast\u2019 is small and early, then it\u2019s time for \u2018out breakfast\u2019. Anything with salt beef or smoked salmon and I\u2019m sold.\n\nDo you work? I worked on Sundays for six years; now I don\u2019t, so I can switch off the news. I love the Sunday papers, but I\u2019ll only read the supplements. I don\u2019t do news on a Sunday.\n\nWhat were Sundays like as a kid? Consumed by day trips, usually at English Heritage sites around Manchester, or to Blackpool to see my grandpa. I\u2019m an only child, so I could bring a friend.\n\nSunday extravagance? I love a massage. All week I\u2019m stressed. Someone sorting my back out is a real treat.\n\nHow do you relax? Drinking: early and often is my motto.\n\nSunday secret? I\u2019ve discovered the pleasures of afternoon napping. On Saturdays I still feel a pressure to make the most of the weekend. On a Sunday I feel you have total permission to do what you want.\n\nLast thing you look at on your phone before bed? I\u2019ll read the Politico Sunday Crunch email to catch up on what\u2019s been happening, and read the briefs from my team for the following day. Then I\u2019ll mooch around interior design sites until I fall asleep looking at rugs. I need new rugs, but I never seem to buy them.\n\nPeriod by Emma Barnett is published on 5 September by HarperCollins at \u00a312.99.
