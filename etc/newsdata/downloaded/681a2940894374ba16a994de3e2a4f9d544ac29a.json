Because the attack occurred over a holiday and most computers were shut off, the malware spread to just 4% of the city's more than 3,500 computers.\n\nThat was the first lucky break.\n\nAfter IT personnel discovered the attack the next day, city officials contacted the anonymous hacker through an email address provided and were told to pay the ransom \u2014 one of the largest-ever known demands for such an attack \u2014 in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the city's data.\n\nMitchell said he was initially opposed to talking with the attacker, a position most cybersecurity experts recommend. Experts say paying the ransom can encourage hackers to launch other attacks or repeated strikes against a city that paid up.\n\nBut Mitchell changed his mind, offering the perpetrator $400,000, using insurance proceeds, because that was about how much other cities had paid in similar circumstances to get their files back. The city's insurance policy covers ransom payments, and Mitchell insisted it would not have come out of taxpayers' pockets.\n\n\"I concluded it would be irresponsible to simply dismiss, out of hand, the possibility of obtaining the decryption key,\" he said.\n\nEven if negotiations were unsuccessful, it would \"buy the city time\" to strengthen security ahead of another attack and to figure out whether engineers could restore the data without a decryption key, Mitchell said.\n\nThe plan worked. While officials were talking to the attacker, the city's IT personnel were able to restore a large portion of the data via backup systems.\n\nSince then, city officials have made \"tremendous progress\" in using backup servers to recover or reconstruct the rest of the data, the mayor said. The city is also implementing new security software and new protocols.\n\n\"Cybersecurity experts were able to remind us that every computer network, however hardened, is always just one keyboard click away from allowing malicious code to slip past its defenses,\" Mitchell said at the news conference.\n\nNew Bedford is just the latest municipality to be hit in a string of recent ransomware attacks this year. More than 40 cities and towns have fallen victim to ransomware, including 22 in Texas alone, The New York Times reported. While the government computer systems of Atlanta and Baltimore were infected with these viruses, most of this year's attacks have targeted smaller cities, according to the IT security firm Barracuda.\n\nRansomware often spreads through phishing emails that contain harmful attachments or through drive-by downloading, which is when a user visits a malicious website by accident and software is downloaded without the user's knowledge.\n\nThe question of whether to pay or not to pay has overwhelmed cities hit by ransom viruses, especially towns with smaller budgets. When a similar attack hit Lake City, Fla. \u2014 a town of only 12,000 residents \u2014 officials paid up because their backup servers were compromised. In that case, the ransom was $460,000 and only $10,000 came out of taxpayer funds.\n\n\"I really had no other choice,\" Lake City, Fla., City Manager Joe Helfenberger told Here & Now. \"We were told by the vendors that with this type of attack, nobody had ever successfully decoded this military-level encryption.\"\n\nAs NPR previously reported, a study by the research firm Recorded Future found that only 17% of municipalities affected by ransomware attacks actually paid the perpetrators.", "description": "New Bedford, Mass., was hit by an attack in July.
