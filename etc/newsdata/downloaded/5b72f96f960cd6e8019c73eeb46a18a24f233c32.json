The sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, deserves praise for leading the reorganization. Labor unions and environmental groups have pushed hard for the plan. It has also received support from unlikelier groups, like the Real Estate Board of New York, a powerful lobbying group, and the Partnership for New York City , a business group akin to a chamber of commerce.\n\nThose groups back the plan because they see it for the opportunity that it is: a chance to make the city safer and healthier, a chance to renovate an industry that affects the quality of life of all 8.5 million people who live in New York.\n\n\u201cTrash management and disposal is a huge issue in society, and figuring out a smarter way to do it in a growing city like New York is a business priority,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City . \u201cThis plan is a smart way to handle the issue.\u201d\n\nThe city has been at war with its trash since its founding. \u201cThere are accounts of Peter Stuyvesant being enraged at how sloppy the colonists were, even in the first decades of the 1600s,\u201d said Robin Nagle, a professor at New York University, and the anthropologist-in-residence at the city\u2019s Department of Sanitation.\n\nModern officials have had their own sanitation battles \u2014 some entirely predictable, others not. Until the mid-1990s, when prosecutors stepped in, the mafia exercised significant influence over the industry, increasing costs by up to 40 percent.\n\nThe plan before the Council this week won\u2019t solve all sanitation problems, but it can help.\n\nDaily traffic from private garbage trucks would be reduced by more than half, from more than 28 million miles per year to fewer than 11 million by 2024, when the plan is to be fully in effect, according to city officials.\n\nThe plan would also impose new rules to improve safety, labor practices and customer service.\n\nThere is still more the city can do to improve its own operations. The mayor, for example, promised to get composting underway throughout the city. That way, food waste can be composted instead of ending up in landfills, where it generates methane, a major contributor to climate change.", "description": "And what the City Council is about to do to change that.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30sanitation-2/30sanitation-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
