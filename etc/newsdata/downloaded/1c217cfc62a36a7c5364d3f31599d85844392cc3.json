We were taken back off the bus, and we were told, as well as the passengers, we all had to pay.\n\n\u201cWe feel completely isolated over here, no real communication at all, it\u2019s just a matter of waiting and seeing if we can get this flight home tonight or whether we\u2019ll be here for the night.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t any rooms, there\u2019s nothing put in place for us, it\u2019s just a waiting game.\u201d\n\nAll Thomas Cook flights ceased on Monday morning, leaving passengers and crew dependent upon an airlift organised by the CAA \u2013 code-named \u201cOperation Matterhorn\u201d.\n\nThe repatriation mission aims to get most of the 155,000 Thomas Cook customers abroad back to Britain on the day they were expecting. The CAA is also seeking to help flight crew.\n\nA UK government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand that this is a hugely distressing situation for Thomas Cook passengers, people with holidays booked with Thomas Cook and Thomas Cook staff.\n\n\u201cThe government have deployed teams on the ground to support those affected, and are in contact with local authorities and hotels.\u201d\n\nBetty Knight, 52, who has worked for Thomas Cook as cabin crew for the last 13 years, has been liaising with her colleagues who are currently stranded in Cuba.\n\nShe said that some are getting extremely distressed: \u201cSome of them are young mums, desperate to get home. They have been held to ransom.\u201d\n\nThe cabin crew say they were asked for \u00a33,000 in cash. When the captain offered to pay the bill by credit card, he was refused \u2013 apparently because it was issued by a US bank.\n\nBecause of Washington\u2019s economic embargo against Cuba, American credit cards are difficult to use in Cuba.\n\nThe Independent has also been told that British tourists were \u201cbeing held in the lobby\u201d of another hotel along the coast, the Brisas Guardalavaca.\n\nSherry Bullough said that her parents had been told they must pay for their stay. She told The Independent: \u201cThey are being asked for \u00a31,000 but they haven\u2019t got the money to pay.\n\n\u201cThey have had a meeting but been told that they can\u2019t really do anything. The hotel have turned the wifi off. They aren\u2019t allowing recording of meetings or confrontations. It\u2019s so very upsetting.\u201d\n\nThe British Ambassador to Havana, Antony Stokes, became involved and appears to have successfully negotiated with the Cuban authorities on behalf of the passengers and crew.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cHotels in #Cuba now have authority/instruction to allow customers, and air crew, to depart without paying (on basis of ATOL guarantee).\n\n\u201cVery grateful for patience of all affected in distressing circumstances.\u201d\n\nLate on Tuesday evening, it emerged that crew from French and German airlines had offered to help their British colleagues with emergency accommodation and even offered to help find space on flights to Europe.\n\nCuba is highly dependent on tourism. Under Barack Obama, the US trade embargo was eased, and tens of thousands of Americans visited the island. But Donald Trump has tightened the regulations to rule out mainstream tourism.\n\nBritish tourists started travelling to Cuba in large numbers in 1994, when the first charter flights \u2013 sold by Thomas Cook \u2013 took off from Gatwick to Holguin.\n\nThe island will be hard hit by the collapse of Thomas Cook. The firm was expected to take around 2,000 visitors a week to Cuba during the winter season. There is no prospect of other companies stepping in at short notice to launch replacement flights to the island.", "description": "After the giant holiday company Thomas Cook collapsed, around 60 British holidaymakers and 11 flight crew are said to have been \u201cheld to ransom\u201d in a hotel in eastern Cuba.
