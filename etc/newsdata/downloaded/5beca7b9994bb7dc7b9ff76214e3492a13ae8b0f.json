What is in development at the White House is the emphasis on a strategy \u2014 not personnel.\u201d\n\nEarlier at the news briefing, Graham said he had talked to the White House\u2019s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, adding \u201cI think they\u2019re working on getting a messaging team together.\u201d\n\nGraham pointed to the impeachment defense followed by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, as a model, saying he \u201chad a team that was organized, that had legal minds that could understand what was being said versus the legal proceedings in question, and they were on message every day.\n\n\u201cPresident Clinton defended himself but he never stopped being president,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAnd I think one of the reasons that he survived is that the public may not have liked what the president had done but believed that he was still able to do his job ... I\u2019m hoping that will become the model here.\u201d", "description": "U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Thursday that the White House is working on messaging on the House of Representatives probe into whether President Donald Trump should be impeached, and later tweeted that he meant they are developing a strategy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444628413&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1VW", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
