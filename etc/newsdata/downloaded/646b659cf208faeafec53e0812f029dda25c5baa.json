Her parents have been charged in relation to her death\n\nA New Jersey police officer and his wife have been indicted by a grand jury over the death of their three-month-old baby girl.\n\nBaby Hailey Rose Bannister died in December 2017, six days after being taken to hospital with 'critical injuries'.\n\nAn autopsy later revealed her death was the result of 'blunt impact trauma' to her head.\n\nOn Friday, her parents faced indictments handed down by a Mercer County grand jury.\n\nHer father, Daniel Bannister, 31, was indicted for murder, and his wife, Catherine Bannister, 29, was indicted on a second-degree reckless manslaughter charge.\n\nBoth had previously been charged with child endangerment after her death.\n\nAccording to authorities, the couple are accused of repeatedly abusing their daughter throughout her short life.\n\nEmergency services had found the baby girl unresponsive at her Ewing Township home on December 5, 2017, after Catherine Bannister, a kindergarten teacher, called 911 to report baby Hailey was having trouble breathing.\n\nOn arrival paramedics found the little girl was not breathing; she was in cardiac arrest and had a fractured skull and ribs. She was taken to hospital in a critical condition where she later died, on December 13.\n\nPolice investigators deemed there were suspicious circumstances behind her death.\n\nSubsequently, her father was suspended from his job as a homicide detective pending the investigation into his daughter's death, before being arrested, charged with her murder and jailed in July 2018.\n\nMs Bannister, was charged with second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, but at this month's grand jury was handed the heavier charge of second-degree reckless manslaughter.\n\nDaniel Bannister, 31, (left) has been indicted for murder and his wife Catherine Bannister, 29, indicted for a reckless manslaughter charge\n\nProsecutors allege that the young girl's injuries 'indicated an ongoing pattern of abuse' at the hands of her parents.\n\nA SF Gate report said authorities alleged Ms Bannister had confronted her husband on October 4 about bruising she found around her then one-month-old daughter's mouth.\n\nDays later she was also said to have texted a friend who worked as a pediatric nurse, but asked her not to report it.\n\nThe information, detailed in the couple's charging document, said Ms Bannister had told her husband he was 'abusive' and could not touch their daughter again unless he took a class on early childhood development.\n\nThe document said her friend advised her to leave her husband and offered her a safe place to stay.\n\nThe couple's lawyers have said their clients deny the allegations and maintain they are innocent and that someone else could be responsible for baby Hailey's injuries.\n\nIn the immediate hours after her death a fundraising page was started to help her family cope.\n\nThe organizers, who have since closed the page and have promised to return the donations, shared their sadness at the loss of a little 'hero'.\n\n'We will forever be in awe of her fighting spirit,' it read. 'Please continue to keep Hailey\u2019s family in your thoughts and prayers as they grieve the loss of their beautiful girl.'\n\nIn an update posted on July this year they expressed their 'shock and devastation' at the terrible news.\n\n'Please know that this campaign was made from a place of kindness on behalf of the family prior to details of Hailey\u2019s injuries being released,' they wrote on the now-closed fundraising page.\n\n'We are incredibly shocked and devastated with this terrible news and in no way shape or form want this family to benefit from your generosity.'\n\nIt said while the funds had been used towards baby Hailey's funeral and burial they were working hard to keep all who had donated informed and return their money in due course.", "description": "Baby Hailey Rose Bannister died in December 2017, six days after being taken to hospital in New Jersey with 'critical injuries'.
