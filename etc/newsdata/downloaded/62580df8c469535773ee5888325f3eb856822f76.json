It would be the end of my political project.\u201d Speaking to a packed crowd at the How The Light Gets In philosophy and music festival in London he added that he still regards the prime minister\u2019s promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October as \u201csomewhere between a fairy story and an untruth\u201d.\n\nAsked what he would do if he were proved wrong, he said: \u201cIf he does get a deal through, I would not stand again. I would be the first to apologise. I would get down on bended knees in front of Boris and admit I\u2019d been wrong.\n\n\u201cAt some level what I am going through is the experience of losing my job or being kicked out of a marriage, and that does have an effect on you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is hard to see people you thought were your friends in parliament on television saying that it was right that I got fired.\u201d\n\nJohnson, he believes, will try to continue to lead even if the supreme court rules against the validity of his decision to prorogue parliament. \u201cThe danger is then we would move to a more Trumpian form of politics where he would claim to represent the people against parliament.\u201d\n\nStewart delivered his powerful verdicts on the current political crisis during a heavily oversubscribed public interview at the festival. Speaking to the BBC journalist Emma Barnett, he accused David Cameron of being guilty of \u201can astonishing betrayal of trust\u201d if his recent accounts of his discussions with the Queen on the eve of the EU referendum are correct. Stewart said Cameron was also partly to blame for a general \u201ccollapse of seriousness\u201d in politics and in public life. Admitting he had not yet read Cameron\u2019s new memoir, Stewart said he believed the former prime minister was too fond of political gossip. \u201cI am afraid he likes insider gossip. He thinks it is a good way to charm the crowd.\u201d\n\nAs a former leadership candidate himself, Stewart attacked the character and political strategies of both Cameron and Johnson, fellow old Etonians. It was not right, Stewart argued, for the public to blame advisers such as Dominic Cummings for government strategy. \u201cI take the simple view that the person responsible is the person at the top,\u201d he said.", "description": "The former international development secretary warns of \u2018more Trumpian type politics\u2019", "authors": ["Vanessa Thorpe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0da5a9b897866cf8fc1ab792e5d1b011a91f6a1a/0_68_3224_1934/master/3224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c661e1bd60c3ac45b4b9d7ab771de7b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
