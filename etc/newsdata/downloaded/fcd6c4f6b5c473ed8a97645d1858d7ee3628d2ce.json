However with prices now below year-ago levels, we see potential for earnings-per-share upside in Q4 and early 2020.\u201d\n\nKeyBanc rates Chipotle CMG, +0.71% stock overweight with an $870 price target.\n\nRead: Chipotle\u2019s CEO explains how his company achieved a surprising comeback that has sent its stock rocketing\n\nWith the avocado price problem starting to subside, Wedbush is upbeat about other ingredients on Chipotle\u2019s shopping list.\n\n\u201cWe view the remainder of the supply chain as largely insulated given the relative size of Chipotle\u2019s protein and produce suppliers,\u201d analysts wrote.\n\nWedbush rates Chipotle stock outperform with a $980 price target.\n\nOn Sept. 19, Chipotle introduced carne asada and sales seem to be going better than SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Jake Bartlett thought they would, which could be \u201cdriving check and upside to same-store sales estimates.\u201d\n\nFactSet is guiding for 9.2% same-store sales growth. Chipotle has beaten FactSet\u2019s same-store sales expectations the last three quarters.\n\nMenu innovation is a key part of the strategy to continue Chipotle\u2019s growth and Bartlett says carne asada is well received.\n\n\u201cIn 20 stores across the country, we found employees telling customers that carne asada was selling equal to or much more than steak and, in some cases, almost as much as chicken,\u201d according to the SunTrust note. \u201cWhile somewhat anecdotal and a small sample size, we believe that carne asada may be boosting check by more than our prior estimate of 150 basis points.\u201d\n\nCarne asada is priced 6% above steak and barbacoa and 21% higher than chicken, with chicken the far more popular protein, analysts said.\n\nSunTrust rates Chipotle stock buy with a $900 price target.\n\nChipotle has an average hold stock rating, according to 34 analysts polled by FactSet. Chipotle has an average price target of $800.39.\n\nSee: \u2018Totally bizarre!\u2019 -- nutritionists see red over study playing down the health risks of red meat\n\nHere\u2019s what to watch for in Chipotle\u2019s earnings:\n\nEarnings: FactSet is guiding for earnings per share of $3.18, up from $2.16 last year.\n\nEstimize, which crowdsources estimates from sell-side and buy-side analyst, hedge-fund managers, executives, academics and others, expects per-share earnings of $3.26.\n\nChipotle has beat FactSet earnings expectations the last seven quarters.\n\nSales: FactSet forecasts sales of $1.38 billion, up from $1.23 billion last year.\n\nEstimize is guiding for sales of $1.39 billion.\n\nChipotle has beaten the FactSet sales estimates for the last three quarters.\n\nStock: Chipotle stock is up 9.7% for the last three months, and has rallied 92% over the past year.\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, +0.28% is up nearly 7% for the past 12 months.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Here\u2019s how Beyond Meat can lose the lead in the plant-based meat category to Tyson\n\nOther things to look for:\n\n-Delivery is also giving Chipotle a bump. Stifel expects same-store sales to rise 10% to 11% with delivery available from about 95% of the company\u2019s locations, or about 2,400 restaurants.\n\n\u201cThe company continues to utilize free delivery incentives, sponsored either by DoorDash or itself, building upon its baseline demand following the offer, so we expect it will remain a key promotional tool,\u201d Stifel wrote.\n\nStifel rates Chipotle stock hold with a $755 target price.\n\n-In addition to delivery, analysts think the Chipotle\u2019s loyalty program could grow to be a bigger asset. Chipotle said in September that it had about 6 million Rewards members.\n\n\u201cBeyond 2019, we believe the continuing growth in digital, supported by traction in loyalty, menu innovation, and marketing spend could enable a multiyear streak of mid-to-high single-digit same-store sales growth,\u201d wrote Wedbush.", "description": "Chipotle results should get a boost from its menu and digital initiatives, including delivery.", "authors": ["Tonya Garcia"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR687_chipot_ZG_20190919164907.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
