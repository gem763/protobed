Scientists have attempted to estimate the number of people at risk, but according to a new study, all those numbers have been far too low.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Communications today, indicates that three times more coastal residents worldwide are vulnerable to sea-level rise and flooding than previous estimates suggested.\n\nThe two climate scientists behind the new study, Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, work at the organization Climate Central. They concluded that 110 million people worldwide already live on land that's below the current high-tide line. About 250 million, meanwhile, occupy land below current annual flood levels.\n\nWhat's more, their model shows that a significant number of people live just above today's high-tide line.\n\n\"There is a really huge concentration of population density in the very lowest strips of land, in the lowest places along the coast globally,\" Strauss told Business Insider. \"It turns out within those first couple of meters [above sea-level], there are more than 3 million people per vertical inch.\"\n\nA quarter of a billion people worldwide live just above the high-tide line\n\nMiami king tide flooding More\n\nKevin Loria/Business Insider\n\nIn the 20th century, the average global sea level has already risen 6 inches due to warming waters and melting ice sheets. This has already led to more high-tide flooding (often called king tides or sunny-day floods). This kind of flooding \u2014 unlike that from storm surges during extreme weather events like hurricanes \u2014 can happen any time ocean water surges to higher levels than coastal infrastructure was designed to accommodate.\n\nFor the new study, the researchers looked at data from 135 countries across multiple emissions scenarios and timelines. Typically, international flood-risk assessments use data from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which mapped the elevation of countries around the world from space.\n\nBut, according to Strauss, that data uses the tops of buildings as proxies for elevation, not the actual height of the ground those buildings sit on. So Strauss and Kulp used a new model designed to correct that discrepancy.\n\nThey found that, even under a highly optimistic scenario in which greenhouse-gas emissions peak next year then decrease, 190 million people would occupy land below sea-level by the end of the century. If emissions continue to rise through 2100, that number could reach 630 million people globally. That's nearly double the current US population.\n\nThese numbers are triple the totals scientists would glean by using just the NASA data.\n\n\"We've elucidated that you can't measure flood risk by analyzing the elevation of rooftops \u2014 you have to know the height of the ground beneath your feet,\" Strauss said.\n\nEven more concerning, he added, is the number of people who currently live less than 32 feet (10 meters) above today's high-tide levels: 1 billion. Nearly a quarter of those 1 billion people live less than 3 feet (1 meter) above that line.", "description": "A new study suggests that far more people could experience the consequences of coastal flooding than earlier estimates suggested.", "authors": ["Aylin Woodward"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4eoOVOASTPLDtaIvYrU1bQ--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/09b92fc4fe5c1afd06bdd9bea348f0cd", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
