Parents are so important, i never want to lose mine '. [sic]\n\nElsewhere in the show, a devastated Charlotte reveals: 'It\u2019s absolutely terrifying the idea of not having him around. I rely on him for so much, he\u2019s my buddy, my absolute best friend and has been for years.'\n\nSpeaking about the condition himself, James bravely notes: 'Time is not on my side. The disease I have is very rare, only one in eight million people have it. It\u2019s called AL amyloidosis. The worst scenario is I could only have six months, so I\u2019m in a horrible position.'\n\nDiscussing his treatment, Charlotte elaborates: 'He\u2019s on chemotherapy and to be honest he\u2019ll be on it until he dies. He\u2019s on his third round. He has had breaks because it is tough going but he is a strong as an ox.'\n\n'Absolutely terrifying': AL amyloidosis occurs when a person produces abnormal protein fibres, which in return causes serious damage to organs (pictured with mother Maria)\n\n'It\u2019s just horrendous that he\u2019s got it at this age, he\u2019s still a relatively young man. But he will fight this for as long as he can.\n\n'He\u2019s got it quite advanced in his heart because he wasn\u2019t diagnosed for quite a long time, it\u2019s not great.'\n\nThe former child star has never really known her biological dad, and was brought up by James - who adopted her in 1999.\n\nCharlotte went on to made the heartbreaking realisation: 'If you look at the survival rates, 50% of patients who start chemotherapy die in the first six months. So he is massively fighting for his life right now, basically.'\n\n'In a horrible position': Speaking about the condition, James bravely noted: 'Time is not on my side. The disease I have is very rare, only one in eight million people have it' (pictured in 2000)\n\nNoting that there is no cure and that the chemo will one day stop working, Charlotte proved optimistic, stating: 'He\u2019s outliving what doctors thought was possible'\n\n'I guess essentially everyone is scared of death, but if we can embrace it more as a life process, to see it as the next great adventure, that\u2019s the way I try and deal with it.'\n\nGushing previously about her stepfather James to The Guardian, Charlotte said: ' James is a phenomenal father and my earliest memory of him is seeing him walk towards me to meet my mum when I was sitting on top of a post box.\n\n'Family life was loud, it was noisy, it was vivacious, but they were quite strict. They wouldn't take no messing and they were salt of the earth people, sort of normal but pretty rough.'", "description": "The singer, 33, and her parent, 53 - who suffers from AL amyloidosis - left her fans in 'buckets of tears' s in new Channel 4 documentary, Charlotte Church: My Family and Me, aired on Thursday.", "authors": ["Rianne Addo For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/01/19864646-0-image-a-33_1571359506593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
