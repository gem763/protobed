It's also why way more attention needs to be paid to Ivanka and Kushner, who are both national security threats,\" she said in the post retweeted by Messing.\n\nMessing, a vociferous critic of the president, has received attention for recently calling on The Hollywood Reporter to publish the names of people attending a fundraiser for Trump.\n\nShe also received criticism for praising a sign that called black Trump voters mentally ill -- something for which she later apologized.\n\nMessing, on Tuesday, also retweeted conservative writer David Frum, who blasted national security officials for refusing to call out the president's alleged incompetence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Everybody who works closely with Trump in a national security capacity knows that the president is unfit for his office, but none will tell the public what they say to their intimates,\" Frum said. \"They forgot: they owe their duty to the country to the nation, not to Trump.
