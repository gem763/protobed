What we wanted to do was just play our football, to win the game and that\u2019s what we did. When stuff like that happens you have to try and block it out even though it is so blatant.\n\n\u201cWe just wanted to go out there, play our game and win the game. The manager spoke to us after and said there was help there if needed. It\u2019s just one of those things that happened.", "description": "Fikayo Tomori has confirmed that he and his new England team-mates have been offered expert support to try to ensure there are no lasting effects from the racist abuse they suffered in Bulgaria last week.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Sam Dean", "Ipek Tugcu"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/22/TELEMMGLPICT000213788246-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF9BD_fYQB0teZOF4IslN2WclioocPp7CdIUOTtw1IRI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
