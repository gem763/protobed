Byrne, who is among the six Republicans running in the Senate primary, declined to discuss the nature of the short phone call or get into any specifics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe insisted he would not drop out of the Senate race if Sessions decides to join it.\n\n\u201cJeff and I talked last week,\u201d Byrne, who has known Sessions since 1980, told The Hill on Tuesday. \"I won\u2019t reveal the details of that conversation, but I am not leaving the race. I have qualified, and I am in it to the end no matter who is in or out.\u201d\n\nThe other Republicans in the Senate race are former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, businessman Stanley Adair and Roy Moore Roy Stewart MooreMontgomery, Ala., elects first African American mayor GOP Senate candidate Tommy Tuberville says Trump has 'put a noose' around farmers' necks with trade war Sen.

In 2017, Jones, a Democratic former federal prosecutor, upset the Republican nominee, Moore, who had been facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, including claims of sexually abusing underage teen girls. Moore has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSessions, 72, would be a formidable Senate candidate.\n\nHe has tremendous name ID. He still has $2.5 million in his campaign coffers, not to mention an unmatched fundraising network in the Yellowhammer State. Some GOP strategists in Alabama suggested that if Sessions runs, Byrne donors and supporters could switch their allegiances.\n\n\u201cByrne\u2019s people are all Sessions\u2019s people. And Sessions\u2019s base of support is in Mobile, which is also Byrne\u2019s base of support,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cThis would hurt Bradley the most.\u201d\n\nBut Sessions would have to contend with his complicated relationship with Trump. He resigned as attorney general last November after months of criticism by Trump over his decision to recuse himself from overseeing the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. That probe cast a cloud over the Trump administration for nearly two years.\n\nAccording to a copy of his resignation letter, Sessions agreed to resign at Trump\u2019s request\n\n\u201cI came to work at the Department of Justice every day determined to do my duty and serve my country,\u201d Sessions wrote. \u201cI have done so to the best of my ability, working to support the fundamental legal processes that are the foundation of justice.\u201d\n\nTrump, who made the announcement over Twitter at the time, has continued to publicly berate his former attorney general, whom he replaced with William Barr William Pelham BarrHillicon Valley: FCC chief aims to ban Huawei, ZTE from federal program | DOJ to allow body cameras in joint task forces | Facebook workers push back over political ads Justice Department to allow body cameras on joint task forces Trump blasts Chicago police chief in first visit to city as president MORE.\n\n\u201cYou look at what\u2019s happening over at the Justice Department, now we have a great attorney general. Whereas before that, with Jeff Sessions, it was a disaster. Just a total disaster. He was an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama,\u201d Trump told former adviser Sebastian Gorka in an interview published in The Daily Caller earlier this month.\n\nTrump also went so far as to say he wished Sessions, one of his earliest supporters in the Senate, had \u201cnever endorsed\u201d him during his presidential bid in 2016.\n\n\u201cAnd I put him there because he endorsed me, and he wanted it so badly. And I wish he\u2019d never endorsed me,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe remarks came after Sessions, during a Republican fundraiser in Alabama, said that he still supports Trump, according to Alabama.com.\n\nSessions is facing a tight deadline: Candidates have until Nov. 8 to qualify for the ballot.", "description": "Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions has been making calls to his former colleagues in the Alabama congressional delegation to discuss a Senate run, the strongest indication yet that he could join the GOP primary race for the Senate sea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sessionsjeff_050919gn2_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
