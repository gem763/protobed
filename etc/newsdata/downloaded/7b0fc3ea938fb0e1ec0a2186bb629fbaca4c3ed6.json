The encounters ended when he was transferred to another division.\n\nThe girl had believed she was in a relationship with McGuffog but was said to have tried to block memories of her ordeal due to an attitude of 'respect' towards the police - and did not tell anyone until 2017 when she underwent counselling.\n\nMcGuffog, pictured walking over hot coals, used his job at the club to groom the schoolgirl\n\nMcGuffog, who retired from Greater Manchester Police in 2009 after a 30-year career, has since been working as a coach at Lancashire Cricket Club and has become a grandfather.\n\nIn a statement, the victim, who is a mother now in her 40s, said: 'He has made me hate myself and I can't look at myself in the mirror, I don't have any photographs of myself and the kids because I don't like looking at myself.\n\n'It made me feel disgusting I can't do things normal couples do. I can't even look at a man without a top on - I just see that chest all the time it makes me feel sick.\n\n'I can't even hold a relationship and it's the 'why did you let him' that really still gets to me. It is a constant feature all the time and it is so, so tiring.\n\n'I hated the police after what happened and used to get in fights and took out a lot of anger out on my father.\n\n'There is difficulty with any sexual activity and an inability to hold a relationship because of that my children have grown up without a father present.\n\n'This man used me as if I as a piece of crap. It was only when my daughter was coming up to 15 that triggered me into telling someone.\n\n'I felt such a failure as a parent and everything started to come back to me about when I was 15, I just wanted to die.\n\nMcGuffog (above) had met the 15-year-old girl after applying to work at the club in Manchester\n\n'I think he has messed me up for life. I tried to hang myself. To him it might have been just a bit of fun but to me it has ruined me. I have never really had a future.'\n\nAt Manchester Crown Court, McGuffog, now 60, was convicted of indecent assault and misconduct in a public office after a trial.\n\nThe incidents began in 1989 after MCGuffog applied to be stationed at the club for disadvantaged youngsters in the Ancoats district.\n\nBrian Berlyne, prosecuting, said: 'The centre was the brainchild of the then Chief Constable of Manchester, James Anderton, for the police to take over the running of this centre and engage more with the community for the benefit of the young people living there.\n\n'It was referred to by the children who used it as the 'police club' and was very well attended. It provided excellent facilities for the young people to use, including an indoor football pitch, a gym, pool/snooker tables, and a tuck shop.\n\n'Only an inspector who worked there wore a police uniform whilst the other officers would wear casual clothes such as tracksuits so as to be more approachable to the youngsters.\n\n'The victim enjoyed attending at the centre as it gave her something to do and people to socialise with and she became aware of McGuffog.\n\n'He would chat to her and pay her attention, for which she was flattered. He talked a lot about cricket and how he had completed a climb of Scafell Pike.\n\nMcGuffog (left, in the 80s) was convicted of indecent assault and misconduct in a public office\n\n'He would also run the tuck shop area and would give the victim coffee and crisps for free, telling her not to tell anyone. It was classic grooming behaviour, winning over her trust and affection in this way.'\n\nMcGuffog first forced himself on the girl when he picked her up as she was walking home from the club.\n\nHe took her to the red light district behind Manchester Piccadilly train station where the pair kissed before he made her perform a sex act on him.\n\nThey then had similar liaisons a the same location including one in which they accidentally sounded the horn on the Metro - attracting the attention of muggers who robbed McGuffog of his wallet.\n\nMr Berlyne said: 'At that time she thought very highly of him, perhaps having a bit of a crush on this older man in a position of power. She also was quite na\u00efve and not at all experienced in the ways of relationships.\n\n'But she did not want sex. Even when she told him that she didn't, he still continued. She went along with everything not knowing what to do to stop it, but part of her also believing she was in a relationship with him.\n\n'The victim told no-one about what had happened over the years until she needed counselling in 2017 and suddenly everything came tumbling out. She had kept it inside for so long that she then blamed herself for what had happened.\n\nMcGuffog first forced himself on the girl when he picked her up as she was walking home\n\n'The matter was reported to police not by the victim but by a psychologist she was seeing. The victim was initially fairly reluctant to make a complaint but then decided that this was something she wanted to support.\n\nThe prosecutor added: 'You may wonder why the victim would get in the car with him each time, knowing what was going to happen and not particularly wanting it.\n\n'But this was a very different era - police officers were still respected and obeyed without question by children. But also she was just a child, albeit one who had a crush on him and was flattered by the attention she was being shown.\n\n'It is perhaps easy for us as adults with the benefit of hindsight, experience and strength of character that we would not have got into the car, but not quite so easy for this young, impressionable child from a very different and difficult background.\n\n'Whether or not she appeared to go along with what was being forced upon her, she did not consent and was not of an age or in a position to consent. She went along with what was being done to her so mere acquiescence rather than true consent.'\n\nMcGuffog denied wrongdoing and was described in court as 'an exemplary police officer with commendations for bravery'\n\nMcGuffog denied wrongdoing. His lawyer David Wood said in mitigation: 'He was an exemplary police officer with commendations for bravery.\n\n'Far from a life of hurting young people he had dedicated his life to public service. This is a man who consistently has been the rock upon whom his family has built itself.\n\n'He is someone upon whom his family and friends rely for his kindness, sincerity and affectionate nature.\n\n'The sentence will be a punishment not just to him but to them, there will be a large hole in that family for the foreseeable future.\n\n'He finds himself in prison not just convicted of these offences but as a former police officer. He plainly is a different man now.'\n\nSentencing, Judge Alan Conrad QC told McGuffog: 'You served the police with distinction but there was for many years a dark secret in your background.\n\n'You became close to the victim and using your status and greater sophistication, cultivated and seduced this impressionable, vulnerable young girl.\n\n'It is clear to me that she has suffered from psychological and emotional damage as a result of her experiences with you. It is a terrible fall from grace for you following a distinguished career for the most part dedicated to serving other without blemish.'\n\nMcGuffog was also ordered to sign the Sex Offender Register indefinitely. The youth club closed in 1992.", "description": "Paul McGuffog, now 60, of\u00a0Stretford, Greater Manchester, was 32 when he had a series of sexual encounters with the girl in the 1980s and 90s after taking her to a red light district in his Mini Metro.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19447254-0-image-a-353_1570545967163.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
