And now you've got multiple people trying to take them on, whether it's just Disney (DIS) or it's Apple (AAPL),\u201d she said.\n\nSo what does MANG stand for?\n\nMichelin (MGDDY) gets top spot in the roster and while it\u2019s considered a consumer discretionary it\u2019s actually a staple, argues Bhansali. After all she says, everyone has to replace their tires.\n\n\u201cThere is no discretion in that. So you're paying 2x a multiple of consumer discretionary. Twenty times earnings, and 2% yields. You can get Michelin on 10 times earnings and a 4% yield,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there is value in the market if you know how to look for it.\u201d\n\nFILE - This June 30, 2005 file photo shows a Michelin team technician writing on a Michelin tire in the paddock at Magny Cours circuit, central France, ahead the French Formula One Grand Prix. Michelin SCA's recent production cuts, made to adjust to sharply falling demand amid the global economic crisis, will cost euro 150 million ($209 million) in the fourth quarter, the French tire maker said Monday Dec.22, 2008. (AP Photo/Michel Spingler) More\n\nMoving on, she notes that the A can stand for Ahold (AD.AS), a food retailer, or Amdocs (DOX), a telecom billing software company (if you want to invest in something in the U.S.), and the letter N is for Nokia (NOK), which Bhansali called a great play on 5G.\n\n\u201cIn the 5G equipment market. It's actually the number two player in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, there are only two left in the world. And Huawei, as you know, is going to be on its knees. And so Ericsson and Nokia have the 5G arena a lot to themselves.\u201d\n\nThe G, according to Bhansali, could stand for Gilead (GILD) or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), representative of the overall strength of the health care sector.\n\nLooking beyond the standard basket of FAANG stocks and expanding portfolios to include MANG, \u201dout-of-favor, misunderstood, mispriced securities,\u201d said Bhansali, is the key to making money.\n\nYvette Killian is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nShaq on investing: 'I don\u2019t ever think about making money'\n\nWeWork 'has to give us a valuation that's reasonable': IPO expert\n\n5G will make devices more vulnerable to cyberattacks: Akamai CEO\n\nUS bankruptcy filings rose in July 2019 \u2014 what does that mean?\n\nGold prices can go a 'good deal higher': strategist\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Rupal Bhansali Ariel Investments CIO and portfolio manager of international and global equities says people should invest in MANG instead of FANG.", "authors": ["Yvette Killian"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aFbw56I09TiJMEEIAK1U4Q--~B/aD0xNjYwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/56da3750-e47c-11e9-bfb3-a0be28eac3b5", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
