When he sang, \u201cIt\u2019s a town full of losers and I\u2019m pulling out of here to win,\u201d he was talking about his hometown, but he could have been referring to mine.\n\nHis songs were always quintessentially American. I fell in love with America as it was depicted in his music: the rattlesnake speedways, the dusty arcades and yes, even the New Jersey Turnpike. In Springsteen\u2019s music I saw America as a land of hope and dreams. It was a nation that had its challenges but it was a generous-hearted place. If Britain would not accept me, I would be reborn in the U.S.A.\n\nThe first time I visited the United States was in 1990 when I took a Greyhound bus across the country before finally ending up in California, where I had a summer job selling encyclopedias door to door. Wherever I went people were intrigued by my British accent, but were always friendly and only dimly aware of Islam or Pakistan.\n\nThe Sept. 11 attacks significantly changed the Muslim experience of the United States. A year later, when I traveled to New Jersey for a Springsteen concert at the Giants Stadium, a man asked me how could he trust that I was a fan and not someone who was going to blow the stadium up. He asked me what my favorite Springsteen song was. I responded by listing a few titles that only true fans would have named.\n\nMy faith in America was tested. I kept hoping during the Bush years that the America I had fallen in love with as a teenager was not lost forever. My faith was rewarded with the election of Barack Obama, who embodied an idea that chimed with both me and Springsteen. During both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, Springsteen campaigned for Obama.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump into the White House marked the arrival of someone whose vision of America was the polar opposite of the vision articulated by Springsteen and Obama. Where Springsteen\u2019s America was open, welcoming and self-critical, Trump\u2019s America was narrow, fearful and arguably race-defined.\n\nI wrote a memoir about the influence of Springsteen on my experience of being a Muslim teenager in the 1980s small-town, working-class Britain, and it was recently turned into a movie and released in America.", "description": "The songwriter and singer gave hope to working-class boys in towns thousands of miles from New Jersey.", "authors": ["Sarfraz Manzoor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/opinion/06Manzoor/06Manzoor-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
