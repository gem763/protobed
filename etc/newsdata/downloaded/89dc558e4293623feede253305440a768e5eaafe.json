The company is collaborating with Apple and Alcoa (NYSE: ) AA.N to slash its carbon footprint by developing ways to make carbon-free aluminium. only way we can truly tackle climate change is through partnerships across the value chain,\" said Jacques.\n\nRio has pledged substantial decarbonisation by 2050 while larger rival BHP said in July it would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions. is also looking into generating battery-grade lithium carbonate from waste rock in California and testing new approaches at its Winu project in Australia, he said. added that the approach to doing business in a more environmentally-friendly way needs to be \"based on a pragmatic kind of sustainability. With profitability at its heart.\"\n\n\"Only a profitable business can provide sustainable benefits to shareholders, to communities, and governments.\"\n\nIn August, Rio announced its highest margins in a decade and a record dividend payout, part of an industry-wide recovery from the commodities crash of 2015-16.
