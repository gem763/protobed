The late rollout, which included the Apple Watch Series 5, means that sales of the latest iPhones won't have much of a material impact on its Q4 earnings.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook gestures after opening the newly renovated Apple Store at Fifth Avenue on September 20, 2019 in New York City.

According to Wedbush's Dan Ives, demand for the iPhone 11 in China are tracking 15% to 20% above expectations, and U.S. consumers are also believed to be snapping up more of the units.\n\nUBS analyst Timothy Arcuri also expects to see greater than expected iPhone 11 demand in the coming quarters, thanks to an improved trade-in program, the lower $699 price point for the base iPhone 11, and the fact that the iPhone 7, which has a large install base, is now three generations old.\n\nAs has been the narrative among analysts for some time, Apple's Services division will also be in the spotlight for the quarter. However, the impact of the company's Apple TV+ won't hit until the coming quarters, with the hotly anticipated streaming service preparing to launch on Nov. 1.\n\nApple will be offering a free year of the service with every new piece of hardware it sells, which should ensure a quick uptick in subscribers. There's been concern, though, that by using hardware to move Apple TV+ services, Apple will cut into the margins on its more profitable devices.\n\nApple's Q4 is generally one of its tougher quarterly comparisons, as more consumers hold off on purchasing new products ahead of the company's big iPhone event. As a result, analysts are expecting to see a slower quarter for iPhone sales.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Dan:\n\nGot a tip?
