But the top contenders were pretty busy already, hitting 47 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico even before the fall frenzy kicked off this month.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal asked each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the September Democratic debate to share how many campaign trips they had made to each state, including for public events and fundraising stops, from the time each of them got into the race through Labor Day.\n\nHitting the Campaign Trail States with early elections have been popular destinations for candidates through Labor Day. Campaign visits, by primary schedule Biden Warren Sanders Harris Buttigieg Yang Booker O\u2019Rourke Castro Klobuchar Early states (4) Super Tuesday(14) Home states In addition to traveling for 650 visits, candidates made 95 \u201cvisits\u201d to their home states March states (12) April states (11) Late states (11)\n\nHere are some of the top takeaways from 2020 Democrats\u2019 travel schedules:\n\nTrying to avoid Clinton\u2019s mistakes\n\nPresident Trump won the 2016 election by narrowly capturing Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point each. Some Democrats said former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost the latter two states because she didn\u2019t spend enough time there.\n\nPrimary vs. Battleground Focus Rust Belt states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin have racked up as many campaign visits as Nevada, a pivotal early state. Campaign visits Biden Warren Sanders Harris Buttigieg Yang Booker O\u2019Rourke Castro Klobuchar Nevada Feb. 25 Michigan More than half of the visits to rust belt states, 26, have been to Michigan Rust Belt states\n\nThe 2020 contenders are eager to avoid the same criticism. Candidates surveyed by the Journal have been to Michigan a total of 26 times, Wisconsin 10 times and Pennsylvania 13 times.\n\nThat is more trips to the Rust Belt than they have made to Nevada (45), the third state to hold its nominating contest.\n\nThe second Democratic presidential debate was held in Detroit, which brought all 10 candidates to Michigan.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden \u2014the last of the top 10 to get in the race, in April\u2014selected Pennsylvania as his campaign headquarters over his home state of Delaware, and he has made three trips to the state.\n\nIt\u2019s official: California is an early state\n\nCandidate visits to early voting states Iowa (Feb. 3) New Hampshire (Feb. 11) Despite being part of a busy Super Tuesday, California is getting attention like the earliest states on the calendar. Nevada (Feb. 22) South Carolina (Feb. 29) California (March 3, Super Tuesday)\n\nDelegate-rich California\u2019s primary was moved forward this cycle to March 3, the critical voting day known as Super Tuesday, from June in 2016. California\u2019s mail-in voting starts a month earlier, the same day Iowa voters go to the polls, and the state is home to generous liberal donors in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles.\n\nAll that means California\u2019s importance to the 2020 primaries has increased exponentially. The top candidates have been to California 58 times. The state is third only to Iowa (108) and New Hampshire (77).\n\nCharlie Cook, a nonpartisan political analyst who heads the Cook Political Report, said he was skeptical that spending so much time in California would pay off. Since 1972, the Democratic nominee has come in first, second or third in Iowa and first or second in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cAs people in California start their early voting, what\u2019s going to be dominating the news? Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cAll roads lead back to Iowa and New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nEarly-state priorities are clear for certain campaigns\n\nNo candidate on the September debate stage has made more visits to one state this year than Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has made to Iowa. She has traveled there 16 times. (Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has also made 16 trips, but he launched his campaign in November 2017, more than a year before most candidates began to jump in the race.) Ms. Klobuchar, of neighboring Minnesota, is pitching herself as a Heartland native.\n\nThe leading Democratic candidates look likely to share the same stage at the next presidential debate, after Tom Steyer failed to get the support needed to qualify, according to two polls. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib highlights three important things about the race. Photo composite: Getty/AP/EPA/Bloomberg/Zuma Press\n\nAs for New Hampshire, the state after Iowa on the nominating calendar, Ms. Warren has made more trips there than any other candidate. She has been there 15 times this year (Mr. Yang has been 14 times over two years). Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign is based across the state line in Boston, and her travel schedule follows Democratic conventional wisdom: Ms. Warren must put up a strong showing in her own backyard.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, by comparison, has made just six trips to New Hampshire.\n\nThe fundraising circuit makes Western states popular destinations\n\nThe candidates are known to frequent liberal enclaves like Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass., and the Hamptons on Long Island in New York.\n\nVisits with only fundraising events Biden Harris Harris went to New York to raise funds 11 times Buttigieg Yang Both campaign visits to Wyoming consisted only of fundraising events Booker Klobuchar\n\nA handful of candidates are also hitting another fertile ground for fundraising: a smattering of Western states, including Idaho, Wyoming, Washington and Colorado. Some candidates, such as Mr. Biden, have flown in, collected checks and left without making a single public appearance.\n\nIn early August, Mr. Biden addressed 90 people\u2014who paid $2,800 each to attend\u2014at the Sun Valley, Idaho, home of a former U.S. ambassador. In June, Mr. Biden was hosted at the Seattle home of public-relations executive Roger Nyhus. About 50 guests sipped wine and ate crab cakes as Mr. Nyhus, in introducing the former vice president, joked that his own home was nicknamed the \u201cWhite House.\u201d\n\nNo fundraisers means more campaigning for Warren, Sanders\n\nMs. Warren and Mr. Sanders aren\u2019t participating in private, big-ticket fundraisers. Their campaigns say that frees up their schedules to reach more voters. They appear to have a point: Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have hosted public events in more states than many of their rivals.\n\nThrough Labor Day, Ms. Warren held public events in 26 states and Puerto Rico, not including her home state of Massachusetts. That was more than any other top candidate. She has hosted more than 100 town halls, where supporters wait, sometimes for hours, to take a photo with her. Not including Vermont, Mr. Sanders has campaigned in 19 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nMs. Warren has attracted massive crowds at events held away from the early primary states. In late August, she pulled the largest crowds of her campaign: 12,000 attendees in St. Paul, Minn., followed days later by 15,000 people in Seattle.\n\n\u201c[Democratic presidential candidates] should go to the places they sneaked by last time,\u201d said Terry Mitchell, 66, who attended Ms. Warren\u2019s rally in Minnesota, which Mr. Trump lost by 1.5 percentage points.\n\nCandidates stump in delegate-rich Deep South\n\nThe candidates, in an attempt to introduce themselves to African-Americans, are making swings through the Deep South, including for big conferences and other \u201ccattle call\u201d events, such as the Black Church PAC presidential candidate forum in Atlanta in August.\n\nCampaign visits in the Deep South Biden Warren Sanders Harris Buttigieg Yang Booker O\u2019Rourke Castro Klobuchar As an early primary state, South Carolina\u2019s 56 visits are more about gaining early wins than connecting with Southern voters. Miss. Ala. Ga. La. Changing demographics in Georgia have made it a more popular campaign stop over the last two years.\n\nMrs. Clinton locked up the nomination in 2016 by sweeping the South; Barack Obama did the same in 2008.\n\n2020 Democrats are trying to mimic that strategy. Ms. Warren, for example, took a tour of Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma, Ala., in March.\n\n\u201cYou have a group of voters, a group of citizens, who are concerned about a particular set of issues, and they meet at a particular place at a particular time,\u201d said Pastor Leah Daughtry of Brooklyn, N.Y., a founding member of the Black Church PAC. \u201c[Presidential candidates] need to meet the voters where they are.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico is on the map\n\nPuerto Rico residents can vote in the Democratic primary, but not until June, when most states will have voted. Residents don\u2019t get electoral votes in the general election.\n\nStill, Ms. Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Ms. Klobuchar have all visited the island at least once. Democrats have sought to contrast their efforts to get aid to the island following two brutal storms in 2017 to the president\u2019s attempts to limit funds and his criticism of the island\u2019s government.\n\nCandidates see long-term strategy in red states\n\nPresidential candidates generally put states into three categories: early primary states, competitive general-election states and states full of wealthy donors. But there are a handful of states that don\u2019t fit any of those buckets where Democrats are showing up anyway.\n\nCampaign visits by state political lean Early states 4 states Early states tend to get attention regardless of their political leaning, as candidates try to secure early wins. Super Tuesday 14 states March states 12 states April states 11 states It is rarer for Democrats to woo Republican states that are later in the calendar and less likely to play a role in the primary, as Sanders did in Kentucky. Late states 11 states\n\nMr. Sanders held a rally in Kentucky in August. Ms. Warren had an opioid-focused event in a West Virginia fire station in May. Ms. Klobuchar met with voters in June at a North Dakota coffee shop and brewery, and former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke met families affected by immigration raids in a grocery store in Mississippi.\n\nJeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, acknowledged it could be an uphill battle for Democrats to win states like Kentucky, but he said the campaign stops will help the party grow.\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders wants to telegraph that he is prepared for the mantle of leadership, in terms of being the head of the Democratic Party, that he is prepared to expand the reach of the party into every state,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cWe are no longer going to concede a large number of states to the Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think he has a chance against Donald Trump in the state of Kentucky. I don\u2019t think Kentucky is ready to switch,\u201d said Ryan Conard, a doctor who attended Mr. Sanders\u2019s rally in Louisville. But Mr. Conard was hopeful that the state would flip over time: \u201cExposure is everything. The squeaky wheel gets the oil, right? So the more his message is heard\u2026I think it\u2019s going to change.\u201d\n\nThere are just three states no top candidate has visited\n\nThree states have received zero visits: Hawaii, Montana and Alaska. (Montana Gov. Steve Bullock \u2019s presidential campaign is based in Helena, but he didn\u2019t make the September debate.)\n\nMr. Castro has pledged to visit all 50 states\u2014a promise meant to both draw attention to his candidacy and differentiate himself. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid of a small crowd,\u201d said campaign manager Maya Rupert.\n\nMethodology\n\nA visit was defined as a round-trip to the state for a candidate\u2019s presidential campaign, regardless of the number of events during the visit. The Journal didn\u2019t include trips to candidates\u2019 home states; however, it did include visits to a state where a campaign placed its headquarters if it was a different location than the candidate\u2019s home state and the candidate was there for events, not just administrative work.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com and Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com.", "description": "The Wall Street Journal asked each of the 10 candidates who qualified for the September Democratic debate to share how many campaign trips they had made to each state.
