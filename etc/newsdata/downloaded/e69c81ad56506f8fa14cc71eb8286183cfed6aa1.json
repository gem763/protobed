We didn\u2019t respond to this unprovoked attack. We are prepared to defend the people and the people of NE #Syria,\u201d the SDF said.\n\nBorder skirmishes between Turkish and Kurdish forces have taken place before, and there was no indication the latest reported shelling was part of a broader offensive.\n\nBut Fahrettin Altun, Turkey\u2019s communications director wrote in the Washington Post that Turkish military units would \u201ccross the Turkish-Syrian border shortly.\u201d\n\nKurdish forces can either \u201cdefect\u201d or Turkey will \u201chave no choice but to stop them from disrupting our counter-Islamic State efforts,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2013 Long-planned attack \u2013\n\nTrump has blown hot and cold since a surprise announcement on Sunday that Washington was pulling back 50 to 100 \u201cspecial operators\u201d from Syria\u2019s northern frontier.\n\nThe troops had served as a buffer preventing a long-planned attack by Turkey against Kurdish forces, who were crucial in the campaign to defeat the Islamic State group but are viewed as \u201cterrorists\u201d by Ankara.\n\nAfter appearing to give a green light to the Turkish invasion on Sunday, he later threatened to \u201cobliterate\u201d Turkey\u2019s economy if it went too far.\n\nBut he also gave a warm account of Turkey in other tweets and announced that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would visit Washington on November 13.\n\n\u201cSo many people conveniently forget that Turkey is a big trading partner of the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nAnkara had already brushed aside Trump\u2019s warnings, with Vice-President Fuat Oktay saying: \u201cTurkey is not a country that will act according to threats.\u201d\n\nTurkey has always pushed hard against US support for Kurdish forces in Syria due to their links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) which has fought a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.\n\n\u2013 Kurds have been \u2018tossed aside\u2019 \u2013\n\nMeanwhile, the Syrian government has welcomed the upheaval, spying an opportunity to bring the country\u2019s Kurds back into its fold.\n\nThe Kurds have been \u201ctossed aside\u201d by Washington, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad told the pro-government Al-Watan newspaper.\n\nTrump rejected that interpretation, tweeting: \u201cWe may be in the process of leaving Syria, but in no way have we Abandoned the Kurds, who are special people and wonderful fighters.\u201d\n\nThe SDF says it lost some 11,000 fighters as the main frontline force against the Islamic State group.\n\nBritain said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by Turkey\u2019s plans to attack Kurdish fighters, who lead the SDF.\n\nIran, a key backer of the Syrian government, also opposed a Turkish incursion, with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urging \u201crespect for Syria\u2019s territorial integrity\u201d in a call to Ankara.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Safe zone\u2019 \u2013\n\nRussia\u2019s security council said it was important to avoid hindering the peace process in Syria.\n\nTurkey says it wants to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees from the eight-year civil war.\n\nErdogan said Monday that the operation into Syria could \u201ccome any night without warning\u201d.\n\nKurds argue that Ankara\u2019s goal is to dilute their dominance in the region with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees now living in Turkey.\n\nTrump has faced a barrage of criticism, including from close allies in Washington, for appearing to leave the Kurds to their fate.\n\nA Turkish attack also raises the spectre of what will happen to some 10,000 Islamic State group fighters currently held in Kurdish detention centres.\n\nAround 2,000 of them are IS \u201cforeign fighters\u201d, and Trump assailed US allies in Europe for not taking back their nationals.\n\nIf they escape or are released, there are fears that they could reconstitute IS, less than one year after it was defeated and its \u201ccaliphate\u201d disintegrated.\n\nTrump declared that it would be the responsibility of Turkey and other countries to deal with IS prisoners.\n\nburs-er/txw/dcr/pvh/nla/rma/jah", "description": "Akcakale (Turkey) (AFP) \u2013 Turkey said Tuesday it would \u201cshortly\u201d begin an offensive into northern Syria as President Donald Trump", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/fa8aa8_turkey-military-vehicles-border-syria-on-tuesday-turkey-syria-offensive-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
