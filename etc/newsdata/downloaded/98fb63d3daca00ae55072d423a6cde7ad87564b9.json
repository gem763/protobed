Nothing is excessive and everything is purposeful, but it\u2019s a sterile place to exist, where function trumps comfort.\n\nThe truth is, I don\u2019t always want this kind of life.\n\nJust like Amtrak citing prepackaged meals as a chic and contemporary workaround to a prepared meal, the emphasis on ease \u2014 on maximizing every second \u2014 is supposed to be sexy. But it can feel exhausting.\n\nThe idea that young people like me are always on the go, always in transition and always on masks that we might actually desire slowness, want to relish an experience, or enjoy taking a moment to feel comfortable and human instead of curated and optimized.\n\nOur experiences at work, in our homes and even in transit can be chopped up into pieces of purpose and service. Anything else \u2014 any lingering, any human ity \u2014 can feel superfluous, or even wasteful, especially for a generation scapegoated as entitled for wanting things that used to be considered basic. It\u2019s as though doing more (even when we\u2019re doing something as simple and sedentary as riding a train) with less is always the ultimate goal.\n\nIt\u2019s not difficult to see why, when an advertisement highlighting convenience and quickness pops up, we believe maybe this really is the thing that will make life better. Maybe this is what \u201ccontemporary\u201d looks like. But I wish small things \u2014 meals on a train, unplanned moments that can\u2019t be logged as self-improvement or furniture that is owned \u2014 didn\u2019t feel old-fashioned. I wish people knew that my generation wants more than to optimize our lives, or to feel trendy because of how fast we\u2019re hustling. I wish slowing down didn\u2019t feel like a luxury.\n\nRainesford Stauffer is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cAn Ordinary Age.\u201d\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
