He is due to join National Australia Bank NAB.AX as their next chief executive.\n\nRose has worked at the bank for 27 years and takes on the role at a pivotal time for the lender, as British banks prepare for the economic fallout if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal next month.\n\nShe will also be tasked with further patching up RBS's damaged reputation and trying to return the bank to private hands, more than a decade after its 45 billion pound state rescue in the financial crisis.\n\n\"Following a rigorous internal and external process, I am confident that we have appointed the best person for the job,\" RBS Chairman Howard Davies said in a statement.\n\nRose will receive a fixed base salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.38 million)a year plus a fixed share allowance set at 100% of her salary. That's up slightly from McEwan who has a base pay of 1 million pounds a year, plus a 100% fixed share allowance.\n\nHowever Rose's pension will be set at 10% of her salary in line with other RBS employees, compared to McEwan who is receiving 350,000 pounds a year in pension funding.\n\nBritish banks have been criticized by investors this year for giving their executives more favorable pension arrangements than the rest of their workforce.", "description": "Royal Bank of Scotland has appointed Alison Rose as its new chief executive, becoming the first major British lender to appoint a woman to its top job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105040296-GettyImages-805627922.jpg?v=1532563676", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
