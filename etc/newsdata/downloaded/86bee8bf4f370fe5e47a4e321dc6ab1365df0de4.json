As the animal bites down, blue liquid bursts from his mouth, announcing that the Josephs are expecting a boy.\n\nFilmmaker Ana Bret\u00f3n shared the footage on Twitter in a post that now has more than 8.3 million views. Her tweet described the idea as \"the worst gender reveal.\"\n\nI did it. I found the worst gender reveal. pic.twitter.com/37b5GkrTbN\n\n\u2014 Ana Bret\u00f3n (@missbreton) September 21, 2019\n\nTwitter users quickly jumped in with jokes, while some also added serious criticism of the decision to use a live animal for the announcement.\n\n\"When he said 'thank god' I was even more disgusted,\" one person tweeted. \"Throw the whole couple away also is the hippo okay?\"\n\n\"Did they give that poor hippo chemicals?\" another said.\n\nWhen he said \u201cthank god\u201d I was even more disgusted. Throw the whole couple away also is the hippo okay?\n\n\u2014 Portia\ud83d\udc7e\ud83d\udd79 (@GrooovyArts) September 21, 2019\n\nOthers took issue with the fact that the Josephs appeared specifically excited to be having a boy.\n\n\"The 'thank god' because it\u2019s a boy because apparently having a girl would be HORRIBLE,\" one person tweeted.\n\nThe \u201cthank god\u201d because it\u2019s a boy because apparently having a girl would be HORRIBLE \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude21\n\n\u2014 Kate (@KTenpas) September 21, 2019\n\nBut the Josephs were ready to defend those critiques. On Sunday, Bret\u00f3n tweeted out a message she'd received from the couple, as well as an explanation of her own reaction to the viral video.\n\n\"While I\u2019m not a fan of gender reveals, it was not my intention to bring darkness to their special day,\" Bret\u00f3n said.\n\nIn the message, the Bridgette called the event \"one of the happiest days\" of her and her husband's lives, clarifying that the blue liquid was actually organic Jell-O that was completely safe for Tank to eat.\n\n\"Tank was more than happy to have the treat,\" Bridgette said. \"He walked right to us and opened his mouth.\"\n\nHi all! I\u2019ve been in touch with the family in the video. While I\u2019m not a fan of gender reveals, it was not my intention to bring darkness to their special day. Here\u2019s some background written by Bridgette.

According to the message, the couple already has a daughter, and Bridgette had been undergoing fertility treatments with the specific intention of trying for a boy.\n\n\"We would have been over the moon just the same to have another girl, but would have had to keep trying for a boy\" Bridgette's message read. \"Can't wait to meet him.\"", "description": "A Texas couple is speaking out after their unusual gender reveal went viral and received backlash on Twitter.", "authors": ["Dillon Thompson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/P31pQQANtozKUkcLeA98DA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/828x543+0+44/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/4bfe38c0-e078-11e9-9b55-8957c5217efe", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
