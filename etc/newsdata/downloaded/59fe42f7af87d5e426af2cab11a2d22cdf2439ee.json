Christensen and Barkley are both out as well.\"\n\nAsked how long he expects Kante to be out, Lampard said: \"We need to get him right now. I don\u2019t know. I just want him fit.\"\n\n(Image: Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\nLampard said he thought both Kante and Rudiger were struggling with injuries from last season.\n\nThe manager said of Kante: \"He might be suffering from the big injury at the end of last season. There is no time-frame at the moment.\n\n\"Rudiger had a bad injury, this is a fall-out of last season, that is the nature of it. We need to remember that, but he is close.\"\n\nThe injuries mean Chelsea look likely to continue with Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori in the centre of defence, while Mateo Kovacic is likely to keep his place in midfield in the absence of Barkley.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nChristensen and Barkley could return for Chelsea's next Premier League game, away to Watford next Saturday. Before that they host Manchester United in the fourth round of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.\n\nEighth-placed Burnley are just five points behind Chelsea in fourth, and Lampard is expecting a tough ride at Turf Moor.\n\nLampard said: \"It\u2019s a tough place to go. They have a strong way of playing, they are well drilled. They can give you big problems.\n\n\"It is a tough match. You have to respect the teams you play - it will be a physical battle.\"", "description": "Club legend expects tough encounter at Turf Moor", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727857.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-Training-and-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
