Neither of the girls were competitive rowers prior to enrolling at the university.\n\nThe Department of Justice claims that Loughin and nine other defendants \u201cconspired to commit federal program bribery by bribing employees of the University of Southern California (USC) to facilitate their children\u2019s admission.\u201d Both Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were charged on Tuesday with one count of conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery.\n\nAn anonymous source told People magazine that she is terrified over the prospect of spending time in prison. Now, according to the source, Loughlin fears an especially harsh sentence for her role in the bribery scandal due to the national media attention on the case.\n\n\u201cThey feel like this is David versus Goliath. How do you go up against the federal government, when the government has decided to make an example out of you? How can you possibly move forward from this?\u201d the anonymous source said.\n\n\u201cIt just gets worse and worse for her. And you have to remember: nothing new has happened. They could have charged her with all of this last spring. But they waited,\u201d the anonymous source added. \u201cShe feels like she is a scapegoat.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News reported in August that Loughlin had allegedly defended her role in the scam by arguing that she thought that all wealthy Americans bribe colleges in exchange for their children\u2019s admission.\n\nBreitbart News reported in September that actress Felicity Huffman had been sentenced to 14 days in prison for her role in the scam. Huffman had paid $15,000 to a company that provided her daughter with an SAT proctor that modified her answers, thus increasing her score, prior to submission of the exam. Huffman is scheduled for release on October 27.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more on the Varsity Blues college admissions scandal.", "description": "Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, along with other defendants in the \"Varsity Blues\" college admissions bribery scandal, were hit with additional charges on Tuesday over their role in the scam.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/uu-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
