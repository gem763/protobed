REUTERS/Charles Platiau\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - An ornate tapestry woven in the early 1800s and rescued from Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral after a massive fire in April is going on public display for only the third time in recent decades.\n\nDonated to the cathedral in 1841 by King Louis-Philippe of France, the 25-metre (82 ft) long rug with its colourful cornucopias and vivid crowns of flowers was historically rolled out on special occasions, including the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1980.\n\nWhen firefighters hauled the water-logged rug from the blackened interior of the cathedral days after the April 15 inferno it weighed two tons, twice its usual weight.\n\nRestorers used a wind tunnel to help dry the tapestry before freezing it to kill off any fungi and parasites that might eat away at the weaving, said Herve Lemoine, director of France\u2019s Mobilier National, which oversees the country\u2019s collection of valuable furniture and artworks.\n\n\u201cIt suffered water damage during the operation to contain the fire. As you can imagine, with the heat of the fire, and also because at that time we were entering into summer, there was a risk fungi and parasites could damage the weaving,\u201d Le Moine said.\n\nThe tapestry has only been on public display twice in the past 30 years. It will be open to public view at the Mobilier National during Paris\u2019 European Heritage Days on Sept. 21-22.", "description": "An ornate tapestry woven in the early 1800s and rescued from Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral after a massive fire in April is going on public display for only the third time in recent decades.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429504911&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C1SM", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
