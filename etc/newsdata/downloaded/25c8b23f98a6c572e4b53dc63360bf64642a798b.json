They want to stay the same size,\" said Fricker, a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California.\n\nThe gain in mass comes from snow falling on the continent and glaciers that move slowly toward the shore.\n\nThe east of Antarctica -- where D28 broke off -- is different from the west of the continent and Greenland, which are rapidly warming due to climate change.\n\n\"It's really important that the public doesn't get confused and think that this is climate change,\" Fricker said.\n\nAn iceberg that was three times larger broke off Antarctica two years ago, she said, causing panic at the time.\n\n\"It's a fine line because we definitely don't want people to think that climate change isn't happening,\" Fricker added.", "description": "A more than 600-square-mile iceberg broke off Antarctica in recent days, but the event is part of a normal cycle and is not related to climate change, scientists say.
