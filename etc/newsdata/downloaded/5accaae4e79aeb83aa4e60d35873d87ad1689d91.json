Meanwhile, local politicians admitted they had lost control of the refugee camps to Isis radicals.\n\nDr Abdulkarim Omar, the de facto foreign secretary of the self-styled Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, and the co-chair of its foreign affairs committee, said: \u201cWe call for the establishment of an international tribunal to prosecute those fighters here in our region.\n\n\u201cThose people, the Isis criminals, committed their crimes in our region and against our communities. Evidence, proof and witnesses against them are in this region, and we can prosecute them.\u201d\n\nOmar, speaking before pictures of the prison interiors were published in the Times, admitted his administration was struggling with the postwar legacy. Omar said the region only received \u201c5% of the resources it needs\u201d from the international community to help. Officials repeatedly described the prisons and camps as a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d.\n\nEstimates of the number of Isis fighters in detention vary. The administration puts the figure at 6,000, including 1,000 foreigners, but others say the true number is double that. Some have been in custody for two or more years without trial after Isis sustained a series of battlefield defeats.\n\nRefugee camps hold in excess of 100,000 people, mostly women and children, with the largest, the al-Hawl camp, holding more than 70,000.\n\nInside al-Hawl camp, the incubator for Islamic State's resurgence Read more\n\nIsis lost the last of its territory in March, defeated by the primarily Kurdish members of the Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) with military support from a US-led coalition, marking the end of an eight-year war that killed 12,000 troops. What was initially a Kurdish territory on the Turkish border has become a multi-ethnic region of 5 million people, east of the Euphrates River, and separate from the areas controlled by President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nBritish sources estimate that just over 60 adult Britons \u2013 an equal mix of men and women \u2013 are being held in detention or are living in camps in north-east Syria. The UK has made little effort to repatriate them.\n\nIn two high-profile cases, the UK has stripped citizenship from Shamima Begum and Jack Letts. Two others accused of murdering western hostages \u2013 Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh \u2013 may be extradited to the US.\n\nMap of Syria Map of Syria\n\nTwo British MPs who went on a fact-finding mission to north-east Syria last month, including a visit to a refugee camp, said the UK had a \u201cdebt of honour\u201d to help those who fought Isis on the ground, and said the situation in the prisons and camps was critical.\n\nLloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP who chairs the parliamentary group on north-east Syria, said the local authorities needed western help: \u201cThe time bomb of captured Isis fighters and radicalised families is beyond the capacity of north-east Syria to address. Failure to prioritise this would be international security negligence of the first order.\u201d\n\nThe MPs also criticised the UK for not recognising north-east Syria politically, with ministers refusing to meet administration officials when they visited London earlier this year.\n\nAnother member of the delegation, the Conservative MP and former prisons minister Crispin Blunt, said: \u201cSo far the shirking of our nation\u2019s responsibility has been wholly shameful.\u201d He called on Boris Johnson to \u201creverse this position with due urgency\u201d.\n\nThe lack of local control has prompted concerns that there could be a repeat of what happened in Iraq in the aftermath of the US invasion, where Isis leaders congregated in, and were further radicalised at Camp Bucca. Last month, Isis\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, released an audio message calling on Isis fighters to liberate prisoners and those living in refugee camps.\n\nThe US, which has 1,000 troops in the region, is opposed to the creation of a local war crime tribunal. It wants foreign fighters to be repatriated and put on trial in their home countries.\n\nWhitehall sources argue that problems with collecting evidence that could stand up in a British court mean it may only be possible to charge returnees with membership of a banned organisation, which carries a maximum 10-year sentence.\n\nControl of refugee camps, such as al-Hawl, is increasingly in the hands of \u201cradical women\u201d from Tunisia, Somalia and Russia. On their recent visit, the MPs heard aid workers report that their tents were burned down and they are regularly pelted with stones.\n\nSixteen British families are among the 12,700 people from outside Syria and Iraq living in al-Hawl, according to the local administration, though there is limited evidence that any sustained effort has been made to establish details about who is in the camp. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done any fingerprinting or any ID,\u201d one of the British politicians said.\n\nConservative dress codes were strictly enforced. Members of the SDF guarding the camp said a mother killed her daughter with a hammer for not wearing the chador and her body was left out in the camp as a warning to others.\n\nLocal politicians said the UK and other countries should be prepared to repatriate children born to Isis members, as part of a deradicalisation programme. \u201cThese children are victims, their only guilt is that they belong to parents who joined Isis,\u201d Omar said.\n\nDescribing the children in the camp, who are from 55 countries beyond Syria and Iraq, as \u201cthe cubs of the caliphate\u201d, Omar said: \u201cIf we do not address this problem and provide rehabilitation for some of them, we expect a future of terrorists.\u201d\n\nSome countries, such as France and Belgium, have taken in a few orphaned children, but a recent review led by the Home Office concluded that children in Syria with a claim to British citizenship should be left there.\n\nOver the weekend, however, it was reported that Johnson was considering whether to authorise a raid by UK special forces to repatriate children born to British parents.", "description": "Politicians in Kurdish-led region call for international help to de-radicalise region", "authors": ["Dan Sabbagh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a1bdb6c767a156e1f1177a659769df017719c7c/0_346_5192_3115/master/5192.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=37e8dd1b0526363e2a7eda94373d0e0a"}
