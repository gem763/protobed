Beijing is developing weapons such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers that are helping it expand the range and scope of military operations.\n\nOnce largely confined to operating close to the Chinese coast, Beijing now routinely sends its air and sea patrols near Japan's western Okinawa islands and into the Western Pacific.\n\nChina has frequently rebuffed concerns about its military spending and intentions, including a ramped-up presence in the disputed South China Sea, and says it only desires peaceful development.\n\nThe Defense White Paper said Chinese patrols in waters and skies near Japanese territory are \"a national security concern\".\n\nThe paper downgraded fellow U.S. ally, South Korea, which recently pulled out of an intelligence sharing pact with Japan amid a spat over their shared wartime history. That could weaken efforts to contain North Korean threats, analysts said.\n\nOther partners, including Australia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India, feature more prominently in the defense paper.\n\n\"It's a reflection of the level of cooperation we undertake with each partner,\" a defense ministry official said at an earlier briefing.\n\nSouth Korean government officials took issue with the White Paper's reference to ownership of an island in the Sea of Japan that is also claimed and controlled by South Korea. The outcrop is known as Dokdo in Seoul and Takeshima in Tokyo.\n\n\"Our government strongly protests Japan's repeated claim. The Japanese government should acknowledge that it is not helpful for bilateral relations,\" South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement.", "description": "China's growing military might has replaced North Korean belligerence as the main security threat to Japan, Tokyo's annual defense review indicated on Thursday, despite signs that Pyongyang could have nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106151706-1569556900166gettyimages-1175195801.jpeg?v=1569557099", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
