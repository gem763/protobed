If you've watched his television series Still Standing, you'll know that these aren't roasts, but rather celebrations of small towns.\n\nHarris' comedy gives audiences a real sense of the communities he's visiting, what they've survived together and how neighbours band together to help each other out. Ahead of the show's fifth season, Harris joined q's Tom Power to look back at some of the highlights from Still Standing.\n\nThe new season of Still Standing premieres on CBC on Tuesday, Sept. 17. You can also catch Harris in the new season of Murdoch Mysteries tonight on CBC and CBC Gem.\n\nDownload our podcast or click 'Listen' near the top of this page to hear the full conversation with Jonny Harris.\n\n\u2014 Produced by \u200bEmma Godmere", "description": "Ahead of the fifth season of CBC's Still Standing, comedian Jonny Harris joins q's Tom Power to look back at some of the highlights from the show.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5283137.1568638493!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/jonny-harris.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
