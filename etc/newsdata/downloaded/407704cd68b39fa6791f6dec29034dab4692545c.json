It seems South Africa chose to give the ANC a light tongue-lashing, while DA support declined for the first time ever. The EFF keeps chugging along while the Freedom Front Plus is making a comeback. The national results centre in Pretoria was an interesting joint on Thursday night. Pieter du Toit reports.\n\nThere were some big smiles among senior ANC leaders at the IEC\u2019s Results Operational Centre at the old Pretoria Showgrounds in Soutter Street on Thursday evening.\n\n\u201cIt could have been worse,\u201d one ANC figure, tipped to play an increasingly prominent role in President Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s government, said as he was mulling about in the cavernous hall. He seemed relieved.\n\nAnd he had reason to be. The governing party, beset by corruption, capture and poor governance looks set to settle on 57,1% of support and will quite possibly hold on to Gauteng. Sure, the ANC lost support (five percentage points ain\u2019t nothing to sneeze at) but it wasn\u2019t anywhere near the collapse some predicted and others wished for.\n\nOver on the DA\u2019s side things were testy. The party, that has shown exponential growth since 1994 (and seems perenially poised for a breakthrough among black voters), was faring badly. News24\u2019s elections analyst projects that it will shed support and come in below its number of 22% in 2014.\n\nMaybe not disastrous, but certainly a calamity. Almost 350 000 white voters desterted the party, most of them in favour of the conservative Freedom Front Plus. \u201cYou guys always make a fucking mountain out of a molehill,\u201d DA federal chairperson Athol Trollip responded when asked about their losses. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make an issue about Ramaphosa losing votes?\u201d\n\nAnd Dali Mpofu, the EFF\u2019s chairperson, said they\u2019ll \u201cdefinitely\u201d break the magical 10% barrier. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to double our support\u2026 oh yes, double,\u201d he said when visiting News24\u2019s makeshift office at the ROC.\n\nWho were the winners in this election, and who were the losers? Before the public went to the polls, analyst Ralph Mathekga said he\u2019d be disapppointed if South Africans\u2019 voices don\u2019t come through loud and clear. Results suggest Mathekga won\u2019t be happy.\n\n***\n\nThe ANC entered this election in a perilous state.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa was the only \u2013 the only \u2013 redeeming factor in a party that has been ravaged by internicine battles, where its own secretary-general (besides being the central figure in a capture network) was working against its leader and on the back of a disastrous era under former president Jacob Zuma.\n\nIts scandals have been front and centre of national discourse for years, its finances are in a dire state (the party is allegedly preparing to lay off staff) and the government it leads is paralysed by poor policy, a poor economy and even worse governance.\n\nTo be clear, 57,1% is hardly a triumph. Slumping to below 60% in a general election could hasten its demise and the 2024 election could very well be the one where it might just lose its majority. The party has been on a downward trajectory since 2004 (69,69% under then president Thabo Mbeki) and the slip from 62,15% to 57,1% is the largest in its electoral history.\n\nThe EFF, a party born out of the ANC and blessed with the African nationalist DNA of Africa\u2019s oldest liberation movement, was the direct beneficiary of the ANC\u2019s decline. In almost all the northern provinces ANC losses translated to EFF gains.\n\nAnd on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal, where the ANC historically nurtured one of its most loyal voting blocks (more than 2,5m voters) the EFF quadrupled its support and the ANC declined from 85% to 73% among its traditional supporters. That\u2019s significant, because KZN is where the party\u2019s support is anchored. And the EFF made serious inroads.\n\nBut in Gauteng it looks as if the rapid decline between 2009 and 2014, and expected to continue apace, was stopped just short of the electoral cliff. The ANC in the province have had a torrid time of it since 2013 when it openly turned against Zuma. It shed more than 10 percentage points in 2014 and in 2016 lost control of the metropolitan municipalities of Tshwane and Johannesburg.\n\nAnd even though it looks set to lose another three percentage points to take it to the brink, it isn\u2019t half as bad as the previous drop.\n\n***\n\nThey might not admit it (and Trollip didn\u2019t want to) but if the DA cannot capitalise on the malaise in the ANC, during a time when the governing party is at its absolute weakest, bereft of authority and staring down the barrel, will they ever be able to?\n\nThere is a realisation in certain quarters of the party that the last 18 months were \u201ca shit show\u201d with, among other issues, the Patricia de Lille debacle and the party\u2019s management of the Afrikaans teacher at Schweizer-Reneke. And its initial uncertainty on how to deal with Ramaphoria and the \u201cnew dawn\u201d.\n\nThat it managed to put together a coherent campaign and didn\u2019t shed three or four percentage points was sold as evidence of the party\u2019s resilience.\n\nBut it lost in the region of 350 000 white supporters which will in all probability translate into a net loss in the final tally. And it hasn\u2019t seemed to offset those losses with noteworthy gains among the black electorate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a winning loss. We lost some conservative voters,\u201d one DA operator explained.\n\nBut how is a net loss a winning one? \u201cDepends on who you ask in the party,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd what about the loss in support? Do you want those voters back? \u201cThat\u2019s a debate the party is going to have to conduct.\u201d\n\nAnd were the (negligible?) gains among black voters worth the loss? \u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAlready there\u2019s talk of some DA figures mobilising and asking questions of the party leadership.\n\nWhen he visited the ROC on Thursday night DA leader Mmusi Maimane looked tired and under pressure. And he seemed to snap at a question by News24\u2019s Tshidi Madia about the DA\u2019s bloodied nose among the white electorate. \u201cWe\u2019ll never become a nationalist party, we\u2019ll never be a party for only black or white or coloured or Indian. I\u2019m comfortable and content where we are\u2026 we didn\u2019t compromise our principles.\u201d\n\nWouter Wessels, a FF+ MP, said his party capitalised on white frustration on issues like race. And the DA seemed weak on that score. \u201cYes, the Schweizer-Reneke incident was a game changer for us,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nWhat about the EFF? Mpofu seemed upbeat, but a 100%, 120% increase in the party\u2019s support was very, very far off.\n\nThe party will increase their support and send a stronger contingent to Parliament. It will also be the official opposition in a number of provinces. But will its increased support indicate a strong swing away from the ANC towards the party?\n\nSouth Africa will reset itself next week. New battles will begin as a new Parliament and a new government readies itself to take up the cudgels.\n\nThe ANC leader who admitted \u201cit could have been worse\u201d left the ROC breathing a sigh of relief and muttering a silent \u201camandla\u201d.\n\nA highly-strung Maimane left the ROC with an irritable Trollip in tow.\n\nAnd on the floor of the ROC, Mpofu was massaging the assembled media pack, with nary a sign of Julius Malema.\n\nFind everything you need to know about the 2019 National and Provincial Government Elections at our News24 Elections site, including the latest news and detailed, interactive maps for how South Africa has voted over the past 3 elections.
