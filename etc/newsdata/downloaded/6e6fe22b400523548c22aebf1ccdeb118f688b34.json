There's no country in the world that leaks like we do, and Washington is a leaking machine. And I told my people we will not notify them until our great people are out \u2014 not just in but out. I don't want to have them greeted with firepower like you wouldn't believe.\"\n\nWhat we know: The president did not inform House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel or Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith of the raid. Smith's office has reached out to the Defense Department to determine why there was no pre- or post-raid call with congressional leaders, according to NBC News' Alex Moe.\n\nTrump said he did, however, inform the Russian government that U.S. soldiers were conducting an operation in northwestern Syria.\n\nPelosi celebrated the death of Baghdadi in a statement on Sunday, but added: \"The House must be briefed on this raid, which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance, and on the Administration\u2019s overall strategy in the region. Our military and allies deserve strong, smart and strategic leadership from Washington.\"\n\nOf note: Fox New's Chris Wallace today pressed Vice President Mike Pence on why Trump did not notify Pelosi of the operation. The vice president did not give a direct answer, according to CNN's Oliver Darcy.\n\nGo deeper ...
