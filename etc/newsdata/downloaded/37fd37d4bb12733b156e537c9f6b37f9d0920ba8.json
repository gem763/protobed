Protesters are angry both that authorities have started closing parts of the MTR network prevent people gathering for protests or dispersing afterwards, and also that police have attacked protesters in stations.\n\nAuthorities said the entire network will shut four hours early at 6pm, to allow for repairs. With more protests planned for the evening, that will also make it harder for demonstrators to cross the city.\n\nThe mask ban was brought in under the colonial-era emergency regulations ordinance, which gives Chief Executive Carrie Lam virtually unlimited power.\n\nThe emergency powers have not been used for over half a century, and never since the handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Critics say that their use is unjustified, and a first step towards authoritarianism. Lam has hinted that she might use it to roll out harsher measures including a curfew if protests continue.\n\nHong Kong protesters defy the mask ban \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nHong Kong\u2019s last governor Chris Patten joined attacks on Lam for her government\u2019s heavy-handed approach, warning that the situation was likely to escalate further unless she started negotiations with protesters.\n\n\u201cThe way forward is to engage with the demonstrators, particularly the peaceful demonstrators,\u201d he told Sky news, highlighting two incidents in which teenagers were seriously injured by armed police.\n\n\u201cBefore long, unless we\u2019re very, very lucky, people are going to get killed, people are going to get shot. The idea that with public order policing, you send police forces out with live bullets, with live ammunition, is preposterous,\u201d\n\nAdding to concerns about a crack down on civil liberties, the city\u2019s education bureau has also told schools they must provide details of how many students boycott classes, wear masks for political reasons, or take part in other protest activities, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nA Whatsapp message asked for the information by 11am on Tuesday, and also asked principals to take note of any \u201cspecial incidents\u201d, and record any students taking \u201cabnormal leave\u201d. Lawmaker and vice-president of the Professional Teachers\u2019 Union Ip Kin-yuen attacked the \u201ctotally unnecessary\u201d directive.\n\n\u201cWhat does the bureau really want to achieve by collecting such figures?\u201d he told the paper. \u201cAnd what if some of the non-cooperation movements happened solely outside school, should these events be reported as well?\u201d\n\nThere were also fresh attacks on media freedoms Sunday, with police beating up one reporter and forcing another to remove his gas mask, even though the law protects the right to be masked for professional reasons. Protesters also hit a journalist with a molotov cocktail when trying to target police.", "description": "Man and woman, arrested on Sunday, appeared in court after arrest for illegally covering their faces", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b047b6e56a0d6de345d076cc2c0509963dc3d497/0_148_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ab1ef173f548ebd2f2e9bd53581546e", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
