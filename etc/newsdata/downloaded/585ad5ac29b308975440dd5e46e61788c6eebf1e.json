I\u2019m always searching for new, more sustainable products which will make Christmas sparkle but won\u2019t end up spoiling our environment.\u201d", "description": "Waitrose and John Lewis will no longer sell plastic toys in Christmas crackers in an attempt to cut down on throwaway plastic.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson", "Stewart Jackson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/21/EHaSdm6XkAAowK7-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA1OSm6rjnnMUazHmmk33xQ5-3W5Bnhg7LKMtopwA9Ow.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
