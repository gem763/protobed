But today, the company told us that date is actually going to be a bit later, on October 28th. (It has also added the new date to its support document about the decision.) However, no matter when you post something to a group, it\u2019s still going to get deleted, as Yahoo is still removing all content hosted on Groups on December 14th.\n\nYahoo Groups once served as a place for discussions on just about any niche topic you could think of, a lot like Reddit does now. Once the old content is gone, though, all you\u2019ll be able to do on Yahoo Groups is browse the group\u2019s directory, request to be invited to one, and, if you\u2019re in a group, email that group.\n\nIn a statement, Yahoo suggested that most people just use Groups for emailing anyway:\n\nWe are tailoring Groups\u2019 features to match the preferences of our Groups members. Most of our members connect and share content primarily over email, so we believe this change will streamline and improve the Groups experience. Yahoo Groups will continue to provide a way for people to connect with their communities around shared interests, and we will continue to listen to feedback to ensure we keep our users happy.\n\nSo I guess it\u2019s not that surprising that Yahoo is keeping the messaging functionality around, if it\u2019s as widely used as Yahoo says it is.\n\nIf you really want to be able to post to your groups again, Yahoo says it\u2019s listening to feedback. But I still think all of Yahoo\u2019s actions mark the beginning of the end of Groups.", "description": "If you were saddened to hear that you will no longer be able to post to Yahoo Groups starting next week, cheer up \u2014 you\u2019ve now got an extra week to post.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hJru7AVKm3bkinDmiHXyt0rp_I=/0x50:675x403/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19296816/Screen_Shot_2019_10_17_at_12.33.20_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
