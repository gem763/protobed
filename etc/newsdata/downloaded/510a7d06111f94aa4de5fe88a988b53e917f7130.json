Although they had to go nearly a day past the roster deadline, they were able to recoup some value.\n\nAlonso could bolster the Saints\u2019 defense\n\nThe 29-year-old Alonso has been a big name since the Buffalo Bills selected him in the second round of the 2013 draft and he was named Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Pro Football Writers of America. Two years later, he was dealt straight up for the newest Kansas City Chief, LeSean McCoy.\n\nHe\u2019s put up massive numbers with 354 tackles over his three years in Miami \u2014 tied for fifth in the league over that stretch \u2014 and added three forced fumbles and interceptions. However, Alonso\u2019s value may be a bit overstated in those statistics, as illustrated by his zero Pro Bowl selections.\n\n[Watch live local and primetime NFL games free with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nAlonso has had particular trouble in coverage. Last season, quarterbacks completing almost 71 percent of passes thrown in his direction for 638 yards, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nHowever, he should still provide a sizable upgrade for the Saints, whose linebacking corps of AJ Klein, Demario Davis and Alex Anzalone was nothing to write home about. That\u2019s especially true considering how little they gave up.\n\nThe Dolphins continued their tear-down by dealing middle linebacker Kiko Alonso to the Saints.

Alonso was due $6.485 million this season with $2.55 million guaranteed, and he has a non-guaranteed $6.4 million cap hit next season. Biegel only has a $645,000 cap hit this season before becoming a restricted free agent.\n\nBiegel was a fourth-round pick of the Green Bay Packers in 2017 out of Wisconsin but was waived due to a foot injury after playing just nine games in his rookie season. He later signed with the Saints and was promoted from their practice squad and registered four tackles over 14 games.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance he could become a viable backup or special teams contributor, but the Dolphins are likely just content to have shed Alonso\u2019s salary.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Saints swapped third-year linebacker Vince Biegel for the veteran defender.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P1czAJJPiNHwJfqDMdKSog--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/T6fdhA.OttlMfkbdc2GjTg--~B/aD00NDgwO3c9NjcyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/6f2ea9e0-ccca-11e9-b77e-bb204dd8c40c"}
