No. But the facts are on our side.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulvaney\u2019s comments only fanned the flames of Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff saying they made things \u201cmuch, much worse.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Mulvaney linked the nearly $400 million in delayed military aid for Ukraine to the administration\u2019s desire for an investigation into the 2016 election and whether DNC servers were located in the foreign country.\n\nHe later walked back his remarks and said the news media misconstrued them to further their \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulvaney continued to walk back his comments on Sunday, saying there were three conditions related to the aid: looking into corruption in Ukraine, considering levels of aid from European countries, and participation in the ongoing Justice Department investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation.\n\n\u201cI never said there was a quid pro quo because there isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, arguing proof of that was in the fact that the aid eventually went to Ukraine.\n\nDespite the blowback from the press conference, Mr. Mulvaney said he \u201cabsolutely, positively\u201d has no plans to resign.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
