Even after some of the participants were told how well they scored on the test and how that compared to others\u2019 scores, they still assessed themselves more poorly than men.\n\nThis, the working paper\u2019s authors said, indicated that a gap in confidence alone did not explain the gap in self-promotion.\n\nOther additional tests the researchers performed also ruled out the possibility that men were more inclined to inflate a self-assessment because of incentives such as higher pay. Women were still more likely to rate themselves more poorly regardless of whether or not a potential employer was going to see their test results or their self-assessment.\n\nAlso see: Even Uber\u2019s got a gender gap \u2014 but how bad is it?\n\nAmong the remaining possible explanations, the researchers said that their findings could suggest that women believe that self-promotion is an inappropriate way to behave and/or that they are afraid of the possibility of backlash over being boastful about one\u2019s abilities.\n\nAt the same time, they also pointed to other research that showed that men are inclined to inflate their performance estimates, but that employers don\u2019t always take this into account.\n\nRegardless of the reasoning behind the gender gap in self-promotion, the researchers noted that it could have serious ripple effects in women\u2019s careers. As they note, people are often asked to rate their skills when applying to schools, interviewing for jobs or during performance reviews. As a result, they argue that many women\u2019s disinclination to assess themselves more favorably could play into other gender gaps, such as those around education and salary.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: How female investors can detect biased financial advice", "description": "\u2018When communicating to potential employers, women systematically provide less favorable assessments of their own past performance and potential future ability.\u2019", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS799_jobint_ZG_20191007143021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
