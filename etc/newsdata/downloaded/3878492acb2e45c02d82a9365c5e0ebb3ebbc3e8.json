President Ashraf Ghani, seeking a second five-year term, and Afghanistan's Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, are the frontrunners.\n\nJust two days after the election and before all votes had even arrived in Kabul for counting, Abdullah claimed victory in a move that international and local observers panned as premature.\n\nVote fraud\n\nVoting this year was supposed to be more secure than ever, with each voter verified through biometric machines to ensure no one could cast multiple ballots.\n\nOn October 12, his running mate Asadullah Saadati complained of \"systemic fraud\" organised by \"circles within the election commission and the palace\".\n\n190930105501022\n\nSaadati claimed the IEC was counting \"fraudulent\" and non-biometric votes.\n\nThe IEC has repeatedly said it would not count votes unless they had been verified biometrically.\n\nBut the use of biometric readers to prevent repeat voting complicated the process, partly because communication breakdowns prevented data from numerous readers being transmitted to the IEC on voting day.\n\nInstead, the machines had to be taken to the commission in Kabul to extract the data.\n\nHighlighting the challenges it faces, the commission said unidentified hackers unsuccessfully attempted to break into its servers.\n\nElection officials have called on candidates to show restraint and wait for the preliminary results in a bid to avoid a repeat of 2014 when that year's election was marred by duelling claims of victory and fraud by Abdullah and Ghani.\n\nThe IEC's initial timetable called for final results on November 7, after which a second electoral round would be held within two weeks if necessary.", "description": "About 2.7 million of Afghanistan's 9.6 million registered voters cast ballots in the September 28 first-round poll.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/ee4cc2b4a8a740bcbdc279cbd7a7914e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
