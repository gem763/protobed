The magazine Caixin said its index rose to 51.4 from 50.4.\n\nDemand for Chinese goods has been hurt by weakening domestic and global economic growth as well as U.S. tariff hikes in a fight over trade and technology.\n\nNegotiators are due to meet next week in Washington but there has been no sign of progress toward ending the dispute, which threatens to tip global economic growth into a recession.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect a meaningful breakthrough,\u201d said Citigroup economists in a report. \u201cEven if there is a ceasefire, the damage is already partly done because of elevated business uncertainties.\u201d\n\nWeak factory activity is adding to pressure on Chinese leaders to shore up economic growth. But they have resisted U.S. demands to roll back plans for state-led development of technology industries that Washington and other trading partners say violate Beijing\u2019s market-opening promises.\n\nThe Federation described September\u2019s data as a manufacturing rebound and said \u201cbusiness confidence shows signs of stabilizing.\u201d But forecasters warn China\u2019s economic activity is likely to decline in the longer term.\n\nA construction boom is winding down and Chinese regulators who want to reduce reliance on debt to propel growth look unlikely to ease lending controls. Beijing has avoided following the United States and Europe in cutting interest rates to spur activity.\n\nA separate index by the Federation of service industries declined to 53.8 from August\u2019s 53.7 as construction activity cooled.\n\n\u201cThis is unlikely to mark the start of a turnaround,\u201d said Capital Economics in a report. \u201cNot only is global demand set to weaken further, but the long-overdue pull-back in property construction is getting under way.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "China's factory activity improved in September ahead of talks with Washington aimed at ending a tariff war.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Mcdonald"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/china_manufacturing_19309_c0-174-5000-3089_s1770x1032.jpg?f7123897a4bdb536db30d2128a96154d9c730528", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
