That makes his critique of the wealth tax proposals from Warren and Sanders particularly relevant for Democrats.\n\nSummers said the data put forth by a pair of economists, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, to support the case for a wealth tax is \u201csubstantially misleading\u201d and \u201csubstantially inaccurate.\u201d\n\nHe argued on Thursday that it was likely that the wealthy could avoid much of the tax by spreading their wealth around to relatives and by donating it to organizations that would pursue their goals. This could increase their political influence because some of those organizations would likely lobby for policies their donors approve of, Summers said.\n\n\u201cIf you had a successful wealth tax that forced people to react the way they normally would by giving away their money to organizations that share their values and spent money in pursuit of their values, you would in all likelihood increase, rather than decrease, the influence of the views of the wealthy,\u201d Summers argued.\n\nWarren has proposed a 2 percent tax on wealth that exceeds $50 million, and 3 percent on the amount above $1 billion.\n\n\u201cThe arguments around political power have almost no validity,\u201d Summers said. \u201cThe truth is you can become one of the most powerful money people around the Democratic Party or the Republican Party for four or five million dollars a year. Nothing in this world is going to be able stop the wealthiest people in America from being able to come up with a vast multiple of that.\u201d", "description": "The former Obama and Clinton administration official says a wealth tax could backfire by increasing the influence of the very rich. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/12/larry-summers-former-treasury-secretary-speaking-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
