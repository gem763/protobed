Russian scientists were monitoring 13 birds in their routes from Siberia\n\nNovosibirsk ornithologist Elena Schneider is pictured with one of the birds taking part in the study\n\nShe stayed there almost four months and then flew by a circuitous route to land in Iran - and all the previous messages unloaded at once.\n\nBut the roaming charges were 'astronomical' - and the scientists were landed with a bill running into 'hundreds of pounds'.\n\nHad the GPS location messages been sent from Kazakhstan, the charges would have been tiny in comparison.\n\nA map of the routes taken by the birds was tracked over the time of the study. Min's journey is in red\n\nOn an earlier flight south from Russia, Min had ventured as far south as India (here she is pictured in India)\n\nIn Iran each text message cost around 60p.\n\nNovosibirsk ornithologist Elena Schneider said: 'She sent us all at once hundreds of expensive SMSs with her summer locations ... spending the entire collective phone budget for our eagles.'\n\nNow scientists from the Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre of Novosibirsk have started a campaign called 'Top up the eagle's mobile' to fund Min's expensive foreign travel.\n\n'We cannot let the eagles stop broadcasting - this is a very important study with interesting results,' said the scientist's statement.\n\nOn an earlier flight south from Russia, Min had ventured as far south as India.\n\nOther eagles had far more modest roaming charges.", "description": "One steppe eagle named Min flew first to Kazakhstan.
