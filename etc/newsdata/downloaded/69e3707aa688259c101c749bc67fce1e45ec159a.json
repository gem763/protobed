The utility's website said some Cape Breton communities may not have power restored until late Thursday night.\n\nOn Monday at 6:30 p.m. AT, there were 134,102 Nova Scotia Power customers without electricity. In other provinces, the number of customers without power at that time were:\n\n18,000 in Prince Edward Island.\n\n4,129 in New Brunswick.\n\nZero in Newfoundland.\n\nThe Nova Scotia government will focus its efforts on restoring power and cellphone services on Monday, said Premier Stephen McNeil.\n\nThe networks of several cell providers have been down or intermittently working following Dorian.\n\nHundreds of Canadian Armed Forces staff deployed Sunday continued to help crews clearing roads and removing downed trees Monday.\n\nCrews work to clean up fallen trees on Wellington Street in Halifax, two days after Hurricane Dorian walloped the Atlantic region. (Brett Ruskin/CBC)\n\nQuebec's Magdalen Islands were also hit by the storm, prompting worries about coastal erosion and road damage. On Sunday, almost all of the islands' residents were without power but Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec had restored power to most customers by Sunday evening.\n\nN.S. schools shut, drivers told to stay off roads\n\nEmergency management officials urged drivers to stay off the roads after snaking drive-thru lines at some of the few open fast-food restaurants impeded the path of emergency vehicles on Sunday.\n\nWith many traffic lights out at major intersections, police were also warning those who did have to drive to treat those lights as a four-way stop.\n\nIn Halifax, a parking ban is in effect on Tuesday along Beech Street. The ban will begin at 8 a.m. and will continue until the work is done \u2014 likely by Wednesday.\n\nThe municipality said the parking restriction is needed to facilitate tree removal. The ban along Beech will be from Chebucto Road to Oak Street and Quinpool Road to Geldert Street.\n\nMotorists if you find yourself at a failed traffic light, treat it as a four-way stop. The car that arrives first goes first. If two cars arrive at the same time, the car on the right goes first.

There are fears a \"staggering\" untold number of people died as thousands remain missing after the Category 5 hurricane pummelled the islands for two days.\n\nThe Outer Bank islands of North Carolina were also struck by Dorian, leaving four dead.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES", "description": "Two days after Hurricane Dorian swept\u00a0through Atlantic Canada, tens of thousands of people remain without power, leaving schools and some businesses closed Monday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275707.1568051874!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/preston-hurricane-dorian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
