Though it did not admit any wrongdoing, Deutsche Bank received criminal leniency in antitrust matters by agreeing to provide information such as electronic chats and other key evidences that can be used to prove other banks guilty.\n\nNotably, it had agreed to share information in May 2019. This made Deutsche Bank immune to prosecution and limited its exposure to financial penalty. However, the bank has been ordered to strengthen its antitrust compliance procedures and cooperate with investors.\n\nPer the filings, the banks are said to have underwritten $3.97 trillion, or 77.2%, of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds in the seven-year period, of which Deutsche Bank had the fourth largest market share, following Barclays, JPMorgan Chase and UBS Group.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan said that investors can sue Bank of America BAC, BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs GS and Morgan Stanley MS with antitrust claims.\n\nRakoff had said, \"The chats unmistakably show traders, acting on behalf of those defendants, agreeing to fix prices at a specific level before bringing the bonds to the secondary market.\"\n\nOur Take\n\nDeutsche Bank\u2019s decision to become the whistle blower kept its financials from taking a hard hit. Also, its restructuring efforts, including cost-saving measures, look encouraging. However, dismal revenue performance and horde of pending litigations remain concerns.\n\nShares of Deutsche Bank have lost 6.6% on the NYSE in the past six months compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 7.7%.\n\nThe stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nToday's Best Stocks from Zacks\n\n\n\nWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market-beating strategies?
