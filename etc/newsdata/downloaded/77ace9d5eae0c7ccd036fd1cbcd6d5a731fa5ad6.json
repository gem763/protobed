The U.S. coaches. National team director Tom Forster.\n\nThe biggest boost, though, came from someone thousands of miles away.\n\n\u201c(My Dad) FaceTimed me before the meet, and he was giving me a pep talk. He was super excited,\u201d Lee said Saturday night, after she finished second only to Simone Biles in qualifying at the world gymnastics championships.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing a lot better,\u201d she added. \u201cHe should also be going home maybe next week.\u201d\n\nBalance is as vital to gymnasts as the air they breathe. It\u2019s what allows them to do skills that defy physics and the ordinary person\u2019s imagination. It also can mean the difference between standing on a podium or sprawling across the floor.\n\nSunisa Lee (Photo: Laurence Griffiths, Getty Images)\n\nFor Lee, however, balance has taken on a different, weightier meaning in the last two months.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Lee\u2019s father, Houa John, fell off a ladder while he was helping a friend trim a tree. The accident injured his spinal cord, paralyzing him from the chest down initially. John Lee also broke his right wrist and fractured several ribs.\n\nThe accident occurred just before Sunisa Lee was to leave for the national championships in Kansas City. With her head in Kansas City and her heart back home in St. Paul, Minnesota, Lee went ahead and competed, finishing second to Biles in the all-around and establishing herself as a medal contender for next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nLee was eager to return home after nationals and spend time with her father and family. But with the world championships less than two months away, and knowing the pride and joy her gymnastics has brought her dad, there was no time to take off from training.\n\nSo she juggled her workouts with visits to her father, who remains at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, while also helping her mother care for her five siblings. There was school, too, since Lee just started her junior year in high school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard,\u201d Lee acknowledged. \u201cI\u2019ve had to sacrifice a lot of things so I can go see my Dad and getting training in as well and starting school and stuff like that. So it was hard to get the schedule worked out because there\u2019s been so many things happening.\u201d\n\nThe composure Lee has shown so far at worlds gives little hint of her personal turmoil or the growing expectations on her.\n\nDespite a fall on balance beam, she posted the second-highest individual score in qualifying, a 57.166. She and teammate Jade Carey tied for second on floor exercise, but Lee got the tiebreak \u2013 and the spot in the event final \u2013 because her execution score was four-tenths higher than Carey\u2019s.\n\nBut it was on uneven bars that Lee truly shined.\n\nShe appears almost weightless as she floats between bars, one skill flowing seamlessly into another. Most impressive was that she continuously alternated between the high and low bars, doing only one skill before switching to the other bar. Few gymnasts can manage that because it requires an inordinate amount of control and focus, and Lee\u2019s difficulty score of 6.4 reflects the challenge of doing all of these skills back to back.\n\nIf she loses her rhythm, there is no cover. If she gets off-balance, there is no time to reset.\n\nLee\u2019s score of 15.0 was third-highest on uneven bars. The gymnasts ahead of her, Nina Derwael and Daria Spiridonova, are both world champions on the event.\n\n\u201cPretty cool, huh?\u201d Forster said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fit in really well with the other girls,\u201d he added of Lee, the only world championships rookie on the U.S. team. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken her under their wing \u2026 (and) the morale with her on the team has been really up and positive. So it\u2019s been fun to see how she fits in.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, her gymnastics are beautiful.\u201d\n\nIt's not easy, balancing life's highest highs and lowest lows. But Lee and her family are managing.\n\nLee said her father remains paralyzed from the waist down, but \u201ceverything else is healing pretty well.\u201d He has already vowed that if Lee makes the Olympic team, he\u2019ll be there in Tokyo to cheer his daughter on.\n\nAfter everything that\u2019s happened these last two months, having John Lee deliver his pep talk in person would be the ultimate prize, more precious even than gold.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.", "description": "Sunisa Lee finished second to Simone Biles in all-around standings and qualified for uneven bars and floor exercise finals at World Gymnastics", "authors": ["Nancy Armour", "Published P.M.
