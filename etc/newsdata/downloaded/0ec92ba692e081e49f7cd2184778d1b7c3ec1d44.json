It was not an ambition of mine. I didn\u2019t think they would choose a female.\n\n\u201cWhen I got to Western Province I thought, \u2018OK, this is my platform\u2019. When I worked with the Currie Cup team and then finally with the Stormers, I thought this was it for me, because the Springboks would never appoint a female physiotherapist.\n\n\u201cSo, it was definitely the highlight in 2008 when I started with the Springboks.\u201d\n\nNaylor worked under coaches Peter de Villiers and then Heyneke Meyer, but took time out of the Bok environment after that to concentrate on her personal needs.\n\n\u201cMy contract had come to an end, and looking at the new contract, I thought maybe I should focus on my business. And most importantly, it was motherhood. My son (Cullin) was two years old at the end of the 2015 World Cup, and I thought, \u2018Let me try to be a full-time mom, work at my private practice\u2019,\u201d Naylor said.\n\n\u201cI think those two years were actually good for me. I feel I came back with a clear head, clear mind, clear vision of what I\u2019d like to change as a physiotherapist with the Springbok team. Sometimes it\u2019s not good to be in a position too long. You can also become complacent.\u201d\n\nShe has certainly had no time to be complacent with the 2019 Springboks at the World Cup.\n\nOne of three team physiotherapists - Vivian Verwant and Tanushree Pillay are the others - she commands the respect of all the players despite being shorter than scrumhalf Faf de Klerk.\n\n\u201cWe have a joke at the moment in the physio department it's like a 7-11 - we open at 07:00 and close at 23:00! It\u2019s long hours, you put in everything. With the World Cup, I think there is just a lot more at stake,\u201d Naylor said.\n\n\u201cAnd yes, my day does start very early with my own training - I like to do my own running, or go to gym at six o\u2019clock, and then seven o\u2019clock we usually see guys if we are starting early.\n\n\u201cYou do have some off time in the day when the guys are in technical sessions, so you will have an hour here or 45 minutes there, just to breathe a bit. Our hours then commence at night, after dinner, training and recovery, where I will be in the physio room.\u201d\n\nNaylor feels there is a \u201ccalm focus\u201d within the Bok squad as they get ready to take on Wales and hopes it will be third time lucky for her after being with the team that failed in the quarter-finals in 2011 and then semi-finals four years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an absolute honour and privilege to be part of this brand - it\u2019s something bigger than you, and it is big for our country,\u201d said Naylor.\n\n\u201cIt has got so many symbolic meanings for our country, so it is special to be part of it. And if you are not part of it, you feel it. When I took a break for two years, thinking I\u2019m going to retire, you come back and think \u2018Did I make the right choice to come back?\u2019, which was last year.\n\n\u201cAnd it was the best decision I could\u2019ve made, because I feel this is where I want to be ... this is where I feel I belong.\u201d", "description": "Among those participating at a third Rugby World Cup in Japan is a woman who never dared dream that she might one day have a chance of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9516/e46fddc458774a7bb6442eb71f4d6875.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
