Legitimate defense is a sacred right,\" Fethiere told local media, adding he was unaware a journalist had been injured.\n\nThe photographer working for The Associated Press suffered a minor injury to his jaw from a bullet shard, according to an AFP journalist who met with him.\n\nThe photographer, who asked not to be named, appeared lucid but in shock and was hospitalized.\n\nPrime Minister Fritz-William Michel, who was appointed at the end of July, was to appear together with his ministers in the Senate for the ratification of his general policy, an essential step to installing his government.\n\nThe Senate session was postponed indefinitely after the Monday morning incident.\n\nHaitian President Jovenel Moise canceled his trip to New York, where he was to participate in the United Nations General Assembly, according to a statement released Monday evening.\n\nHe was supposed to leave Sunday but had previously said his departure was postponed pending the installation of the government.\n\nEarlier Monday, several hundred protesters flooded the streets of the capital to express their frustration with Moise, setting up barricades along their path.\n\n\"We don't want to hear about ratifying the prime minister.
