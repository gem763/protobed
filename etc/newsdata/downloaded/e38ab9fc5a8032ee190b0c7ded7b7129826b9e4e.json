Despite soaring levels of prescriptions, the prevalence of depression among over 65s only fell from 7.9 per cent to 6.8 per cent.\n\nThe number of care home residents taking antidepressants quadrupled over the two decades, from 7 per cent to 29 per cent. Yet the proportion of people in care homes with depression remained one in ten, the University of East Anglia research found.\n\nExperts warned that many patients end up hooked on the pills because they are worried about withdrawal symptoms and their GPs fail to review their medication.\n\nThere is growing acceptance that antidepressants are overprescribed. The Daily Mail has been campaigning for greater recognition of the prescription drugs addiction crisis since March 2017.\n\nThe major British study also reveals that the majority of over-65s who take the drugs do not have depressive symptoms (file image)\n\nProfessor Tony Arthur, author of today's study published in the British Journal Of Psychiatry, said that elderly patients must be given more help to get off the drugs.\n\n'You would hope that with a dramatic increase in the prescription of antidepressants, the rate of people suffering from depression would decrease.\n\nBut we found little change,' he said. 'This could be due to improved recognition and treatment of depression, overprescribing, or use of antidepressants for other conditions.\n\nWe need to be vigilant about the regular review of people taking antidepressants. Patients who have been on antidepressants for a long time should see their GP to discuss de-prescribing.'\n\nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'This increase could indicate a greater awareness and acceptance of mental health conditions, and show more people over 65 are seeking help \u2013 which are both encouraging.'", "description": "Experts warned that many patients end up hooked on the pills because they are worried about withdrawal symptoms and their GPs fail to review their medication.", "authors": ["Eleanor Hayward For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/23/19374374-0-image-a-15_1570402442817.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
