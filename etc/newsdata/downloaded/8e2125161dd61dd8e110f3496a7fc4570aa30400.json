He will replace the current mayor of Montgomery, Todd Strange, who chose not to run for reelection after a decade in office, the Montgomery Advertiser reported. Reed will be sworn in Nov. 12.\n\n\"This election has never been about me,\" Reed said in his victory speech. \"This election has never been about just my ideas. It's been about all the hopes and dreams we have as individuals and collectively in this city.\"\n\n\"Montgomery is a city with limitless potential, a city that has no limits outside of our imagination,\" Reed continued. \"The only thing that can hold us back is our fears. When we come together there's nothing that we can't accomplish. \"\n\nIn his concession speech, Woods said: \u201cWe\u2019re just going to go forward and try to support Steven Reed as mayor. And I just want to encourage everyone to try to continue to work together to bring Montgomery as a unified city. A unified Montgomery is a lot stronger than a divided Montgomery.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nMontgomery has historically been a hotbed for racial tension. Southern delegates gathered in Montgomery in 1861 to vote to form the Confederacy. The city is also home to the church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the Montgomery bus boycott, in which Rosa Parks became a symbol of the 1960s civil rights movement.\n\nReed was endorsed by Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox, Montgomery's WSFA-TV reported. His father, Joe Reed, is the longtime leader of the black caucus of the Alabama Democratic Party.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Alabama\u2019s capital of Montgomery, which is known as the birthplace of the civil rights movement, elected an African American mayor for the first time Tuesday in the city\u2019s nearly 200-year history, according to reports.", "authors": ["Danielle Wallace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/steven-reed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
