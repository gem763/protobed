Franklin Graham Laments Ron Reagan Jr. Atheism Ad", "language": "en", "text": "Rev. Franklin Graham expressed disappointment Thursday that President Ronald Reagan\u2019s son boasted about his atheism in a recent ad for the Freedom from Religion Foundation (FFRF).\n\n\u201cI was saddened to see the news that President Ronald Reagan\u2019s son, Ron, Jr., is a self-proclaimed atheist, and proud of it,\u201d Rev. Graham wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday.\n\nHe continued:\n\nHis father was certainly quite different\u2014President Reagan had a deep faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ. Ron, Jr., was in a television advertisement to raise money for the Freedom From Religion Foundation that aired during the Democratic debate this week and got a lot of attention. He boasted in the ad that he was a \u201clifelong atheist, not afraid of burning in hell.\u201d Wow. It is, of course, his choice to believe or not to believe in God and His plan of salvation through Christ. But whether an individual \u201cbelieves\u201d in God, heaven, or hell doesn\u2019t change the reality. The Bible tells us that hell is a place of torment, fire, and separation from God\u2014 and hell awaits those who do not repent of their sin and put their faith and trust in Christ. Let\u2019s pray that Ron will know the saving love of Jesus Christ and turn to Him before it is too late.\n\nThe ad, which aired during the Democrat debate in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday night, sought to raise money for the FFRF and became the top trending search on Google during the CNN event.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Ron Reagan, an unabashed atheist, and I\u2019m alarmed by the intrusion of religion into our secular government,\u201d Reagan stated in the commercial.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you to support the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the nation\u2019s largest and most effective association of atheists and agnostics, working to keep state and church separate, just like our Founding Fathers intended. Please support the Freedom From Religion Foundation. Ron Reagan, lifelong atheist, not afraid of burning in hell.\n\nHowever, critics were quick to voice their opinions of the ad\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cThis is the left. They booed God at their convention,\u201d tweeted Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk:\n\nThis is the left They booed God at their convention They want to defund churches that don't support their progressive views And this is the ad that gets the prime spot at their debates\u2014\"I'm not afraid of burning in hell\" RT if you're disgusted with this Godless party pic.twitter.com/ycyprA0JVv \u2014 Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 16, 2019\n\nPrior to the debate on Tuesday, the FFRF stated that the \u201ciconic\u201d ad had been censored from the ABC network when it tried to air the commercial during the Democrat debate on September 12.\n\nThe Foundation said:\n\nThe 30-second spot (the first freethinking ad believed to have ever run during a presidential primary debate) will be shown twice during the Oct. 15 debate itself, and also during the primary debate pre-show and post-show. The ad will also air Wednesday on \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d (4-5 p.m. Eastern), \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d (5-7 p.m.) and \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d (8-9 p.m.).\n\nRadio host Rush Limbaugh called it \u201cone of the most perfect ad placements in the history of advertising,\u201d adding that \u201cyou want to reach a bunch of people that don\u2019t like God, don\u2019t like religion, and have no fear of hell because they don\u2019t think it exists and so they don\u2019t mind burning there? Run this ad in a Democrat debate!\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Franklin Graham expressed sadness that President Reagan's son boasted about his atheism in an ad for the Freedom from Religion Foundation.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Franklin-Graham-head-bowed-eyes-closed-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
