Door No. 2: A quick login accompanied by a lifetime supply of intrusive ads. Door No. 3? A more private way in. Just be warned\u2014for now, Door No. 3 is hard to find.\n\nI\u2019m talking, of course, about the sign-in screen on all favorite apps. You can either log in with username and password, or choose a gateway manned by Facebook , Google or\u2014soon, in some cases\u2014 Apple . In an attempt to unseat its ad-powered competitors, Apple is offering a privacy-focused app sign-in service with the arrival on Thursday of iOS 13.\n\n\u2018Sign in with Apple\u2019 is available alongside Facebook's sign-in option in the family-oriented photo-sharing app Lifecake.

Heck, there was a time when I didn\u2019t know that myself. When I first signed up for Spotify using Facebook, I unknowingly opted to share my email address, my friends list and my birthday. That\u2019s a lot of info, just to listen to my Acoustic Covers playlist.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has engineered its button so you share less with app makers. You can even create a disposable email address.\n\nAfter testing out Apple\u2019s new feature in some early supported apps, I can tell you it\u2019s the best option\u2014if any of the apps you use actually add it. Apple is coming from far behind, and facing some pushback from app makers that rely on those incumbents not just for marketing, but for security.\n\nUntil more companies adopt this, Apple\u2019s greatest contribution here is to make us question why companies provide these \u201csingle sign-on\u201d services, and what we get in return.\n\n(Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.)\n\nHow do they work, anyway?\n\nWhen choosing a door into an app, you either take responsibility for your own username and password, or trust one of the big-tech companies to handle the authenticating for you. If you choose the latter, you just log in with your Facebook/Google/Apple credentials and they confirm you are who you say you are\u2014often using two-factor authentication, where you scan your fingerprint or face, or enter a secret code sent via text or app. Then they give the app a thumbs-up, without sharing your password. (See the video for a more colorful explanation\u2014which also involves doors.)\n\nWhy is this better than a new username and password?\n\nIf you use strong, unique passwords and store them in a password manager, as I\u2019ve long suggested, you might be fine creating a fresh account for every app and service. Even then, security experts make a case for logging in via a big tech company.\n\nFor one thing, they have larger divisions dedicated to security. They can troubleshoot issues that smaller companies might not be able to tackle. Also, smaller companies can\u2019t always implement two-factor authentication, a baseline requirement these days.\n\nWhen you sign in on an app with Facebook, the app will often ask for more than just your name and email address. Sharing in Facebook is on by default; you have to tap to disable other permissions.

At a minimum, Google shares your profile photo, name and email address with the app makers using its single sign-on options. Facebook requires you share to your profile photo and full name.\n\nApps that use Facebook often ask for even more. Take Tinder. Log in and it asks for access to your Facebook friends list, birthday, photos, page likes and email address. There\u2019s a panel to adjust the sharing options, but all of the permissions are turned on by default.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for Google and Facebook?\n\nMark Risher, senior director of product management for Google Account, says the company provides this service to help secure the Internet. (It certainly also makes it easier for Google to provide its other services, from Gmail to search.) Mr. Risher says the company doesn\u2019t use this collected information to target ads.\n\nBut Facebook does. Facebook Login \u201callows businesses to create custom audiences of people who have visited their properties. That way a business can show ads to people on Facebook who have visited their sites and apps,\u201d a Facebook spokesman said.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t mind Facebook profiting off of your internet behavior, the company has a history of misusing data and leaking it to outsiders, in the case of Cambridge Analytica and in many others. (The company updated its data policies last year in response.) And then there are the breaches: In 2018, a Facebook data breach was tied to its single sign-on tool.\n\nDuring Apple's sign-in process, you can change your name and opt to hide your email from the app maker. Photo: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal\n\nHow does Apple\u2019s option work?\n\nLike Google, Apple shares your name and email address with the app, but it gives you an option to hide your email or change your name: It will share an anonymized email address and then forward any email from the app maker to your real address. The Bird bike and scooter app thinks my email is 636r6zf9kz@privaterelay.appleid.com ... and my name is Scooby Doo.\n\nDevelopers can implement the Sign in with Apple button on Mac apps and on websites as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has taken on the superhero role of big tech\u2019s privacy protector, this is less altruism, more shrewd marketing: The more you trust Apple, the more you keep buying its devices and using its apps\u2014many of which now charge monthly subscriptions.\n\nWhich apps are offering this?\n\nThe number of popular apps using this new Apple tool so far is small. I tested the feature in Bird and the family photo journal app Lifecake. Kayak, Nike , Instacart and LoseIt are also among the apps Apple confirmed to be implementing Sign in with Apple this fall.\n\nWhen I contacted other top iOS app makers\u2014those which use Facebook and/or Google sign-in buttons\u2014some including Postmates, Pinterest and Venmo said they had no plans yet to add the feature. Others, including TikTok, Evernote and Todoist, said it was on the road map. Spotify declined to comment.\n\nApple\u2019s newest developer guidelines require any apps that offer a social sign-in to also implement Sign in with Apple. As of last week, new apps submitted must offer the button. Existing apps and app updates must follow by April 2020.\n\nWhat are the downsides of Apple\u2019s option?\n\nIn cases like Tinder\u2019s, the anonymity benefit to one user can be a problem for other users. \u201cVerifying a user\u2019s identity using their login credentials helps us prevent those who have been removed for their conduct from accessing our service,\u201d a Tinder spokesman said, adding that the company looks forward to hearing more from Apple on this.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you prefer signing in to apps with a username and password, or letting Facebook or Google sign in for you? Why? Join the conversation below.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that the iPhone isn\u2019t immune to security vulnerabilities. Plus, who could forget the iCloud celebrity hacks of 2014? Apple does require two-factor for Sign in with Apple.\n\nAnd finally, even when your favorite app does adopt it, you might have to create a new account to use it.\n\nSo what should I do?\n\nI wish more app makers would run\u2014not walk\u2014to implement Apple\u2019s option as an alternative to Facebook and Google. For now, just be on the lookout for it. If you don\u2019t see it, I recommend Google as the quickest, safest alternative. Just do yourself a favor, and choose your doors wisely.\n\n\u2014For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.\n\nWrite to Joanna Stern at joanna.stern@wsj.com", "description": "Apple\u2019s new password killer, \u201cSign in with Apple,\u201d coming in iOS 13, lets you log into third-party apps using your Apple ID and get major privacy benefits\u2014but only if the biggest apps adopt it.", "authors": ["Joanna Stern", "Joanna.Stern Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107007/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
