Jason Scott\n\nThe tiring detour through the beams of light can put birds at risk of starvation or injury to populations already threatened by light pollution, collisions with buildings, habitat destruction and climate change.\n\nSince 2005, bird scientists, ecological volunteers and the memorial\u2019s sponsors have worked together to try to reduce the harm \u2014 a collaboration now yielding new scientific insights and increasing support for protecting birds in New York and other cities.\n\nAround sunset, as the beams become visible, volunteers and scientists \u2014 along with September 11 emergency responders, survivors and relatives of victims who are invited to view the tribute \u2014 gather on the roof of a parking garage near the base of lights close to the World Trade Center site.\n\nWith the help of binoculars, radar and the naked eye, the professional scientists and the volunteers count the trapped birds, which often include small songbirds like Canada and yellow warblers and American redstarts.\n\nNighthawks and bats come too, to prey on insects, and peregrine falcons show up to feed on the smaller birds. When the number of trapped birds reaches around 1,000, the lights are switched off for 20 minutes to let the birds disperse.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

One study conducted on seven anniversary nights between 2008 to 2016 concluded that the lights affected the migrations of 1.1 million birds.\n\nCollisions with buildings, especially ones with transparent or reflective windows, kill 600 million birds a year across the country, and as many as 230,000 in New York City, according to NYC Audubon.\n\nThe problem at the tribute, Ms Elbin said, is that the immense lights can leave birds exhausted and disoriented, making them more vulnerable as they continue their migration.\n\n\u201cLight lures them in, and glass finishes them off,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother risk is that by flying in the lights, birds could use up too much of the fat they store for energy for migration, she said.\n\n\u201cThey only have enough to get where they need to go; the fatter you are the more energy it takes to fly, so it\u2019s a fine balance,\u201d she said.\n\nThe September 11 bird-watching ritual has attracted a following; there are waiting lists to join the 20 volunteers each year.\n\nIt has also bolstered a growing movement called \u201ccommunity science,\u201d in which members of the public help professional scientists collect data, increasing the scale of research and helping connect volunteers to their environment and to science.\n\nThe radar studies are now being used by scientists and advocates to raise awareness about the ecological impact of light pollution in cities across the globe.\n\nThe monitoring is being expanded to look at the effect of the lights on insects, which also suffer migration disruption and can burn to death.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New York City Council is holding a committee meeting on a bill to require new or renovated buildings to use more bird-friendly glass. A similar campaign is underway in Chicago.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Every year on September 11, two soaring beams of light turn on over Lower Manhattan in a glowing tribute to those killed 18 years ago.
