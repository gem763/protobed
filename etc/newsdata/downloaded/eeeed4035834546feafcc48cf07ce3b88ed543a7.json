with agonising stomach cramps after he contracted salmonella from a frozen meal.\n\nCorey Monaghan, 23, was taken to Flinders Medical Centre in southern Adelaide early on Saturday morning after he suffered through two nights of diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nMr Monaghan went days without knowing what was wrong with him, and had to be given morphine as the pain in his gut was so severe.\n\nScroll

nights of diarrhea and vomiting\n\nCorey Monaghan (pictured) was rushed to Flinders Medical Centre, south of Adelaide early Saturday morning after he suffered two nights of diarrhea and vomiting\n\nFollowing a national recall alert, it was found that he was among 15 people in Australia who became sick after eating Core Powerfoods frozen meals.\n\nAccording to Nine News, it wasn't until his mother read an article on Monday about the recall that they put the pieces together and he was diagnosed with salmonella.\n\n'I've never been this sick in my life... never,' he said.\n\nMr Monaghan's girlfriend of five years, Brooklyn Kuhl, said they originally thought he may have been suffering from a gastro bug.\n\n'The worst of it was on Sunday night, he was in a lot of pain and had stomach cramps,' Ms Kuhl told The Advertiser.\n\nThe 22-year-old said her boyfriend is making progress in his recovery but still does not have much energy.\n\nMr Monaghan loves the Core Powerfoods meals and has eaten them before, but this was the first time he has ever gotten sick after consuming them.\n\nWhile he is getting better, the 23-year-old is expected to stay in hospital until Saturday.\n\nHe no longer wants to eat the frozen meals and Ms Kuhl said they would be throwing the rest of them out.\n\nSA Health director for Food and Controlled Drugs, Doctor Fay Jenkins, said the type of Salmonella is unusual and poses serious health risks.\n\nMr Monaghan loves the Core Powerfoods meals and has eaten them before, but this was the first time he has ever gotten sick after consuming them\n\nBrooklyn Kuhl said they originally thought he may have been suffering from a gastro bug\n\n'While this particular type of salmonella is unusual, any kind of salmonella poses serious health risks and symptoms of infection can begin anywhere between six and 72 hours after exposure and last for three to seven days,' Dr Jenkins said on Monday.\n\nThe Core Powerfoods products being recalled are the 310 or 350g varieties of: Going Nuts, Deep South Chilli, Muay Thai Meatballs, Holy Meatballs, Naked Chicken, Seismic Chicken, Old School, and Smokey Mountain Meatballs.\n\nSpokesman Jeremy McAnulty warned that people may have to be hospitalised to manage dehydration from severe salmonellosis.\n\nYoung babies, elderly people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, he said in a release on NSW Health's website.\n\n'Salmonellosis symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,' Dr McAnulty said.\n\n'Symptoms... usually last for four to seven days, but can continue for much longer.\n\nIt was found that he was among 15 people in Australia who became sick after eating Core Powerfoods frozen meals\n\n'It is important that people do not prepare food for others while they are unwell with salmonellosis and as a precaution for 48 hours after symptoms have passed.'\n\nDr McAnulty said thorough cooking kills salmonella bacteria, but microwaves can heat food unevenly if not used correctly.\n\n'The longer food is left at room temperature the more the Salmonella bacteria will multiply,' he said.\n\n'Refrigerated food should be kept at less than 5C and hot food should be kept above 60C.'\n\nThe affected products have date markings of Best Before 26/08/2020 to 4/10/2020 inclusive.\n\nThe products have been on sale at Coles Supermarkets nationally and IGA supermarkets in New South Wales, ACT, Victoria and the Northern Territory.\n\nCore Powerfoods director Jake Richardson apologised for the salmonella outbreak.\n\n'Our first priority is the health of our customers,' he said.\n\n'As soon was we were informed of a potential link with our product we have acted immediately to conduct a full, voluntary recall.\n\n'We are assisting authorities as they attempt to confirm the source of this outbreak and have placed a temporary halt on production.'", "description": "Corey Monaghan, 23, was taken to Flinders Medical Centre
