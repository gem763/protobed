Zachary Terwilliger said in a statement.\n\nProsecutors said court documents showed Rogers operated multiple PACs from August 2012 through last year. Among them, prosecutors said, were the Conservative Strike Force, Conservative Majority Fund and Tea Party Majority Fund.\n\nIn one instance, prosecutors said Rogers, working with an email vendor, represented through Conservative Strike Force in and around 2013 that contributions would support campaigns for candidates for attorney general and governor in Virginia.\n\n[FBI searches Republican political consulting firm in Annapolis]\n\nAmong other things, the prosecutors said, Rogers indicated that the contributions would be used for get-out-the-vote efforts and for attorneys to ensure election integrity. He later said that donations would go to support military veterans, according to prosecutors.\n\nBut prosecutors said Rogers spent nearly all of the raised money to benefit himself, his associates and his PACs. They said most of the donor money went toward soliciting more donations.\n\nKen Cuccinelli II, a Republican who ran for Virginia governor in 2013, sued the Conservative Strike Force and Annapolis political consulting firm Strategic Consulting Group in 2014, alleging they raised almost $2.2 million to support his gubernatorial campaign but steered little money to him.\n\nThe Conservative Strike Force agreed in 2015 to pay Cuccinelli $85,000 to settle the lawsuit. The Strategic Campaign Group said it would turn over donor information.\n\nCuccinelli now serves as director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nIn 2017, federal authorities searched the offices of Strategic Campaign Group, The Washington Post reported at the time.\n\nAs part of Tuesday\u2019s plea, prosecutors said Rogers agreed to pay $491,299 in restitution to victims of the fraud scheme, as well as a forfeiture judgment of $208,954.\n\nHe is scheduled to be sentenced in January.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Prosecutors say the money was raised with the intent of benefiting a PAC operator.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
