AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"I was sorry for Thanasi on the second day,\" said Nadal. \"It's honestly tough for a player like him, that he's very young and he already had plenty of issues, physical issues. Tough, and I hope it's not too bad.\n\n\"But for me personally, in some way, I will prefer to play the match. In some way it is true that you save energy. So you never know what's the best thing.\n\n\"I had the first three months of the season too many issues again. But then it's true that since Barcelona, things have been improving.\n\n\"I was able to fix a little bit the body and play more or less with freedom of movements.\n\n\"That's given me the chance to compete at the highest level again. And most important thing, enjoy the sport. That's the main thing in this stage of my career more than anything else.\n\n\"So here I am to try my best and I'm going to put my 100 per cent to try to be ready for the next round.\"\n\nNadal will meet 2014 champion Marin Cilic in the last 16.\n\nCroatian Cilic won the battle of the big servers, knocking out American 14th seed John Isner in four sets.\n\nMeanwhile, Nick Kyrgios' eventful run in New York was ended by Andrey Rublev.\n\nIn the space of a few days, Kyrgios prompted an ATP investigation for his comments about the governing body, got into hot water about a motto on his collar and criticised a TV commentator - only to be interviewed by him hours later before Saturday night's match.\n\nBut the sideshow is over after Russian Rublev took two tie-breaks and won 6-3 in the third.\n\nSixth seed Alexander Zverev of Germany dropped the first set to Aljaz Bedene of Slovenia, but made it through in four.", "description": "Rafael Nadal moved ominously into the last 16 at the US Open with a straight-sets win over Chung Hyeon.
