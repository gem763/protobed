He will fly to Brussels to meet with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to discuss transatlantic security issues and U.S. goals for the upcoming meeting of NATO leaders.\n\nTrump's withdrawal effectively abandoned Kurdish forces once allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nSmoke rises from the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain on Wednesday, the eighth day of Turkey's military operation against Kurdish forces there\n\nThe vice president heads a U.S. delegation that includes Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O'Brien\n\nThe trip comes at a perhaps the darkest moment for the modern U.S.-Turkey relationship and a time of trial for Trump and his Republican Party allies. Trump's failure to deter Erdogan's assault on the Kurds, and his subsequent embrace of Turkish talking points about the former U.S. allies, sparked bipartisan outrage and calls for swift punishment for the NATO ally.\n\nEven as he advertised the Pence trip to protect the Kurds, Trump suggested Wednesday that a Kurdish group was a greater terror threat than the Islamic State, and he welcomed the efforts of Russia and the Assad government to fill the void left by the U.S.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the U.S. relationship with the Kurds 'a great alliance.'\n\n'I'm sorry that we are where we are. I hope the Vice President and the secretary of state can somehow repair the damage,' McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nA former Pence adviser noted that Trump has tasked Pence with sensitive diplomatic missions before, including ratcheting up pressure on North Korea around the Winter Olympics last year, which helped pave the way for talks between Trump and Kim Jong Un.\n\nSyrian government forces raise a national flag and an image of President Bashar al-Assad at Tabqa air base in Syria's Raqqa region in northern Syria on Wednesday. Assad's troops have returned to key northern areas for the first time in years in a deal with the Kurds, seeking protection after Trump ordered the withdrawal of some 1,000 US troops\n\nAn October 9 letter from President Trump to Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan warning him about Turkish military policy and the Kurdish people in Syria\n\nThe White House said Pence will meet Thursday with Erdogan to deliver the message that the U.S. will 'maintain punishing economic sanctions on Turkey until a resolution is reached.'\n\nBut Erdogan has publicly stated that he will be undeterred by the sanctions and resisted calls for a cease-fire Wednesday, saying the fighting would end only if Kurdish fighters abandoned their weapons and retreated from positions near the Turkish border.\n\nBut even if Pence can convince Turkey to agree to a cease-fire, which will almost certainly require more leverage than the economic sanctions imposed Monday on Turkey, experts warn it will not erase the signal Trump's action sent to American allies across the globe or the opening already exploited by Russia in the region.\n\n'Deterring an action that hasn't yet been taken is almost always easier than trying to coerce someone to reverse an action that they've already committed blood, treasure and honor to,' said John Hannah, former national security adviser for former Vice President Dick Cheney and a senior counselor for Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nPence will confront doubts about American credibility and his own, as an emissary of an inconsistent president\n\nAs Trump's comments about the crisis drew condemnation on Capitol Hill, two senior administration officials raised alarm that the hastily organized trip lacked achievable goals, with one calling it 'half-baked' and undermined by Trump even before it began. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.\n\nAykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish Parliament and a senior fellow at FDD, said that Pence may succeed with Erdogan where Trump failed because he is viewed as a 'tough negotiator' in contrast to Trump, who has placed value on international 'friendships' with leaders with authoritarian tendencies.\n\n'Erdogan only respects and responds favorably to leaders who he believes are not pushovers,' he said, noting that Pence is viewed in Turkey as the chief U.S. advocate for the economic sanctions that led Erdogan to free American pastor Andrew Brunson in 2018.\n\nErdogan faces global condemnation for the invasion but also sees renewed nationalistic fervor at home, and any pathway to de-escalation, Erdemir said, would likely need to delicately avoid embarrassing Erdogan at home.\n\nPence, he added, is 'more about action than talk, and in that way he's a good match for Erdogan in these conditions.'", "description": "Pence was scheduled to leave for Turkey Wednesday evening, just hours after Trump minimized the crisis he sent his aides on an emergency mission to douse.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/05/19820488-0-image-a-41_1571287222597.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
