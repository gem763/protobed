Didn\u2019t come even remotely close, but the nice man with the taser escorted me to the ground.\u2019\n\nWhile he may not be able to take the role of Iron Man away from Robert Downey Jr., it looks likely that Deadpool may cross over into the Marvel Cinematic Universe pretty soon.\n\nFollowing Disney\u2019s acquisition of Fox, which previously distributed the Deadpool movies, it\u2019s likely the antihero will become a Disney/Marvel character, though plans have yet to be confirmed.\n\nAside from joking about auditioning to be Iron Man, Ryan remained tight-lipped on whether he was at the Marvel Studios for a meeting about Deadpool or another possible project.\n\nRyan had fans speculating after revealing he was at the Marvel Studios for a meeting (Picture: Twitter)\n\nDeadpool director Paul Wernick told Entertainment Weekly: \u2018We\u2019re always in touch with Ryan. We\u2019ve got several projects with him in addition to the Deadpool universe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think the party line and truth is we\u2019re all still figuring it out. Marvel has promised to continue to let us play in the R-rated Deadpool universe, and the hope is that they will also let us veer into the MCU a little bit as well and play in that sandbox.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018Our feeling and Ryan\u2019s feeling is that it\u2019s got to be the right idea, it\u2019s got to be great\u2026 I think once we collectively agree what idea that great idea is we\u2019ll be off to the races.\n\n\u2018Ryan\u2019s super-busy, we\u2019ve got a lot of projects lined up, but we wake up thinking about Deadpool, and we go to sleep thinking about Deadpool.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
