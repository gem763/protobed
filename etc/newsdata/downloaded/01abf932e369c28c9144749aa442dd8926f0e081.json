Led by Gothenburg\u2019s Sahlgrenska university hospital, the Swedish post-term induction study (Swepis) set out to survey 10,000 women at 14 hospitals.\n\nWomen in their 40th week of pregnancy were invited to join the study and divided randomly into two groups, with labour induced at the beginning of either week 42 or week 43, unless it occurred spontaneously.\n\nWhen abruptly halted in October 2018, the study had involved only a quarter of the target number of expectant mothers. But the six deaths were already judged to indicate a significantly increased risk for women induced at the start of week 43. No infants died in the group whose pregnancies were ended a week earlier.\n\nAlthough concern about the findings was first reported by Swedish television in the summer, researchers have declined to make the results public, or to speak to the media, until their work is published in a medical journal. But details are contained in a doctoral thesis by one of the researchers, recently made available on Gothenburg University\u2019s website.\n\nThe immediate consequences of the study \u201cmay be a change of the clinical guidelines to recommend induction of labour no later than at 41+0 gestational weeks\u201d, its author concludes.\n\nSahlgrenska hospital announced on Thursday that it would change its pregnancy management policies based on the results of Swepis trial.\n\n\u201cWe have awaited the scientific analysis showing that it is really true that there is a greater risk of waiting two weeks beyond term,\u201d the head of childbirth operations at the hospital told Swedish television.\n\n\u201cNow we plan, as soon as we possibly can, to offer induction in week 41 to all women who go over term.\u201d\n\nAnother of the hospitals involved in the study has already changed its policy after two infant deaths there. Other Swedish hospitals say they will follow suit.\n\nSweden\u2019s national charity supporting parents who have lost an infant called for an immediate change to hospital policies across the country.\n\n\u201cSince they terminated the study due to ethical reasons, it is highly unethical not to go public with those results,\u201d said Malin Asp, chair of Sp\u00e4dbarnsfonden, the Swedish Infant Death Foundation. \u201cThere is potential to save babies\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nSara Kenyon, professor in evidence-based maternity care at Birmingham University, said the death of six babies in the later pregnancy group represented an important clinical and statistical difference between the two groups of women. The outcome of the study \u201cis important for practice\u201d, she said.\n\nIn the UK, the NHS offers to induce all women who have not gone into labour by 42 weeks. As many as one in five women give birth after 41 weeks in the absence of medical intervention.\n\nProfessor Robert M Silver, co-author of US research last year suggesting that it is appropriate to offer women the option to be induced at the beginning of week 40, told the Guardian that the Swedish study appears to be \u201cfully in line\u201d with available research.\n\n\u201cIf you continue a healthy pregnancy after week 40 you still have a low risk of complications,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the more babies that are delivered, the fewer that are stillborn. Earlier induction also reduces the risk of caesarean section.\u201d\n\nJan Jaap Erwich, professor of obstetrics at Groningen university, in the Netherlands, said the Swepis research could be the final attempt to determine the exact effects of late-term pregnancy: \u201cIt is now likely we will never know the precise risks, because nobody will do a study with so many women again.\u201d", "description": "Swedish researchers say proceeding with induction study would have been unethical", "authors": ["David Crouch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7e29895b782bdd1e3fe575a4a503faf3cb9fd9/0_140_4572_2742/master/4572.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4841e631a52d4eeca3ef5487b581a696", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
