But both the whistleblower and Trump allude to his involvement. And, in the meantime, his Justice Department has both hindered the complaint\u2019s progress and declined to formally investigate it.\n\nAD\n\nThe whistleblower complaint released Thursday says that \u201cAttorney General Barr appears to be involved as well,\u201d but curiously it doesn\u2019t expand upon that much. About the only thing it notes is Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that mentions Barr would be working with Giuliani.\n\nAD\n\nAnd that\u2019s indeed what the call shows. After Zelensky appears to agree to pursue the investigations Trump wants \u2014 including one involving Joe and Hunter Biden \u2014 Trump repeatedly says he will connect him with both Giuliani and Barr. He mentions Barr no fewer than five times, according to the rough transcript:\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call and I am also going to Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it.\"\n\n\u201cI will tell Rudy and Attorney General Barr to call.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to have the Attorney General call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.\u201d\n\nDespite these references, Barr\u2019s Justice Department played a central role in holding up the disclosure of the whistleblower complaint to Congress. As acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire testified Thursday, he consulted the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel, which overruled the inspector general\u2019s determination that the complaint was of \u201curgent concern\u201d \u2014 a legal threshold that would have required disclosure to Congress within seven days.\n\nAD\n\nWhat we learned from Maguire's public testimony\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division has also opted not to pursue a formal investigation of the complaint.\n\nAD\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) pressed Maguire on Thursday about whether it was appropriate to involve the Justice Department in withholding a complaint in which Barr was named. Maguire indicated he was just following required processes \u2014 \u201cI have to work with what I\u2019ve got, and that is the Office of Legal Counsel within the executive branch\u201d \u2014 yet Maguire also curiously played down Barr\u2019s potential role in the whistleblower\u2019s alleged wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI believe that the attorney general was mentioned in the complaint, not that he was a subject,\u201d Maguire said.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump\u2019s own words indicate that the wrongdoing that the whistleblower alleges was something he very much intended to involve Barr in.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s defense here is essentially that Trump never followed through. It issued an extensive denial on Wednesday, saying Barr had not:\n\nAD\n\nSpoken with Trump \u201cabout having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former vice president Biden or his son\u201d\n\nBeen asked by Trump to \u201cto contact Ukraine \u2014 on this or any matter\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunicated with Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other subject\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscussed this matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, with Rudolph W. Giuliani\u201d\n\nAdded spokeswoman Kerri Kupec, \u201cThe attorney general was first notified of the president\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky several weeks after the call took place, when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pretty ironclad. And it wouldn\u2019t be a total surprise if Trump hadn\u2019t followed through on getting Zelensky in touch with Barr. Trump often just says thing like this. Invoking the attorney general of the United States could be seen as a tactic to convey to Zelensky how high a priority Trump intended for this to be.\n\nAD\n\nBut Trump\u2019s call also indicates this is a situation in which he might have seen fit to involve his attorney general, despite its implications for his own reelection bid. And Barr hasn\u2019t exactly indicated that he has the strongest of walls erected to prevent political influence in the Justice Department; in 2017, he told The Washington Post that there would be nothing inherently wrong with a president requesting specific investigations.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe president is the chief executive, and if he believes there\u2019s an area that requires an investigation, there\u2019s nothing on its face wrong with that, there\u2019s nothing per se wrong about that,\u201d Barr said.\n\n(Barr went on to suggest that Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories about the Clintons and the origins of the Russia investigation were more worthy of investigation than was the Trump campaign\u2019s possible collusion.)\n\nAD\n\nTrump spent months bemoaning the fact that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions hadn\u2019t done enough to protect him as president, and he has notably sung a very different tune with Barr, perhaps suggesting he believes that Barr has satisfied that role. Trump has also indicated publicly that he would see nothing wrong with involving Barr in the efforts in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cCertainly it would be an appropriate thing to speak to him about, but I have not done that as of yet,\u201d Trump told Politico in May. \u201cIt could be a very big situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAnd despite plenty of controversy over Trump intermingling personal gain with law enforcement, he decided to tell a foreign leader that Barr would help that leader investigate things that clearly carried personal political benefit for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nBarr\u2019s denial is important, and lawmakers will probably want to get it under oath. But even if he didn\u2019t do anything regarding Ukraine, it raises questions about why his department believed it needed to inject itself into the transmission of the whistleblower complaint, given that he was mentioned in it. Overruling the \u201curgent concern\u201d decision by the inspector general was a significant step and one that could have buried the complaint for good.\n\nIt also raises questions about whether Barr himself was involved in these decisions.\n\nAD", "description": "Both the Trump-Zelensky call and the whistleblower complaint suggest possible involvement by the attorney general, whose Justice Department played a role in holding up disclosure of the complaint and opted not to investigate.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/M727NaUGH-Sg5OGEuqhs7sE2MIo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DW32J5VEGII6TJ3H26VYJLXT5E.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
