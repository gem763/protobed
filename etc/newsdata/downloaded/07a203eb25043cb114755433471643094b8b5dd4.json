U.S. officials have pointed fingers at Iran, without explicitly saying the Iranian government itself ordered the assault on the Abqaiq oil facility or that the drones and cruise missiles were launched from Iranian soil.\n\nTop Iranian officials warned they would respond to an attack with \u201call-out war.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump acknowledged that some people want him to strike Iran, while others are \u201cso thrilled\u201d with his sanctions-heavy approach.\n\n\u201cI think the sanctions work, and the military would work,\u201d Mr. Trump said at press conference with Mr. Morrison, though added: \u201cThat\u2019s a very severe form of winning.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump said Iran could be a \u201cgreat country, a rich country.\u201d\n\nBut they are choosing to go a different way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be very sorry for that choice.\u201d\n\nDescribing new sanctions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the central bank has sent billions to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and terrorist proxies.\n\n\u201cIran\u2019s brazen attack against Saudi Arabia is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cTreasury\u2019s action targets a crucial funding mechanism that the Iranian regime uses to support its terrorist network, including the Qods Force, Hezbollah and other militants that spread terror and destabilize the region. The United States will continue its maximum pressure campaign against Iran\u2019s repressive regime, which attempts to achieve its revolutionary agenda through regional aggression while squandering the country\u2019s oil proceeds.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo hailed the sanctions in a separate statement, saying Iran must face consequences for its aggression in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAttacking other nations and disrupting the global economy has a price, he said. \u201cThe regime in Tehran must be held accountable through diplomatic isolation and economic pressure.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
