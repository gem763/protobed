Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign sent a letter to the major television networks\u2019 heads and hosts on Sunday demanding they stop allowing Rudy Giuliani on the air, since Giuliani, who is President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, uses much of that airtime to spread unsubstantiated or debunked allegations about Biden and his son. His media appearances have proliferated recently as Giuliani has tried to deny or defend his and Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Ukrainian government to open a politically damaging investigation into Biden, efforts which so alarmed an intelligence community member working in the White House, they filed a formal whistleblower complaint, which subsequently led to a formal impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nGiuliani, Trump, and the president\u2019s allies have meanwhile worked to shift the focus to Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who has had business relationships in Ukraine that began while his father was still the vice-president. There is no evidence to support the Trump team\u2019s allegations, but they continue to talk about them as loudly as they can anyway, and Giuliani is one of their loudest voices on the mainstream air. The former mayor of New York has been trying to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens since at least May and has always seemed more than happy to publicize his efforts. He also has a talent for creating controversy and confusion with his television appearances, and has had countless opportunities to do so as one of the president\u2019s most tireless defenders.\n\nNow the Biden campaign wants to cut his microphone, arguing to the networks that, \u201cby giving him air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation,\u201d and emphasizing that Giuliani has \u201cdemonstrated that he will knowingly and willing lie in order to advance his own narrative.\u201d\n\n\"Pinocchio-laden\" is a generous way to describe Giuliani's TV hits. What the Biden campaign is saying, in essence, is that his conduct is beyond the norms of good-faith TV interviewing... \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 29, 2019\n\nThese are hardly new concerns regarding political coverage and the symbiotic \u2014 and often toxic \u2014 relationship between the media and the political class. It is criticism that has only gotten louder and more desperate in the Trump era. Excessive, spectacle-hungry media coverage was an essential factor in Trump\u2019s political rise, and it\u2019s something the television-addicted president has continued to feed and feed off of. Thankfully, the political media has evolved over the past few years \u2014 at least to the point where each and every Trump tweet no longer becomes its own unique news cycle \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot more work to do. Biden\u2019s campaign is correct when they note in their letter that the expanded use of on-air, real-time fact-checking isn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s a welcome and useful tool, but it can\u2019t address every false thing politicians say, erase what they\u2019ve said, or counteract the amplification that TV hits reliably afford Trump, Giuliani, and the many others who regularly mic-up to blast out the gaslit recriminations, straw men, and threats from Planet Trump. (And to be clear, no party or presidency will ever have a monopoly on self-serving bullshit.)\n\nThe Biden campaign\u2019s lecture goes on to list examples of Giuliani\u2019s truth-defying feats, note he\u2019s not a public official with some right to the airwaves, and highlight how often he contradicts himself. The campaign implores the networks \u2014 and the other members of the media whose attention the letter would undoubtedly attract \u2014 to think of the viewers, who Giuliani \u201cis not enlightening [in] any way,\u201d or \u201coffering a unique or informed perspective.\u201d The campaign also asked that equal time be awarded to Biden campaign surrogates, should the networks continue to invite Giuliani on the air.\n\nThis Week and Face the Nation apparently rejected the campaign\u2019s request to do that earlier Sunday.\n\nCounterpoint: Biden hasn't agreed to a single Sunday show sit-down this year. This week I asked for a campaign spokesperson to join me on CNN, and the invite was declined. \u2014 Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) September 29, 2019\n\nGiuliani, responding to the Daily Beast about the Biden camp\u2019s letter, called it at attempt at \u201cleft-wing censorship.\u201d\n\nHe probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about that. The networks will almost certainly keep having him on, especially now that The Impeachment is finally upon us. Giuliani isn\u2019t just some spinning commenter, but the president\u2019s attorney and primary collaborator in the scandal. His appearances are also undoubtedly considered good news-making television by many, regardless of any damage they may also do to the country or our understanding of logic. After all, what other Trump official can be counted on to regularly implicate other officials and/or admit the very things he is trying to deny live on the air.\n\nBiden and his campaign are surely frustrated, and they have a right to be. The ultimate purpose of the act the president may soon be impeached for \u2014 saddling Biden with a noisy, made-up scandal that can both inspire Trump rally chants and confuse swing voters like Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails did \u2014 is much more likely now than it was before the whistleblower complaint emerged.\n\nPerhaps Biden\u2019s campaign can successfully ramp up pressure on producers and hosts to be extra vigilant regarding Giuliani\u2019s disinformation efforts, or even overcompensate against them. But Giuliani is a symptom of a larger, older problem that will remain even if his remarks are quarantined to Fox News and OANN \u2014 or if Trump is impeached, removed from office, and ends up as the controversial new judge on Dancing With the Stars.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign sent a letter to major television networks demanding they stop allowing Rudy Giuliani on the air.
