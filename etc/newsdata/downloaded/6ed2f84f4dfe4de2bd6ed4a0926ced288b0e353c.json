They left the room that evening literally several news cycles behind\u2014and exasperated at the difficulty of keeping up with it all as they try to keep their eyes on the ball.\n\n\u201cI think we're being constantly invited to change the subject,\u201d remarked Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA), a vocal impeachment proponent, who was not locked away on Thursday but was exhausted by the news all the same. \u201cAnd constantly tempted to focus on the outrage du jour.\u201d\n\nIt has been accepted for some time that Democrats would have a challenge in maintaining the narrow focus they want for their impeachment inquiry\u2014in particular, Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2014given the broad concerns within the caucus about the president\u2019s conduct and his ability to spark fresh controversy daily.\n\nBut as the grab-bag of grounds for investigating Trumpworld grows at a faster pace than Democrats can keep up with, their cautiously plotted inquiry is being stretched in more directions than ever before. And that could open up new spaces for debate and disagreement within the caucus over how the probe should proceed\u2014namely, whether impeachment should be expanded to accommodate any accumulating evidence of wrongdoing, or if other grounds for impeachment should be set aside in order to preserve what has so far been a successful investigation.\n\nThe news that is most testing Democrats on this front is Trump\u2019s G7 gambit, which revived the discussion of the Constitution\u2019s emoluments clause that prohibits the president from taking any kind of gift or benefit from a foreigner.\n\nMany House Democrats have long believed that Trump has violated the clause due to the steady stream of foreign business at his D.C. hotel and now the steering of a high-profile international conference to his Florida resort. To date, only a small handful of lawmakers have been arguing that this should be a central focus in their impeachment probe\u2014but the brazenness of Trump\u2019s move could change that as the issue is thrust into the spotlight.\n\nA top House progressive, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), told The Daily Beast on Friday that there is a case to be made to write an article of impeachment based on the emoluments issue. \u201cWe have to see how strong we can make it,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, these things are being done in public so it makes it easy.\u201d\n\nAnd Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who was among the first lawmakers to advocate for impeachment on the grounds of emoluments, said Friday there\u2019s \u201cmore than enough\u201d material out there now to write such an article.\n\nHardly any Democrats shrug off the issue of the president\u2019s profiting off his properties, but there\u2019s a genuine split over whether impeachment is the proper way to respond to it. Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) pointed to language in House-passed spending bills that prohibits the administration from spending federal funds at Trump properties, which would make it impossible to host a G7 summit at his Doral hotel.\n\n\u201c Impeachment is a last resort,\u201d said Malinowski on Friday. \u201cWe have the power of the purse, and we can use the power of the purse. There\u2019s no reason to make it a part of an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leadership will decide whether or not emoluments are included as part of an impeachment inquiry when the House Judiciary Committee draws up the final articles of impeachment, which is expected to come at some point this fall.\n\nBut the success so far that Democrats have seen in securing revealing witness testimony already had Democrats wondering how much more they actually need in order to make a persuasive impeachment case to the American people. Mulvaney\u2019s admission on Thursday that there was quid pro quo\u2014and that it\u2019s not a big deal anyway\u2014only supercharged that sentiment, leaving some itchy trigger fingers within the caucus. And yet there\u2019s still a long line of depositions scheduled for next week, including testimony from Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine who is believed to have witnessed at least part of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign firsthand.\n\n\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t have to hear from as many witnesses, because we\u2019re starting to get a lot of confessions,\u201d said Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) when asked about Mulvaney\u2019s remarks as he left the Sondland deposition on Thursday. \u201cI think we just try to stay focused and be purposeful, because in 118 days, people start voting in the election.\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t a whole lot of disagreement with that sentiment among House Democrats. But it does have some of them wondering if they couldn\u2019t be doing more, from pushing the emoluments to further probing the complex web of foreign connections woven by Trump and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which some members around the caucus are anxious to start unraveling.\n\n\u201cI think we have the bandwidth to pursue accountability for Giuliani's kind of mafia-like affairs\u2026 for the corruption and the emoluments, for the whole suite of misconduct that we're dealing with,\u201d said Huffman. \u201cBut some of it is just inherently time-consuming. And I think that's the frustration. I believe all of it rises to the level of impeachable. In a different in a better political climate, we would include all of it, and we probably would have impeached this guy by now.\u201d But, Huffman added, he doesn\u2019t \u201csecond-guess\u201d leadership\u2019s strategy and the results it has yielded so far.\n\nEven among Democrats who view a broad range of impeachable conduct on the part of the president, the overwhelming desire to not screw up their inquiry may win the day.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you impeach the president on one article or 10,\u201d a Democratic aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cYou can only remove him from office once. The problem of having too many crimes to choose from is not a terrible problem to have.\u201d", "description": "\u201cI think we're being constantly invited to change the subject,\u201d remarked Rep.
