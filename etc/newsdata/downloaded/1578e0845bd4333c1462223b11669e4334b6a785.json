It facilitates investment, trade and tourism.\"\n\nAt the same time, he is not convinced that Africa\u2019s leaders fully appreciate aviation\u2019s strategic importance and the benefits it delivers.\n\nThat is why AASA, alongside the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Air Transport Action Group and ICAO, persistently draw government authorities, regulators and policy-makers\u2019 attention to these benefits.\n\n\"Our aim is to encourage collaboration and achieve mutually beneficial solutions,\" said Zweigenthal.\n\nHowever, inconsistent policies within and between states must be addressed, in his view.\n\n\"A positive development is the African Union\u2019s attempt to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area. When fully implemented, it will be the world\u2019s largest single trading bloc. Aviation, trade and tourism are among the key pillars,\" he said.\n\n\"Trade and tourism will flourish if people and goods can move freely throughout the continent in a visa-free and streamlined customs environment.\"\n\nIn his State of the Nation Address this year, President Cyril Ramaphosa vowed to increase SA's economic growth through tourism, stating an ambition to more than double international tourist arrivals to 21 million by 2030, Fin24 previously reported.\n\nAccording to an annual review by the World Travel & Tourism Council, travel and tourism in South Africa contributed 1.5 million jobs and R425.8bn to the economy in 2018, representing 8.6% of all economic activity in the country and making SA the largest tourism economy in Africa.\n\n* Fin24 is a guest of AASA at its AGM.", "description": "Low-cost airlines can be a booster for SA's economy, creating jobs and fostering skills development, according to Airline Association of Southern Africa CEO Chris Zweigenthal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9218/c3dbfafae2ce4ef29a64015c1703a67e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
