The owner of the iconic Canadian restaurant chain Tim Hortons and U.S. fast-food brands Burger King and Popeyes will be watched closely to see if it can duplicate the positive results it posted in the second quarter, when it exceeded analysts\u2019 predictions.\n\nIn the last quarter, the RBI pointed to its move to include plant-based proteins in its menus as one of the reasons for its good showing. The Tim Hortons chain, however, pulled its Beyond Meat burger and breakfast sandwich from its menus in all markets outside of Ontario and British Columbia in September, explaining these options were only introduced on a \u201climited time only\u201d basis.\n\nBank of Canada Rate Announcement\n\nThe Bank of Canada will make an interest on Wednesday, as well as unveil an update to its economic forecast.\n\nIt is expected the Canadian central bank will not move its key interest rate, but its economic update will be closely eyed for indications of future moves.\n\nBell Earnings Due Thursday\n\nBCE Inc. (TSX: ) will release its third-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Thursday.\n\nThe report will be for the three-month period ending Sept. 30. Analysts will be watching to see how its mobile revenues perform, especially after Rogers Communications last week cut its revenue expectations for the fiscal year.\n\nAre Things Looking Up For SNC-Lavalin?\n\nLast Tuesday, the shares of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc . (TSX: ) jumped an impressive 14%. This was the morning after the federal election. Investors took the news of a Liberal minority government as a positive given its stance on offering the construction giant a deferred prosecution agreement, a subject that plagued the ruling Liberals leading up to last week\u2019s vote.\n\nSNC-Lavalin will report its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.\n\nCanadian companies reporting this week:\n\nMonday:\n\nA&W Revenue Royalties Income Fund (TSX: )\n\nAccord Financial Corp.
