On tour, she\u2019s given us fabulous takes on Dolly Parton and Etta James. Thanks to The Kelly Clarkson Show, you can now see her sing a Cher song. Yet somehow, the queen of covers had never taken on one of the best vocalists of all time, Whitney Houston, until today. That\u2019s right: Seventeen years after her Idol debut, we finally have a Kelly x Whitney performance for the books. She needs to start her talk show on an upbeat note, so don\u2019t expect \u201cI Will Always Love You\u201d \u2014 instead, she has the whole crowd up and dancing to \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody.\u201d Not only is it instantly iconic from the first taps of synth to the perfect key change, but it looks to be some of the most fun Ms. Clarkson has had on her show. She\u2019s singing with the audience! She\u2019s working the crowd and telling them to come on! She\u2019s doing that slight back-and-forth sway she does when she\u2019s in her element! And we just want to be there to dance.\n\nRelated", "description": "For today\u2019s Kellyoke, Kelly Clarkson finally treated us to a cover of Whitney Houston with a lively performance of \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/24/24-kelly-clarkson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
