Volunteer fireman Anthony Banas, took notice of the little girl during a presentation on safety equipment.\n\n\u201cWe were showing the children our gear to make it less scary than it might be in a real situation, and I noticed Kayli in the corner with her teacher,\u201d Banas, 25, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cShe looked afraid.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanas had paid particular attention to the little girl because his 20-year-old brother also has autism, and he recognized the signs that she was in distress. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have that usual shyness of children her age,\u201d Banas tells Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session with the children, Kayli spontaneously approached Banas and hugged him, pleasing the first responder, who also serves as an emergency room technician and a Navy Reservist. Someone photographed the moment and the image was soon shared on the fire department\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nThe department also posted a message from Templeton on Facebook. \u201c....I didn't even know she was struggling that day until I saw this picture,\u201d wrote the mom-of-two, who is pregnant with her third child. \u201cThere were new people in her regular environment asking kids to try this and do this which would be AWESOME to most kids \u2014 but for her it can be overwhelming.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nTempleton wrote of Banas, \u201cThis sweet man let her cuddle, and relax right there on his lap for who knows how long because he could just tell she was having a hard time... As a parent, this kind of diagnosis can leave you wondering how each day is going to be. If someone is going to show her compassion, or judgement. And yesterday, it was compassion. Anyway, it warmed my heart and I thought the community should know the story behind the photo they posted yesterday\u201d\n\nKayli and Banas have already reunited at the station, as depicted in a Fox 40 interview, where the tot played on the fire truck and gave high-fives to her new hero. Templeton tells Yahoo Lifestyle that Banas showed Kayli kindness instead of viewing her as \u201cbratty.\u201d To her point, Banas says that kids with autism deserve patience during difficult moments, not judgement.\n\n\u201cKayli is on this firefighter kick now,\u201d Templeton tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cThe department is right down the street from our home, so we will have to visit again.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\n\n\n", "description": "A 3-year-old girl with autism felt overwhelmed during a preschool safety lesson and got a hug from a firefighter.", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/la9APY97JEPAYUURz82kHA--~B/aD05NjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1c3f3b70-f2b1-11e9-85df-8735598e8f5f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
