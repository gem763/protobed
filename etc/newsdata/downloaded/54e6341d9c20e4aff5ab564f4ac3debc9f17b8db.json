Debt bondage is what we are trying to tackle,\" Law said.\n\nMigrant rights groups welcomed the initiative but warned its implementation could be problematic as countries such as Indonesia would only allow workers to go abroad through its locally-approved agencies.\n\n\"It could be quite chaotic for the sending country because they want to monitor the whereabouts of the workers,\" said Alex Ong from advocacy group Migrant Care, which campaigns for migrant workers in Malaysia.\n\nRecruitment agencies are not allowed to charge workers in the formal sectors - such as manufacturing and plantation - fees that are higher one month's salary, under current guidelines set by the employers' group, the Malaysian Employers' Federation.\n\nBut domestic workers are excluded from the clause, and typically have to spend six months with almost all their wages deducted to cover the costs they owe the recruiters for local travel or medical tests, said Ong.\n\n\"The question is why this protection is not applicable for domestic workers too,\" asked Ong, calling for a legal reform.\n\nMalaysia is home to an estimated 212,000 of about 40 million people trapped in modern slavery worldwide, according to the Global Slavery Index by human rights group Walk Free Foundation.\n\n($1 = 4.1910 ringgit) (Reporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi; Editing by Michael Taylor.
