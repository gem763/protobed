The DUP welcomed the proposals for ensuring Northern Ireland \u201cwould be out of the EU customs union and the single market as with the rest of the United Kingdom\u201d.\n\nA spokesperson added that the proposals respected the spirit and principles of the Good Friday agreement.\n\nOthers in Northern Ireland, however, warned of grave economic and political consequences. Sinn F\u00e9in called the plan \u201can act of political sabotage\u201d for the region. Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s vice-president, Michelle O\u2019Neill, said her party could not accept a DUP veto on extending the arrangement in a potential vote in 2025.\n\n\u201cThere can be no situation whatsoever when the DUP are going to be afforded a veto, a lock, a blocking mechanism of any form in which to thwart any progress that could potentially be made on Brexit between both the EU and the British government,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour party leader, Colum Eastwood, described Johnson\u2019s plan as \u201cdead on arrival\u201d.\n\n'Nobody wants us': fears of forgotten on Northern Irish border Read more\n\nGlyn Robert, the head of Retail NI, said the proposal would lead to north-to-south tariffs with \u201chuge negative impacts\u201d on farmers and the agri-food sector. \u201cIt would also mean two borders requiring renewal after four years, surveillance in border communities without their consent and checks north-south and west-east.\u201d\n\nOther business groups echoed the alarm. \u201cAll the promises of unfettered access have been abandoned ... NI is a small business economy and this is a death knell for some of those businesses,\u201d Tina McKenzie, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses for Northern Ireland, told Sky.\n\nAodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the proposals seemed to shred a joint UK-EU pledge in 2017 to keep a frictionless border.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to complexity, delays, tariffs, VAT and cost rises that will make NI goods less competitive and squeeze our household budgets. The measures are predicated on intrusive surveillance which will put a burden on business and be disruptive for border communities. In short these proposals are unworkable and unpalatable,\u201d he said.\n\nManufacturing Northern Ireland, an advocacy group, warned in a tweet: \u201cThe Boris plan unveiled today ... also means surveillance in border communities without their consent, checks N/S and W/E, no exemptions, no market access and import VAT. #disaster.\u201d\n\nThe DUP stood isolated in endorsing the plan as an alternative to the backstop. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, urged the EU to take the offer seriously \u2013 risking a backlash from business owners and farmers, who traditionally support the party.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, backed Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for leaving the customs union. Photograph: James Veysey/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan, which he termed a \u201cfair and reasonable compromise\u201d, involves the the UK leaving the EU on 31 October with a transition period as originally envisaged until the end of December 2020, but with the vexed issue of the Irish border being solved by a specific proposal for Northern Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland would remain in regulatory alignment with the EU until 2025 but emerge from the customs union with the rest of the UK. It proposes that at the end of 2025 Northern Ireland in conjunction with Ireland would decide on the level of regulatory alignment through a Belfast-Dublin \u201cbilateral lock\u201d in a British-Irish ministerial council. This would mean customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic from 1 January 2021, which is anathema to Dublin and DUP\u2019s rivals in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cWhat I have heard from Boris Johnson today is more bluster,\u201d said Michelle O\u2019Neill, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader in Northern Ireland. \u201cHe is playing to the gallery of Tory party and playing fast and loose with Good Friday agreement.\u201d\n\nThe proposal did not respect Northern Ireland\u2019s complexities, interdependent economy and society, said the Alliance party leader, Naomi Long. The MEP doubted the Stormont assembly, which collapsed in 2017, could be revived and decide whether to continue alignment with EU single market regulations or to align with Britain.\n\n\u201cIt would not only be unworkable, but would place any chance to get the assembly up and running in complete jeopardy. There is simply no chance of any of this actually happening \u2026 these are farcical proposals and in no way serious,\u201d Long said.\n\nNon-DUP unionists, in contrast, worried that Johnson\u2019s plan would tie Northern Ireland to EU regulations, even if temporarily, while the rest of the UK went its own way. \u201cIn essence, Northern Ireland will be in a different relationship with the EU to the rest of the UK,\u201d said Lord Empey, of the Ulster Unionist party.\n\nJamie Bryson, a loyalist blogger, accused the DUP of betrayal. \u201cAn economic united Ireland is unacceptable for even one day, let alone until 2025 as part of a \u2018conditioning\u2019 phase for permanent economic unity. Utterly shameful.\u201d", "description": "Northern Ireland leaders, apart from DUP, condemn Johnson plan likely to \u2018destroy economy and Good Friday agreement\u2019", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a0dd4374eae83d650c6fd387793d5ba270756a/0_130_5119_3072/master/5119.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=98077e28e3e1281d812d7663fa8a5e6f"}
