REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nBorn Jose Romula Sosa Ortiz, the singer known for romantic ballads that captivated Latin America for more than half a century died last month in Miami at age 71.\n\nFans in Mexico, where the singer started on the road to stardom as a child, poured into the streets of the capital to see the hearse carrying Jose Jose\u2019s casket, escorted by a dozen motorcycles and trailed by cars with family members.\n\nSome fans arrived before dawn to claim a spot in line to watch the memorial at the Palace of Fine Arts. Others followed the hearse as it made its way from the airport, singing his songs and taking photos of the motorcade.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an exceptional singer. He sings stories through his music,\u201d said Gilberto Martinez, watching the ceremony on a giant video screen outside the palace.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know him, you haven\u2019t understood what love is, what falling out of love is, what Jose Jose wanted to show us with each one of his songs - above all with his voice,\u201d he said.\n\nJose Jose received several Grammy nominations, sold more than 250 million albums and was once courted by music legend Frank Sinatra, who wanted to sign him to his music label.\n\nA symphony orchestra, mariachi band and other artists honored Jose Jose\u2019s legacy by performing some of his hits, including \u201cThe Sad One\u201d and \u201cThe Ship of Oblivion.\u201d\n\nFans filed past the casket with two red roses and a gold-hued microphone placed on top, taking photos and throwing flowers on the crimson carpet.\n\n\u201cI feel it in my soul, a wound that will never (heal), it will always be there. He will leave, but he\u2019ll live on in our hearts,\u201d said Elsa Arias.\n\nBroadcaster Televisa reported the singer died after complications following treatment for pancreatic cancer. Jose Jose announced two years ago that he had a tumor in his pancreas that was being treated with chemotherapy.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the family led a funeral procession through the singer\u2019s former neighborhood before attending mass at the Basilica of Guadalupe.\n\nHe was buried at the French Pantheon cemetery, where some former presidents were also laid to rest.", "description": "Waving white roses, singing ballads and clutching portraits of a dapper man in a tuxedo, thousands of fans paid tribute to late pop crooner Jose Jose on Wednesday at a music-filled ceremony in Mexico City.", "authors": ["Roberto Ramirez", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439080028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9902S-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
