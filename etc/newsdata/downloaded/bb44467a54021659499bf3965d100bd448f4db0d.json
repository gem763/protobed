The Chargers can rescind those fines if they choose to, but it's unclear if they will do so at this point.\n\nGordon missed the Chargers' organized team activities, training camp and all of preseason hoping to secure a new long-term deal. His agent, Damarius Bilbo, told Anderson in August he requested a trade on behalf of his client when Los Angeles didn't increase its initial extension offer worth roughly $10 million per year.\n\nThe Chargers have dealt with a host of injuries to start this season. Starting offensive tackle Russell Okung, safety Derwin James and defensive backs Adrian Phillips and Trevor Williams are all on injured reserve.\n\nAustin Ekeler has been a solid replacement for Gordon through three games. The 24-year-old leads the team with 57 touches and four total touchdowns and ranks second with 368 yards from scrimmage.\n\nBringing Gordon back into the fold gives offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt another playmaker who can help them improve on their current scoring average of 20 points per game.", "description": "The  Los Angeles Chargers ' ailing roster will receive a welcome addition Thursday when  Melvin Gordon  ends his holdout...", "authors": ["Adam Wells"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/000/hi-res-1fd98659983d39eeed0ca380a767f7e1_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
