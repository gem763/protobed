For the NHS that is going to mean further comprehensive action building on the reduction of our carbon footprint of one fifth in the past decade.\n\n\u201cSo our NHS energy use, supply chain, building adaptations and our transport will all need to change substantially.\u201d", "description": "The boss of the NHS has declared an air pollution \"emergency\" as a major study today shows it causes hundreds of heart attacks and strokes every year.", "authors": ["Lizzie Roberts", "Camilla Tominey", "Liz Truss", "Nick Timothy", "Iain Duncan Smith", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/01/17/PX3117282_Geoff-Pugh_Ahm0055225_009JPG-National-Health-Service-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oKvsR92XMfIiNGFNT0OjfbA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
