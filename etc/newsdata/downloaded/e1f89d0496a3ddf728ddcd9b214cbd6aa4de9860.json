Include your name and location, even if you want them withheld. Letters may be edited.\n\nLet\u2019s start with two letters this week. No. 1:\n\nI am an advertising creative who has been unemployed for over six months. I\u2019m having difficulty finding a full-time role because I fear that, in my 50s, I\u2019ve been thrown out with the trash in favor of \u201cnew blood.\u201d No matter how I tailor my job applications, cover letters and C.V. with clever approaches, I can\u2019t get my foot in the door \u2014 only compliments on my videos or LinkedIn connections. But LinkedIn connections don\u2019t pay the rent. I\u2019ve sent solicited and unsolicited applications to more than 100 companies, but no luck. Some of this could be because I haven\u2019t recently won any major industry awards \u2014 which carries weight in this competitive industry. Or maybe the positions are genuinely filled. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling that, if I applied for a role 20 or even 10 years ago, I wouldn\u2019t need to write this letter. I can\u2019t hide my experience, nor can I turn back the clock. And now time and money are running out. \u2014 London\n\nAnd No. 2:\n\nPeople need to stop prefacing workplace conversations with older people with terms like \u201cHon,\u201d \u201cDear,\u201d or \u201cSweetie.\u201d Ageism is real and despicable, and it is becoming more and more prevalent. Those of us who are still in the work force particularly loathe those terms. At 66, I am in excellent health. I dress well, walk fast to my workplace and pride myself on every compliment. (I earned them!) Yet too many professionals presume I am hard of hearing, frail, forgetful or otherwise impaired to the point where they address me as one would a small child. Could it be the silver bob? Then presume I\u2019m Miranda Priestly, not your great-grandma. And yes, of course I have email, and yes, I actually would prefer text, and yes, I am going to swirl around you fast enough on my sneaker-clad feet to make you spin if you do not stop texting and crawling along Fifth Avenue. And hell no, I do not want a childproof cap on anything that threatens to ruin my expensive manicure or sprain my hand worse than the heaviest weights I lift at the gym, because no, I do NOT have any children or grandchildren! \u2014 New York\n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to be the \u201cexpert\u201d here and behave \u201cprofessionally,\u201d but: New York, will you be my best friend? I like expensive manicures, admire Miranda Priestly, have never called anyone \u201csweetie,\u201d and aspire to both a chic silver bob and your level of pithy and acerbic writing. Call me.\n\nNow then: Ten columns into this gig, I have a solid archive of questions about age discrimination, and very few good answers. It is a huge issue , and it is absurdly difficult to combat \u2014 truly a terrible combination for an advice columnist! New York, you\u2019re surely right that you\u2019re being patronized for your age, and London, you\u2019re surely right that your age unfairly plays into how your job applications are evaluated. The problem, as I learned when I turned to an outside expert for guidance, is that age discrimination is uniquely difficult to prove \u2014 by design. A 2009 Supreme Court decision endorsed a higher standard for showing advanced age is the cause of disparate treatment in the workplace than the threshold for other types of discrimination. \u201cAs a society \u2014 and I include the judiciary \u2014 we seem to view age discrimination as less serious and less wrong than other forms of discrimination because an employer has a right to run their business the way they want,\u201d says Laurie McCann, a senior attorney for AARP Foundation.", "description": "One writer, in his 50s, has applied to more than 100 jobs.
