Chinese state-run television network CCTV suspended its broadcast arrangements for the NBA's preseason games in China, and Tencent, which owns the digital streaming rights for the NBA in China, also suspended its preseason broadcast agreement.\n\n\"I don't know where we go from here,\" Silver said at the summit. \"The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic.\"\n\nThe Chinese government asked the NBA to fire Morey for his now-deleted Oct. 4 tweet. In an Oct. 8 statement, Silver defended Morey's right to free speech, adding \"values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Silver said he told Chinese officials \"there's no chance\" Morey will be fired for speaking his mind.\n\n\"There's no chance we'll even discipline him,\" Silver said.\n\nA spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, however, on Friday denied that China asked for Morey to be fired, according to Reuters.\n\n\"We especially went to the relevant departments to check on this claim,\" Geng said during the ministry's daily briefing in Beijing, according to the Reuters story. \"The Chinese government has never made this kind of request.\"\n\nA league executive, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue, said it might take the NBA a few months to feel the losses, maybe by next quarter. He said officials have already started best- and worst-case projections, hoping they can prepare for any real decline in revenue.", "description": "\"The financial consequences have been and may continue to be fairly dramatic,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said of the league's spat with China.", "authors": ["Jabari Young"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/101620415-486927203.jpg?v=1398703226", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
