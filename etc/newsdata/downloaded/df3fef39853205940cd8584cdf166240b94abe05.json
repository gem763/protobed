The Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL have been announced for real.\n\nAnd as an added bonus, they're both cheaper than last year's counterparts.\n\nEvery Exciting Google Assistant Feature Announced Today Made by Google 2019 is finally underway. And thanks to the Pixel 4 getting leaked to the point of exhaustion, we had a pretty good idea of what to expect heading in. But the tech titan still managed to unveil some surprises on the Google Assistant front, with new applications and integrations across Google\u2019s devices. Read more\n\nThe smart phone industry in general has made it normal for handsets prices to skyrocket every year. And this is why we were pleasantly surprised to discover that this year Google actually made the Pixels cheaper.\n\nBut perhaps we should have seen this move coming. After all, earlier this year the company redefined what we should expect from a mid-priced phones with the Pixel 3a.\n\nAnd to be fair, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL were absolutely priced too high for handsets that contained mostly incremental upgrades from the Pixel 2 range.\n\nThis year we're seeing some beefier specs, with a new Snapdragon 855 processor, upgraded RAM and bigger batteries.\n\nIt also has what Google is calling Pixel Neaural Core, which reportedly allows for powerful and fast processing.\n\nThe device also includes the Titan M security chip, which will work with Android 10 security updates for added data security.\n\nBut the narrative the Google is really pushing this year is the upgraded camera.\n\nWhile the main rear lens remains 12MP, the telephoto has jumped from 8MP to 16MP.\n\nIf you were hoping for a wide-angle lens - no dice. In fact, a Google rep said during the briefing that wide-angle is \"fun\" but they find telephoto to be more important.\n\nThe Night Sight also looks stunning this year, by adding astrophotography. Google is boasting that it can capture stars and even the Milky Way on a clear night. We can't wait to test this out.\n\nThe Pixel 4 also adds to the HDR+ that has been in the range from the first generation by adding Live HDR+ to the view finder. This means that you'll apparently be able to see how the shot will turn out even in poor or low lighting.\n\nFor example, you can mess with the highlights and the shadows before you even click the shutter.\n\nYou'll also find a wider selfie camera, as well as AI-white balancing.\n\nOne of the biggest non-hardware leaks over the past few weeks has been Motion Sense, which us powered by a radar - a first for any smart phone.\n\nA wave of the hand will allow you to do things like skip music tracks, silence your phone, snooze alarms and dismiss timers.\n\nThanks to the Motion Sense radar your phone will also know when to initiate face unlock when you reach for your phone, and know to turn the screen off when you're not around.\n\nIn the live demo from Made By Google they showed the alarm volume lowering as a hand reached for the phone, which is a nice touch that I know I'll appreciate early in the morning.\n\nThis all sounds very cool, but we're keen to see how it works in practice - especially when it comes the phone having a lot of different people around it.\n\nOn the software front, the leaked Recorder app is also legit and we're damn excited about it.\n\nNot only will it record audio, it transcribes the speech in real time and will tag different sounds such as music and applause.\n\nYou can also look for instances of certain words - search a word and it will bring up all of the time stamps where it occurred in the recording.\n\nAll of this happens on-device as well, so you don't need to worry about your recordings being listened to somewhere.\n\nIf this works as well as Google says it's going to be a game changer for so many professions, not to mention students.\n\nA new Google Assistant will also be on the way over the summer via a software update.\n\nWe don't know a whole lot yet, but it will reportedly be faster and allow you to multitask across apps and search your phone.\n\nNow, let's get down to the cold, hard specs.\n\nPixel 4 Pixel 4 XL Operating System Android 10 Android 10 Display 5.7-inch 1080p+ with 90Hz refresh rate 6.3-inch 1440p+ with 90Hz refresh rate Body 68.8 x 147.1 x 8.2 mm, 162 grams 75.1 x 160.4 x 8.2 mm, 193 grams Camera Rear: 12.2MP \u0192/1.7 main and 16MP \u0192/2.4 aperture telephoto with 4K video resolution.
