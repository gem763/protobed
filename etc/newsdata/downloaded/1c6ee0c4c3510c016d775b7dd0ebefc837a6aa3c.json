This brings its total raised to $32 million, following an earlier $12.3 million series A. NewSpring Capital led the round, with participation from Blossom Street Ventures and current investor TVC Capital.\n\nFounder and CEO Jan Arendtsz, a former NetSuite integration services director, said the fresh funds will fuel product R&D and the development of Celigo\u2019s automation technologies. \u201cCeligo has reimagined what integration should be,\u201d he added. \u201cWith today\u2019s proliferation of business applications, the older generation of iPaaS solutions has hit its limits. Celigo\u2019s mission is to simplify the building and management of all integrations, without any compromise in capabilities, so that both IT and business users can work side by side to automate business processes.\u201d\n\nCeligo hasn\u2019t achieved the name recognition of Jitterbit, MuleSoft, and other rivals occupying the multibillion-dollar iPaaS market, but its process integration and software automation products are no less robust, on the whole. Each is designed to facilitate the management of connections among hundreds of distinct third-party platforms and services, in part through a step-by-step setup wizard that includes API assistants and adaptors for JSON, XML, FTP, AS2, EDI, SQL, webhooks, and more.\n\nUsing the Integrator tool, customers can create or tap preconfigured templates available through Celigo\u2019s marketplace. Those same customers can generate multiple imports and exports as part of a single integration flow and build and share their own stacks while bulk-uploading hundreds or even millions of records to popular cloud apps. Additionally, from a bespoke dashboard built into Celigo\u2019s backend, they\u2019re able to monitor and troubleshoot integration flows and re-run these flows (or view error details) if need be.\n\nFor clients seeking a more plug-and-play solution, there\u2019s Celigo\u2019s integration apps, or standalone software-as-a-service apps that connect two or more enterprise applications. They come ready to deploy with flows for common use cases, and they\u2019re regularly updated with bug fixes and security patches.\n\nCeligo\u2019s CloudExtend targets NetSuite and Salesforce customers \u2014 including Evernote, Sony, Peloton, and Rubbermaid \u2014 with products that connect apps from the aforementioned two brands. Its team specifically focuses on Excel, Outlook, and Gmail integrations, along with other enterprise resource management and customer relationship management automations. CloudExtend for NetSuite enables users to access and edit NetSuite data directly from within Excel, for example, and to leverage functions to retrieve, update, add, and delete data from multiple record types. Meanwhile, CloudExtend for Outlook memorializes key emails and file attachments on NetSuite records.\n\nCeligo says its Salesforce-NetSuite integration app is used by over 1,000 companies. More broadly, it counts among its paying customers brands like J.D. Powers, Glassdoor, Twilio, Crossfit, Buscemi, Tea Forte, Brandmuscle, Lootcrate, Docker, Foursquare, Carbonite, Sumo Logic, Looker, and \u201cthousands\u201d of others.\n\n\u201cAs companies, both small and large, seek digital transformation to compete in the modern economy, they\u2019re looking for integration solutions to automate business processes at scale and with quick time to value,\u201d said NewSpring Partner\u2019s Brian Kim. \u201cWe believe Celigo is well positioned to capture greater iPaaS market share, due to its unique simplicity and flexibility.\u201d\n\nTVC Capital Managing Partner\u2019s Steve Hamerslag added: \u201cWe are thrilled with Celigo\u2019s progress to date and believe that this next round of funding will fuel our next level of growth.\u201d", "description": "San Francisco-based integration platform-as-a-service company Celigo announced that it has raised $20 million in venture capital.", "authors": ["Kyle Wiggers"], "top_image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ca6c3f9c-13f0-4034-a298-37332066c188.jpg?w=1200&strip=all", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
