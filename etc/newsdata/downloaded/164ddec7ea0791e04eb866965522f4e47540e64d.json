How beautiful life would be if it worked like that.\n\n\u2018I thought it would be a beautiful thing to be part of, so I did it.\u2019\n\nThe writer wants to send a positive message of religious tolerance (Picture: Alexander Crawley)\n\nBrides Hannah and Megan campaigned for gay rights in Australia for years. When Salma met them, she wondered why they hadn\u2019t just wed abroad.\n\nBut they said they wanted to commit to each other where they live, in their home country.\n\nFast forward to a few years later, when Australia passed its Marriage Amendment in 2017, and Hannah and Megan were finally able to plan their wedding.\n\nThey enlisted Salma\u2019s help, asking her to become their celebrant.\n\nTo become a celebrant in Australia, you have to do various courses, need to have lived in the country for six months and then have to do a qualification there.\n\nRealising that this wouldn\u2019t be an option, Salma and the couple found another solution \u2013 something called My Celebrant Buddy which allows a qualified celebrant to do all the legal bits while a chosen unofficial celebrant can take on special parts of the ceremony.\n\n\u2018I thought it would be a beautiful thing to be part of so I did it\u2019 (Picture: Alexander Crawley)\n\nWhile Salma has experience speaking in public as a spoken word artist, acting as a celebrant was an entirely new experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m used to being on a stage and talking but this is different,\u2019 Salma tells us. \u2018This is someone\u2019s wedding day and it was a lot more pressure because I felt like I was holding hearts in my hand.\n\n\u2018It was a meeting of hearts and they trusted me to marry them in front of all their friends and family. It was nerve-wracking writing and performing it at the ceremony.\n\n\u2018I wanted to write something that was super personal to them but also spoke to their struggle of fighting past this marriage act and the political significance of two women together.\u2019\n\nThe spoken word artist went to Australia to officiate the wedding (Picture: Salma El Wardany)\n\nThe choice to wed a lesbian couple provoked a strong reaction from Salma\u2019s Muslim community.\n\n\u2018When I initially posted the wedding, I got messages saying \u201cyou\u2019re not Muslim\u201d and \u201cIf you want to do these things, fine but don\u2019t say you\u2019re Muslim\u201d,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018I got a message from someone I\u2019ve known my whole life saying \u201cyour values are so opposed to what we believe in\u201d.\n\n\u2018It makes me so cross because that attitude is exactly the islamophobic attitude we get every day so you should know better than to purport that kind of negativity and acidic attitude.\n\n\u2018I got a lot of backlash but I just thought \u201cgood, feathers have been ruffled\u201d.\n\n\u2018This innate desire to silence is what immediately comes out but why be annoyed that this conversation is happening? I\u2019m deadset in having those conversations in our communities because it\u2019s so needed.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSalma isn\u2019t paying any mind to the haters, especially considering she has the support of her family.\n\nShe adds: \u2018My dad was like \u201cwhy are you doing it\u201d but I said because it sends a beautiful message of religious tolerance and everyone living together and he was like \u201cyeah okay, just be safe\u201d.\n\n\u2018The rest of my family thought it was beautiful.\u2019\n\nSalma believes that being a Muslim woman makes it easier for her to understand the plight of other oppressed people.\n\nShe says: \u2018We (Muslims and LGBT folks) sit on the outskirts of society, it\u2019s why I get along so well with them. There\u2019s something about oppressed people understanding one another\u2019s struggles even though they may be different.\u2019\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t able to get the qualifications to be a legal celebrant so she partnered up with another qualified one (Picture: Salma El Wardany)\n\nThe activist wants to be vocally supportive of the LGBTQ community, and so she has since agreed to marry more of her gay friends.\n\n\u2018I feel like I can\u2019t marry straight people,\u2019 she jokes, \u2018I can only do queer weddings!\n\n\u2018My friend Frank is getting married to his partner and when I was in Australia to marry Megan, he was proposed to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He then asked me to be his celebrant and I said yes. That wedding is in Dallas, Texas, scheduled for 2020. I\u2019m just traveling and marrying people all over the world!\u2019\n\nLast week, Salma\u2019s friend Laura and her partner Emma got engaged. They also said they can\u2019t imagine anyone else marrying them.\n\nTheir wedding will be held in Cornwall in 2021.\n\n\u2018I think I can only do one a year because they\u2019re so emotional and they take a lot,\u2019 says Salma. \u2018I have to be ordained, it\u2019s a big task. I might just have to stop after that.\u2019\n\nThe process for these weddings will be easier than the Australian one, and Salma will be able to do the whole ceremony by herself.\n\nBeing an outspoken Muslim woman online, Salma has her fair share of hate from trolls who pile on no matter what her views are.\n\nWhen she\u2019s vocal about her support for gay people, she is told that she is \u2018encouraging\u2019 this kind of \u2018behaviour\u2019.\n\nTo that, she laughs. She says: \u2018I don\u2019t have that much power. People are going to be gay regardless of what I do. I have zero sway over the gaydom of the world.\u2019\n\nAnd, she adds, \u2018there are also gay Muslims. By humanising them you let them be gay and also worship God.\n\n\u2018When we refuse to converse with them and cover everything in sin and damnation, what we\u2019re doing is pushing people outside and they\u2019re going to do the things they want anyway, in ways that are unsafe or don\u2019t cater to their mental health.\n\n\u2018People have been gay since the start of times.\n\n\u2018Shouldn\u2019t we try to bolster our faith, not send someone on their way? Isn\u2019t God just love? Who are we to judge?\n\n\u2018Ultimately Lakum deenukum waliya deen \u2013 for you is your religion, for me is my religion.\u2019\n\nIn other words, just do you.\n\nMORE: Hindu-Muslim lesbian couple praised for stunning pics that \u2018brought India and Pakistan together\u2019\n\nMORE: British Muslims launch first ever pride festival\n\nMORE: \u2018Culture suffocates women\u2019: Muslim women talk faith, sexuality, and marriage in It\u2019s Not About the Burqa\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Writer Salma El Wardany was the celebrant of a lesbian wedding in Australia, two years after the country passed the Marriage Ammendment.", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SEI_24634787_1571213451.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
