Literally,\u201c and called the fires an \u201cinternational crisis.\u201c\n\nMacron\u2019s tweet was deeply ill-informed and misleading, but indistinguishable from the commentary of all the actors and singers who pride themselves more on their (alleged) social and environmental consciences than their knowledge. They got images that they believed were of today\u2019s Amazon fires wrong and repeated lazy cliches about \u201cthe lungs of the planet,\u201d wrapping it all in apocalyptic warnings of climate doom.\n\nAt least Diddy and Leonardo DiCaprio don\u2019t host multilateral meetings of Western heads of state.\n\nMacron does. He made the Amazon fires a major item of discussion at the G7 summit, with the ready assent of other Europeans governments. The Germans agreed that the Amazon fires are \"frightening and threatening.\"\n\n\u201cThe current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years\" \u2014 Eric Holthaus, meteorologist\n\nThe problem with the G7 summit wasn\u2019t that Donald Trump didn\u2019t get with the program; it was that the program itself, insofar as it dealt with the fires, relied on a hysteria-induced misunderstanding of what\u2019s happening in the Amazon.\n\nThe Amazon fires are catnip for proponents of swift and radical action on the climate. They pine for a mediagenic, easy-to-understand planetary emergency and are happy to manufacture one as necessary.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just celebrities who hyped the fires. A NBC News headline declared, \u201cAmazon wildfires could be 'game over' for climate change fight.\u201d The meteorologist Eric Holthaus related the opinion of a specialist in pre-historic fires in the Amazon that \u201cthe current fires are without precedent in the past 20,000 years.\u201d\n\nAccording to a story on CNN\u2019s website, \u201cAn inferno in the Amazon, two-thirds of which is in Brazil, threatens the rainforest ecosystem and also affects the entire globe.\u201d\n\nThis is the sense of imminent crisis that so moved Macron and his brethren, although it had little basis in reality. Some press reports, beneath the alarming headlines, related a more sober version of events, and a few isolated voices, most notably the environmentalist Michael Shellenberger at Forbes, pushed back against the dominant narrative.\n\nThe fires aren\u2019t an epochal event. According to the New York Times, the Brazilian agency tracking fires by satellite image reports that, at this point in the year, it\u2019s the highest number of fires identified since 2010, which obviously isn\u2019t thousands of years ago, indeed, not even a decade ago. In the 10 years prior to 2010, there were years when the number of fires was much higher.\n\nThe fires aren\u2019t the spontaneous result of global warming. The program director of the group Amazon Watch told CNN, \u201cThe vast majority of these fires are human-lit,\" noting that it isn\u2019t easy for the rainforest to catch fire, even in the dry season.\n\n\u201cNatural fires in the Amazon are rare,\u201d the Times reports, \u201cand the majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year\u2019s crops and pasture.\n\n\u201cMuch of the land that is burning was not old-growth rain forest, but land that had already been cleared of trees and set for agricultural use.\u201d\n\nNor is it true that deforestation in the Amazon is spiraling out of control. Deforestation markedly diminished in the 2000s, declining by 70 percent from 2004 to 2012, per Shellenberger. It has picked back up again under Brazil\u2019s new populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, a trend worth monitoring but hardly the onset of planetary catastrophe.\n\nSurely, the Amazon must be the lungs of the world, responsible for 20 percent of our oxygen, right? No. This is drivel based on an erroneous understanding of how the atmosphere gets its oxygen.\n\nIf we need trees to preserve a habitable planet, we should be pleased with recent trends. Ron Bailey of Reason magazine points to a study published in Nature last year that found there were nearly a million square miles of more tree canopy around the world in 2016 than in 1982, with Europe, the United States and China all adding canopy.\n\nAt the end of the day, the offer that the G7 made to Brazil of $20 million to help fight the Amazon fires was reasonable enough. The blustery Bolsonaro, who has blown hot and cold on the aid, would be foolish not to accept it. The Amazon is a natural wonder worth preserving on its own terms, and it could at some point get caught in a cycle of drought and fire.\n\nThe most fervent devotees of climate change don\u2019t really want science, no matter how often they invoke the word; they want drama and memorable images.\n\nStill, Macron and Co. need to be aware of how their high-handedness \u2014 including poorly informed declarations from afar \u2014 comes across in Brazil. Advanced countries that deforested long ago because it accorded with their economic interests should be humble when insisting that a poorer country not do the same. Proposals to buttress the Amazon have to run with the grain of Brazil\u2019s interests, not against it.\n\nThis will require sobriety, care and a long view\u2014in other words, exactly the opposite of what we haven\u2019t seen over the past couple of weeks. The most fervent devotees of climate change don\u2019t really want science, no matter how often they invoke the word; they want drama and memorable images, believing they will catalyze action in a way that a properly modulated account of the best research won\u2019t.\n\nIf they have to blow their credibility, one faux emergency at a time, so be it.\n\nRich Lowry is editor of National Review and a contributing editor with POLITICO Magazine.", "description": "The fires aren\u2019t an epochal event, and aren\u2019t the spontaneous result of global warming.", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Paul Dallison", "Kalina Oroschakoff"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164446769-1200x628.jpg"}
