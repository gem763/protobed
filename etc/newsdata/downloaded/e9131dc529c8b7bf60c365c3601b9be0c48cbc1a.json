They coded a list of adjectives and verbs, labeling them as either feminine or masculine, then searched a popular job site using the gendered words.\n\nThe researchers found that job-ads in typically male-dominated fields, like software programming, used masculine-coded language including \u201ccompetitive,\u201d \u201cdominate,\u201d or \u201cleader.\u201d while discovering that the mere presence of masculine words discourage women from applying as they feel like \u201cthey don\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nExamples of gendered words commonly used on job ads that may deter women from applying, found by Unitive.\n\nEmploying AI to reveal gender bias\n\nGender imbalance is apparent throughout the whole job searching process \u2014 men apply for a job when they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications, but women apply only if they meet 100 percent of them.\n\nThe reason we all should care about this isn\u2019t just political \u2014 gender equality is good for business, too. According to research, diverse teams build better products. A study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found that diverse companies produce 19 percent more revenue. Job ads that deter women from applying are not only problematic but also bad for business.\n\nTerms like \u201cproven\u201d and \u201cunder pressure\u201d used in job ads tend to attract more male candidates. But when companies use gender-neutral descriptions, they receive a broader applicant pool and the position will be filled three weeks faster than jobs using biased language. That\u2019s according to Textio, an AI-powered writing-enhancement service that analyzes job descriptions in real-time, highlighting jargon and words often perceived as masculine or feminine.\n\nUsing data science to reveal hidden gender bias in job descriptions, Textio will spell-check gender bias and give replacement options for all highlighted phrases where a gender-neutral synonym is available. The tool provides a \u201cTone Meter\u201d showing the overall gender tone of a document, compared to the industry as a whole. Some of Textio\u2019s suggestions may seem minor at first glance, but swapping out \u201cexceptional\u201d for \u201cextraordinary\u201d is statistically proven to attract more female applicants.\n\nTextio\u2019s \u201ctone meter\u201d helps employers to stay gender-neutral.\n\nWicked, maniacal Amazon\n\nMarissa Coughlin, Senior Director of Communications at Textio, based in Seattle, believes employer\u2019s write job posts to reach people who bring the culture that they want. \u201cThe language used can be pretty indicative to their company culture,\u201d Coughlin said.\n\nIn 2017, Textio analyzed 10 companies and the language patterns they use in their job posts. It found that Amazon used \u201cwickedly\u201d 33 times more than the rest of the tech industry and \u201cmaniacal\u201c 11 times more. \u201cHiring language like this can become very cyclical. Wickedly, for example, has been shown to statistically attract more men to a role,\u201d Coughlin added. \u201cUltimately, Textio is enabling people to uncover these patterns and change them before they publish the job post so they can have a diverse result.\u201d\n\nWhat qualifies as gendered language?\n\nA language pattern is considered gendered if it statistically changes the proportion of men and women who respond to a job post. The bias tool recently found that whenever a man is hired, the original job post he responded to averages almost twice as many masculine-tone phrases as feminine. And in jobs where a woman has been hired, the results were the exact opposite: twice as many feminine-tone phrases as masculine in the job post.\n\n\u201cThe bias in your original job post or recruiting email predicts who you\u2019re going to hire. This makes sense; the language you use changes who applies to your job, and you\u2019re much more likely to hire a woman into a tech role if your pipeline has several women to consider,\u201d Coughlin explained.\n\nLocation matters too\n\nTextio\u2019s research found that different phrases work differently geographically, \u201cthe corporate clich\u00e9, \u201csynergy\u201d in a job listing works particularly well in Salt Lake City, Honolulu, and Phoenix, but not in Miami, Philadelphia, or Washington, DC. Whereas the phrase \u201cintense\u201d helps jobs fill quickly in Portland, Denver, and Dallas, but not in Cleveland, San Francisco, or Chicago,\u201d said Coughlin.\n\nTextio\u2019s bias meter works to avoid not only gender bias, but minority bias too. \u201cOne compelling example with respect to different demographic profiles is that Textio sees that corporate clich\u00e9s turn away candidates in general, but they tend to deter candidates from underrepresented groups at a higher rate.\u201d\n\nMeasuring TNW\u2019s gender bias\n\nThe first step to improving diversity at the workplace: take a long, hard look at your own. Even companies with a conscious mind for recognizing bias can fall short when it comes to diversity and inclusion. So we put TNW to Textio\u2019s gender test using a current vacancy for a Senior Back-end Developer.\n\nThe results, putting it lightly, weren\u2019t great. The tool found that the ad \u201cmissed equal opportunity statements\u201d and \u201cincluded fixed mindset language.\u201d The Tone Meter showed similar results, deeming the same job ad \u201cvery masculine\u201d compared with over 152,000 other engineering job posts in the Netherlands. Considering that the programming industry is already very male-oriented, this is nothing to be proud of.\n\nTNW\u2019s results from its job ad for a software engineer.\n\nTo improve diversity and inclusion in industries where women are seriously underrepresented, extra attention should be given to the language used to prevent women, people of color, or members from minority groups from not applying. So TNW definitely needs to become better at this in the future.\n\nFinding the gender-neutral alternative\n\nGendered language in job postings that emphasizes competitiveness and assertiveness over teamwork and relationships may discourage women from applying. A study of job advertisements in the UK identified the top male-gendered words as \u201canalyze,\u201d \u201ccompetitive,\u201d \u201cactive,\u201d and \u201cconfident,\u201d whereas the top female-gendered words were \u201csupport,\u201d \u201cresponsible,\u201d \u201cunderstanding,\u201d \u201cdependable,\u201d and \u201ccommitment.\u201d\n\nIn a study published by Hire More Women in Tech, it found the gender-neutral alternative to popular words and phrases used in job ads.\n\nCredit: Hire More Women in Tech\n\nIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind that while technology is black and white, the world of humans is not. We can never solely rely on technology to prevent gender bias in job ads, but tools like Textio have the potential to create broader shifts in hiring strategies.\n\nBy combining a passion for people with the power of today\u2019s intelligent machines, Randstad supports people and organizations in realizing their true potential.
