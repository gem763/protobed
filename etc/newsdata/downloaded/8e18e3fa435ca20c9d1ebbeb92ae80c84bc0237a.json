Other backers of the statement included the UK, Canada, Germany and New Zealand.\n\n\u201cWe remain deeply concerned at the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia,\u201d Mansfield said. \u201cCivil society actors in Saudi Arabia still face persecution and intimidation. Human rights defenders, women\u2019s rights activists, journalists and dissidents remain in detention, or under threat. We are concerned at reports of torture, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, unfair trials, and harassment of individuals engaged in promoting and defending human rights, their families and colleagues.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia itself is a member of the 47-member UN Human Rights Council, though the country\u2019s ambassador was not in the room to hear the speech, having left to host his country\u2019s national day reception.\n\nBut a day later the Saudi ambassador, Abdulaziz Alwasil, launched an extraordinary broadside, targeting Australia.\n\nHe said minorities, migrants and Muslims face \u201chorrific violations of human rights \u2026 racist and extremist policies\u201d.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these have become popular and even accepted by some western parliaments, they are even sponsored by certain governments.\n\n\u201cWe see in some countries, radicalism against Muslims, we see xenophobia, racism. And some governments sympathise with them, like Australia. Here we refer to the massacre perpetrated by Brenton Tarrant \u2013 an Australian \u2013 which was based on hate speech.\u201d\n\nAlwasil condemned Australia\u2019s speech as ill-informed.\n\n\u201cWe have listened with great surprise to the statement of Australia on behalf of a group of states. In it, there are many mistakes and misleading information against my country. The Kingdom continues its reform policies in accordance with its values and Islamic teachings, especially with regards to the rights of women.\u201d\n\nThe coalition of mainly western countries said Saudi Arabia needed to demonstrate genuine accountability for the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October.\n\nSaudi officials at first denied responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s death, but eventually admitted he had been killed inside the consulate. A report published in June by the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions said there was credible evidence warranting further investigation of high-level Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The report also said that the circumstances \u201cpoint to a possible act of torture.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important that truth be established and accountability be achieved ... for Mr Khashoggi\u2019s loved ones \u2026 we call for an end to impunity for torture and extrajudicial killings,\u201d the statement read by the Australian ambassador said.\n\nAustralia may be complicit in war crimes if it supports Saudi-led coalition in Yemen \u2013 UN Read more\n\nEdwina MacDonald, the legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said Australian leadership to build international pressure on Saudi Arabia was welcomed.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Australian government for taking a principled stand and speaking up about extremely concerning human rights violations that another member of the council has been committing with impunity,\u201d MacDonald said.\n\n\u201cPublic condemnation like this from Australia and other countries will increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia \u2026 if you have a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, then you have an obligation to use it.\u201d\n\nThe UN feud complicates Australia\u2019s relationship with the Saudi kingdom. Australia sells weapons to Saudi Arabia, and Australia is a part of the US-led mission patrolling the Strait of Hormuz, a mission aimed at curbing Saudi antagonist Iran\u2019s actions in the Gulf.\n\nA UN report earlier this month detailed compelling evidence of possible war crimes by the Saudi-led coalition fighting a war against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia has starved civilians, bombed hospitals and blocked humanitarian aid during the five-year conflict in the gulf state.\n\nThe UN report warned that countries which arm the Saudi military, such as Australia, the US, UK and France, could also be guilty of war crimes.", "description": "Australia\u2019s ambassador earlier led a coalition of countries condemning the kingdom for human rights abuses", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47fd039b2828b2f2dde2e8099701a55c18761a66/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7da1e53a734d557fa2d00e5cb0b1ce81", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
