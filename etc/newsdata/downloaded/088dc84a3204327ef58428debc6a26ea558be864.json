REUTERS/Staff\n\nMarkets were bombarded from all sides: denials and counter-denials on the state of U.S.-China trade talks and the Brexit countdown, a Turkish military push into Syria and a blizzard of weak data stretching from Japan to France.\n\nAsia had managed a broadly positive finish but Europe\u2019s main bourses and Wall Street futures were left dithering [.EU] as the more serious action took place in the currency markets. [/FRX]\n\nThe euro EUR=EBS shot above $1.10 versus the dollar as the greenback turned weaker across the board .DXY - partly due to market chatter about a currency pact with China to stop devaluation - but there was plenty else too.\n\nThe Financial Times reported that the ECB had restarted its bond-buying program last month despite objections from its own officials, a further sign of how the move has reopened divisions within the institution. ECB meeting minutes then showed similar.\n\n\u201cThe view on the currency story could be swinging here,\u201d said Saxo Bank\u2019s head of European currency strategy, John Hardy, \u201cAnd the market is sensing that euro-dollar is the pressure point.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the main mover overnight though was a rally in China\u2019s offshore yuan, which strengthened to its best levels in more than two weeks after a Bloomberg report said U.S. and Chinese officials were reviving a currency pact first mooted earlier this year that stops further tariff hikes in return for commitments to hold the yuan stable.\n\nAs well as the ECB resistance to Draghi\u2019s moves, that could also have a read-across for the euro, Saxo\u2019s Hardy said, with the United States expected to lay out sanctions next week in retaliation for Europe\u2019s past aid for planemaker Airbus.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly flagged how the euro has been weakened by extreme measures such as negative interest rates, so he may effectively issue a \u201ccease and desist\u201d along with the sanctions, Hardy said.\n\nThere also was the Brexit tangle. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was meeting his Irish counterpart in a last-ditch attempt to revive a British proposal for a deal that the EU said falls far short of what is needed.\n\n\u201cBig picture - the more severe that Brexit is, in the short term, it\u2019s likely to lead to a lower value of the pound, a higher level of inflation and slower growth in the economy,\u201d Bank of England chief Mark Carney told reporters.\n\n\u2018DIRE\u2019 TRADE SITUATION\n\nS&P 500 mini futures ESc1 traded down 0.2%, though losses had been trimmed by a New York Times report that Washington would soon issue licenses allowing some U.S. firms to supply non-sensitive goods to China\u2019s Huawei Technologies.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS had closed 0.1% higher while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.45%. Shanghai shares .SSEC also rose 0.8%.\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators were scheduled to meet in Washington on Thursday and Friday to try to end a bruising 15-month-old trade war.\n\nWithout significant progress, Trump is set to raise the tariff rate on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods to 30% from 25% next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cBarring any surprise today, it looks like their talks are breaking down. The tariff will be hiked. The situation looks dire,\u201d said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.\n\nChina is unlikely to be willing to make an easy compromise with a U.S. president who seems increasingly vulnerable to domestic political pressure as opposition Democrats seek to impeach him, analysts said.\n\nU.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden called for the impeachment of Trump for the first time in a deepening partisan fight over a congressional investigation of the Republican president.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s recent impeachment risk has turned the timetable against him,\u201d Chi Lo, senior economist at BNP Paribas Asset in Hong Kong, wrote in a report to clients.\n\nU.S. Treasuries yield went flat having risen to 1.594% on Wednesday, pressured partly by this week\u2019s heavy bond supply.\n\nThe 10-year Treasuries yield had dipped to 1.577% US10YT=RR overnight, but had shuffled back up to 1.590 ahead of U.S. trading while all the ECB chatter also pushed euro zone yields slightly higher.\n\nIn commodities, oil prices also turned, with Brent bouncing between $52.82 and $58.23 a barrel and U.S. (WTI) crude CLc1 at $52.50 per barrel. Copper CMCU3 strained for its best day in a month as it rose 1.1% to $5,749 a tonne.\n\nAmong the heavyweight emerging markets, Turkey\u2019s lira and government bonds saw another day of falls as investors fretted about negative international reaction to Ankara\u2019s military operation in northeast Syria.\n\nFocus was also on the mood in Ecuador after another day of fierce protests against recent fuel price hikes had hammered its markets on Wednesday.", "description": "A dive in the dollar catapulted the euro higher and flattened stocks on Thursday as the first U.S.-China trade talks since July and a report accusing the European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi of going rogue jostled for attention.", "authors": ["Marc Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439201465&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990PN", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
