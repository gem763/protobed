The smells remind me of Spain which help me not to miss it as much lol I can't wait to be back in Majorca This Wednesday for my gig at @stadium63 #palmanova .\"\n\nArg is still expected to fly out to the Spanish island next week to perform, despite pals worrying his partying is spiralling out of control.\n\nA source close to the reality star's family told the newspaper: \"James' friends are beyond worried. Their concern is that if this behaviour keeps on happening that one day soon they will go around to find him dead.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"He has become more and more reclusive and his loved ones are worried about what is going on behind closed doors, away from watchful eyes.\"\n\nThe insider added: \"Gemma raised the alarm because after hearing from his mum and dad she thought the worst. When paramedics turned up and couldn't get in everyone was beside themselves.\"\n\nArg, who recently appeared in Celebrity Coach Trip with his TOWIE mate Diags, initially claimed the medics had been called to check over his dad Martin Argent while he and his parents were hanging pictures.\n\nHe then admitted he was \"embarrassed\" over the emergency but played down the seriousness.\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to a certain person so I didn't reply, he said.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\n\"They became concerned and called the police and ambulance.\n\n\"They turned up and checked on me. They came up to my room to make sure I was fine.\"\n\nHe went on: \"My parents were already there. Then this person must have called again and the ambulance turned up at around 4pm and we had a quick chat on the doorstep. He said it was a lovely house.\n\n\"I wasn't speaking to this person for a reason and they were worried about my safety because I wasn't answering the phone.\n\n\"I was perfectly fine, we all had a chat and carried on the day with my parents, we were just hanging up pictures.\"\n\n(Image: @thisisheart/Twitter)\n\nArg added: \u201cThe police and paramedics were only here for about ten minutes. I'm slightly embarrassed really. I apologise for any wasted police time as I was absolutely fine.\"\n\nHe said the police did not force their way into his home.\n\nIn a statement, Metropolitan Police said: \"Police were called at 13.11hrs to a residential address following concerns for the welfare of male occupant. Officers attended with LAS [London Ambulance Service]. The male, in his 30s, was spoken to. He was left in the company of family.\n\n\"Officers were called at 16.21hrs to the same address, again due to concerns for the same male's welfare. The male declined assistance.\"\n\nGemma is yet to speak publicly about her role in the incident.\n\nMirror Online has contacted Arg's rep for comment.", "description": "James 'Arg' Argent has spoken after his on/off girlfriend Gemma Collins and his parents raised concerns about his welfare", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Instagram", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Thisisheart Twitter"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658638.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_James-Argent.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
