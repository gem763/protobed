They repeatedly chanted \u201cLiberate Hong Kong\u201d as they waved a black version of the territory\u2019s Bauhinia flag, a symbol of resistance in the protests.\n\nMany Hongkongers say the singing lifts their spirits and boosts morale in their fight for democracy and basic rights. Some, tired of violent clashes in recent protests, said the singing was a powerful tool of solidarity and determination.\n\n\u201cThe song spells out our heartfelt feelings. It is a song that stands for our fight,\u201d said a 33-year-old man who gave his surname as Hung, who participated in singing at the football match and at a shopping centre on Wednesday.\n\nHung said singing was a good way of uniting supporters of the movement, on top of other non-violent expressions such as human chains and Lennon Walls \u2013 where people post sticky notes with pro-democracy messages \u2013 in communities across Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong activist's visit to Berlin draws anger from China Read more\n\n\u201cWhy are tears flowing on this land? Why are people angry? We lift our heads, we reject silence and we yearn for freedom with our resounding voices,\u201d said the opening verse.\n\nWords like \u201cfreedom\u201d, \u201cglory\u201d, \u201ccourage\u201d pepper the song, which finishes with a verse calling for democracy, justice and freedom and \u201ca return of glory to Hong Kong in this era of revolution\u201d \u2013 a slogan frequently used in the current wave of protests.\n\nLast Wednesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam belatedly announced the full withdrawal of a controversial extradition, which in June sparked the wave of demonstrations.\n\nThe withdrawal was one of five key demands of the demonstrators. She did not respond to protesters\u2019 other demands, which include an independent inquiry into police behaviour, amnesty for those arrested, and democratic reforms to give Hong Kong residents universal suffrage.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to give up. One demand has been met, but we don\u2019t want to give up on the rest, we have to persist,\u201d Hung said.", "description": "Thousands have gathered this week in a football match and at shopping centres across the city to sing in solidarity", "authors": ["Verna Yu"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f2809c3880103288d149f65e6bb26ade7b20932/0_263_5141_3086/master/5141.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e1d539234b883be48be0934deb87b669", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
