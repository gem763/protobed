REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticized House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not bringing his administration\u2019s re-negotiated trade deal with neighboring Mexico and Canada up for a vote in Congress.\n\nThe Republican president and his administration have been pressing for ratification since the three countries inked the deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in November 2018.\n\nThe new pact, the United States, Mexico, Canada Agreement (USMCA), must win approval in a divided Congress where Pelosi\u2019s fellow Democrats control the House and have said they have concerns over the agreement, including its labor and enforcement provisions.\n\nTrump administration officials have been pressing for a House vote before the end of November, although a key U.S. labor leader earlier this month said it would fail if it was voted on before the Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 28.\n\nNAFTA governs more than $1.2 trillion of mutual trade between the three countries, and Trump sees its replacement as key to his trade agenda with the U.S. economy looming large in his bid for re-election next year.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe that Nervous Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t moving faster on USMCA. Her people want it, they don\u2019t know why she isn\u2019t putting it up for a bipartisan vote. Taking too long!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nRepresentatives for Pelosi could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nPelosi last week said lawmakers were getting closer to a consensus with administration officials over the pact. Her comments came one day after her heated exchange with Trump at the White House in which she criticized the president for having a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d Trump, in turn, reportedly called her a \u201cthird rate politician.\u201d", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday criticized House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for not bringing his administration's re-negotiated trade deal with neighboring Mexico and Canada up for a vote in Congress.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443744965&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L14S", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
