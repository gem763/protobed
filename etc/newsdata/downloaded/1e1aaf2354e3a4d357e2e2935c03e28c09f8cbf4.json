People cowered in shopping centers and supermarkets and black plumes of smoke rose across the skyline.\n\nChaos continued into the night after a large group of inmates also escaped from the city prison.\n\nOn Friday, cars navigated burnt out vehicles that partially blocked streets.\n\nGladys McCormick, a security analyst at Syracuse University in the United States, said the latest news from Mexico read like that of a country in \u201cthe throes of war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is incontrovertible is that the Sinaloa Cartel won yesterday\u2019s battle,\u201d she added. \u201cNot only did they get the government to release Ovidio, they demonstrated to the citizens of Culiacan as well as the rest of Mexico who is in control.\u201d\n\nDurazo said the government\u2019s decision to free Guzman \u201cinvolved absolutely no negotiation.\u201d\n\nStill, questions about how the release was handled continued circulating after defense minister Sandoval said nine security personnel were \u201cheld and freed without injury.\u201d\n\nMexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador holds his daily news conference in Oaxaca, Mexico October 18, 2019.

Under the previous administration, security forces captured him twice in Sinaloa, in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe previous government extradited him to the United States on the eve of Trump\u2019s accession. He was found guilty in a U.S. court in February of smuggling tons of drugs and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an indictment against Ovidio and one of his brothers in February, charging them with conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration declined to comment.", "description": "Mexican officials on Friday admitted they had bungled the arrest of kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman's son, who they let go during shootouts with drug gangs in the streets of a major city, but the president insisted his security strategy was working.", "authors": ["Dave Graham", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442407253&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1F8", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
