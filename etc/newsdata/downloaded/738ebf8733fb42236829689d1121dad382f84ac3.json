The self-titled \"Teal\" album features the band's members dressed like the cast of Miami Vice circa 1985, and much of the collection plays like an ode to '80s kitsch, including Weezer's cult-favorite cover of Toto's unstoppable hit \"Africa.\" But the album also includes some surprising covers, including a version of Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid,\" TLC's \"No Scrubs\" and Ben E. King's \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nEnlarge this image Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist\n\nMuch like Weezer's by-the-book recreation of \"Africa,\" the songs on the \"Teal\" album are nearly identical versions of the originals \u2014 Rivers Cuomo's voice is about the only indication that you're not listening to the actual bands that first penned the tracks. Guitarist Brian Bell takes lead vocals on \"Paranoid\" and does his best Ozzy Osbourne impression.\n\nThe surprise drop comes ahead of Weezer's upcoming \"Black\" album, due out March 1 on Atlantic Records.", "description": "The self-titled \"Teal\" album includes the band's cult-favorite cover of Toto's \"Africa,\" along with other '80s hits like \"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\" and \"Sweet Dreams.\"", "authors": ["Robin Hilton"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/24/weezerteal_wide-9c1670f38f13e69751deff9c84315ce3a5dfb003.jpg?s=1400"}
