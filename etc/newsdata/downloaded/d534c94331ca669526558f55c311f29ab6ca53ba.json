By preventing trans women from competing or requiring them to take medication, you\u2019re denying their human rights.\u201d\n\nMs. McKinnon\u2019s repeated wins against women have sparked a spirited debate about the future of gender-segregated sports. Some feminists argue the transgender movement is slowly eroding women\u2019s foothold in the industry.\n\nFormer cycling champion Victoria Hood told Sky News that she thinks it\u2019s unfair for transgender women to have an upper hand on cisgender women because of their biological makeup.\n\n\u201cThe male body, which has been through male puberty, still retains its advantage, that doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d she said. \u201cI have sympathy with [trans athletes]. They have a right to do sport but not a right to go into any category they want.\u201d\n\nEven President Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., weighed in on Ms. McKinnon\u2019s win on Monday, tweeting, \u201cYou can never be woke enough! Sorry to all female athletes who spent their lives mastering their games.\u201d\n\nMs. McKinnon responded to the backlash on Twitter, saying she has the science to back up her position.\n\n\u201cMany people claim to support trans women,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut often they only support us until our lives impact them in any meaningful way. In my case, people literally say they support trans women \u2026 but not in sport. There can be no \u2018but.\u2019 We are either full and equal women, or not. We are.\n\n\u201cAnd babes, facts don\u2019t care about your feelings: medical professionals (WHO, AMA), mental health practitioners (both APA\u2019s), and sport (IOC) all say that trans women are *real* women, are really female. Cry about it all you want. Your feelings won\u2019t change the facts that we are,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to change *your* misguided opinion on the matter. You *don\u2019t* matter. Sorry. You don\u2019t. Everyone who *does* matter already says we\u2019re real women, really female.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
