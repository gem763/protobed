He had been stabbed repeatedly and investigators say he was even stabbed after he was dead.\n\n\"He was stabbed over 40 times,\" Howard's stepmother, Carol Pilmar, tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger. \"It had to be somebody he knew, that hated him so much.\"\n\nWho would want him dead so badly \u2013 and why? NYPD detectives couldn't find someone with the kind of hatred that would lead to murder \u2013 until they discovered surprises about Howard's wife, Roslyn, and her brother, Evan Wald.\n\nPolice learned Roslyn was in trouble with a former employer. \"She had embezzled \u2013 a large sum of money,\" says former NYPD Detective Commander Roger Parrino. And when detectives interviewed Wald, he had cuts on his left hand that he said he got them when he was working at Howard's coffee business.\n\n\"Did they look suspicious to you, given that this was a stabbing?\" Schlesinger asks Parrino. \"So, the cuts don't look suspicious. The individual starts lookin' suspicious,\" he replies.\n\nIt was beginning to look like Howard's murder could be a family affair, but prosecutors didn't believe there was enough evidence to charge anyone with the murder.\n\n\"Years went by,\" says Carol Pilmar. \"They never found the weapon. And they never had a witness.\"\n\nThe case then went cold until NYPD cold case investigators and Manhattan prosecutors spent four years reviewing the evidence and finding new witnesses \u2013 including the family's former nanny who, two decades later, finally revealed what she knew about the night of the murder.\n\nMARCH 22, 1996\n\nRon Tucker: It was Friday, March 22nd. \u2026 I was in the greatest mood, blue sky, bright sunshine \u2026 It was the first day you feel like spring is coming. \u2026 I was feeling great.\n\nBut Ron Tucker's mood, his day and his life were about to change. Because on that beautiful morning in 1996 \u2013 when the King Office Supply salesman arrived at work \u2013 he learned his boss, Howard Pilmar, had been murdered in the office.\n\nRon Tucker [in front of the King store]: Within 30 seconds of coming here, they brought the body out right here.\n\nRon Tucker: I couldn't, I'm racking my brain, what happened?\n\nHoward Pilmar's body was found in a large pool of blood in the fourth-floor offices.\n\nRoger Parrino | Former NYPD Detective Commander: It was bloody, because after he's on the floor for a few hours, he's draining out.\n\nRoger Parrino was in charge of the Midtown South detectives. Pilmar was stabbed repeatedly in the chest, back and neck. There was no sign of forced entry, nothing was taken from the office or from his wallet.\n\nRoger Parrino: We gotta get down to business. We don't know what we have here.\n\nHoward Pilmar Heather Pilmar\n\nHoward had just turned 40; he was married and the father of a young son. He had recently taken over his family's successful office supply store so his father Frank and stepmother Carol could spend more time in Arizona. That's where they got the news.\n\nFrank Pilmar: Howard's dead. Couldn't believe it.\n\nRon Tucker: Howard was a swaggering \u2026 risk taker. \u2026 He was a visionary.\n\nHoward envisioned that people would go crazy for coffee and be willing to spend big for it. So, he opened the first-of-its-kind high-end coffee bar inside a store.\n\nRon Tucker [standing outside the business]: I'm telling you there were a line of people \u2026 Out the door. Right here. A line of people.\n\nHe named it \"Philip's\" after his young son. It was so successful he opened a second shop around the corner from Carnegie Hall. His wife, Roslyn, gave up her career as a dental hygienist to run the coffee business. And on that March morning, after the murder, Roslyn joined the employees gathered inside King Office Supply \u2026 putting on a brave face.\n\nRon Tucker: She was totally calm, composed, collected \u2026 No tears, no anger, no nothing. \u2026 I thought to myself, \"what a trooper.\"\n\nShe assured everyone, the business would endure.\n\nRon Tucker: \"Don't worry. \u2026 we're going to carry on. We're gonna keep the business.\"\n\nJanna Wald: It's almost like it wasn't real. Her husband was dead. Her best friend.\n\nRoslyn's sister Janna says Howard and Roslyn were high school sweethearts.\n\nJanna Wald: They had a great love.\n\nThey married in 1982. Howard's sister, Rhonda, was there.\n\nRhonda Pilmar Cooper: it was a beautiful wedding. It was a big beautiful wedding.\n\nSo was his stepsister Heather. Frank adopted Heather when he married her mother Carol.\n\nHeather Pilmar: Roz was like a sister to me \u2026 she was probably one of my closest friends.\n\nRoslyn and Howard were living the life. An apartment on New York's swanky Upper East Side, a home in the country, and, in 1986, their son Philip was born.\n\nRhonda Pilmar Cooper: It was the perfect family. \u2026 as passionate Howard was about business, that's how he was about his son.\n\nNow, Howard's life was over.\n\nRhonda Pilmar Cooper: It's as if someone punches you in the stomach as hard as they could and knocks the wind out of you. \u2026 I couldn't take a deep breath.\n\nHeather Pilmar: I have my life before Howard was killed and my life after Howard was killed. \u2026 They didn't really understand the ramifications of it \u2026 How it would change my father \u2026 How it would change the dynamic of my family.\n\nThe police now needed to learn all about Howard's family and his friends and his business.\n\nRoger Parrino: Who's the last one to see him? Who's the last one to talk to him? Who's related to him? Who's worked with him? Who shoulda been here? Who was here? Who first sees him? Who's coming next?\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Who were the last people to see Howard Pilmar?\n\nRoger Parrino: it was his wife and his brother-in-law.\n\nParrino went to the Pilmar's apartment to talk to Roslyn.\n\nRoger Parrino: She seemed cooperative, helpful.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What'd you talk to her about?\n\nRoger Parrino: Oh, just normal things. \u2026 how was her marriage? \u2026 She said that they were happily married.\n\nAccording to Roslyn, on the night of the murder, she and her brother, Evan Wald \u2013 who worked at Philip's Coffee \u2013 met Howard at his office. Roslyn told police that she and Evan left Howard \u2013 who planned to keep working and watch a basketball game. But later that night when Howard didn't come home, Roslyn left this voicemail on his office phone:\n\nROSLYN PILMAR'S VOICEMAIL: Hi How, it's, um, like a quarter to 10\u2026 Philip and I were wondering if were still at work, working, or if you went off to some sports bar like you said you wanted to, to go watch the NCAAs \u2026 I'm sure you'll call me from where you are, and, um, talk to you later. Bye, love ya.\"\n\nWorried wife or alibi? Listen to Roslyn Pilmar\u2019s voicemail to her husband\n\nHoward never called back, but Roslyn made a lot of calls asking about him \u2013 including in the early morning hours \u2013 to several hospitals.\n\nPolice had a lot to sift through.\n\nRoger Parrino: In interviewing all those people and talking to all those people \u2026 you just take the facts \u2026 where they, where they lead you.\n\nParrino's detectives heard stories about disgruntled employees. Could one of them be the killer? There were rumors that Howard was a womanizer. Could it be a jealous husband?\n\nRoger Parrino: Lots of people have motives. You gotta have more than just a motive. There's gotta be a reason. \u2026 and then you have to have access.\n\nAnd whoever did it would also have to have a lot of anger. Howard had been stabbed 48 times. It was, in a word, overkill.\n\nRoger Parrino: A good percentage of the stab wounds on the back were all postmortem.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: After he was dead?\n\nRoger Parrino: Yeah, after he was dead. \u2026 This is, I want to make sure you're dead, absolutely dead, completely and utterly dead.\n\nHoward Pilmar had been stabbed 48 times. Investigators say he was even stabbed after he was dead. Manhattan D.A.'s Office\n\nThere were some leads that looked promising early on. When detectives interviewed Roslyn's brother, Evan, they noticed something.\n\nRoger Parrino: He had an injury on his hand.\n\nHe had cuts on his left hand. He said he got them when he was working at Philip's Coffee.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did they look suspicious to you, given that this was a stabbing?\n\nRoger Parrino: So, the cuts don't look suspicious. The individual starts lookin' suspicious.\n\nThey thought it could be suspicious when they learned Evan and Howard did not get along \u2013 and there was more.\n\nRoger Parrino: We found out that Evan was asking questions about what he thought was a camera, asking questions about the alarm system.\n\nAnd there were also one or two surprises about Roslyn.\n\nRoger Parrino: We find out that Roz and Howard marriage is not successful and she was giving us a different image.\n\nIt was beginning to look like Howard's murder could be a family affair.\n\nJanna Wald: It was mind blowing. It was like, \"no way.\"\n\nQUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR?\n\nFrank Pilmar: I'm telling you, on the way to the cemetery I knew that something was wrong.\n\nFrank Pilmar knew, now that Howard was dead, that Roslyn could make out really well.\n\nShe's the one who would get more than a million dollars in life insurance, the family's real estate, and King Office Supply \u2013 the company that Frank Pilmar had built and passed on to his son.\n\nFrank Pilmar: Here I gave up the business. She's got it. \u2026 I just couldn't even look at her.\n\nAnd Roslyn appeared to be moving quickly. Less than two weeks after Howard was killed, she went to King Office Supply and despite what she had said just 10 days earlier, she announced she was selling the company.\n\nRon Tucker: I was shocked at that.\n\nRon Tucker says when she should have been grieving over all she'd lost, Roslyn had been negotiating over how much she'd get for the business.\n\nRon Tucker: It's inconceivable that you would do that instead of mourn. And right then and there, I started to \u2026 question her motives.\n\nRoslyn Pilmar Heather Pilmar\n\nPolice also had questions about Roslyn, and they were starting to see why she might have needed money \u2013 and fast.\n\nRoger Parrino: I think when we find out about the financial issues \u2026 she's not quite what we originally thought we were looking at here.\n\nFor 16 years Roslyn worked for a dentist, Dr. Stanley Weinstock. She was his dental assistant and also his bookkeeper. The police found out she embezzled money from her boss \u2013 and a lot of it: hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nNeal Klein: It was like a family member \u2026 stealing from you.\n\nNobody noticed until after she left to manage Philip's Coffee. That's when the dentist and his accountant, Neal Klein, discovered Roslyn had deposited 186 patients' checks into her own bank account.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: How long had she been doing this?\n\nNeal Klein: About three or four years.\n\nKlein confronted her in late 1995, just a few months before Howard's murder.\n\nNeal Klein: She just said, \"Yes, I took the money.\" \u2026 and she said, \"Don't tell my husband.\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: She said that?\n\nNeal Klein: Yes \u2026 \"He'll throw me out and I'll never see my son again.\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What did you make of that?\n\nNeal Klein: That was pretty shocking.\n\nKlein agreed to keep her secret and Roslyn agreed to repay the money.\n\nNeal Klein: Weeks go by and I called her several times. And, \"It's happening, it's happening, it's happening.\" But, of course, it didn't happen.\n\nAnd Roslyn owed even more money. She was supposed to pay the taxes for the coffee shop, but she didn't. And she owed New York State almost $15,000. The state was threatening to seize the business if the taxes weren't paid.\n\nCarol Pilmar: All this started to add up, give reason for the murder. I mean, she was desperate for money. \u2026 She was afraid if he found out, he would divorce her \u2026 She didn't want to lose Philip. \u2026 here's a woman who's an embezzler. She's a tax cheater. She's not fit to be a mother.\n\nRoslyn didn't talk about her problems. But Heather noticed Roslyn seemed jittery in the weeks before the murder.\n\nHeather Pilmar: She seemed really stressed out. \u2026 And I did ask her, you know, \"Is everything OK?\" 'cause she, like, lost a lot of weight. \u2026 she was like, \"No, I'm fine. I'm fine.\"\n\nHeather didn't bring it up again, but she did ask Evan about his sister.\n\nHeather Pilmar: He said to me \u2026 \"If Howard hurts her in any way\" \u2013 and I was like, \"What do you mean?\" \u2026 \"If he hurt her I would kill him.\" And I said, \"What?\"\n\nRichard Schlesinger: He said \u2013\n\nHeather Pilmar: Yes.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: \u2013 \"If he hurts her, I will kill him\"?\n\nHeather Pilmar: Yeah.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Well, I mean, at that point did you think that Evan was capable of murder?\n\nHeather Pilmar: No.\n\nBut the next night, Howard was murdered.\n\nHeather Pilmar: I had immediately thought that Evan did it. I had, like, a pit in my stomach.\n\nHeather had a more difficult time believing Roslyn was involved.\n\nHeather Pilmar: I still couldn't believe that this person, that I've known most of my life, could do something like this.\n\nEven though there was no physical evidence, her father never had a doubt.\n\nFrank Pilmar: Any time I've met anyone going back all these years who've asked me about who did this, I said, \"his wife and her brother.\"\n\nFrank and Carol Pilmar say they never doubted who was responsible for Howard's murder. CBS News\n\nRoslyn knew what Frank thought and decided he, Carol and Heather could never speak to her or Philip again. His family was split apart, but right from the start, Frank decided he was not going to let his son's killers get away with it.\n\nRoger Parrino: He would spend lots of times coming to the precinct or call \u2013 even calling my supervisors, telling them we need to [laughs] do a better job.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: So, you would call them, what? Once a week? Once a month?\n\nFrank Pilmar: Maybe once a day, maybe once every other day.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you ever hear from Roslyn? She ever call asking what was going on?\n\nRoger Parrino: No.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Never?\n\nWhile Roslyn didn't seem interested in the police, they stayed interested in her and her family. About a year later, detectives put up posters asking the public for help in solving the case. And the posters kept disappearing.\n\nRoger Parrino: We set up a surveillance van to see what was happenin' \u2026 And then who is it? It's Evan. Evan tearin' down the posters.\n\nPolice set up surveillance after posters seeking info about NYC murder go missing\n\nThat woman with him \u2013 that's Janna \u2013 Roslyn and Evan's sister.\n\nJanna Wald: They just kept plastering them all over the doors of the business. I found it extremely harassing.\n\nRoger Parrino: I'm sorry that in an investigation to solve their brother-in-law or husband's murder that they thought it was harassment to try to get more information.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You're not really sorry.\n\nRoger Parrino: No.\n\nAbout a year after the murder, Roslyn was arrested, but only for embezzling from the dentist. She pleaded guilty and was given probation after paying back the money she stole.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Where'd she get the money to pay?\n\nRoger Parrino: The insurance policy and the sale of the business, I believe.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: That tell you anything?\n\nRoger Parrino: Yeah, it's all part of the motive.\n\nRoger Parrino: It's a circumstantial case, and it's kinda like a bucket of water, right? So, every drop fills that bucket, and it's not until that bucket's full is it ready to go.\n\nAnd in 1999, it looked like new evidence would start pouring in. DNA technology had advanced and the court ordered Evan Wald to give a sample of his blood. It was a match to a small drop of blood found near Howard's body.\n\nThis small drop of blood on the wall found near Howard's body was a DNA match to Evan Wald. Manhattan D.A.'s Office\n\nRoger Parrino: Puts him on the scene, puts him in the place.\n\nIt was one crucial piece of physical evidence, but it was not enough for prosecutors and the case went cold.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did you despair?\n\nFrank Pilmar: I don't think I ever despaired. No. \u2026 She did.\n\nCarol Pilmar: I didn't want to get his hopes up and then you know \u2013\n\nFrank Pilmar: She thought I was nuts.\n\nBut Frank refused to give up.\n\nFrank Pilmar: I remember feeling that the something good was going to come of this because I was getting too old for it not to happen.\n\nA NEW LOOK AT THE CASE\n\nOver the decades, Roslyn Pilmar and Evan Wald moved on with their lives. Their sister Janna says Roslyn returned to being a hygienist.\n\nJanna Wald: She worked like everybody else does. You work, make a paycheck. You pay your bills. She raised an amazing son.\n\nPhilip went to private school, then on to college and law school. He eventually joined a top firm and got married.\n\nEvan got married and continued his career in the food industry.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: There wasn't a shadow over your brother and sister? They didn't feel like they had to look over their shoulders?\n\nJanna Wald: Why should you look over your shoulder when you're innocent?\n\nBut what they didn't know was Manhattan prosecutors Elizabeth Lederer and Melissa Hindman had spent four years reviewing all the evidence and finding new witnesses. On August 15, 2017, Janna Wald received a panicked early morning call from Evan's wife.\n\nJanna Wald: \"Evan just got arrested\" and I said, \u2026 \"for what?\" \"Howard's murder.\" I was like, \"are you kidding me?\"\n\nJanna barely hung up the phone when it rang again. And this time it was about Roslyn.\n\nJanna Wald: My sister was arrested \u2026 and all I did was break down and cry.\n\nOn August 15, 2017, Evan Wald, left, and his sister, Roslyn Pilmar, were arrested and charged in the 1996 murder of Roslyn's husband Howard. John M. Mantel, Daily Mail/Steve Hirsch\n\nJanna is just as certain today as she was when Howard Pilmar was murdered that her siblings are innocent.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: I think people listening to you may say, \"She's a very good sister. She's devoted. But she can't accept what's staring her in the face.\"\n\nJanna Wald: I don't think that's correct. \u2026 I'm sorry. Even being biased \u2026 and I love my family, but they're just not capable. These are not killers.\n\nFrank and Carol Pilmar, not surprisingly, reacted to the arrest somewhat differently.\n\nFrank Pilmar: We all hugged.\n\nCarol Pilmar: \u2013 and cried.\n\nFrank Pilmar: I didn't really expect her to be arrested as well.\n\nFrank immediately called his daughters in New York.\n\nRhonda Pilmar Cooper: I remember my heart \u2013 I couldn't control myself, my heart was pounding so. It was unbelievable.\n\nHeather Pilmar: You've known for all these years that at some point something's going to happen \u2026 I was kind of shaking inside.\n\nRoslyn and Evan were held without bail.\n\nHeather Pilmar: That was a very big day for us.\n\nRoslyn Pilmar and her brother Evan Wald at their bail hearing. John M. Mantel/Daily Mail\n\nBut it was a very bad day for the Walds, especially when they visited Roslyn and Evan behind bars.\n\nJanna Wald: I've never felt so broken in my life.\n\nDaniel Gotlin: I went through all the evidence and there wasn't a shred, a scintilla of new evidence against Evan Wald.\n\nDaniel Gotlin is Evan's attorney.\n\nDaniel Gotlin: Bring me the evidence \u2026 you will find there's nothing, zero.\n\nNow, the defense has to deal with a case that's more than 20 years old. Roslyn's lawyer is Sam Talkin.\n\nSam Talkin: There are witnesses that passed away. We don't have opportunity to canvass the neighborhood. We don't have an opportunity to talk individually and conduct our own investigation.\n\nThey will have to explain that drop of Evan's blood at the crime scene. Evan's family and his lawyer reminded everyone that Evan worked in the food business \u2013 in kitchens where people frequently cut themselves and that he sometimes prepared meals at Howard's office.\n\nDan Gotlin: There's no way of telling when that blood was put there.\n\nOf course, there is also the hundreds of thousands of dollars Roslyn embezzled from the dentist. Roslyn's sister Janna Wald says Roslyn did a bad thing, but for a good reason. Their mother was having difficulty paying the mortgage.\n\nJanna Wald: I guess my sister felt that she wanted to help her.\n\nSo why did Roslyn keep it a secret from Howard? Janna says that's simple: she didn't.\n\nJanna Wald says the reason Roslyn embezzled money was to help their mother. CBS News\n\nJanna Wald: Howard knew what Roslyn had done.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: He did know?\n\nJanna Wald: Absolutely. \u2026 My sister told me.\n\nJanna Wald: I'm sure Howard was not jumping up and down for joy. But it was something that they could work out.\n\nRoger Parrino: My belief is that he wouldn't have known, unless he knew moments before he was killed.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Wow, that's chilling.\n\nThe Wald family believed the police focused solely on Evan and Roslyn and ignored other possible suspects.\n\nDan Gotlin: There were other people that may have had a motive. \u2026 I found multiple people that didn't like the deceased \u2026. some of them had made threats.\n\nRoger Parrino: In interviewing all those people \u2026 there was nothing that came out \u2026 so it's following the evidence \u2026 and it's going nowhere but right back to Roslyn and Evan.\n\nA KEY WITNESS EMERGES\n\nOn January 17, almost 23 years after Howard Pilmar's murder, his wife, Roslyn and brother-in-law Evan, went on trial for killing him.\n\nCarol Pilmar: There was some kind of satisfaction seeing them in handcuffs.\n\nFrank and Carol Pilmar came from Arizona, and for the first time in decades they came face to face with their former daughter-in-law and their grandson, Philip.\n\nFrank Pilmar: I saw him. And he looked exactly like Howard. One face, you knew, that this kid was Howard's kid. They are one face.\n\nBut they never spoke.\n\nSam Talkin | Roslyn Pilmar's defense attorney: It's as divided as that aisle in between. There was our side. And there was their side. And it was that simple.\n\nBoth sides sat through graphic evidence about the gruesome killing:\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: Roslyn Pilmar and Evan Walt savagely and brutally murdered Howard Pilmar. PROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: Their plan was deliberate and detailed. It was meticulously carried out.\n\nThe evidence was mostly circumstantial. But Evan's lawyer Dan Gotlin was worried. There was that drop of Evan's blood at the crime scene. It is the only physical evidence that could tie him to the murder.\n\nDAN GOTLIN | EVAN WALD'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY [in court]: Clearly, it's Evan's blood. We don't dispute that.\n\nGotlin says there's no way to know when the blood drop got there, but investigators noticed that injury to Evan's hand the day after the murder.\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: His left hand, because he is left handed, held the knife. \u2026 Maybe as Howard bled the knife handle became slippery. We won't know for sure, but all we do know is that Evan cut himself and bled at the scene where he killed Howard Pilmar.\n\nThe knife was never found, and police waited a week to photograph Evan's hand.\n\nWhen detectives interviewed Evan Wald, he had cuts on his left hand that he said he got them when he was working at Howard Pilmar's coffee business. Manhattan D.A.'s Office\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: And if you look at those photographs \u2026 It's not just one cut. It's a number of cuts.\n\nBut the defense insists Evan cut himself while working the day before the murder.\n\nDAN GOTLIN | EVAN WALD'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY [in court]: He said, \"I was at an event and at the event a plate dropped. And I cleaned it up and I cut my hand.\" \u2026 That's why he was wearing a Band-Aid.\n\nExcept the prosecution had Heather's testimony that she saw Evan the night before the murder, and he seemed fine.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Did he have any cuts on his hands?\n\nHeather Pilmar: No, he did not. He only had coffee grinds under his fingernails the way I did. \u2026 There were no bandages on his hands.\n\nBut Gotlin hopes the jury will wonder if this drop of Evan's blood got there when Howard was murdered, why it wasn't mixed with Howard's blood.\n\nDan Gotlin: If he's stabbing him and Howard's bleeding, blood should have gotten all over him.\n\nAnd Evan's blood was not found anywhere else.\n\nDan Gotlin: There was no blood found of him in the bathroom, where he supposedly went to clean up \u2026 None of his blood found anywhere near the crime scene. There's no blood of his found on the stairwell going down into the street. In fact, there's no blood found in the street.\n\nAnd what will jurors think about Heather's account of her conversation with Evan the night before the murder, where she says he told her if Howard hurt Roslyn, he would kill him.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: That's not a good thing to have to explain, especially when your client shows up with cuts on his hands.\n\nDan Gotlin: Would I have preferred that there were no cuts on his hand, that there was no blood on the wall, or he hadn't made any statements? Yes. Because, then, even though I love speaking to you, I wouldn't be speaking to you because there wouldn't have been any case.\n\nBut the case against Roslyn was all circumstantial. Even though her family says she was happily married to Howard, the prosecution says Howard had met with a divorce lawyer and all the while Roslyn was facing mounting pressure to pay back her crushing debts.\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: She had to find money and she had to find it quickly.\n\nShe owed all that money she embezzled from the dentist.\n\nSam Talkin | Roslyn Pilmar's defense attorney: We had the debt from the dentist. But it wasn't due.\n\nThat's not what Neal Klein says. The dentist's accountant remembers leaning on Roslyn for the money in the weeks leading up to Howard's murder.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Were you saying to her \"we need the money?\"\n\nNeal Klein: Yeah.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: \"We need it soon.\"\n\nNeal Klein: Yeah. \u2026 I was putting a little more pressure on her, yes.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You don't strike me as a kneecapping kind of guy \u2026 So how were you turning up the pressure on her?\n\nNeal Klein: Just said, \"Roz, this can't go on much longer. \u2026 If you're not going to make payment then we're going to have to go further.\"\n\nAt the same time New York State was demanding the back taxes for Philip's Coffee:\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: And if she doesn't pay by certified check on that day, they'll file a lien. They'll padlock the store.\n\nThe due date \u2013 March 21 \u2013 the same day Howard was murdered.\n\nSam Talkin: Needing money does not mean that you're going to kill your husband. \u2026 Killing your husband doesn't mean it's going to resolve the need for money.\n\nEvan and Roslyn both decided not to testify. But the jurors heard Roslyn on the message she left on Howard's voicemail.\n\nWorried wife or alibi? Listen to Roslyn Pilmar\u2019s voicemail to her husband\n\nROSLYN PILMAR VOICEMAIL: Hi How, it's, um, like a quarter to 10 and um, Philip and I were wondering if you were still at work, working \u2026\n\nSam Talkin: If you listen to it, and I've listened to it a thousand times, that is clearly a woman who is looking for her husband and is worried.\n\nBut not everyone hears it the same way.\n\nROSLYN PILMAR VOICEMAIL: Anyway, I got home I guess by like uh 8:10\u2026 8:15 and Roseman called about 8\u2026 8:30 he was still at the office. I told him to try to call you. \u2026 Talk to you later. Bye, love ya.\n\nRoger Parrino: I hear a timeline being put down for the police's benefit.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Really?\n\nRoger Parrino: Yeah. It's just too contrived, too drawn out.\n\nAnd the state has a witness who's relatively new to the case: Allyson Lewis, who in 1996 was Philip's nanny. Just out of college, she didn't want to talk to police back then.\n\nRoger Parrino: I think when you consider the fact that \u2026 this was the person who was paying her and employing her, and perhaps as she matured and got older, she realized that she had somethin' that she could share.\n\nShe now says on the night of the murder, she took Philip to ice hockey practice because Roslyn and Evan planned to meet with Howard:\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: She said that Roslyn Pilmar was very vague in her instructions to her. That was very different than she usually was.\n\nAllyson says Roslyn later told her to take Philip home after practice, because she was still at Howard's office:\n\nPROSECUTOR ELIZABETH LEDERER [in court]: She said, \"we're not done here.\" \u2026Those words are chilling, ladies and gentlemen. \u2026 And you know that she's at the fourth floor, the King Office Company with Howard Pilmar and her brother.\n\nAnd when Allyson and Philip finally arrived home, Roslyn met them at the door. She had wet hair. Allyson said it was odd \u2013 the apartment was dark. And Roslyn didn't want her to come in.\n\nJanna Wald: I'm sorry, but I do not believe a single word that came out of her mouth.\n\nRoslyn's sister Janna says there's no one to corroborate Allyson Lewis' testimony.\n\nJanna Wald: I'm still very dismayed by the fact that she was so adamant about not wanting to talk to the police and then 20 years later was so willing to talk.\n\nThe trial lasted almost two months and then the jury got the case. And from their first vote, the jurors knew their job would be tough.\n\nSam Resnicow | Juror: Listen, things got pretty heated at times.\n\nTHE LONG WAIT FOR JUSTICE\n\nSam Talkin: I was feeling very nervous. \u2026 if you're not nervous when the jury goes out, you're not alive.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: By the second day were you coming together? Were the votes getting closer?\n\nSam Resnicow: I don't think so.\n\nRyan Smith | Juror: No \u2026 We had two staunch holdouts.\n\nSam Talkin: I think in a case like this the longer the better.\n\nBy the fourth day of jury deliberations, defense attorney Sam Talkin was starting to feel optimistic.\n\nSam Talkin: We're asking them to think and they were thinking. So yes, I think that was a good sign.\n\nThat afternoon, the jury came back.\n\nHeather Pilmar: My father was in the courtroom \u2026 on the other side Philip was there with Roz's family.\n\nCameras were not allowed in the courtroom for the verdict.\n\nCarol Pilmar: We sat down and I'm holding his hand.\n\nFrank Pilmar: I was scared. I was scared.\n\nCarol Pilmar: And I was like crying inside.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What were you worried about? What were you scared of?\n\nCarol Pilmar: That he'd drop dead.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: Literally.\n\nCarol Pilmar: Yeah. I thought he'd collapse.\n\nRyan Smith: We're lining up and it was at that moment that the entire room tensed up.\n\nRyan Smith, Sam Resnicow and the other jurors prepared themselves to deliver their verdict and headed for the courtroom.\n\nRyan Smith: We walked in. And it was super quiet, and you could just feel the room vibrating.\n\nSmith was the jury foreman. He announced the verdict.\n\nRyan Smith: Roz was first.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: And that was what?\n\nRyan Smith: Guilty.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: And the second was Evan's verdict. And that was?\n\nRyan Smith: Guilty.\n\nJurors from Howard Pilmar\u2019s murder trial had difficulty reaching verdict\n\nBoth guilty of second-degree murder. After nearly 23 years, it was almost as though the word echoed through the courtroom.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: When you heard the verdict \u2013\n\nCarol Pilmar: Frank didn't hear it.\n\nHeather Pilmar: My father couldn't hear a word.\n\nCarol Pilmar: I screamed in his ear.\n\nHeather Pilmar: Guilty!\n\nCarol Pilmar: Guilty!\n\nHeather Pilmar: Guilty!\n\nCarol Pilmar: Guilty!\n\nFrank Pilmar: It was like euphoria. I was so happy. \u2026 Both of us were hugging and crying.\n\nWhen Philip heard his mother had been convicted of killing his father, he ran out of the room.\n\nJanna Wald: We were all shocked by the verdict. \u2026 I felt so numb, I can't even begin to describe the pain, the heartbreak.\n\nBoth families had to wait for four months to find out how much time Roslyn and Evan would serve.\n\nIn July 2019, family, friends, lawyers and detectives crowded into the courtroom for the sentencing hearing.\n\nPhilip Pilmar was there alongside Roslyn and Evan's sister.\n\nBut before Roslyn and Evan hear their sentences, they will have to hear family members tell Judge Gilbert Hong what Howard's murder had done to them.\n\nCAROL PILMAR [in court]: March 22, 1996 was the worst day of my life. \u2026 Sorry, to bury a child \u2013 in my case a stepson \u2013 our lives have never been the same and never will be. I implore you to give these murderers the maximum sentence.\n\nCarol Pilmar: I want them to suffer.\n\nRichard Schlesinger: You want them to suffer.\n\nCarol Pilmar: Yes.\n\nFrank Pilmar: It's not that I want them to suffer. They've got to pay the price. You just don't go killing people.\n\nFrank was next.\n\nFRANK PILMAR [in court]: You know, Your Honor, every night when I go to bed, I try to close my eyes before hoping that I will get some sleep. But I can't get sleep, because I keep thinking about the terror and the fear that went through Howard's mind in those last seconds that he was slaughtered and butchered by those two.\n\nThen, Frank turned to his grandson.They have not spoken for more than two decades.\n\nFRANK PILMAR [in court]: I'm going to direct this to Philip\u2026 FRANK PILMAR [in court]: That day in March I lost three things, two of which I can never ever get back: my son and my business \u2026 But I also lost Philip and I know Philip doesn't want to look at me. I'm sorry about that. But I just want him to know \u2026 we love you and we want you back. Please. That's it your honor.\n\nFrank Pilmar [outside courtroom]: I was hoping that he would come and reciprocate and hold me around and hug me.\n\nBut that never happened.\n\nPhilip did not speak to his grandfather, but he did speak to the court. He asked the judge to order \"48 Hours\" to cut off the audio. These are the words of a son trying valiantly to save his mother from spending the rest of her life in prison:\n\nPhilip Pilmar [in court]: Having my mom die in jail will not bring back my dad \u2026\n\nAs his uncle and mother wept, Philip credited her for making him the man he is today:\n\nPhilip Pilmar [in court]: She raised me to be kind, to be loving, to value education, value hard work. She was there for me every step of the way when I struggled with the death of my dad.\n\nHe asked the judge for leniency. But it didn't work:\n\nJUDGE GILBERT HONG: This was an exceptionally brutal and violent murder \u2026 it's violence and brutality reveal boundless anger and hatred towards Mr. Pilmar. \u2026 For this crime, for this murder \u2026 I sentence each of you to 25 years to life incarceration.\n\nIt's the maximum sentence. And it's what Howard's family, except for Philip, wanted. But still, they are not doing much celebrating.\n\nHeather Pilmar: It's bittersweet. \u2026 There's justice for Howard and that's the important thing, but there's collateral damage. \u2026 We all lost something.\n\n\"We got them finally after all these years,\" Frank Pilmar tells his son. CBS News\n\nRichard Schlesinger: What does justice feel like? You've gotten it.\n\nFrank Pilmar: Justice feels like, uh, like happiness. \u2026 I just feel that \"Frank you worked at it. \u2026 All your work paid off.\"\n\nFrank Pilmar [at cemetery]: We got them finally after all these years.\n\nRoslyn Pilmar and Evan Wald are appealing their verdicts.", "description": "After a NYC businessman is found dead in his office stabbed 48 times, police zero in on those who saw him last: his wife and her brother.
