That one inning when he walked (Ty) France and (Luis) Urias, that put him at 88 after five. I\u2019m always counting pitches and I\u2019m looking, this is a possible seven innings, at least, and then the walks just did not permit that to happen. But he\u2019s uncanny coming out of his breaking ball. It\u2019s ridiculously good, especially against left-handers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say negative about his performance. It was great.\u201d\n\nThe Padres scored in the ninth when Manny Machado was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and two outs, but Rowan Wick struck out Luis Urias to end it.\n\nChicago split the four-game series and won for just the second time in seven games. The Brewers beat the Miami Marlins 3-2.\n\nDarvish (6-6) retired his first eight batters before allowing his first hit, an infield single by starter Dinelson Lamet. Darvish kicked the ball with his right foot and it caromed to third baseman Kris Bryant. Darvish struck out Greg Garcia to end the inning.\n\nThe big right-hander had at least one strikeout in every inning. After Greg Garcia tripled leading off the sixth, Darvish finished strong by striking out the side, including Eric Hosmer for the third straight time.\n\nDarvish was one shy of his career high, set Aug. 12, 2013, at Houston while he was with the Texas Rangers. He led the big leagues that year with 277 strikeouts.\n\nDarvish said he blocked out the Cubs\u2019 losses to the Padres the previous two nights.\n\n\u201cYou know me, I don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cI always focus to do my job and throw strikes and throw the right pitch in the right situation. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAs well as he pitched, \u201cToday\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cKnuckle-curveball for sure, splitter is not there, hard cutter was good. Slow curve was good. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d\n\nSaid San Diego\u2019s Wil Myers: \u201cThat was one of the better versions I\u2019ve seen out of him. He was mixing really well, locating well. When you\u2019re getting some pitches off the plate and have the ability to get back in counts sometimes, that\u2019s really what it is.\u201d\n\nMyers was ejected by plate umpire Ramon De Jesus in the ninth after he questioned a strike call.\n\n\u201cYou guys saw the game. There were a lot of calls that could have been different,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI think that 3-1 pitch in the sixth inning was tough. I worked a walk there. Darvish obviously threw the ball really well. I think that last pitch just kind of set me off. It is what it is. I know umpires don\u2019t get them right all the time, but I feel like sometimes we\u2019ve got to lock it in a little bit better.\u201d\n\nDarvish has 204 strikeouts in 163 1/3 innins.\n\n\u201cHe had a good mix, good stuff today,\u201d San Diego manager Andy Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s got punchout stuff. He always has. When he\u2019s on, he\u2019s really tough. He threw a really good game. There were some pitches at the margins that you know how we felt about them today.\n\n\u201cOverall though just not enough competitive at-bats, getting balls in play late in counts when needed to. You look up, you\u2019re in the ninth inning, you\u2019ve got a chance to win the baseball game with one swing of the bat. That\u2019s kind of the way that game went.\u201d\n\nDown 4-0, the Padres scored when Machado pinch-hit for the first time in his career and was plunked. Urias looked at 2-2 breaking ball for strike three - Cubs pitchers fanned 19 overall.\n\nLamet (2-5) issued leadoff walks in the first and fourth and both scored, including Anthony Rizzo on Kris Bryant\u2019s sacrifice fly in the first. Kyle Schwarber walked opening the fourth and Bryant singled. They pulled off a double steal and scored on Ian Happ\u2019s single.\n\nLamet allowed three runs and four hits in five innings, struck out seven and walked two.\n\nBen Zobrist had an RBI grounder in the seventh.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCubs: LHP Jon Lester (12-10, 4.51) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game home series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, who are due to counter with LHP Steven Brault (4-4, 4.13).\n\nPadres: LHP Joey Lucchesi (10-7, 3.84) is scheduled to start the opener of a three-game series at Colorado, which will counter with RHP Jeff Hoffman (1-6, 7.06).\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Yu Darvish and the Chicago Cubs are heading back to Wrigley Field feeling better about their situation than they had in several days.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bernie Wilson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/cubs_padres_baseball_04269_c0-154-3685-2302_s1770x1032.jpg?84983687623f9d029b83d52d0f39667a1bab5bd9"}
