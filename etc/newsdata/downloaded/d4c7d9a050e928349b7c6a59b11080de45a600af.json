Photo: Christopher Jue/Getty Images\n\nHonestly asking! Not for a friend, for me, who witnessed this behind-the-scenes video of Brad Pitt\u2019s GQ photo shoot and immediately pictured him winking good-bye as he laid a foot on the pedal and hit me with a burnt-orange dune buggy. Then, I Googled \u201cdune buggy\u201d because I wasn\u2019t fully sure what this tiny, roofless car was. Who among us has not tweeted at a celebrity to hit them with a truck, a car, a helicopter, or a motorcycle driven by a chauffeur their father paid for? How have they not copy-pasted images from GQ and sent them in a group chat called \u201cThirst Journalism\u201d so that five of their horniest friends could also dissect what Brad meant when he nodded at the beginning of this clip? Again, I\u2019m honestly asking.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not wearing a knotted button-down and posing on a motorcycle, Brad can be seen in James Gray\u2019s space film, Ad Astra. A legendary astronaut, Pitt\u2019s Roy McBride is sent to space on a mission to find his dad (Tommy Lee Jones), who may be responsible for catastrophic events on Earth. But first he must do one thing: Run me over with a rocket ship, please!", "description": "Brad Pitt\u2019s new \u201cGQ\u201d cover photo shoot has us asking the important questions. For example, will he run us over, please?", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/16/16-brad-pitt.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
