(Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images For Comedy Central)\n\nSometimes, if you\u2019re a celebrity, you have no choice but to turn traumatic family experiences into a joke. At least, that was the takeaway from Sunday night\u2019s \u201cComedy Central Roast of Alec Baldwin,\u201d which included many zingers about how he\u2019s a neglectful parent. And everyone laughed uproariously!\n\nIt was hard to imagine this scenario in 2007, when Baldwin\u2019s infamous voice mail to his young daughter Ireland was leaked to TMZ. Baldwin, who was in a contentious custody battle with his ex-wife, actress Kim Basinger, called 11-year-old Ireland a \u201crude, thoughtless little pig\u201d after she missed one of their scheduled phone calls. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the brains or the decency as a human being,\u201d he fumed on the message, which spread all over the Internet. Baldwin later released a statement of apology, saying he had been \u201cdriven to the edge by parental alienation.\u201d\n\n[All the times Alec Baldwin has suggested he\u2019s done playing Trump on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019]\n\nA dozen years later, Baldwin has addressed the incident quite a few times; as has Ireland, who is now a 23-year-old model. And apparently, they have both moved on enough to make it a centerpiece of Baldwin\u2019s Comedy Central roast. The two-hour telecast was taped last weekend in Beverly Hills, Calif., and afterward, Ireland\u2019s appearance as the \u201csurprise\u201d roaster quickly became one of the main headlines from the event. Particularly her line about Basinger\u2019s acting career: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy being the daughter of an iconic movie star. But I\u2019m not here to talk about my mother. Or her Oscar.\u201d\n\nBefore Sunday\u2019s broadcast, Comedy Central released a brief video clip with several jabs from Ireland, who opened her set by pretending to introduce herself to him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be here. I almost didn\u2019t even know about it because I haven\u2019t checked my voice mails from my dad from the last 12 years or something?\u201d she said, as the audience cracked up. \u201cWhile a lot of people know my dad as that guy from the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 movies or that guy from \u201930 Rock,\u2019 I know him as that guy from, like, half of my birthday parties.\u201d\n\nBut the rest of her televised roast was even more brutal. Some of her jokes included:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to talk to you, Dad, finally, without a court-appointed social worker. It\u2019s so nice that we can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was a great dad. I still remember when he would tuck me in and yell me a bedtime story. My absolute favorite and his favorite, \u2018The Three Little Thoughtless Pigs.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I turned out fine. I\u2019ve been modeling, which is a really fun gig. Honestly, it\u2019s just nice for a Baldwin to be on a runway without starting beef with American Airlines.\u201d (Alec Baldwin raised a middle finger in response to this reference of being kicked off a flight in 2011 for being \u201cextremely rude\u201d to the crew.) \u201cI was so surprised when I heard about that plane incident. I mean, why would you even start [bleep] with the one place that\u2019s still playing your movies?\u201d\n\nAnd this one caused Baldwin\u2019s jaw to drop: \u201cA lot of people only know my dad as an angry guy, but he\u2019s more than some lunatic who loses his temper. He also loses Emmys. And Oscars. And custody of his firstborn child.\u201d\n\nAfter a few more digs about his neglect, Ireland closed with this: \u201cSeriously, Dad, I\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re a wonderful father and an amazing actor, and I\u2019m thrilled to be here to see you celebrated tonight. After all the years of giving verbal abuse, it\u2019s finally time you received some. So before I leave, I\u2019d just like to say something you\u2019ve never said to me: good night.\u201d\n\nIreland wasn\u2019t the only one who took shots at their complicated relationship. In addition to mocking his anger issues and second marriage to Hilaria Baldwin, who is 26 years his junior, fellow roasters had a field day skewering that infamous voice mail. Sean Hayes: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Alec, nothing said here tonight will be meaner than what you left on your daughter\u2019s voice mail.\u201d Ken Jeong: \u201cAlec\u2019s daughter Ireland is here. She might as well be named Zimbabwe, given the distance between them.\u201d Blake Griffin: \u201cYou truly are a kind, thoughtful little pig.\u201d\n\nOf course, when Baldwin delivered his speech with burns aimed at his roasters (which also included Robert De Niro, Caitlyn Jenner, Chris Redd, Nikki Glaser, Caroline Rhea, Adam Carolla and Jeff Ross), he didn\u2019t say a negative word about his daughter. But he also didn\u2019t completely avoid the topic.\n\n\u201cI love all of you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t believe me, check your voice mails.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\n12 new fall TV shows to watch (\u2018Unbelievable,\u2019 \u2018Evil,\u2019 \u2018Watchmen\u2019) and 5 you can probably skip\n\nWhat you missed at the Creative Arts Emmys, from James Corden besting Beyonc\u00e9 to a pregnancy announcement\n\nReview | Ken Burn\u2019s \u2018Country Music\u2019 is full of high praise and heartbreak, but short on analysis", "description": "\"He\u2019s more than some lunatic who loses his temper.
