Unbelievably, I wasn\u2019t joking. Even more unbelievably, it\u2019s finished, and it\u2019s released today.\n\nHe added:\n\nIt's basically a sarcastic eulogy for our collective sanity. It takes some of the vague reassurances and blithely stated bullshit that we\u2019ve been fed for the past 3 years, and sets it to the most relentlessly upbeat soundtrack that my colleagues and I could muster.\n\nWith songs like 'Lets Go W.T.O' and 'Freedom of Movement' you might be fooled into thinking that this is some sort of ridiculous comedy album.\n\nWhile that is mostly true the songs are actually pretty decent and you won't regret listening to them. You can listen to a sample in the tweet below.", "description": "There is now a disco concept album about Brexit and it\u2019s much better than you might think.", "authors": ["Darren Richman"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/10/brexitdisco-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
