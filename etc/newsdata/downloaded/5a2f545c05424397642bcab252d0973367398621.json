But here is the rough timetable events which Westminster insiders are expecting:\n\nMonday 2 September: Boris Johnson called an unexpected meeting of his cabinet to agree that any parliamentary motion which ties his hands in negotiations with Brussels should be regarded as an issue of confidence in his handling of Brexit talks. This makes it easier for any rebels to be stripped of the Tory whip and barred from standing for the party in an election, but also heightens speculation that a snap election may be on the way. Immediately after the meeting, Johnson was addressing Conservative MPs at a No 10 garden party.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Mr Johnson will make an oral statement on last month\u2019s G7 summit in Biarritz. After he has finished, a \u201crebel alliance\u201c taking in Labour, Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties, as well as 20 or more Tories, are expected to seek an emergency debate. Crucially, they will also press speaker John Bercow to stretch parliamentary convention by allowing a substantive vote in the evening which could enable them to take control of the agenda on Wednesday. Any Tory MPs voting with the rebels can expect to be thrown out of the party.\n\nWednesday 4 September: Mr Johnson has summoned his cabinet to an early morning meeting in No 10 ahead of his first appearance at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions at noon. If Tuesday\u2019s motion succeeds, the rebel alliance will take control of the Commons agenda for the rest of the day, aiming to force through a bill requiring the prime minister to extend Brexit negotiations unless a deal is reached or parliament approves a no-deal withdrawal by 19 October. Differences on the length of the proposed extension are understood to have been bridged, with a new departure date of 31 January thought most likely. The debate will overshadow chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s statement on the year\u2019s spending round, which may have to be delayed to another date.\n\nThursday 5 September: If the rebel bill clears the Commons, it will move to the Lords, where opponents of no deal hope to overcome any attempts at filibustering and have the legislation ready for royal assent early next week.\n\nFriday 6 September: The Commons is not due to sit, but there is a possibility that MPs, concerned over Mr Johnson\u2019s plan to suspend parliament for five weeks from early next week, could vote to sit on Friday and through the weekend to give themselves maximum time to block no deal.\n\nAt any point, Mr Johnson could upset the rebels\u2019 plans by announcing his intention to call an early election. To do this, he would need to secure a two-thirds majority in the Commons, effectively making it dependent on the votes of Labour MPs. Labour has indicated that it will not seek to oust Mr Johnson through a vote of no confidence until the legislative route to blocking no deal has been tried.", "description": "In a fast-moving and unpredictable political environment, it is far from clear how the Brexit process will unfold in the coming days and weeks.\u00a0But here is the rough timetable events which Westminster insiders are expecting:", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/19/19/boris-johnson-parliament.jpg"}
