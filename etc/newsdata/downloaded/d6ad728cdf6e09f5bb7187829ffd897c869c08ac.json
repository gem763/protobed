He has also introduced other limitations, including threats of sanctions against any country importing oil from Iran, causing a more than 80% drop in the OPEC member's oil exports.\n\n\"Our oil industry is alive, it is active. The U.S. sanctions cannot stop Iran's oil exports,\" Zanganeh said.\n\nTrump has pursued a policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran to try to force it into broader talks to restrict its ballistic missile program and end its support for proxy forces around the Middle East.\n\nBut Iran has ruled out talks until all sanctions imposed on it are lifted. European parties to the deal have struggled to calm the deepening confrontation between Iran and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Writing by Parisa Hafezi, editing by Louise Heavens and Christina Fincher)", "description": "Iran will adopt a policy of maximum crude production if the United States lifts sanctions on the country's oil industry, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday.  \"Maximum production would be the Iranian Ministry of Petroleum's policy in case (U.S.) sanctions are eased on Iran", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/M5X0CcSLhyBZDod7kMR7bQ--~B/aD0yOTQ7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/2e50d851cebae1a37ef56a22b0d9b1cf", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
