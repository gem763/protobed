While there is no queue for cases like this, she did ask how come the Australians can solve their hostage cases in a couple of months while the UK has taken over three and a half years. I had no answer.\u201d\n\nMarise Payne, the Australian foreign affairs minister, said the release of King and Firkin had come after \u201cvery sensitive\u201d negotiations between the two countries\u2019 governments.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said last month that Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate was connected to a historic debt Britain owed Iran over a decades-old weapons deal.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe and her husband decided last week their five-year-old daughter, Gabrielle, would be returned to the UK, having been in Tehran since her mother\u2019s arrest in 2016. In a letter, she said the separation from her child would leave her a \u201cdesolate mother ready to burn like a desert dune\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, another British-Australian woman, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, remained in Evin prison, where she has been for almost a year. Moore-Gilbert, a Cambridge-educated, Melbourne-based academic specialising in Islamic and Middle East studies, has reportedly been handed a 10-year sentence, also on a charge of espionage.\n\nAustralian officials are still working to secure her release.", "description": "British-Iranian national questions UK\u2019s failure to secure her freedom, says husband", "authors": ["Nadeem Badshah"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ea44d0b979b4cbaedadc26add84e5d1a689f266/53_0_3308_1985/master/3308.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b8b6c781a5fa8fb09a54ef7cc8565fc6", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
