Having read no interview, no blog and no application, was your oversight sufficient and responsible?\n\n10 Why, when Operation Midland ended, did you state \u2018we have found no evidence of Nick (Beech) wilfully misleading the investigation team or perverting the course of justice\u2019? This is singularly inaccurate as Beech\u2019s subsequent convictions demonstrate.", "description": "Ex-yard Deputy Assistant Commissioner Steve Rodhouse has a top job at the UK's National Crime Agency after he was cleared in four months by police watchdogs without even being interviewed.", "authors": ["Daily Mail Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/23/19371704-0-image-a-31_1570401651916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
