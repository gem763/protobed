It also knows the Kremlin\u2019s shit-posting operation \u2014 the one that was so successful in 2016 \u2014 is likely to evolve in response.\n\nThe latest chapter in that cat-and-mouse game came Monday, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company will put labels on state-controlled press organs as part of its new slate of election-security measures. He also announced that his company had suspended hundreds of accounts across Facebook and Instagram that were part of disinformation campaigns by Iran and Russia.\n\nIt was an early preview of how the next year will play out between the tech giant that's home to much of the world\u2019s political communication and U.S. adversaries trying to tip the scales.\n\n\u201cWe face increasingly sophisticated attacks from nation-states like Russia, Iran, and China,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better. They\u2019re getting better.\u201d\n\nREAD: Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know he cares 'deeply' about conservative bias\n\nIn a conference call Monday, Zuckerberg and other top brass unveiled new guardrails to protect against misinformation and foreign election meddling. They included more prominent disclaimers for fact-checked content, new rules to shed light on who\u2019s behind individual Pages, and a labeling system for propaganda.\n\nThe Russian government reached millions of American Facebook users through both overt and covert means in the last presidential election. Kremlin-backed groups pushed ads and organic content on divisive social issues using fake accounts. And state media outlets such as RT and Sputnik published political coverage that was relentlessly anti-Hillary Clinton.\n\nZuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s new policy for such content intends to distinguish between publicly financed media with independent newsrooms and state-controlled outlets \u201cacting as an organ of the government rather than a free press.\u201d\n\nHow the company defines propaganda could rankle organizations like RT, which boasts 1.1 million followers on its U.S.-focused page. A Facebook spokesperson said Monday that he \u201ccan't speak to every publisher that we are going to label\u201d when VICE News inquired about RT, but the outlet has been on the receiving end of Facebook policy enforcement in the past.\n\nREAD: Facebook just gave the green light to politicians to lie in their ads\n\nCompany officials also trumpeted their more proactive defense against covert influence campaigns using fake accounts. Three of the operations thwarted on Monday originated in Iran, Facebook said in a blog post, while another came from the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, a group that interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nThat latter campaign comprised 50 Instagram accounts and one Facebook account that produced content focusing on racial tensions, the Confederacy, and other divisive topics. They combined for 246,000 followers across platforms.\n\nNathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy, said Monday that those efforts will likely grow in scale over the next year.\n\n\u201cIt is fairly early in their operational cycle. They were still trying to build their audience,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were able to find them and stop them before they were able to complete their operation.\u201d\n\nREAD: Mark Zuckerberg is apparently headhunting for Mayor Pete now\n\nGleicher also warned that domestic actors are playing a growing role in sowing discord on Facebook around the world. Those efforts are in some cases harder to track and more effective. Facebook tweaked its policies Monday to hone in on homegrown bot networks in response.\n\n\u201cIf you want to manipulate the public debate, you have to understand the public debate,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook claims it has disrupted 50 attempts to interfere in elections around the world in the past year, though \u2014 unlike Twitter \u2014 it releases little data about those efforts. It has also unveiled a new Ad Library for political and issues ads that allows watchdogs to follow campaign spending and messaging. Some researchers have criticized the tool for preventing bulk data collection.\n\nWashington carries out its own influence operations abroad through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, bringing Americanized news to more than 100 countries through outlets including Voice of America. While the agency has launched 24/7 news networks in Russian and Farsi in recent years, with a Mandarin outlet in the works, the Kremlin is still outgunning the U.S. government in the infowar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what they invest in RT and in Sputnik and in other Russian media, but I know it\u2019s more than what the United States government invests,\u201d John Lansing, then-CEO of the agency, said at a July hearing before the House of Representatives. \u201cI think it\u2019s around a 10x factor.\u201d\n\nThat long-term strategy has left disinformation researchers still pointing to Moscow as a primary threat next year.\n\n\u201cThe Kremlin is a chaos monster,\u201d Jed Willard, global engagement director of the FDR Foundation at Harvard, previously told VICE News. \u201cTheir frame is Americans can\u2019t trust Americans.\u201d\n\nCover: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at Georgetown University in a 'Conversation on Free Expression\" in Washington, D.C., on October 17, 2019.
