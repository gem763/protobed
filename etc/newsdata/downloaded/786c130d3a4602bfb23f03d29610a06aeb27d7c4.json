REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido\n\nHARARE (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Zimbabwe needed to intensify efforts on economic and political fronts, as the government faces a growing chorus of criticism over its commitment to reform.\n\nThe southern African nation is feeling the effects of a drought that has hit crops and electricity generation, while soaring prices and shortages of foreign currency and fuel have sparked anger among a restive population.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa\u2019s opponents say the government is failing to implement political reforms, including amending security and media laws, which are seen as preconditions to improving ties with the West.\n\n\u201cPolicy actions are urgently needed to tackle the root causes of economic instability and enable private-sector led growth,\u201d the IMF, which visited Harare this month to review progress on a staff-monitored program, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe key challenge is to contain fiscal spending consistent with non-inflationary financing and tighten monetary policy to stabilize the exchange rate and start rebuilding confidence in the national currency.\u201d\n\nThe government has taken steps this year to relaunch the Zimbabwean dollar after a decade of dollarisation but these have increased people\u2019s hardships and have been criticized for being poorly communicated.\n\nFinancial policymakers insist the currency reforms will lay the foundations for future growth.\n\nThe IMF said the economy faced a steep contraction this year, while it said the annual inflation rate, which the government last published in June, reached almost 300% in August.", "description": "The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Zimbabwe needed to intensify efforts on economic and political fronts, as the government faces a growing chorus of criticism over its commitment to reform.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434174068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P1AP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
