The existing shareholders Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV), Granite Ventures, and Sequoia Capital will remain as minority investors, the companies said in a joint statement.\n\nThe deal comes as big companies are increasingly looking to remove bias from hiring decisions and find new ways of reaching qualified job applicants.\n\nHireVue, founded in 2004 in Salt Lake City, has raised over $90 million in venture capital investment and counts more than a third of the Fortune 100 as customers, including Hilton, Goldman Sachs, and Intel. It says it uses 25,000-plus data points when screening applicants, including whether or not they smile, body language, and word choices. The software claims to reduce the time it takes to hire a candidate by 90% on average, while leading to better hires overall with improved diversity.\n\nRead more: Elizabeth Warren's attack on private equity could have a surprising group of backers: Investors in private equity\n\nGoldman Sachs changed its approach to college recruiting in 2016 and has said it used HireVue rather than first-round interviews on undergraduate campuses to attract a broader array of candidates beyond Ivy Leaguers.\n\nPatrick McCarter, the cohead of Carlyle's technology, media, and telecom group, said he was so impressed with the software that he reached out to HireVue CEO Kevin Parker earlier this year through a mutual connection at TCV. From there, a May breakfast meeting was scheduled in Palo Alto, California, where the pair discussed HireVue's future.\n\nFor HireVue, Carlyle has an existing network of technology advisers and 277 Carlyle-owned companies, at least some of which they hope to convert to HireVue customers. Carlyle isn't yet a HireVue client itself, but that may soon change, McCarter said.\n\nAlready, Carlyle has made HireVue introductions to several of its own companies, and HireVue has provided demos of its product, according to a person familiar with the matter. The private-equity firm also intends to tap its relationships with consulting, law, and accounting firms, this person said.\n\nRead more: Private-equity giant Carlyle just used an unusual approach to clinch a big-time music deal with Rascal Flatts and Taylor Swift\n\nOne adviser HireVue may find helpful is Terry Myerson, a former senior Microsoft executive who led the development of Windows, Surface, Xbox, and Exchange. Myerson joined Carlyle last year as an operating executive and works with its companies on developing and executing technology strategies.\n\nThe existing management team at HireVue will stay intact, Parker said, with additional board seats to be given to Carlyle executives. Exactly how many and who will assume responsibilities has yet to be determined.\n\nThe equity capital for the investment will come from Carlyle Partners VII, the firm's largest-ever fund at $18.5 billion, which began investing last summer. The fund's focus is on majority and strategic minority investments throughout the US.\n\nGoldman Sachs acted as exclusive financial adviser to HireVue.", "description": "HireVue counts more than a third of the Fortune 100 as customers, including Intel, Goldman Sachs, and Hilton.", "authors": ["Casey Sullivan"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6db4c02e22af633b78a1a2-1536-768.png"}
