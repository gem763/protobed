Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA and congressional Democrats used the shooting \u2013 and even the report \u2013 as just another opportunity to attack Trump.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott passed historic school safety legislation and launched a state commission to investigate what went wrong in Parkland. Florida Democrats used the shooting as an opportunity to attack Scott and try to flip Florida blue.\n\nI wanted to know everything that happened, expose all of the failures, and hold people accountable. Because I didn\u2019t simply want to blame the National Rifle Association (NRA), the media labeled me the \u201cpro-gun\u201d Parkland dad.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make much sense to me until I conducted my own investigation, which turned into a book: Why Meadow Died \u2013 The People and Policies that Created the Parkland Shooter and Endanger America\u2019s Students.\n\nMy conclusion: If one single individual in Broward County school district made one single responsible decision about the shooter, it could have been avoided.\n\nBut you can\u2019t even call what happened a \u201cfailure\u201d because each obviously recklessly irresponsible decision made perfect sense given the policies of Broward County schools and the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit from my conclusion:\n\nI\u2019ve been over every inch of what happened. The NRA had nothing to do with it. This happened in a Democrat county with a Democrat sheriff, a Democrat superintendent, and a Democrat school board, implementing Democrat ideas on criminal justice, Democrat ideas on special education, and Democrat ideas on school discipline.\n\nMeanwhile, at the national level, Democrat organizers swooped in and weaponized my daughter\u2019s murder for their Democrat agenda and to fund-raise to elect more Democrats.\n\nOf all of the failures, perhaps the clearest and worst came from the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, led by disgraced former Sheriff Scott Israel.\n\nDeputies were called to the shooter\u2019s house 45 times, but he was never arrested \u2013 following a policy set by Scott Israel to not arrest juveniles.\n\nEight Broward Deputies arrived on the scene while the shots were still ringing out and didn\u2019t go in \u2013 following a policy set by Scott Israel to make confronting an active shooter optional.\n\nSheriff Israel once told CNN that he had shown \u201camazing leadership.\u201d\n\nApparently, Florida Democrats believe whatever they see on CNN.\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis removed Sheriff Israel from office. Israel appealed to the Florida Senate \u2013 where all but three Florida Senate Democrats voted to reinstate him.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by Senators Randolph Bracy, Darryl Rouson, Annette Taddeo \u2014 all Democrats, but none from Broward County.\n\nFortunately, Florida is a red state. Because the Democrats have proven \u2013 once and for all \u2013 that they are happy to put more kids\u2019 lives at risk in order to advance their own political power.\n\nPeople ask me all the time, \u201cAndy, why are you so negative about Democrats?\u201d And I tell them to read Why Meadow Died to understand how the Democrats have wrecked public education with policies that led to my daughter\u2019s murder, and then used a tragedy they created to advance their dangerous agenda.\n\nIf a Democrat is elected to the White House, policies that put kids\u2019 lives at risk will become mandatory in all public schools. And every murdered child will become another opportunity for them to attack Republicans and grow their power.\n\nThey have no decency. One Broward Democrat state senator, Perry Thurston, apparently fell asleep during the debate.\n\nBroward Democrat state senator Lauren Book, who served on the state investigative commission, and knew every single failure \u2014 who saw the video of my daughter being murdered, and cried with the families \u2014 invoked the birthday of a Parkland student before voting to re-instate a sheriff whose failed policies and leadership she knew had allowed this child to be murdered in school.\n\nBut can you even blame her for that? It\u2019s just who she is. She is a Democrat politician.", "description": "Of all of the Parkland failures, perhaps the worst came from the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office, led by disgraced former Sheriff Scott Israel.", "authors": ["Andrew Pollack"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/Broward-County-Sheriff.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
