Photo: Tom Williams/Getty Images\n\nThere are few problems in American society for which conservatives won\u2019t cite Chicago as a defining emblem. When Barack Obama\u2019s star was rising in national politics, the city\u2019s ills were proof that he couldn\u2019t govern. (He was a state legislator and then United States senator at the time, and therefore not involved in his adoptive hometown\u2019s day-to-day operations.) When black people get killed by police, the right submits homicide statistics in Chicago as proof that \u201cblack-on-black crime\u201d is the real problem. That killers of all backgrounds tend to kill people who look like them; that violence in poor, racially segregated neighborhoods abounds in most large cities; and that both are logical results of decades of racist policies and practices, from restrictive covenants to the terrorism enforcing them, go unmentioned. And when mass shootings occur and the prospect of stricter gun-control legislation is floated, conservatives point to Chicago as proof that restrictive gun laws don\u2019t work.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz is no different. After the Labor Day\u2013weekend massacre in his home state of Texas, where a gunman killed seven people in Midland and Odessa, the Republican went on Twitter to reject gun control as a solution. \u201cGun control doesn\u2019t work. Look at Chicago,\u201d he tweeted, citing a story from Breitbart. \u201cDisarming law-abiding citizens isn\u2019t the answer. Stopping violent criminals \u2014 prosecuting [and] getting them off the street \u2014 BEFORE they commit more violent crimes is the most effective way to reduce murder rates.\u201d These remarks prompted a back-and-forth with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a Democrat, who tweeted, \u201c[Sixty percent] of illegal firearms recovered in Chicago come from outside IL \u2014 mostly from states dominated by coward Republicans like you who refuse to enact commonsense [sic] gun legislation.\u201d Cruz responded that Lightfoot\u2019s \u201canger\u201d was misplaced, adding that Chicago \u2014 which has \u201chad Democratic mayors for decades and aggressive gun-control policies\u201d \u2014 regularly leads the country in total murders. \u201cMaybe, rather than getting angry when others point out the tragically high murder rate in Chicago, you put aside the partisan talking points & the failed gun-control policies Chicago has pursued for decades,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cInstead, lock up the violent criminals who are committing murder.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting from the outset that the debate around violence in the Windy City is mired in lies. Chicago\u2019s murder rate was outstripped by that of eight others in 2017 \u2014 all located in states governed by Republicans, incidentally; that makes its rate notable, but not an outlier among large cities. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s murder numbers have been dropping: Homicides in 2018 were down 28 percent from 2016, and have plummeted since the 1990s, which themselves saw numbers well below the highs of the 1970s and 1980s. Nor does Chicago have uniquely aggressive gun-control policies \u2014 certainly not the \u201cstrictest \u2026 in the nation,\u201d as former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and President Trump have both claimed. The city\u2019s 1982 handgun ban was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court a decade ago, and unlike New York and California \u2014 the only two states that house cities larger than Chicago \u2014 Illinois doesn\u2019t require a state license for firearms dealers or to sell ammunition.\n\nThe truth is that Chicago\u2019s problems have little to do with the partisan makeup of those governing it. As with most U.S. cities and states, its leaders have proven more than capable of providing a high quality of life and abundant safety for its white and wealthier residents. Their failures are felt most by black and poor people. That five police districts overseeing 8 percent of Chicago\u2019s residents \u2014 the vast majority of them black \u2014 recorded nearly one-third of its murders in 2016 illustrates how wider variety often exists within cities than between them when it comes to murder rates, and that these disparities stem from racist policies and practices. That calls for better jobs, housing, schools, and health care in these neighborhoods have been met repeatedly with the very brand of aggressive law enforcement that Cruz claims to be the solution illustrates why he\u2019s not to be taken seriously.\n\nIf curbing gun violence in Chicago really was a matter of \u201cprosecuting\u201d and \u201c[locking] up\u201d more people, as the senator suggests, it would likely be one of the safest cities in America. The Cook County jail doesn\u2019t house more than 8,000 prisoners on a given day because local law enforcement is too lenient. State\u2019s Attorney Kimberly Foxx won election in 2016 promising to minimize contact between Chicagoans and the criminal-justice system; she appears to have done so, and without the corresponding spike in crime that critics of reform-minded prosecution often predict. But her predecessor, Anita Alvarez, was different.\n\nDuring her eight years in office, from 2008 to 2016, the former S.A. oversaw a dramatic increase in jail overcrowding, underscored by a pattern of behavior that included recommending life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile defendants; charging residents with felony wiretapping for recording encounters with police; undermining her own case against a police officer who killed an unarmed black woman, Rekia Boyd, to ensure his acquittal; and most famously, declining to charge former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke with a crime for killing Laquan McDonald until more than a year after the fact, when footage of the murder was made public and weathering the backlash became unsustainable. That Alvarez\u2019s prosecutorial aggression was standard procedure while conservatives were using Chicago as a cudgel to undermine Obama is equally telling: Locking people up wasn\u2019t working then \u2014 murders spiked during Alvarez\u2019s last year in office. Why is it Cruz\u2019s solution now that murders are down and the Chicago Police Department is solving fewer murders by the year?\n\nThe simple answer is that the senator doesn\u2019t actually care about the black people of Chicago, who suffer disproportionately from gun violence in the city, nor about how to actually solve their problems. He\u2019s interested in undermining Democratic efforts to reduce firearm access, and is willing to invoke lazy tropes about the city to accomplish this, no matter how widely debunked they are. There\u2019s a valuable discussion to be had about the nuances of ongoing gun violence in Chicago \u2014 even experts are often confounded as to what causes year-over-year rate spikes and declines; all agree that the contributing factors are myriad. It\u2019s just not a discussion that Ted Cruz is interested in having. His commentary on the subject should be treated accordingly.", "description": "The senator\u2019s attempt to use Chicago to make a point about gun control is the conservative tradition of using the city as a political football.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/06/06-ted-cruz.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
