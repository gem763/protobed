He needed to feed right after birth so that his mother's milk didn't lose its anti-bodies that would protect him from disease\n\n'I really hope that baby seal makes it. Come on Mummy, you need to feed your baba,' one invested viewer pointed out.\n\n'Oh my goodness, cuteness overload,' another wrote.\n\nIt was explained in the documentary that the adult seal might have been a first-time-mother who didn't know exactly how to look after her pup, or she might have been too exhausted to let him feed.\n\nAt one point it looked as if there was a risk of the mother abandoning her pup altogether.\n\nSome viewers were scared for the poor seal pup and added they hoped it 'made it' when seeing him struggle to get fed\n\nTime was running out for the pup, whose immune system would be exposed to disease if he didn't get fed soon.\n\nThe baby tried to follow his mother along the beach but she was too fast for him.\n\nIn spite of his cries for help, the bigger seal didn't seem to change her mind, and kept moving further from her pup.\n\nThankfully, after hours of pleading and fighting, the mother stopped running away and gave the pup a sniff.\n\nThis way she was able to confirm it was indeed her pup, and finally lay down so that he could find her teat and feed.\n\nOn the other side of the beach, a female pup (pictured) was put in harm's way when she struggled to keep up with her bigger mother\n\nThe documentary gave an insight into how dangerous life can be for a newborn seal.\n\nAdult male seals are aggressive, and known to kill the young ones when the mothers are not looking.\n\nOne mother who had scooted off too quickly for her daughter put her in mortal danger when an adult male seal swooped in between them.\n\nIt took the mother some fierce arguing and bargaining to get the male to stand down.\n\nSeal pups like this one need to learn quickly in order to survive if they want to make it adulthood\n\nIn order to survive, pups have to learn the ropes from their mothers quickly so they can keep themselves out of harm's way.\n\nSeal pups are usually born between November and January. The mothers, have fed all summer to be fully ready to provide them with their fatty milk.\n\nSeals' body mass need to consist of 55 percent of fat so that they can brave the waters' cold temperature. It is therefore of the utmost important they get fed enough.\n\nMother seals will eventually leave their pups to fend for themselves while they take to sea again, and sadly only 30 percent of baby seals make it to adulthood.", "description": "A pup seal born in Northern England struggled for his life because his mother would not feed him.
