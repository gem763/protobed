Agreements of this nature usually last 20 years, with only annual inflation-related increases.\n\nAlthough the unit cost has come down to 70c/kWh in the fourth round, critics argue that the financial burden on Eskom in terms of renewable energy purchases is too high, and something needs to be done about it.\n\nIn March, energy regulator Nersa granted Eskom average tariff increases of 9.4%, 8.1% and 5.2% over the next three years.\n\nThe mining industry body, the Minerals Council, has said the tariff increase given to Eskom would jeopardise the viability of some marginal mines and accelerate job losses at energy-intensive operations.\n\nJob cuts are politically sensitive in Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy where a quarter of the labour force is unemployed, while power outages and steep price increases by Eskom are set to hurt an already fragile growth outlook.\n\nEskom owns and operates more than 13 coal-fired power stations and has supply agreements with firms including Exxaro Resources and South32.\n\nThe utility supplies more than 90% of the power in Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy, but has been grappling with cashflow and high debt problems, breakdowns at its creaking coal-fired power station fleet.\n\nThe minister, who highlighted that power cuts and electricity prices remain a concern, said lowering energy costs would involve discussions with various groups in the sector including coal producers, renewable energy firms and the energy regulator.\n\n- Reuters", "description": "Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe is in talks with coal firms that supply struggling state-owned power utility Eskom to reduce coal prices in a bid to lower energy costs and boost the mining sector.", "authors": ["Tanisha Heiberg"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8579/3db52d88fe9649509bafd479d6725d76.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
