Pictured: The lorry in which 39 bodies were discovered in the trailer\n\nSeparately, the port\u2019s chief harbourmaster admitted yesterday that just 1 per cent of sealed containers that leave Zeebrugge are X-rayed.\n\nIn a series of allegations about the state of Britain\u2019s border security, residents living near Purfleet docks in Essex said the arrival of illegal migrants was an \u2018open secret\u2019.\n\nThere were also claims that border staff were issued with handcuffs after migrants began stabbing themselves so they would be taken to hospital.\n\nThe sealed refrigerated shipping container in which the 39 migrants were found dead arrived at Purfleet from Zeebrugge on Wednesday.\n\nOne source said: \u2018There are only ad hoc searches at Purfleet but... every port of entry is causing us concern at the moment. It\u2019s not good.\u2019\n\nAnother source said British teams had worked closely with Belgian officials at Zeebrugge, but deployment of UK border agents was scaled back last year because of a lack of staff and funding. The source said: \u2018We are not getting replacement staff when people move on, and I estimate we are short of several hundred staff nationwide. It is an exceptionally difficult time.\u2019\n\nZeebrugge\u2019s harbourmaster, Peter Degroote, last night admitted that the vast majority of sealed containers that arrive at the port do not have their contents examined. He said: \u2018We do have a fixed X-ray scanner. The border checks for customs usually in Zeebrugge... is only for import into the EU. So for export there is very few checks.\u2019\n\nImmigration sources said there were fewer officers being deployed to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge as manpower was diverted to deal with the migrant crisis at French ports. Pictured: Police and forensic officers investigate the lorry\n\nPressed on how many sealed containers undergo these checks, Mr Degroote said: \u2018I would say 1 per cent maybe.\u2019\n\nBetween 4,000 and 7,000 containers pass through Zeebrugge each day, with roughly half bound for Britain. Port chief executive Joachim Coens stressed that one million euros is spent each year on security.\n\nIn the UK, one Border Force source said that colleagues had been issued with protective equipment after migrants who were found by search teams began self-harming.\n\nThe source said: \u2018The few UKBF officers present were issued with sets of handcuffs and stab-proof vests because clandestine individuals were stabbing themselves to get taken to hospital.\u2019\n\nThe sealed refrigerated shipping container in which the 39 migrants were found dead arrived at Purfleet from Zeebrugge on Wednesday\n\nResidents in Purfleet said yesterday that the arrival of groups of migrants at the port was an \u2018open secret\u2019.\n\nJanet Lilley, 61, said the area was a \u2018magnet\u2019 for migrants. She added: \u2018Over the years we\u2019ve found dozens of passports in the garden.\u2019\n\nNeighbour Susan Bridge, 47, claimed minibuses lined up to collect migrants, adding: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t say it was even a secret, to be honest.\u2019\n\nThurrock Council said it was unable to comment on the claims. Essex Police were approached for comment.\n\nThe container in which the 39 people died had also travelled to Calais and Dunkirk in the week before its arrival in Essex, it has emerged.\n\nGPS tracking data shows the refrigerated container made two trips across the Channel, The Times reported.\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \u2018Border Force will always ensure it has the resources it needs to keep our borders secure and is currently recruiting up to 1,000 new staff.\u2019", "description": "Immigration sources said there were fewer officers being deployed to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge as Manpower is diverted to deal with the migrant crisis at French ports.", "authors": ["David Barrett", "George Odling", "Andrew Levy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/02/20204444-0-image-a-52_1572052155503.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
