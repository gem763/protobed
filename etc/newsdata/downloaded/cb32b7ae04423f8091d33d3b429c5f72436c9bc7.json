The commission also ruled Sunday Riley must instruct its employees and agents to disclose their connections to the company in any endorsements, according to the order.\n\nNeither the company nor Sunday Riley, its namesake chief executive, admitted or denied wrongdoing, which drew a strong rebuke from FTC Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s proposed settlement includes no redress, no disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, no notice to consumers, and no admission of wrongdoing,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cSunday Riley and its CEO have clearly broken the law, and the Commission has ordered that they not break the law again.\u201d\n\nThe findings of the Sunday Riley settlement are meant to send a strong message. But the two dissenting commissioners noted the FTC\u2019s decision is unlikely to deter any other would-be wrongdoers.\n\nQuestions surrounding Sunday Riley\u2019s ethical practices swirled last year when a former employee went to Reddit and blew the whistle on the company\u2019s operations.\n\n\u201cWe were forced to write fake reviews for our products on an ongoing basis, which came directly from Sunday Riley herself and her Head of Sales,\u201d the Reddit user wrote, attaching a copy of an email showing instructions on how to post fake reviews.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe FTC said its investigation into Riley and her company confirmed the whistleblower\u2019s allegation.\n\nIn July 2016, Riley laid out a nine-step guide on how to create three Sephora.com accounts registered as different identities to write positive reviews for its products, according to the complaint\u2019s allegations. Some of the instructions told employees to review products every other day to build up history and to only review makeup, color and hair.\n\nAt the end of the July 2016 note to her staff, according to the complaint, she told them to dislike negative reviews because enough dislikes will have the negative reviews removed. That, she wrote, \u201cdirectly translates to sales!\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTidal and Good Genes are 4.2 and I would like to see them at 4.8+,\u201d she wrote about some of her most popular products, as cited by the FTC. \u201cUFO and Martian are at 4.9 \u2013 let\u2019s keep it that way!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe FTC said similar reminders were sent to staff and other managers by the company\u2019s account manager for Sephora as other products launched in December 2016 and August 2017.\n\n\u201cCredibility is key to the review,\u201d the Sunday Riley Skincare account manager responsible for Sephora wrote, according to the complaint. The account manager also pointed out how powerful reviews are as people look to what others are saying to \u201cpersuade them and answer potential questions they may have.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAfter Sephora removed fake reviews written by the skin-care brand\u2019s employees, the company used a virtual private network to hide the reviewers\u2019 IP addresses and locations, the FTC found.\n\nNeither Sunday Riley nor Sephora responded to requests for comment.\n\nSunday Riley and her company deceived consumers for their own advantage, said David Vladeck, a professor of law at Georgetown University and former director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. The agency has the dual purpose of protecting consumers and protecting the competition of the marketplace, and it has laid out strict guidelines for companies, he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of case the FTC does because the FTC does not have the resources to go after everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they go after people, they go after people who are market players and have been abusive in the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSunday Riley\u2019s revenue is estimated to be between $50 million to $100 million, according to Glassdoor.\n\nThe brand has gained a dedicated following thanks in part to major retailers such as Nordstrom and Bergdof Goodman offering its products. In April, United Airlines partnered with the skin-care firm to provide its business class and other elite passengers with Sunday Riley kits. The company said Sunday Riley products would also be available in shower facilities in various United Airlines lounge and club locations.\n\nThe brand\u2019s prominence has also risen as more celebrities have given it a stamp of approval, along with beauty influencers. But the news came as no surprise to influencers in the science and skin-care space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nComments of disreputable practices by Sunday Riley have been swirling for some years, said Victoria Fu, co-founder and chemist for Chemist Confessions, which provides ingredient breakdowns for followers seeking to know about the science in their skin care.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice if the FTC could make Sunday Riley an example, but on the flip side they\u2019re not the only one,\u201d she said.\n\nCosmetics formulator and skin-care expert Stephen Alain Ko also has a loyal following of skin-care and science enthusiasts. He captioned a picture of a Sunday Riley product with the FTC\u2019s findings and a lyric of the Foo Fighters hit \u201cBest Of You.\u201d\n\nThe company has had marketing clarity issues before, he said, but he\u2019s more surprised that the CEO of a company would write explicit instructions to employees.\n\nAD\n\nIf influencers have endorsed the brand in the past, they should stand by those statements \u2014 as long as what they said was truthful, Ko said.\n\nAD\n\nSunday Riley herself needs to issue a sincere, personal apology to her customers via socials media, said Steve Lee, professor of practice at Southern Methodist University and chairman and chief pathfinder of QSI Consulting Group in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThey need to take it head on and just be patient,\u201d he said of Sunday Riley\u2019s ability to recover. \u201cIf the product is good and the company\u2019s good, it\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t come off as authentic, he said, the path back to consumer trust will be much more difficult.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cWe were forced to write fake reviews for our products ... which came directly from Sunday Riley herself,\u201d the Reddit allegation said.
