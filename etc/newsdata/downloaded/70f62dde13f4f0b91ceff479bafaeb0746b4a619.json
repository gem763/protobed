They want the FDA to move faster to investigate and regulate e-cigarettes, touted by the industry as a way to reduce harm from traditional cigarette smoking but which has also led to what the FDA calls an \u201cepidemic\u201d of youth vaping of nicotine.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHealth authorities haven\u2019t fully untangled what\u2019s causing the respiratory disease, which has potentially affected more than 450 and killed six. Public health officials across 33 states have linked many of the cases to vaped forms of marijuana and its component CBD \u2014 both of which are in legal but in regulatory limbo. Counterfeit or black market nicotine vapes may also have a role \u2014 and legal vapes haven\u2019t been totally ruled out, but they aren\u2019t dominating the public health investigation into the illness.\n\nYet anti-tobacco lawmakers and children\u2019s health advocates are using the moment to demand more regulation of e-cigarettes, including industry powerhouse Juul. They want to go further than Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s bill, which would raise the age for buying all tobacco to 21. And they want consistent national standards, not a state-by-state patchwork as some areas of the country plow ahead on flavor bans.\n\nMcConnell, who is pushing the bill alongside Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, hasn\u2019t spoken about his bill in public in months, and his office Tuesday referred to his earlier statements about doing \u201ceverything we can to keep these harmful products out of high schools and out of youth culture.\"\n\nThe McConnell-Kaine bill is part of a broader health care cost bill, including drug prices and \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills, that\u2019s passed the Senate HELP committee but does not appear likely to come to the floor quickly.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Some, like Indiana Sen. Todd Young, who has sponsored legislation to raise the legal age to 21, say they\u2019re open to tougher measures. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, urged the FDA to pull e-cigarette products off the market.\n\nIn the House, Rep. Donna Shalala (D-Fla.) is in talks with Republicans about her broader bill with House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.). The legislation, which she believes will get a markup soon, would raise the tobacco purchasing age to 21, ban flavors and restrict advertising. And while there are 33 co-sponsors on the bill, just one \u2014 New York\u2019s Pete King \u2014 is a Republican.\n\nBut that was before the lung disease emerged, and Shalala now says, \u201cWe\u2019ll get Republican votes on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is keep the focus on kids. [That\u2019s how] we win the debate nationally with the American people,\u201d she added.\n\nLongtime vaping critic Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) has called on FDA acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless to act on the e-cigarette industry right now \u2014 or resign. Durbin has another meeting with Sharpless this week, he told POLITICO, just a few days after the FDA warned Juul against marketing its products as much safer than tobacco.\n\n\"As of last week, they'd done nothing,\u201d Durbin said of the FDA. \u201cAs of this week, they've done something at least confronting Juul with its health claims, which should have been done long ago.\u201d\n\nAn Energy and Commerce subcommittee will hold a hearing this Sept. 25 on the vaping-related illness and e-cigarette regulation. Pallone and Oversight and Investigations subcommittee chair Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said in a statement that they \u201care greatly concerned that e-cigarette products continue to be disseminated and used while consumers lack information\u201d on their health impact.\n\nThe FDA released a statement late Tuesday saying it\u2019s doing everything it can to get to the bottom of the illness, and protect young people. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to taking appropriate actions as the facts emerge and keeping the public informed as we have more information to share,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cCigarette smoking remains a leading cause of death and disease in the United States, and no tobacco product should be considered safe to use,\u201d it added.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are questioning whether the FDA should step up regulation of the e-cigarette industry, where no products have gone through federal review yet. A federal court order this summer moved the FDA deadline to May 2020, but in the meantime, hundreds of vapes remain on the market in regulatory limbo.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Cannabis High-quality coverage of one of the fastest growing industries in the country.

Many lawmakers say the unregulated landscape of e-cigarettes \u2014 and scarce research on vaping\u2019s purported benefits over smoking \u2014 is fueling a public health epidemic with no end in sight.\n\n\u201cThis has to be dealt with,\u201d said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who represents the state with the first reported vaping-related death. \u201cI would like to see these e-cigarettes absolutely banned, but part of the problem is, we know so little about what's actually in it.\u201d\n\nCritics argue that these bills would not touch what increasingly appears to be a key culprit in the outbreak: marijuana vapes, including THC-based products that give people a \u2018high\u2019 and recently legalized hemp-derived CBD, which has boomed in popularity and is in a regulatory void as FDA races to draw up regulations.\n\nMarijuana is still a touchy subject on the Hill, and legislation rescheduling pot \u2014 which would allow for more research and potentially let FDA set some regulatory ground rules \u2014 is less likely to head to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk than broader tobacco bills. Many Democratic lawmakers are also hesitant to narrow in on marijuana vapes when the broader e-cigarette industry has been in their sights for months now.\n\nLongtime proponents of marijuana legalization point to the current outbreak as an example of why federal action is needed.\n\n\"We can\u2019t continue to keep our heads in the sand on the federal level while this is happening at the state level,\u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo).\n\n\u201cThis is all an argument for why we need to legalize and regulate. We need to have standards. We need to make sure people know what's going on,\u201d said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.), a longtime proponent of marijuana legalization.\n\nSeveral Democrats, including DeGette and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, drew parallels between the vaping industry\u2019s strategies and cigarette companies\u2019 moves when they were put under the spotlight in the 1990s.\n\nTlaib pointed to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s recent order to temporarily ban e-cigarette flavors as evidence the federal government should take a stronger stance. \u201cI think there\u2019s been new momentum because parents are now starting to see this, that their children are targeted by these companies and their flavors,\u201d she said. She compared e-cigarette makers responses\u2019 to criticism \u2014 that they are helping smokers switch off more dangerous tobacco products \u2014 to \u201cgaslighting.\u201d\n\nThe number of teenagers vaping is increasing \u2014 3.6 million last year, compared with 2.1 million in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt certainly scares the hell out of us,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nNatalie Fertig and Adam Cancryn contributed to this report.", "description": "Health authorities haven\u2019t fully untangled what\u2019s causing the respiratory disease, which has potentially affected more than 450 and killed six.", "authors": ["Sarah Owermohle", "Rachel Roubein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b3/94/6e0c35534c0c8286502645d3bb85/20190910-vaping-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
