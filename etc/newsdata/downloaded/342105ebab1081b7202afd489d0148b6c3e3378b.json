That would require openness rather than a \"de-coupling\" of countries or a new Cold War.\n\nChina has been nervous that the US is seeking to sever, or at least severely curb, economic ties in what has been called a \"de-coupling\". Beijing fears that the Trump administration wants a complete separation with China.\n\nThe two countries have been working to resolve their trade dispute, with the US announcing a \"phase 1\" deal with China on trade matters and suspending a scheduled tariff increase for October.\n\n\"As long as we respect each other and seek equal cooperation, there are no disagreements that cannot be resolved between China and the United States,\" Le said.\n\n\"What China wants is to deliver a better life for the Chinese people. We don't want to take anything from anyone else. There's no such thing as China replacing anyone or threatening anyone,\" he said.\n\nChina and the US have accomplished much through cooperation over the years, Le said. \"Why would we toss away the achievements of such cooperation?\"\n\nOn Monday, US President Donald Trump said efforts to end the trade war were going well.\n\nTrump said last week he hopes that the first phase of a trade deal announced earlier in October will be signed by the middle of November.\n\n\"The deal with China's coming along very well. They want to make a deal,\" Trump told reporters before a US Cabinet meeting, stressing the toll that US tariffs have taken on the Chinese economy. \"They sort of have to make a deal,\" he added, \"because their supply chain is going down the tubes.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the administration delayed raising tariffs on another $250bn of Chinese goods to 30 percent from 25 percent.\n\nTit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the US and China over the past 15 months have sent financial markets roiling and resulted in a sharp drag on global economic growth.\n\nPressure is mounting from the international community for the two powers to work out their differences.\n\nLast week, the International Monetary Fund forecast that fallout from the US-China trade war - and other trade disputes across the world - will slow global growth in 2019 to three percent, the slowest pace in a decade.", "description": "China's vice foreign minister says China doesn't want to 'take anything from anyone else'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/170686dff4a34e09988a9b35cda5ba80_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
