That is a crime.\u201d\n\nHarris began by saying, \u201c[W]e\u2019re talking about a private corporation, Twitter, that has terms of use. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, and I think most people would say, including members of Congress who he has threatened, that he has lost his privileges and it should be taken down.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cHe does not have a right to commit a crime because he is president of the United States. He does not have the right to threaten witnesses and threaten their safety because he is president of the United States. In fact, that\u2019s the very problem with Donald Trump. He thinks he\u2019s above the law, and we cannot keep reinforcing that. And anyone who wants to say, well, this is a matter of free speech, you are not free to threaten the life of a witness. That is a crime.\u201d\n\nHarris later stated, \u201cWe have to have a very serious conversation about what should be the rules placed on these private corporations, and in that context, Twitter has a responsibility.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "During an interview with CNN on Tuesday, 2020 presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) responded to arguments that her push to ban President | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Kamala-Harris-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
