(AP) \u2014 Maybe the \u201cGood Day Sacramento\u201d reporter just thought he\u2019d drive a little more traffic to his television station\u2019s website when he climbed on top of a classic 1950s Thunderbird convertible and struck a silly pose, putting his feet on its pristine yellow paint job.\n\nInstead, Angel Cardenas drew criticism of car-wreck proportions with his live broadcast for KMAX-TV from Sunday\u2019s Sacramento International Auto Show. In the end it earned him his walking papers.\n\nCardenas began his live broadcast from the car show by saying he felt like a kid in a candy store with no one around to enforce any rules.\n\nIt was hours before the show was to open, he added, and no one was there to keep him off the cars, many of which he reported were off-limits.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m just going to live on the wild side,\u201d he said before climbing onto the trunk of a yellow T-bird convertible.\n\nNext up, he yanked open the door of a pink 1957 T-Bird, accidentally dinging its door against a green T-Bird parked next to it.\n\n\u201cOh no, I hit that other car,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, looking around furtively, he quickly added, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone saw it.\u201d\n\nHe ended the segment with a grand finale of sorts, ignoring a \u201ckeep off\u201d sign placed in front of a new Ford hybrid SUV and leaping onto its hood. The result was a loud crashing sound and the voice of someone off camera yelling, \u201cGet off.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh boy, I\u2019m going to get in trouble,\u201d Cardenas says.\n\nThe car show\u2019s producer, Stacey Castle Bascom, told the Sacramento Bee that KMAX officials told her Monday Cardenas had been fired.\n\nKMAX and Cardenas did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press on Tuesday, and Cardenas was not pictured as among the \u201cGood Day Sacramento\u201d staff on the station\u2019s website.\n\nCardenas says on his personal website he\u2019s worked in all forms of broadcast news, including as reporter, anchor and camera operator in a career of more than a dozen years at several TV and radio stations.\n\nBascom said none of the cars were damaged but that the show\u2019s producers were outraged nonetheless.\n\nIndeed, Cardenas, who seemed to admire the cars, had violated a key tenet of the classic car community: You don\u2019t touch another person\u2019s ride without their permission, let alone jump all over it.\n\n\u201cThese are antiques, and in many ways, objects d\u2019art,\u201d one Facebook poster explained. \u201cOne doesn\u2019t do this in a museum.\u201d\n\nMore: Megyn Kelly on Fox News calls on NBC to allow outside investigation into Matt Lauer accusations\n\nMore: New book focuses on Jackie Kennedy\u2019s years as a reporter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/23/tv-reporter-fired-climbing-classic-cars-during-live-broadcast/4072922002/", "description": "\u201cGood Day Sacramento\u201d reporter Angel Cardenas was fired over his live broadcast for KMAX-TV from Sunday\u2019s Sacramento International Auto Show.", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published P.M.
