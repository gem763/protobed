Ernst & Young has received roughly $230,000 from ICE this fiscal year, but it made over $2 million working with the agency in 2018.\n\nIn a statement provided to VICE, Ernst & Young distanced itself from its work with ICE:\n\nWe have been hired by the Federal Government to provide business management support, including financial controls and data management for the Homeland Security CFO \u2013 nothing involving policy. We do not and would not engage in work that we believe will conflict with our values, purpose, culture and what we believe we need to do to build a better working world.\n\nAs one of the global accounting giants that comprises the \u201cBig Four,\u201d Ernst & Young doesn\u2019t come close to needing money from ICE to remain solvent. The money it has received from ICE in recent years pales in comparison to its total global revenue, which increased by 8 percent in the most recent fiscal year to $36.4 billion.\n\nThe firm joins billion-dollar companies including Amazon, Palantir, AT&T, and Wayfair that are providing services to ICE. As ICE has increased its documented poor treatment of immigrants under the Trump administration, activists have launched campaigns calling for the boycott of companies like Microsoft and Amazon due to their continued work with the agency.\n\nWhile a small number of activists have condemned Ernst & Young for its work with the agency, the firm has yet to become the target of a concentrated boycotting effort. But earlier this week, it did face backlash following a report that it held a training seminar in June 2018 in which women employees were told to conform to sexist beauty and behavior standards, including not making face-to-face conversation with men and wearing flattering clothing that wasn\u2019t too revealing.\n\nAfter news of the seminar went viral, the company issued an apology.\n\n\"This voluntary program, which was delivered to a small group of EY professionals, does not reflect EY\u2019s values or culture and should not have been offered to any of our women,\u201d a spokesperson from the firm told The Hill earlier this week.\n\nThis post has been updated to include a statement from the company.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.", "description": "The accounting firm made news this week for its sexist trainings.
