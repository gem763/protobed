Its founder, Bob Murray, has aspired to be the last man standing in an industry suffering a long decline. He is stepping down as chief executive but will serve as chairman of the board for the company\u2019s new incarnation, according to a statement.\n\nCritically for retired miners, Murray Energy is the last large coal operator paying into the pension fund of the United Mine Workers of America. That fact has made strange bedfellows out of Murray and UMWA retirees: He is infamously anti-union as a boss, yet his continued payments into the pension fund have helped keep it afloat for years.\n\nBut through bankruptcy proceedings Murray Energy will very likely be able to shed much of its pensions obligation, threatening a fund that is already on the brink of insolvency. This could lead to pensions being cut within a year, according to the UMWA. As the union\u2019s president, Cecil Roberts, put it in a statement, \u201cWe have seen this sad act too many times before.\u201d The pension fund covers roughly 86,000 retirees.\n\nRobert Murray's coal company filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 29, 2019.

Company bankruptcies and falling employment have hit the pension fund hard. The union says there are around 12 inactive miners drawing pensions from the fund for every current worker whose employer is making contributions \u2015 an unsustainable ratio that the Murray bankruptcy will make even worse.\n\nHuffPost spoke earlier this year with retired miners who had worked decades for the pensions they now collect. The modest monthly checks \u2015 around $1,000 for many \u2015 serve as a lifeline. Roger Merriman, a retiree who put in 28 years at the Federal #2 Mine in West Virginia, told HuffPost that if pensions are cut, the bankruptcy process deserves a significant share of the blame.\n\n\u201cA lot of it falls on the downturn of the coal market. But a lot of it falls on the bankruptcy courts, allowing these companies to walk away from their obligations,\u201d said Merriman, whose old mine is out of operation. \u201cA company files for bankruptcy, we are the last in line to get our money.\u201d\n\nPhil Smith, a UMWA spokesman, said the union has been expecting a bankruptcy filing from Murray Energy for a long time, particularly after the company announced earlier this month that it had missed payments on its debt. The union has projected that the pension fund will become insolvent by 2022 or 2023, leading to deep cuts in once-guaranteed monthly payments, and the latest development does not alter that timeline much.\n\nBut the news is no less painful, Smith said. He suspects that the bankruptcy could prompt the pension fund\u2019s trustees to cut payments for retirees by next September. Meanwhile, Murray will probably escape a large share of its liabilities in the retiree health fund as well, jeopardizing a program that provides health coverage to thousands of former miners.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Murray Energy is the last big employer paying into the union pension fund.
