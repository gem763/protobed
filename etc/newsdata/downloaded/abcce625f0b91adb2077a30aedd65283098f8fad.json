McGrath\u2019s third-quarter fundraising total outpaces that of several presidential candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who raised $4.8 million in the third quarter, and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who raised $6 million in the third quarter.\n\nIn a statement, Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager, claimed, \u201cChange is coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitch McConnell has never faced an opponent like Amy McGrath. Not only does a new independent poll show the race tied, but more than a quarter-million grassroots donations-from all 120 Kentucky counties-have provided us a record-shattering first quarter of nearly $11 million to take down McConnell and his self-serving special interest allies. Change is coming,\u201d said Mark Nickolas, McGrath\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nMcConnell, who has represented Kentucky in the United States Senate since 1985, has received an endorsement from President Donald Trump. In 2016, Trump won the state of Kentucky by 30 percentage points.\n\nShortly after announcing her bid to unseat McConnell, McGrath received praise from many of Hollywood\u2019s far-left figures, including Bette Midler, Chelsea Handler, Patton Oswalt, and Stephen King.\n\nFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.", "description": "Amy McGrath, a top Democrat challenging Mitch McConnell in the Kentucky Senate race, raised nearly $11 million in the third quarter of 2019.", "authors": ["Kyle Morris"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Amy-McGrath-Dem19-challenger-Kentucky-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
