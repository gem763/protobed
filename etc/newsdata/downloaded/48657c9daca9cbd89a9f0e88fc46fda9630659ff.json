Here's how the largest volcanic eruptions measure up.\n\nThe Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) ranks eruptions by size and power. The scale goes from VEI-0 to VEI-8. It measures ash, lava, and rock ejected.\n\nVEI-0 are usually a steady trickle of lava instead of an explosion. An example is the Hawaiian volcano of K\u012blauea.\n\nNext is VEI-1, a gentle eruption that can happen frequently. Italy's Mt. Stromboli has been erupting almost continuously for 2,000 years.\n\nVEI-2s consist of several mild explosions a month. Indonesia's Mount Sinabung has been erupting since 2013.\n\nVEI-3 are catastrophic eruptions that happen every few months. Lassen Peak in Northern California had a VEI-3 in 1915.\n\nVEI-4s happen about every other year. In 2010, Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull grounded thousands of flights.\n\nAt VEI-5 things start getting more dramatic. Both Mt. Vesuvius (79 AD) and Mt. St. Helens (1980) were VEI-5s.\n\nVEI-6s are colossal eruptions every 100 years. The 1883 explosion of Krakatoa was the most famous of these.\n\nVEI-7 eruptions occur every 1,000 years. The most recent was Indonesia's Mt. Tambora in 1815.\n\nVEI-8 is a devastating explosive eruption every 50,000 years. The Yellowstone Caldera would reach this level if it were to erupt.\n\nLet's all just keep our cool.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This video was originally published on November 1, 2017.", "description": "Many think of Mt.
