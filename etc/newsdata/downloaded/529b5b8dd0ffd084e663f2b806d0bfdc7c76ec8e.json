But the attacks on his mental acuity, which continued after the debate ended, re-opened an issue he's tried to put to rest, signaling another nasty and personal phase in the primary race as lower-polling candidates fight to take down the front-runner.\n\nDEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY\n\nFormer Housing Secretary Julian Castro, who served in the Obama administration with Biden, landed arguably the lowest blow when he swiped at Biden\u2019s memory -- accusing him of contradicting himself on whether Americans would have to buy into his health care plan.\n\n\"You just said two minutes ago they would have to buy in. Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" Castro asked, in what appeared to be a reference to past senior moments by Biden.\n\nHowever, Biden did not say during the debate that individuals would have to buy in. Instead, he said that individuals would automatically be enrolled if they lost their jobs.\n\nBiden adviser Anita Dunn checked Castro later in the spin room, saying that his \u201ccheap shot\u201d was \u201cbased on a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Castro, who likes to talk about learning from history, clearly didn\u2019t learn from the first two debates that taking personal cheap shots at Vice President Biden actually doesn\u2019t work out that well for the candidate who throws the shot,\u201d Dunn told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Castro decided to go the route he did.\u201d\n\nOn ABC News, former Obama chief of staff Rahm Emanuel said that the way Castro handled the moment was a \u201cdisqualifier.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will come across as mean and vindictive. That\u2019s not who he is.\u201d\n\nBIDEN CAMP WARNS RIVALS, SAYS ATTACKING FORMER VP 'NOT THE WAY' TO IMPROVE POLLS\n\nBiden\u2019s team defended him in the post-debate spin-room, with deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield saying that candidates \u201chave seen, not just in the debates, but over the course of this campaign, that attacking Joe Biden is not the way to advance yourself in the polls.\u201d\n\nThe sustained attacks, though, raise concerns that barbs from longshot candidates such as Castro (who is polling in low single digits) could kneecap Biden as front-runner and leave him weakened for the general election race should he emerge the nominee.\n\nStill, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., publicly backed Castro after the debate and raised further questions about Biden\u2019s ability to carry the banner for the Democrats into 2020.\n\n\"I think we are at a tough point right now, because there\u2019s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden\u2019s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling,\" Booker told CNN in an interview. \"And I think that Castro had really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign\u2026 and has every right to call out.\u201d\n\nBiden did fumble on a number of occasions during the debate, supplying more political ammo to his rivals.\n\nAt one point he said that \u201cnobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime,\u201d which would come as great news to people like former Trump associates Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort, who are both serving prison time for non-violent offenses. His campaign later clarified he was talking about non-violent drug offenses. He also falsely claimed the Obama administration \"didn't lock people up in cages.\"\n\nFurther, he was mocked online when he urged people to spend evenings watching television and to \u201cmake sure you have the record player on at night.\u201d The reference to record players, despite having a certain hipster cachet, drew Twitter teasing while others drew attention to the lengthy, rambling answer to what was a question on racism.\n\nBooker made reference to this too in his post-debate blasting of Biden.\n\n\"At one point, he was talking about communities like mine listening to record players,\" he said. \"I don't remember the last time I saw a record player... But there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he was saying Biden is too old to be president, Booker said he was \u201cdefinitely not saying that\u201d but that the veteran politician has a habit of \u201cmeandering\u201d in his speeches.\n\n\"I want someone that can excite and energize and call us to a campaign like we saw back in '08, in '12 where we saw record turnouts and somebody that can speak to the fullness of the Democratic Party,\" he said. \"If I believed Joe Biden was that person, I wouldn't be sitting here.\"\n\nBiden, as the presumptive front-runner, has faced sustained attacks before. While he has been leading the polls since his entrance in the race, his lead has tightened amid questions over his decades-long record in the Senate and his defense of working with segregationists during the 1970s.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQuestions about his mental fitness have also surfaced repeatedly and provided fodder for his opponents. President Trump has nicknamed him \u201cSleepy Joe.\u201d Biden was dinged by The Washington Post last month when it reported that a moving military story he frequently retold had never happened and that \"almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect.\"\n\nOpponents also seized on a statement he made in August when he asked \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about Vermont?\u201d\n\nHe was in New Hampshire.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and Gregg Re contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden came under sustained and withering fire Thursday when fellow Democrats renewed their attacks on his age, memory and alleged rambling -- as his allies scolded them for the low blows and warned the approach won't pave the way to victory.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6085920578001_6085913465001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
