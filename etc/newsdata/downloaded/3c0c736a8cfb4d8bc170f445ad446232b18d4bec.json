That was unchanged from the previous estimate.\n\nWhat happened: Consumer spending was exceedingly strong in the spring, though the government trimmed its estimated increase to 4.6% from 4.7%. Households spent a bit less on takeout and other prepared foods.\n\nConsumer outlays account for almost 70% of all U.S. economic activity in the U.S. Households have been buoyed by the strongest labor market in years, which has delivered rising wages and an extremely low unemployment rate.\n\nThe decline in businesses investment was revised to 1.4% from 1.1%, reflecting a bigger drop in outlays on manufacturing-related structures. Heavy industry has been hurt by the trade fight with China, a strong U.S. dollar and faltering global economy that\u2019s led to weaker exports.\n\nAdjusted pretax corporate rose at a 3.8% clip in the second quarter. Still good, but not quite as strong as the prior 5.3%.\n\nGovernment spending, meanwhile, increased at a 4.8% pace instead of 4.5% as previously reported. State and localities spent more on construction of roads and buildings.\n\nMost other figures in the GDP report were little changed. GDP is revised twice after the initial release to take into account new or more accurate information.\n\nRead: Consumer confidence sinks to 3-month low on trade worries, softer jobs market\n\nBig picture: A look in the rearview mirror shows the economy began to slow in the spring despite robust consumer spending. The road ahead doesn\u2019t look much different.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch predict the U.S will grow about 2% in each of the final two quarters of 2019.\n\nThe biggest drag on growth is the ongoing trade fight with China. Unless that\u2019s revolved soon, the U.S. economy is likely to remain constrained. The dispute has sapped exports, manufacturing, farming and business investment. A potential effort by Democrats to impeach President Trump won\u2019t help.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201cWe expect the economy to avoid a recession, but the trade war and next year\u2019s presidential election mean the outlook is more uncertain than usual,\u201d economists at Capital Economics said.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.22% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.32% fell slightly in Thursday trades. The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.55% was little changed at 1.70%.", "description": "The U.S. economy grew more slowly in the second quarter, updated figures confirm, and is slow growth is expected to persist through the end of the year...", "authors": ["Jeffry Bartash"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS075_econom_ZG_20190925164735.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
