They will be put into rehabilitation center if necessary.\n\nThe police believed Cai's parents don't have the ability to discipline him after collecting and reviewing evidence, thus deciding to send him to a rehabilitation center.\n\nThe case triggered a heated discussion on whether the age of criminal responsibility should be lowered for minors.\n\nUpon interview with The Paper, Luo Xiang, professor with the Criminal Justice College, China University of Political Science and Law, advocated for lowering the age of criminal responsibility and suggested the age be lowered to 12 years old.\n\n\"Theoretically speaking, people of any age should bear criminal responsibility if they commit intentional homicide,\" he said.\n\nThe General Provisions of the Civil Law has lowered the age of no civil capability from 10 to 8 years old, in order to adapt to the practical needs of society, he said. So too should Criminal Law meet the same needs and requirements.\n\nPublic interest lawyer Zhao Liangshan also supported lowering the age.\n\n\"Children are precocious now; it's necessary to adjust the age of criminal responsibility,\" he said.\n\nZhao also pointed out that the dereliction of duty of Cai's guardians led him to violate another's right to life, so the guardians should also bear civil compensation according to Tort Liability Law.\n\nTong Lihua, director of a juvenile law research center in Beijing, said lowering the age is a relatively simple choice. A complete educational correction system should be set up to effectively control crimes. \"There is a system gap within educational correction for juveniles who are under 14 years old but have committed criminal crimes,\" he said.\n\nHe called for a timely revision of the law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency to clarify which departments are in charge, as well as where and how the educational correction is carried out.\n\nSome lawyers argued, however, that the age shouldn't be lowered due to individual cases.\n\nOn Saturday, lawmakers reviewed draft revisions to the law on the protection of minors and the law on the prevention of juvenile delinquency at the bimonthly session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.\n\nDuring the group discussion, many lawmakers mentioned serious crimes committed by juveniles. Zheng Gongcheng, economics professor at Renmin University of China, said it's not enough to warn offenders of the consequences if there is no criminal responsibility.", "description": "A 13-year-old boy was sent to rehabilitation center for three years for killing a 10-year-old girl in Dalian, Northeast China's Liaoning province, the harshest punishment within the current legal system for a minor, local police told Beijing News on Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db69b4ba310cf3e97a33ced.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
