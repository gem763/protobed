The people living on the islands in the Bahamas devastated by Hurricane Dorian needed them, immediately.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t sure if there was anywhere to land.\n\nFlying over the hardest-hit areas \u2014 the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama \u2014 the pilot saw homes turned to matchsticks and boats piled in heaps.\n\nHarbors, supermarkets, a public hospital, airport landing strips \u2014 all had been damaged or blown to smithereens, frustrating rescue efforts.\n\nHurricane Dorian, which made landfall on Sunday as a Category 5 hurricane and then lingered for days, not only left many residents in the most damaged islands without jobs or a place to live. It also stripped away the services required to meet their most immediate needs \u2014 like fresh water, food and medical care.", "description": "Dorian stripped the Abaco Islands and Grand Bahama of the resources needed to meet basic needs.
