Perhaps you\u2019re right. But the measure of a life is how many other lives it touches, and Kane\u2019s life has touched many people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s touched yours, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. Everything becomes yesterday\u2019s news, but we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d\n\nThe chapel is packed for Kane Walker\u2019s funeral, and tensions are running high. Around 130 people have turned up at Perry Barr crematorium in Birmingham on a bright February day to pay their last respects. It is just over a month since he died, aged 31, and those at the service are angry. How could a young man be allowed to die of pneumonia and a drug overdose in a freezing city underpass? It wasn\u2019t as if Kane was unknown to the police, outreach teams, the ambulance service or the local community. He had spent years sleeping in doorways and sheltering beneath bridges. Everybody knew Kane Walker \u2013 even if not by name. And it would seem, everybody loved him.\n\nHe was the kind of person who if you dropped your keys would come chasing you down the street with them, \u2018here you are, here you are\u2019 Oliver Obee\n\nYet here they are fighting over the legacy of his life. You can sense the unease even before the service starts. The crowd at the crematorium is divided into distinct groups. Smart girls in pinstriped suits wearing RIP Kane T-shirts, godly folk, and a band of young adults with damaged teeth who, despite their best efforts, still look the worse for wear. There is little intermingling.\n\nLike many people who grew up in care, Kane had several families \u2013 and, at the same time, none. So here today are cousins, nieces and nephews from his biological family, the foster family he spent eight years with, and his street family. Every group seems to regard the others with suspicion. Fingers are pointed, and the same question asked time and again \u2013 where were you when Kane needed you? When they aren\u2019t blaming each other, they are blaming the system.\n\nWhile Kane\u2019s biological family make it clear they don\u2019t want to talk to us, his homeless friends are more welcoming. Natalie White met him \u201cbobbing\u201d on the street four years ago. \u201cHe was joyful when I first got to know him. He didn\u2019t know what the streets were like, so we helped him. It\u2019s what friends do.\u201d White says the streets gradually wore him down. \u201cI saw him two days before he died. He was in a really bad way \u2013 physically, mentally. He\u2019d just drowned. He\u2019d gone from somebody who was really hopeful to somebody who\u2019d had enough. If the government helped more, Kane would still be here now. Everybody who\u2019s died on the streets would still be here now.\u201d\n\nWhite says she\u2019s lucky. She\u2019s not taken drugs for three years now and has rebuilt her life. She is living in nearby accommodation, and would eventually like to get a job working with homeless people. She says Kane was cursed by \u201cblack mamba\u201d \u2013 the synthetic cannabinoid also known as spice. Mamba is the street drug for rough sleepers because it is cheap. And it is deadly. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst drug in the world. It\u2019s horrible,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes you walk round like a zombie and takes away the hope.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Provided by the Walker Family\n\nIn the chapel, the priest admits he didn\u2019t know Kane personally. But, he says, he has heard positive things about a man who couldn\u2019t have had it much tougher. He tells us what little he does know of his life: that his father died in a bike crash before he was born; that he spent much of his childhood in care before being returned to his grandmother; that both his mother and grandmother died some years ago within a short space of time. As with so many people who die homeless on the streets and come from the care system, the details are pitifully scant. The priest fast forwards to Kane\u2019s final days, and the shock of his death.\n\nOliver Obee, a young artist and photographer, talks movingly about befriending Kane. \u201cEven on the worst of days, he would always ask me how I was feeling, how my day had been and if my mum was OK. I\u2019d offer to get the teas and he\u2019d be like: \u2018Nonono, I\u2019ll get them.\u2019 He\u2019d get a big handful of 2p coins and he\u2019d rustle up the coppers. He was the kind of person who if you dropped your keys would come chasing you down the street with them: \u2018Here you are, here you are!\u2019\u201d\n\nObee mentions his friend\u2019s addiction to black mamba, and says that even when high Kane tried to protect him from the drug. \u201cHe\u2019d say: \u2018Sit on the other side, I don\u2019t want the smoke to go in your face.\u2019 He was still conscientious even when under the influence. Once I was walking through town and there was another lad having a mamba attack, and I was suddenly aware of Kane appearing and saying: \u2018You\u2019ve got to call an ambulance now.\u2019 Although he was under the influence himself, he knew quicker than me what to do, and those were precious seconds saved.\u201d\n\nObee says his favourite memory is of Kane singing. \u201cOn the street he always loved to sing. He was a surprisingly good singer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was always singing, brother,\u201d shouts out one of Kane\u2019s homeless friends from the back of the church.\n\nDurcella Davis, a conservatively dressed woman in her 60s, introduces herself to the congregation as Kane\u2019s foster mother. She speaks with quiet conviction in a Jamaican lilt. \u201cWhen Kane came to me he\u2019d had 10 moves in six months. I was his last resort. He was hard work, but he had love and care from myself and the family.\u201d She says when he left her home he kept in touch throughout his life, and continued to call her Mum. \u201cHe was happy [with us]. On one occasion he told me it was the best time he\u2019d had. It was nice to know. A couple of weeks before he died he said to me: \u2018Mum, don\u2019t worry about me,\u2019 because the day before I\u2019d been crying and said: \u2018Kane you\u2019ve got to get off the streets.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Mum you taught me a lot, and everything I am now is what you taught me.\u2019 I brought him up as a Christian. His own mum wanted me to bring him up that way because I asked her, and as a Jehovah\u2019s witness we know that he\u2019ll get a resurrection.\u201d\n\nQ&A What is 'The empty doorway' - the Guardian series on people who died homeless? Show Hide An estimated 800 homeless people died in Britain in the 18 months before March 2019. Over the next few months, G2 and Guardian Cities will look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain\u2019s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life \u2013 what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths. As the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness; to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all. It is time to stop just passing by.\n\nThere is a disapproving murmur in the church. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d says a woman loudly. \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t talk about this.\u201d Mrs Davis is brought to a premature, confused finish. \u201cThank you very much everybody,\u201d she says with dignity, as she steps down.\n\nOutside the chapel, the sense of division is growing. \u201cDo you know where the wake is being held?\u201d a man with dreadlocks asks an upset woman. \u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Alexandra Davis says. \u201cThe way they shut down Mum off the stage was out of order. They need to have respect. Everybody\u2019s grieving.\u201d She looks at the man with dreadlocks. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she asks him. \u201cI\u2019m pastor Colin Rankine, the one who highlighted it [Kane Walker\u2019s plight]. I filmed Kane and fed him for four years on the streets.\u201d Her face lights up. \u201cOh yeah, you did really well. He was hugging you in the film wasn\u2019t he? My mum was the foster carer. I\u2019m Kane\u2019s sister.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexandra Davis, Kane Walker\u2019s sister. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian\n\nRankine is a controversial figure. He is an evangelical Christian who heads up his own ministry and does outreach work. Some people regard him as a saviour of Birmingham\u2019s street homeless people, while others believe he is a self-publicist who just wants to convert the homeless to his brand of Christianity. Wherever the truth lies, it is unlikely we would have learned about Kane\u2019s life without Rankine.\n\nRankine feeds, prays for and films the street homeless people of Birmingham. He says he is documenting it all because somebody has to bear witness. After Kane\u2019s death, he provided local television stations with heartbreaking footage taken in 2018 of the young man. Kane is in such distress that it is almost unwatchable. \u201cI\u2019m done now. There\u2019s no point, brother, I\u2019m not going to be here. I\u2019m not living like this no more. This ain\u2019t my life,\u201d he tells Rankine, who is trying to comfort him with a cup of tea. \u201cI\u2019m done, Colin! I\u2019m done. I\u2019m done! You\u2019ve never seen me like this before! I\u2019m done! I am done, brother. I\u2019m done. Oh God. I can\u2019t do it no more. I can\u2019t do it no more.\u201d\n\nRankine told ITV: \u201cThere are thousands of Kanes up and down the country. We as a nation can draw together. It\u2019s all about showing love. It\u2019s all about not vilifying people for being poor. Meanwhile, Obee went on TV to talk about the abuse his friend endured on the streets. \u201cKane told me that on a regular basis he was kicked, spat on; he\u2019d wake up several times and he\u2019d have been urinated on in the night. I\u2019d see him regularly with black eyes and cut. There was not a lot of help for him there and there should have been.\u201d\n\nIn mid-February, a month after Kane\u2019s death, Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, calls homelessness a \u201cmoral emergency\u201d. Speaking after a memorial service for Kane, Byrne says: \u201cWe\u2019ve just brought together homelessness charities across the city to meet with members of parliament about what we need to do to make sure there is never another homeless person dying in our city.\u201d Byrne proposes new legislation that would require public services to work together to prevent homelessness and ensure there is an independent review after every death of a homeless person, and he says it should be called Kane\u2019s law.\n\nDrug workers are having to tell people \u2018Go back on heroin because we know how to detox you on heroin, but we don\u2019t know how to detox you from mamba.\u2019 Liam Byrne\n\nIn May, Byrne enjoys a small victory when Birmingham\u2019s Safeguarding Adults board agrees to a \u201cformal multi-agency\u201d review into Kane\u2019s death. Astonishingly, it emerges that in 2017-18 it did not investigate the circumstances of a single one of the estimated 18 deaths of homeless people that occurred in the city. The council says outreach workers were reluctant to report vulnerable adults, while outreach workers tell us they simply didn\u2019t know safeguarding adult reviews (SARs) existed. Rankine tells us he passed on his concerns about Kane to the council\u2019s street intervention team, but that they were never acted on.\n\nBirmingham is a city in crisis. It may still be the UK\u2019s largest council landlord, and it may be building more council homes through Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust than any other local authority, but these facts put a deceptive gloss on the housing situation. The number of properties owned by Birmingham city council has halved since the 1980s, from more than 120,000 units to 61,000. The overall estimate is that there are now 20,000 homeless people in the city. The council receives 600 applications every month from people who fear they are about to become homeless.\n\nA rise in street homelessness inevitably leads to a rise in drug addiction, and vice versa. There were 252 deaths related to drug poisoning in the city between 2016 and 2018 \u2013 the highest number since records began in 2001. Meanwhile, the correlation between being brought up in care and adult homelessness is stark. While one in 144 children have been in care at some point in their lives, one in four homeless people have been in care.\n\nIt is July, six months since Kane Walker died, and we meet Liam Byrne in his office at Portcullis House, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Byrne\u2019s team has done research on key underlying causes of homelessness. They discovered that the mental healthcare caseload is rising four times faster than the budget, while there has been a 20% fall in funding for drug and alcohol treatment. For Byrne, the issue is personal \u2013 his father and paternal grandparents were alcoholics, and his grandmother and uncle had schizophrenia. They weren\u2019t homeless, he says, but they so easily could have been.\n\nByrne is bright, open and very emotional. He weeps twice in our presence \u2013 once when talking about a homeless double amputee he met in an underpass while doing outreach (\u201cHe was still in his hospital gown with his hospital tag on. It took us two hours to get him an ambulance\u201d) and again when describing the memorial service he attended for Kane.\n\nKane Walker Photograph: Courtesy of the Family\n\nWas he angry about Kane\u2019s death? \u201cFurious. So furious I decided to run as mayor because I can\u2019t be a bystander any more and watch people die on the streets.\u201d The election is next May, and if he wins he will stand down as an MP. How was he failed? \u201cIn Kane\u2019s case, the failure was deep in childhood. A lot of people can tell you about the effort that was made to try to help Kane in the last couple of years of his life. Some pretty serious outreach tried to catch him.\u201d But he knows it wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cWhen you have a broken care system and no mental health services and no addiction services, then it is very difficult to set people on a good path.\u201d After Kane\u2019s death it was also alleged that the ambulance service failed to get him to hospital promptly.\n\nByrne is particularly horrified by the grip spice has on homeless people. Not only is it deadly, he says, but there has been no investment in detox programmes. \u201cBecause every mix is different, drug workers are having to tell people: \u2018Go back on heroin because we know how to detox you on heroin, but we don\u2019t know how to detox you from mamba.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to ask yourself why, in Birmingham, addiction services have been cut back so dramatically when there is this epidemic of psychoactive substances that we don\u2019t know how to unravel. There wasn\u2019t an emergency drug treatment programme available to Kane because we don\u2019t know what the pathways of care look like. That is the scandal of Kane\u2019s story.\u201d\n\nAre people looking for a programme yet? \u201cI don\u2019t think they are. I don\u2019t think people give a shit.\u201d Although the coroner ruled that the principal cause of death was a heroin overdose and that a contributory cause was pneumonia, spice was found in his system. His friends are convinced it was this that killed him.\n\nSeven months after first getting in touch with Alexandra Davis, she agrees to see us. She suffers from anxiety and depression, and has struggled since Kane\u2019s death. Talking about him tends to make her feel worse, she says, so she tries to avoid the subject. We meet at St Martin\u2019s church in the Bull Ring \u2013 a bustling hub with market stalls and shops where Kane liked to hang out. She asks for one favour. \u201cPlease don\u2019t call Kane my foster brother. To me, he was my brother, and I was his sister.\u201d\n\nDavis turns up with her two children. Levi, 10, and Pearl, five, are lively, lovable and perfectly behaved. Both have fond memories of Kane. Levi shows me a photo of Kane on the day they took him to get a new phone on 20 July last year. That was an important day for all of them.\n\nKane was four when he walked into Alex\u2019s life; she was a year older. \u201cI just remember this young pale-skinned boy coming into the house. He had a big grin on his face. He looked very innocent, so happy. I was so excited.\u201d Davis\u2019s parents had taken in foster children before, and continued to do so after his arrival. But Kane was different. He stayed with them for eight years. And when he finally left, none of them wanted him to go because he was family.\n\n\u201cOur lives were relatively privileged,\u201d Davis says. \u201cWe had apple trees, plum trees, a pear tree. We\u2019d go in the garden, grab a little basket and spend time picking fruit and playing.\u201d They would ride bikes, play with her dolls. Davis was the youngest of five girls. In summer, they would all go on holiday together \u2013 Alex, her four sisters, their mother and father, Kane, and often one other fostered boy. \u201cWe\u2019d go to Prestatyn in a minivan and dad would drive us around. We\u2019d go to the beaches and stay in chalets at Pontin\u2019s. Kane used to love dancing with the human teddy bears during the holiday. We\u2019d all be dancing and enjoying ourselves.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kane Walker aged 8 with sisters Cecilia Davis(left) and Alexandra Davis. Photograph: Fabio De Paola\n\nWere they into music as kids? \u201cOh yeah. Kane loved music. His favourite song was 21 Seconds and he memorised all the lyrics. He\u2019d rap and really move to it.\u201d They used to say that Kane could be an actor when he grew up. He performed in plays at school and church, and sometimes he and Davis would put on improvised dramas at home. \u201cWe did one for Mum and Dad\u2019s anniversary about God testing Abraham\u2019s faith and telling him to kill his son. Just before he killed his son the angel came and told him to stop. I was the director and Kane was the actor. He played the part so good.\u201d He was bright, she says, but struggled with reading. \u201cI think he was a bit dyslexic.\u201d\n\nYoung Kane and Alex were inseparable. Then suddenly he wasn\u2019t there any more. She thinks she was 13 when they were told that Kane was going to live with his grandmother. Can she remember the day he left? \u201cIt was horrible. We were all crying.\u201d She later discovered her parents had hoped to adopt Kane.\n\nHe would occasionally return to visit the family, but she says he seemed different \u2013 less innocent and carefree. \u201cAfter he left my mum he got into drug-taking, and when people take drugs they get desperate don\u2019t they? I was told he was taking heroin soon after he left.\u201d After one visit when he was 16, Davis discovered her phone was missing. Her mother told her Kane had stolen it. She didn\u2019t believe her. So her parents took her round to Kane\u2019s house, where he burst out crying and admitted he had taken it. She was devastated, and broke off contact with him.\n\nFor around eight years they never saw each other, though she didn\u2019t stop thinking about him. She still doesn\u2019t know what he was doing in this time. But one of Rankine\u2019s videos provides a clue: Kane tells the pastor he and his then girlfriend had been living in council property, but became homeless after being penalised by the bedroom tax.\n\nOne day Davis saw him sitting on a street with his girlfriend. She was shocked. \u201cShe was skin and bone, like she was going to die. And he told me she was pregnant. I looked at her and thought there is no way her body would be able to maintain carrying a child. I was shocked about the state of him and his situation.\u201d He told her that both his mother and grandmother had died. When she replied that her own mother wasn\u2019t very well, Kane went ballistic. \u201cHe said: \u2018No! It\u2019s not your mum, it\u2019s my mum. Your mum is my mum,\u2019 and he gives me a big lecture. \u2018You\u2019re my sister. You\u2019re not my foster sister. She\u2019s not my foster mum. She\u2019s. My. Mum.\u2019 He said \u2018Why did they take me away from mum, because I was happy there.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom then on she saw him regularly on the streets. He told her things he had withheld when they were young. He said he had been abused as a child before he came to the Davises. \u201cI think he had wanted to protect me from it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen he got older he was very vocal about saying what had happened to him. He just blurted everything out. It was heartbreaking.\u201d\n\nWhat upset her most was seeing him sitting on the pavement. She thought he was humiliating himself. \u201cOne day, I said: \u2018I\u2019ve had enough of this. Just get up now. You weren\u2019t raised on the floor, that\u2019s not where you came from. I said: \u2018I\u2019m serious, I\u2019m sick and tired of going to sleep worried whether you\u2019re dead or alive. Get up now.\u2019 And I said: \u2018We\u2019re going to support you, get you a phone, and you will not sell this phone.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kane Walker and Alexandra Davis. Photograph: Courtesy of the Family\n\nDid he seem different? \u201cHe was troubled and agitated, but you could see he was the same Kane.\u201d Was he still smiling? She shakes her head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t smiling. I could see he was in serious difficulty.\u201d Davis might never have experienced street homelessness, but she understood what Kane was going through. She and her children had briefly ended up homeless after fleeing an abusive relationship.\n\nOver the next few months she would often meet Kane in town, and take him for a meal with the children. One day he was distraught. \u201cI said: \u2018Come here and give your sister a big hug.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I\u2019ve got HIV.\u2019 He was in tears, and I was so upset. I said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We can do this together, you can go on medication and still have a normal life.\u2019\u201d She was told he had been gang raped on the streets, but doesn\u2019t know if that was true.\n\nAfter buying him the phone, they became as close as they had been when they were children. For four months they would talk to each other every day. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just once either, he\u2019d call me eight times a day. Sometimes he\u2019d be great \u2013 \u2018Hi Alex, how are you doing, sis?\u2019 \u2013 and sometimes it was like: \u2018I don\u2019t want to live any more.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis took Kane to hospital appointments and out for meals with the children. Even though he was unkempt, she felt proud to be with him. \u201cHe had this fast, strong walk. He was so confident in town. He\u2019d be going around saying: \u2018Hi, hi,\u2019 to everyone. When I walked around town with him I felt protected. He had a swagger.\u201d Kane moved off the streets and into a hostel, and appeared to be doing well.\n\nAnd then around October last year the calls stopped. Davis learned later that his phone had been stolen. She went into town and couldn\u2019t find him. She called the local hostels, and eventually one said he had been living there but had moved out. She wasn\u2019t sure if he had left of his own accord or been kicked out. In tears, she called the police, said she was terrified for him and asked if they knew where he was. Later that night, she received a call from the police saying he\u2019d been spotted walking around town and was fine, but they could not disclose any more information. \u201cI said \u2018I\u2019ve been taking care of him, I\u2019ve been doing support work with him, I need to know where he is.\u2019 They said: \u2018Sorry, that\u2019s not information we\u2019re willing to disclose to you.\u2019 And a couple of months later my brother was dead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 9.30pm in the centre of Birmingham and Rankine\u2019s team is about to start the night\u2019s outreach. They come out armed with sandwiches, drinks and prayers. There seems to be someone sleeping rough \u2013 or trying to sleep \u2013 in every nook and cranny of the city. Dave is in his late 60s, has a gammy leg and has been sleeping rough for most of his adult life. Sam, in his 20s, split up from his girlfriend three weeks ago and is begging outside a pub. He has no addiction issues, but you wonder what state he will be in if he doesn\u2019t get support soon. He says he won\u2019t touch the hostels because they are full of booze, drugs and violence. A story we hear time and again \u2013 all over the country.\n\nHomelessness is now part of all our lives. Here's what you can do to help Read more\n\nRankine asks the homeless people whether they will pray with him, and tells them he is baptising at the weekend if they are interested. Some actively want to pray with him, some agree to, and a few tell him to get lost. \u201cFuck off, I don\u2019t want to be ambushed by a priest!\u201d shouts one man. Rankine smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s OK,\u201d he tells us. \u201cHe\u2019ll be begging for that prayer in a couple of weeks. These streets are not nice. If he doesn\u2019t pray, who\u2019s going to protect him tonight when he\u2019s sleeping? I know guys who will come along, start searching his things and stamp on his head. If that guy dies tonight, he\u2019ll do so without a prayer.\u201d Rankine may not be to everybody\u2019s taste, but he clearly has a genuine relationship with many of Birmingham\u2019s street homeless.\n\nIt\u2019s midnight and we\u2019re in the grounds of St Philip\u2019s Cathedral, known as Pigeon Park \u2013 a common meeting place for the homeless and outreach workers. A group of young people gather. There are two main topics of conversation \u2013 black mamba and the latest roll-call of street deaths. Whatever postmortems may show, they are sure it\u2019s mamba that\u2019s killing the homeless. One drag and it can be fatal, they say. They talk among themselves about the recent death of Fungi, who starred in the reality TV show Benefits Street. Fungi did not die on the streets, but he had been homeless on and off for many years, and was much loved.\n\nDan and Rachel are recovering addicts who were friends of Kane. With the help of Rankine, they have managed to get off the streets and are now living in decent accommodation. Tonight they are out to catch up with homeless friends and chat. Things are good, they say, but they miss their street family.\n\nRachel and Dan are discussing Kane\u2019s final day and why paramedics didn\u2019t take him to hospital when they were called to him early in the morning. Another friend had called an ambulance because he was delirious and appeared to be overdosing. Kane refused to be seen by the paramedics, putting his sleeping bag over his head and saying he wanted to sleep. Rachel and Dan say he was in no fit state to make that decision, and that if he had been taken to hospital his life could have been saved. Other friends also say this to us. An ambulance was again called to Kane that afternoon, but when it arrived he was no longer breathing. He was confirmed dead at the scene at 4.16pm on 27 January this year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pastor Colin Rankine, who documented Kane\u2019s life in the course of his outreach work.

Miguel was in his 20s and died in the doorway of a Lloyds bank. There are cellophane-wrapped flowers and a banner with pictures of a smiling young man saying: \u201cYou are unforgettable Miguel.\u201d The message has been smudged by the rain and is fast becoming illegible.\n\nWest Midlands ambulance service confirms it was called out twice to treat Kane that day \u2013 first at 8.27am, then at 3.39pm. \u201cAfter assessing the patient,\u201d it says, \u201cthe crew discharged him noting that the patient had refused treatment; they provided advice to Mr Walker\u2019s friends at the scene that they should call 999 immediately if they had further concerns. No further calls were received until 3.39pm. The second call was to the same location \u2026 Unfortunately, despite advanced life support, it was not possible to save Mr Walker.\u201d\n\nWhen invited to respond to comments made by Kane\u2019s friends about the treatment he received, the ambulance service says: \u201cBased on the comments the paper [the Guardian] has provided, a senior clinician has been assigned to review these two cases [the two callouts to Kane] to examine if there is any learning that can be taken from them. We would welcome the opportunity to speak to any of Mr Walker\u2019s friends who have concerns.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kane in 2015 alongside Oliver Obee\u2019s portrait of him, on display in Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.

Kane\u2019s law is no nearer to becoming a reality, and Byrne says if he is elected mayor next May he hopes to introduce localised legislation in Birmingham. But there is another problem. While Byrne talks about the importance of safeguarding adult reviews for every death of a homeless person so we can discover everything that went wrong, the council won\u2019t even share basic information with us about Kane\u2019s life, such as whether he had care-leaver status (ie, was a care leaver at 16), what support he received, and whether anybody from the council\u2019s vulnerable adults team was assigned to him. When we ask about Kane\u2019s care record, the council says it will not provide this \u201cwithout someone\u2019s explicit permission\u201d. But in this case it is not apparent whose permission it would seek; WKane\u2019s parents and grandparents are dead, and he has no obvious next of kin.\n\nBack in the Bull Ring, Alex tells us that Kane\u2019s dream was to start a foundation for homeless people providing food, counselling and therapy. She would love to do that on his behalf, but says she hasn\u2019t got a clue where to start. She is still putting her faith in Kane\u2019s law, and has a simple question for Byrne: \u201cWhen will Kane\u2019s law come into effect, because I can see plenty of homeless people sitting on the floor around Birmingham. It seems to me there is a lot of talk and not enough action.\u201d\n\nThe homeless death of Jake Humm: 'It was my deepest, darkest fear' Read more\n\nShe talks about the happy times she shared with her brother, and shows us a photograph of her and Kane together alongside a moving and detailed drawing of him. It was taken last year and means so much to her. \u201cOne day he said: \u2018Come! Come!\u2019 And I was like: \u2018Where are you taking me?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I want to show you something.\u2019 He goes: \u2018People say I\u2019m nothing, but I\u2019m somebody. I\u2019m famous. I\u2019m in Birmingham Art Gallery.\u2019 And I went: \u2018Liar, I don\u2019t believe you.\u2019 And he said: \u2018Come on, I\u2019ll show you.\u2019 So I\u2019m running because he was walking so fast, and it was a really hot summer. And we got to the gallery and there it was. And I was like: \u2018Oh my God! You are in Birmingham Art Gallery.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I told you!\u2019\u201d The portrait is by Obee, who gave a eulogy at Kane\u2019s funeral. Davis zooms in on the photo. \u201cLook at his eyes. He\u2019s smiling with his eyes.\u201d\n\nAfter their visit to the gallery, he went back to his hostel and spruced himself up. That night Kane called Davis. \u201cHe said: \u2018Alex, I\u2019ve had a wash and my clothes have been washed.\u2019 He was so happy. He said, \u2018See sis, I told you. I am somebody.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.
