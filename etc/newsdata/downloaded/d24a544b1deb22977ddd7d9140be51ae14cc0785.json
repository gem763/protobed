As a result, Robert knew he\u2019d risk being charged with murder, and thus he resolved to flee the village with husband Aaron at his side. However, things get a tad more complicated tonight, when the police begin asking questions.\n\nLast night, an emotional Victoria informed her brother that Lee had died. Robert was devastated, as he knew the rapist\u2019s death could result in him being charged with murder and thus have to spend life in prison.\n\nAs Robert discussed his options, Liv provided him with an answer, as she suggested that he could go on the run with Aaron.\n\nAfter some deliberation, they agreed to do just that and Aaron headed off to inform mum Chas (Lucy Pargeter) of his plan and, although she was horrified at the prospect of losing her son, she ultimately bid him farewell, as both he and Robert drove off to start their new life together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the reality of the situation will no doubt hit those who remained behind in the village during tonight\u2019s episode, as the police begin to ask questions.\n\nWith Lee having only recently died, the police are sure to put two and two together when they realise that Robert and Aaron have vanished.\n\nThe question is: will Robert and Aaron manage to get out of dodge before the law tracks them down?\n\nWhat\u2019s more, will Chas and Liv be able to remain calm knowing what they know, as the police investigate?\n\nEmmerdale continues on Wednesday 16th October at 7pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "But will they manage to track Robert and Aaron down?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot-2019-10-16-at-09.26.31-d7ce_1571214694.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
