Combine the meat with the spring onions and cheese and form into 4 patties that would fit the buns. Wrap each patty in a slice of bacon. Heat the olive oil in pan over medium heat and fry the patties off until lightly charred and cooked to your liking, 2-3 minutes per side.\n\nTo serve, top the base of each toasted bun with some of the mayo. Add some lettuce leaves, gherkins and the first patty on top. Add the ham, second patty and fried egg. Top the burger off with the salsa and top half of the bun. Serve the wedges with the remaining mayo for dipping. Serve with Windhoek beer.\n\nTIP: To make quick potato wedges, prick a few potatoes with a fork and microwave for 4 minutes on each side. Slice the potatoes into wedges and fry off in hot oil until golden and crisp, 2-3 minutes.\n\nIn partnership with Windhoek.", "description": "A meaty monster burger with all the layers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9428/38d49d6b55994170a27c70af5dc17080.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
