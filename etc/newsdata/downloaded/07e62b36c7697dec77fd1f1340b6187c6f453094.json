A few were more sceptical of how this would be enforced.\n\nOne man on Facebook said: \"Yeah, so instead of having designated areas, now people will just shoot of (sic) fireworks randomly. So we will see an increase in injuries, fires and more animals will be hurt. Just because something is law, doesn't mean people will actually follow it. And who will police this? SAPS that don't answer their phones? Law Enforcement who only man their phones until 5pm?\"\n\nAnother commented: \"That's great but won't it be interpreted as a free for all to shoot crackers just anywhere?\"\n\nSmith reminded residents that they could be liable to a R200 fine if they used or detonated fireworks in a building or public thoroughfare, in terms of the Explosives Act.\n\n\"Selling fireworks to a child or anyone under the age of 16 is liable to a R300 fine [and] allowing a child or person under the age of 16 to handle fireworks without adult supervision is liable to a R300 fine.\"\n\nThose who wish to report the illegal sale or use of fireworks can call the City's Public Emergency Call Centre on 107 from a landline, or 021 480 7700 from a cellphone, or the South African Police Service on 10111.", "description": "There has been a largely positive reaction to the news that the City of Cape Town will not have any designated sites for fireworks this year.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8123/522b3c8e457b4101acd951bce4e35aa0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
