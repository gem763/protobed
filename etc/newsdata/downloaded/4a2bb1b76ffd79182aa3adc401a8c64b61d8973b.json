BNEF also explains that the deal Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and BMW struck with California last week to avoid the full rollback will not undo most of the damage.\n\nIn the second, BNEF concluded that the rapid price drops in the cost of batteries that have driven the energy storage and EV revolutions this decade will continue for the next decade.\n\nIn short, while Trump can slow adoption of high-efficiency EVs in the United States, other countries \u2014 the E.U. and especially China \u2014 will simply keep adopting them so quickly that he cannot stop the global EV revolution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s pro-oil moves ensure only that U.S. companies and workers are far less likely to be the major beneficiaries of this massive job-creating revolution.\n\nSince his election, Trump has been working overtime to pay back his Big Oil backers \u2014 who have been major donors both to his campaign and to the Republican Party. Not only has he been pushing expanded drilling for climate-destroying fossil fuels, but he has also embraced policies that would increase U.S. dependency on oil.\n\nTrump\u2019s biggest effort to date is his plan to roll back President Barack Obama\u2019s fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for new cars. That rollback would cost consumers nearly $100 billion dollars in missed fuel savings \u2014 a net cost to individual car buyers of $1,650 each (even after accounting for the higher vehicle cost) as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concluded in its final January \u201cDetermination on the Appropriateness\u201d of the standards.\n\nRolling back the standards would also boost U.S. oil consumption by a stunning 1.2 billion gallons over the lifetime of the model-year 2022\u20132025 cars. It would also increase U.S. carbon pollution by 540 billion tons over that time period. But the EPA didn\u2019t look at the impact on cars built after 2025 that would also be subject to the weaker standards, so we don\u2019t know the full scale of the negative impact of Trump\u2019s efforts.\n\nAnd while the car companies themselves asked for relief from the deal they had made with the Obama administration, the bad publicity surrounding the full Trump rollback led many to negotiate a deal with California that preserved some of the benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCalifornia has long held a waiver giving it the ability to set its own, tougher, fuel efficiency standards. And since the state has such a huge car-centric economy, these tougher standards have forced car companies to meet the state\u2019s standards. At the same time, over a dozen other states now use California\u2019s standards.\n\nAccording to BNEF, if California\u2019s new standards were \u201cadopted nationally, it would require around half the EV sales share to close the gap between automakers\u2019 performance and their targets,\u201d compared to Obama\u2019s original standards.\n\nBut most states don\u2019t use the California standards, so they would use Trump\u2019s instead, which requires no EV sales. And that means the total impact of the California standards would be to restore far less than half the EV sales that the Obama standard required.\n\nTrump\u2019s policies are therefore doubly tragic. First, his lower standards mean much higher carbon pollution in this country. Second, the EV revolution is unstoppable globally. So, throttling back the national EV market merely leaves U.S. car companies and workers lagging behind in the most important vehicle revolution in a century.\n\nAccording to BNEF, from 2010 through 2018 the average lithium-ion battery pack dropped a remarkable 85% in price \u2014 and they predict \u201ca further halving of lithium-ion battery costs per kilowatt-hour by 2030, as demand takes off in two different markets \u2013 stationary storage and electric vehicles.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElectric vehicle sales are now seriously eating into internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle sales \u2014 and that trend is projected to accelerate in the coming years.\n\nSales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are rising so fast that total sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have already peaked.\n\nNo wonder countries like China are investing so heavily in EVs, and putting in place much stronger fuel efficiency standards and EV requirements.\n\nBut just as Trump looks backward in his efforts to promote the climate-destroying fuels of the twentieth century, he also looks backward to promote the inefficient, highly polluting internal combustion engine cars of the last century.\n\nThat\u2019s why killing electric cars will serve only to kill U.S. jobs and the climate.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-electric-cars-China.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}
