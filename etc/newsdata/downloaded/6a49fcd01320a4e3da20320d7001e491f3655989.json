(AP)\n\nThe XFL is holding its draft on Tuesday and Wednesday, and like many things with the re-start of the upstart league, it\u2019s a little different.\n\nFor one thing, teams weren\u2019t able to draft quarterbacks, at least not those believed to be starters. The XFL said that in the interest of parity, quarterbacks were assigned.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nOn Tuesday morning, it announced those assignments.\n\n\u201cOur head coaches are excited about this first wave of quarterback assignments and the talent level in our draft pool,\u201d XFL commissioner Oliver Luck said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to identify and sign the best players available, and we are confident this is a strong start to the next two days.\u201d\n\nDallas Renegades: Landry Jones\n\nJones was the first player to sign with the XFL, which was announced in August. A third-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2013, Jones spent five seasons with Pittsburgh as a backup and also was with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders. He will be reunited with his college head coach at Oklahoma, Bob Stoops, with the Renegades; Stoops is the coach/general manager in Dallas.\n\nD.C. Defenders: Cardale Jones\n\nA fourth-round pick of the Buffalo Bills in 2016, Jones was traded to the Chargers in 2017 and spent two seasons with the team. He was briefly with the Seattle Seahawks last month. Jones led Ohio State to a national championship at the end of the 2014 season in just his third career start. Pep Hamilton, who guided Andrew Luck at Stanford and with the Indianapolis Colts, is D.C.\u2019s head coach/GM.\n\nHouston Roughnecks: Phillip Walker\n\nStory continues\n\nThough he was undrafted in 2017, Walker spent 2017 and \u201918 on the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 practice squad. The all-time leading passer at Temple, he led the Owls to the first back-to-back bowl appearances in school history, as well as their first conference title in nearly 50 years in 2016. Walker will play for June Jones, the Roughnecks\u2019 coach/GM.\n\nLos Angeles Wildcats: Luis Perez\n\nPerez has worn many jerseys over the last year or so: he spent the 2018 offseason and preseason with the Los Angeles Rams, then was drafted by the Birmingham Iron of the AAF. After the AAF went down in flames, he spent a month of the spring with the Philadelphia Eagles and just four days of the preseason with the Detroit Lions. The Wildcats\u2019 coach/GM is longtime NFL assistant Winston Moss.\n\nNew York Guardians: Matt McGloin\n\nUndrafted out of Penn State in 2013, McGloin was with the Oakland Raiders from 2013-16, starting seven games in that time (six as a rookie). He was with the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2017 offseason and training camp, and was also briefly with the Houston Texans and Kansas City Chiefs. Kevin Gilbride, who was the New York Giants\u2019 offensive coordinator for their Super Bowl wins in 2007 and \u201911, is New York\u2019s head coach/GM.\n\nSt. Louis BattleHawks: Jordan Ta\u2019amu\n\nTa\u2019amu is the youngest quarterback of this bunch. Invited to the scouting combine this year but not drafted, he was signed by the Texans on Aug. 7 and released on Aug. 30. The starter at Ole Miss last year, Ta\u2019amu led the SEC in passing yards per game and total offense. Longtime Cincinnati Bengals tight ends coach Jonathan Hayes is the head coach/GM in St. Louis.\n\nSeattle Dragons: Brandon Silvers\n\nSilvers\u2019 time on an NFL roster is short: He was with the New York Jets for a month this spring. He also played for the AAF, with the Memphis Express, starting two games. Silvers was a four-year starter at Troy, leading the team to an 11-2 mark as a senior, the best record in school history. Seattle\u2019s head coach/GM is a familiar name in the city: Jim Zorn, the first quarterback in Seahawks franchise history.\n\nTampa Bay Vipers: Aaron Murray\n\nMurray is a Tampa native who was a fifth-round pick of the Chiefs in 2014. He spent two years with Kansas City and after a week-long stint with the Cardinals, Murray spent time on the Eagles\u2019 practice squad. He also played for the Atlanta AAF team. Murray was a four-year starter at Georgia who threw 71 touchdowns over the 2011-12 seasons. Marc Trestman is the head coach/GM of the Vipers.\n\nThe XFL notified player agents of the league pay structure last week; if a player is active for all 10 regular-season games on a .500 team, he\u2019ll earn $55,000. However, these quarterbacks will earn roughly 10 times what the rest of their teammates will.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "In advance of the start of its draft, the XFL announced quarterback assignments.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/08AMSXHqEGkvJCt4S8wujA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZChQE4LiFIyJjywlgcLiOA--~B/aD0yNDQ3O3c9NDM1MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/69637200-ef5e-11e9-bfbb-bdbc5d338146", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
