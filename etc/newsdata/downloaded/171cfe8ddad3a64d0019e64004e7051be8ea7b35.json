They\u2019re merely nervous when my dog approaches. Trump is petrified as Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff close in.\n\n\u201cCrazy Nancy,\u201d he said at a recent rally in Dallas, where his epic self-pity and all-consuming grudges took center stage. \u201cThink of that. That crazy Nancy. She is crazy. And shifty Schiff. How about this guy? He makes up my conversation, which was perfect. He makes up my conversation. He sees what I said. It doesn\u2019t play well because it was perfect.\u201d Give the president a thesaurus and a therapist, though not necessarily in that order.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe do-nothing Democrats have betrayed our country, and that great betrayal is over. We are finally again , and we\u2019ve been doing it now for almost three years.\u201d Doing what? Again how? This wasn\u2019t a speech; it was a puzzle. \u201cCan you believe we\u2019ve been doing this for three years? Can you believe it? I\u2019ve been a politician for three years. I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d Trust me, President Trump. Your incredulity is no match for mine.\n\nIt has been the case from the start that Trump communicates like no president before him. That\u2019s principally because he miscommunicates like no president before him. And while his verbal errors and infelicities are largely accidental, they\u2019re hardly incidental.\n\nThey\u2019re a semantic complement to his flouting of tradition and junking of norms. They help prevent him from being tagged as one of the elitists he rails against. No snob would spell so sloppily or use capital letters with such abandon. No snob would be so lavish with schoolyard slurs. No snob would thrash and flail his way through sentences the way he does. On Twitter in particular, Trump doesn\u2019t exclaim; he expectorates. You can feel the spittle several time zones away.\n\nAnd Twitter suits him not just because of its immediacy and reach. It\u2019s a format so abridged and casual that botched grammar isn\u2019t necessarily equated with stupidity; it could simply be the consequence of haste or convenience. Formally written letters follow rules and demand etiquette. For Twitter all you need is a keypad and a spleen.\n\nBut Trump seems even more splenetic of late. He raged for nearly 90 minutes in Dallas a week and a half ago. He raged for more than 70 in that wild cabinet meeting on Monday, when he claimed three times in a row, as if stuttering, that being president had cost him between $2 billion and $5 billion; erroneously said that he was the first president to forgo a salary; ridiculously boasted that Miami\u2019s airport might be the world\u2019s busiest (it\u2019s not even in the top 20); dismissed the emoluments clause of the Constitution as \u201cphony\u201d; and careered from one fantasy to the next, covering so much territory with so little truthfulness that media fact checkers devoted long articles to correcting the record.", "description": "The president needs a thesaurus and a therapist, though not necessarily in that order.", "authors": ["Frank Bruni"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/opinion/sunday/27bruni/27bruni-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
