It is illegal to sell skin cream products in the USA with 1 ppm or more of mercury.\n\nDr. Cyril Wecht, a forensic pathologist based in Pittsburgh, told ABC News that these levels of toxicity would develop \"not immediately, but pretty quickly.\"\n\nWhile signs and symptoms vary person to person, Wecht added that in this patient's case \"It depends if she was using it every day and how long she was keeping it on.\"\n\nSacramento County Public Health said this is the first reported case of methylmercury poisoning of this type linked to a skin cream in the U.S., though multiple cases of mercury poisoning due to tainted skin-lightening creams purchased through informal networks and originating in Mexico have been described and detailed by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMercury exposure can occur by including swallowing it, inhaling vapors and absorbing it from the skin; but the most common cause of toxic mercury exposure is by eating mercury-contaminated fish.\n\n\"With facial cream, exposure occurs by absorption after application to the skin, inhalation of the vapor and hand-to-mouth behavior leading to ingestion,\" Kelly explained. \"The effects of an exposure depend on many factors including the form of mercury (i.e. organic or inorganic), the amount, the length of time exposed, the mechanism of the exposure and the age and health condition of the exposed person.\"\n\nIn terms of reversibility, Wecht said that depends on \"how long the damage had been going on and how quickly it was recognized.\"\n\n\"From [a] neurological standpoint, it's hard to comment on reversibility of her symptoms,\" he said. \"Effects of intoxication have a psychological component as well as a neurologic component. I have seen cases that have resulted in death.\"\n\nThe California Department of Public Health issued a health alert that outlines the full list of signs and symptoms, as well as the prolonged exposure and effects.\n\nPonds and Unilever, its parent company, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.", "description": "A Sacramento, California woman was in a semi-comatose state after she used face cream that contained high levels of mercury.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/skin-cream-stock-gty-jef-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
