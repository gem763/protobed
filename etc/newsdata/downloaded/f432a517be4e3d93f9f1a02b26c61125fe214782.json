Even one week ago, a one-on-one meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy would have been seen largely as an afterthought.\n\nBut Trump's meeting on Wednesday with Zelenskiy will come just days after revelations that the president urged his Ukrainian counterpart in a July phone call to investigate the activities of the son of former Vice-President Joe Biden. Trump said he was concerned about corruption; Democrats frame his actions as an effort to pressure Zelenskiy to dig up damaging material on a potential 2020 rival.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, seen in this photo from last August, is scheduled to meet with Trump at the summit. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images)\n\nThat pressure is the subject of a whistleblower's complaint that the administration has refused to turn over to members of Congress, setting up a showdown with Democrats.\n\nTrump is defending himself against the intelligence official's complaint, asserting that it comes from a \"partisan whistleblower,\" though the president also said he doesn't know the whistleblower's identity.\n\nHe insisted Sunday his conversation with Zelenskiy was \"absolutely perfect.\" But Democrats believe it shows that Trump is emboldened to seek foreign help for his reelection effort.\n\nTrade war troubles\n\nThere are plenty of other concerns in the mix during Trump's UN visit, including the U.S. trade war with China.\n\nBut China's Xi Jinping is not expected to attend, nor are several other prominent world leaders, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nAmong the nations whose leaders Trump plans to meet in New York: Iraq, Poland, Egypt, Pakistan, South Korea and Japan. He will also meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, clinging to power after failed attempts to steer his nation out of the European Union.\n\nTrump's annual address to the General Assembly is scheduled for Tuesday. Two years ago, he used the moment to deride North Korea's Kim Jong-un as \"Little Rocket Man\" and threaten to destroy North Korea.\n\nA year ago, he drew laughter when he used his speech to recite his administration's accomplishments.\n\nHis theme this year, according to aides, will be to reassert America's determination to uphold its sovereignty and independence, especially on issues of national security.\n\nBut others may push a different path.\n\n\"There's an attempt to push back against the unilateralism, against the isolationism, against the populism that has affected not only the United States but other countries as well,\" said Jeffrey Feltman of the Brookings Institution. \"I don't know how effective this will be, but it's an example of how some of our traditional allies are organizing themselves in response to the feeling that the United States, the U.K., that other sort of major engines in the UN system no longer are pressing the accelerator.\"", "description": "Faced with growing tumult at home and abroad, U.S. President Donald Trump heads into his three-day visit to the United Nations this week hoping to lean on strained alliances while fending off questions about whether he sought foreign help to damage a political rival.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5293568.1569216310!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1170178411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
