-\n\nNo verbal instructions will be heard during the tightly choreographed ceremony, with only the sounds of drums and gongs signalling when movement will occur.\n\nImperial ceremonies feature rarely seen outfits and regalia\n\nWith the royals installed in their thrones, a drumbeat will give the signal for attendees, including envoys from more than 190 countries, to rise.\n\nThe emperor, also standing, will then make the official proclamation, likely to be along the lines of the declaration his father decades earlier: \"I proclaim my enthronement to those at home and abroad.\"\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe will then shout \"banzai\" (\"long live the Emperor\") three times, raising his hands in salute with each exclamation.\n\nGuests are expected to join the cheers but foreign invitees are not obliged, according to a government official.\n\nThe former emperor and empress will not be in the crowd, and nor will Naruhito and Masako's only child 17-year-old Princess Aiko, because she is a minor.\n\n- Parade cancelled -\n\nThe ceremony had been due to continue with an open-top car parade before the public, with the royal couple donning formal Western clothes, including a gown and tiara for the empress.\n\nA public parade by the Japanese royal couple has been postponed after a devastating typhoon hit the country\n\nBut in light of the devastation caused by Typhoon Hagibis, which killed nearly 80 people, the Japanese government has postponed the parade until November 10.\n\nA series of banquets, starting from the evening of the proclamation, will still go ahead at the palace.\n\nThe final part of the imperial rites will come in November, when the emperor participates in the Daijosai thanksgiving ceremony.\n\nAgain dressed in traditional robes, he will offer newly harvested rice to the imperial ancestors \"and the deities of heaven and earth\", thanking them for a bountiful harvest and for peace.\n\nThe final imperial rite will take place in November, when the emperor will give thanks for the harvest\n\nThe rice was planted earlier in the year after palace courtiers selected sites using an ancient ritual involving the shells of rare green sea turtles.\n\nTwo thin plates made from turtle shells were heated over a flame to produce cracks, which \"told\" officials to grow the rice in the ancient capital of Kyoto and north of Tokyo in Tochigi prefecture.\n\nThe thanksgiving ritual will be performed on November 14-15, with the main portion taking place overnight in a specially built hall where the emperor will eat the royal rice.", "description": "The ceremony proclaiming the enthronement of Japan's Emperor Naruhito will be a tightly choreographed and solemn affair, steeped in tradition, that cements...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/05/wire-19870390-1571374374-944_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
