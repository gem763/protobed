If antibiotics continue to lose their sting, resistant infections will sap $100 trillion from the world economy between now and 2050, equivalent to $10,000 for every person alive today. Ten million people will die every year, roughly one every three seconds, and more than currently die from cancer. These are conservative estimates: They don\u2019t account for procedures that are only safe or possible because of antibiotics, like hip and joint replacements, gut surgeries, C-sections, cancer chemotherapy, and organ transplants.\n\nAnd yet, resistance is not futile. O\u2019Neill\u2019s report includes ten steps to avert the crisis. Notably, only two address the problem of supply\u2014the lack of new antibiotics. \u201cWhen I first agreed to do this, the advisors presented it to me as a challenge of getting new drugs,\u201d says O\u2019Neill. \u201cBut it dawned on me very quickly that there were just as many, if not more, important issues on the demand side.\u201d Indeed, seven of his recommendations focus on reducing the wanton and wasteful use of our existing arsenal. It\u2019s inevitable that microbes will evolve resistance, but we can delay that process by using drugs more sparingly.\n\nThe first step is to improve sanitation. Fewer infections means less need for antibiotics. For richer nations, the focus lies in reducing infections in hospital settings. For poorer countries, ensuring clean water and better sanitation is paramount; as O\u2019Neill writes, resistance \u201cis intrinsically an issue of economic development.\u201d In India, Nigeria, Indonesia, and Brazil alone, sanitation could save 300 million courses of antibiotics, currently used (often ineffectively) to treat diarrhea.\n\nWe also need a global surveillance network to understand the extent to which antibiotics are being used, the spread of resistant microbes and the genes behind their powers, and the effectiveness of different drug/bug combos. The World Health Organization has already planted the seeds of such a network, and following an earlier O\u2019Neill report, the UK government launched the \u00a3195 million Fleming Fund to build surveillance in poorer countries.\n\nEven without such data, some remedial steps are already obvious. In the U.S. alone, 70 percent of antibiotics that are medically useful to humans are given to animals instead, and not just for treating disease but for promoting growth or compensating for poor farming practices. So O\u2019Neill\u2019s report recommends that from 2018, countries should set ten-year reduction targets to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in agriculture. It also argues for restrictions or bans on the agricultural use of any drug that\u2019s a last-line defense for humans. And it suggests that meat should be transparently labeled so consumers can make informed choices.\n\nA lot of human antibiotic use is wasteful too. Of the 40 million people who get antibiotics in the U.S. every year, only 13 million actually need them; the rest have viral infections that can\u2019t be treated with these drugs. One solution is to develop better, faster, cheaper diagnostic tools, so doctors don\u2019t have to assess vague symptoms, or rely on slow, expensive tests based on centuries-old technology. \u201cI sometimes think that if there was a single most important thing here it might be diagnostics,\u201d says O\u2019Neill.", "description": "A new report estimates that by 2050, drug-resistant infections will kill one person every three seconds, unless the world\u2019s governments take drastic steps now.", "authors": ["Ed Yong"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/05/select_40/facebook.jpg?1522793992", "published_at": "2016-05-19"}
