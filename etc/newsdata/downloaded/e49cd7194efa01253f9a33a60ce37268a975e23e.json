Currently, Patriots tight end Ben Watson is No. 84. Watson appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Monday and addressed whether he would give up the number for Brown.\n\nANTONIO BROWN USED SOCIAL MEDIA CONSULTANTS TO ACCELERATE RELEASE FROM RAIDERS, REPORT SAYS\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been asked that a lot,\u201d Watson told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade. \u201cThe reason why I took 84 \u2026 I\u2019ve been an 82 since I left New England \u2026 And the reason why I took 84 back was because it was the number I was drafted in, the number I had when I was with the Patriots before, the number I felt like I would finish the circle in.\n\n\u201cBut with that being said Mr. Kraft, the owner, owns all the numbers and I was told very early on in my career by a very wise veteran that we\u2019re all renting those lockers and so it\u2019s not my decision about the numbers. So we\u2019ll see what happens with the numbers.\u201d\n\nWatson said he would \u201clove to keep\u201d the number but the decision to give it up wasn\u2019t going to be his to make.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWatson wore the No. 84 for six seasons while he was with the Patriots. He wore the No. 82 for three other teams. Watson is currently listed as No. 84 for the Patriots but he is suspended for the first four games of the season.", "description": "The New England Patriots signed wide receiver Antonio Brown after he was cut by the Oakland Raiders on Saturday prior to the official start of the 2019 regular season.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
