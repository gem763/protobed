To fix it they took off the tiles and put wood underneath to make it straight.\n\nThe couple complained that the roof on the property had not been completed to standard\n\n'Under the window it was meant to be a pattern but it was wonky - my two-year-old could build better than that.'\n\nThey claim Mr Williams said all costs incurred associated with the house would be refunded to the husband and wife.\n\nBut Mrs Chan said when she sent the bills to Bellway - including solicitor and evaluation fees - Bellway replied that it refunded the couple for the full reservation and 'additions' to the property only.\n\nThe firm said it would not refund the family for any other fees.\n\nIn an email, Bellway wrote: 'We are advised that a refund for any other fees in relation to your purchase was not agreed during your discussions at these offices with our Managing Director.'\n\nMrs Chan added: 'We sent all our bills to them and then they wrote back and said that the discussion never happened.\n\n'We would only be given the money back we directly gave to them, however when we spoke to him he said he would refund any costs which have incurred to with the house including the solicitor fees.\n\n'We are now \u00a31,000 out of pocket, we have two young children under two and it took it a long time to get that money together.\n\n'Me and my husband had nothing new the whole time and we had cheap cars to save money.'\n\nThe Chan family are now having to live in a property owned by Mrs Chan's parents - they said if they didn't have this the would be homeless.\n\nTheir nightmare comes after another couple, Emma Moffatt and Jordan Burns, revealed they had also had their reservation for a Bellway home cancelled after complaining about faults.\n\nMrs Chan added: 'We're living in my mum and dad's property, which they were about to sell - so now they're out of pocket too.\n\n'If it wasn't for this property would be homeless.'\n\nMrs Chan claims that shortly after being told their reservation was cancelled, their property was once again being advertised on Rightmove.\n\nThe family said they now have to wait until May to move into a new property they reserved and have filed a county court claim.\n\nA spokesperson for Bellway Homes said: 'As an NHBC five star accredited housebuilder, we are incredibly proud of our customer service and feel that it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment on individual customer cases which remain a private matter between ourselves and our customers.'", "description": "Sarah Chan, 27, and her husband, Jon, 36, were set to move into their new-build home in Huyton, Merseyside, with their two young children in September.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/19481580-0-image-a-13_1570610115483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
