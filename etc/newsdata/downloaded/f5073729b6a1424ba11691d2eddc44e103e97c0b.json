The iPhone 11 will start at $699, which is lowered than what its predecessor, the iPhone XR, cost prior to the announcement. Apple plans to keep the XR around for another year, lowering the price of that device to $599 in a bid to make its offerings a bit more affordable. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, which both feature triple-lens cameras, begin at $999 and $1099, respectively.\n\nApple is planning a Sept. 19 launch for its Arcade gaming service, which will cost $4.99 a month for family access. Apple TV+, the company\u2019s streaming video service, will have the same price tag when it rolls out on Nov. 1. Those who buy a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, or iPod Touch get a year of the TV+ service for free.\n\nThe low price tag of Apple TV+ put pressure on shares of Roku Inc. ROKU, -10.49%, which are off more than 12% in Tuesday trading, as well as shares of Walt Disney Co. DIS, -2.19% and Netflix Inc. NFLX, -2.16%, which are also trading lower.\n\nMarketWatch\u2019s live-blog coverage of the annual Apple event follows below, and we\u2019ll be continuing our analysis of the latest announcements as the day progresses.", "description": "Apple Inc. highlighted the powerful cameras on its new lineup of iPhones on Tuesday, while revealing pricing and launch information for its streaming video...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
