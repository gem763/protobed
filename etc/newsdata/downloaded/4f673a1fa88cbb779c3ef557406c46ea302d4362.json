My mother didn\u2019t have to read the air-quality reports; she knew everything she needed to know based on how labored his breathing was or the intensity of his skin irritation. Pollution drove us out of the city and eventually out of the country. When we arrived in the United States, I saw the sky unfiltered by smog for the first time and realized that the sky was actually supposed to be blue. My family left Iran in pursuit of freedom and clear skies, and now, devastatingly, environmental protections are being dismantled in the United States, the country I love and proudly call home.", "description": "We face big challenges, but we\u2019re not demoralized", "authors": ["Saya Ameli Hajebi", "Gina Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/B-O_KQr_xh0rtEMdmezNT143mN0=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VAHNYZGJJBHH3CUZR5NZC4TYWQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
