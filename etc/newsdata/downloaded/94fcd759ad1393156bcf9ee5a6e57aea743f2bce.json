After all, grandmas seem to have everything they need and don\u2019t ask for much in return for your love. However, surprising your grandma (or nana, nonna, mom-mom\u2014whichever name you affectionately refer to her as) can bring a smile to her face.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the hunt for a thoughtful gift that your grandma will love, you\u2019ve come to the right spot. Here are the 20 best gifts to give your grandma for the holidays.\n\n1. For the grandma who loves to be comfortable: The Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Lite Circle Cardigan\n\nBest gifts for grandma 2019: Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Lite Circle Cardigan. (Photo: Nordstrom)\n\nGrandma probably already owns plenty of coats and jackets, but she might not have a sweater quite as soft as Barefoot Dream's CozyChic Lite Circle Cardigan. The soft, lightweight shrug is a Nordstrom customer favorite, with a nearly 5-star rating from 3,000 reviews. Made from a combination of nylon and rayon, the cardigan is available in sizes 2-16. But, this cardigan runs a little on the large side, so if grandma is in between sizes, order one size down for a cozy fit.\n\nGet the Barefoot Dreams CozyChic Lite Circle Cardigan from Nordstrom for $116\n\n2. For the grandma who likes to easy cooking: The Instant Pot Ultra\n\nBest gifts for grandma 2019: Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart) (Photo: Reviewed / Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nChances are your grandma probably has a lot of family recipes she likes to make for holidays and gatherings. However, she'll appreciate the simplicity of an Instant Pot, which allows her to make meals without dirtying multiple dishes. Our favorite pressure cooker and multi-cooker is the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart). Grandma can choose from one of the 16 pre-programmed recipes ranging from soups to saut\u00e9 to cake. Or, she choose her own time and cooking setting.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 (6 Quart) on Amazon for $108.95\n\n3.

The Google Nest Hub Max can be used to make calls using Google Duo, a video chat app available for iOS and Android devices. Even better? The smart display's 6.5-megapixel auto zooms and pans to keep Nana in view if she's moving around during the call.\n\nAnd, since the Google Nest Hub Max comes with Google Assistant built-in, Nana can ask Google questions about the weather, latest headlines, and more.
