I do not see a majority for a second referendum. This leaves an election.\n\nFrom the EU\u2019s point of view, this is a fairly straightforward decision, unlikely to prove controversial. Since Mr Johnson also wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit \u2014 despite what he says publicly \u2014 their interests are more aligned than it appears.\n\nWhat is the reason behind the shift in Brussels? EU leaders are political animals. They can be quite brutal. Think about how they stitched up Silvio Berlusconi and George Papandreou, the former prime ministers of Italy and Greece during those countries\u2019 crises.\n\nMr Johnson is not in that category. Continental European chancelleries see Mr Johnson as the big beast of British politics right now. They will need him as a political ally beyond Brexit.\n\nWhat has also shifted is their perception of relative risk. The EU would, I think, still prefer Brexit to be reversed. But the past two months have shown that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is much higher than previously thought.\n\nIt is one thing for EU officials to say to a journalist that they expect it, quite another to believe it and to act on it.\n\nGermany may already be in a recession due to a drop in Chinese imports of German manufacturing goods. Brexit uncertainty is also a factor. A no-deal Brexit would turn the industrial recession into something much worse.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel and other EU leaders are willing to accept a less-than-perfect withdrawal agreement to insure against such a calamity. They would rather take the safe option of a compromise than a three-way bet that gives them, say, a 20 per cent probability of both a Brexit reversal and a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat view has changed since the spring, when several EU leaders were only too happy to play the extension game. Even Donald Tusk, the outgoing president of the European Council, has dropped his previous habit of arguing in favour of a second referendum.\n\nI have often disagreed with him, but I thought he hit the right note last week when he spoke about his sadness about Brexit, and his hope that a future generation might reverse the decision.\n\nMany UK Remainers have been in campaigning mode since 2016. They are not ready yet to concede defeat. But at least Mr Tusk has decided that it is time to move on to the next stage of mourning, from denial to acceptance.\n\nThere are other, more subtle, reasons why the EU might want to cut its losses. Brexit has distracted the bloc from other important, unresolved issues.\n\nSome EU leaders had hoped to present the accession of North Macedonia and Albania as antidote to Brexit. One country leaves, two join. France vetoed this, arguing the EU needs to reform itself before the next round of enlargement.\n\nThe EU is also struggling to agree a response to Turkey\u2019s invasion of northern Syria. Germany\u2019s recent decision to allow Chinese group Huawei to participate in its 5G networks shows that the EU has yet to formulate a coherent policy towards China.\n\nAnd the European parliament\u2019s rejection of France\u2019s pick for the next European Commission, Sylvie Goulard, means that we can no longer take the investiture of incoming president Ursula von der Leyen\u2019s selections for granted. Brexit is not the only game in town.\n\nHaving said all this, there is still one big reason to expect more Brexit extensions: EU leaders habitually kick the proverbial can down the road whenever that is possible. While I would not go as far as to claim that they have dropped this preference, I believe this time is different because interests have shifted. munchau@eurointelligence.com\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "EU leaders habitually kick the proverbial can down the road whenever that is possible.
