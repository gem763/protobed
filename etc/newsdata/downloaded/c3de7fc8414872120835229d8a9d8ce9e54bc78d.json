Lawmakers pointed out that because of this, prosecution for cannabis use or possession may still be possible.\n\nACT Attorney General Gordon Ramsay said Wednesday that the new legislation did not entirely remove the risk of arrests, according to Australia's public broadcaster the ABC.\n\n\"Unfortunately (this law) cannot stop someone being arrested and charged if the Commonwealth officials were minded to do so, or prosecuted if the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions thought it were appropriate to do so,\" he reportedly told lawmakers.", "description": "Australian lawmakers have voted to legalize marijuana in the country's capital city Canberra and its surrounding jurisdiction.", "authors": ["Chloe Taylor"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106136369-1568818197857rtx73btr.jpg?v=1568818297", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
