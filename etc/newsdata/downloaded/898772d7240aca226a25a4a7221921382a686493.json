The higher the classification on a piece of information, the fewer people in government who can access it. Goitein, who directs the national-security program at the Brennan Center, called this \u201ca time-honored technique of keeping other agencies or other officials out of something in order to minimize resistance.\u201d She noted the CIA\u2019s use of torture in the wake of the September 11 attacks as one example. The program of waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques was put in place by a relatively small group of the agency\u2019s members, and was shielded from adequate scrutiny, in part because it was so highly classified. \u201cAnyone who would have objected,\u201d Goitein said, \u201cwas excluded.\u201d\n\nRead: Revenge of the intelligence nerds\n\nFew argue that classification is entirely unnecessary. The cables released by Manning, which were published by WikiLeaks, are themselves a testament to the need for certain information to be protected. They contained candid discussions about foreign leaders. They also had the names of foreign civilians who\u2019d met with U.S. officials in sensitive countries and details of their conversations, which put lives at risk.\n\nYet when so much information among the vast U.S. national-security apparatus is classified without good reason, it exacerbates a culture of secrecy that is vulnerable to abuse. There is little oversight, Goitein said, when it comes to determining whether a decision to classify something was the right one\u2014while decisions not to classify something can lead to heavy penalties. Most cases of overclassification are the result of simple habit, convenience, or an overabundance of caution, but this helps to create a climate that enables the use of excessive secrecy to hide things that are politically problematic or to cover up wrongdoing. That\u2019s allegedly what happened with the July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which put Trump on the path to an impeachment inquiry. \u201cThe system is set up to fail,\u201d Goitein told me. \u201cIt\u2019s based on skewed incentives and lax accountability, and that\u2019s why abuses like this become possible.\u201d\n\nRead: What happened in Ukraine?\n\nDuring the call, according to a reconstructed transcript later released by the White House, Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate discredited allegations surrounding Joe Biden and his elder son\u2019s work in Ukraine. This came as Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid. According to the whistle-blower complaint that brought the contents of the call to light, about a dozen U.S. officials were listening in on the phone conversation. (On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed reports that he was one of them.) But the call took place behind a wall of government secrecy. The notes and transcripts from it, as is common practice with calls between the president and foreign leaders, were classified. Then, according to the complaint, White House officials, allegedly wise to the troubling nature of Trump\u2019s remarks, moved the record of the call to a special computer system typically reserved for military and intelligence matters so sensitive that they require a code word, to prevent it from leaking.", "description": "American officials classify too much information, from the trivial to the politically inconvenient.
