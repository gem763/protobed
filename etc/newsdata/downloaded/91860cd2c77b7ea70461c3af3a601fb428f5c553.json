Sathya Narayanan\n\nSept 13 (Reuters) - Gold prices rose back above the key\n\n$1,500 level on Friday as the U.S. dollar slipped on the back of\n\na strong euro, though hopes for a thaw in Sino-U.S. trade\n\ntensions supported equity markets, capping bullion's gains.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.5% to $1,506.61 per ounce as of 0951\n\nGMT, but was marginally down for the week.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 rose 0.5% to $1,514.30 per ounce.\n\n\"The main reason is that the dollar is lower. Market focus\n\nis now on the Federal Reserve meeting and retail sales data,\n\nwhich is due today,\" ABN Amro analyst Georgette Boele said.\n\nThe U.S. dollar slipped from an over one-week high\n\nscaled in the previous session as the euro surged on rising\n\nGerman bond yields as investors bet the European Central Bank\n\nwas done cutting interest rates. USD/ Investors are now awaiting the U.S. central bank meeting\n\nnext week where it is expected to slash its benchmark interest\n\nrate by at least 25 basis points for the second consecutive\n\ntime. FEDWATCH\n\nMarkets are also keeping a close watch on any economic data\n\nfrom the United States to gauge the economy's strength ahead of\n\nthe monetary policy meeting. The U.S. retail sales report is due\n\nat 1230 GMT on Friday.\n\nAnalysts said that fears of a deceleration in global\n\neconomic growth and a plethora of negative-yielding government\n\ndebt around the world, along with dovish monetary policy outlook\n\nby global central banks will be supporting bullion longer term.\n\n\"(Gold) is still in a lateral trading range. We are seeing a\n\ntechnical rebound from the $1,500 level. The support level of\n\n$1,500 is quite strong and is holding prices up,\" ActivTrades\n\nchief analyst Carlo Alberto De Casa said.\n\nHowever, bullion's upside was limited as global equities\n\nclimbed to a six-week high on signs of progress in U.S.-China\n\ntrade talks.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he preferred a complete\n\ntrade deal with China but did not rule out the likelihood of an\n\ninterim pact, even as he said an \"easy\" agreement wouldn't be\n\npossible, ahead of scheduled talks next month.\n\nElesewhere, palladium XPD= fell 0.7% to $1,606.56 per\n\nounce, after hitting an all-time high of $1,621.55 on Thursday\n\nas possible labour issues in South African mines stoked supply\n\nconcerns in an already tight market. The auto-catalyst metal, however, was up over 4% so far this\n\nweek and was on track for a sixth straight weekly gain.\n\nSilver rose 0.4% to $18.16 per ounce, while platinum\n\nXPT= inched 0.5% higher to $955.76.
