Instead, he has delivered a bill that would allow debt to continue to accrue and repayment to be put off indefinitely.\n\nThe city is as exposed to bankruptcy as ever, as Turner\u2019s plan primarily deals with what checks get written when, not with the massive debt that continues to mount.\n\nState Sen. Joan Huffman filed a bill last week containing Turner\u2019s plan, with one addition opposed by both Turner and the Houston unions: a requirement that the city get voter approval before issuing $1 billion in pension obligation bonds.\n\nThe bill cleared a Senate committee Monday on a 7-1 vote, as did a stand-alone bill by state Sen. Paul Bettencourt that would also require public approval for pension bonds. In the House, the Pensions Committee cancelled a hearing.\n\nTo put the city\u2019s pension debt into household terms, Houston has been refinancing its teaser-rate mortgage every year or two, getting further and further underwater.\n\nTurner promised an end to that with the equivalent of a fixed 30-year mortgage. He delivered, but there\u2019s a catch: Houston can take out second mortgages, third mortgages, and so on in perpetuity, each with a new 30-year repayment period.\n\nAnd Turner would like to kick off this journey to solvency by putting his next house payment of $134 million on the credit card, so to speak.\n\nThe upside of the plan is that Turner has won some concessions. The police and municipal employees unions are willing to trade some of their IOUs (payable by taxpayers) for cash up front at a steep discount. The firefighters union has decided to oppose the plan, but Huffman said Monday that they \u201cwill have to be brought along kicking and screaming.\u201d\n\nThe city would issue bonds to infuse the funds with $1 billion in cash, while the unions would give up $2.5 billion in promised benefits.\n\nThe firefighters have an incredibly sweet deal already, no requirement to negotiate with the city, and tremendous political power with Democrats and Republicans. If Houston is going to avoid bankrupting itself, the firefighters\u2019 grip on power will have to be loosened, so a fractured coalition here counts as a win for taxpayers, regardless of what happens to the bill.\n\nThe firefighters have opposed reform at every turn, refusing even to open their books to lawmakers or city officials. Their arguments Monday amounted to \u201ca promise is a promise\u201d and \u201chere are some widows.\u201d\n\nActually, the voters of Houston have promised the union little. The state began dictating pension terms to Houston in 1947.\n\nOn the rare occasion that voters have been consulted, as they were in 2004, they declined to guarantee public pensions while supporting the idea of collective bargaining. The fire union has found it much more profitable to manipulate state lawmakers into giving them what they want than to negotiate with the city.\n\nWhile Turner\u2019s bill achieves some concessions, it doesn\u2019t deliver the promised features.\n\n\u201cWe cap the city\u2019s exposure,\u201d Turner told the committee. \u201cThe bill says that the parties are obligated to come back to the table and they shall adjust their benefits to stay within the corridor,\u201d which is a separate cap limiting the city\u2019s pension payments to 37 percent of payroll.\n\nBut the cap can be punctured, if the city and the pension boards want to resume kicking the can down the road, through a new concept called a \u201cliability loss layer.\u201d\n\nSkipping the details of how it would be activated, the concept would allow for losses from investment underperformance to be amortized over new 30-year periods. This is important, as the unfunded liability has been created in large part by poor planning.\n\nWhen the pension funds pretend they\u2019ll get 8.2 percent returns, and their actual returns last year were negative 1.5 percent, a brand-new billion-dollar liability shows up on the books.\n\nEven though the pension funds will use a 7 percent projected rate of return going forward, massive new debts will show up every year that those returns fail to materialize.\n\nTurner\u2019s plan calls for the workers to make up some of those shortfalls through higher payroll contribution rates, but it doesn\u2019t enforce it, and it leaves the escape valve of the \u201cliability loss layer.\u201d\n\nHis plan shifts some exposure to retirees through mandatory cuts in cost-of-living allowances when the market does poorly.\n\nBill King, Turner\u2019s Republican rival in the last election, noted on his blog that the debt far outweighs the workers\u2019 ability to cover losses through their paychecks:\n\n\u201cBecause the liability is so large relative to the payroll (total pension liability is approximately 15 times payroll), it will take large increases in employee contributions to make up even modest misses on the investment performance. The employee contribution levels in the new agreement are about 10 percent. So, a consistent 1 percent miss on the investment goal of 7 percent would eventually require the employee contribution to go to 18 percent. At contributions anywhere in that kind of range, the City will not be able to recruit or retain employees.\u201d\n\nTurner said Monday that if he\u2019s not able to use a pension bond to cover a $134 million pension contribution that\u2019s due, then \u201ca lot of people will not be working.\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s what got Houston into its present mess: the unwillingness of its leaders to pay the pension contributions due every year. For 17 years, they\u2019ve been financing it through debt.\n\nHouston isn\u2019t even paying all of the interest due on its pension debt, much less paying down the principal. Turner\u2019s plan would continue that \u201cnegative amortization\u201d by another 8 to 10 years, by King\u2019s estimate, before the payments began to escalate sharply.\n\nJames Quintero of the Texas Public Policy Foundation summed up the strengths and shortcomings of the plan.\n\nHe praised the \u201cadjustments to the DROP program,\u201d notorious for its million-dollar payouts, as well as the fixed 30-year schedule, and Huffman\u2019s inclusion of a provision to allow voters to decide on the pension bonds.\n\nHe pointed out that the plan lacks a 401k-like \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plan for new hires. That\u2019s one of the easy first steps that struggling localities elsewhere have taken, but which Turner rejects for ideological reasons.\n\nHouston should also have local control of its own money, he said, also arguing that the 7 percent discount rate was unrealistic.\n\nKing and most local conservatives have also argued for a defined contribution plan.\n\nA few experts have noticed that Turner\u2019s plan, if tweaked, could be used to impose a defined contribution plan through the back door. That is, in setting a defined maximum the city will pay each year, the city could be defining its contribution. But the liability loss layers would have to be stripped from the plan.\n\nSo long as the taxpayers are responsible for covering debts worth more than everything the city owns, there is no limit to the danger.\n\nJon Cassidy reports for the Texas Bureau of Watchdog.org Contact him at jon@watchdog.org and follow him on Twitter @jpcassidy000.", "description": "Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner has proposed a pension reform plan .09/02/2019 3:21:10AM EST.", "authors": ["Jon Cassidy", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/sylvester-turner-300x225.jpg"}
