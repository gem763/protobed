When he was still a senator-elect, in December 1972, his immediate family was in a car accident. His first wife and infant daughter were killed, while his two sons, Beau and Hunter, survived. Going forward, Biden began the practice of commuting on Amtrak from Delaware to Washington, DC every day so he could return home to his children.\n\nAs an adult, Hunter Biden has been the black sheep of the Biden clan. He has suffered from alcoholism for several decades, and he has used both cocaine and crack recreationally. In 2013 Hunter was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve, in a ceremony administered by his father. A month later, he was given an \u201cadministrative discharge\u201d after testing positive for cocaine. Hunter claims his consumption of the drug at the time was accidental.\n\nDespite multiple attempts at rehabilitation and abstention, it was not enough to save his marriage. In 2015, Hunter separated from his wife of twenty-two years, Kathleen Buhle. In the subsequent divorce proceedings, Kathleen claimed Hunter had left the family (including their three children) in financial ruin through his extravagant spending on alcohol, drugs, prostitutes, strip clubs, and multiple affairs. Hunter denies the prostitution accusation but admitted to going to a strip club immediately after the legal motion was filed. He claims it was his first time doing so in years. Their divorce was finalized in 2017.\n\nAs previously covered at the National Interest, Hunter Biden assumed a position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company called Burisma Holdings in April 2014. This was two months after a U.S.-backed uprising against the previous Ukrainian government, an action U.S. officials at the time said was \u201cmidwifed\u201d by his father, who at the time was vice president.\n\nA former Obama State Department official, speaking to the National Interest, said \u201cUkraine was looked on in 2014, prior to the crisis with Russia, as a sort of policy backwater. There was very little high-level attention.\u201d Speculating on why Joe Biden was given the Ukraine portfolio instead of other members of the administration, the former official gave multiple possibilities, including an adversarial relationship between National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and ideological disposition. While President Barack Obama was more hard-nosed on Ukraine, \u201cBiden I think had something more of a liberal-internationalist approach to Ukraine, where he understood it could be an important part of the European order.\u201d\n\nHunter Biden served on Burisma\u2019s board from 2014 to April 2019, a five-year period where he was paid $50,000 a month. While never traveling to Ukraine himself, he regularly attended the company\u2019s twice-annual board meetings, while providing legal and strategic advice. Prior to Burisma, Hunter Biden worked in the Clinton administration Commerce Department, where he focused on e-commerce issues; on the board of Amtrak under President George W. Bush; and in 2013 co-founded BHR Partners, a firm focusing on Chinese capital investment. He had no previous experience with either Ukraine or the energy field.\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News, when asked if he would have been given the position at Burisma without the last name Biden, Hunter said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not.\u201d He maintains that he does not regret taking the job.\n\nIn conversation with the National Interest, the former Obama State Department official said that during his time in the administration he never heard Hunter Biden\u2019s name mentioned in conjunction with Ukraine, nor was he familiar with the firm Burisma Holdings. Deputy Secretary of State George Kent, testifying behind closed doors last week, apparently stated that he tried to address concerns over Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with the vice president\u2019s office in 2016 but was rebuffed by Biden staff.\n\nBiden per is unwavering in support of Biden fils. \u201cMy son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong . . . My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself,\u201d Joe Biden said during last week\u2019s Democratic primary debate, referring to the ABC interview which aired hours earlier. \u201cMy son made a judgment, I\u2019m proud of the judgment he made, I\u2019m proud of what he had to say.\u201d\n\nBoth Bidens assert that they never discussed Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine, beyond a comment in late 2015 when the elder Biden said, \u201cI hope you know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and his son responded, \u201cI do.\u201d Did he?\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s eldest son, Beau, served as Attorney General of Delaware from 2007 to 2015 and had the intention of running for governor in 2016. He had joined the Delaware National Guard in 2003, and from 2008\u20132009 was stationed at Camp Victory in Iraq. Camp Victory made use of a large burn pit, where waste (including paints, plastics, tires, and Styrofoam) was burned in the open air. Doctors now connect the use of these burn pits and the carcinogens they released to heightened rates of cancer among veterans. Beau Biden died prematurely of brain cancer in 2015. As a Senator, his father voted in favor of the Iraq War in 2002.\n\nA year after Beau\u2019s death, Hunter Biden (while still legally married) began a romantic relationship with his brother\u2019s widowed wife Hallie, whom he said shared his grief. When news of the relationship broke, Joe Biden said in a statement to the New York Post, \u201cWe are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. . . . They have mine and Jill\u2019s full and complete support and we are happy for them.\u201d They broke up early this year.\n\nIn May 2019, Hunter Biden married a South African filmmaker named Melissa Cohen. They had met each other a week before the ceremony. The couple currently lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNow Hunter and, by extension, his father\u2019s third run for the presidency, have become enmeshed in controversy as Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Hunter\u2019s questionable business dealings in the war-torn country are coming under attack from congressional Democrats. The impeachment inquiry has focused on Trump. It would be a pity, however, if it obscured the miasma of sleaze surrounding Hunter Biden, particularly as his father tries to run as someone who exemplifies old-fashioned \u201cmiddle-class\u201d values.\n\nHunter DeRensis is a reporter at the National Interest.\n\nImage: Reuters", "description": "Hunter Biden and, by extension, his father\u2019s third run for the presidency, have become enmeshed in controversy as Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Hunter\u2019s questionable business dealings in the war-torn country are coming under attack from congressional Democrats.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://nationalinterest.org/sites/default/files/main_images/RTS2RPZD.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
