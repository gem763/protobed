The 2021 Colorado benefits from a few appearance tweaks meant to differentiate the off-road-oriented ZR2 and Z71 trim levels from the rest of the lineup.\n\nAll 2021 Colorado models from the basic Work Truck (WT) trim level up to the intense ZR2 off-roader get a revised front fascia and an embossed \"Chevrolet\" logo on the tailgate to replace the traditional Chevy bowtie. The WT and LT models also get a different design for the gold bowtie on the grille, and the Z71 gets a black bowtie badge up front. The ZR2 and Z71 get an attractive new Sand Dune metallic paint color, seen here, and the ZR2 now comes standard with red tow hooks.\n\nPhoto credit: Chevrolet More\n\nThese appearance changes round out the updates, as there aren't any mechanical differences for the 2021 model. Chevy hasn't yet released pricing yet, but says it will come in due time before the trucks go on sale sometime next year.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "All Colorados get different badging and a tweaked front end, and the ZR2 and Z71 off-road models benefit from a new color.", "authors": ["Joey Capparella"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Mm_BB2rF7GM9Q30zBzdX9A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/5b49cbf9ffb77e08d7aa8b87130e0436", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
