They want their obituary writer back. If only this same newspaper would worry as much about writing fair and balanced headlines about President Donald Trump. Or conservatives. Right?\n\nThe obituary in The Post was actually written by Joby Warrick, national security reporter. Meaning: Warrick should know better. Meaning: If Warrick covers national security, then America\u2019s readers are in trouble.\n\nThe headline \u2014 before a red-faced Washington Post removed it \u2014 read: \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48.\u201d\n\nThat raises all kinds of interesting questions, foremost, perhaps, this: How left of left does one have to be to actually paint ISIS is a good light?\n\nThe obituary went on to showcase the rise of al-Baghdadi\u2019s power from a shadow leader within ISIS \u2014 from a humble \u201creligious scholar with wireframe glasses\u201d \u2014 to madcap murderer. Of course, The Post didn\u2019t really showcase the madcap murderer part; it was left as implied.\n\nUltimately, the headline was changed to \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s barely the American view, either.\n\nBetter would\u2019ve been, \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS terror chief, dies in U.S. operation.\u201d Or, \u201cAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS leader, \u2018died like a dog\u2019: Trump.\u201d\n\nThat second especially would\u2019ve segued nicely into how the founder of one of the world\u2019s most vicious terror organizations, the guy who eluded capture for years, ultimately killed himself as U.S. forces closed in \u2014 a successful U.S. operation that resulted in zero U.S. casualties. Go America.\n\nGo U.S. forces.\n\nYay, White House.\n\nInstead, we get Sorry, ISIS.\n\n\u201cRegarding our al-Baghdadi obituary,\u201d said Washington Post spokesperson Kristine Coratti Kelly to Fox News, \u201cthe headline should never have read that way and changed it quickly.\u201d\n\nRight. But not before the damage was done.\n\nNot before the country saw The Post in all its ridiculously ridiculous ISIS-defending mode. Not before the world, including ISIS terrorists, saw The Post, a fixture of American media, give the bad guys an easy propaganda win.\n\nIf al-Baghdadi was an \u201caustere religious scholar,\u201d then Richard the \u201cNight Stalker\u201d Ramirez was a vigilant neighborhood watch guard. Ridiculously ridiculous. The left can\u2019t get any more ridiculous than trying to be fair and balanced to a murderous terrorist piece of scum.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
