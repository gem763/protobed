His full name cannot be published under German privacy laws.\n\nSchuster said that while it was normal practice in his experience for all synagogues to have police guards while services were being conducted inside, this appeared not to be the case in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, where Halle is located.\n\nHowever, the head of Germany\u2019s police union was skeptical about the feasibility of providing that level of protection.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have to guard every synagogue, every church, every mosque, every holy place in Germany around the clock, so I don\u2019t know if this was a mistake or if this really couldn\u2019t have been foreseen,\u201d Oliver Malchow told public television.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nIn the event, the synagogue\u2019s solid locked gates and high walls provided ample protection against the attacker\u2019s seemingly improvised weapons.\n\nMalchow also defended police in Halle who took 15 minutes to reach the synagogue, saying they could only respond after receiving reports about the incident, and that armored units often had to come from greater distances.\n\n\u201cThis shows how thin the level of police coverage is,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is holding back ... it probably wasn\u2019t possible to be quicker.\u201d", "description": "A prominent Jewish community leader accused German authorities on Thursday of providing inadequate security at a synagogue that was attacked by a far-right gunman as dozens prayed inside.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439176547&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990IM", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
