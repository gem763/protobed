A total of 39 people were on board the Conception, and as of late Monday, there were 25 confirmed deaths, The Associated Press said, citing Coast Guard reports.\n\nThe desperation became clear to Bob Hansen when he stepped outside his cabin and saw the glow of the raging fire in the dark. In an interview, he said that he had seen the Conception completely engulfed in flames, \u201cfrom stem to stern\u201d.\n\n\u201cI could see the fire coming through holes on the side of the boat,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were these explosions every few beats. You can\u2019t prepare yourself for that. It was horrendous.\u201d\n\nIn a haunting distress call apparently made from the Conception and recorded by a Ventura County marine radio channel, a man yells, \u201cMayday! Mayday! Mayday!\u201d Through the distortion and crackle of the radio call, the man\u2019s fear is apparent. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d he screams.\n\nRescue crews scoured the waters south of Santa Barbara and west of Los Angeles throughout the day Monday, hoping that they might find survivors from the Conception, which had been on a three-day holiday excursion to the Channel Islands, part of a national park encompassing rugged, pristine coves in the Pacific.\n\nThe remains of four victims were recovered by rescue teams Monday, according to Sheriff Bill Brown of Santa Barbara County, and an additional four had been located \u201con the ocean floor in close proximity to the vessel\u201d, he said. There were six crew members aboard and 33 passengers.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, Coast Guard boats were still conducting search and rescue operations.\n\nA Coast Guard spokeswoman, Monica Rochester, said during a news conference late Monday that the search would continue through the night. But she said the crew members were the only known survivors from the Conception. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tragic event, and we will search all the way through the night, into the morning,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think we should all be prepared to move into the worst outcome.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nTwenty-five dead and nine missing after California diving boat inferno\n\n\n\n\n\nPassengers on the Conception slept in a single room below deck that was tightly packed with bunk beds, according to a floor plan of the boat on the website of Truth Aquatics, the Santa Barbara-based company that operated the vessel. Narrow staircases from the sleeping quarters and showers led to the galley.\n\nIt remains unclear what started the fire. But Mr Brown said that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t have asked for a worse situation\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou have a vessel in the open sea that is in the middle of the night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sleeping compartment was on the bottom deck of the ship. They would have been sound asleep when this fire started.\u201d\n\nIt was too early Monday to say whether negligence had played any role in the fire. \u201cThe vessel has been in full compliance,\u201d Rochester said at a news conference. The boat was equipped with a fire suppression system in the engine room. The vessel also had an onboard, built-in barbecue, according to the website.", "description": "The frantic knocking came well before dawn and jolted Bob and Shirley Hansen awake on their 60ft fishing boat, The Grape Escape, moored for the night off the coast of Southern California.Five men soaking wet and shivering in their underwear told the Hansens of a catastrophic fire that had ravaged their", "authors": ["Niraj Chokshi", "Jose A Del Real", "Thomas Fuller"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6srPC7PO7t.xVOqwfEVmpg--~B/aD0zOTQ7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/c9a6f8c17cbb19f73bfbf7c25e8a0eab"}
