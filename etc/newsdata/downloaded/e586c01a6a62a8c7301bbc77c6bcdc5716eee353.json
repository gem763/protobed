REUTERS/Samsul Said\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest edible oil importer currently imposes a 40% import tax on crude palm oil and 50% on refined palm oils. But since January, shipments of refined palm oils from Malaysia have been taxed at 45%, under an agreement with Malaysia.\n\nThis reduced the effective difference in duty between crude palm oil and refined palm oil from Malaysia for Indian refiners to 5.5% from 11%, making overseas buying of refined palm more lucrative.\n\nThat led to a 727% surge in Malaysia\u2019s refined palm exports to India in the first half of 2019 to 1.57 million tonnes compared with the same period a year before, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.\n\nMumbai-based trade body the Solvent Extractors\u2019 Association of India said rising shipments of refined palm oil hit local refiners and filed an application with the Directorate General of Trade Remedies for an investigation.\n\nThe watchdog last week recommended raising the import tax on refined products.\n\nIndia said the 50% duty on refined products would be applicable until March 2, 2020.\n\nThe hike in duty on refined palm oil will prompt Indian buyers to switch to crude palm oil, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer.\n\n\u201cImporting refined palm oil is no longer attractive. From October imports of CPO could rise and refined palm will go down,\u201d he said.\n\nIndia imports palm oil mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. Indonesia traditionally claimed two-thirds of India\u2019s palm oil imports, but in the first half of 2019 Malaysia surpassed Indonesia as biggest supplier to India due to the duty advantage.\n\n\u201cIndonesia is likely to regain market share again in coming months. It provides crude palm oil more competitively than Malaysia,\u201d said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.\n\nPalm oil accounts for two-thirds of India\u2019s vegetable oil imports. New Delhi also imports soyoil from Argentina and Brazil and sunflower oil from Ukraine and Russia.", "description": "India has raised the tax on refined palm oil from Malaysia to 50% from 45% for six months to curb imports and boost local refining.", "authors": ["Rajendra Jadhav", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426233896&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831T8"}
