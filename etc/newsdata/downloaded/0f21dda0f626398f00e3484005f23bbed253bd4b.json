Ron Johnson for bringing up \u201cFox News conspiracy propaganda stuff\u201d on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday when Johnson failed to directly answer a question about President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nTodd asked Johnson, R-Wis., why he said he winced \u201cat the suggestion\u201d that Trump withheld Ukraine military aid as leverage for an investigation into foreign interference during the 2016 presidential election. When Johnson began to change the topic to claim that the president was \u201cset up\u201d in part by FBI agents, former political opponent Hillary Clinton and Ukrainians, a conspiracy theory circulated by Fox News and conservative media, the Sunday show host quickly interrupted.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why a Fox news conspiracy, propaganda stuff, is popping up on here,\u201d Todd said speaking over Johnson. \u201cI have no idea why we\u2019re going here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause this is underlining exactly what President Trump is upset and why his supporters are upset at the news media,\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cThis is not about the media,\u201d rebutted Todd, who then shouted to get the senator to respond to his original question.\n\n\u201cSenator Johnson, please!\u201d Todd said, holding up his hand. \u201cCan we please answer the question I asked you instead of trying to make Donald Trump feel better here that you\u2019re not criticizing him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to ask you a simple question about what made you wince,\u201d Todd continued, speaking over Johnson. \u201cYou clearly were upset that somehow there was an implication that military aid was being frozen because the president wanted an investigation. Why did you wince?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want those connected, and I was supporting the aid,\u201d Johnson finally answered. \u201cBut here\u2019s the salient point about why I came forward: When I asked the president about that he completely denied it. He adamantly denied it. He vehemently, angrily denied it. He said, \u2018I would never do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the piece of the puzzle I\u2019m here to report today,\u201d Johnson continued, \u201cthat unlike the narrative of the press that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is he wants an accounting of what happened in 2016, who set him up, did things spring from Ukraine?\u201d\n\n\"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd, left, and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019. More\n\nJohnson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, went on to quote an article published by Politico in 2017, reporting that \u201cDonald Trump wasn\u2019t the only presidential candidate whose campaign was boosted by officials of a former Soviet bloc country\u201d and that Ukraine government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee by exposing ties between Russia and Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cThere is potential interference in the 2016 campaign, that\u2019s what Trump wants to get to the bottom of but the press doesn\u2019t want to,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cThe people who wrote this article are being pilloried. I\u2019m being called a conspiracy theorist. [Fox News contributor] John Solomon is being called a conspiracy theorist because the press is horribly biased. And Trump and his supporters completely understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that the way to avoid answering a question is to attack us in the press,\u201d Todd said.\n\nJohnson insisted there be an investigation into the unfounded theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the previous presidential election on behalf of Clinton, including \u201ctrying to keep Vice President Biden out of the primary for the Democratic campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, senator, do you not believe the Russians interfered in the presidential elections to benefit Donald Trump?\u201d asked Todd.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely did,\u201d Johnson answered. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know to what extent the Ukrainians did. I don\u2019t know to what extent the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign were involved in kind of juicing up the Ukrainian involvement as well. There are a lot of unanswered questions.\u201d", "description": "Chuck Todd slammed Republican Sen.
