His fund also took positions in Argentina\u2019s 100-year-bonds, according to a person familiar with Mr. Gibbins\u2019s thinking, who declined to detail the size of the firm\u2019s overall investment.\n\nRobert Gibbins, founder of Autonomy Capital, believes Argentina\u2019s battered markets will recover, according to people familiar with this thinking.

That sent markets tied to Argentina into turmoil because the outcome indicated he may lose re-election next month and see his market overhauls unraveled by leftist rivals.\n\nAutonomy lost 23% last month, people familiar with the numbers said, or roughly $1 billion. Bloomberg and the Financial Times earlier reported that Autonomy lost money during the first half of August.\n\nIt is not known whether Autonomy still holds all of the positions that caused the losses. Mr. Gibbins stands by his investment, according to people familiar with his thinking. He believes Argentina\u2019s battered markets will recover, these people said. In recent weeks, Autonomy has offered its existing clients the ability to add money to the fund, people familiar with the pitch said.\n\n\u201cWhen all is said and done on this trade, I think we will make money,\u201d said a person familiar with Mr. Gibbins\u2019s thinking.\n\nMr. Gibbins, a former Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. trader, founded Autonomy Capital in 2003 and grew it into one of the most prominent hedge funds betting on macroeconomic trends. At the start of August, the company managed around $6 billion. Autonomy until recently had been one of the better performing funds, gaining 17% last year.\n\nOther large investment firms were also hit by the market turmoil in Argentina. One was Franklin Templeton Investments, which has about 2.5% of its $110 billion global macro portfolio invested in the country, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nBig foreign investors aren\u2019t new to Argentina, and sometimes they make out with substantial gains. Billionaire Paul Singer \u2019s Elliott Management Corp. famously spent 15 years on a wager in government bonds. By 2016, that drawn-out bet eventually yielded $2.4 billion, including over $100 million for lawyer fees and other considerations, a gain of roughly 10 to 15 times its original investment, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.\n\nThe latest market upset was sparked by investor concerns about the return to power of the nationalist Peronist movement that is expected to ditch austerity policies Mr. Macri began to put in place in 2015. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the Peronist candidate, is the heavy favorite to win the Oct. 27 election.\n\nEarlier this week, the government implemented capital controls, an unexpected step that comes more than three years after President Macri lifted similar restrictions. His administration already has frozen prices for gasoline and some basic food products to help Argentines. Annual inflation in the country runs at about 55%, one of the world\u2019s highest rates.\n\nThe government instituted the capital controls in a bid to prevent a depletion of foreign-currency reserves amid a crisis of confidence that has fueled dollar outflows. The controls require the central bank to limit dollar sales, forcing companies and banks to obtain authorization to purchase hard currency.\n\nThe capital-control measures were announced after the government last week unilaterally extended the maturity of all short-term paper. That came after the government was unable to roll over obligations resulting from plunging demand for its debt.\n\n\u2014Ryan Dube contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Rachael Levy at rachael.levy@wsj.com", "description": "Hedge fund Autonomy Capital lost about $1 billion last month largely on investments tied to Argentina,\u00a0making it one of the most\u00a0prominent investors caught on the wrong side of market turmoil in that country.", "authors": ["Rachael Levy", "Rachael.Levy Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104051/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
