Now, Dell has an option that\u2019s even easier. The Latitude 7400 2-in-1, a recently introduced business laptop, features a new ExpressSign-in feature that takes Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello facial recognition app one step further: it looks for your face and then automatically signs you in to the system even if it\u2019s in sleep mode.\n\nAside from the trick new login system, the $1,599 ($2,802 as tested) Latitude is a fairly typical small business laptop. The 14-inch FHD (1920 x 1080) display is surrounded by a very narrow bezel, which, surprisingly, still contains enough space for an IR camera with an LED and a proximity sensor. The bezel also allows for well-designed hinges that allow the display to travel the 360-degree arc that makes this a 2-in-1 system. The display is reasonably good \u2014 certainly good enough for most business applications and casual video watching.\n\nThe screen knows you\n\nThe biggest draw is its use of Intel\u2019s Context Sensing technology along with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello facial recognition system. The idea is that the Latitude should recognize your face and start the computer without you having to do anything. You don\u2019t even have to hit the keyboard to wake up the system.\n\nWhen you look directly at the screen, the proximity sensor causes two LEDs on either side of the camera to strobe for a second or two, the screen goes on, and the Windows Hello eye icon on the screen looks back and forth while text tells you that it\u2019s trying to recognize you. It usually takes under five seconds for the system to recognize you and tun on.\n\nOur review of Dell Latitude 7400 2-in-1 Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Compact and solidly built\n\nNifty facial recognition technology\n\nGood battery life\n\nComfortable keyboard Bad Stuff Facial recognition tech can be occasionally glitchy\n\nSharp edge can be irritating when typing Buy for $1,599.00 from Dell\n\nYou can also set how long it will take for the PC to lock and turn off the display; you can time it for one, two, or three minutes.\n\nSomewhat to my surprise, it works \u2014 mostly. When I first set it up (while wearing glasses), I wasn\u2019t all that impressed with the results. The Latitude recognized me about 50 percent of the time, and twice, it couldn\u2019t identify me at all. The second time it couldn\u2019t make the identification, it suggested that I add another recognition session to help. (Just to make things interesting, this time, I went through the setup with my glasses off.)\n\nAfter the second setup, things were much improved. The system quickly started up from sleep mode and signed me in most of the time when I sat in front of it and looked at the screen, whether or not I wore glasses. It wasn\u2019t 100 percent predictable. Occasionally, I would stare directly into the dark screen, and nothing happened until I tapped on the keyboard. In addition, the proximity sensors are only enable when the Latitude is in laptop or \u201cstand\u201d modes, when the camera and sensors are above the display. They don\u2019t work when the screen is in \u201ctent mode\u201d and the camera and sensors are below the screen.\n\nWhen it does work, it\u2019s rather cool. Once, it became a game. I was working at another computer with the Latitude 7400 sitting at the side of my desk, and when I saw it lock down out of the corner of my eye, I\u2019d turn my head to glance at it and watch those two red LEDs flash and the system go live.\n\nIs this something that you absolutely need? Not really. From what I can tell, it\u2019s not hugely different than the Windows Hello systems on other PCs, just slightly more convenient. But it can save you a couple of seconds, and it adds a bit of high-tech fun to the working day.\n\nThe rest of the specs\n\nAt 12.59 x 7.87 x 0.34 inches, the Latitude is a nicely compact machine. In fact, because of its size, the weight of the computer \u2014 just under three pounds \u2014 is a little startling at first, perhaps because it is slightly heavier than many of the lightweight corporate systems that are touted today. This can be at least partly attributed to its 4-cell 78Wh battery, which has a claimed battery life up to 25 hours. While I didn\u2019t do any formal battery tests, the Latitude did last comfortably through an active business day and stayed nicely cool.\n\nThere are enough ports to satisfy most business (and personal) needs. On the right side is an audio jack, SD card reader, optional SIM card slot, and a USB 3.1 port. The left side includes two Thunderbolt ports, an HDMI port, and a second USB 3.1 port; you can also get an optional smart card reader.\n\nIt is a good-looking system with a silver all-aluminum case. The backlit keyboard has more travel than most of the laptops I\u2019ve worked with recently, and the typing experience was comfortable. I also appreciated the nice-sized touchpad. All that being said, I didn\u2019t enjoy working with the system long-term because I found the somewhat sharp bottom edge of the notebook uncomfortable when it occasionally scraped against my wrist.\n\nThe Latitude is currently available in several different configurations, starting at $1,599 and going well over $2,000, depending on the options. It\u2019s a solid, compact business system with a login system that saves time and trouble. While I wouldn\u2019t buy this laptop solely for the ExpressSign-in tech, it is the kind of tech that can make things that much easier for you. Certainly, it feels a lot more efficient than typing in a password or even swiping a fingerprint sensor.\n\nRight now, the Latitude 7400 2-in-1 is the only system using ExpressSign-in. With any luck, that tech will expand to future business and consumer laptops. In the meantime, it will give you something to show off to your seatmate on those long plane trips.", "description": "The Latitude 7400 2-in-1, a recently introduced business laptop, features a new ExpressSign-in feature that takes Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello facial recognition app one step further: it looks for your face and then automatically signs you in to the system even if it\u2019s in sleep mode.", "authors": ["Barbara Krasnoff", "Jun"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zg4LVRnJmpXOBnz5h2eYd2jdL5I=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16309201/akrales_190530_3455_0046.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-05"}
