For instance, you can also find deals and deep discounts on Green Monday, Memorial Day, Prime Day, Labor Day, during back-to-school season, and even on Columbus Day.\n\nAlso: Weird gadgets that are really useful\n\nOK, so here's a mini Columbus Day deep-dive: A highly reliable Google search tells us it's a US federal holiday that commemorates the arrival of Christopher Columbus to North America in 1492. However, some people do not observe it and prefer to celebrate Native American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day instead. Even if you don't partake in the holiday, you can still go shopping and score some great deals.\n\nZDNet has rounded up all the best tech deals for Columbus Day 2019.\n\nWhen is Columbus Day in 2019?\n\nColumbus Day is the second Monday in October. This year, it is Oct. 14.\n\nBest Columbus Day 2019 deals\n\nThe deals below are available now and throughout Columbus Day.\n\nTCL 32-inch Roku 1080p TV for $150 ($190 regular)\n\nSee it now: TCL 32-inch Roku TV at Amazon\n\n\n\nSure, it's 1080p, but it comes with Roku, and you can't beat that $150 price. Pick this up and hang it in your office. You can use it as a second monitor, or to watch the news, whatever!\n\nVizio 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $260 ($428 regular)\n\nSee it now: VIZIO 50-inch TV at Walmart\n\nIf you prefer a 4K TV -- and something bigger than 32 inches -- look no further. Vizio marked down its 50-inch smart TV by nearly half off for a limited time, making it hard to ignore.\n\nMicrosoft Surface Pro for $597 ($799 regular)\n\nSee it now: Microsoft Surface Pro at Amazon\n\nMicrosoft recently launched new Surface devices, so, naturally, last year's Surface models are all discounted, including the Surface Pro, which is about $200 off at the moment. With this 2-in-1, you can easily get your work done either at home or while on the go.\n\nGoogle Pixel 3A 64GB for $349 ($399 regular)\n\n\n\nSee it now: Google Pixel 3A at Amazon\n\nGoogle launched this budget phone just this year -- and it's already $50 off. Perhaps that's because the new Pixel 4 is due out soon. However, a direct follow-up to the Pixel 3A is still months away.\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 64GB for $460 ($799 regular)\n\nSee it now: Google Pixel 3 at Amazon\n\nGoogle's latest flagship (for a few days anyway) is nearly half off! If you don't care about the Pixel 4, which is coming soon, then you might as well pick up its predecessor on sale.\n\nMoto G7 Power 64GB for $172 ($300 regular)\n\nSee it now: Moto G7 Power at Amazon\n\nMotorola recently discounted most of its phones -- and its G7 Power is still $130 off.\n\n12.9-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi for $943 ($999 regular)\n\nSee it now: Apple iPad Pro at Amazon\n\nIt's rare to find deals on Apple devices, so if you spot a discount, even if just $50 off, grab it.\n\n10.5-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi and Cellular or $579 ($750 regular)\n\nSee it now: Apple iPad Pro at Amazon\n\nApple's smaller iPad Pro is also $150 off. We doubt it'll be any cheaper before Black Friday.\n\nApple Beats Powerbeats Pro for $200 ($250)\n\nSee it now: Beats Powerbeats Pro at Amazon\n\nWe price-checked these Powerbeats Pro, and they're now the cheapest we've ever spotted. They debuted last spring and feature Apple's H1 wireless chip, hands-free \"Hey Siri\" voice functionality, the ability to switch between paired Apple devices, and Lightning charging.\n\nAirPods with Wireless Charging Case for $169 ($199 regular)\n\nSee it now: Apple AirPods at Amazon\n\nApple's other wireless headphones -- the ones with the stems -- are more for casual wearers, and they've been reduced by $30 at a few different retailers, including Amazon.\n\nBose SoundSport headphones, $39 ($99 regular)\n\nSee it now: Bose SoundSport In-Ear headphones at Walmart\n\nYes, these are wired headphones, but good luck finding anything Bose-branded that's cheaper. It's almost a no-brainer purchase: Slap down $40, and get yourself a nice pair of buds to wear while you're exercising, commuting to work -- anything really.\n\nApple Watch Series 4 GPS for $349 ($399 regular)\n\nSee it now: Apple Watch Series 4 at Amazon\n\nAgain, Apple devices are hardly ever on sale, especially its latest-generation goodies. Having said that, the Apple Watch is $50 off, and we don't know when it'll be this price again.\n\n\n\nGoogle Home Mini two-pack for $78 ($98 regular)\n\nSee it now: Google Home Mini (two-pack) at Walmart\n\nFor less than $80, you can pick up these and add some smarts to your home office.\n\nGoogle Nest Hub for $129 ($149 regular)\n\nSee it now: Google Nest Hub at Walmart\n\nIf you want a smart display -- rather than a smart speaker -- for your office, here you go: Google's own Nest Hub is $20 off. While not a huge discount, it probably won't get any cheaper before the holidays.\n\n\n\nEcho Dot third-generation for $40 ($50 regular)\n\nSee it now: Echo Dot at Amazon\n\nThose of you who like Alexa more than a Google Assistant might want to consider the latest Echo Dot, which is Amazon's smallest smart speaker available. It's currently $10 off.\n\n\n\nEcho Show 5 for $65 ($90 regular)\n\nSee it now: Echo Show 5 at Amazon\n\nAgain, if you prefer a display, then Amazon has you covered, with a deal on Echo Show 5.\n\nEcovacs Deebot Ozmo 950 for $679 with code ($799 regular)\n\nSee it now: Ecovacs Deebot Ozmo 950 at Wellbots with VAC40\n\nLastly, Wellbots is offering ZDNet readers an exclusive promo code on the Ecovacs robot vacuum. It's $120 off for a limited time when you apply the code VAC40 at checkout.\n\nFor more great deals on devices, gadgetry, and tech for your enterprise, business, or home office, see ZDNet's Business Bargain Hunter blog.
