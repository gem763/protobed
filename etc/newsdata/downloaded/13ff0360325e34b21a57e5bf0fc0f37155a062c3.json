(Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nThe popular heartburn medication Zantac is being recalled in the U.S. and Canada after an investigation revealed that the drug may be contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical.\n\nThe recall, which drugmaker Sanofi called \u201cprecautionary\u201d and \u201cvoluntary\u201d in a statement on Friday, follows a Sept. 13 announcement by the Food and Drug Administration that low levels of NDMA (N-Nitrosodimethylamine) had been found in ranitidine \u2014 a stomach acid-blocking medication sold under the name Zantac. \u201cNDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests,\u201d noted the agency.\n\nIn the statement, Sanofi said the Zantac recall stems from \u201cpossible contamination.\u201d \u201cDue to inconsistencies in preliminary test results of the active ingredient used in the U.S. and Canadian products, Sanofi has made the decision to conduct the voluntary recall in the U.S. and Canada as the investigation continues,\u201d the statement read, adding, \u201cThe company is working with health authorities to determine the level and extent of the recall.\u201d\n\nWhile Sanofi makes Zantac, several different companies distribute its generic version. One of them, Sandoz (the generic drug arm of Novartis), had already halted its worldwide distribution of ranitidine after the initial investigation came out last month.\n\nThe recall comes in the wake of CVS, Walmart, Walgreens, and Rite Aide halting sales of Zantac \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nHowever, in last month\u2019s statement, the FDA didn\u2019t appear concerned by the amounts of NDMA found in the heartburn medications. Janet Woodcock, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said: \"Although NDMA may cause harm in large amounts, the levels the FDA is finding in ranitidine from preliminary tests barely exceed amounts you might expect to find in common foods.\"\n\nIn a post for Harvard Medical School, pharmacist and associate professor of medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Joshua Gagne, seemed to echo the FDA\u2019s statement, writing: \u201cIt is important to know that the NDMA in ranitidine products does not pose any immediate health risks,\u201d adding that the FDA and ranitidine drug manufacturers have not received \u201cany reports of adverse events related to NDMA found in ranitidine.\u201d Gagne also noted that, although NDMA is classified as a probable carcinogen, it \u201cmay cause cancer only after exposure to high doses over a long period of time.\u201d\n\nThat may explain why the FDA hasn\u2019t called for patients to stop taking drugs with ranitidine. That said, the government agency does suggest that people taking over-the-counter ranitidine medications \u201ccould consider using other OTC medicines approved for their condition,\u201d adding, \u201cThere are multiple drugs on the market that are approved for the same or similar uses as ranitidine.\u201d\n\nFor those who are concerned about taking their heartburn medications, Benyam Muluneh, a clinical pharmacist practitioner at the University of North Carolina\u2019s Eshelman School of Pharmacy, told Yahoo Lifestyle that there are several other options to help manage symptoms and suggested that people first get in touch with their healthcare providers (or local pharmacist) for recommendations.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The popular heartburn medication Zantac is being recalled in the U.S. and Canada after an investigation revealed that the drug may be contaminated with a cancer-causing chemical.", "authors": ["Rachel Grumman Bender", "Beauty", "Style Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1ULwnJlV9DsOlXws5wE5uw--~B/aD0zNzc0O3c9NTY2MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/5be87f50-f1e1-11e9-bffe-9240c1967448", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
