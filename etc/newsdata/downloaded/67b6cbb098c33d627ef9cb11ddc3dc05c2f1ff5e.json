He\u2019s got a documentary out to this effect, and now a forthcoming book.\n\nRose has transparently been attempting to get back in the NBA culture\u2019s good graces, which is unlikely given some of the details of his testimony and his inability to get back to stardom on the court.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMeanwhile, Rose\u2019s experience with the New York Knicks for 64 games in 2016-17 is of interest given the personalities involved \u2014 Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony, to name a couple.\n\nIn an excerpt from his book, Rose said that it was Jackson\u2019s devotion to the Triangle offense that helped doom the Knicks that season. In particular, Rose said that Jackson\u2019s plan didn\u2019t account for the personnel available to him.\n\nVia NY Post:\n\nAs for me, I liked Phil, but, come on, man, you\u2019re still running the triangle? He was still forcing them to run it. I\u2019m a slasher, a driving point guard. The triangle is okay, but not for the personnel we had. Melo couldn\u2019t play that way, didn\u2019t want to. \u2026 Jo and I used to talk about that all the time. Phil wanted us to play a certain way and we had to listen. What can you do? Early on in the season, Phil really didn\u2019t force anything. But as time went on, it converted all the way to the triangle and we played through that almost the whole year. \u2026 We were a new team with new players and a new coach, and because of Melo and the way he played, we needed to do something now, and you need some time with that offense.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is much the same sentiment that many people had during this time in the NBA community. Jackson seemed like he was stuck in a certain era and thought that it was Tex Winter\u2019s system that won him games as opposed to the generational Talent he was blessed with in Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kobe Bryant, and Shaquille O\u2019Neal.\n\nSeveral years later, the Knicks aren\u2019t in any better shape and Carmelo doesn\u2019t have an NBA team. For many, it\u2019s possible that that New York team signaled the end of their time making an impact in the NBA", "description": "This is much the same sentiment that many people had during this time in the NBA community.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iVE17Mlkc0mVX1LdCgWt7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjMuMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dyaWvjn6w7qBuMH1PSJSpg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/829d3b0f0ceba7849ef0edaebfdaf58f", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
