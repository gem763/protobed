QuoteWizard, an auto insurance tool created by Lending Tree, combed through the Federal Highway Administration's data to rank the states on three categories: the fraction of roads that were in poor condition, the number of bridges that were deemed \"structurally deficient\", and how much the state spends on road repairs.\n\n\"Taxpayer funded highway capital delegated for states to maintain roads isn't enough to cover necessary repairs,\" the team behind the analysis said.\n\n\"Many states are spending the majority of their highway capital on expansion instead of maintenance of roads. At this rate, it becomes a never ending game of maintenance catch up. On top of taxpayer dollars, it's estimated that driving on roads in poor condition costs motorists $120 billion in vehicle repairs and operating costs. That's $533 per driver.\"\n\nHere's where they found the state of repairs to be the worst:", "description": "Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Mississippi aren't faring much better, a study of Federal highways data shows.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8d1a102e22af0bc83c9bf0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
