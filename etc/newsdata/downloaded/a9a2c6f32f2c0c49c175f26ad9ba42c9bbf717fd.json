We\u2019re told to ditch the straws and forgo plastic cups. We indoctrinate our kids with the \u201crinse and reuse\u201d mantra. But are these efforts futile in preventing climate change?\n\n\n\nAmerican novelist Jonathan Franzen has unleashed a maelstrom of controversy by asserting that in order to prepare for the climate apocalypse we must admit we can\u2019t prevent it. He recently published an essay in The New Yorker making his case, in which he readily admitted he\u2019s no scientist, but maintained society needs to stop pretending that efforts to heal Mother Earth will prevent the inevitable.\n\n\n\nClimate scientists such as Kate Marvel took umbrage with Franzen\u2019s essay. In a rebuttal, she reaffirmed what the science community believes: that given we understand the drivers of climate change we can work to make a difference.\n\n\n\nToday, we ask our panel who is ultimately responsible for preventing climate change and ... is it even possible?\n\n\n\nOn this episode of The Stream, we speak with:\n\n\n\nGenevieve Guenther @DoctorVive\n\nFounder, End Climate Silence\n\nendclimatesilence.org\n\n\n\nArn Menconi @ArnMenconi\n\nPeace & Climate Change Activist\n\n\n\nSara Peach @sarapeach\n\nAuthor, #AskSara Advice Column\n\nyaleclimateconnections.org\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nThe controversy over Jonathan Franzen's climate change opinions, explained - Vox\n\nWho's most responsible for global warming - The New York Times\n\nHome is always worth it - Medium\n\nWhat do you think?
