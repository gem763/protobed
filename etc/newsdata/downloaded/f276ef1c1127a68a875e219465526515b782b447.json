Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling in the city's affairs and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nChinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism \"will be crushed\".\n\nThe China Daily newspaper said Sunday's rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should \"stop trying the patience of the central government\".\n\nA senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events in Hong Kong.\n\n\"The freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected. As the president has said, \u2018They're looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy',\" the official said.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [HONG KONG] Hundreds of uniformed school students, many wearing masks, formed human chains in districts across Hong Kong on Monday in support of anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city. .
