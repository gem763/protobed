Elon Musk/SpaceX via Twitter\n\nElon Musk, the company's founder and CEO, envisions the vehicle as a shiny steel two-stage launch system that may stand nearly 400 feet tall and reduce the cost of access to space by a factor of 100 to 1,000 by having fully reusable hardware.\n\nIt may be capable of sending massive payloads into orbit, humans to the moon and Mars, and scores of passengers around the world in half an hour.\n\nRead more: SpaceX is eyeing these 9 places on Mars for its first Starship rocket missions\n\nThe new regulatory review, which the Federal Aviation Administration has not yet published to its website, came about after the company substantially changed its vision for Boca Chica. Business Insider was sent PDFs of the files (below) via email from an FAA representative.\n\nThe FAA's main document is a 23-page \"written reevaluation,\" which addresses the potential impacts of SpaceX's new plans. It's accompanied by a separate five-page addendum that addresses a large brush fire the company accidentally started during an experimental launch in July.\n\nThe two documents follow a years-long environmental assessment that the FAA, SpaceX, the state of Texas, and local authorities hammered out by July 2014. That original corpus of more than 1,600 pages is an exhaustive (though now dated) official review of SpaceX's site that the FAA uses in part to approve or deny the company's launch licenses there.\n\nThe new assessment covers SpaceX's shift away from developing a commercial spaceport and confronts its new reality as a skunkworks for Starship.\n\nThe FAA reevaluated SpaceX's site after a big change in the company's plans\n\nA May 2014 rendering of a Falcon Heavy rocket at SpaceX's South Texas launch site near Boca Chica Beach. The company ultimately changed its plans and design for the facility. SpaceX via FAA\n\nSpaceX's site is located about 20 miles east of Brownsville, a few miles north of the US-Mexico border, and about half a mile from Boca Chica Beach.\n\nThe company originally agreed to build a commercial spaceport by spending about $100 million on the effort, including some $15 million worth of incentives from county and state governments. Space missions were supposed to start launching by the end of 2017, with up to a dozen trips each year.\n\nFalcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets were to take off from a large launchpad equipped with a flame trench (to redirect hot rocket exhaust), a 250,000-gallon deluge system to flood the pad with water (to suppress sound and cut fire risk), lightning protection towers, and other safety features.\n\nYet before SpaceX could do anything, it had to go through a gauntlet of filing an environmental impact statement with the FAA. The company spent years studying the site and meeting with local, state, and federal officials.\n\nThe resulting EIS captures the potential environmental impacts to the area, and it was finalized in July 2014. For a variety of reasons, though, SpaceX's construction in the area slowed to a crawl almost as soon as it began.\n\nRead more: Elon Musk is building SpaceX's Mars rockets in a tiny Texas hamlet. But getting them off the ground there may be harder than he imagined.\n\nBy May 2018, Musk said that SpaceX was dropping its commercial-spaceport plan and instead dedicating the site to building and flying Mars rocket-ship prototypes. The company is now using different launch vehicles (Starship prototypes), different fuel (methane instead of RP-1, a rocket-grade kerosene), and a new rate of launches, as well as switching up construction projects and other details.\n\nA comparison of SpaceX and NASA rocket systems. Yutong Yuan/Samantha Lee/Business Insider\n\nThis shift in plans prompted the FAA to step in, reevaluate, and square these new details with the original EIS to see whether there'd be any unaddressed public-safety threats or environmental damage.\n\nThe document neatly lays out the crux of SpaceX's experimental test program:\n\n\"SpaceX remains committed in its mission to colonize Mars. To achieve this mission, SpaceX is developing a new rocket called the Starship and Super Heavy. A key part of the mission is developing the Starship spacecraft. In order to fully develop the vehicle, an experimental test program is needed. The proposed experimental test program involves testing a spacecraft \u2014 the Starship \u2014 which would serve as the second stage of the rocket. The objective of the experimental test program is to perform a suborbital space flight from the Texas Launch Site.\"\n\nDespite SpaceX's substantial evolution of its Boca Chica site, the FAA found few major deviations, at least from an impact standpoint \u2014 so it determined a new (and very arduous) supplemental EIS process was not required. If anything, the documents suggest SpaceX's new Starship development would decrease the company's disruption in the area, including noise levels, wildlife effects, and wetland impacts.\n\n\"The modifications remain entirely within the property boundary and project area described and analyzed in the 2014 EIS,\" the FAA said.\n\nSpaceX built its first launch pad within about 1.5 miles, or 2.4 kilometers, of a nearby community called Boca Chica Village. Despite this, and the company's inadvertent brush fire coming within a few thousand feet of the hamlet, the FAA determined \"there were no public safety concerns\" due to a \"pre-established safety zone.\"\n\n\"All mitigation efforts due to the brush fire were controlled by US Fish and Wildlife Fire Management and the Brownsville Fire Department,\" a SpaceX representative told Business Insider. \"The determination that this fire presented no risk to public safety was made by those agencies.\"\n\nThough the FAA can request public feedback to incorporate into its written reevaluations, a representative for the regulator told Business Insider the document \"is final\" and \"will not have any comment period.\"\n\nThe documents also outline a 3-phase Starship development program\n\nA \"Phase 1\" construction layout for Starship. (The underground water tank was swapped for three above-ground tanks.) FAA/SpaceX\n\nThe main FAA document, which was finalized May 21, contains figures on the amounts of methane, oxygen, water, helium, and other \"commodities\" SpaceX thinks it needs for Starship testing in Texas. (The company has since built a second Starship development site in Cocoa, Florida.)\n\nThe document also lays out a three-phase test program, which it says \"would last around 2 to 3 years\":\n\nPhase 1 : Tests of ground systems and fueling, a handful of rocket engine test-firings, and several \"small hops\" of a few centimeters off the ground. The document also includes graphic layouts, like the one above, showing the placement of water tanks, liquid methane and oxygen storage tanks (Starship's fuels), and other launch pad infrastructure.\n\n: Tests of ground systems and fueling, a handful of rocket engine test-firings, and several \"small hops\" of a few centimeters off the ground.

FAA/SpaceX\n\nSpaceX's representative said the company had officially ended Phase 1 and was in the midst of Phase 2.\n\nPhase 1 centered on SpaceX's first Starship prototype, called Starhopper. Sections of the shiny steel vehicle were first spotted in social-media photos posted from Boca Chica in late 2018.\n\nThe vehicle was mostly completed in February, though its nose cone was quickly blown off by powerful Texas winds. SpaceX decided the nosecone wasn't needed and launched Starhopper as a stubby version of its former, rocket-shaped self. The vehicle flew on short tethered flights in April, a roughly 6o-foot, or 20 meter, \"hop\" in July, and a flight in August that soared the vehicle to about 490 feet, or 150 meters \u2014 a key step described in Phase 2.\n\nRead more: The FAA made SpaceX boost its accident insurance 33-fold, to $100 million, before Starhopper's last launch. Here's why.\n\nDuring that latest and final flight in August, Starhopper also translated across its launch site and landed on a new concrete slab that matches the layout of the Phase 2 Pad.\n\nConstruction of the Starship Mk1 prototype in Boca Chica in April. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The FAA document says Phase 3 \u2014 SpaceX's most ambitious near-term goal in Texas \u2014 had not yet begun, adding that its exact details would depend on how the company's first two phases went.\n\n\"SpaceX would be required to submit data and information to the FAA so the FAA can conduct another environmental review before issuing any new or modified licenses or permits to conduct these operations,\" the FAA wrote of Phase 3.\n\nIt's unclear whether the rough Phase 3 plan in the FAA document is still valid. SpaceX is known for rapid shifts in development, and when asked about the phase, the company said only that it was \"working directly with FAA to maintain environmental compliance as our testing plans develop.\"\n\nPhase 3, however, is likely now more ambitious. Based on tweets from Musk, it may entail launching a new, roughly 180-foot prototype known as Starship Mark 1 (Mk1) a dozen miles high and beyond this fall.\n\n\"Aiming for 20km flight in Oct & orbit attempt shortly thereafter,\" Musk tweeted on August 28.\n\nMusk added that he would provide an update on the overall Starship development program on September 28. Previously, he said he would deliver that presentation from Boca Chica, Texas \u2014 possibly to do so with a fitting backdrop.\n\n\"Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time,\" he said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration's \"written reevaluation\" is SpaceX's ticket to launching orbital-class Starship prototypes from Boca Chica, Texas.", "authors": ["Dave Mosher"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d71627b2e22af04ec463fdb-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
