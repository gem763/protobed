However there is a backstop. If the sector fails to innovate and manage emissions, it could be brought into the ETS as early as 2022.\n\nIn a joint statement signed by the major industry leaders including DairyNZ, Federated Farmers and Beef and Lamb New Zealand, the sector welcomed the collaborative approach, and said it was \u201cpleased\u201d agriculture would not have its emissions taxed.\n\n\u201cAchieving this programme of work will not be cheap, and it will not be easy \u2026 we welcome this pragmatic and sensible decision by the government to work in partnership with industry to achieve tangible on-farm change and hope that it might provide a blueprint for the way we work together to solve environmental challenges in the future.\u201d\n\nThe five-year action plan will include government incentives for early adopters, improved tools for estimating and benchmarking farm emissions, integrated farm plans that include a climate module, and recognition of on-farm climate mitigation efforts such as small plantings, riparian areas and natural cover.\n\nThe opposition National party\u2019s spokesman on climate change, Scott Simpson, said the ETS tax was hanging over farmers\u2019 heads if they didn\u2019t adapt quickly enough.\n\nForcing farmers out of business would also raise global emissions, Simpson said, because New Zealand would be forced to import more food.\n\n\u201cNational has a clear criteria that would need to be met before we\u2019re comfortable with agriculture entering the ETS or a similar pricing mechanism. There needs to be science-based mitigation options available for farmers that don\u2019t lead to herd culling and decreased food production,\u201d Simpson said.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand would have the only farmers in the world to be a part of an ETS. It\u2019s important we are not put at a disadvantage to our international competitors or we risk losing our valuable market share to a less sustainable producer.\u201d\n\nAs well as government grants totalling more than NZ$200m, industry bodies said they would also commit at least NZ$25m a year to boost emissions-reduction efforts around the country.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Farmers given until 2022 to make changes or pay higher taxes as part of plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c37624027ddb823aa3f824318a32322ef7b864a/0_0_5280_3167/master/5280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8dc8549fcf7438c581ae3e972c847938", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
