Records on Companies House show Ms Arcuri and Hayes were the only directors of the now defunct firm.\n\nA report by the Sunday Times also revealed the string of foreign trips Ms Arcuri attended along with Mr Johnson in the following years.\n\nThis week, questions have been raised over the validity of a \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to another of her companies, Hacker House, by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, in January this year. Companies were only eligible if they were UK-based.\n\nBut it has emerged Hacker House\u2019s registered address was a flat in Macclesfield Ms Arcuri and her partner had moved out of \u2013 and back to the US \u2013 apparently before the application for the grant was made.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

If the answer is no, as I suspect it might be, then this may well become a matter for the police.\u201d\n\nMr Watson also said the repeated awarding of funds to a company which had provided a platform for Mr Yiannopolous was also concerning.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very troubling that Boris Johnson chose to appear at an event with a far-right figure like Milo Yiannopolous, and that an organisation that gave Yiannopolous a platform received public money.\n\n\u201cI understand that City Hall are currently investigating Johnson\u2019s connections to Arcuri during his time as Mayor, and the Prime Minister should comply fully with that work. It is high time that Boris Johnson learned he cannot just shirk his responsibilities.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson is now under increasing pressure to explain his friendship with Ms Arcuri, the repeated foreign trade missions they both attended, and City Hall\u2019s decision to award thousands of pounds to her company InnoTech in advertising.\n\nThe prime minister has said he will comply with a London Assembly order to explain his links to Ms Arcuri \u2013 but said his former colleagues were \u201cbarking up the wrong tree\u201d.\n\nMr Watson added: \u201cIt is a deeply worrying pattern of behaviour that speaks to the fundamental question of Boris Johnson\u2019s character. Can he be trusted with public money? Can he be trusted to behave in a way expected of those in the highest office?\n\n\u201cThere are still questions that need answering, but the broader truth is clear: Boris Johnson is not fit for office.\u201d\n\nMr Watson\u2019s office said he was writing to Nicky Morgan, the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, asking her to publish all documents relating to the grant application, but also to carry out an audit into how the funds allocated by the government have been spent so far.\n\nThe terms of the grant stipulate that companies in receipt of funding may be subjected to random audits.\n\nA DCMS spokesperson told The Independent: \u201cFunding for this scheme was awarded through open and fair competition. We regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness.\u201d\n\nDowning Street has been contacted for comment.", "description": "Police could be called in to investigate how companies operated by Jennifer Arcuri came to be awarded \u00a3100,000 of public money during a time when she was close friends with Boris Johnson, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has suggested.", "authors": ["Harry Cockburn"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/19/21/breaking-news-image-new.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
