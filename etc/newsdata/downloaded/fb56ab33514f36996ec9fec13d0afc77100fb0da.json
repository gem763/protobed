Not with two consecutive trips to play Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City, you imagine. Southampton found themselves in that unenviable position at the start of the night. At its end, they were probably relieved to only lose 3-1.\n\nIt is three years and three days since City last suffered a defeat in this competition and, given how seriously Guardiola appears to take the EFL Cup, few would bet against a fifth triumph in seven years come February. Even if Southampton had been in any sort of form, victory and progress to the quarter-finals would always be a tall order.\n\nA Nicolas Otamendi header and a Sergio Aguero brace secured City\u2019s place in Wednesday night\u2019s last-eight draw. On a night which largely saw the holders camped in Southampton\u2019s half, they could and perhaps should have scored more. Instead, Jack Stephens was allowed to reduce the deficit.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Unsurprisingly, the former City goalkeeper Angus Gunn was among those sacrificed.\n\nGuardiola, meanwhile, handed a debut to Tommy Doyle, a highly-rated 18-year-old midfielder with sky blue blood. One of his grandfathers, Glyn Pardoe, remains the youngest player to represent the club, 57 years on from his debut. The other, the late Mike Doyle, was City\u2019s EFL Cup-winning captain in 1976.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Seconds after it, the home crowd cheekily chanted \u201cwe want 10!\u201d They would have to make do with just three and were made to wait nearly twenty minutes for the first.\n\nOn his first start since a calamitous display in the defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Otamendi ended Southampton\u2019s short-lived resistance. After a short corner was played square to Bernardo Silva, the centre-half comfortably won an aerial battle at the far post to nod past Gunn\u2019s replacement Alex McCarthy.\n\nCity were dominant enough to put the game to bed inside the first 45 minutes but only went into the break two up. The second, in fairness, came from a fine flowing move through Southampton\u2019s midfield, incorporating Phil Foden, Bernardo and Riyad Mahrez before Aguero volleyed Kyle Walker\u2019s cut-back from the byline.\n\nMahrez was proving to be a particular nuisance for Southampton but could not find the goal his display merited. One menacing attempt from the edge of the penalty area was blocked unconvincingly by Jan Bednarek, only for the ball to fall kindly into the path of Aguero. He made no mistake from close range.\n\nAt that point, Southampton were yet to register a shot on Claudio Bravo\u2019s goal but City\u2019s cup \u2018keeper would be busier in the final half hour. With a quarter-of-an-hour remaining, he was retrieving the ball from the back of his net. Stephens had already wasted one far-post opportunity from a corner a few minutes earlier. He converted second time around.\n\nGuardiola immediately ordered one young substitute preparing to come on \u2013 Ian Poveda-Ocampo \u2013 to return to the bench. Yet even if the City manager was taking no chances, there would be no turnaround. Southampton\u2019s redemption will have to wait until at least Saturday, when they visit the Etihad once again.", "description": "What is the best way to recover from a 9-0 top-flight home defeat, the biggest\u00a0in the 131-year history of the Football League?
