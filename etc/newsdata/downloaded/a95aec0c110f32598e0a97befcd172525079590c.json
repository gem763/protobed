The black hole\u2019s tremendous gravitational forces tear the star to shreds, with some of its material tossed into space and the rest plunging into the black hole, forming a disk of hot, bright gas as it is swallowed.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, we are able to measure the rate at which it gets brighter after it starts brightening, and we also observed a drop in its temperature and brightness that is unique,\u201d Holoien said.\n\nObserving the oscillation of light as the black hole gobbles the star and spews stellar material in an outward spiral could help astronomers understand the black hole\u2019s behaviour, a scientific mystery since physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s work more than a century ago examined gravity\u2019s influence on light in motion.", "description": "Scientists have captured a view of a colossal black hole violently ripping apart a doomed star, illustrating a extraordinary and chaotic cosmic event from beginning to end for the first time using NASA's planet-hunting telescope.", "authors": ["Joey Routlette", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435357553&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T036", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
