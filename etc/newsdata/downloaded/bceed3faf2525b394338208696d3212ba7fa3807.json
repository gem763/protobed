But it has yet to live up to its promise, which included making the yuan fully convertible under capital accounts and allowing free cross-border cargo flows without any customs intervention.\n\nAmong the first batch of institutions that signed pacts with the Lingang FTZ administration on Friday were the mainland\u2019s largest five banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.\n\nBut not a single foreign institutions was among them.\n\nMore from South China Morning Post:\n\nThis article Shanghai offers cash incentives of up to US$8.5 million to lure financial institutions to Lingang free-trade zone area first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "Shanghai is offering cash subsidies of up to US$8.46 million to financial institutions that set up branches in the new part of its expanded free-trade zone, as the city strives to create a buzzing free-market hub to rival Hong Kong.The municipality announced on Friday that banks, insurers, brokerages", "authors": ["Daniel Ren"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RcUZ.KAGK6HN.Bs6LmhHLA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/ca296e811c583c0eb2698cecd1e0e845", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
