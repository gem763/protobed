But we can do it,\u201d he was quoted saying in the AFR.\n\nCannon-Brookes, 39, became a billionaire through his stake in the software firm Atlassian, which he co-founded with Scott Farquhar.\n\nHe made his name in the power sector in 2016 when he challenged Tesla Inc\u2019s (TSLA.O) Elon Musk via Twitter to build the world\u2019s biggest battery in 100 days to help prevent blackouts in South Australia, the country\u2019s most wind power reliant state.\n\nThe bet was dismissed as outrageous at the time, but Tesla built the battery on time and the project has since proven to be profitable in helping manage power supply on South Australia\u2019s shaky grid.", "description": "Atlassian Corp co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes has pledged to help fund an ambitious A$20 billion ($14 billion) project to supply solar power from northern Australia to Singapore by a subsea cable, an Australian newspaper reported on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433558909&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8O01P", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
