Supreme Court is quiet.", "language": "en", "text": "Sometimes, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor said recently, people ask how she has dealt with the arrival of her newest colleague, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the allegations of sexual misconduct that accompanied his confirmation.\n\nHer answer is not one to which other liberals have subscribed.\n\n\u201cWe are all human beings, we all have pasts,\u201d Sotomayor told a judicial conference in Santa Fe last week, according to a Wall Street Journal report. \u201cNow, whether things occurred or didn\u2019t occur, all of that is irrelevant. It is yesterday, today is today, and moving forward, I have to work with him.\u201d\n\nRevivals of allegations against Kavanaugh roil the White House, Capitol Hill and the Democratic presidential nomination trail.\n\nBut at the Supreme Court, once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re in. It is a no-roil zone.\n\n[New report on Kavanaugh brings calls for impeachment, as well as defenses]\n\n\n\nFrom left, Supreme Court Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh, Neil M. Gorsuch and Elena Kagan share a laugh during a White House event in November. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nKavanaugh, 54, has done his best to keep it that way since his arrival nearly a year ago . He\u2019s been an equal-opportunity collaborator, in the majority more than any other justice in cases the court decided in his first term. He agreed with some of the court\u2019s liberal members almost as much as he agreed with some of the court\u2019s conservatives, including Neil M. Gorsuch, the other justice chosen by President Trump.\n\nSuch evenness has brought grumbles from some conservatives about what they consider Kavanaugh\u2019s go-slow approach. He has balanced that by voting in favor of every important Trump administration initiative that has reached the court during his tenure.\n\nTrump responded to allegations against Kavanaugh in a new book by two New York Times reporters with a ferocious defense on Twitter. \u201cDO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!\u201d\n\nAt the Supreme Court, where nine people are bound together by life tenure and equally weighted votes: silence.\n\nThere is no doubt that justices \u2014 most especially Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. \u2014 do not relish another controversy bound to intensify the political battle over what they strive to portray as a nonpartisan court.\n\n[Roberts says Supreme Court serves one nation, not one party]\n\nBut there are institutional and strategic reasons to live and let live. The court\u2019s decisions will not be respected unless the court is, the justices say. And when five votes determine which view of the law prevails, today\u2019s adversary can be tomorrow\u2019s ally.\n\nJust a month after the bitter partisan battle over Kavanaugh resulted in a 50-to-48 Senate confirmation vote last fall, Justice Elena Kagan spoke to a group of law students at the University of Toronto.\n\nMaybe she shouldn\u2019t ask, a young woman in the audience said, but how can the court claim legitimacy on issues such as violence against women when two of its members have been accused of sexual misconduct? She was referring to Kavanaugh and Justice Clarence Thomas, whose 1991 confirmation exploded with Anita Hill\u2019s charges of sexual harassment.\n\nYou\u2019re right, Kagan, one of three liberal women on the court, told the student: \u201cYou should not have asked me that question.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m a part of this institution. I care about it a lot, I care about my colleagues a lot, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m not going to be talking about.\u201d\n\nThomas recounted in his memoir that, as soon as he was confirmed, Justice Byron White came to welcome him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you got here. All that matters now is what you do here,\u201d Thomas recalled White saying.\n\nWhen Roberts last fall wanted to directly confront the idea of the Supreme Court as a political body, he chose to paraphrase \u201cour newest colleague\u201d to say that \u201cwe do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest, we serve one nation.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the court closes ranks. The justices are linked for life, working closely together, getting to know one another\u2019s families. Thomas has been at the high court nearly 30 years , Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer more than 25. The justices can write brutally about each other\u2019s legal opinions, but they swear the personal affection is real.\n\n[Ginsburg gently pushes back on criticism of the court]\n\nKavanaugh was hardly a stranger when he was elevated to the high court. He was a former clerk to White and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whom he replaced. He served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Roberts, Thomas and Ginsburg had served.\n\nHe is a longtime insider in the Republican legal establishment, yet his clerks went on to work for almost every Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe bonhomie on the court is reinforced by tradition. For instance, a new justice is welcomed with a dinner organized by the previously junior member. Thus the stoic Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. honored Sotomayor\u2019s heritage with a Spanish guitar player. As he promotes his new book, Gorsuch has been telling reporters how he recruited some of the \u201cracing presidents\u201d who perform at Washington Nationals games for baseball-lover Kavanaugh\u2019s dinner.\n\nAt speaking events this summer, Ginsburg praised Kavanaugh for hiring only female clerks for his initial term, which for the first time meant that more women than men filled the prestigious jobs. She noted that she had assigned him an important majority opinion in a case where he crossed over to join the liberals.\n\nAt the Santa Fe event, Sotomayor discussed the strategic advantage of keeping your ideological adversaries close.\n\n\u201cThere is common ground in selected areas,\u201d Sotomayor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important not to forget that because those agreements are important in building bridges that help you in the future, perhaps, in slowing things down.\u201d\n\nIn their first year together, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh diverged on issues more than any pair of justices nominated by the same president since President George H.W. Bush\u2019s pair of Thomas and former justice David Souter. Gorsuch has tended to side with Thomas on the right, Kavanaugh closer to Roberts at the court\u2019s center.\n\nFor lawyers on the left, that means their best hope \u2014 even if slim \u2014 is those two. Trump wrote on Twitter that the continuing investigations into Kavanaugh are intended to \u201cscare him into turning Liberal!\u201d\n\nKavanaugh has kept a low profile on the court. He\u2019s not a recluse \u2014 he\u2019s coached his daughters\u2019 basketball teams, just as he did in the past. On Friday, he was at a ceremony for Judge Naomi Rao, who took his spot on the D.C. Circuit.\n\nBut he has turned down almost all speaking engagements. There was a noncontroversial talk at a judicial conference in the spring, and his law school teaching gig this summer took place about 4,000 miles from Washington, in England.\n\nAs of now, his speaking debut could be in November, when he has pledged to address the national lawyers meeting of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that has been instrumental in Trump\u2019s successful nominations to the federal judiciary.\n\nHis friends are braced for other events beyond his control.
