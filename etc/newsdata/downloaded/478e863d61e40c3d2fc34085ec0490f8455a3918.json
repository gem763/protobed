The most fashionable wristwear right now has little to do with styles or complications, but everything to do with brand power. Despite the fact there are hundreds of brands manufacturing timepieces with incredible levels of accuracy and finishing, just four dominate today\u2019s desirability rankings: Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille.\n\nDon\u2019t merely take my word for it \u2013 every retailer and collector I speak to is at one on this assessment, with \u201cunobtainium\u201d surfacing as the word to describe the most popular watches from the above brands. So popular, you can barely buy one unless you\u2019re prepared to wait, wait, wait or pay a pretty premium over the list price on the secondary market.\n\nWatches falling into this category include any sports Rolex, AP\u2019s Royal Oak and Offshore models, Patek\u2019s Nautilus and Aquanaut offerings, and any item carrying Richard Mille\u2019s upper-case logo. Meaning the most fashionable watches of the day are those you can\u2019t get.\n\nErik Madigan Heck Trunk Archive / Snapper images\n\nThis doesn\u2019t quite mean they\u2019re barely in evidence. Rolex, for one, is selling more watches than any brand, period. It's just that Chinese appetite and trader-mania mean the watches never make it into Rolex boutique windows. Audemars Piguet recently changed its model to sell only through its own boutiques after so few of its timepieces became available to official AP retailers.\n\nRichard Mille is so sure of selling everything it constructs that, like AP, it has pulled out of exhibiting at watch fairs and withdrawn from selling in Australia altogether. As such, window shopping has been replaced by wrist envy.\n\nRather than despair, this is in fact fabulous news for watch lovers. While the chosen brands finesse things to incredible degrees and concentrate on filling orders, those facing more of a struggle to maintain market share have had to lift their creative game. And this means greater choice when it comes to putting something less predictable on your wrist.\n\nIt is happening across all price points, as a glance at the latest catalogues show: Seiko and Oris have their dancing shoes on, while high-end brands H. Moser & Cie and Jaquet Droz are emerging as belles of the ball.\n\nDroz was a stand-out at the Swatch Group\u2019s 2019 product reveal for its top marques in Switzerland. The world\u2019s watch press was in consensus about that, even when measured against competition like Breguet, Blancpain and Omega. Buying a Jaquet Droz will require the small effort of a trip to Melbourne if you\u2019re not domiciled there, given the brand has no other outlets in Australia, but the reward of something distinctive awaits. A disproportionally large seconds hand is the brand\u2019s schtick, and this surprisingly elegant feature distinguishes a range of models \u2013 from three-handers, chronographs and dual timers to exotic creations such as a miniature enamelled chiming bird repeater.\n\nJaquet Droz Grande Seconde Skelete soldier is for those that love all things mechanical. Supplied\n\nBut if you simply love all things mechanical it\u2019s the Grande Seconde Skelet-One Ceramic you\u2019ll want on your wrist, it being the kind of watch that holds your attention whether you\u2019re looking for the time or simply looking to pass it. As for credentials \u2013 its looks are enough to win admiring glances \u2013 they\u2019re impeccable. The 41.5mm case is in black ceramic, the exposed, black-coated self-winding movement has a white-gold oscillating weight that powers up two barrels with 68 hours in reserve, there\u2019s a fancy silicon balance spring and \u2013 well, just look at it.\n\nDoes that mean you can forget about that Rolex Submariner or GMT-Master? Not quite. You\u2019re not going to wear the Jaquet Droz every day \u2013 it\u2019s more like a McLaren compared with a Mercedes-AMG. Meaning the best bet might be to order the Rolex, but buy the Droz to take your mind off the wait.\n\nThe September issue of AFR Magazine is out on Friday, August 30 inside The Australian Financial Review.
