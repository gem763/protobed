Sign up here.\n\nChinese firms have been snapping up U.S. soybeans this week, but don\u2019t mistake this as a sign of buyer confidence in upcoming trade talks.\n\nThe companies, which received a fresh 2 million-ton quota from Beijing to import American beans free of retaliatory tariffs, have been seeking soy every day so far. That\u2019s likely because they want to rush through orders in case the talks fail and imports are halted, said Darin Friedrichs, a senior analyst at INTL FCStone\u2019s Asia commodities division.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese soybean purchases are a necessity and may be a sign that the crushers want to get these grades in quickly because things could change on talks,\u201d Friedrichs said.\n\nThe wariness of commodity traders is perhaps understandable given the whipsawing in relations between President Donald Trump and counterpart Xi Jinping over the past year.\n\nChinese firms were issued tariff waivers in July as Beijing offered Washington an olive branch, only to see shipments stopped about a month later after talks fell apart. Top negotiators from the two countries are expected to meet in Washington on Oct. 10.\n\nThe purchases may also be because it makes financial sense right now. Margins on crushing U.S. soybeans in China are higher than those of rival Brazil thanks to the lower prices of American soy when retaliatory tariffs are removed.\n\nChinese state-owned and private firms bought at least 6 cargoes of U.S. soy, equivalent to about 400,000 tons, said people familiar with the purchases, asking not to be identified because the information is private. That\u2019s on top of 12 to 15 cargoes, or 1 million tons, purchased earlier this week.\n\nNo one answered calls to China\u2019s commerce ministry during the National Day holiday, and a fax seeking comment wasn\u2019t immediately responded to.\n\nNovember soybean futures were up 0.3% at $9.16 a bushel by 9:05 a.m. in Chicago. Prices have gained 3.7% so far this week.\n\n--With assistance from Tatiana Freitas.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alfred Cang in Singapore at acang@bloomberg.net;Isis Almeida in Chicago at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Alexander Kwiatkowski at akwiatkowsk2@bloomberg.net, Anna Kitanaka, James Poole\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.
