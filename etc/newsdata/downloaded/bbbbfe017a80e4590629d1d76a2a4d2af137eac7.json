Delegates were asked to take their seats three times \u2013 only for the alert to be lifted and the crowd permitted to relax. It turned out the president had made a last-minute change to his timetable, and paid a visit to the climate change summit after all.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump had seemed taken aback when asked whether he was snubbing the world and its concerns about the climate emergency.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a snub at all. I\u2019m very busy,\u201d he said, mentioning he had been briefed on floods in Texas. \u201cThe floods are very important to me, and, uh, climate change \u2013 everything is very important.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s surprise appearance at the climate summit coincided with a speech by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. As the Indian leader spoke, Trump leaned forward in his seat as if listening intently \u2013 but it was unclear if was wearing any form of device to hear the translation.\n\nHe stayed to hear Angela Merkel, but left when it was the turn of the Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era. He completely missed Greta Thunberg\u2019s accusation that the world\u2019s leaders \u201care failing us\u201d.\n\nGreta Thunberg condemns world leaders in emotional speech at UN Read more\n\nHis arrival at the religious freedom meeting was heralded by a scratchy recording of trumpets, possibly playing Hail to the Chief, and he walked in accompanied by the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and his new ambassador to the UN, Kelly Craft.\n\nThey took their positions on the speaker\u2019s dais, and a silence quickly descended. And it continued. For about a minute. Trump drummed his fingers together. It eventually became apparent that no one was sure who would speak first.\n\nIn the end, it was Craft who took the plunge. Either she had forgotten she was supposed to be the host or she had been supposed to have been introduced by somebody else who had failed to show up.\n\nShe quickly recovered her momentum, however, demonstrating the qualities, apart from being a major Republican donor, had appealed to the president when he picked a foreign policy neophyte to represent the US at the cockpit of the international community.\n\nHer speech was a paean to Trump.\n\nAmid \u201cthe chill of a world that seems increasingly disinterested in defending the rights of all people to exercise their sincerely held religious beliefs\u201d the ambassador said a new champion had emerged.\n\n\u201cUnder his guidance, the state department has become a watchful defender of religious liberties,\u201d she said. Trump had, after all, chosen Mike Pence, who Craft said was \u201can unpretentious man, who not only believes in the power of religion. He lives his religion.\u201d\n\nThe ascendancy of this committed evangelical Christian to the No 2 spot was itself \u201ca first-class demonstration of President Trump\u2019s wisdom in selecting those who serve him closest\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s introduction drew a standing ovation from the crowd.\n\nTrump generally stuck to his prepared text about religious persecution, with ad libs, only to express his disbelief that he was the first US president to come to the UN to speak up for religious liberty.\n\nHe ended with an appeal to all governments \u201cto honour the eternal right of every person to follow their conscience, live by their faith, and give glory to God\u201d, and then handed over to Guterres.\n\nBy this time, Guterres, having been obliged to leave the climate summit he had spent a year planning to find himself in the midst of a political rally, was leaning as far away from Trump as his seat would allow.\n\nChina footage reveals hundreds of blindfolded and shackled prisoners Read more\n\nThe secretary general listed his own efforts on behalf of freedom of faith and talked about the hotspots around the world where that freedom is under threat.\n\nBut here was another way in his Guterres\u2019s speech resembled Trump\u2019s. In their litany, neither man mentioned China, which is currently detaining more than a million Uighur Muslims.\n\nAs the Trump administration has put less emphasis on the UN, Chinese influence has flourished. Beijing had not sent a representative to conference room 3, but its presence was keenly felt.", "description": "The president didn\u2019t stay for Greta Thunberg\u2019s climate speech, preferring the applause of US religious groups at a rival panel", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3eefeb58b9c818a22b59510709d66b380b4970/0_219_6566_3940/master/6566.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7b17ef055f0371f0e4209d029150c33c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
