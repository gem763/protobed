We all make mistakes and do silly things, he\u2019s just human. He\u2019s given that job all he can and he got Australia out of a difficult situation and got them to a World Cup final in 2015 and I\u2019m sure he will rise again as a coach.\u201d\n\nJones also avoided questions about whether he would consider a return Australia to take over the Wallabies coaching job. He was in charge of their team when they lost the 2003 World Cup final to England in Australia.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think that\u2019s really a question for today \u2013 I\u2019m only really worried about a pretty important game,\u201d said Jones in reference to England\u2019s Rugby World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Yokohama on Saturday.", "description": "England head coach Eddie Jones believes outgoing Wallabies coach Michael Cheika will bounce back despite his recent resignation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9515/08693fc6d70a457eb9bef8354b021d4e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
