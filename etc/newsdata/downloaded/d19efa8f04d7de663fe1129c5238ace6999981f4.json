It might be when Frank Lampard asks about old games they played in.\n\nThe Spanish international is now very much \u201ca veteran\u201d, a senior figure, and that\u2019s something that can be difficult to get your head around when you\u2019re also someone who for so long made his name as - and still youthfully looks like - an archetypal academy product.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s strange!\u201d the 32-year-old laughs. \u201cTime passes for every player. I lived a Barcelona era as a young player. Here, I\u2019ve been one of the more experienced players. I\u2019ve now spent nearly 11 years at the top level.

Almost certain to 'make it' with the Blues Reuters 30/30 Alvaro Morata -100 /10 All but gone with Atletico structuring the deal with an initial loan to push the payment back EPA\n\nBack in 2009, he and Sergio Busquets were abruptly promoted by Pep Guardiola from the Barcelona B team and Spain\u2019s third tier. It may have been to a treble-winning side that already worked so well, but that only increased the demands, the requirement to instantly adapt.\n\nAnd it was quite a culture shock. Pedro can recognise the same reactions he went through then in the faces of his young teammates now.\n\nWhat most hit him was the stadiums. All of his football had previously been played in grounds where you could always see the open Spanish sky. Suddenly, every time he looked up, he would see cavernous stands filled with people. It was even more pronounced a leap than that which Chelsea\u2019s Championship loanees like Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori have made, which is one reason why they\u2019ve asked him so much.\n\n\u201cYou go from playing against lads of your age and your level to playing with big stars,\u201d Pedro says, sitting in an interview room at Chelsea\u2019s Cobham training ground. \u201cAnd you go from stadiums where 4,000 people are watching to stadiums with 70,000, 80,000; matches with a lot of demands, that the whole world watches. People start to recognise you, so you have more responsibility.\n\n\u201cEverything changes when you go up. The rhythm of the ball changes, the competition. It\u2019s more difficult to score goals. This is the elite.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anyone. You\u2019re a bit more timid. You want to listen and learn. I was lucky because players who had a lot of experience like [Carlos] Puyol, [Victor] Valdes, Xavi helped me a lot. I learned a lot from them. That was an opportunity I had.\n\n\u201cBut this is one of the nicer aspects for a young player, when you start to have greater motivations, and a hunger to be in the team for many years and succeed.\n\n\u201cI see it with Mason, with Tammy, with Tomori, and other players from the academy that haven\u2019t come through yet. They want to learn, they\u2019re driven. Frank is a manager who gives a lot of chances to young players. It\u2019s an opportunity they shouldn\u2019t let pass.\u201d\n\nYou can tell Pedro has come from the ultimate academy club in Barcelona for reasons beyond such references. It\u2019s his entire outlook on the game, and the message he has for such young players. For him, it\u2019s not about what you can get from football. It\u2019s that all that will follow when you\u2019re prepared to give everything.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s above anything about the will to do well,\u201d Pedro tells young players. \u201cIt\u2019s about every-day education, and the desire to get better, to show they should be in the first team and keep doing it there for many years\u2026 to show every day you belong here. If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s impossible for a young player to get to the level of Frank Lampard or John Terry. That\u2019s the key, the will to show your qualities every day and to stay here many years and show you belong. It\u2019s not just about \u2018want\u2019. Many players \u2018want\u2019. It\u2019s about showing it.\u201d\n\nThe presence of a mindset like Pedro\u2019s is all the more important given this very will is what Chelsea have lacked in the Roman Abramovich era. The owner has so desperately wanted to bring academy players through and emulate Barcelona, but the demands he has placed on the team have inadvertently ensured they have done almost everything to prevent this, because the patience required for youth hasn\u2019t been possible.\n\nThat change has now been forced upon them by the transfer ban, so it helps that drastic leap all the more when you have a senior player so well versed in this process. Pedro himself feels a manager like Lampard helps.\n\n\u201cBarcelona have done it for many years, so here they have to mark out that philosophy a bit more. I think Chelsea are now working it well, with players of a high level who I think will just get better over the season.\n\n\u201cFrank knows the club, has lived so many eras and so many emotions here. He knows the identity, and looks to transmit its values.\u201d\n\nOne of Lampard\u2019s more modern values is highly co-ordinated attacking football. This is something else that has drastically changed in the game in the time since Pedro first played for Barcelona. He was, however, part of the team who first started that change.\n\nIt is why Guardiola\u2019s Barca - who Pedro still believes were the \u201cbest ever\u201d team - were also one of the most influential. Before them, even in the mid-2000s, attacking football was remarkably free-form. Pressing was basic. Individualism reigned. Since then, the level of co-ordinating in both pressing and movement has become ever more intense, to the point players almost have to study it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something all the most prominent managers now practice,\u201d Pedro explains. \u201cI believe it has to be perfected and trained on every day, because in the end you have to be able to execute a series of movements that must be co-ordinated between many players. Without it, there can be a lot of complications at the trigger moment to press. You leave space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what takes more time to get. That\u2019s what takes more work. You have to perfect it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what young players have to realise, too. And that\u2019s why every manager now has to have good communication skills. Pedro believes that this, after the initial understanding of football, is the most important element of coaching.\n\n\u201cA manager can have a great idea but if the players don\u2019t understand it, or don\u2019t follow you, your idea doesn\u2019t have much use. On the other side, you can have a bad idea, but if the players are convinced it, and you transmit it well, it can work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the fundamental. If the manager can\u2019t transmit his ideas, and the players don\u2019t understand it, you\u2019ve a problem. When your players can follow it, though, you\u2019ve already won a lot in a season.\u201d\n\nFor all that, Pedro himself represents an irony in this, given that one of his most marked qualities is something that can\u2019t really be taught. It can only be honed. It is that scoring instinct, that \u201cnose\u201d for goal.\n\n\u201cIt is something that comes from within,\u201d he admits.\n\n\u201cI think it does depend on the player and the situation. But it\u2019s about following the play, knowing where the ball is going to fall.\n\n\u201cA great manager can show you how to find goals, but it\u2019s evidently something you have to have; a drive to score.\n\n\u201cI had it with Pep, and a practical example now is with [Raheem] Sterling. He was a player who didn\u2019t score many goals and now he\u2019s a great scorer, because Guardiola was behind him, indicating the movements to get inside, rather than being outside like he was earlier. I say this because I know it well. I know those types of movements, how they work and come off. Sterling is now without doubt a player who scores goals, who makes the difference. I think that\u2019s a little bit the hand of Pep.\u201d\n\nHe points to what might be the classic Pedro goal, and one of his biggest: the opener in the Champions League final against Manchester United in 2011. It brought so much of this together, combining his individual instinct with supremely co-ordinated collective play.\n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s first of all my movement inside where I see I can draw the defence with a run. That opens space outside, where we had players like Xavi or Andres [Iniesta] who can give you those passes. You then find yourself alone in front of the goalkeeper, and then it\u2019s all about the finish. It\u2019s true it was maybe my most typical play at Barca, because I was constantly moving in these spaces, and they gave me great passes.\n\n\u201cThat was always the way at Barcelona. You simply make the movement, there\u2019s the ball, and you\u2019re one on one. Like I said earlier, though, you have to have the characteristics then to score goals.\u201d\n\nPedro says this has also been a theme of Chelsea training, not least because Lampard had that same instinct for goal as a player.\n\n\u201cHe always says to us we have to try and get into the box quickly. He was a great scorer in this league, who got a lot of goals from arriving late in the box, and a magnificent shot from outside the area. That\u2019s a little bit what I\u2019m saying about the idea he wants to transmit, and a little what I think has come up in the last few games. The season has only started but we have to try and get our concepts of play right now, so we can compete in the intense months coming up.\u201d\n\nPedro knows this too well, from so many intense years. That\u2019s not strange to him. It\u2019s all too natural, and now all about making it the same for his young teammates.", "description": "For Pedro, there are moments when it hits him.
