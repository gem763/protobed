Gay had made four previous field goals but had missed two extra points, one of which was blocked.\n\nJones completed 23 of 36 passes for 336 yards and two touchdowns, plus two scores on the ground. He was 5 of 7 on the go-ahead drive that covered 75 yards and ended with his 7-yard rushing score with 1:16 remaining to put the Giants up for the first time all day. Jones was the team\u2019s leading rusher with 28 yards.\n\nBarkley, who hurt his ankle in the second quarter when tackled awkwardly by safety Mike Edwards, had to be helped off the field. The running back \u2014 who had eight carries for 10 yards \u2014 was later seen on the sidelines with a walking boot and using crutches.\n\nChiefs 33, Ravens 28\n\nPatrick Mahomes passed for 374 yards and three touchdowns as Kansas City won its home opener by outlasting Baltimore.\n\nThe 300-yard passing performance was the 13th for Mahomes in 20 career starts. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson completed 22 of 43 passes for 267 yards and rushed for a 9-yard touchdown with 2:01 remaining, but his two-point rush failed.\n\nA 14-yard pass to LeSean McCoy with 2:07 left in the third quarter resulted in the Chiefs\u2019 last touchdown as Mahomes went 27 of 37.

Brees is expected to miss another five weeks or more with a thumb injury.\n\nSony Michel and Rex Burkhead had rushing touchdowns for the Patriots, who threatened an NFL record for fewest points allowed in the first three games of the season before Jamal Adams intercepted a Jarrett Stidham pass and went 61 yards for a touchdown with 6:23 remaining.\n\nCowboys 31, Dolphins 6\n\nDak Prescott passed for 246 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a third TD as Dallas rolled past hapless Miami in Arlington, Texas and remained undefeated.\n\nBoth of Prescott\u2019s scoring passes went to Amari Cooper, who led the Cowboys with six catches for 88 yards. Ezekiel Elliott ran for 125 yards on 19 carries, and Tony Pollard added 103 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries as Dallas recorded its first back-to-back games with 200 yards rushing since 2009.\n\nJosh Rosen, who was acquired in the offseason after starting 13 games last season for Arizona, started for the first time for the Dolphins and passed for 200 yards.

Denver\u2019s Joe Flacco threw for 213 yards but tossed one interception and was sacked six times.\n\nThe Broncos controlled the ball for more than 35 minutes and ran 21 more plays. Six of their first nine possessions reached Green Bay\u2019s side of the field. Their final possession in Green Bay territory came late in the fourth quarter, with Denver trailing by 11. The Packers got a turnover on downs when outside linebacker Preston Smith made his third sack of the game.\n\nColts 27, Falcons 24\n\nJacoby Brissett threw for 310 yards as host Indianapolis earned its second straight win, holding off Atlanta.\n\nBrissett completed 28 of 37 passes, including an 11-yard strike to Jack Doyle in the final two minutes for a first down to the Atlanta 16 that sealed the outcome. The Colts also got 74 yards and a touchdown on 16 carries from Marlon Mack, who provided the Colts\u2019 final score, running 4 yards with 8:40 left to lead 27-17.\n\nThe Falcons drew back within a field goal on Matt Ryan\u2019s 10-yard touchdown pass to Julio Jones with 4:11 left, but never saw the ball again.\n\nLions 27, Eagles 24\n\nMatthew Stafford completed 18 of 32 passes for 201 yards and one touchdown, and Detroit remained unbeaten with a victory at Philadelphia.\n\nWide receiver Marvin Jones Jr. had six receptions for 101 yards and one touchdown as the Lions improved to 2-0-1. Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz was 19 of 36 for 259 yards and two touchdowns to Nelson Agholor, but Philadelphia fell to 1-2.\n\nThe Eagles had one last chance to win when Malcolm Jenkins blocked a 46-yard field-goal attempt by Matt Prater just inside the two-minute warning. Wentz connected with running back Darren Sproles on fourth-and-5 for a 25-yard strike to get to the Lions\u2019 20, but Sproles was called for pass interference to negate the play.\n\nTexans 27, Chargers 20\n\nDeshaun Watson connected with tight end Jordan Akins for two second-half touchdowns to lead Houston to a come-from-behind victory over Los Angeles on Sunday at Carson, Calif.\n\nWatson escaped the grasp of Melvin Ingram and hit Akins for a 53-yard scoring play with 9:40 left in the fourth quarter to make it 27-17. The Texans missed the PAT.\n\nThe Chargers had appeared to stop the Texans\u2019 drive five plays earlier on Rayshawn Jenkins\u2019 interception, but the turnover was nullified by offsetting penalties, including a facemask infraction on Desmond King. Los Angeles\u2019 14-play, 60-yard drive in the final minutes ended when Philip Rivers\u2019 fourth-and-14 pass fell incomplete.\n\nVikings 34, Raiders 14\n\nMinnesota got rushing touchdowns from three different players and totaled 211 yards on the ground in bulldozing visiting Oakland in Minneapolis.\n\nAdam Thielen scored twice, once on a pass from Kirk Cousins, and the Vikings\u2019 defense harassed Derek Carr into four sacks and an interception in the most lopsided game in 38 years in the 16-game all-time series between the Super Bowl XI combatants.\n\nDalvin Cook rushed for 110 yards and a second-quarter touchdown, and also caught four passes for 33 yards. He went over 100 yards rushing for the third straight game, a feat last accomplished by a Viking when Adrian Peterson did it in 2015.\n\n49ers 24, Steelers 20\n\nJimmy Garoppolo\u2019s 5-yard touchdown pass to Dante Pettis with 1:15 left boosted the error-prone San Francisco to a 3-0 start as it rallied past winless Pittsburgh in Santa Clara, Calif.\n\nGaroppolo completed 23 of 32 passes for 277 yards with two interceptions. The Niners won despite making five turnovers and committing 71 yards worth of penalties.\n\nSteelers quarterback Mason Rudolph hit on 14 of 27 passes for 174 yards and two touchdowns, including a 39-yarder to rookie Diontae Johnson with 10:22 left in the game for a 20-17 edge. But Pittsburgh (0-3) was outgained 436-239 on the day.\n\nSaints 33, Seahawks 27\n\nTeddy Bridgewater threw two touchdown passes in his first start in place of Drew Brees as New Orleans won at Seattle.\n\nBridgewater was making his second NFL start since the 2015 season as he fills in for Brees. The former Pro Bowl quarterback completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards. He hit running back Alvin Kamara on a 29-yard touchdown late in the second quarter and wide receiver Michael Thomas from 1 yard out in the third.\n\nThe Saints\u2019 defense and special teams each contributed a touchdown as New Orleans improved to 2-1. It was just the third time in Saints history that the team scored a touchdown in all three phases in the same game.\n\nPanthers 38, Cardinals 20\n\nKyle Allen threw two of his four touchdown passes to tight end Greg Olsen as Carolina notched its first victory by defeating host Arizona at Glendale, Ariz.\n\nAllen, who made his first start of the season and second of his career, was filling in for injured Cam Newton (foot). For Allen, who is from Arizona, it was a happy homecoming as he completed 19 of 26 passes for 261 yards.\n\nFor Arizona quarterback Kyler Murray and first-year coach Kliff Kingsbury, they\u2019ll have to wait to produce their first NFL victory. The Cardinals are 0-2-1. Murray finished 30-for-43 passing for 173 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, taking eight sacks.\n\nBills 21, Bengals 17\n\nFrank Gore scored on a 1-yard run with 1:50 remaining to give Buffalo a victory over visiting Cincinnati in its home opener.\n\nAfter Gore\u2019s touchdown, the Bengals mounted a drive in the final minute to Buffalo\u2019s 28-yard line, but Tre\u2019Davious White intercepted a pass by Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton at the 10-yard line to end the game. Buffalo is 3-0 for the first time since 2008.\n\nGore rushed for a team-high 76 yards on 14 carries. Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 23 of 36 passes for 243 yards, with a touchdown and interception.
