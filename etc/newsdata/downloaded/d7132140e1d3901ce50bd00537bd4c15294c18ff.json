He has also secured a $500million credit line from banks using company stock as collateral.\n\nNeumann and wife Rebekah Paltrow Neumann attend the 2018 Time 100 Gala at Jazz at Lincoln Center on April 24, 2018 in New York City\n\nNeumann's exit from the board of WeWork's parent company, The We Company, would represent a dramatic fall from grace, given Wall Street's expectations earlier this year that he would lead one of corporate America's most hotly anticipated stock market debuts. Neumann is pictured at the 2018 Time 100 Gala\n\nThe We Company's board will meet on Tuesday to evaluate SoftBank's offer against an alternative financing proposal from JPMorgan Chase & Co, sources said.\n\nJPMorgan faces challenges in putting together a debt package for WeWork, because it has not underwritten it and is trying to find banks and institutional investors to back it, the insiders added.\n\nSoftBank has offered $5billion in new money to WeWork in the form of debt, the sources said. It is also proposing to accelerate a previous $1.5billion equity commitment to WeWork in the form of warrants that are due in April, the sources said.\n\nThis commitment was made in January at a $47billion valuation, but SoftBank is now seeking to renegotiate it at a valuation of about $8billion, the sources added.\n\nSoftBank is also proposing to launch a tender offer for up to $3billion to acquire WeWork shares from existing investors and insiders, including Neumann, the sources said.\n\nBased on the outcome of the tender offer, SoftBank could own between 60 percent and 80 percent of WeWork but will seek to avoid consolidating the company on its books, one of the sources added.\n\nSoftBank and its $100billion Vision Fund already own about a third of WeWork through previous investments totaling $10.6billion.\n\nNeumann could step down from The We Company's board as part of the deal with SoftBank and become an adviser, according to the sources.\n\nSoftBank Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure would succeed Neumann as chairman, the sources said.\n\nSoftbank's nearly $10million offer was a far cry from the $47billion valuation WeWork received from the former firm in a funding round in January (file photo)\n\nWeWork, SoftBank and JPMorgan declined to comment when approached by Reuters on Monday. A spokeswoman for Neumann also declined to comment.\n\nSoftBank has lined up Mizuho Financial Group Inc as part of its syndication of the $5billion debt package, one of the sources said.\n\nThe package comprises letters of credit for more than $1billion, as well as senior secured and subordinated bonds, the source added.\n\nMizuho declined to comment.\n\nThe We Company\u00b4s seven-member board tasked two directors with representing the interests of all investors in the company by sitting on the special committee considering the financing plans.\n\nOne is Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital. The other is Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach.\n\nArtie Minson, previously WeWork's chief financial officer, and Sebastian Gunningham, who was a vice chairman at the company, are now serving as its co-chief executives.\n\nFacing a cash crunch, WeWork is seeking to slow down its expansion, reducing the number of new property leases it is taking on.\n\nThe We Company's board has also agreed on a cost-cutting plan that includes layoffs. The cuts will occur over the coming weeks, the sources added.", "description": "A source familiar with the negotiations said WeWork founder Adam Neumann would see the massive payout if he agrees to step aside under Softbank's $10million offer to take over the company.", "authors": ["Keith Griffith", "Megan Sheets For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/07/20022544-0-image-a-24_1571725652915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
