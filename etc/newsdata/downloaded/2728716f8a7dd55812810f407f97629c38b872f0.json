The 48% increase from the same month last year was largely driven by tariffs implemented by the Trump administration, the group said, which accounted for $3.4 billion.\n\nThat figure was slightly lower than the one reported by the government. In its latest budget statement, the Treasury Department said the US collected roughly $7 billion in customs duties that month.\n\nDan Anthony, the vice president of the Trade Partnership, said tariff figures could vary because they are recorded by multiple departments and subject to revisions.\n\n\"The Tariff Tracker uses Census' calculated duties data because they are the only publicly available figures that contain the necessary product and country details for analyzing sector trends, state breakdowns, etc.,\" Anthony said.\n\nTariff collections are expected to increase in the coming months as the Trump administration pressures China to change trade practices perceived as unfair. The two sides are expected to increase the tariff rates on thousands of products on October 15.\n\nNow read: Dyslexic, failing at school, and partially blind: How Larry Hite overcame the odds to become one of the most successful self-made stock traders using a strategy that's 'accessible to anybody'", "description": "Americans shelled out tens of billions of dollars in tariffs over the past year and a half.\u00a0 Businesses and consumers in the US have paid an addition...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/56fd638552bcd0210c8b9fe1-1024/gettyimages-518262884.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
