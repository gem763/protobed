When traditional medicine failed, she found CBD (cannabis without the THC, in case you have missed the beauty trend of the year). And while many are skeptical of the trend, it\u2019s a pretty convincing endorsement that it helped a woman feel better postpartum \u2014 so much better that Margaryan decided to start her own luxe CBD brand, Pellequr. Kim Kardashian West and Kourtney Kardashian are fans.\n\nIn addition to making CBD oil and salves, staples in the CBD marketplace, Pellequr makes a range of CBD bath bombs which have 60 mg of CBD to send you deeper into relaxation. The CBD in Pellequr is the most expensive on the market, and offers 1,000 mg in the tincture bottle. As a result, the peppermint CBD oil costs $100. Now, the full range is available at Bergdorf Goodman, the first store to stock Pellequr. Shop the range below.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "description": "Pellequr CBD makes bath bombs, tinctures, and CBD salves that Kim Kardashian West is \u201cobsessed with.\u201d", "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/08/30/Pellequr-Products0462.w1200.h630.jpg"}
