While in Asia I had an opportunity to visit Cambodia. I was taken to one of the \u201ckilling fields\u201d near Phnom Penh, with its glass pagoda of trays and trays of human skulls \u2014 adults and children. That visit was soul-searing!\n\nIt was therefore beyond appalling to me to see those horrific images used on a supposed \u201cpolitical ad\u201d on ABC during the Democratic debate Thursday night. ABC \u2014 until now \u2014 has been my channel of choice for the nightly news. I cannot understand how this organization would allow such an offensive ad by a political action committee \u2014 regardless of how much was paid for it or which party it was supposed to represent.\n\nIs this what we can expect now for the remainder of this endless pre-election period? What have we come to as a nation that this can be considered acceptable?", "description": "A Catholic nun is shocked that ABC would run an ad with \u201chorrific images\u201d during the Democratic debate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/13debate-ad/13debate-ad-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
