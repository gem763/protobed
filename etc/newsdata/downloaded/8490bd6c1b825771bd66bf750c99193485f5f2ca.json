Although additional funding is welcome news to fusion researchers like me, it isn\u2019t an effective response to climate change.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why such a pledge is appealing though. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars like our sun. Unlike current nuclear power plants \u2013 which split atoms in a process called fission \u2013 nuclear fusion binds atomic nuclei together. This releases much more energy than fission and produces no high-level nuclear waste.\n\nA fusion reactor would also produce zero carbon emissions and wouldn\u2019t run the risk of a nuclear meltdown. Fusion could produce energy regardless of wind conditions or daylight hours, and wouldn\u2019t require enriched uranium, which can be repurposed for nuclear weapons.\n\nAs good as this all sounds, nuclear fusion is unlikely to play a major role in fighting climate change. To understand why, we need only look at the current state of fusion research.\n\nFusion: for the stars, for now\n\nFor decades, the performance of fusion devices has been improving \u2013 the capacity of scientists to confine hot hydrogen plasma has improved by a factor of 10,000. This plasma has to be over 100,000,000\u00b0C in order for the hydrogen nuclei to fuse and generate energy.\n\nThe next big step is ITER, a huge project involving 35 nations, under construction in the south of France. ITER\u2019s purpose is to test our ability to confine plasma for long enough and at a high enough density and temperature. Its goal is to be the first fusion device to produce more energy from the plasma than is put into it.\n\nBut ITER isn\u2019t a power station, it\u2019s an experiment. The plan is to build a demonstration fusion power plant \u2013 called \u201cDEMO\u201d \u2013 after ITER shows it\u2019s possible for the plasma to generate a net gain in energy. But ITER isn\u2019t likely to reach this goal until 2035.\n\nThe EU fusion roadmap assumes DEMO comes some time afterwards, likely around 2050 or later. The Tory promise of 2040 is extremely optimistic. A DEMO power plant needs to solve several problems which ITER won\u2019t address. ITER\u2019s power is produced in the form of neutrons which hit the reactor\u2019s internal walls, but DEMO needs to actually turn that power into electricity.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is that a fusion reactor has to generate some of its own fuel. Two types of hydrogen are needed \u2013 deuterium, which is abundant in seawater, and tritium, which is rare on Earth because it decays into helium with a half-life of only 12 years. DEMO will need to combine the neutrons from the plasma with lithium to produce new tritium fuel, in a process called \u201ctritium breeding\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, prototypes of this crucial technology can\u2019t even be tested until ITER starts producing copious high-energy neutrons, in 2035. The UK has a solid research plan working towards solving all of these problems, but there isn\u2019t much that can be done to accelerate this timeline.\n\nFailing leadership on climate change\n\nIn 2018, the IPCC released their 1.5\u00b0C report, which explained that the world must reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to limit future warming to 1.5\u00b0C. It\u2019s unlikely that commercial fusion power plants will exist in time for that, and even once a first-of-its-kind DEMO power plant is operational, hundreds would still need to be built to seriously dent global emissions. None of this sits well with the 2040 date the Conservatives have promised.\n\nEven if a new green energy technology like fusion is realized before 2050, that\u2019s far too late for the 1.5\u00b0C target anyway. \u201cNet-zero by 2050\u201d assumes that emissions have been constantly decreasing from now until 2050. As it\u2019s the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that sets the level of eventual global warming, it\u2019s cumulative emissions that matter.\n\nEven if we could snap our fingers on December 31, 2049 and replace all fossil fuel plants, the world would have already emitted twice as much carbon as the budget allows. Sound climate policy involves cutting emissions as soon as possible, and any further delay makes the task even harder.\n\nThe Conservatives scrapped subsidies for domestic solar panel installation in April 2019.

But the climate won\u2019t wait for us if we trip up.\n\nAny convincing climate policy requires huge investments across many sectors, from domestic heating to road transport to agriculture. Even a complete decarbonization of the electricity grid is only one part of the solution. The Committee on Climate Change\u2019s net-zero report laid this all out starkly for policymakers \u2013 only mentioning nuclear fusion once in 227 pages. The idea of a single panacea is simplistic fantasy.\n\nSo why fund fusion?\n\nThe likely role for fusion would be as an energy source in a post-carbon society. It\u2019s well worth funding it for that reason alone, and it\u2019s possible that an unexpected breakthrough will ensure it can reduce emissions after all. In fact, research into all sorts of new technologies could help make reducing emissions easier, such as industrial carbon capture and storage.\n\nThe allure of fusion makes it a good distraction from the failures of the current government\u2019s science and climate policy. The Committee on Climate Change has set 25 targets that need to be met to ensure the UK is a net-zero society by 2050. The government is currently only on track to meet one of them.\n\nThis funding is also of little consolation to laboratories who are worried about the impact of Brexit on UK science, and their international staff who rely on freedom of movement. In fact, the government has yet to commit to paying to participate in the EU DEMO program in the case of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nClimate policy should prioritize deploying proven technologies immediately, without relying on speculative solutions. Stopping climate change is too important to leave to the last minute.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation by Thomas Nicholas, PhD candidate in Plasma Science and Fusion Energy, University of York under a Creative Commons license.
