They then accumulated all of the moves in fed funds futures following tweets in each category to obtain the overall impact on the market's monetary policy expectations.\n\nThe Fed funds futures market is where traders bet on where the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate will land. Policymakers watch for changes in how markets view where interest rates are heading.\n\nGoldman found that Trump's tweets on trade, on which he has been vociferous amid an ongoing trade and tariff dispute with China, impacted the Fed funds futures market much more than those criticizing the Fed.\n\n\"The market moves are much larger, statistically highly significant, and more clearly skewed to the downside, ranging from -14 basis points (bp) to +4bp. Cumulatively, the impact on market expectations for the funds rate is about -40bp when we include tweets indicating escalation of trade tensions and tweets indicating de-escalation, and about -60bp when we focus only on tweets indicating escalation.\"\n\n\"Once again, there are many tweets that garner little reaction, but there are also quite a few trade policy tweets that lead to sizable swings. This is intuitive, as there are clear channels through which tariff escalation can lead to a dimmer economic outlook,\" Goldman said.\n\nGoldman Sachs' analysts interpreted the findings as showing \"that markets believe the President primarily affects Fed policy indirectly by influencing the macroeconomic outlook, with at most a limited perceived role for tweets about the Fed.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump's tweets on trade have much more of an impact on the market's expectations for Federal Reserve monetary policy than his tweets directly criticizing the central bank, Goldman Sachs said.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106169466-1570524192624gettyimages-1173692175.jpeg?v=1570524215", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
