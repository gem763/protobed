In one video, which the sheriff\u2019s department shared to Twitter, Dhaliwal can be seen letting a young boy lock him in handcuffs. In another, he can be seen collecting supplies for victims of Hurricane Harvey.\n\n\u201cHe was there all day every day, loading trucks, handing out food\u2014he went above and beyond,\u201d said Gurwin Ahuja of We Are Sikhs, an organization that worked with Dhaliwal on the Harvey relief effort. \u201cHe was doing this difficult job, but he had this joyousness about him that uplifted people during a difficult time.\u201d\n\nDhaliwal was also seen as an inspiration for other Sikhs in law enforcement. He joined the force in 2009, at a tense time for the department and the Sikh community, former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe year before, a different deputy had responded to reports of a robbery at a Sikh family's home and wound up putting the entire family in handcuffs. The incident became a \u201clightning rod\u201d in the community, Garcia said. He decided to visit a Sikh temple and ask members of the community to join the force. Dhaliwal was the only one in the crowd to answer his call.\n\nYears later, when Garcia began allowing practicing Sikhs to wear their articles of faith on the job, Dhaliwal was the first officer to don a turban and full beard\u2014outward symbols of spiritual devotion in the Sikh tradition.\n\n\u201c[Dhaliwal] looked beyond himself and he said, \u2018Can you imagine what this will say to the Sikh community, to the Indian community, what it will say to the diversity of the county that you welcome anyone who wants to serve and allow us to be who we are?\u2019\u201d said Garcia, now the county police commissioner.\n\nThe department currently employs one other Sikh deputy and several more community members in civilian roles. Other departments around the country have followed. For example, in late 2016 the NYPD began allowing Sikh officers to wear a navy blue turban fastened with police brass in what the police commissioner hailed as a \u201cmajor change in our uniform policy.\u201d\n\nBut Manpreet Kaur Singh, a local attorney who helped lobby the sheriff\u2019s department form the policy change, said he never imagine Dhaliwal would die this way.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re celebrating an accommodation you never anticipate that the results of that accommodation could be that you lose your life,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nAt this point, authorities say they do not believe the killing was a hate crime.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any evidence right now to indicate that\u2019s the case,\u201d said Harris County Sheriff's spokesman Jason Spencer. \u201cOur indications are this is an individual who had an active parole violation and his motivation was not to go back to prison.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, Robert Solis, has been a wanted fugitive since 2017, when he violated parole on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, authorities said. He has previously been charged with aggravated kidnapping, aggravated robbery and driving under the influence, according to Harris County court records.\n\nAuthorities say dashboard camera footage from Dhaliwal\u2019s police vehicle shows the sheriff's deputy talking with Solis, 47, after pulling him over for running a stop sign. The conversation appeared routine, authorities said.\n\nBut when Dhaliwal turned to walk back to his patrol car, Solis got out and ran toward the deputy with a gun and shot the officer twice in the back of head. The suspect \u201cbasically just shot him in a very ruthless, cold-blooded way,\u201d Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in a press conference.\n\nColleagues responded after a passerby called 911 to report a police officer had been shot. Dhaliwal was airlifted to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nPolice also questioned a woman who was in the passenger seat during the traffic stop, authorities said in a Saturday court hearing. The woman said Solis warned her they were about to be pulled over and that he had tickets, investigators said. She said Dhaliwal allowed her to leave before the shooting occurred.", "description": "Harris County Sheriff's Office/TwitterSheriff\u2019\u2019s Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal gained national attention in 2015 when the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office allowed him to become one of first Sikhs in the country to wear a traditional turban and keep his beard long in accordance with his faith.
