Or, to be more specific, a feature that allows you to get the live word count for whatever document you\u2019re working on. It\u2019s a lot more convenient than having to click through menus to see a static word count over, and over, and over. There is, however, one important caveat.\n\nStrangely, the live word count doesn\u2019t pop up whenever you start a new document on your desktop \u2014 nor is there a way to enable it by default for every new document you start. You have to turn the feature on manually within each one, which you can do by clicking on Tools > Word Count > \u201cDisplay word count while typing.\u201d\n\nWhen you do, you\u2019ll get a little pop-up in the lower-left corner that tells you the current word count.\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nThis count is pretty accurate with one glaring bug (so far). As Android Police reports, apparently the word count feature has a 20,000-character limit right now. Go past that, and you\u2019ll be told that you\u2019ve \u201creached the limit for word count viewable while typing.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not sure if this is an actual bug or an intended feature, but it does limit the word count\u2019s usefulness if you\u2019re working on a reasonably long document. We\u2019ll report back if Google changes (or fixes) this feature at some future point.", "description": "Google has officially rolled out the most useful addition to Docs we\u2019ve seen in years: a word count.
