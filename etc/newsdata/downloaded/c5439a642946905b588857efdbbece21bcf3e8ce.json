He is expected to meet with Abe on Thursday, according to an official of Lee\u2019s office.Lee, who is fluent in Japanese, is considered in a favorable light by some experts in Japan for his previous experience as a reporter based in Tokyo and as vice chair of the Korea-Japan Parliamentary Friendship Association.Bilateral relations have been strained amid Japan\u2019s trade restrictions on exports to Korea and Japan\u2019s removal of Korea from its list of favored trading partners in August. Local experts in Korea read the moves as retaliation from Japan following the Korean Supreme Court\u2019s rulings last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Korean victims of Japanese wartime forced labor.The same month, Korea decided it would pull out of its military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, the General Security of Military Information Agreement (Gsomia), which was signed in 2016 and has since been renewed annually.\u201cIf Japan rescinds trade restrictions on Korea, then we can reconsider the decision [to pull out of Gsomia],\u201d Lee said in the interview. \u201cWith dialogue, it would not be impossible for the two nations to return to the way things were before July.\u201dLee in the interview also mentioned the forced labor issue.\u201cThe current state of things is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are behind-the-scenes talks taking place between the two countries, and I believe they can speed up with the support of both leaders.\u201dDuring the Japanese colonial period (1910-45), about 299 Japanese companies subjected hundreds of thousands of Korean workers to forced labor. The companies include Toyota, Sumitomo Metal Mining, Hitachi and Toshiba.The Supreme Court of Korea ruled last year that two Japanese companies must compensate the Korean forced laborers. The top court recognized that the Japanese government failed to acknowledge the illegality of its colonial rule and that the victims\u2019 rights to individual compensation had not expired.Tokyo protested the rulings, claiming that a 1965 treaty normalizing bilateral relations settled all compensation issues.Korea in June this year proposed a joint fund with Japan to compensate the victims together, a proposal Japan rejected.The Korean government may be willing to discuss the issue with Japan again, without putting its previous proposal forward.\u201cIf we can see a path to resolution, we will hold talks with no preconditions,\u201d Nam Gwan-pyo, Korean ambassador to Japan told the Nikkei Asian Review on Friday regarding the forced labor issue. \u201cI will put all options on the table.\u201cWe are open to all possibilities that could lead to a resolution. And if Japan has a good idea, we are willing to discuss it.\u201dKorea\u2019s Blue House kept mum on Lee\u2019s said conversation with Moon regarding the letter. \u201cThere was a conversation between the two, as you saw in Kyodo News,\u201d a Blue House official told the JoongAng Ilbo on Friday but did not give any further response when asked to confirm Moon\u2019s plan to write a letter to Abe.In response to a question about whether there is a possibility that Moon and Abe will hold a summit within the year, the official said, \u201cThere is not much we can share on any upcoming plan to hold summits with other leaders.\u201dBY YOON SEOL-YOUNG, PARK KWANG-SOO AND YONHAP [chung.juhee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/18200716.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
