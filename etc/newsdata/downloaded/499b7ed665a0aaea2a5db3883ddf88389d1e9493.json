Simply put, we do not imprison our opponents in this country. Leave that to Russia's Vladimir Putin and other despots. We don\u2019t do this whether she\u2019s a Democrat or he\u2019s a Republican. But that didn\u2019t stop some loud fans at Game 5 of the World Series from attempting to rival the president for the title of \u201cugliest American,\u201d when they chanted, \u201cLock him up!\u201d between the third and fourth innings.\n\nThe morning after, Joe Scarborough, host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d called out the crowd\u2019s behavior as \u201cjust un-American.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt started with Donald Trump. In fact, he's made it a centerpiece of his campaign rallies. \u2026 We are Americans, and we do not do that. We do not want the world hearing us chant, 'Lock him up,' to this president or to any president.\"\n\nAgreed. And I\u2019m doubling down with his co-host Mika Brzezinski, who pressed the point: \"We find it sickening when it happens at his rallies.\u201d\n\nThat chant is equally sickening when it happens during a nationally televised baseball game. We are not a rogue nation that \u201clocks up\u201d its politicians.\n\nIs it OK to heckle a president?\n\nBut yes, there\u2019s a distinction, as historian Heather Cox Richardson reminds us: \u201cPresidents get heckled; it goes with the turf. This is not the same thing as presidents heckling individuals, which carries with it the weight of the government being used against people the leaders don't like.\u201d\n\nNo sooner had Brzezinski and Scarborough finished, the debate took off on Twitter, with the co-hosts taken to the woodshed.\n\nOne Twitter user asserted: \u201cIt is a patriotic act, a right under the Constitution to free speech and assembly. It\u2019s as patriotic as chanting \u2018Lock her up\u2019 #ImpeachTrump #WeThePeople\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump attends the fifth game of the World Series on Oct. 27, 2019.

In an Instagram post, Brezinski replied: \"Remember @repcummings famous words, 'We are better than this'! #Morningjoe\"\n\nAnother set of critiques went far afield, conflating the condemnation of \u201cLock him up!\u201d with what I\u2019ll call the \u201cBonus Constitutional Amendment,\" our right to boo those with whom we disagree. Make no mistake: Booing is as American as baseball or apple pie.\n\nI'm all for civility: But what if our fellow citizens express contemptible views?\n\nFor instance, it\u2019s not unusual for presidents to be booed at baseball games. In a tweet, historian Kevin Kruse reminded us, \u201cAnd other presidents have been booed at baseball games, in case everyone suddenly forgot. If I'm remembering correctly, Obama was booed at the All-Star Game in 2009, and GWBush was booed at a Nationals game in 2008, and GHWBush was famously booed at the 1992 All-Star Game\u201d\n\n\u201cBoo\u201d all you want; it\u2019s how we voice disapproval. The civility police will not jail you for its use.\n\nVoicing their discontent through boos\n\nAnother person responded: \"Nope, nope, nope Joe. This dude and his administration have deeply damaged our constitution, world standing, the planet, our laws, women, children, our military, poor folks, middle class folks, poc, EVERYONE. He should be booed every minute of every day forever.\"\n\nThen came the busload of tweeters who ran back and forth over Brzezinski and Scarborough, devising a laundry list of mitigating circumstances why the fans were right to chant, \u201cLock him up.\u201d Many of their tweets focused on the legitimacy of the Trump presidency. They are right that Trump doesn\u2019t look like a president, doesn\u2019t talk like a president and doesn\u2019t act like a president. Yes, there\u2019s every reason \u2014 and still a few more \u2014 to question his legitimacy.\n\nStill another person tweeted: \u201cProblem is, Trump isn't a president. I mean, technically he is, but in every other regard, he isn't. He needs to be called out with any chant his opposition can come up with, as often as possible.\u201d\n\nOK, then, impeach the guy. Right, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is on that already.\n\nFinally, Twitter brought its laser-like focus to bear on me, The Civilist, and others like me.\n\nOne user said: \"Right on cue, here's the civility police, telling everyone to be nice to the man locking up kids in cages and abandoning key allies to genocide. I look forward to your similar tongue clucking about the President encouraging inevitable 'lock him/her up' chants at his next rally.\"\n\nThat tweet was liked nearly 3,000 times.\n\nA refuge for cruelty: Fight on the side of civility in America\u2019s social media civil war\n\nNo one\u2019s saying \u2014 least of all Mika, Joe or me \u2014 that Americans should be \u201cnice to the man locking up kids in cages and abandoning key allies to genocide.\u201d What I am strongly suggesting is: Don\u2019t play dirty ball like Donald Trump.\n\nCivility is a two-way street: To subvert American values as the president does nearly every day, to threaten to \u201clock her up,\u201d to seek dirt on a rival candidate from a foreign power \u2014 demands that we stand up for our democratic values of respect and due process and, should it come to it, an impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nThat\u2019s the American way.\n\nSteven Petrow is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and author of five books on etiquette.
