After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\nColeen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of selling stories about her (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nRebekah strenuously denied all claims (Picture: Getty)\n\nFans couldn\u2019t cope with the drama, with memes taking over social media and #WAGathaChristie trending on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, swiftly denied all claims, sharing her own statement on Instagram.\n\n\u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nWhile Jamie has yet to speak out over the claims, he unfollowed Wayne on Instagram and was said to be \u2018distressed\u2019 over the drama.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
