Understanding the various drivers and parameters can help gauge the next big move.\n\nFrom its August 2018 bottom at the $1,160 level, gold has been driven higher because of its safe haven status. Since May it's received an additional bounce on the outlook for lower U.S. interest rates, whose outlook for a lower dollar-yield boosted the relative value of the non-yielding commodity.\n\nYesterday\u2019s advance followed the Fed\u2019s saying the central bank may need to , to offset downside risks from trade conflicts and too-low inflation.\n\nBut gold has been climbing since Thursday, ahead of Bullard\u2019s dovish rhetoric. Beforehand, the yellow metal was trading within a holding pattern, in effect since mid-August, as investors awaited clarity regarding the Fed\u2019s path to interest rates since the recent division of opinion among policy makers reduced the chances of additional cuts, even while Fed Chair Jerome Powell continues to reiterate that the Fed is monitoring the situation while remaining ready to continue easing as needed.\n\nThe commodity's advance is particularly impressive considering it's pushing ahead despite the weight of a third straight day of U.S. dollar strengthening.\n\nBut, why would the greenback move higher, if the yellow metal\u2019s rally is a result of expectations for lower rates? That should hurt the dollar.\n\nPerhaps the USD demand is coming from overseas, where a recession is all but a forgone conclusion and near-zero or even negative rates make Treasury yields look like a bonanza.\n\nGiven the conflicting intermarket dynamic, where is gold likely to go from here?\n\nGold Daily\n\nGold\u2019s current rally has brought the commodity to its highest in nearly three weeks, while slowing it at the same time. The balance of supply and demand reveal an unresolved collective investor mindset. The commodity is still within an uptrend since the May bottom, but the aforementioned holding pattern formed a H&S reversal, whose downside breakout would signal a downtrend.\n\nHowever, the rally is shifting the price from the $1,480 neckline, the \u201cline in the sand\u201d for the trend. Still, the price slowed down by the Sept. 12 highs, as well as by the (dotted) trend line since the Aug. 13 high of the left shoulder.\n\nIn other words, this rally may simply play along the pattern\u2019s dynamics, as it creates the right shoulder for a pattern that will end the uptrend.\n\nSo how to proceed?\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders would wait for either a downside breakout of the neckline or for a new high for a continued uptrend, using a three-percent filter to avoid whipsaws and see proof of trend with respective consolidations past the breaking points mentioned.\n\nModerate traders may wait for the same breaking points as conservative traders, though while they may wait for the return move for better entries, they won\u2019t necessarily wait for support or resistance to strengthen the outlook.\n\nAggressive traders may enter a contrarian short position, taking advantage of the proximity to the resistance provided by the Sept. 12 high and that of the right shoulder.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Short Position Setup", "description": "Commodities Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: XAU/USD, US Dollar Index Futures, Gold Futures.
