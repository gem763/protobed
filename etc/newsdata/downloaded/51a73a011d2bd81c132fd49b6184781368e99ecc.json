To be fair, those announcements can be difficult to hear even when you don\u2019t have anything in your ears.\n\nThe new features collectively represent a nice leap compared to prior AirPods and are Apple\u2019s justification for the price hike. The company is keeping second-generation and original AirPods in the lineup for $199 and $159, respectively.\n\nI wear those second-gens almost daily, mainly for podcasts, and I like them a lot. But when I really want to get into music, I still frequently switch to wired Bose headphones with noise cancellation.\n\nAnd noise cancellation is the chief reason my first impressions of the AirPods Pro \u2013 yes, it's a mouthful \u2013 are favorable. But I\u2019ve only been listening to music and making calls on them for a day, and not everything in my experience so far has been perfect.\n\nFinding the proper fit\n\nLet me start by saying that I find the latest models slightly less comfortable than their predecessors \u2013 judging by some of my peers, though, that feeling puts me in the minority. On two separate occasions, one of AirPods popped out of my ears, even though I had barely moved.\n\nApple includes three different sized silicone ear tips in the box, the medium-sized ones already attached to the bud. The goal is to create a complete seal when these are in your ears, which helps with both audio quality and noise cancellation.\n\nTo help take the guesswork out of which ones may best fit, Apple has designed an Ear Tip Fit test, found in Bluetooth settings on an iPhone. You place AirPods in each ear and press play. You hear a musical snippet while algorithms working in tandem with an inward-facing microphone measure what you\u2019re hearing and compare the result to what the speaker drivers are producing.\n\nSelf-landing plane:Forget self-driving cars, this plane landed itself\n\nThe test will let you know if you have a good seal for each ear or require another size or adjustment. Since you wear these independently, it\u2019s possible that you will need a different size tip for the left or right.\n\nThe medium tips on the AirPods Pro by default passed the test in both my ears, but I chose to experiment with other sizes just the same. The tips are easy to remove and snap back on.\n\nBoth small tips formed an imperfect seal in my ears, so neither passed. On the largest size, the left one passed the ear test while the right tip failed. Oddly, I got the same result when I put the mediums back in my ears, a frustrating exercise since they initially formed a proper fit.\n\nControlling AirPods with a squeeze or your voice\n\nI have another quibble. When I used a \u201cHey, Siri\u201d command to ask Apple\u2019s assistant for the weather or to tell me what song I was listening to, its response through the AirPods came at a far lower volume than the music had been at, making it difficult to hear.\n\nYou can toggle back and forth between noise-cancellation and Transparency modes in a variety of ways: You can ask Siri to make the switch, tap controls on an iPhone in Control Center, or squeeze an indented capacitive force sensor on the stem hanging down from each AirPods Pro.\n\nSuch stems are noticeably shorter than the posts on the older AirPods.\n\nAn audible chime lets you know the change to one mode or another has been registered, assuming you can\u2019t otherwise tell the difference.\n\nYou can also squeeze the sensor on the stem a single time to play, pause or answer a call, twice to skip ahead, or three times to skip back. If you\u2019re used to the prior models where you tap instead for these functions, there\u2019s a very short learning curve.\n\nThese are also the first sweat and water-resistant AirPods; I wore them without a second thought in light rain.\n\nKeeping them juiced up\n\nAs with second-generation AirPods (but not the originals), the case you charge the AirPods Pro models in can be wirelessly juiced up when placed on a compatible (Qi-certified) charging pad. The pillbox-size case on the Pro is a bit bigger than the cases on earlier models.\n\nApple is claiming up to five hours of listening time when Noise cancellation or Transparency mode is off, but only a half-hour less when they\u2019re on. That doesn\u2019t seem to be a big enough discrepancy to turn off either function though you're given the option.\n\nAccording to Apple, charging the Pro for just five minutes will give you about an hour of listening or talk time. And if the case is handy, you should have zero problems having AirPods Pro last throughout the day. You can also charge AirPods in the case with a Lightning cable. Either way, an LED indicator lets you know when they\u2019re fully charged.\n\nAs with earlier versions, the new AirPods can sense when they\u2019re in your ear.\n\nBut the star of the show is noise cancellation. The way Apple explains it, an outward-facing microphone detects external sounds, which are then countered by what\u2019s described as an \u201cequal anti-noise\u201d before you hear it. At the same time, that inward-facing mic listens inside your ear to eliminate unwanted internal sounds with anti-noise.\n\nApple says noise cancellation is continuously adjusted at 200 times per second. Whatever that actually means, it means unwanted noise is virtually eliminated.\n\nI\u2019m still fussing a bit with getting the fit just right. But when it comes to noise cancellation, silence is golden.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter", "description": "Apple's $249 AirPods Pro wireless headphones add noise cancellation and a mode to hear the outside world while you listen to music.
