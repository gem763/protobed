Last week, she was announced as co-headliner of the next Super Bowl half-time show, sharing that 100 million or so strong audience with Shakira. In a statement, she said it was a lifelong dream. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s made even more special not only because it\u2019s the NFL\u2019s 100th anniversary but also because I am performing with a fellow Latina. I can\u2019t wait to show what us girls can do on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d\n\nLopez is enjoying a career renaissance of epic proportions. In a way, epic proportions are a big part of her story in the first place. She closed the Versace show during Milan fashion week with a revival of \u201cthat\u201d green dress, 20 years after she wore it to the Grammys. So many people searched for it back then that it led Google to the creation of Google Images. She is also receiving that much-coveted Oscars buzz \u2013 not a bad turnaround for the woman who once uttered: \u201cIt\u2019s turkey time! Gobble gobble, gobble,\u201d widely considered the worst movie dialogue of all time \u2013 for Hustlers. She plays a blinder as Ramona Vega, a stripper turned con artist who either wants to wrap everyone up in her giant fur coat or drug them and fleece them, depending on which side of the transactions they are on. I went to see Hustlers the weekend it came out. I can\u2019t remember the last time I sat in a cinema filled, and it was filled, almost entirely with young women. My friend Louis audibly gasped when J-Lo performed her pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, a gravity-caressing pole dance to Fiona Apple\u2019s song Criminal. He grabbed my hand and whispered: \u201cShe\u2019s 50.\u201d Nobody shushed him.\n\nApple herself gave her blessing to Hustlers in an interview this week. \u201cI would give my song to Jennifer Lopez to dance to for free, any day, any time,\u201d she told Vulture. She also shared an anecdote about how, in the 1990s, she saw Lopez knocking a glass of champagne over with her behind, and not even noticing. \u201cIt was glorious.\u201d\n\nSuch is the ubiquity of Lopez right now that people are unearthing old interviews, as if nothing can satisfy the ravenous appetite for J-Lo. A 1998 chat has gone viral, thanks to her blunt assessments of Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna. There is something old-Hollywood about this glorious, carefree resurgence, and I love it.\n\nJesse Armstrong: For Fox sake, don\u2019t swear like the president\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jesse Armstrong poses with his Emmy award for Succession.

If he had not, frankly, it would have been an outrage, as the first-season finale is one of the best TV episodes in a very long time. Its brilliant but terrible wedding made every Christmas EastEnders look like it should have been on CBeebies. And it contained the line \u201cI\u2019m Shiv fucking Roy\u201d, which, let\u2019s face it, is probably the main reason why Armstrong won.\n\nCollecting the award, he said: \u201cQuite a lot of British winners. Maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions for shithole countries?\u201d At least, I think that\u2019s what he said, because \u201cshithole countries\u201d was muted. He was silenced, most likely, because he said the S-word, okay for a president but not broadcast television. Even so, given how cynical Succession is about its family-owned media empire forced to resist the constant criticism that it poisons the well of public discourse, the fact that Armstrong was bleeped by Fox was delicious.\n\nMark Ronson: \u2018Coming out\u2019 wasn\u2019t so clever\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Self-styled \u2018sapiosexual\u2019 Mark Ronson. Photograph: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Lego\n\nPoor Mark Ronson, who was recently nudged into saying he identified as a \u201csapiosexual\u201d on Good Morning Britain, after the show had just aired a discussion about it (in a way, he\u2019s lucky that\u2019s all they were talking about that day). A sapiosexual, for those who didn\u2019t catch the segment, is someone attracted to intellect, which is a bit of a humblebrag.\n\nRonson was caught between a rock and a hard Kate Garraway when it came to a response: if he\u2019d said no, he didn\u2019t care if women were smart or dumb, as long as they were pretty, I don\u2019t think he would have been much better off.\n\nStill, in yet another sign of Twitter\u2019s unrestrained loopiness, there was a backlash. Ronson had to walk back his coming out as a sapiosexual, even though anyone watching would have considered it a tepid and slightly baffled coming out, at best.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like I went on a TV show to be like, \u2018Guys, I have some big news!\u2019,\u201d he told Rolling Stone magazine.\n\n\u201cI would like to come out properly and say that I do not consider myself part of any marginalised community and I apologise if anybody misunderstood or took offence.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist", "description": "With her Super Bowl signing and talk of an Oscar for Hustlers, J-Lo is everywhere \u2013 and still working that old Versace dress", "authors": ["Rebecca Nicholson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3042e1418077946fe69eb60671bb076a1a538da3/0_206_3848_2309/master/3848.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6633ecc3e135d57d4cd738fcc0aecae3", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
