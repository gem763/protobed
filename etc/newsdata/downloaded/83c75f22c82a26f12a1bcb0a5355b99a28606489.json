Huawei\u2019s sales, by contrast, shot up by 66 per cent; the firm now has 42 per cent of the domestic market, according to an analysis by research firm Canalys released hours before Apple reports its earnings. (The Logic)\n\nTalking point: Huawei has grown by double digits for the past six quarters despite an overall slowdown in the Chinese smartphone market. That growth is bolstering the firm as it weathers a ban in the U.S. and a delay in sales in Europe, its second-largest market after China. For Apple, this is the latest setback in a market it once hoped to dominate. Part of the problem is that Huawei is ahead on 5G. So far in October, it\u2019s launched new 5G antennae and a 5G phone. Apple is looking to launch three 5G phones of its own in the next year. That could allow it to make more inroads in China, where 5G infrastructure is comparatively widespread. It\u2019ll also put pressure on other markets, including Canada, where little 5G infrastructure is ready. If the latest iPhones require 5G, the incentive to build the necessary infrastructure changes dramatically.", "description": "", "authors": ["Zane Schwartz"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
