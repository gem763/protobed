While the agency has a stable outlook, government borrowing has increased to help keep power utility Eskom afloat, economic growth has slowed and business confidence is near the lowest in more than three decades.\n\n\u201cSouth Africa\u2019s credit rating is in the hands of South African policy makers,\u201d Kganyago said in an interview with Bloomberg Television at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington on Thursday. \u201cSouth African policy makers know exactly what must be implement so that Moody\u2019s do not venture\u201d to a downgrade, he said.\n\nMoody\u2019s has urged the government to rein in spending and warned that the additional support announced for Eskom in July was \u201ccredit negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do the things that Moody\u2019s raised as credit concerns then we should not be worried about a downgrade,\u201d Kganyago said. \u201cBased on global financing conditions, South Africa\u2019s government bond yields should be lower than they are. If we do the right things, they will reprice.\u201d\n\nWhile the central bank usually refrains from commenting on fiscal policy, Kganyago and his Monetary Policy Committee have over the past year become more vocal on the urgent need for reforms, especially amid suggestions that the economy should be boosted by cutting interest rates.\n\nThe economic policy paper that the National Treasury released in August which contains a package of suggested reforms to boost growth is a \u201cwelcome development,\u201d Kganyago said. \u201cAt the very least it had enabled South Africa to frame the conversation about what\u2019s needed.\u201d\n\nEskom has amassed R450bn of debt and relies on state bailouts to remain solvent. It\u2019s battled to meet demand for electricity because most of its plants are old and have been poorly maintained. The utility started implementing rolling blackouts this week.\n\nThe central bank is assessing the risks Eskom holds for the economy from the angles of growth and financial stability, Kganyago said.\n\nIf Eskom is unable to meet electricity demand even at the current low levels of growth, it could become even more constrained if expansion accelerates, he said. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that the Treasury paper talks about increasing generation capacity, he said.\n\nThe central bank has run a series of stress tests and found the manner in which Eskom\u2019s debt is distributed is such that it would not pose a systemic risk to the financial system, he said.", "description": "\u201cSouth Africa\u2019s credit rating is in the hands of South African policy makers,\u201d said the central bank governor.", "authors": ["Rene Vollgraaff", "Francine Lacqua"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8089/86295cb9cce245b081016c2cf68024b9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
