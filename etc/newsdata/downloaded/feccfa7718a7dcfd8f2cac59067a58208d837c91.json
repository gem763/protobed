It blamed difficulties in markets outside Europe, like Argentina and Turkey in particular.\n\nThe company also said its operating margin was set to come in at 5%, versus a previous 6% goal, as it struggles to keep a lid on research and development costs.\n\nRenault shares dropped to a six year low of 46.7 euros and at 0805 GMT were down 13.1% at 47.69 euros.\n\nMany carmakers including Renault had already trimmed their goals a quarter earlier, though some like its French rival PSA Group bucked the trend.\n\nPeugeot-maker PSA is due to release its sales update next week, as will luxury carmaker Daimler, while Renault will provide a fuller readout for the third quarter.\n\nRenault's sales warning came less than a week after it revamped its management team in a bid to turn a page on the Ghosn era, appointing financial chief Clotilde Delbos as its interim CEO. Nissan also has new faces at the helm.\n\nDelbos said on Thursday evening the shake-up would pave the way for a renewed focus on joint projects that would allow the two to cut costs and usher in cleaner car models.\n\nThe worsening backdrop for carmakers adds urgency for the alliance to deliver, however.\n\n\"Needless to say that this profit warning comes at a time of major instability at Renault and its partner Nissan,\" analysts at Evercore said in a note. \"Investor worries will more likely intensify.\" (Reporting by Sarah White and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Mark Potter)", "description": "PARIS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A hefty profit warning sent  Renault shares tumbling as much as 15% on Friday,  capping a miserable year for the French carmaker...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
