Louie Douvis\n\nThe discussion began with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority\u2019s proposal to base 50 per cent of bank executives' bonuses on non-financial measures. This is an edited transcript of proceedings.\n\nGraham Bradley: I think APRA will get a lot of push back from the investment community and from directors because it\u2019s inconsistent with the accountability of directors that they should be constrained in structuring the objectives for rewarding their executives. Boards should have more discretion, not less, and many of the adverse outcomes on executive remuneration we\u2019ve seen were a function of boards having to put in place formulas then live with the results because that was the contract. I think APRA is trying to address the inherent problems of salespeople having revenue or sales-based bonuses.\n\nYasmin Allen: I agree with a lot of that, except that I wouldn\u2019t push back on APRA that way because there are always issues with hard-and-fast regulations. It\u2019s really important that as directors we understand the key drivers of our businesses and understand the risks \u2013 they\u2019re the things that we should have in our balanced scorecards because they will drive longer-term thinking, which will drive the financial outcomes that we want.\n\nBOSS: What about the impact on non-financial services companies, whatever APRA does or doesn\u2019t do?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Craig: I\u2019m a big believer in balanced scorecards. But with non-financial metrics, what is the measurement? If improving culture or improving customer satisfaction are key metrics, how do you measure that reliably?\n\nBruce Morgan: I\u2019m more concerned about the measures and what difference they could make to the performance of the company not just for shareholders, but more broadly for the communities you operate in.\n\nGB: Almost every company has a mix of strict profit-related or financial measures and more qualitative measures, which are more difficult to quantify and measure. But you can bet your life that when the profit goes down 25 per cent and you\u2019re giving your executives bonuses because they\u2019ve done really well on the net promoter score and on safety and on culture and on embedding and training, your remuneration report will be voted against.\n\nBOSS: I think it says in corporations law that it\u2019s incumbent on directors to act in the interests of the company, which is generally meant to assume a variety of stakeholders. Yet when it comes to remuneration, it is only voted on by shareholders.\n\nGB: While directors are entitled to consider wider stakeholders, their primary duty is to the people who elected them to look after their money: the shareholders. So your consideration of the wider stakeholder interests of employees, communities, customers and suppliers must all be in the context of what\u2019s best for the long-term prosperity of the company you\u2019re charged with protecting and nurturing.\n\nYA: I believe that if we are thinking for the long-term shareholder, not the high-frequency trader, that those two responsibilities are married very well. If we do the right thing by our customers, our communities, our shareholders, the company will prosper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBOSS: How are you all thinking about your current remuneration structures?\n\nGB: I don\u2019t know any director who\u2019s comfortable that they have the right measures in their short-term incentive (STI) plans. I think some of the hardest thinking directors have to do is around what real measures will have an impact on the performance of this company or will accurately reflect its performance in a way that balances all the relevant considerations. The problem is that every incentive you set, you have to ask yourself: what aberrant behaviour might this incentivise?\n\nChristine Bartlett: A big take-out from the royal commission for TAL was customer satisfaction. As a board, we get this very summarised result and don\u2019t see the tail ends, the very positives or the very negatives. We need to get greater insight on the people who have not had a good experience and why. At the board level it looks OK and it doesn\u2019t raise any red flags, but the royal commission taught us that there were significant red flags that we needed to find a way of unearthing.\n\nZlatko Todorcevski: What we\u2019ve done with one of the boards I\u2019m on is introduce a more structured behavioural assessment as part of the internal audit process. We\u2019ve set up eight parameters, including level of transparency, engagement, openness. That\u2019s going to be really insightful because that tells you what the audit team and others are seeing. As a board, you\u2019re never going to get to that level of detail.\n\nGB: In the board\u2019s own performance evaluation questionnaire, I\u2019ve always said the most important question is \u201cDoes bad news travel quickly to the board?\u201d It\u2019s a great indicator of whether there\u2019s a culture of suppressing bad news.\n\nCB: For our APRA risk culture review, we developed a number of scenarios where the answer wasn\u2019t obvious. Those scenarios were run at very junior levels, at middle management, at executive management and at the board, and we could look at how the answers varied depending on what part of the organisation the scenario ran in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think a lot of it is what decisions get made when there\u2019s no executive management in the room. Is our culture strong enough that people are making the right decisions for the organisation? That was a very interesting insight in terms of whether we\u2019ve embedded the culture broadly across the organisation.\n\nYA: I agree we should set the tone, and the way we treat each other and management absolutely sets a culture, but we have to hold management to account for that.\n\nDC: I think we\u2019ve got to understand that setting a tone in the way we deal with each other and we deal with central management does not necessarily permeate down the organisation.\n\nBOSS: Do you all think you have the right mix of skills on your boards?\n\nGB: The one criticism rightly levelled at some of the banks is that they didn\u2019t have enough bankers and people that understood the industry, in order to ask probing questions of management. So I think there will be a tendency to try to recruit more industry expertise and be able to ask questions and understand what\u2019s really going on.\n\nBOSS: And what about more entrepreneurs? Some people will say that entrepreneurs are good measured risk-takers.\n\nYA: They don\u2019t want to sit on boards. They\u2019ve made their billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGB: They\u2019re too smart to want to be on a board.\n\nYA: I\u2019ve always thought of boards in thirds. You need about one-third with deep sector experience because it\u2019s hard to hold management to account if you don\u2019t have that. Then you need a third financial skills, governance, remuneration \u2013 that\u2019s accountants and lawyers. And the last third is long-term business experience, track record, ability to understand cycles. But because of the fast pace of change, I think we need to think more carefully about bringing new skills in earlier.\n\nCB: The risk of having a specialist on the board is everybody defers to that individual and doesn\u2019t take the responsibility as a whole.\n\nI\u2019ve found it\u2019s really hard to actually carve out thinking space to reflect on the business and what\u2019s going well and what isn\u2019t. \u2014 Graham Bradley\n\nPeter van Dongen: One of the things that has emerged, along with having the right variety of skills, is ensuring that individuals have the strength of character to stand up and actually speak up and challenge.\n\nCB: For some key decisions we\u2019re going to experiment with asking one of our directors to put on the black hat and really challenge. We\u2019re saying: \u201cWe really want you to go as far out as you can in terms of picking holes in this.\u201d You don\u2019t want it all the time, but there are some key strategic decisions where it can be helpful.\n\nBOSS: Does anyone feel that you are too bogged down with governance and you don\u2019t have enough time to think more broadly about strategy and growing the actual business?\n\nGB: I think it\u2019s a constant challenge to make sure the balance is right. Risk reporting has become so onerous and voluminous that it often takes your thinking away from the real things that can go wrong and the real opportunities that we should be pursuing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYA: We\u2019re spending more and more time in our committees because there\u2019s so much additional work going on in audit, rem and culture. A lot of work is pushed down into the committees, and everyone is encouraged to attend every committee meeting. It frees up time at the board and the strategy days, and we make sure we carve out the right amount of time to lift our heads up and think long term.\n\nPVD: I had a conversation with an ASX 50 chairman, and he made the point that 60 per cent of his time was dealing with what he referred to as public company stuff.\n\nAll eyes are on global economic conditions. AP\n\nGB: I don\u2019t think the time spent at board meetings is the real measure of the issue here. It\u2019s the crowding out of your head space to think about the business more fundamentally, because you\u2019ve got so much to read and because you\u2019ve got so much on the committee agendas. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s really hard to actually carve out thinking space to reflect on the business and what\u2019s going well and what isn\u2019t.\n\nZT: What we found in a couple of boards was compliance matters were taking up way too much time at the scheduled board meetings, so we had to add on three days just to focus on strategy and nothing else.\n\nCH: One of the biggest shocks coming to a listed board was the sheer volume of reading. How do I make quality decisions if I get a 300-page report? I spend a lot of time telling management it\u2019s not about the number of pages. When I was in private equity, we had to prepare position papers that were no longer than three pages. It was some of the hardest, most rigorous discipline I learnt.\n\nBOSS: How confident are you about the Australian and global economy in the medium term?\n\nBM: I think everybody is watching carefully what\u2019s happening offshore. It doesn\u2019t feel like a massive crash, but it does feel like adjustment continuing. I\u2019m reasonably optimistic about the Australian economy, but I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of smaller retail fall away and more companies announcing downgrades. But it was reasonably steady through the reporting season, which was good for confidence.\n\nGB: The companies I\u2019m involved in are much more adversely affected by regulatory uncertainty within Australia than they are with international developments. Take energy policy in Australia, which is a shambles. State and federal governments are at odds, none of it is coherent. In banking, there are new regulations, or proposed regulations, coming every couple of weeks, causing uncertainty.\n\nBM: One piece of good news in NSW is infrastructure. The pipeline of state infrastructure spend at the moment is $93 billion.
