I carried out the policy of the United States government. That\u2019s what we should be focusing on. My son\u2019s statement speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nBiden added that he was \u201cproud of the judgment\u201d Hunter made to go public in a television interview, before quickly pivoting back on Trump himself. \u201cThis president on three occasions has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged to try and alter our elections,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about Trump\u2019s corruption.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), when asked a question about a federal jobs guarantee, used several moments of his time to appear to defend Biden.\n\n\u201cI want to say, I am having deja vu all over again,\u201d Booker started, dodging the moderator\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, because I saw this play in 2016\u2019s election. We are literally using Donald Trump\u2019s lies. And the second issue we cover is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. The only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump, seeing we are distracting from his malfeasance and selling-out of his office.\u201d\n\nThe elder Biden\u2019s comments came hours after his son gave his first interview about the unfounded allegations regarding his work in China and Ukraine\u2014allegations that have quietly dogged his father\u2019s 2020 campaign.\n\nSpeaking to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America about President Trump\u2019s claims of misconduct, which have been bolstered by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Hunter Biden didn\u2019t go as far to say he would have acted differently in serving on multiple boards of foreign companies. Instead, he stated explicitly that he \u201cdid nothing wrong at all,\u201d but conceded that he did not foresee the political toll his prior work would take on his father\u2019s current political fortunes.\n\nBiden\u2019s Rivals Are Utterly Perplexed at the Timing of Hunter\u2019s Interview\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it \u2014I know that there was\u2014did nothing wrong at all,\u201d Hunter Biden said in the Tuesday morning interview with ABC. \u201cHowever, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in\u2014in\u2014in many ways? Yeah.\u201d\n\nThe younger Biden\u2019s television appearance and the elder Biden\u2019s opening comments were not addressed by other candidates on the stage directly, though Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) appeared to try and piggyback on the subject before being cut off by the moderators.\n\nBefore the debate, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield reiterated that the younger Biden had decided independently to appear on TV the same day as the Democratic debate in Ohio.\n\n\u201cHim sitting down and answering every question is more than you can say for Donald Trump,\u201d she told CNN host Wolf Blitzer.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported on Monday that the timing of the interview was seen as perplexing by several rival campaigns, and even by a top Biden surrogate himself, who suggested the move was ill advised.", "description": "GettyFormer vice president Joe Biden offered a forceful defense of his son Hunter Biden during the opening moments of the fourth Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday, saying that attacks against him were levied by \u201cthugs\u201d President Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.\u201cMy son did nothing", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/304krvm_x_bxY.otENZkjQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/3e640c25d01e7036b012f130b06b3b75", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
