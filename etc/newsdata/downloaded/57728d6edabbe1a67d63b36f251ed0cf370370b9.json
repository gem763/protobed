Barr famously made racist comments about former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett last year, which led to the cancellation of her \u201cRoseanne\u201d revival.\n\nIn addition to calling Messing \u201cThe Mess,\u201d Trump wrote in his tweets that if Messing were Barr, she\u2019d have been \u201cthrown off television\u201d despite having higher ratings for her show, \u201cWill & Grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue?\u201d asked Trump. \u201cABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard!\u201d\n\nBad \u201cactress\u201d Debra The Mess Messing is in hot water. She wants to create a \u201cBlacklist\u201d of Trump supporters, & is being accused of McCarthyism. Is also being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness. If Roseanne Barr.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\n....said what she did, even being on a much higher rated show, she would have been thrown off television. Will Fake News NBC allow a McCarthy style Racist to continue? ABC fired Roseanne. Watch the double standard! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nTrump was referring to a tweet from Messing last week in which she responded to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter about a Beverly Hills fundraiser for the president.\n\n\u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know,\u201d wrote the 51-year-old.\n\nPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019\n\nMessing\u2019s tweet got a mixed reception, as some pushed back to argue that she was asking for a blacklist, while others insisted that those who support Trump should \u201cstand by their convictions.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comment about the \u201cterrible things she said about blacks and mental illness\u201d is referring to the hashtag #RacistDebraMessing, which trended earlier this week after she \u201cliked\u201d the image of a church sign that called Black Trump voters \u201cmentally ill.\u201d She has since apologized.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s distaste for the actress, who has long been a critic of Trump, the first family and outspoken supporters of the administration, NBC doesn\u2019t look to be canceling \u201cWill & Grace\u201d any time soon.\n\nThe network announced in July that it would continue its revival of the late-\u201990s/early-aughts show and wrap after its upcoming 2020 season.\n\nLove HuffPost?
