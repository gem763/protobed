The Pacific Ocean below sparkled a dazzling shade of blue, birds chirped and sang overhead, and cheerful bright orange poppies blanketed a nearby hillside embankment.\n\n\n\nThe crowd was here to take a self-guided tour of the Eames House, an architectural marvel of glass and steel, built by Charles Eames and his wife, Ray, in the late-1940s. The couple moved into the property on Christmas Eve 1949, and continued to live and work there for more than a quarter century until their deaths. In 2004, the couple\u2019s step-daughter, who then owned the house, gave it as a gift to the non-profit Eames Foundation, which she founded in part to protect it. In 2006, it was declared a National Historic Landmark.\n\n\n\nThe house, situated on a Pacific Palisades bluff, north of Santa Monica and south of Malibu, is \u201cunselfconscious,\u201d \u201ccreated in its own little world, screened all around by trees, foliage and hills,\u201d which serve as a \u201cshock absorber,\u201d according to the description of the property in the December 1945 issue of Arts & Architecture magazine. It was here that the Eames House was introduced as part of the magazine\u2019s famed Case Study Houses program, for which publisher John Entenza commissioned major architects of the day to design and build affordable and efficient model homes meant to address the mid-century housing boom and serve as a template for how returning GIs and their families wanted to live after World War II.\n\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1966, 36 homes were designed and 25 were built\u2014most of them in Los Angeles. The Eames House\u2014Case Study House #8\u2014is one of two that has nonprofit status, and is eagerly toured by architecture buffs from around the world. The other is Pierre Koening\u2019s iconic Stahl House\u2014Case Study House #22\u2014which overlooks the city\u2019s expanse from a point of remove in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nMore: Los Angeles Case Study House Finds Buyer\n\nOf the 23 homes that remain, three were demolished over the years, and another four were renovated past the point of recognition. The 16 Case Study Houses that remain in close-to or in their original forms, designed by architecture greats including Craig Ellwood and Richard Neutra, are owned and lived in by private individuals, and traded at a premium every time they change hands.\n\n\n\nBut why are these homes that were meant to be affordable, and cater to an average American family, now worth millions? The answer to that question is multi-layered.\n\nThere\u2019s the architecture itself, and the style that was introduced as part of the Case Study program\u2014modest in scale, modern and easy to live in, with a harmony between indoor and outdoor spaces, an abundance of natural light, and a type of open-floor plan that\u2019s still in demand today.\n\n\n\nFloor to ceiling windows in Case Study House #18. David Archer\n\nThen there\u2019s the land, handpicked decades ago because it was so good, with views of the ocean or mountains, flat lots, with a connection to nature, that is now near-impossible to find in an increasingly dense and urban L.A.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, more than anything, they\u2019re traded at a premium because over time, they have been elevated to become exceedingly rare classic works of art.\n\nMore: Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Last Home Goes up For Auction\n\n\u201cThis limited edition of homes will never be expanded\u2014and will, in fact, likely diminish\u2014because one will be destroyed somehow,\u201d said Billy Rose, president of the L.A.-based real estate firm The Agency, who sold Case Study House #20A for $12.5 million in 2016. \u201cThere is some intrinsic value to that.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd unlike in Europe or other parts of the world, where such rare and valued art might stay in a family for generations, in California, where the average person moves every four years, that isn\u2019t the case, said Frank Langen, a realtor with Deasy Penner Podley, who listed Case Study House #18 in April 2018 for $10 million. \u201cEverything is for sale in Southern California,\u201d Mr. Langen said, \"even the architecture.\u201d\n\nArt You Can Live In\n\nOne Case Study property that is considered functional art, not shelter, according to Mr. Rose, is Case Study House #21B, which sold in February for $3.26 million. Situated on an \u201cA\u201d lot in a Hollywood Hills canyon, the experimental and minimalist Pierre Koenig-designed property, which is also known as the \u201cWalter Bailey House,\u201d was originally designed for a childless couple, and is just 1,280 square feet.\n\n\n\nCase Study House #21 was designed by American architect Pierre Koenig. Matthew Momberger\n\nAdded to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, the property was bought by film producer Allison Sarofim from art gallerist P.J. Park in February. During the 12 years that Mr. Park owned the house, he occasionally used it as an outpost for his Seomi International Gallery, hosting art shows and exhibitions in the space, said Andy Butler, marketing director for Compass Realty\u2019s Aaron Kirman Partners group, who represented the seller in this sale.\n\n\n\nMore: British House Inspired by California Case Study Houses Hits Market\n\nAt that price\u2014over $3 million and close to $3,000 per square foot for what is essentially a one-bedroom apartment\u2014\u201cit\u2019s almost like buying a Picasso,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cBuyers of this type of home typically have tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of art in their private collection, of which this home is now part.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs part of an art collection, owners of Case Study Homes don\u2019t often live full-time in the property, but rather reside in a much larger space. Or if they do choose to live in it full time, it is \u201cfor a moment in their life,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cPeople want to live in the art\u2014to have parties there, and other architects come through\u2014but they probably wouldn\u2019t do that for any length of time because they are used to and can afford much more space.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Case Study Premium\n\nOnce it\u2019s clear why Case Study Homes are worth so much, the question becomes: Are they worth more than other similar mid-century homes designed by Case Study architects because of that label? Mr. Langen, who sold a non-Case Study home designed by Craig Ellwood, would say yes\u2014pointing to #21B as a reason why.\n\n\n\nKnown as \u201cThe Smith House,\u201d the property that he sold this summer, was completed in 1958, and is located in the architecturally significant Brentwood community of Crestwood Hills. At 1,500 square feet, with an additional 530 square feet of outdoor deck space, it is larger than the Koenig house, yet, at $2.3 million, sold for almost $1 million less. \u201cMine was arguably a better house,\u201d he said, \u201cin a better location.\u201d While the market did go down in the six months between the sales, at least part of the premium, he said, is based on the Case Study name.\n\nFrom Penta: Maserati Plugs In, Driven by Cool Technology and European Climate Regulations\n\nMr. Butler agreed. \u201cThe Case Study Program name definitely adds something extra,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBut sometimes, that price premium can be made less clear by outside factors, like the addition of a second home to a Case Study lot.\n\n\n\nThis happened to two of the three Case Study Homes that are located on lots adjacent to the Eames House on that Pacific Palisades bluff. For the first\u2014Case Study House #20A, which was designed by Richard Neutra and previously owned by the late-\u201cSimpsons\u201d TV series co-creator, Sam Simon\u2014there is a second, much larger (almost 9,000-square-foot) house on the lot. Mr. Rose sold the pair together in 2016 for $12.5 million, and notes that the high price wasn\u2019t for the Neutra home alone. But the second property may have negatively impacted a price-per-square-foot premium. \u201cThe other house kind of saddled the Case Study program home,\u201d Mr. Rose said, adding that he thinks they would have gotten a larger premium if they could have separated #20A out. \u201cThe other house just wasn\u2019t as sympathetic, or harmonious, with the land.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe second Pacific Palisades home with an additional much larger house on the lot is #9, which was designed by Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen, and is known as the \u201cEntenza House.\u201d As you walk up a long driveway to the Eames House, you can see the Entenza House to your left, and the two-story Barry Berkus behemoth that was built on the lot and blocks the Case Study Home\u2019s view. Together, the pair sold for $15.95 million in 2012.\n\nMore: How to Design an Eclectic Table That\u2019s Ideal for Entertaining\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re studying architecture, you learn about the Eames House, which is timeless, and perfectly integrates the home with nature,\u201d Mr. Langen said. \u201cBut then right next to it is the Berkus house, which is the only home on that plot that you can see from down on the beach. It serves as a sort of antithesis to the Case Study program.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe final Pacific Palisades lot houses Case Study House #18. This Rodney Walker-designer property, known as \u201cWest House,\u201d was listed in April 2018 for $10 million, and is currently being leased by a long-term renter for $20,000 per month.\n\n\n\nCase Study House #18 was listed for $10 million. David Archer\n\nAt just over 1,700 square feet, #18 is somewhat larger than the other Case Study Homes. But the current $20,000 per month lease price is significantly higher than what it is worth, Mr. Langen said, adding that, \u201cif it wasn't a Case Study house, there is no reason it should rent for more than $7,000 per month.\u201d Even if you tack on an extra $5,000 per month for the exquisite ocean views, that still leaves $8,000 per month left of value that in part can be attributed in part to the Case Study name.\n\n\n\nWhen it was listed for $10 million, Mr. Langen said much of that cost was for the land, as there is plenty of room to build on the half-acre lot. But because #18 is landmarked and can\u2019t be torn down, Mr. Langen said he has to wait for the right buyer. \u201cDesign sensibility and money don\u2019t always go hand in hand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a small market.\u201d\n\nMore: A Guide to the Season\u2019s New Developments\n\nCase Study House #18's current lease price is significantly higher than what it is worth, according to the property's listing agent. David Archer\n\nAn Enduring Legacy\n\n\n\nWhile Case Study Homes are rare, and the ones that remain no longer cater to the \u201caverage American,\u201d for which they were intended, their impact on affordable housing, private buildings and public community spaces is clear, said architect Michael Bohn, senior principal and design director at Studio One Eleven, a Southern California-based firm known for progressive, urbanist architecture.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat first group of Case Study architects established the outdoors as being important on both a city-scale and an individual building-scale,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich has been embraced by architects everywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen trying to address the affordable housing problem in Southern California by building more dense, mixed-use projects, architects know that it\u2019s important to have, \u201cample daylight and connectivity to the outdoors\u2014if not through a private yard, then through a private courtyard, that a lot of people can use at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our projects embrace the ideas of community and authenticity and indoor-outdoor harmony.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdditionally, as was the impetus of the Case Study Homes, affordability is often pursued by using new materials and new construction technologies, such as shipping containers, modular housing and new types of timber construction, as glass and steel were first used in residential design as part of the post-World War II program.\n\nMore: 8 Mid-Century Modern Furniture Finds to Add Retro Style to Your Space\n\nBeyond affordable housing, the principles of modernism introduced by the Case Study program, including the push to strip away the unnecessary and ornamental, including baseboards and moldings that you might find in \u201cOld World\u201d homes, like Tudors, and Mediterraneans, and focus on building homes that are functional and utilitarian, has also endured at all price points.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you drive through Palm Springs or the Bird Streets in Beverly Hills today, you see the effect of the Case Study Houses everywhere,\u201d Mr. Butler said.\n\n\n\nMr. Rose agreed. \u201cI typically get three to six calls every year from real estate agents who say, \u2018I\u2019ve got a client looking for a Case Study Home. Do you know anyone building one?\u2019\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cBut what their client is really looking for is a contemporary or modern home with indoor-outdoor harmony.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeventy years after their introduction, \u201cCase Study\u201d is now shorthand for that, Mr. Rose said, and for good reason. \u201cThey introduced us to a better way of living,\u201d he said, \u201cand a much better lifestyle.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Anne Machalinski"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-113896?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
