Henrotay\u2019s assistant was also arrested.\n\nA former professional player, Van Holsbeeck worked with Anderlecht from 2003-18.\n\nProsecutors said the wave of arrests is linked to searches that took place in April when Belgian police probed the offices of Anderlecht and the Belgian soccer association. Investigators are looking into alleged money-laundering operations and corruption involving the transfer of players.\n\nThis case is not related to the massive corruption scandal that engulfed Belgian soccer last year when authorities carried out 57 police raids in the country and around Europe in a probe into financial fraud and match-fixing.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Belgian police have arrested former Anderlecht executive Herman Van Holsbeeck as part of a money laundering and corruption investigation in soccer.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
