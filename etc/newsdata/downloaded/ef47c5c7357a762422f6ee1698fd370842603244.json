Over the first half of the season, Undone has done stellar character work, building out a small world of fascinating, complicated people in Alma\u2019s orbit.\n\nAnd in the show\u2019s fifth episode, much of that carefully laid groundwork finally pays off. What I love most about \u201cAlone in This (You Have Me)\u201d is the way it allows viewers to empathize with Alma as clearly and directly as her powers eventually enable her to empathize with Sam. Take the flashback scene where the young Alma sits, observing as her parents argue about her future. Jacob and Camila leap rapidly from topic to topic: The importance of American Sign Language vs. the importance of Spanish, the weirdness of Jacob\u2019s family, the debate over which holidays they should celebrate in December. And as Alma struggles to read lips fast enough to keep up with them, the episode\u2019s subtitles also get choppier, leaving the audience just as lost as Alma is.\n\nUndone plays another version of the same trick in the subsequent scene, after Alma gets her cochlear implant. In a previous episode, Jacob reminded Alma that people\u2019s voices initially sounded like \u201cducks and bells and robots\u201d after her procedure. But it\u2019s one thing to imagine that, and another thing to experience it like we do in this episode: Just as the young Alma experienced it, when she hated the harsh, metallic sound of her mother\u2019s voice so much that she tried to remove the implant.\n\nBack in the present, Undone gives one last vital opportunity to experience life from Alma\u2019s singular perspective, in the scene that gives this episode its title. When she says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone in this,\u201d both Jacob and Sam simultaneously respond, \u201cYou\u2019re not. You have me.\u201d But Jacob has far too much tunnel vision to appreciate where Sam is coming from, and Sam doesn\u2019t even know Jacob is there. For Alma alone \u2014 and by extension, for us \u2014 the stress of being pulled in opposite directions by these two men is painfully clear.\n\nSo: What should Alma do? The connective tissue in this episode is the way people have made decisions that they say are in Alma\u2019s best interest \u2014 without, you know, actually asking Alma what she wants. Jacob, for his part, spends much of the episode trying to get Alma to care about the origin story for all his research, which began on a family vacation to El Ba\u00f1o del Rey (The Bath of the King). But while plenty of Undone binge-watchers will be eager for Jacob to flesh out the show\u2019s mythology, Alma keeps getting distracted by her need to confront Sam, who she just learned has been pretending they never broke up since she came out of the coma.\n\nTheir subsequent confrontation certainly seems like it\u2019s headed toward another breakup. But then something interesting happens: Alma\u2019s ability kicks in, but she\u2019s transported to Sam\u2019s past instead of her own. She watches as the adolescent Sam \u2014 then called by his given name, Sanjeev \u2014 hugs his friends in India goodbye as his family leaves for the United States. She watches as his classmates mock him for his accent, and how he practiced an American accent with an old tape recorder until any trace of his old accent was gone.\n\nShe relives her own meet-cute with Sam, which took place over a bag of old dinner rolls from the restaurant where he works. She zips through a highlight reel of the best moments in their relationship: screaming happily on a roller coaster, kissing in a movie theater, hooking up in bed, taking a bath together.\n\nAnd then, crucially, Alma relives a memory with Sam that she doesn\u2019t share. She watches as he sits next to her comatose body in the hospital after the accident, holding her hand as he begs her not to die. And then she becomes him, marveling at the difference of perspective: \u201cMy hands feel so small to you.\u201d\n\nWhen Alma returns to the present again, she has a very simple message for Sam: \u201cI love you, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s okay.\u201d And when Sam is understandably surprised at this sudden flip in her attitude toward him, she offers this as an explanation: \u201cI just didn\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\n\nWhat Undone is implicitly arguing here is that truly understanding a difference in perspective is a fast-track to forgiveness. She doesn\u2019t need Sam to explain why he didn\u2019t tell her, because she\u2019s lived it from his point of view, and the reasons that made sense to him now make sense to her. It\u2019s yet another wrinkle in the development of Alma\u2019s ability, which can now break down the barriers between her and other people as easily as it can break down the barriers of reality and time.\n\nBut with Sam\u2019s secret out in the open, Alma decides it\u2019s her turn to come clean. So as the episode ends, she lays all the cards on the table at once: \u201cI\u2019m seeing my dead father because of my big ventricles, and he\u2019s training me to travel in time so I can save him from being murdered.\u201d\n\nSam\u2019s initial reaction \u2014 \u201cUhhhhhhhhhh\u201d \u2014 is understandable. The real question is whether or not he\u2019ll move past it. We\u2019ve already seen how much Alma can learn to understand about Sam with the benefit of her special ability. By the next episode, we\u2019ll see just how much Sam can understand Alma without it.\n\nPieces of mind\n\n\u2022 The solution to Alma\u2019s nagging questions about why the photos and the couch in the apartment had been moved around: While she was in the hospital, Sam moved his stuff back in, but didn\u2019t get the old placement quite right.\n\n\u2022 Another episode, another piece of highly questionable fatherly advice from Jacob: \u201cRelationships are hard, and they\u2019re always going to be hard, and it\u2019s better not to have them if you want to do what you want to do.\u201d\n\n\u2022 So Sam\u2019s big secret is out in the open. What\u2019s the over-under on when Reed Hollingsworth will find out Becca cheated on him with the bartender?\n\n\u2022 Sam says Alma is the only person, living or dead, who understands him \u2014 except Maya Angelou.\n\n\u2022 Jacob\u2019s mother Geraldine used to hum the same melody Jacob later hears from a person carrying an armadillo-shell guitar at El Ba\u00f1o del Rey, in yet another nod to how Alma\u2019s grandmother might have shared some version of her superpower. We\u2019ve heard a lot about Geraldine throughout Undone, but we\u2019ve rarely seen her. I hope she\u2019s due for a spotlight episode soon.", "description": "Alma\u2019s ability can now break down the barriers between her and other people as easily as it can break down the barriers of reality and time.
