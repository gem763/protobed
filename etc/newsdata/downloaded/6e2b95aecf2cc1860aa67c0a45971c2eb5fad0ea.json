REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nAlice Wells, the acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, referred to a plan laid out by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for restoring political life in Jammu and Kashmir after India last month removed the decades-old autonomy it had enjoyed under India\u2019s constitution.\n\n\u201cI think we are interested in knowing the next steps,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cWe hope to see rapid action in the lifting of restrictions and the release of those who have been detained.\u201d\n\nWells added that \u201ca lowering of rhetoric would be welcome, particularly between two nuclear powers.\u201d\n\nMuslim-majority Kashmir has long been a flashpoint between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. Both countries rule parts of Kashmir while claiming it in full. Two of the three wars they have fought have been over it.\n\nWells spoke after U.S. President Donald Trump met separately with both Modi and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump urged Modi to improve ties with Pakistan and \u201cfulfill his promise to better the lives of the Kashmiri people,\u201d the White House said.\n\nThe previous day Khan had urged Trump in a meeting to use U.S. influence to help end India\u2019s \u201csiege\u201d of the volatile territory.\n\nIn its clampdown in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir, which has a Muslim-majority, India flooded the territory - already one of the world\u2019s most militarized zones - with troops, imposed severe restrictions on movements, and cut all telephone, mobile phone and internet connections. Thousands of people were arrested.\n\nNew Delhi has since eased some of the curbs, although no prominent detainees have been freed and mobile and internet connections remain suspended.\n\nTrump this week reiterated that he would be willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Wells said Modi had made clear he was not seeking mediation.", "description": "The United States hopes to see rapid action by India to lift restrictions it has imposed in Kashmir and the release of detainees there, the senior U.S. diplomat for South Asia said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434341153&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q00H", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
