'That is a terrible abuse of the president's power. Now whether that abuse goes further, that is the withholding of military aid also as leverage, there's certainly strong indications that that is true as well.'\n\nTrump froze millions in military aid to Ukraine a few days before his call with Zelensky \u2013 another move that led Democrats to claim the president was setting a 'quid pro quo.'\n\nHowever, Trump says the money had nothing to do with the conversation about corruption, and Zelensky insists he did not feel pressured by Trump and says the two did not discuss the military aid in their call.\n\nNancy Pelosi announced last month that the House was launching an impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nA few days after the whistle-blower's complaint detailing the call was revealed, House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nSchiff is leading the impeachment proceedings against the president, and has even taken over some of the hearings committees he does not chair are holding in relation to the phone call.\n\nHe also said that Republicans want the hearings to be public so they can try and continue to act as 'lawyers' and defenders of Trump and allow witnesses to hear what others say during their testimony.\n\n'If witnesses could tailor their testimony to other witnesses, they would love for one witness to be able to hear what another witness says so they know what they can know what they can give away and what they can't give away,' Schiff said.\n\nHunter Biden took a board position with Ukrainain oil company Burisma Holdings in 2014 \u2013 while his father was still vice president. He stepped down from that board earlier this year.\n\nTrump also claims that Hunter made $1.5 billion from a private equity firm in China after he flew there in December 2013 with his father aboard Air Force Two.\n\nHunter has denied playing a role in forming the Chinese company or having equity in it while his father was in office and insists the board position was unpaid.\n\nThe former vice president\u2019s son has stepped down from his post on the board of the Chinese-backed private equity company.\n\nThe lawyer and lobbyist also vowed to avoid any conflict of interest and claims he will forego all foreign work if his father is elected president in 2020, stressing that he never discussed any of his business activities with his father.\n\nThis is, however, contrasted by his earlier comments this summer where he said in 2015 he discussed the status of his position with Burisma.\n\nTrump claims that Hunter has 'disappeared' ever since controversy surrounding his business dealings have come to the forefront.", "description": "Adam Schiff said Congress does not have to prove a 'quid pro quo' in order to pursue impeachment against Donald Trump.
