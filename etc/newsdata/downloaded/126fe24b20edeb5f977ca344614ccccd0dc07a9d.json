And a possible Breyer retirement brings into play a dreadful prospect for Democrats \u2014 a 7-2 conservative majority.\n\nAxelrod\u2019s depressing political forecast is rooted in the bald hypocrisy being practiced by McConnell.\n\nRemember McConnell prevented Obama from putting a justice on the high court with nearly a year to go before the next election.\n\nBut now, McConnell contends, Trump can put a nominee on the court with a year to go before the next election because the same party, the GOP, controls the Senate and the White House.\n\nThis is a remarkable, self-serving double standard. It shows a blatant lack of fair play, certain to ignite bitter political division. With a 53-47 majority in the Senate, the Republicans\u2019 only concern is losing the vote of one of their own \u2014 say, Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsJuan Williams: McConnell's Supreme Court hypocrisy Murphy sees 'path' to White House deal on background checks Democrats see golden opportunity to take Georgia Senate seat MORE of Maine. With no filibuster, the GOP does not need any votes from Democrats.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s goal is to secure his political legacy as the man who cemented a conservative majority on the high court to counter the liberal ideas emerging from the rising number of younger, more racially diverse and more progressive voters in the country.\n\nHe will also go down in history as the man who drained all trust from the Founding Fathers\u2019 commitment to a nation of laws beyond the tyranny of any one political ideology or party.\n\nIt does not take a fortuneteller to predict that another conservative on the court will stir up rage.\n\n\u201cSenator McConnell is a hypocrite,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerFEMA chief: Transfer of agency funds for immigration 'not affecting our preparedness whatsoever' Pelosi, Schumer call on McConnell to take up background check bill after Texas shooting Schumer seeks vote on bill reaffirming support for democracy in Hong Kong MORE (D-N.Y.) tweeted back in May.\n\nHe added, \"Seriously it\u2019s no surprise. @SenateMajLdr McConnell lives for GOP judges because he knows the GOP agenda is so radical & unpopular they can only achieve it in courts. Anyone who believes he\u2019d ever allow confirmation of a Dem President's nominee for SCOTUS is fooling themselves.\"\n\nIn an unprecedented move, five Democratic senators filed an amicus brief last month urging the court to drop its review of a landmark gun control case because of the National Rifle Association\u2019s work to inflame public opinion and bias the court.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is not well,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cAnd the people know it. Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, South Bend, Ind.
