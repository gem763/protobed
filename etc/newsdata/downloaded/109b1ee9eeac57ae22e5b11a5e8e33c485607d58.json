As we walked through the streets in pink leggings, chanting, \u201cCourage, strength and power,\u201d it felt like a true girlfriends\u2019 getaway with high-energy sisterhood in the air. That is, until the first text message came through around noon: When are you coming home?\n\nIt was from one of our husbands, who had spent the morning with the kids and now was \u201cdone,\u201d he said. As we watched our friend type back a response, nearly every woman in the group felt her own phone come to life with a similar message:\n\nWhen is the babysitter coming?\n\nWhere did you put the soccer bag?\n\nWhat\u2019s the address of the birthday party?\n\nDo the kids need to eat lunch?\n\nWhere are Anna\u2019s pants?\n\nThe last one was from my husband, Seth. I gave him a call to see what was going on. \u201cWell, I guess we can\u2019t go to the park because you\u201d\u2014he emphasized\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t leave me any clothes.\u201d After 30 calls and 46 texts (I counted them) from the husbands, sitters, neighbors and mothers-in-law who had been called in to rescue and cover for the 10 of us in our absence, one of our group finally said what we were all thinking: \u201cMaybe we should just skip lunch and go home?\u201d\n\n\u201c Women feel overwhelmed, but the solution isn\u2019t necessarily for their partners to share strictly equally in their efforts at home. \u201d\n\nConsidering my hectic, dual-career household, it didn\u2019t seem right to me to have to leave my preplanned event early over a pair of missing pants. My husband and I always teach our kids to be \u201cfair\u201d and to make things \u201cequal\u201d when they squabble. So why doesn\u2019t \u201cequal\u201d ever seem to work when it comes to sharing family duties in our household?\n\nI decided to dig into the issue. I\u2019m trained as a lawyer, mediator and negotiator, and my whole job is to find win-win solutions to thorny issues, so I put my researcher hat on and went to work. Over the course of several years, I interviewed more than 500 men and women about how they divide responsibilities at home and spoke with a range of experts who have studied the problem.\n\nMy chief finding: Women feel overwhelmed, yes. But the solution isn\u2019t necessarily for their partners to share strictly equally in their efforts at home.\n\nTrue, women continue to do the lioness\u2019s share\u2014two-thirds\u2014of domestic labor in the home, even in two-earner families in which both parents work full-time, according to a 2012 study in the journal Social Forces. And a well-known study from the 1990s, in the American Journal of Sociology, found that the more married women earned compared with their husbands, the less housework the husbands did.\n\nWhat to do? Here\u2019s a perhaps counterintuitive solution: Instead of setting an unattainable ideal of men doing exactly equal work on the home front, women should ask their partners to completely \u201cown\u201d the jobs that they do take on. Maybe husbands will still do less than wives, but they will do more of their lesser share.\n\nIt\u2019s when work gets done partway by each partner, or needs excessive input and oversight from one, that communication\u2014and marriages\u2014break down. A recent survey by researchers at Harvard Business School revealed that 25% of divorced couples listed \u201cdisagreements about housework\u201d as the top reason for breaking up. When I asked women what makes the biggest difference in their marital satisfaction, they said that it depends much less on whether tasks are split 50/50 in the household than on whether their partners fully conceive, plan and execute a task.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any grand illusions of my husband doing equal to what I do,\u201d confided one woman from Ann Arbor, Mich., \u201cbut I would like him to take responsibility for those things he promised to \u2018handle\u2019 and without reminders from me.\u201d\n\nA study by Harvard researchers published this year in the American Sociological Review found that women reported doing more \u201ccognitive labor\u201d at home than their spouses did\u2014such as anticipating needs (the kids prefer mustard to ketchup on their hot dogs), monitoring progress (are we running low on mustard?), identifying options (is the grocery store still open?) and making decisions (Dijon or yellow?). Men often don\u2019t see or value this sort of invisible work until they start to do it themselves.\n\nMy interviews with men confirmed what a famous 2005 time-diary study funded by the National Science Foundation found: When they were self-reporting, the men tended to overestimate how much of the domestic work and child care they actually do, because they weren\u2019t factoring in the cognitive labor.\n\n\u201c Many studies have found that the perception of fairness is a stronger predictor of a healthy marriage than the actual division of labor. \u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: Among couples I interviewed, once they began to understand every part of what was required to meet a responsibility fully, the sense of fairness shifted. Specifically, when women felt relieved of a share of the cognitive labor, they reported that the division of tasks was more equitable\u2014even when the division was not straight down the middle.\n\nMany studies, including one in 2017 funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, have found that the perception of fairness is a stronger predictor of a healthy marriage than the actual division of domestic labor. Men I interviewed who reported feeling the most confident and invested in their domestic roles were those whose wives trusted them with full ownership of household and child care tasks.\n\n\u201cThe idea of \u2018fair, not equal\u2019 has already changed the dynamic in my home,\u201d reported one of my early female beta-testers from Los Angeles. \u201cMy husband...is now \u2018owning,\u2019 not just \u2018helping\u2019 with tasks. He already does a lot, but it was typically piecemeal, requiring my input, thus negating any mental relief for me. But now the dialogue has begun, and we talk about what are \u2018his\u2019 tasks and what are mine.\u201d\n\nThis management-style approach has been helping professional organizations thrive for decades, and it drives the culture at many of the most successful companies today. Apple coined the term \u201cDirectly Responsible Individual\u201d to refer to the person with whom the buck stops on any given project. Netflix has its own model: the \u201cRare Responsible Person.\u201d It\u2019s the ideal team member, someone who doesn\u2019t wait to be told what to do but instead is self-motivated, takes the lead and \u201cpicks up trash from the floor.\u201d\n\nAll of the thousands of tasks required to create our favorite products and bring them into our homes have benefited from project managers whose job is to conceive, plan and oversee how each one will be completed. They will tell you that they live or die by this model, because it\u2019s the most efficient way to get things done.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking: \u201cYeah, sure, that works in the professional world, but it\u2019s not the way we do things in our home,\u201d let me stop you. I\u2019ve tested this systems approach with couples from all walks of life\u2014from two-career couples to stay-at-home parents, all across the country, with people of diverse backgrounds and life experiences. I have found that the couples who adhere to this method experience a dramatic shift away from dysfunction, resentment and passive-aggressive behavior and toward more time-saving efficiency and feelings of fairness.\n\nIt certainly changed my family for the better when my husband took over managing the logistics of extracurricular sports for my two sons. I gained back eight hours a week. Think about everything that just this one task requires you to anticipate: What equipment do they need? What\u2019s the game schedule? When do you have to provide the team snack? Who\u2019s driving the carpool? Once my husband understood how \u201cownership\u201d invites a stronger and more fulfilling parenting role, he willingly offered to do more\u2014and without any nagging reminders from me. We both consider this a win.\n\nYour \u201cfair\u201d won\u2019t look like mine, and it will likely change over time. But getting it right isn\u2019t a luxury, it\u2019s a necessity\u2014for a happy home with two happy people who collaborate rather than compete.\n\n\u2014This essay is adapted from Ms. Rodsky\u2019s new book, \u201cFair Play: A Game-Changing Solution for When You Have Too Much to Do (and More Life to Live),\u201d which will be published by Putnam on Oct. 1.
