Allies of the president had leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty against Yovanovitch.\n\nLivingston is another well-connected Republican who, along with Giuliani, advocated against Yovanovitch. Others include Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and former Republican congressman Pete Sessions.\n\nDemocratic Representative Gerald Connolly said he was shocked to hear of Livingston\u2019s role, adding: \u201cWe would love to know what possessed him to recommend the firing of an honorable career foreign service ambassador who was doing a good job in protecting U.S. interests and trying to promote democracy in Ukraine.\u201d Another House Democrat, Peter Welch, called Livingston\u2019s actions \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d\n\nIn the latest move in the fast-moving impeachment inquiry, former White House national security adviser John Bolton has been asked to testify next week, said a source familiar with the matter.\n\nNational Security Council lawyer John Eisenberg and Eisenberg\u2019s deputy, Michael Ellis, have been asked to appear on Monday, the source said.\n\nBolton, a Republican foreign policy hawk who served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser from April 2018 until he was fired by Trump on Sept. 10, has emerged as a key figure in internal White House efforts to stymie efforts to spur a Ukraine investigation into the Bidens.\n\nTim Morrison, the top Russia specialist on Trump\u2019s National Security Council, is due to testify on Thursday. Morrison resigned from his position on Wednesday, a senior administration official said.\n\n\u2018OBAMA HOLDOVER\u2019\n\nThe impeachment inquiry focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a former vice president, and his son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Trump has denied wrongdoing.\n\nCroft, who testified for roughly five hours on Wednesday, was a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House from July 2017 to July 2018.\n\nShe said Livingston characterized Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 who was associated with liberal activist George Soros.\n\nSoros is a wealthy financier often assailed by conservatives and known for his support of liberal causes. Barack Obama was Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time - or now - at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d Croft said.\n\nGiuliani has admitted sending to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a packet of information in March including a document describing a discredited theory promoted by Trump allies that Yovanovitch was installed in her post in Kiev by Soros and that unless she was removed, Soros \u201chas as much, or more power over Yovanovitch as the president and the Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nAs a congressman, Livingston played a prominent role in the Republican-led drive to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton for lying about his relationship with an intern before quitting in 1998 when it emerged he had engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nU.S. foreign service officer Catherine Croft, who once served as a deputy to then-Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, arrives to testify as part of the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Trump led by the House Intelligence, House Foreign Affairs and House Oversight and Reform Committees on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 30, 2019. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko\n\nLobbying disclosure filings with the Justice Department showed Livingston\u2019s firm represented two Ukrainian clients in Washington. They are former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who mounted an unsuccessful run for president this year in the election won by Zelenskiy in a landslide in April, and an association of Ukrainian metal producers.\n\nRepublican former congressman Bob McEwen, who works as a consultant to Livingston\u2019s firm, introduced Tymoshenko to Trump\u2019s lawyer last December, the filings showed.\n\nThe firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCONFLICTED OVER UKRAINE\n\nAnother Ukraine specialist at the State Department, Christopher Anderson, who also testified on Wednesday, described a conflicted administration on Ukraine policy. Trump\u2019s negative view was often at odds with other State Department and White House officials, who underscored Kiev\u2019s importance to U.S. national security in the face of Russian aggression, their testimony showed.\n\nYovanovitch testified earlier this month that she did not know Giuliani\u2019s motives for attacking her and that she believed she was ousted based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s nominee to become U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, testified in his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday that he knew earlier this year about Giuliani\u2019s involvement in the campaign to oust Yovanovitch.\n\nTrump\u2019s July telephone call is at the heart of the congressional inquiry into whether he misused the power of his office for personal political gain and, if so, whether that rises to the level of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d that merit impeachment and removal from office under the Constitution.\n\nIf the Democratic-led House approves formal charges against Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate would hold a trial on whether to remove him from office.\n\nTrump made his request to Zelenskiy for an investigation into the Bidens after withholding $391 million in security aid approved by Congress to help Ukraine fight Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskiy agreed to Trump\u2019s requests. The aid was later provided.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nSeparately, the House Rules Committee weighed legislation laying out procedures for the next steps in the impeachment inquiry, with a vote by the full House due on Thursday.\n\nRepublicans have accused Democrats of trampling on Trump\u2019s rights and keeping the process too secret.", "description": "Further evidence of private interests seeking the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch emerged on Wednesday in testimony to a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump's conduct toward that country.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446540904&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T159", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
