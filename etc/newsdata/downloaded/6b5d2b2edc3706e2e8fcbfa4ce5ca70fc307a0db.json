Sibanye said resuming production at Masakhane mine in April next year should result in increased annual production from the local gold operations in 2019.\n\nDeath toll\n\n\n\nThe death toll at Sibanye-Stillwater's operations in 2018 alone stands at 21 \u2013 close to half of the fatalities in the entire mining industry.\n\nThe high death toll prompted an outcry from labour unions and government, with CEO Neal Froneman describing himself as \"deeply saddened and traumatised\" by the many deaths.\n\nFroneman has previously stated that the seismic events were part of deep mining and impossible to prevent.\n\nThe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has called for tighter amendments to the Mining Safety Act, in a bid to hold mining companies accountable.\n\nLast week, two US law firms indicated that they had filed class action lawsuit against Sibanye on behalf of shareholders who want to recover losses.\n\n\n\nThe class action period stretched from April 7, 2017 to June 26, 2018.\n\nNew York-based law firm Bernstein Liebhard said that during this period the company failed to disclose to its shareholders that its \"culture places short-term profits over safety\" and, as a consequence, \"almost half of South Africa's 2018 mining fatalities occurred in Sibanye mines\".\n\nAt the time, Sibanye said it would \"vigorously\" defend itself.\n\nSibanye is listed on the JSE and the NYSE. The company's shares ended Tuesday at R8.20, down 2.03%, on the JSE.", "description": "Sibanye-Stillwater expects the gold production from its mines in South Africa to be 6% lower due to the recent spate of underground fatalities that have halted operations.", "authors": ["Sibongile Khumalo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1666/36889cbeec994cd8b3fef33b0d2da6fb.jpg", "published_at": "2018-07-04"}
