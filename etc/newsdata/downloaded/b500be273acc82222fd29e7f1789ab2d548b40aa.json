Trump is expected to attend a fundraiser hosted by Chicago Cubs co-owner and Trump Victory Committee Finance Chairman Todd Ricketts at Trump Tower following the address. The visit is Trump's first official visit to the city since protesters forced him to cancel a 2016 campaign rally in the city.

Democrats think they might have that in Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who will testify today.\n\nVINDMAN -- a Ukrainian-born, two-decade veteran of the U.S. Army with a Purple Heart from fighting in Iraq -- will testify today that \u201che believed President Donald Trump undermined U.S. national security when he appealed to Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rivals,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s summary of his dramatic opening statement says.\n\nSHOULDN'T THIS END ALL DISCUSSION OF THE WHISTLEBLOWER? There is now a named person who heard the call with Volodymyr Zelensky, was concerned about its contents and reported it to a government attorney.\n\nANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY: \u201c\u2018I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u2019 Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official overseeing Ukraine policy, plans to tell investigators, referring to Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into Joe Biden and his son.\n\n\u201cVindman, who will become the first White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry, also plans to say that he reported Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelensky to the NSC\u2019s top lawyer after listening in on the conversation from the White House situation room alongside other U.S. national security officials.\n\n\u201cIt was the second time Vindman had raised concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel about a campaign by Trump, his associates and some U.S. officials to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations intended to benefit Trump politically.\n\n\u201c\u2018I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u2019 Vindman plans to say. \u2026 \u2018This would all undermine U.S. national security,\u2019 Vindman adds. \u2018Following the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u2019\u201d POLITICO \u2026 The opening statement\n\n-- BTW: NBC\u2019S MONICA ALBA and CAROL LEE: \u201cInternal White House debate stifles release of Pence-Zelenskiy call\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s been almost three weeks since Vice President Mike Pence said he had \u2018no objection\u2019 to releasing a reconstructed transcript of his phone call with the leader of Ukraine. But as House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry continues moving swiftly into its second month, the White House still has not made a decision on whether to make those details of Pence\u2019s call public.\u201d NBC\n\nDEMOCRATS\u2019 NEW PLAY \u2026 SARAH FERRIS, HEATHER CAYGLE and KYLE CHENEY: \u201c[A House Democratic resolution that will get a vote this week] will grant investigators authority to sidestep traditional time limits on questioning witnesses in public hearings and spell out specifics of the due process rights Democrats intend to provide Trump and his legal team once the probe moves into the public domain. \u2026\n\n\u201c\u2018This is a resolution on how to proceed in the committee,\u2019 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday evening. \u2018This resolution gives us more opportunity in the committee, spells out protection of the rights for the president and his counsel. They should welcome this.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 move is in some ways an answer to the White House\u2019s Oct. 8 letter declaring the president\u2019s refusal to cooperate with an impeachment inquiry they describe as \u2018constitutionally invalid\u2019 and \u2018a violation of due process.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nMAKE NO MISTAKE: THIS RESOLUTION will be positioned as a proxy vote for impeachment. Republicans say they will not vote for this, and instead will hang this vote around every Democrat\u2019s neck. A vote for this, they tell us, will be viewed as a vote approving the entirety of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment effort. The GOP will try to make Democrats who vote yes own every element of the impeachment process from here on out. Democrats tried to sidestep a vote just a week or so ago, and Republicans have been urging a vote, so both sides have reversed their positions here.\n\nWE ARE TOLD THAT THIS RESOLUTION will also enumerate the findings of the probe so far -- but that\u2019s not certain because it\u2019s not wrapped up yet.\n\nDEMOCRATS ARE TAKING THIS VOTE in a very public and transparent way. If they wanted less attention on what they are terming a rule change, they could've tucked this into an unrelated bill and it probably would've gotten through the House with little fanfare.\n\nWSJ ED BOARD: \u201cPelosi Concedes on Inquiry Vote\u201d: \u201cVindication is overrated, but we\u2019ll take it in the case of a House vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry. We\u2019re referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s letter Monday to fellow Democrats that she\u2019ll offer a resolution on the House floor this week that will set the terms of its impeachment investigation. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe Speaker\u2019s letter asserts that no such vote is needed but nonetheless says the House will have one. This is what you say when you know your critics have been right but you don\u2019t want to admit it. Thanks also to the Speaker for embarrassing the many media apologists for her previous skip-the-vote stance.\u201d WSJ\n\nBY THE WAY \u2026 IT\u2019S PRETTY NOTABLE how quickly the news has turned from Trump directing the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi back to impeachment.\n\nA message from PhRMA: FACT: The biopharmaceutical industry supports more than 4 million jobs across the United States.

Doug Jones, who won a 2017 special election to fill the remainder of Sessions' term and is widely viewed as the most vulnerable senator on the ballot next year. \u2026\n\n\u201cFive Republicans are already in the race: Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, the former state Supreme Court judge who lost the special election in 2017 amid allegations of sexual misconduct.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- HOW WILL THE PRESIDENT HANDLE THIS, and will it matter? By dint of his $2.5 million cash pile, SESSIONS will probably be the prohibitive favorite in this race. He\u2019s a known entity in Alabama, a deeply red state, and has an identity outside his tumult with the president -- we think!

Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg is set to tell lawmakers the company made mistakes that contributed to two fatal airplane crashes, as the aerospace giant struggles to regain public trust.\n\n\u201cAhead of Mr. Muilenburg\u2019s appearance this week before two key U.S. House and Senate panels, Boeing released a draft of his planned remarks including an outline of steps Boeing is taking to return its 737 MAX jets to passenger service following the crashes that claimed 346 lives and left the aircraft grounded world-wide for more than eight months.\n\n\u201cThe first hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation comes exactly a year after the crash of a Lion Air MAX into the Java Sea. It will be Mr. Muilenburg\u2019s first congressional appearance as CEO. \u2018We know we made mistakes and got some things wrong,\u2019 he said in the prepared remarks. \u2018We own that, and we are fixing them.\u2019\u201d WSJ\n\nBURGESS EVERETT: \u201cThe new Democratic senator irritating the left and delighting the GOP\u201d: \u201cShe rarely goes to party lunches and skipped Senate votes to run the Ironman. She endorsed a primary challenger against one of her own colleagues and hobnobs with Republicans at least as much as she does with her own caucus.\n\n\u201cKyrsten Sinema doesn\u2019t really fit in with her fellow Senate Democrats. Don\u2019t even ask her whether she watches the Democratic presidential debates. \u2018I\u2019m not missing anything. I prefer happiness,\u2019 Sinema declares in a 25-minute interview, a rare extended conversation with an outlet not based in Arizona. \u2018Look how happy I am.\u2019\n\n\u201cArizona\u2019s first Democrat to win a Senate race in 30 years has done little to raise her profile in Washington; she\u2019s more focused on trying to balance her extreme workout regime with a moderate record on par with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s.\n\n\u201cSinema has long cultivated a bipartisan posture. But her support for Donald Trump nominees like Attorney General William Barr and her lack of zeal for impeachment are part of a political profile drawing blowback from progressives and cheers from the GOP. Yet Sinema is also setting herself up to be a pivotal vote the next time the Democrats are in power. And her radical breed of centrism could be a headache for the party.\u201d POLITICO\n\nBIG HOUSE NEWS \u2026 CHARLOTTE OBSERVER: \u201cNew maps ordered for NC 2020 congressional races, in win for Democrats,\u201d by Will Doran: \u201cThe legislature must now redraw the state\u2019s 13 U.S. House districts. The [judges] \u2014 two Democrats and one Republican from different parts of North Carolina \u2014 wrote that the maps show signs of \u2018extreme partisan gerrymandering\u2019 which \u2018is contrary to the fundamental right of North Carolina citizens to have elections conducted freely and honestly to ascertain, fairly and truthfully, the will of the people.\u2019\n\n\u201cMonday\u2019s ruling, a preliminary injunction, said the state may not hold any elections for Congress using the current maps passed in 2016. Those maps replaced a different set of maps from 2011, also drawn by the Republican-led legislature, which were struck down as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering. The judges ruled that if there aren\u2019t new maps in time for the primary elections on March 3 then they could delay all or some of the primaries until later in 2020.\u201d Charlotte Observer\n\n2020 WATCH -- DAVID SIDERS and JEREMY WHITE in Los Angeles: \u201c\u2018The West barely exists\u2019: California primary falls flat\u201d: \u201cKamala Harris is running a distant fourth in her home state of California.

Jay Inslee and California Rep. Eric Swalwell \u2014 have already dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary, and two more \u2014 Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Colorado Sen.

And the promise of an early California primary tilting the balance of the Democratic primary westward has fallen short.\n\n\u201cMost campaigns are still spending far more time \u2014 and resources \u2014 in Iowa, the first caucus state, leaving Westerners to watch the campaign unfold primarily on TV.

Mr. Kushner\u2019s message has been that the facts are in the White House\u2019s favor, and that reduces the need to be on the defensive, according to White House officials familiar with the conversations.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- NBC\u2019S JOSH LEDERMAN and DAN DE LUCE: \u201cThe White House was alerted as early as mid-May \u2014 earlier than previously known \u2014 that a budding pressure campaign by Rudy Giuliani and one of President Donald Trump's ambassadors was rattling the new Ukrainian president, two people with knowledge of the matter tell NBC News.\n\n\u201cAlarm bells went off at the National Security Council when the White House's top Europe official was told that Giuliani was pushing the incoming Ukrainian administration to shake up the leadership of state-owned energy giant Naftogaz, said the sources. The official, Fiona Hill, learned then about the involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Giuliani associates who were helping with the Naftogaz pressure and also with trying to find dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cHill quickly briefed then-National Security Adviser John Bolton about what she'd been told, said the individuals with knowledge of the meeting.\u201d NBC\n\nBILL BARR SPEAKS: \u201cAttorney General Bill Barr, in an interview with Fox News, defended the independence and integrity of the politically contentious probe being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the handling of the Russia investigation \u2013 while taking a swipe at James Comey\u2019s past leadership of the FBI.\n\n\u201cBarr \u2026 rejected Democrats\u2019 claims he is acting as Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. \u2018That's completely wrong and there is no basis for it, and I act on behalf of the United States,\u2019 Barr said.\u201d Fox News\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

The projected economic impact of the plan could represent a tipping point that would shift biopharmaceutical R&D, manufacturing investments and jobs abroad. We do not need to blow up the pipeline for future treatments and cures to make medicines more affordable. Instead, policymakers should pursue practical policy solutions that foster continued research and development and share negotiated savings with patients at the pharmacy counter.
