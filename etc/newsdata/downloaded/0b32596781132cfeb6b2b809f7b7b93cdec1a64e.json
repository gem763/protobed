Upon entering the building, he was greeted by grinning correctional workers asking for autographs and selfies. \u201cIt was like a personal appearance,\u201d he said. But he\u2019d become accustomed to this type of thing. Even in the summer of 2018, the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Hall of Famer was legendary for the 1982 angle in which he delivered two consecutive piledrivers to comedian Andy Kaufman, \u201cbreaking\u201d his neck. Later, as a play-by-play man, he\u2019d gleefully shout the term \u201cpuppies!\u201d at buxom performers during the period known as WWE\u2019s risqu\u00e9 \u201cAttitude Era.\u201d\n\nIt was the turn of the millennium and Lawler\u2019s oldest son, Brian, was also entrenched in the family business. Presented on television as \u201cGrandmaster Sexay,\u201d Brian\u2019s in-ring gimmick involved hip-hop dancing with his partners Scotty 2 Hotty and Rikishi, a 425-pound, bleached blond member of the Samoan wrestling clan that includes Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.\n\nNearly two decades later, there was a lot of Grandmaster Sexay left in Brian. In front of the right crowd, on the right night, he could still hit a dropkick or Tennessee Jam hip-hop drop, for a big pop. But the magic was fading after a year that saw him charged with skipping out on a hotel bill, and forced to undergo facial surgery following an after-hours skirmish with another wrestler.\n\n\u201cDid you ever see the movie, The Wrestler?\u201d Lawler asked, referencing the 2008 Darren Aronofsky film in which Mickey Rourke plays a broken-down matman, battling his own vices while clinging on to past glory by wrestling in high-school gyms and VFW halls. \u201cI guess it was loosely based on Jake \u2018The Snake\u2019 Roberts. But it really fit Brian.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Lawler felt like a father struggling to choose the best course of action for a kid with substance abuse issues. It didn\u2019t matter that this particular kid was 46 years old. Brian\u2019s behavior had given Lawler every indication that his son couldn\u2019t be responsible for himself.\n\n\u201c Did you ever see the movie, 'The Wrestler'? I guess it was loosely based on Jake \u2018The Snake\u2019 Roberts. But it really fit Brian. \u201d \u2014 Jerry Lawler\n\nStill, once Lawler got inside the jail and talked to Brian, he started to feel a little better. Sheriff John Doolen joined their conversation and reminded Brian that they\u2019d met a year or so earlier, Lawler said. Brian had appeared to be driving erratically, and the lawman personally followed him home.\n\n\u201cHe asked Brian if he remembered, and he did,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cAnd the sheriff told him, \u2018That\u2019s because I care about you. Now go into the bathroom and look in the mirror.\u2019 He went into the bathroom, and he looked terrible. I was crying. Brian was crying.\u201d\n\nLawler had come to the jail to bond out his son. But now, he had second thoughts. When Brian returned to his cell, Lawler and Doolen spoke. It was pointless to bring Brian home, Lawler claims that the sheriff told him, since the younger man was scheduled for a court appearance the next week, at which time he\u2019d be sentenced to a mandatory 90 days for DUI and evading arrest. The days spent behind bars would count as time served. \u201cHe told me, \u2018This is the safest place for Brian to be because we will get him the help that he needs,\u2019\u201d Lawler said. \u201c\u2018I will personally look out for Brian. Brian will be safe in here.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo Lawler made a fateful decision: he told Doolen to leave Brian in custody.\n\n\u201cI was hoping staying in jail would mean he finally got help,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cThat\u2019s what the sheriff promised\u2014that they had a rehab program in jail.\u201d\n\nBut Brian was never treated for drug, alcohol or mental health issues at the Hardeman County Jail. On July 28, 2018, hours after allegedly getting sucker-punched in a jailhouse fight and placed in solitary, Brian was found hanging in his cell. Ever since then, Jerry has been asking questions\u2014first, whether his son was murdered behind bars and strung up to cover the crime, then, why a person with Brian\u2019s frailties was placed in a cell with bolts protruding from the wall and allowed to keep shoelaces that could be used to hurt himself.\n\nEither way, to use professional wrestling parlance, Lawler believes that Doolen\u2019s pledge to protect Brian was a \u201cwork,\u201d or a con, and on July 26th, he filed a $3-million wrongful death lawsuit against the sheriff, Hardeman County and other employees at the jail. (Neither Doolen nor his attorney, John Herron responded to requests for comment.) \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to bring Brian back,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. But it was preventable.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler was hosting a television show on Local 24, the ABC affiliate in Memphis, when he brought on Brian as his special guest. As the pair looked through old clips from the local wrestling promotion, they joked about the fact that, for the early part of Brian\u2019s career, they kept their relationship hidden. Although some attributed this to Lawler\u2019s trepidation about fans discovering that he was old enough to have a son of proper wrestling age, he told viewers that he didn\u2019t want Brian to feel the pressure to live up to his father\u2019s colossal reputation.\n\nNow, however, it was time to lay everything out in the open. \u201cThis guy right here is my son, Brian Christopher Lawler,\u201d The King boasted, looking into the camera.\n\nBrian flinched, pretending to be shocked. \u201cDid you Wikipedia me?\u201d he giggled. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\nDespite their common vocation, Jerry and Brian often had contrasting worldviews. For one thing, Jerry had never so much as tasted alcohol. And while Brian was enamored with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jerry had developed a deep fondness for the Cleveland Browns during a period when his father was transferred from Memphis to work at the Ford assembly plant in Lorain, OH.\n\n\u201cBrian told me he was watching a football game one day, and he told himself he\u2019d follow whichever team won,\u201d Jerry Lawler said. \u201cThat\u2019s how he claimed he became a Steelers fan. But I don\u2019t believe it. I think he did it to go against me, just to be rebellious.\u201d\n\nIn the \u201870s and early \u201880s, North America was divided into dozens of regional wrestling territories. There was one based in L.A., another centered in San Francisco, then another one in Portland. Each was self-contained, with its own television show, storylines and championships. While wrestlers frequently shuttled between the various groups, from the mid-70s on, Lawler was the anchor of the Memphis territory, coming to the ring with a crown and robe, and taking on every major headliner who passed through.\n\nWith ratings for the territory\u2019s Saturday morning TV show sometimes exceeding those of primetime network programs, Lawler was one of the most recognizable figures in Memphis. \u201cAs a kid, it was so cool to be in the car with him and pull into a McDonald\u2019s, and the whole place would run over to the drive-in window, going apeshit,\u201d said Kevin, Brian\u2019s younger brother.\n\nBrian and Kevin were born 10 months apart in 1972, Brian in January and Kevin in November. \u201cEvery year, after it was my birthday,\u201d Kevin remembered, \u201cwe\u2019d be the same age for two months.\u201d\n\nAfter their parents split in 1978, the brothers lived primarily with their mother, Kay. \u201cEven though Saturday morning wrestling was the biggest thing, our mom\u2019s house looked like everyone else\u2019s house,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cWe went to public school. And my father didn\u2019t live with us, so it\u2019s not like our friends would knock on the door and he\u2019d be there.\u201d\n\nIt was during visits to Jerry\u2019s house that things got interesting. In addition to wrestling, Lawler worked behind the scenes in the Memphis wrestling office, and the boys would look through his yellow notepads, feeling pangs of excitement if they found a note about an upcoming plot twist or incoming talent.\n\nEach brother shared different traits with his father. Kevin inherited Jerry\u2019s artistic ability\u2014a teenage Lawler initially drew the attention of Memphis wrestling officials when his sketches of the wrestlers were shown on the TV show\u2014and, later, his straight-edge lifestyle. Brian and Jerry were equally passionate about sports.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d play the Intellivision baseball and football games together for hours and hours and hours,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cI think that was the favorite part of Brian\u2019s life because he\u2019d have all that time with my father uninterrupted.\u201d\n\nLike most kids growing up in pro wrestling families of the era, the boys were taught to \u201cprotect the business.\u201d While traveling with their father and other wrestlers, they learned carny\u2014a form of pig Latin punctuated with z's that harked back to the days when grapplers barnstormed with the carnivals, staging \u201cworked\u201d contests to separate the \u201cmarks\u201d from their cash. If an outsider happened to walk into a room when a bunch of wrestling people were talking, they\u2019d warn each other with the term \u201ckayfabe\u201d\u2014a pronouncement to shut up and keep the marks in the dark. In the schoolyard, if another student dared to ask the real vs. fake question, wrestling kids were conditioned to respond, \u201cI can show you better than I can tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to learn from a really early age how to fight and how to fight really good,\u201d Brian told the Cult of Whatever website in 2015. \u201cPeople would say wrestling was fake, and those are fighting words to me.\u201d\n\nBrian\u2019s hero growing up was \u201cNature Boy\u201d Buddy Landel, a magnetic, arrogant heel\u2014or villain\u2014who battled Jerry at the Mid-South Coliseum. Brian would eventually wrestle Landel, and team with him in a unit called the Memphis Mafia, gushing on TV, \u201cYou know he\u2019s my idol?\u201d\n\nPerhaps not so coincidentally, Landel was a wreck away from the arena, pursued by the IRS and beset with drug issues. When Landel appeared to get his big break, a job and prospective \u201cpush\u201d with the World Wrestling Federation\u2014as WWE was then known\u2014in 1995, he slipped on ice and injured himself so badly that officials lost interest.\n\nIn 2015, he reportedly checked himself out of the hospital against doctor\u2019s orders following a major car accident. He died the next day at age 53.\n\n\u201c I had to learn from a really early age how to fight and how to fight really good. People would say wrestling was fake, and those are fighting words to me. \u201d \u2014 Brian Christopher Lawler\n\n\u201cI learned how to wrestle, sitting in the front row and watching wrestling, because I was never actually trained,\u201d Brian told Cult of Whatever. \u201cAnybody can learn to give someone a bodyslam, suplex or put someone in a figure four leglock, but I learned how to entertain the crowd\u2026 If you can make those people cheer and stand on their feet in between doing those moves, now you\u2019ve set yourself apart.\u201d\n\nAt their mother\u2019s house, the brothers formed a group called the Neighborhood Wrestling Association, whose acronym, NWA, was the same as the National Wrestling Alliance, then the most influential organization in the industry.\n\n\u201cThis was before anyone knew the term \u2018backyard wrestling,\u2019\u201d Kevin said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t backyard wrestling yet. When no adults were around, we\u2019d get everyone together. \u2018Hey, let\u2019s do a show.\u2019 The walls, the couches, the chairs were the ropes. The arms of the couches were the turnbuckles.\u201d\n\nDuring one memorable match, Brian came off the couch with an elbow, crashing into and destroying his mother\u2019s Christmas tree.\n\n\u201cKevin might have been more the booker,\u201d Jerry Lawler said, using the term for the member of a wrestling operation primarily responsible for character and story development. The teen created a detailed sketchbook of wrestling personas. \u201cThe only time I ever struck one of those guys was when Kevin got a job at a store and was fired for stealing. I remember I brought him to my house and put him against the wall and I slapped him. Then I found out he was taking lights and other material they needed for their wrestling ring.\u201d\n\nIf Jerry thought his kids were too obsessed with his profession, he did little to discourage them. On Christmas or birthdays, The King would turn up with masks and capes, created by the same seamstress who sewed his robes. \u201cThat was way cooler than Underoos,\u201d said Kevin. \u201cWe even had Spandex tights.\u201d\n\nEventually, the boys befriended a fan who sat behind them at the Mid-South Coliseum and moonlighted as a wrestler for one of the unestablished \u201coutlaw\u201d leagues. The kids learned that he had a ring on his property, enabling the Neighborhood Wrestling Association to have a new base of operation. After performing on Kay\u2019s couch, the brothers felt like they\u2019d graduated to Madison Square Garden.\n\nWhen the time was right, Brian and his friend, Tony Williams, showed a tape of one of their matches to Jerry. As Vince McMahon expanded the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to absorb the various regional territories, the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) had been started from the remnants of the Memphis and Dallas promotions. Lawler apparently thought the pair were good enough to work for the USWA\u2014but not as headliners. If the boys were going to come in, they\u2019d have to pay their dues and become \u201cjobbers,\u201d losing to the established stars.\n\n\u201cKevin was as passionate for the business as Brian,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cBut Kevin didn\u2019t look the part of a wrestler. Brian was more physically endowed. He became a bodybuilder. Unfortunately, that was the first thing that messed him up, getting involved in steroids.\n\n\u201cI mean, look what you do. You give yourself a shot. I could never give myself a shot of anything. But once you give yourself a shot of one thing, I think it\u2019s easier to give yourself a shot of something else.\u201d\n\nAlthough Lawler was still main-eventing in the USWA, Brian was one of a number of wrestling family scions trying to build a reputation there\u2014along with Jeff Jarrett, Doug and Eddie Gilbert, J.C. Ice (son of Superstar Bill Dundee) and Flex Kavana, later known as Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.\n\nJohnson remembered training and tag-teaming with Brian at flea markets and state fairs, sharing motel rooms, driving 1,500 miles a week, and eating at Waffle Houses on the road. \u201cWe would always dream (and talk shit) about once we made it to the big leagues of WWE,\u201d Johnson wrote on Instagram.\n\nBrian ascended quickly, with he and his father publicly kayfabing about their true relationship. Fans knew the flashy, young combatant as \u201cBrian Christopher.\u201d During interviews, he'd mock Jerry for being old. The two even wrestled each other.\n\n\u201cI wanted Brian to be Brian,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to be a copycat of his dad.\u201d\n\nWhen they spoke about perceptions, Lawler continuously invoked the name George Gulas, whose father, Nick, had been the promoter in Nashville. Despite George\u2019s questionable athleticism and charisma, Nick apparently insisted that his son be pushed as a star. \u201cThere was a story that George was in the ring with someone and he said, \u2018Dad says go down,\u2019\u201d Lawler said. \u201cIt was one of the reasons Nick lost his business and died broke. When I looked at that nepotism, I didn\u2019t want that for Brian. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t use the \u2018Lawler\u2019 name.\u201d\n\nOf course, everyone backstage knew about the family connection, and several of the other wrestlers resented Brian simply because his father was the King of Memphis. \u201cOh my God, he was a good worker,\u201d said Dr. Tom Prichard, who was later part of a tag team called the Bodydonnas and a trainer for WWE. \u201cBut no one was helping him. He was a cocky kid, but that was a defense mechanism because people talked behind his back. He didn\u2019t trust them.\u201d\n\n\u201c I wanted Brian to be Brian. I didn\u2019t want him to be a copycat of his dad. \u201d \u2014 Jerry Lawler\n\nIn the ring, the wrestler billed as \u201cToo Sexy\u201d Brian Christopher was sometimes hesitant to \u201csell\u201d\u2014grabbing a body part in agony to make his opponent\u2019s moves seem more powerful. \u201cHe was afraid to give away too much because he didn\u2019t know if he was going to get it back,\u201d Prichard said.\n\nBefore one match, an oldtimer told Prichard to beat Brian up and make him look weak in the ring. \u201cI went over to Brian and told him, \u2018I\u2019m not going to eat you up. Let\u2019s go out there and have a good match.\u2019 And we did. All he was looking for was someone who recognized he had talent and could take him along the journey.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, Brian\u2019s time in the USWA was among his most entertaining. Left to his own creative devices, he continuously found ways to make the fans laugh. After winning three separate championships, he wheeled his various belts to the ring in a children\u2019s wagon rather than draping the objects around him.\n\nAnother time, he staged a mock funeral for in-ring rival Doug Gilbert. \u201cDouglas Gilbert was born in the backwards, redneck town of Lexington, TN,\u201d he intoned in his faux eulogy. \u201cHe was unwanted, illegitimate\u2026 Doug was given the nickname \u2018Dangerous\u2019 when, as a child, he picked up the cigarette butt that was being used to heat their trailer\u2026 and put it in his mouth\u2026 He developed a severe spitting and slobbering problem that hampered him his entire life.\u201d\n\nWith the crowd hooting with a mixture of derision and mirth, Brian then described Doug\u2019s father, Tommy, as a \u201cjabroni\u201d who \u201cnever drew a single red cent in his entire wrestling career\u2014and Doug Gilbert followed in his father\u2019s footsteps.\u201d\n\nIn time, the USWA became a developmental league for the World Wrestling Federation\u2014the company's name was changed to World Wrestling Entertainment in 2002, following a lawsuit with the World Wildlife Fund. In 1997, Brian was called up to the main roster, and promptly won the WWF Light-Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAt the announcer's table, Jerry \u201cThe King\u201d Lawler would rave about the young performer, referring to his good looks and abnormal abilities. When broadcast partner, Jim \u201cJ.R.\u201d Ross would observe that the two seemed to have an unusual connection, Lawler became indignant, insisting, \u201cThere's only one set of The King's DNA.\u201d\n\nAt one point, as part of a storyline centered around Philadelphia's renegade Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) invading the WWF, the company's owner, Paul Heyman, shrieked that Brian Christopher was Jerry Lawler's son. \u201cI was a little pissed off,\u201d Jerry said. \u201cYou don't break kayfabe.\u201d\n\nBut the WWF was in the midst of a boom period, and the talent there seemed happy. The Rock had been on the roster for a year when Brian arrived, and the two picked up where they left off in Memphis, competing in Madden NFL tournaments in their shared hotel room, and playing Wiffle Ball in the parking lot late at night after their matches. \u201cOur jaws would hurt from laughing so hard,\u201d the future action hero recalled. Part of their chemistry was based on the fact that their families knew each other from the days when The Rock's father, Rocky \u201cSoulman\u201d Johnson, would pass through Memphis with his wife, Ata\u2014daughter of Samoan superstar, High Chief Peter Maivia.\n\nBut the trajectories of the two Lawler brothers, once so close, were starting to diverge. Although Kevin Lawler worked as a referee in USWA, occasionally wrestled under a mask and, at one point, played the role of Doug and Eddie Gilbert's manager-brother, Freddie Gilbert in an early incarnation of ECW, Brian was in an entirely different stratosphere. \u201cI felt like we were in high school, and everyone else graduated, but I got held back,\u201d Kevin said.\n\nIn 1998, \u201cToo Sexy\u201d Brian Christopher and \u201cToo Hot\u201d Scott Taylor were marketed as Too Much. The next year, the hulking Samoan grappler, Rikishi joined the unit. The company changed the name of the team to Too Cool, as well as Brian and Scott\u2019s monikers to Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty. Brian often came to the ring wearing a doo rag held in place with goggles\u2014which he used while going airborne from the turnbuckles \u2014dancing with his partners to flashing lights.\n\nThe fans were not expected to cheer them. \u201cWe were supposed to be doing a spoof... on hip-hop and making fun of it,\u201d Brian told Cult of Whatever. \u201cBut the fans started enjoying it... They loved the fact it was two white boys out there dancing. Then, when they threw Rikishi into the mix, that only heightened everything because now, we've got a 400-pound Samoan... wearing a thong with his huge ass showing... but he can dance as well.\u201d\n\nThe team peaked in 2000 when Rikishi won the WWF Intercontinental Championship, while Scotty 2 Hotty and Grandmaster Sexay captured the tag team titles. With names like The Rock, Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Mick Foley and Triple H at the top of the cards, Too Cool was an attraction that always got a pop from the crowd during the opening matches.\n\nBut there was a side of Brian Christopher that the fans didn't see.\n\n\u201cBrian had been diagnosed with a major depression disorder,\u201d Jerry Lawler's lawyer, Jeffrey S. Rosenblum said. \u201cThe Brian you saw on television worked hard to be that Brian because he was managing depression.\u201d\n\nKevin theorized that his brother may have always been bipolar. \u201cHis personality would go from zero to 100 and back again.\u201d\n\nWhile touring with the WWF, Lawler said, his son became a drug user. \u201cHe said it started when he walked into the dressing room and a tag team was doing coke, and they made him do it with them so he wouldn't tell.\u201d\n\n\u201c His mom was crying. His wife was crying. And he was shaking his head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s so bad.\u2019 He didn\u2019t think he had a problem. \u201d \u2014 Jerry Lawler\n\nWhether or not Brian's tale was true, drugs became a part of his lifestyle. In 2001, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested him for attempting to pass through Calgary International Airport with methamphetamine and cocaine. He pleaded guilty to one charge of cocaine possession, while the other charge was dropped. In exchange for making a donation for a teen drug and alcohol program, he received a conditional discharge, allowing him to continue to work in Canada.\n\n\u201cHe caught a big break on that,\u201d Jerry Lawler was quoted as saying at the time.\n\nThe WWF was not as forgiving, firing Brian for causing an issue at the border.\n\nYet, Brian seemed so confident that everything was going to be OK that his brother Kevin was not as concerned as he should have been. \u201cI wasn't even sure if he had a problem. I thought, 'This is stuff he got into, and maybe he'll learn not to mess up again.'\u201d\n\nBrian bounced around. He used his WWF tenure to market himself as a main attraction in indie promotions unaffiliated with any major wrestling group. In 2002, he performed for Total Nonstop Action (TNA)\u2014a company that was then attempting to compete with WWE\u2014as Brian Lawler, heading a unit labeled \u201cNext Generation\u201d alongside David Flair and Erik Watts, the sons of \u201cNature Boy\u201d Ric Flair and Cowboy Bill Watts, respectively. He was brought back as Grandmaster Sexay to WWE in 2004, but only lasted four matches.\n\nAt one point, Brian\u2019s wife, Davah, attempted to stage an intervention. \u201cIt was like having a surprise birthday party for someone who didn\u2019t like birthday parties,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cHis mom was crying. His wife was crying. And he was shaking his head, like, \u2018I don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s so bad.\u2019 He didn\u2019t think he had a problem.\u201d\n\nDespite his ability to double talk and charm, it was obvious Brian was struggling. In 2009, he was arrested three times\u2014for disorderly conduct, failing to attend an in-patient program as part of a plea agreement, and public intoxication. (In that case, police claimed he threatened the officer who took him into custody.)\n\nFollowing a spate of early deaths by members of the wrestling fraternity, WWE had instituted a wellness policy in 2006, prohibiting its current performers from abusing prescription and performance enhancing drugs, and providing rehab for any athlete who\u2019d ever been on the promotion\u2019s roster. Feeling the pressure from family and friends, Brian registered for the program twice.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d go just to shut everybody up,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cAnd he was thinking if he went, maybe WWE would give him his job back. There was never any commitment.\u201d\n\n\u201c I\u2019d start to think, \u2018Well, maybe he\u2019s getting a little better.' There\u2019d be patches when you could be around him and he wouldn\u2019t seem bad. \u201d \u2014 Kevin Lawler\n\nJerry also spent thousands of dollars on treatment for his son. Nothing appeared to work. \u201cHe left one program because the Steelers game was on and they weren\u2019t showing it at the rehab center,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t sinking in. He told me, \u2018I\u2019ve been through this too many times. Rehab doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a guy who had $300,000 in the bank, a beautiful house, a beautiful wife, a child, and he lost everything one by one. He couldn\u2019t understand why everyone was so concerned about him.\u201d\n\nYet, there were times when Brian showed up at an indie show, looking fit, moving smoothly in the ring and offering sensible advice to the younger wrestlers. \u201cI\u2019d start to think, \u2018Well, maybe he\u2019s getting a little better,\u2019\u201d Kevin said. \u201cThere\u2019d be patches when you could be around him and he wouldn\u2019t seem bad.\u201d\n\nOn a few occasions, WWE brought in Brian as a one-off. The year after Jerry and Brian publicly joked about their familial relationship on Local 24 in Memphis, a bleached blond Brian appeared on the promotion\u2019s flagship show, Monday Night Raw, to side with his father\u2019s rival at the time, his announcing partner Michael Cole. \u201cI never, ever felt like I had a father,\u201d Brian told the crowd, as part of the storyline. \u201cWhile Jerry Lawler was traveling the world, being The King, he neglected one thing. Me!\u201d\n\nIn a moment that seemed a little too real, Lawler replied, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one that\u2019s glad you didn\u2019t use the Lawler name. Because, you see, Brian, you\u2019re a bigger screw-up than Charlie Sheen.\u201d\n\nA more uplifting sequence occurred three years later, when all three members of Too Cool reunited for the first time in 13 years as part of a special \u201cold school\u201d edition of Monday Night Raw, defeating the trio of Drew McIntyre, Heath Slater and Jinder Mahal.\n\nIn 2016, Brian appeared clear-eyed and positive in a video with Rikishi at a Waffle House, following an indie show in Corinth, Mississippi. Describing his preferred meal as a \u201cbodybuilder\u2019s special\u201d consisting of chunked chicken, egg whites and steamed hash browns, a smiling Brian evangelized about his menu choice, motioning at Rikishi\u2019s plate and playfully asking the waitress, \u201cCould you chunk his chicken?\u201d\n\nObserved Kevin, \u201cYou do an indie show in a small town and the people don\u2019t know you\u2019re flat broke. They\u2019re cheering you, taking your picture. And then\u2014boom\u2014you leave and you\u2019re stuck in the same situation you were in before, with the same bad feelings.\u201d\n\nThe year 2018 started badly for Brian. In January, his beloved maternal grandfather died. In the early morning hours of Feb. 18, police found Brian in an Evansville, Indiana, hotel lobby, his face so bloody and swollen he was unrecognizable. Upstairs, officers encountered fellow wrestler and traveling companion Chase Stevens standing next to a blood-splattered wall and sheets. The room\u2019s trash can also contained blood and tissue.\n\nPolice took Stevens into custody. He said Brian had caused a scene in a nightclub and refused to sleep on the hotel room floor. (Brian maintained that his roommate mistakenly believed that Grandmaster Sexay was hitting on the man\u2019s girlfriend.) Although he conceded that he\u2019d punched Brian twice in the face, Stevens insisted that he was only acting in self-defense.\n\n\u201cThe physician reported that [Brian] Lawler had several broken bones in his face, broken teeth and that surgery was required,\u201d the police report read.\n\nThen, in March, Jerry Lawler suffered a stroke. He recovered fast enough to resume his commentating duties at WrestleMania 34 three weeks later. But Kevin noted that Brian was shaken by his father\u2019s health scare.\n\n\"Everything compiled,\u201d Kevin said.\n\nAnd nothing was getting better. In June, Brian and a friend were arrested at a Memphis Hampton Inn after the credit card they presented couldn\u2019t cover the $802.32 bill.\n\nIt was obvious that this pattern was going to be repeated. Still, the family now wonders whether, on the particular day that Brian died, he should have been in jail at all.\n\nIt was July 7 when Sgt. Chris Wilkerson of the Hardeman County Sheriff\u2019s Department said he noticed a vehicle traveling south on Highway 1255 at speeds above the posted limit, before turning onto the road where Brian lived in Middleton, TN, about an hour east of Memphis. \u201cThis vehicle failed to maintain proper lane control,\u201d the police report said, \u201ccrossing the yellow line with both left tires three times.\u201d\n\nWhen Wilkinson attempted to conduct a traffic stop, he said that Brian kept going, making a left onto his driveway. After Wilkerson caught up with him, \u201cMr. Lawler had the odor of an intoxicant about his person and an open 12 ounce can in the center console,\u201d the report said. A Standard Field Sobriety Test, according to the document, suggested that Brian was impaired.\n\nBut Brian would tell his father and brother another version of the incident, insisting that, on this night, he hadn\u2019t been drinking at all. Because of this, he claimed, he made a deal with this sergeant:\n\n\u201cGive me a Breathalyzer and if I blow a zero, I can go home.\u201d\n\nThe police report states that Brian blew a .000 per 210 litres of breath.\n\nRegardless, he was taken to the Hardeman County Jail and charged with DUI, evading arrest and driving with a revoked license. As he was being booked, Brian told his father, one of the other deputies leaned in and motioned at Wilkerson. \u201cYou know how your father is the King of Wrestling?\u201d the officer allegedly asked. \u201cWell, that guy over there is the King of DUIs. When you get a DUI from him, he makes it stick.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation\u2019s toxicology report would determine that \u201cno basic drugs\u201d had been detected in Brian\u2019s bloodstream. However, there were traces of oxycodone and oxymorphone. Lawler\u2019s lawyer, Rosenblum, attributed this to Brian\u2019s legal medications for chronic pain, a knee injury, anxiety and depression.\n\nThe attorney described the amount of opiates as \u201cat most, consistent with what you would expect in a person who was taking medication prescribed by a doctor.\u201d\n\nBrian had only drifted over the yellow line, he told authorities, because he happened to be driving with his knee at that particular time.\n\nWas that enough to put a man in jail? \u201cTechnically, he never should have been there,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cIt\u2019s like The Dukes of Hazzard. The cops see him constantly getting out of stuff, and they\u2019re looking to put him away.\u201d\n\nDuring intake, according to the lawsuit, Brian mentioned his conditions, and said that he\u2019d attempted suicide in 2013 and 2015. \u201cDespite Brian\u2019s statement regarding his prior suicide attempts,\u201d the document said, \u201cthe Jail\u2019s computer system automatically changed the positive response to a negative response because his suicide attempts happened more than two years before this incarceration.\u201d Although mental health professionals visited the facility while Brian was there, the lawsuit states, none stopped to evaluate him.\n\nBehind bars, Brian was able to receive his medication for depression, but just Ibuprofen for his chronic pain, Rosenblum said. For three weeks, the lawyer claimed, Brian was denied his other medications, and was experiencing withdrawal when he walked into the day room on Saturday, July 28, 2018.\n\n\u201cOne of his friends told me that the other guys were saying, \u2018Your dad\u2019s never coming to get you,\u2019 just fucking with him every day,\u201d Kevin said.\n\nBrian was playing cards when one particular inmate, Tommarian Williams, incarcerated on a parole violation, apparently demanded that he lower his voice. Punches were thrown. \u201cBrian\u2019s famous for this,\u201d Lawler said. \u201cBrian would fight.\u201d\n\nIn the fracas, Brian applied a reverse chinlock on Williams, and was backed into the wall, witnesses said, while the wrestler\u2019s government-issued, draw-stringed orange pants slipped down. According to the accounts, Williams eventually shouted for Brian to stop. When he did, Brian bent forward to catch his breath and pull up his pants. That\u2019s when other inmates said Williams slugged Brian, leaving a one-and-a-half-inch gash alongside his left eyebrow.\n\nRosenblum said that Brian shouted that he had a concussion and needed stitches, and asked to be taken to the hospital. Instead, Jill Shearon, a licensed practical nurse (LPN), applied a bandage before Brian was placed alone in an administrative holding cell, according to the attorney.\n\n\u201cThat is not a decision that should be made by an LPN,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cShe should have called a doctor or advanced practice nurse, described the wound and mentioned that he wanted stitches. But he was told, \u2018It\u2019s Saturday. You\u2019ll have to wait until Monday.\u2019 He was put in a solitary confinement cell without evaluating him for suicide risk.\u201d\n\nIn the cell was a concrete bench, above which were \u201cnumerous large bolts protruding from the upper portion of the wall,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cBrian, an inmate with known suicide attempts, major depressive mood disorder, withdrawal pain and a head injury,\u201d the lawsuit continued, had been put there without anyone bothering to remove the shoelaces from his sneakers.\n\nKevin has tried to imagine his brother\u2019s frame of mind in jail. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018Man, the one time I really wasn\u2019t breaking the law, I\u2019m in this situation.\u2019 He got beat up. He felt shame. He wanted medical help, and they probably thought, \u2018He\u2019s one of those fake wrestlers. He\u2019s not really hurt.\u2019\u201d\n\nBecause the video surveillance system at the jail didn\u2019t properly work, Rosenblum said, no one knows exactly what transpired while Brian was alone in his cell. At approximately 6:30 PM, correctional officer William Gonzalez walked by the chamber and, according to the lawsuit, observed Brian standing on the bench with a towel over his face. Said Rosenblum, \u201cIf he was standing on the bench, he hadn\u2019t stepped off yet. If you got him 30 seconds earlier, he would have lived.\u201d\n\nGonzalez left to throw out the garbage, the lawsuit said. When he returned, he saw \u201cwhat he still thought was Brian standing on a bench\u2026 with a towel over his head.\u201d Gonzalez called Sgt. Judy Wiggins for assistance. They realized that Brian had tried to hang himself.\n\nStill alive, Brian was air lifted to Regional One Medical Center in Memphis. \u201cMy dad called me and said, \u2018Brian hung himself in jail, but he still has a pulse and he\u2019s breathing,\u2019\u201d Kevin said. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018OK. Here\u2019s some more crazy shit that Brian kicks out of.\u2019 \u2018Hey, you idiot. What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut this time, it was no near-fall. At 3:49 PM on July 29, 2018, with his father watching, Brian was pronounced dead of anoxic encephalopathy.\n\nInstinctively, Lawler snapped a photo of his son\u2019s lifeless body and texted it to Sheriff Doolen. \u201cI told him, \u2018I trusted you and believed you when you told me my son would be safe in your jail, and now, he\u2019s dead,\u2019\u201d Lawler said. \u201cDoolen texted back, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHurts my heart to know how Brian decided to check out,\u201d The Rock posted on Instagram. \u201cI never knew him to be suicidal, but I guess sometimes the pain gets too much for one to take. I\u2019ll miss you, man, and the times we had. Thanks for being a great friend. Thanks for being my boy.\u201d\n\n\u201c So I thought, \u2018Okay. Here\u2019s some more crazy shit that Brian kicks out of.\u2019 \u2018Hey, you idiot. What were you thinking?\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Kevin Lawler\n\nJerry Lawler was initially cynical about the notion that his son had taken his own life. He suspected that Brian had been killed in a fight, and hung to cover up the assault. His theory was based on more than paranoia. In the photo taken at the hospital, Brian was wearing an oxygen mask while brown marks came around the back of his head and the sides of his neck, stopping just before the throat area. \u201cTo Jerry, the space at the front of the neck looked to be the size of a fist,\u201d Rosenblum said. \u201cSo Jerry questioned whether Brian was fighting while others were trying to strangle him.\u201d\n\nBut even after Rosenblum ran several tests to verify that Brian could have killed himself with the materials available in his cell, Jerry remains uncertain.\n\nOn the one-year anniversary of Brian\u2019s death, Lawler and his attorney held a press conference, announcing the wrongful death lawsuit, and accusing the sheriff and the county of, \u201cat minimum,\u201d negligence for failing to recognize that they\u2019d placed a vulnerable inmate in danger.\n\nEarlier in the month, Doolen had sued Hardeman County Mayor Jimmy Sain, claiming that the department was understaffed, and that seven of the jail\u2019s 27 employees were paid so poorly that they had no choice but to go on public assistance. That, and the county\u2019s broken equipment, the sheriff said, put both his staff and the public\u2019s safety at risk.\n\nApprised of that lawsuit, Lawler speculated whether the sheriff was somehow attempting to explain the circumstances that led to Brian\u2019s demise.\n\n\u201cAnytime someone dies of suicide, as a parent, you ask yourself, \u2018Is there anything I could have done differently that would have saved him?\u2019\u201d Lawler said. \u201cI go through it every day. I wish I could give other parents advice to make things better. But it can\u2019t be better because Brian\u2019s not here.\u201d\n\nKevin finds himself feeling the same type of bereavement. \u201cEven with my dad being who he was, we were still normal,\u201d he lamented, placing his brother\u2019s death on the long list of wrestling heartbreaks. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d be another wrestling tragedy. Now, we\u2019re one of those.\u201d\n\nWhile Brian was alive, Kevin didn't think they resembled one another. Since Brian\u2019s death, though, he said \u201cthere are times I\u2019m walking somewhere and I catch myself in the mirror and I see him.\u201d\n\nThere, on the other side of the glass, is Grandmaster Sexay, his grin wild, his eyes sparkling with mischief.\n\n\u201cHe never wanted to be old,\u201d Kevin said, remembering Brian the performer. \u201cHe never wanted to be a shell of himself. He always wanted to leave the people wanting more.\u201d\n\nIf you or a loved one are struggling with suicidal thoughts, please reach out to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741\n\nKEITH ELLIOT GREENBERG is a New York Times bestselling author who co-wrote the autobiographies of WWE Hall of Famers Ric Flair, Freddie Blassie and Superstar Billy Graham, as well as the third edition of the WWE Encyclopedia of Sports Entertainment.
