Whenever I\u2019d go to the rural I\u2019d meet some of the smartest kids and find out that most of them have never met a successful person or all they want to be is being a teacher or a nurse- so what I do is invite influential people to motivate the learners both high school and varsity students\u201d.\n\nMtolo told DRUM that this programme is not funded.\n\n\u201cThis programme is funded by myself because a lot of the time when you are funded by brands, they tend not to communicate your programme the way you want them to or they tend to taint the image that you have for your brand so for now, I fund it\u201d.\n\n\u201cI want my story to inspire someone, and my long-term goal for the programme is have high school tours and just inspire everyone. My wife is the backbone of what I do, I love her so much and I\u2019d like to thank her for the support.", "description": "Bongani Mtolo who left his everyday job to pursue his passion started an initiative where he helps high school and varsity kids to meet local celebs.", "authors": ["Nolusindiso Mgujulwa"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9483/c3262fcd9dc443969cbaf6e5bafb7bde.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
