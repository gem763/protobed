According to the lawsuit, Musk and SpaceX also demanded an apology from the government of Thailand over comments made by officials \u2014 while the trapped soccer team was still awaiting rescue from the cave.\n\nBuzzFeed News reports that in recently released court documents, the British cave rescuer who Elon Musk accused of being a \u201cpedo guy\u201d has hit back at the Tesla CEO accusing him of purposefully defaming him and orchestrating \u201ca malicious, false, and anonymous leak campaign in the UK and Australian press\u201d intended to destroy his reputation.\n\nIn July of 2018, Unsworth called Musk\u2019s plan to rescue a group of Thai teenagers from an underwater cave using a miniature submarine a \u201cPR stunt\u201d and stated his belief that the submarine would have failed completely to make it through the tight, narrow bends in the underwater cave. \u201cHe can stick his submarine where it hurts,\u201d Unsworth said in an interview. \u201cIt had absolutely no chance of working. He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn\u2019t have gone round corners or round any obstacles. It wouldn\u2019t have made the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point. Just a PR stunt.\u201d\n\nMusk claimed that his submarine could easily have navigated the cave, telling Unsworth in a now-deleted tweet: \u201cYou know what, don\u2019t bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo. Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.\u201d\n\nIn court filings, Unsworthj stated that Musk was \u201ca thin-skinned billionaire\u201d with \u201ca history of vindictively and intentionally ignoring truth,\u201d and argued that Musk knew his allegations of pedophilia against Unsworth were false.\n\nMusk hired a private investigator who was a convicted felon to investigate Unsworth who provided little evidence to back up Musk\u2019s claims about Unsworth. Unsworth is now seeking $75,000 in damages an unspecified punitive damages to be determined by a court. Unsworth\u2019s filing stated that Musk\u2019s statements made in depositions and court documents were \u201creplete with untruths and misrepresentations\u201d and contain a number of embarrassing revelations collected in discovery.\n\nIn an email to PR consultant Juleanna Glover on September 4, 2018, Musk stated that he was a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d for emailing a BuzzFeed News reporter with a number of unverified claims about Unsworth which he urged the reporter to investigate. In the emails, Musk claims that Unsworth was a \u201cchild rapist\u201d who took \u201ca child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\u201d\n\nIn the email to Glover, Musk stated that he hoped providing the reporter with the unverified information would lead them to \u201cinvestigate and come to their own conclusions\u201d and \u201cnot publish my email directly.\u201d\n\nUnsworth\u2019s lawyers write: \u201cOn August 24, 27, and 30, Musk received separate written reports stating that Unsworth met [his partner] when she was at least 18 or 19 years old (and married her some years after that) \u2013 but less than 8 hours after getting the last such report, Musk nonetheless told the BuzzFeed reporter that Unsworth is a child rapist who married a 12-year-old child bride.\u201d\n\nThe court filing also notes that: \u201cOn July 10th, before the Boys were all rescued, Musk and members of his team that were supposed to be engaged in developing the Tube were instead enlisting the Thai government (including the Thai Prime Minister) to publicly reverse a statement by the Thai regional governor\u2019s statement that the Tube was not practical and did not fit the mission.\u201d\n\nThe full court documents claim that Sam Teller, the director of the office of the CEO for Tesla and SpaceX, who functions essentially as Musk\u2019s chief of staff, referred to the former Thai regional governor as an \u201cungrateful asshole\u201d and attempted to craft statements that would then be issued to the Thai government and then be said publicly by Thai officials. \u201cPM should say SpaceX is awsome. Engineers helpful. Pod not necessary because this went well but it\u2019s a useful and cool design.\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that the boys are still stuck in the cave, Teller is Elon's chief of staff, and Davis is the president of the Boring Co and a SpaceX engineer. Read the entire thing. Amazing. $TSLAQ pic.twitter.com/BnSrtKKjhZ \u2014 TeslaCharts (@TESLAcharts) October 8, 2019\n\nIn a recent deposition, Musk discussed the submarine rescue attempt stating \u201cI can see how this would look like a \u2018narcissistic PR stunt.\u2019\u201d\n\nUpdate \u2014 A spokesperson for Elon Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro of firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, LLP, contacted Breitbart News with this statement: \u201cThis case is nothing but a money-grab in which Unsworth has hired an agent and pursued profit, publicity and self-promotion at every turn. The truth of his motivations and actions will come out soon enough.\u201d\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
