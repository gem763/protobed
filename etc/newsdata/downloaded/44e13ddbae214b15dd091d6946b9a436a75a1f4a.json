She also talked about being diagnosed with depression during her six-year hiatus from Hollywood and is sure to get the rumor mill going by referencing an ex-boyfriend of hers who is gay.\n\nThe Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary actress, who portrays Judy Garland in the new biopic Judy, talked about the big to-do over her appearance \u2014 and whether she altered it \u2014 in 2014 at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards, which led to her penning an essay for HuffPost entitled \u201cWe Can Do Better.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a value judgment that\u2019s placed on us,\u201d Zellweger said. \u201cAs if it somehow is a reflection of your character \u2014 whether you\u2019re a good person or a weak person or an authentic person.\u201d\n\nThe star, who was on a self-imposed hiatus from Hollywood at the time of the kerfuffle, went on to say that \u201cthe implication\u201d was that \u201cI somehow needed to change what was going on because it wasn\u2019t working. That makes me sad. I don\u2019t look at beauty in that way. And I don\u2019t think of myself in that way. I like my weird quirkiness, my off-kilter mix of things. It enables me to do what I do. I don\u2019t want to be something else. I got hired in my blue jeans and cowboy boots with my messy hair. I started working like that. I didn\u2019t have to change to work. So why was I suddenly trying to fit into some mold that didn\u2019t belong to me?\u201d\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger at the 2019 Academy Awards.

That\u2019s because, in a class-action lawsuit filed last year, actress Melissa Sagemiller claimed that Weinstein had told her that he\u2019d received \u201csexual favors\u201d from Zellweger and Charlize Theron. Through her rep at the time, Zellweger said, \u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of sh**.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to talk about in this context,\u201d Zellweger said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a big topic. And it\u2019s personal and it\u2019s not. And it\u2019s something that\u2019s always been there and the shift is overdue and you could feel it coming for a while and it was inevitable. And thank God. But, in some ways, I feel: Oh gosh, I allowed for the tiny cuts that just seemed like, \u2018Oh, this is just how it\u2019s always been.\u2019 But I was never a victim of it.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI always felt that I knew what to do in those circumstances. I didn\u2019t feel \u2026 accostable. I never felt that I was being insulted, demeaned. I didn\u2019t recognize it as that. It was jocular \u2014 it\u2019s a joke. And then there\u2019s that other side of it: that I love male-female banter, that playful dynamic. So, it\u2019s a big conversation. I\u2019m sure that I was on the receiving end of something that I don\u2019t even know about, in conversations that I wasn\u2019t privy to. But it wasn\u2019t something that I felt, it wasn\u2019t something that I was aware of. I was very surprised by some of the things that were unearthed. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nZellweger again discussed her hiatus from Hollywood, during which found herself again by taking classes and living an authentic life out of the limelight. She said the time was \u201cimportant\u201d to her \u2014 and it led to self-discoveries, including her therapist diagnosing her with depression.\n\n\u201cHe recognized that I spent 99 percent of my life as the public persona and just a microscopic crumb of a fraction in my real life,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to not have something to do all the time, to not know what I\u2019m going to be doing for the next two years in advance. I wanted to allow for some accidents. There had to be some quiet for the ideas to slip in.\u201d\n\nThanks to that therapist, she came to the realization that she was depressed, she said.", "description": "From plastic surgery to Harvey Weinstein, no topic was off-limits in Renee Zellweger's new interview with Vulture.", "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rfSg6jgu.ZQ7.3wvr0I_5A--~B/aD0yOTc4O3c9NDQ3NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ced232f0-ce6d-11e9-bff7-f950468093cf"}
