Wars. Overworking. Unnecessary meetings. And just flat out being broke. These are some of the reasons why millennials aren\u2019t planning for much of a retirement.\n\nTwitter TWTR, +1.12% erupted with suggestions as to how this young generation could spend their old age, using the hashtag #millennialretirementplans, on Tuesday morning. More of the tweets were pessimistic, but some made light of their situations. A few said they\u2019d continue to live in their parents\u2019 basements, while another person said she\u2019d fund her retirement with Go Fund Me, a crowdsourcing website where people can ask others for donations. Someone else said she\u2019d have enough experience to get an entry-level job by then.\n\nHope we don't die in our chairs during a meeting that could have been an email.#MillennialRetirementPlans \u2014 Liz (@elizlipp) September 17, 2019\n\nWatch as the environment disintegrates and move to Mars, where we will yet again, destroy another planet. #millennialretirementplans pic.twitter.com/nrhreTinAZ \u2014 lamegirlblues (@lamegirlblues) September 17, 2019\n\n#MillennialRetirementPlans\n\nWhy is this even on trending?

One Twitter user said she\u2019ll never retire because she needs her employer-sponsored health insurance to pay for the insulin she needs to \u201cstay alive.\u201d Another person said she could move to a country that provides basic health care to its citizens, which is not available in the U.S. (but has been discussed at length in the Democratic debates under \u201cMedicare for All\u201d). Someone else suggested they may die before age 40 because of medical complications uncared for because of expensive treatments.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time millennials\u2019 retirements were a trending topic on Twitter. In May 2018, Twitter blew up with tweets about how much money people should have saved for retirement by age 35, after a MarketWatch story about saving for retirement in your 30s went viral. The story included guidance from Fidelity Investments, suggesting Americans should have twice their salary saved for retirement by 35. Soon after, the hashtags \u201cby 35\u201d and \u201cby age 35\u201d were born \u2014 some angry and defensive, others poking fun.\n\nRead: How one millennial managed to save almost $1 million without ever earning a salary over $75,000\n\nRetirement savings guidelines may upset those who feel they can\u2019t get ahead, and while many young people may find it hard to envision retiring, saving for the future is imperative \u2014 no matter how much, or little, they put away each month. Saving for retirement isn\u2019t what it used to be. Most private sector employers have switched from defined-benefit plans, which are pensions, to defined-contribution plans, like the 401(k), which places the responsibility on employees to save enough.\n\nMillennials cite numerous reasons they can\u2019t save for retirement, including debilitating student loan debt, low incomes, high rents and mortgage payments and familial responsibilities to their children and parents. Financial advisers typically suggest Americans save 10% to 15% of their salary for retirement. If that\u2019s not possible \u2014 and for many, it isn\u2019t \u2014 there are other strategies, including at minimum meeting whatever the employer 401(k) match is, so that they get some \u201cfree money,\u201d and combing through credit card and bank statements to see if there are any expenses that can be cut or eliminated, like an unused subscription to a magazine or happy hours that don\u2019t actually bring joy.", "description": "Wishing for early death?
