Bless him, he just never learnt when he was younger and it\u2019s so hard to teach an adult.\u201d\n\nDearing does not linger on this thought, despite being the only black swimmer on the British team at present and the second ever to swim competitively for Great Britain. Amid juggling a masters degree in social media and political communication at Loughborough University with the aim of competing in the women\u2019s 10km race at Tokyo 2020, the 22-year-old is on a wider mission to quash a stereotype that has long dogged her sport: that black people can\u2019t swim.\n\nIt was not growing up in the multiculturally diverse suburb of Aldbury, Birmingham - a stone\u2019s throw away from where the pool for the 2022 Commonwealth Games is being built - which blurred Dearing\u2019s early understanding of her own ethnicity, but in her local pool.\n\n\u201cIt sounds bad, but I\u2019ve always seen myself as white because I\u2019m always surrounded by white people and swimming is a white sport. Am I white? I\u2019m not, but I was quite blinded by it,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised that a lot of people didn\u2019t see me the way I saw myself. I didn\u2019t really see colour for a while until a few things happened along the way.\u201d", "description": "It is around halfway in our interview when Alice Dearing casually drops it into conversation.", "authors": ["Fiona Tomas", "James Corrigan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/swimming/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000207022924-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
