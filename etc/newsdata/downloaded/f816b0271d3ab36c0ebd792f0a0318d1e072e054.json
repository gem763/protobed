Photo: Mason Trinca/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe mutual acrimony between Donald Trump and America\u2019s largest state escalated during his fundraising trip to California this week (much as POTUS hates the Golden State, he cannot do without the milk and honey supplied by its wealthy Republican donors). As he prepared to board Air Force One to leave the state, he offered this obnoxious little stink bomb of a parting shot, NBC News reports:\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to have the Environmental Protection Agency issue a \u201cnotice\u201d to San Francisco over the city\u2019s homeless issue, comments that were criticized by local officials.\n\nFrom Air Force One, Trump, who had been in California for a two-day fundraising trip, blamed the homeless population for environmental issues. \u201cThere\u2019s tremendous pollution being put into the ocean,\u201d he said, noting \u201cthere are needles, there are other things.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco \u2014 they\u2019re in total violation \u2014 we\u2019re going to be giving them the notice very soon,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThe EPA is going to be putting out a notice and you know they\u2019re in serious violation and this is environmental, very environmental,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they have to clean it up. We can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cenvironmental, very environmental\u201d emphasis is ironic since he signaled while visiting California that he will, as expected, trigger a legal battle to end the state\u2019s power to impose tough emissions standards on automobiles. But his remarks did put an appropriately crude exclamation point on his administration\u2019s recent unfriendly interest in California\u2019s homelessness problem. And local officials, including San Francisco\u2019s mayor, reacted as you might expect:\n\nIf the President wants to talk about homelessness, we are committed to working on actual solutions, like adding 1,000 new shelter beds by next year and working to pass a $600 million affordable housing bond to create more badly needed housing. \u2014 London Breed (@LondonBreed) September 19, 2019\n\nThis wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first comment on the homeless during this trip. Earlier he suggested California\u2019s homeless were making life unpleasant for, well, people like him, as Conor Dougherty noted:\n\n[A]s the president jetted off to the Bay Area on Tuesday for a fund-raiser, he took a moment with reporters on Air Force One to fulminate against \u201cpeople living in our best highways, our best streets, our best entrances to buildings \u2026\u201d\n\nFor all of his talk of homelessness, Mr. Trump indicated to reporters that his sympathies rested with the taxpayers, rich immigrants and business leaders forced to wade through California\u2019s urban detritus.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, they came from other countries and they moved to Los Angeles or they moved to San Francisco because of the prestige of the city, and all of a sudden they have tents,\u201d Mr. Trump exclaimed to reporters before disappearing behind the cloistered mansions of Silicon Valley. \u201cHundreds and hundreds of tents and people living at the entrance to their office building. And they want to leave.\u201d\n\nIn another bit of interesting timing, HUD Secretary Ben Carson toured homeless encampments in Los Angeles yesterday, even as he rejected a request from California governor Gavin Newsom for additional housing vouchers and other assistance in a letter lecturing state and local officials for trying to \u201cspend its way out of this problem using Federal funds.\u201d Echoing a Council of Economic Advisors white paper on homelessness the White House released earlier this week, Carson is blaming the problem entirely on state and local overregulation of housing. To California Democratic lawmakers who have been working on the welter of issues affected by the housing supply, the administration\u2019s advice is simplistic at best, as the Los Angeles Times reports:\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, who has made a name for himself arguing for the reduction of local zoning rules, said he disagreed with the Trump administration\u2019s apparent pitch to cut back on all regulations and allow for more building of all types everywhere. Instead, his recently shelved Senate Bill 50 was designed to make it easier to build housing near existing job centers and mass transit specifically for affordability and environmental reasons \u2026\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with the president\u2019s view that we should be like Arizona because that would lead to sprawl,\u201d Wiener said. \u201cBut I do agree with Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Barack Obama that we should move away from restrictive housing policies because restrictive housing policies lead to more homelessness.\u201d\n\nIn separate comments, Wiener spoke more bluntly of the president as a \u201cslumlord who has spent his presidency pushing people into homelessness by taking away health care, food assistance and affordable housing funds.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the administration\u2019s agitation of the air on homelessness will lead to any concrete actions, though there has been ominous muttering about using law-enforcement resources to clear the streets and sidewalks and perhaps force the homeless into federal facilities.\n\nThe odds are pretty good that this sudden interest in California homelessness is just another Trump rhetorical ploy that will lead to rants before red-state audiences about liberal hellholes that encourage riffraff to move in and threaten law-abiding citizens like themselves. In his war with California, it\u2019s just one of many skirmishes.", "description": "During a fundraising trip to California, President Trump castigated the Democratic state and local officials with whom he regularly battles, blaming them for homelessness and the homeless for inconveniencing the wealthy and causing pollution.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/19/19-san-francisco-homeless.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
