Popovich then launched into a tirade about Trump\u2019s presidency without naming the commander-in-chief.\n\nSECOND NBA CARES EVENT CANCELED IN CHINA DURING LAKERS-NETS PRESEASON VISIT: REPORT\n\n\u201c[Silver has] been a heck of a leader in that respect and very courageous. Then you compare it to what we've had to live through the past three years, it's a big difference,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cA big gap there, leadership-wise and courage-wise. It wasn't easy for him to say. He said that in an environment fraught with possible economic peril. But he sided with the principles that we all hold dearly, or most of us did until the last three years. I'm thrilled with what he said. The courage and leadership displayed is off the charts by comparison.\u201d\n\nWhile Silver toed the line between supporting Morey\u2019s free speech and having to navigate through the league\u2019s business dealings in China, Popovich said Silver\u2019s message \u201chelps you understand what direction you need to go in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've all talked about or heard about all the talking heads have and everybody for the last three years, 'What kind of country do you want to be? Who are we? Where do we want to go?' Adam said something that helps you understand what direction you need to go in, rather than the cowardice of not being able to respond to something of the murder of Mr. [Jamal] Khashoggi. There are many, many incidents like that where leadership and courage mean nothing. It's all about personal aggrandizement. I was thrilled.\u201d\n\nNBA'S HONG KONG, CHINA BALANCING ACT INCLUDES SILENCE FROM TYPICALLY OUTSPOKEN BASKETBALL CROWD\n\nSilver released a statement before a news conference. He said the league \u201cwill not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is inevitable that people around the world \u2013 including from America and China \u2013 will have different viewpoints over different issues,\u201d Silver said in the statement. \u201cIt is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences.\u201d\n\nSilver added: \u201cThis is about far more than growing our business...Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA -- and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.\u201d\n\nThe current flap arose after Morey tweeted a picture of a slogan reading \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d But Morey deleted the tweet after significant blowback \u2014 including a tweet from Rockets owner Tillman Fertitta saying Morey \"does NOT speak for\" the team. Morey later backtracked on his advocacy.\n\nADAM SILVER ADDRESSES NBA'S CHINA, HONG KONG CONTROVERSY AND SAYS LEAGUE WON'T REGULATE FREE SPEECH\n\n\u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d\n\nMorey's initial tweet led to several Chinese sportswear brands suspending ties with the Rockets. The Chinese Basketball Association also canceled a preseason event involving the Rockets\u2019 G-League affiliate, according to The Athletic.\n\nChina later canceled two NBA Cares events, putting the preseason game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in jeopardy.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nSilver said later at a press conference the league was \u201capologetic\u201d over the outcome, but was \u201cnot apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of speech,\" though Morey appeared to do that himself in his damage-control tweet. Silver added that he \u201cregrets\u201d how so many Chinese people and NBA fans were upset by Morey's message.", "description": "San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich broke his silence Wednesday amid the NBA\u2019s row with China over a general manager\u2019s tweet supporting the protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
