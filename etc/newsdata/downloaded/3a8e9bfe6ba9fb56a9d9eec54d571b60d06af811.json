One story championed the Confederate flag two weeks after a white supremacist murdered nine black parishioners in a Charleston church in 2015.\n\nThe advertisement, noted first by Daily Beast Editor in Chief Noah Shachtman, triggered a social-media backlash. Seeking to distance itself from Breitbart entirely, the department said the advertisement was \u201ca negative juxtaposition to our core values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe LAPD celebrates diversity and embraces it within our ranks, and within the city we serve,\u201d the department said Saturday. The LAPD also said it has opened an inquiry into how the ad landed on the Breitbart page in the first place.\n\nThe discovery was so bewildering to the department that Chief Michel Moore said on Twitter that the LAPD wondered whether the ad was a \u201cspoof\u201d or an effort to discredit the department by linking it to the far-right operation.\n\nElections chief says a GOP colleague blocked wide release of her foreign activity memo\n\n\u201cNo. LAPD did NOT purchase or otherwise acquire ad space on that website. Senior leadership at ads City Personnel Department also relayed they did not authorize or pay for this ad either,\u201d Moore said on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nIt is unclear how long the ad has appeared on the site and whether there is more than one such ad.\n\nBy Saturday evening, the department discovered the source of the advertisement\u2019s path to Breitbart: The agency purchases advertising through Google, which typically places ads on websites using demographic information rather than deliberately targeting certain publications.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have stopped these Google Ads altogether while we reexamine our ad filters and take all necessary steps to ensure tighter control of ad settings,\u201d the department said.\n\nAd buyers may have been able to avoid the issue by filtering out specific websites beforehand, NBC News noted.\n\nAD\n\nBreitbart did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore said Breitbart is \u201cone of the most pro-police, pro-law-enforcement news organizations in America,\u201d claimed its newsroom is diverse and said the site knows it has \u201cstrong readership among the rank-and-file in the LAPD.\u201d\n\nThe site is known for antagonizing minorities and often defending the Trump administration on familiar themes \u2014 \u201canti-immigration, pro-economic nationalism [and] skepticism of multiculturalism,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s Paul Farhi wrote.\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, Breitbart appears to have sought a more straightforward news approach. But some of its most shocking headlines haunt the publication, such as \u201cThe Smartest People in the World Are All Men,\u201d \u201cBirth Control Makes Women Unattractive and Crazy,\u201d \u201cBill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew\u201d and \u201cData: Young Muslims Are a Ticking Time Bomb in the West.\u201d\n\nAdvertisers have steered clear in recent years, Farhi wrote, and a glut of far-right news websites have further lured readers from Breitbart.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhatever happened to Breitbart?
