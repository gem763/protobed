Namely, what the heck we\u2019re going to be able to play, how much we\u2019ll pay, and when we can get started with the exciting new service \u2014 which beams high-end console and PC games to any Chrome web browser, Chromecast Ultra TV dongle or Pixel 3 smartphone from beefy new Google servers.\n\nThe short version: Google Stadia will launch on November 19th, in 14 different territories including the US, UK and Canada, with at least 31 games from 21 different publishers, for an initial \u201cFounder\u2019s Edition\u201d price of $130 for a hardware starter kit with three months of premium service, and $10 a month afterwards. There\u2019s a separate free tier coming in 2020.\n\nPre-orders for the \u201cFounder\u2019s Edition\u201d are now open, and I\u2019ll explain what it is in a tad, but there\u2019s something important you should know first.\n\nStadia isn\u2019t exactly the \u2018Netflix of games\u2019\n\nWhile you\u2019ve probably heard predictions that Google\u2019s Stadia will be the \u201cNetflix of games,\u201d it turns out the analogy only goes so far. While Google intends to eventually have a back catalog of free games included for your $10 monthly fee, Stadia is not primarily a subscription service. The subscription only includes a single game as of today \u2014 Destiny 2. Primarily, Google tells us you should expect to buy, not rent cloud games for the same retail prices you\u2019d find on other platforms like PlayStation Network, Xbox Live, and Steam.\n\n\u201cWe will sell these games like any other digital storefront,\u201d Google\u2019s director of games Jack Buser tells The Verge.\n\nSo you\u2019re probably wondering: which games and game studios are on board? I won\u2019t leave you in suspense any longer.\n\nStadia confirmed games list (updated October 2019)\n\nBandai Namco - Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2\n\n- Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 Bethesda: Doom Eternal (delayed till March), Doom 2016, Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, Wolfenstein: Youngblood\n\nDoom Eternal (delayed till March), Doom 2016, Rage 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, Wolfenstein: Youngblood Bungie: Destiny 2\n\nDestiny 2 Capcom: TBD\n\nTBD CD Projekt Red: Cyberpunk 2077\n\nCyberpunk 2077 Coatsink: Get Packed (Stadia exclusive)\n\nGet Packed (Stadia exclusive) Codemasters: GRID\n\nGRID Deep Silver: Metro Exodus\n\nMetro Exodus DotEmu: Windjammers 2\n\nWindjammers 2 Drool: Thumper\n\nThumper Electronic Arts: TBD\n\nTBD Giants Software: Farming Simulator 19\n\nFarming Simulator 19 Gwen Frey: Kine\n\nKine Larian Studios: Baldur\u2019s Gate 3\n\nBaldur\u2019s Gate 3 nWay Games: Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid\n\nPower Rangers: Battle for the Grid Robot Entertainment: Orcs Must Die 3!\n\nOrcs Must Die 3!

Still, it already looks like a who\u2019s who of video game publishers are interested in the idea; some enough to bring brand-new games from high-profile franchises like Borderlands, Wolfenstein, Doom, Darksiders and Ghost Recon to Stadia\u2019s catalog.\n\nBuser says that the just-announced Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 will ship simultaneously on Stadia and PC, in fact \u2014 and that those two platforms will be the only ways to play it.\n\nNevertheless, that list of games doesn\u2019t necessarily have a killer app, Google isn\u2019t talking about its own internally developed Stadia-exclusive titles quite yet, and the quality and reliability of Google\u2019s service is (mostly) unproven in the wild.\n\nWhich is probably why Google\u2019s catering to early adopters willing to drop $130+ on a \u201cStadia Founder\u2019s Edition\u201d before it goes any further. For less than the price of a new PS4 or Xbox One, the company\u2019s cobbled together its own console of sorts \u2014 a Chromecast Ultra to plug into your TV and a limited-edition dark blue version of Stadia\u2019s surprisingly cool controller.\n\nSince each of those devices will retail for $70 on their own, you\u2019re arguably getting your money\u2019s worth in gadgets right away, plus the chance to choose a special founder username before anyone else. You\u2019ll also get three months of the Stadia Pro tier of service for you and a friend \u2014 who, like you, will also be able to play on a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3A phone (Google says it hopes to expand to other phones and platforms \u201cover time\u201d) or in the Chrome web browser with the standard HID controller of your choice.\n\nStadia Pro gives you 4K, 60fps streaming with HDR and 5.1 surround sound assuming you\u2019ve got the required 35Mbps of bandwidth, plus access to Stadia\u2019s eventual free catalog, and exclusive discounts on games. The free tier launching in 2020 is limited to 1080p60 with stereo sound, and requires 10Mbps of bandwidth to stream at 720p.\n\nThen there\u2019s Destiny 2. As rumored, Bungie\u2019s Destiny 2 is coming to Stadia, and it\u2019s the streaming service\u2019s flagship title in many ways. It\u2019s the only game guaranteed to let you pick up where you left off on Xbox or PC thanks to new cross-save functionality \u2014 Stadia project manager Andrey Doronichev says \u201cwe\u2019re still working with PlayStation to figure out the transition\u201d \u2014 and the only one that\u2019s confirmed to include DLC, with the Stadia version bundling every single add-on including the brand-new Shadowkeep expansion.\n\nMaybe as importantly, Destiny 2 is the only game that comes free with the Stadia Founder\u2019s Edition and the only game Google\u2019s confirmed you won\u2019t need to buy separately. Though like any other free-with-Stadia Pro title, it\u2019s only available so long as you keep paying that $10 monthly.\n\nGoogle Stadia launch regions and pricing Territory Founder's Edition Stadia Pro (monthly) Stadia Controller Territory Founder's Edition Stadia Pro (monthly) Stadia Controller US $129.00 $9.99 $69.00 Canada $169.00 $11.99 $89.00 UK \u00a3119.00 \u00a38.99 \u00a359.00 Ireland \u20ac119.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 France \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Germany \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Italy \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Spain \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Netherlands \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Belgium \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Finland \u20ac129.00 \u20ac9.99 \u20ac69.00 Denmark DKK999 DKK69 DKK549 Sweden SEK1,399 SEK99 SEK749 Norway NOK1,299 NOK99 NOK699\n\nNote: Google says Stadia won\u2019t be available in Hawaii or Guam at launch.\n\nOf course, you don\u2019t need to drop the initial $130 or $10 a month on Stadia if you\u2019re willing to wait until 2020, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to buy into Google-branded hardware at all if you\u2019re willing to wait. It's coming to more Android phones, and when I ask if we can expect the service to eventually hit Apple TVs, Rokus, maybe even iOS devices, Doronichev says the goal is to go as broad as possible: \u201cWe want to be everywhere.\u201d He says there\u2019s no particular spec another Android phone would need to support Stadia, merely certification to ensure it\u2019s a good experience. (You won't need to re-pair the Stadia controller over and over to each supported device, by the way - it's a Wi-Fi device that communicates directly with Stadia's servers so you can swap platforms easily.)\n\nWould you pay $130 to play Destiny 2?\n\nNote that \u201ceverywhere\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily include playing games on the go over a cellular connection quite yet though, merely Wi-Fi and wired Ethernet to start. \u201cYou should not expect your existing cellular connection to work,\u201d says Doronichev, adding that the company\u2019s bullish on 5G\u2019s potential to change that.\n\nAnd Google says not all of Stadia\u2019s lofty vision from its March announcement at GDC \u2014 see our video below \u2014 will necessarily make it by launch. While that nifty feature that lets you click through a YouTube video ad for a game and instantly start playing should be available, and Ghost Recon will offer split-screen multiplayer with friends, it\u2019s not clear that YouTubers will be able to simultaneously play and livestream a game to YouTube quite yet, nor invite their fans to join in (perhaps for good reason, considering YouTube\u2019s challenges right now).\n\nOver time, Buser says we should not only see additional exclusive games on Stadia, but also cross-platform games doing things on Stadia \u201cthat would be impossible to do on a console or PC.\u201d Instead of dividing up virtual worlds into tiny \"shards\" where only 100 or 150 players can occupy the same space at a time because of the limitations of individual servers, he says Google\u2019s internal network can support living, breathing virtual worlds filled with thousands of simultaneous players.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the economics support throwing additional cloud compute power at a game, though, if people are paying the same $60 to buy a game that they do today. Since Stadia\u2019s servers are powerful enough to actually let you play games, they likely cost more to maintain than the ones digital distribution platforms like Steam, Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo use to let you merely download files over the internet. (Buser wouldn\u2019t say.)\n\nBut Google may feel a need to aggressively compete to be a leader in cloud gaming, since the competition looks like it may be fierce. Microsoft said it will \u201cgo big\u201d at E3 with its own xCloud service as well as a new Xbox console, and Sony said that it will take its own PlayStation Now service \u201cto the next level later this year.\u201d There\u2019s evidence that Amazon may have its own cloud gaming service, and we exclusively revealed in January that Verizon was testing one too.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Stadia is any good yet. We hope to find out soon. But either way, it seems like the cloud gaming wars are nearly here.\n\nUpdate, October 15th: Added Stadia\u2019s official November 19th release date and updated the list of confirmed games.", "description": "Today, Google has revealed the key details that were conspicuously missing from its March announcement of the new Stadia game streaming service \u2014 namely, what the heck we\u2019re going to be able to play, how much we\u2019ll pay, and when we can actually get started with that service, which beams high-end console and PC games to any Chrome web browser, Chromecast Ultra TV dongle or Pixel 3 smartphone from beefy Google servers.
