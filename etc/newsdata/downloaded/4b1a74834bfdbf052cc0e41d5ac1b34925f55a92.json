Until this year, none of them had, since 2011, experienced the purgatory of being in the House minority. In the 2018 \u201cTexodus,\u201d five Texas Republican representatives retired (a sixth resigned) and two were defeated. Of the 241 Republicans in the House when President Trump was inaugurated, almost 40 percent are gone or going. See a trend?\n\nHurd, who is not forswearing public life, insists, \u201cI\u2019m just getting started.\u201d Might he come back to electoral politics? \u201cFor sure.\u201d His \u201cpassion\u201d is \u201cthe nexus between technology and national security.\u201d He is, however, saying goodbye to the rigors of the \u201cDC to DQ\u201d tours that have regularly taken him to the far reaches of his district. For you effete coastal residents who are unfamiliar with the delights of flyover country, \u201cDQ\u201d means Dairy Queen. Hurd meets gatherings of constituents at DQs because \u201cevery town has one, and everyone knows where they are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHurd, an articulate, assertive 6-foot-4 former CIA operative and the only African American Republican in the House, thinks voting trends \u201care moving so fast\u201d that 2020 \u201chas nothing to do with 2016.\u201d Just as \u201cU.S. economic and military dominance are no longer guaranteed,\u201d neither is Republican dominance in Texas, a state that is hardly immune to national trends.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNationally, Republicans are decreasingly strong where two generations ago they were especially robust \u2014 in suburbs. Texas ranks high among the states in terms of the percentage of the population that is suburban. And statewide, whites are a minority.\n\nIn 2008, with the Great Recession underway, John McCain carried Texas by 12 points. In 2012, Mitt Romney carried it by 16. In 2016, Trump (whom Hurd did not endorse) won by nine points. In Texas\u2019s most important 2018 contest for a federal office, incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz won by just three. See a trend?\n\nIf the Democratic Party can collect Texas\u2019s electoral votes \u2014 38 today, perhaps 41 after the 2020 Census \u2014 as well as California\u2019s 55, it will reap 35.5 percent of a winning 270 from just two states. Then the GOP will have almost no plausible path to 270, and Democrats who are currently hot to abolish the electoral college will suddenly say: Oh, never mind.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd Hurd will repeat what he says today: Texas is \u201calready purple.\u201d Republicans \u201chave to get out of our own way\u201d because \u201cif the Republican Party in Texas does not start looking like Texas, there will not be a Republican Party in Texas.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "To win in Texas, the GOP has to start looking like Texas.", "authors": ["George F.
