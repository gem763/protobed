Australia\u2019s third largest island, Kangaroo Island is governed by wildlife. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s home to more kangaroos (60,000) than full-time residents (fewer than 5,000). What is surprising, however, is how much it has to offer travelers. For a place not that far off the beaten path, it\u2019s relatively undiscovered.\n\nAbout 10,000 years ago Kangaroo Island broke free from the continent. Today, it\u2019s an easy ferry ride from Cape Jervis in South Australia. There are multiple ferries a day, and the scenic crossing only takes 45 minutes. By air, Kangaroo Island is a 35-minute Qantas flight from Adelaide.\n\nKangaroo Island, Australia, is home to more kangaroos (60,000) than full-time residents (fewer than 5,000).

Explore much of the 1,700-square-mile island \u2013 smaller than Delaware \u2013 and its 300 miles of coastline at your leisure. Just remember any animals you encounter have the right of way.\n\nSteve Irwin's family: See wildlife responsibly on these trips\n\nKangaroo Island is home to everything from a smaller, darker kangaroo species that evolved to survive \u201cisland life\u201d to fairy penguins (the world\u2019s smallest penguins) and prehistoric echidnas (the only other egg-laying mammal besides the platypus). Like the Galapagos, it\u2019s also famous among wildlife biologists for its seals and sea lions. A self-guided tour at Seal Bay is one of the best ways to observe the Australian sea lion up close. More than 800 comprise the island\u2019s largest colony.\n\nSeal Bay Conservation Park on Kangaroo Island, Australia (Photo: South Australia Tourism Commission)\n\nWhile most of Kangaroo Islands wildlife is endemic \u2013 including a tiny insect-eating marsupial unique to the island \u2013 there are still invasive species. The most notable, and newsworthy might be the koala. In 1920, 18 koalas were introduced to the island in an effort to boost Australia\u2019s koala population. Today, there are more than 25,000 living on Kangaroo Island. Recently, they made headlines when a video of two koalas fighting and \u201cyelling\u201d at each other went viral.\n\nSure, you can\u2019t encounter Darwin\u2019s famous finches here. But you can get your photo taken with a koala, (something Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan did on their 2018 royal visit Down Under). You can also cradle a wombat in your arms, play with dingoes or even bottle-feed an orphan joey. It\u2019s all possible at Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, where you can find more than 150 native Australian species.\n\nBesides the wildlife park, there are other attractions where unforgettable memories can be made. For starters, Kangaroo Island goes out of its way to cater to adrenaline seekers. Exploring the island\u2019s bush by quad won\u2019t disturb the peace, in fact, it\u2019s welcome. You can also leave a trail of fat bike tracks, play paintball (with biodegradable paint balls) and even sand board or race toboggans in the island\u2019s natural dune park known as the \u201cLittle Sahara.\u201d\n\nWater-based offerings are just as thrilling. There\u2019s surfing at Vivonne Bay, and several outfitters offer swimming with wild dolphins and sea lions. It\u2019s not unheard of to reel in a whisker shark on a chartered deep-sea fishing excursion. But perhaps the most unique encounters to be had are underwater \u2013 snorkeling and diving where scientists recently discovered fossils of a frightening new sea creature. They deemed it the Redlichia rex, which loosely translates into T-Rex of the sea.\n\nSo how long does it take to truly get a taste of Kangaroo Island?\n\nFor most travelers, a few days is enough. But for a serious foodie, it could take weeks. There aren\u2019t hundreds of restaurants to choose from, but this is an island where farm- and sea-to-table is the norm, not a marketing ploy. The first Sunday of the month is sacred. It\u2019s when purveyors gather at the Kangaroo Island Farmers Market in Penneshaw to sell and trade their organic honey, herb-infused olive oil, free-range eggs, seasonal produce and local wine.\n\nKangaroo Island is a burgeoning wine destination with several family-owned vineyards, including The Islander Estate Vineyards, started in 2000 by a winemaker from Bordeaux, France. But grape growers aren\u2019t the only agricultural entrepreneurs recognizing the island\u2019s potential in producing libations worthy of export. There\u2019s Kangaroo Island Spirits \u2013 South Australia\u2019s first boutique distillery \u2013 and Kangaroo Island Brewery, where craft beers are poured, locals sing along to live music and the rotating blackboard menu depends on the chef of the day.\n\nKangaroo Island Spirits is South Australia\u2019s first boutique distillery.

June through August are the wetter and mild winter months when the average low is 41. Of course, accommodation prices are lower during these months than the peak summer months when Australians go on holiday.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no public transportation on the island, there\u2019s no shortage of accommodations. Instead of high-rise hotels or hundreds of apartments on Airbnb, expect charming bed and breakfasts, private villas, all-inclusive luxury properties and even lighthouse keepers\u2019 cottages to rent. Most rooms are found around the island\u2019s largest town, Kingscote.\n\nOf course, there are also plenty of places to camp too. The only danger of sleeping under the stars on Kangaroo Island is waking up to its diverse wildlife. Should that happen, just channel your inner Darwin.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/07/kangaroo-island-australia-wildlife-haven-rivaling-galapagos-islands/3856711002/", "description": "Kangaroo Island, Australia, is home to more kangaroos (60,000) than full-time residents (fewer than 5,000).", "authors": ["Katie Jackson", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
