At 1.96 lbs (890 grams) and 0.39 inches (9.95mm), it beats out Apple\u2019s recently departed 12-inch MacBook for portability. It\u2019s even a full third of a pound lighter than an iPad Pro with Apple\u2019s Smart Keyboard attached.\n\nThe Swift 7 also one-ups the MacBook with a 14-inch touchscreen display. This isn\u2019t a tiny laptop for occasional use \u2014 it\u2019s designed to be a primary computer for someone looking for the ultimate thin-and-light laptop.\n\nOn paper, the Swift 7 has everything else that would make it the ultimate thin-and-light: a dual-core Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of NVMe storage, and two USB Type-C Thunderbolt 3 ports. In the box, Acer includes a thin pouch and a dongle that adds a USB-A port and HDMI. Despite its diminutive size, the Swift 7 is a lot of computer for its $1,699.99 price tag.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t take long living with the Swift 7 to learn it makes some significant compromises to enable its form factor.\n\nOur review of Acer Swift 7 Verge Score 5 out of 10 Good Stuff Incredibly thin and light\n\nLarge display for its size\n\nFanless design keeps things quiet Bad Stuff Awkward keyboard layout\n\nPoor palm rejection on the trackpad\n\nThin, wimpy speakers\n\nDoesn\u2019t like to charge with standard USB-C adapters\n\nWebcam is virtually useless\n\nDisplay has a slow touch response\n\nDoesn\u2019t take much to overwhelm the processor Buy for $1,449.00 from Microsoft Buy for $1,938.99 from Newegg\n\nThe Swift 7 is available in two colors, white or black, and I strongly prefer the white model. Unlike the black version, the white model doesn\u2019t show any fingerprints or smudges and looks much cleaner as a result.\n\nAs you might expect from the specs I mentioned above, the Swift 7 is incredibly light to carry and very easy to transport from one place to another \u2014 so much so that I often didn\u2019t even realize it was in my bag. But it also lacks the solid feel of other laptops, with more flex and flimsiness in its chassis than you\u2019d expect or want from a laptop that costs this much. Acer insists that the magnesium-lithium and magnesium-aluminum alloys used in its construction \u201care lighter and stronger than aluminum alone at the same thickness,\u201d but the experience of using the laptop doesn\u2019t inspire much confidence that it can take a beating.\n\nThat feeling was amplified by my initial review device: the first Swift 7 I had in for review developed a screen flicker out of the blue, despite never having been dropped or mishandled. The replacement unit Acer sent me did not exhibit the same problem after a few weeks of use, but I\u2019m still a little wary of carelessly tossing this laptop into my bag.\n\nAside from the issue I had with the first model, the Swift 7\u2019s screen is impressive. It\u2019s a large, 14-inch panel with the tiniest of bezels above and on the sides. It has 1080p resolution, which is plenty sharp at this size, and is rich and vibrant with good viewing angles.\n\nThe display is a touchscreen, but oddly, the panel is not very responsive. I frequently have to tap the screen twice for it to register my touches, especially if I\u2019m not actively using the touchscreen to navigate. It\u2019s almost like the touch controller goes to sleep and needs to be awakened before it will start responding.\n\nThe pop-up webcam is equally useless as it is clever\n\nAround the screen is where you\u2019ll find another feature that was compromised to make the Swift 7 as small as possible: there\u2019s no webcam. Instead, Acer has hidden the camera in a pop-out module on the left side of the keyboard deck, combining the approaches of Dell\u2019s older XPS 13 laptops and Huawei\u2019s MateBook X Pro. The camera, unsurprisingly, provides a terrible experience, capturing either my fingers typing on the keyboard or the middle of my chest when on a call. It\u2019s essentially useless for any practical purposes.\n\nSince the camera can\u2019t be used for facial login, Acer has built a fingerprint scanner into the power button, located just to the left of the keyboard. This worked fine in my tests, until a rogue Windows Update caused the computer to \u201cforget\u201d the fingerprint scanner existed at all. Rolling back the update and reinstalling it fixed the problem, but troubleshooting it did waste half a day.\n\nThe Swift 7\u2019s keyboard is another example of compromise. In an effort to cram as many keys into the layout as possible, Acer made some unorthodox key placement decisions that I was unable to get accustomed to, even with weeks of use. The caps lock key is half size, the arrow keys are surrounded by home and end keys, and worst of all, the delete key is found right next to the backspace key, with no space between them. Needless to say, I constantly hit the delete key when I intended to hit backspace, and would land on the home and end keys instead of the arrow keys when I wanted to scroll or move the cursor around.\n\nAside from the layout issues, typing on the keyboard is fine, but it\u2019s not the best I\u2019ve ever used. The Swift 7\u2019s keys have very little travel, as you\u2019d expect, and they feel a bit mushy, but they are backlit and have adequate spacing between them.\n\nI could never get used to the Swift 7\u2019s keyboard layout\n\nSimilarly, although the trackpad is weirdly wide, it tracks nicely and feels smooth under my fingers. But it has poor palm rejection, which, combined with its unusually wide shape, means the cursor jumps around a lot when I\u2019m typing.\n\nInside, the Swift 7 is using a fanless 8th Gen Core i7 processor paired with 16GB of RAM. As we\u2019ve seen in laptops with similar Y-Series chips, it\u2019s not hard to find the limits of this processor, even with everyday productivity tasks like web browsing, email, Slack, and using Office. If you\u2019re not a heavy multitasker, the processor is probably fine, but if you bounce between different tasks frequently, it won\u2019t be hard to make the Swift 7 sweat.\n\nThe fanless design means the computer stays quiet, but it also means the deck gets rather warm, especially on the right side when the laptop is charging. (The charging ports are on the right side of the computer.) It\u2019s not enough to burn my fingers or stop me from using it, but it\u2019s definitely less comfortable to use than a more actively cooled computer.\n\nUnderneath the laptop are two small speakers, which sound about as good as you might expect them to. They are thin and squawky, and don\u2019t provide much volume, not to mention any bass. You\u2019ll definitely want to use a set of headphones more often than not.\n\nFinally, the Swift 7 has merely average battery life, hitting just under six hours between charges in my real-world usage tests. I don\u2019t typically expect much more from a laptop this thin, but it does mean that you can\u2019t really rely on it to last a whole day of work, and you might have issues using it for a full cross-country flight. Exacerbating the matter is the pickiness of the USB-C ports: the Swift 7 did not like powering up with any other charger than the one it came with. Even if I used a USB-C cable and charger that were rated for well above the 45W of the stock charger, the Swift 7 would refuse to accept a charge. That means that even though the Swift 7 is extremely light, you\u2019ll also be carrying its power brick around with you everywhere since it won\u2019t reliably charge off of a USB-C battery or other adapter.\n\nThe goal of the Swift 7 is noble: make a standard clamshell laptop as thin and light as possible in order to make it as portable as it can be. As a regular commuter, it\u2019s something I\u2019d typically appreciate \u2014 anything that makes my backpack or shoulder bag lighter makes me happier. But the number of compromises the Swift 7 has to make to hit its level of thinness and lightness are just too much for me. I\u2019d rather put up with an extra half pound of weight and quarter inch of thickness for a better keyboard, better performance, more reliable build quality, and a usable webcam.", "description": "Acer\u2019s Swift 7 is one of the thinnest and lightest full-size laptops you can buy.
