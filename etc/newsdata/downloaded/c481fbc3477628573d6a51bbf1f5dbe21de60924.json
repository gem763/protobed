House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy responded: \u201cFacts be damned. Democrats are insisting this is their moment to impeach President Trump. Speaker Pelosi\u2019s decree changes nothing.\u201d\n\nAnd, thus, without even intending it, Mr. McCarthy just stumbled into what will be the campaign slogan for the Democratic Party from now until November 2020.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter which candidate prevails in this clown-show of a primary our country is presently forced to endure. The campaign tagline for the eventual nominee, whether it is Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris, will be, \u201cThe facts be damned. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nConsider the following.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s former chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti, is caught admitting the real motivation behind the Green New Deal has little to do with climate change but is instead a bold-faced move to seize control of the world\u2019s economy. \u201cThe interesting thing about the Green New Deal,\u201d said Mr. Chakrabarti, \u201cis it wasn\u2019t originally a climate thing at all. Do you guys think of it as a climate thing?\u201d Because we really think of it as a how-do-you-change-the-entire-economy thing.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are destroying the Earth. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nBlack and Hispanic unemployment reach record lows as the U.S. Labor Department reports the smallest gap between minority and white unemployment ever recorded in the nation\u2019s history.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are racists. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nRasmussen tells us that voters continue to say President Trump has been better for young blacks than President Barack Obama. Thirty-three percent of likely voters report that life for young African-Americans has gotten better since Mr. Trump\u2019s election, compared to just 13 percent who said the same at the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are hurting blacks. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nSocialism continues to fail in every country it has ever been tried. Venezuela. Cuba. China. North Korea. Soviet Russia. Economies are destroyed. Freedom is stolen. Human dignity is lost.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Socialism is good. Capitalism is evil. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nWomen lose their sports, lose their scholarships and lose the right to even have their own restrooms because of the misogynistic delusions of the rainbow cabal and LGBTQ fascism.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans oppress women. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood leaders are caught bragging about selling human lungs, legs, hearts and heads. Life is sacrificed for Lamborghinis.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans don\u2019t care about children. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nYoung boys and girls are trafficked and sold for sex by the tens of thousands through porous and unsecured borders.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are inhumane. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nPublic schools care more about teaching young boys how to use a condom than how to develop character. Chivalry is mocked. Masculinity is toxic. Victimization trumps virtue. Government-defined consent supplants God\u2019s Ten Commandments.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are anti-education. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nSTDs are pandemic. Twenty-five percent of millennial-aged women are now infected with a sexually transmitted disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that male-on-male sexual activity results in an overwhelmingly disproportionate number of deaths from AIDs.\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned. Republicans are prudes. Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nThe list goes on and on. Rep. Ilhan Omar proves she\u2019s an anti-Semite. Mrs. Harris mocks due process. Mrs. Pelosi disparages religious freedom. Pete Buttigieg creates his own religion. Beto O\u2019Rourke says, \u201cHell yes,\u201d he\u2019ll ignore the U.S. Constitution. Sen. Bernie Sanders promises confiscatory taxes. Ms. Warren is the \u201cchief\u2019 of cultural appropriation.\u201d And Mr. Biden boasts of choosing \u201ctruth over facts.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic response? \u201cThe facts be damned.\u201d Impeach Trump!\u201d\n\nIn his book, \u201cTruth Decay,\u201d Douglas Groothuis writes, \u201cIf the idea of objective truth falls into disrepute [i.e. if \u2018the facts be damned\u2019], politics devolves into nothing but image manipulation and power-mongering.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to argue, \u201cIntellect loses its virtue when it ceases to seek truth and turns to the pursuit of political ends. Social consensus and the duties of shared citizenship become irrelevant and impossible as various subsets of the population \u2014 differentiated by race, ethnicity and sexual orientation \u2014 grasp for power \u2026\n\n\u201c[When] law is not grounded in a moral order that transcends [power] it becomes malleable and ultimately arbitrary \u2026 When reasonable debate serves no purpose in achieving knowledge of the truth, all that remains are the machinations of power \u2026 Citizens become tribes of people with little sense of the public good. The maxim of \u2018speaking truth to power\u2019 is transformed into \u2018mobilizing our power to overcome [yours].\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPower mongering.\u201d\n\n\u201cMachinations of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur power over yours.\u201d\n\nRemember these warnings the next time you hear someone shout from the stump, \u201cthe facts be damned.\u201d Then go vote for their opponent.\n\n\u2022 Everett Piper, former president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, is a columnist for The Washington Times and author of \u201cNot A Day Care: The Devastating Consequences of Abandoning Truth\u201d (Regnery 2017).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
