For local teen band The Emergence, creating an award-winning song from scratch was the biggest hurdle they faced as songwriters.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the six-member band won the award for Best Original Lyrics at the ninth annual Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Youth Band Sound Competition, organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG). They also came second in the Hong Kong Regional section, and took third place in the Asia-Pacific category.\n\nReflecting on the process of constructing a song, James Wu Chun-hin, the band\u2019s 16-year-old drummer, told Young Post that he found producing an original piece emotionally challenging.\n\nHK youth rock band Popcorn Virus on how music gives them direction in life, and spreading positivity\n\n\u201cYou must learn to be self-reflective and critical before taking the first step, to establish the right course for the song,\u201d he tells Young Post when we meet the band.\n\nThe idea for the song\u2019s music came about when James, who studies at International Christian Quality Music Secondary School with four of his five bandmates (the sixth member goes to St Francis Xavier College), played a series of random notes on his piano.\n\nHe then sent a recording of this tune to the band\u2019s guitarist, 15-year-old Kudos Lam.\n\nThe Emergence wins Best Original Lyrics at the Hong Kong Asia-Pacific Youth Band Sound Competition.

Just like that, the duo began adding new ideas to each other\u2019s suggestions. After two months of work and lots of editing, the song gradually came to life.\n\nAlthough it took a lot of time and brain power, both boys agree that they inspired each other to achieve more than they could have on their own.\n\n\u201cIf you want your song to capture people\u2019s hearts, it\u2019s completely dependent on how much time, emotion and effort you put into making it better. It\u2019s an ongoing process,\u201d says Kudos.\n\nA group of teen Hong Kong dancers wants the city to embrace hip hop culture\n\nTheir Cantonese pop song, Voyage, is an expression of the songwriters\u2019 approach to life. Kudos explains that in life\u2019s journey, it\u2019s important to look forward, move on and not be brought down by problems.\n\n\u201cPeople may say that we\u2019re too young to know or even write about life, as we haven\u2019t gone through much of it. But there are different kinds of lyrics; some come from personal experience, some may not. This song, particularly, is a letter to our future selves,\u201d says James.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to encourage our future selves, because our lives won\u2019t be a smooth ride, but the voyage goes on.\u201d\n\nWhen their bandmates listened to the duo\u2019s song, they were amazed by their friends\u2019 talent. Classmate and keyboard player Angus Lee Kai-yin, 16, was surprised that James and Kudos could create a song that speaks to so many people.\n\n\u201cMy favourite line in the song is: \u2018The journey continues, my heart is determined and my willpower is strong\u2019,\u201d says 15-year-old vocalist Jason Cheng Yan-kiu.\n\nFormed in December 2017, the band started by busking around the city.\n\nFrom watching Pitch Perfect to living out their Pentatonix dreams: local a capella groups tell us why their friendship matters\n\nRealising that they had good chemistry, the boys decided to form The Emergence. However, it wasn\u2019t until the HKFYG competition that they really became committed to one another. Initially, academic pressure and busy schedules meant that not all band members could attend every rehearsal, says Kudos.\n\nBut the competition has changed that. Not only have they realised the importance of music in their lives, they want to achieve something as a team.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re in a band, we\u2019re all more or less arranging or rearranging a song as we play it because we might all be feeling differently, or interpreting that song differently \u2013 and if we project these feelings when we play, we\u2019re all contributing to the arrangement of the song,\u201d says James. \u201cIn the end, the most important thing about music is to have fun with it.\u201d", "description": "After their win at the Asia-Pacific Youth Band Sound Competition, the group speaks about the importance of music and the thrill of achieving something as a team.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/407c11e8-f4b9-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6imagehires185411.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
