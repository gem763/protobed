This was followed by Manchester on 50%.\n\nOverall, 26 local authorities had more than a third of beds in sub-standard settings.\n\nBy comparison, Southampton, Windsor and Maidenhead, Peterborough and Kingston, in London, all had less than 5% of beds in homes judged not good enough.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the situation was \"unacceptable\" and left some people with \"no choice\" but to accept sub-standard care homes because good homes would be over-subscribed.\n\n\"The sad truth is that following years of underfunding and neglect, the social care system has now more or less completely broken down in some parts of the country,\" she said.\n\nThe IPPR agreed it was a sign of a failing market.\n\nThe think tank said costs had been cut in the care sector, and urged the government to take action by investing and reforming social care.\n\nIt wants to see tax rises to provide free personal care for all and to help expand the number of beds by up to 75,000, arguing the state could be more involved in running services.\n\nCare companies have complained over recent years they have been squeezed by the low fees paid by councils, which fund most care home places.\n\nThe system is means-tested for over-65s, which means there are large numbers of self-funders.\n\nThe government said its plans to reform the system would be published in \"due course\" and pointed out it had announced an extra \u00a31.5bn for the sector for 2020-21 in the recent spending round.\n\n\"We expect everyone to be able to access high quality, safe and compassionate care,\" a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman added.", "description": "An analysis maps the areas with the highest concentrations of sub-standard care home places.", "authors": ["Nick Triggle", "Health Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1825D/production/_105790989_gettyimages-868900594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
