I don\u2019t go and look at them every day, but it\u2019s nice to know they\u2019re there.\u2019\n\nAs Princess Diana\u2019s favourite dressmaker, Catherine Walker created many of her most splendid gowns, transforming her from shy Sloane to a royal power player.\n\nThe Princess was even buried in a black Catherine Walker evening dress that she had bought just a few weeks before her death.\n\nNow Cyrus is weaving his magic around the Duchess of Cambridge, after the 37-year-old chose a bright green Catherine Walker tunic for the second day of her royal tour of Pakistan this week.\n\nPrincess Diana with Catherine Walker and her team of dressmakers in Kensington Palace\n\nThe Duchess also dazzled in a pale blue shalwar kameez, another one of Cyrus\u2019s creations, inspiring comparisons with Princess Diana\u2019s wardrobe during her visit to the country in 1997. Thanks to the \u2018Kate effect\u2019, Said says he\u2019s \u2018never been busier\u2019 and believes his clothes give women confidence.\n\nCyrus is the model of discretion when it comes to his clients . . . but he did let me in on one secret.\n\n\u2018When you do bespoke, you realise that everybody is lopsided, there is no such thing as a perfectly symmetrical person. You\u2019ve only got to be right-handed to have a completely different shoulder on one side to the other, which you learn when you start measuring people.\u2019\n\nPerhaps the picture-perfect Duchess has her flaws?\n\nDoes BBC TV boss Charlotte Moore require a stiffener before locking horns with Corporation bosses?

Davies, who depicted the late Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe in the TV series starring Hugh Grant, has set his sights on another disgraced politician.\n\n\u2018Keith Vaz was pretending to be a washing machine salesman and bringing rent boys to his hotel room.

That needs a bit more thought.\u2019\n\nCorbyn's book at bedtime's so achingly woke\n\nSparring with Boris Johnson hasn\u2019t stopped Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn from finding the time to relax at home.\n\n\u2018I unwind by reading. I\u2019m reading a very good book at the moment about a Hindu lesbian,\u2019 he tells me at the PinkNews Awards at Church House, Westminster, of The Normal State Of Mind by Susmita Bhattacharya.\n\n\u2018She escapes from Calcutta to Mumbai because her family discovered she was having an affair with a wealthy woman, whose husband also found out and so put a stop to all of it.\u2019 Makes a change from Boris\u2019s literary hero, the macho Flashman.\n\nCorbyn adds he bought the novel locally. \u2018I bought it in New Beacon Books, an Afro-Caribbean bookshop I like very much in Finsbury Park.\u2019\n\nNo trousers required for heiress Tamara...\n\nTamara Ecclestone attending Apothem x Harvey Nichols launch party on October 16, 2019\n\nSTONE THE CROWS! Socialite Tamara Ecclestone (above) was promoting cannabis oil at Harvey Nichols. It\u2019s not quite what you think as her husband Jay Rutland is an investor in lifestyle brand Apothem, which sells the legal CBD oil as a therapeutic treatment. \u2018I feel very secure and very confident, and that\u2019s a very empowering feeling to have.

However, since starring as the main character in new action film Black And Blue, she\u2019s had a change of heart.\n\n\u2018I thought I\u2019d never play a lead, but then I absolutely loved it.
