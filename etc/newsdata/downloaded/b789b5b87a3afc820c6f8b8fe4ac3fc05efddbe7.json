If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nChromebooks stand as an affordable option for college students, costing anywhere from $200 to $600 (with the exception of the Google Pixelbook), but are they worth the money? If you spend most of your time browsing the web, scrolling through Facebook and the like, then yes. These cheap machines like these are ideal for light usage, which is why they've made such a dent in the education market. They're also at lower risk for security issues because they exclusively run web-based applications.\n\nIf you just want to know which one's the best, it's the Google Pixelbook (available at Amazon for $1,349.99). It boasts nine hours of battery life, a lightweight form factor, a sophisticated design, and speedy performance\u2014basically, it checks all the right boxes. However, we went hands-on with a slew of Chromebooks: from traditional 'books to versatile 2-in-1's, we checked performance, build quality, and everything else. Everything on this list has something for those looking to buy a chromebook.\n\n1. Best Overall: Google Pixelbook (2017, Intel Core i7)\n\nGoogle Pixelbook (2017, Intel Core i7) (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you've got a taste for the future, the Google Pixelbook is about as futuristic as Chromebooks get. With its top-notch hardware, versatile 2-in-1 design, touchscreen support, backlit keyboard, and long battery life, this high-end Chromebook has a lot to offer.\n\nThe keyboard is an absolute dream to type on, too. The keys are well-spaced and typing is clicky and pleasant. But while we love the full Android support and glass touchpad, there were still a couple of nitpicks we had to grapple with.\n\nThe pen is sold separately, which stinks because that's another cost. It's also very expensive for a Chromebook. The entry-level model alone will cost you less than a grand, which is almost double the price of the Asus Chromebook Flip. Drawbacks aside, if you've got the funds, this is the best Chromebook we've ever tested.\n\nGet the Google Pixelbook (2017, Intel Core i7) from Amazon for $1,349.99\n\n2. Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 81JX0001UX\n\nLenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 81JX0001UX (Photo: Lenovo)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for speedy performance, look no further than the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook. Even with 22 tabs open in Google Chrome (I\u2019m an agent of chaos), I experienced zero lag. It\u2019s a good machine for multitasking or watching live Twitch streams. The 4K display is fantastic, too. When I watched the trailer for Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, the orange sand dunes of Jakku really popped off of the screen.\n\nUnfortunately, when we ran our primary battery test, which cycles through popular websites on a continuous loop (the idea is to simulate everyday use), the Yoga died in about six hours. That\u2019s a little less than your average workday. Though it\u2019s not the worst result we\u2019ve ever seen, it\u2019s unimpressive for a Chromebook. The mediocre battery life may have something to do with the Yoga\u2019s 4K display, as I imagine it\u2019s a huge power-suck.\n\nGet the Lenovo Yoga Chromebook C630 81JX0001UX from Amazon for $1,034.97\n\n3. Asus Chromebook Flip C434TA-DSM4T\n\nAsus Chromebook Flip C434TA-DSM4T (Photo: ASUS)\n\nIf you\u2019re a young professional, you should definitely check out the latest version of the Asus Chromebook Flip. Its performance is good enough for everyday tasks like surfing the web and checking email, and its bezels are practically nonexistent (this means you\u2019re getting a ton of screen). But what I like best is the sophisticated design. With its aluminum finish and chrome trim, the C434T looks and feels like a premium product (minus the premium price tag). It\u2019s one of the most elegant-looking Chromebooks we\u2019ve seen in a while.\n\nThe only thing that tripped me up was the trackpad. It\u2019s not as responsive as a MacBook touchpad, and it took me some time to adjust to it. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a deal-breaker, per se, it\u2019s just something to be aware of.\n\nGet the Asus Chromebook Flip C434TA-DSM4T from Amazon for $539.99\n\n4. Acer Chromebook Spin 13 CP713-1WN-53NF\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 13 CP713-1WN-53NF (Photo: Acer)\n\nThe Chromebook Spin 13 is a great option for the college student, as it\u2019s budget-friendly and has a wide selection of ports (which eliminates the need for an adapter). We also like that the stylus is included and that you can store it inside a little compartment in the laptop\u2019s shell. What surprised us most about this laptop was its tall display, as I expected it to be awkward to handle. Fortunately, the hinges are tight and strong so the screen didn\u2019t wobble at all.\n\nThough we adore this laptop, there are some trade-offs. When we put the Spin through our battery test, which cycles through websites like Twitch and Amazon, it died in about five hours. Additionally, the laptop itself feels pretty bulky. Weighing a little over three pounds. That said, it\u2019s definitely durable. There\u2019s hardly any flex to the display and the keyboard didn\u2019t creak when I pushed down on it with both hands.\n\nGet the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 CP713-1WN-53NF from Amazon for $724.90\n\n5. Google Pixel Slate (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB)\n\nGoogle Pixel Slate (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB) (Photo: Google)\n\nIf you\u2019re always-on-the-go, the Pixel Slate is a good option. Weighing a little over a pound, the Slate is super lightweight. Its gorgeous display is great for Netflix binges, while its powerful internals makes it easy to work on multiple projects at once. You can also use it as a tablet or prop it up like an easel with the Pixelbook Keyboard.\n\nThe only downside is its high price tag. Its least expensive configuration cost about a grand, so it might not be a good fit for someone on a tight budget. In addition to its costly starting price, you have to pay extra for the Pixelbook Keyboard and Pixelbook Pen, as they\u2019re considered standalone accessories.\n\nGet the Google Pixel Slate (Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB) from Amazon for $849\n\n6. HP Chromebook X2 12-F014DX\n\nHP Chromebook X3 12-F014DX (Photo: HP)\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a Chromebook that also happens to be a tablet, the HP Chromebook x2 is a great choice. Between the long battery life, convertible design, and vibrant display, there\u2019s a lot we love. My only complaint is that it\u2019s a little heavy/bulky for a convertible and it\u2019s not the fastest Chromebook we\u2019ve ever tested. That said, if you\u2019re only checking e-mail or watching streaming services, performance shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue.\n\nWe really like that the keyboard and stylus are included. This is a nice perk because they tend to cost a pretty penny as standalone accessories. It\u2019s more lap-friendly too, meaning it didn\u2019t wobble quite as much as other convertibles we\u2019ve tested. Plus, the color scheme is sharp as hell. It really looks a lot like the Google Pixelbook, but that\u2019s perfectly fine, as imitation is considered the highest form of flattery.\n\nGet the HP Chromebook X2 12-F014DX from Amazon for $475\n\n7. Dell Chromebook 113180 83C80\n\nDell Chromebook 11 3180 83C80 (Photo: Dell)\n\nThe 11-inch Dell Chromebook is probably the most budget-friendly option on this list. The base configuration, which costs less than our target price, gets you 4GB of RAM and a Celeron N3060 processor. For $150 more, you can upgrade to a touchscreen and 32GB of storage.\n\nThe rugged design is really cool, as it's built to handle the daily abuses of life. The black plastic exterior hides fingerprint smudges and the rubber bumper along the edges of the Chromebook protect against unexpected falls.\n\nIt may not be the most powerful machine, but it's a great little laptop for writing papers and browsing the web. It's also really small and compact, making it the perfect travel companion. If you're a college student on a tight budget, you can't really get much better than this.\n\nGet the Dell Chromebook 11 3180 83C80 from Amazon for $163.99\n\n8. Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA\n\nAsus Chromebook Flip C302CA (Photo: ASUS)\n\nThis Asus is one swanky-looking Chromebook. Between the thin profile and silver shell, it looks suspiciously like the MacBook. I mean, isn't imitation the highest form of flattery? The posh design is cool and all, but let's discuss the guts.\n\nThe Flip earned a score of 367.79 in Basemark, which is a web-based application that evaluates performance. That's serious power. We weren't too surprised by that result, though. Our review unit had an Intel Core m3-6Y30 processor and 4GB RAM, a step-up from the usual Chromebook fare. We also discovered that the machine can handle up to fifteen open tabs at once. Multitaskers, get in line.\n\nThe superb 1080p display deserves its own call-out, too. It provides really crisp images. When I watched gameplay footage for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the rolling hills of Hyrule were so vividly green. The colors are rich and lovely, and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe only downside is the cost, as it's well above our target price. Most Chromebooks fall in the range of $199\u2013$250, with $300 being the sweet spot. If you're able to shell out the money, I'd spring for it. Chromebooks are evolving faster than ever, especially this new wave of 2-in-1's.\n\nGet the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA from Amazon for $470\n\n9. Acer Chromebook 11N7 C731T-C42N\n\nAcer Chromebook 11 (Photo: Acer)\n\nIf you're a bonafide klutz (like me), this durable Acer might be the laptop for you. I can't tell you how many times I've doused my keyboard in tea or water over the years, and if I'd had this one, it wouldn't have been an issue. This Acer delivers a military-grade chassis and unique \"gutter\" system, so it's pretty tough. Between the durable shell and water resistance, it's basically klutz-proof.\n\nAcer's gutter system drains spilled fluids out of the bottom of the Chromebook, so naturally, I had to try it out. I'm not sure what I expected, but this Acer continued to function after I purposefully dumped water onto the keyboard.\n\nBut what surprised us most was the fantastic battery life. When we put this Acer through our browsing test\u2014which continuously cycles through popular websites like Twitch and Facebook\u2014it lasted a total of eight hours. That's more than a full school day.\n\nThe Acer had a couple of drawbacks, though. It doesn't run Android apps, meaning you're at the mercy of the Google gods. In other words, you're missing out on a whole lot of games and utilities.\n\nThe other drawback was the poor performance. It's snappy enough when viewing videos or chatting in Slack, but it struggles with more than seven open tabs. So, if you're the type of person who likes to multitask, you might want to keep tabs on your tabs. Still, it's a good laptop for the low price, especially for an accident-prone middle school student.\n\nGet the Acer Chromebook 11 N7 C731T-C42N from Amazon for $320.93\n\n10. Samsung Chromebook Plus\n\nSamsung Chromebook Plus (Photo: Samsung)\n\nLike the Asus Chromebook Flip, this 2-in-1 has an eye-catching design. Unlike most Chromebooks, which are pretty nondescript, this one has a bit of flair to it. Made of magnesium alloy, it looks and feels like a premium machine, and the monochrome Google Chrome logo really pops against the silver lid. The body is also sleek and lightweight but has a little give.\n\nThe 1600p display is top-notch, too. When I watched the Ready Player One trailer, the deep purples of the fantastical worlds inside OASIS, a virtual reality video game, were sharp and vivid. There's a glossy finish, though, so you're going to be dealing with some reflection in brighter environments. The reflection is especially noticeable when the Samsung is in tablet mode.\n\nThe battery life was disappointing, but not surprising, as the high-resolution touchscreen display is a big power suck. The Samsung fizzled out in about five hours, which is below-average for a Chromebook. You're going to want to keep the power adapter nearby.\n\nFor a Chromebook, the Samsung is expensive. You're getting an excellent display, but the price is a little steep. If you're working with a flexible budget and plan on using the machine for casual use, I'd say go for it.\n\nGet the Samsung Chromebook Plus from Amazon for $499\n\n11. Lenovo Flex 11 Chromebook\n\nLenovo Flex 11 Chromebook (Photo: Lenovo)\n\nThere's no point in beating around the bush here. The Lenovo Flex is one ugly machine. It has the modern 2-in-1 design, which is nice, but it looks like one of those bulky business laptops from the early 2000s. Between the ultra-thick bezels and dark grey exterior, it's super plain. But Chromebooks aren't known for their beautiful designs, and at least it's plenty rugged.\n\nLike the Acer, this Lenovo has a spill-resistant keyboard/trackpad; overall, it's very durable. There's a 5 mm rubber ring surrounding the machine, protecting it from unexpected bumps and shocks. So, ideally, this laptop should survive all but the most severe tantrums. There's a trade-off for all that protection, though: For an 11-inch Chromebook, this Lenovo is seriously bulky. I didn't mind lugging it about, but hauling a three-pound Chromebook every day isn't really ideal, either.\n\nGet the Lenovo Flex 11 Chromebook from Amazon for $277.99\n\n12. Dell Chromebook 3189 2-in-1(4GB RAM, 32GB Storage)\n\nDell Chromebook 3189 2-in-1 (4GB RAM, 32GB Storage) (Photo: Dell)\n\nThe Dell is another unassuming-looking 2-in-1 that bends back into tablet and tent modes. While it's not the lightest or most attractive Chromebook we've seen, it's sturdy enough for K-12 education environments. The plastic lid is scratch-resistant, the keyboard is sealed against fluids, and the rounded edges are rubberized. The design is a bit utilitarian, but that seems to be the norm for Chromebooks.\n\nThe full-sized keyboard offers a great typing experience. Most Chromebook keyboards feel tiny and cramped, but not the Dell. The keys feel firm under my fingertips and there's plenty of space between them. I didn't notice any creaking of the chassis either, so it appears to be well-built. I clicked my way to 76 words per minute, too, which is close to my average of 80 (wpm).\n\nIt's not the kind of machine that screams luxury. It's the kind of machine that favors practicality over luxury. This Dell might be a good laptop for a college student on a budget.\n\nGet the Dell Chromebook 3189 2-in-1 (4GB RAM, 32GB Storage) from Amazon for $258.49\n\n13. Acer Chromebook 11CB311-8H-C5DV\n\nAcer Chromebook 11 CB311-8H-C5DV (Photo: Acer)\n\nWith its gorgeous color scheme, snappy performance, and low price point, this Acer really stands apart from the crowd. The diverse selection of ports is awesome, too. Not only are you getting both USB-A and USB-C ports, but they're also all 3.1, meaning faster transfer speeds.\n\nBut the real star of the show here is the battery life. In our testing, the Acer breathed its last breath in a little over eight hours, which is more than a full workday. While we like the lightweight form factor and rugged design, it's not a perfect product.\n\nThe matte display is dimmer than we like. It tops out at 228 nits at max brightness, which isn't very bright by modern standards. The audio quality is also underwhelming. Lower tones aren't as punchy as they are on other laptops.\n\nIf you can live with these trade-offs, it's a good option for the budget-conscious buyer.\n\nGet the Acer Chromebook 11 CB311-8H-C5DV from Amazon for $239.99\n\n14. Acer Chromebook 15 (CB515-1HT-P39B)\n\nAcer Chromebook 15 (CB515-1HT-P39B) (Photo: Acer)\n\nWhen it comes to the Chromebook 15, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck. The aluminum and plastic build feels surprisingly sturdy and there's hardly any flex in the chassis or display. It's also plenty fast for basic tasks like surfing the web or checking e-mail.\n\nWeighing just a little under five pounds, it's definitely on the heavy side. However, that's not too surprising, given its super-size screen. Speaking of the screen, it's not the brightest or most colorful we've ever seen, but it's 1080p and that's pretty rare on a Chromebook.\n\nIt's not great for multitasking, either. Our test unit had 4GB of RAM and that wasn't enough to keep up with my usual workload. If you have more than seven tabs open, you can expect things to get sluggish. We'd recommend starting with at least 8GB of RAM.\n\nIf playing media isn't a priority, this Acer is perfect for the average user.\n\nGet the Acer Chromebook 15 (CB515-1HT-P39B) from Amazon for $306.98\n\n15. Acer Chromebook Spin 11 (CP311-1HN-C2DV)\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 11 (CP311-1HN-C2DV) (Photo: Acer)\n\nThis sleek convertible has a lot of cool features. Thanks to the 360-degree hinge, you can swing the screen around and use it as a tablet or prop it up like a painter's easel. The included stylus is nice as well, especially if you're big on doodling.\n\nThe most surprising thing about this tiny laptop is how durable it is. Between the rubberized bumper around the bottom and the polycarbonate plastic, it's basically klutz-proof. The touchscreen is also coated in Corning Gorilla Glass, which protects it against scratches.\n\nThe only drawback is that the screen is really small. It's not the best screen for watching streaming services on, but the picture quality is still acceptable. If you're looking for a super rugged machine, you can't get much better than this.\n\nGet the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 (CP311-1HN-C2DV) from Amazon for $434.99\n\nHow We Test\n\nThe Tester\n\nI\u2019m Ashley Barry-Biancuzzo, the former laptop reviewer here at Reviewed and an editor of our Best Right Now buying guides. Not only am I a huge fan of Chromebooks, but I also use one as my everyday laptop. They\u2019re great because they\u2019re largely virus-free and have fantastic battery life.\n\nThe Tests\n\nOur tests for these devices aren\u2019t based purely on processing power. Instead, we look at the overall usability of the laptop, which also depends on the quality of the screen, the keyboard, what interfaces it offers and many other factors. We test all of these factors and assign a score for each. Then, we rate the overall usability of the laptop as a combination of all of these factors by creating an overall weighted score.\n\nFirst, we look at how well each laptop performs. Because the laptops in this guide are mostly designed for running web applications like Google Docs, we use two web benchmarks: Basemark and Speedometer. These test the processing power of the laptop in a web browser: for all of them, we used Google Chrome.\n\nMost laptop displays do well in a dark room, but what about outdoors? Is a glossy screen better than a matte one? To figure out this information, we test the brightness on the display. We do this with a CS-200: it\u2019s a handheld device that measures luminance. We measure the white levels and black levels at max brightness and then again at 50% brightness.\n\nNext, we tested the battery life of each laptop to see how long you can use them for between charges. With their displays adjusted to a brightness of 200 nits, we set them to continuously cycle through popular websites, simulating the way you would use the laptop when idly browsing the web. We also look at how comfortable the screen is to look at, how easy the keyboard is to type on, and other factors.\n\nWhat You Should Know About Chromebooks\n\nChromebooks are inexpensive machines that run ChromeOS (aka Google\u2019s default browser). Equipped with low-power processors, Chromebooks typically have good battery life and are fanless. That said, they\u2019re not the most powerful laptops in the world. They can handle everyday tasks like browsing the web or checking email, but that\u2019s about it. You also need a stable WiFi connection because Chromebooks are web-based, so there\u2019s not much you can do offline.\n\nWhat Type of Laptop Should I Get?\n\nThere\u2019s the traditional clamshell, which can only be opened 180-degrees. These laptops have been around for ages and are popular among college students. Then there\u2019s the 2-in-1 convertible, which can be folded or flipped. You can flip the screen around and use it as a tablet or prop it up like a painter\u2019s easel. This kind of laptop is great for the regular traveler, as they\u2019re really versatile and lightweight.\n\nDoes Display Size Matter?\n\nIt depends on what you plan on doing with your Chromebook. A Chromebook with an 11-inch display is going to be much lighter than a 15- or 17-inch. So, if you need something that\u2019s light and portable, a larger display isn\u2019t going to cut it. That said, bigger displays have higher resolutions and that means a sharper picture. If you\u2019re a photo or video editor, you\u2019ll probably want a bigger screen so you can see all those minute details. If you just need a lightweight machine for research or writing papers on, an 11-inch display should do you just fine, especially if you\u2019re taking it from class-to-class.\n\nWindows vs Chromebook vs Mac: Which one is best?\n\nIf you're on the fence between a Chromebook and a Windows laptop or MacBook, you're not alone. Though the best choice will come down to your personal needs, there are a few easy ways to narrow things down.\n\nThe first is your budget. Most Chromebooks cost well under $1,000, outside of one or two very high-end (and largely overpriced) premium Chromebook models. The best Chromebooks tend to hover around the $600 range, while you can't even get a new MacBook for that price.\n\nThe second area to consider is what you'll use the laptop for. Chromebooks are great at web-based tasks, including streaming video, writing documents in cloud-based programs like Microsoft Office and Google Docs, web browsing and your e-mail. Windows laptops also excel at these, but they can also run offline Windows programs more effectively. Chromebooks also have Android app compatibility now, so there are many more offline options, but if you have a specific offline program you prefer on Windows, it may not be available when running Chrome OS.\n\nThe last area is battery life. Windows and Mac laptops may be able to get you 7 or 8 hours of battery life under heavy use, but rarely more than that. Chromebooks don't need to do as much heavy lifting, so it's more common to see 10 to 12 hours of battery life in a single charge.\n\nIf you prize portability, are on a tight budget, and like the extra battery life, a Chromebook is a great choice. If you need a little more flexibility in terms of apps but still want to stick to a budget, check out our roundup of the best laptops under $1,000.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
