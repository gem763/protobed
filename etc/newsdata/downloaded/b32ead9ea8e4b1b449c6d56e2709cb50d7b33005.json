Even though some analysts believe the market outlook for cobalt is picking up, there remains some uncertainty about supply and demand for the scantily traded metal, and some shareholders now say they will support the buyout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the deal of the year,\u201d said Etienne Guicherd, a portfolio manager in Paris at the multibillion dollar fund, Amiral Gestion. \u201cI\u2019m still a bit disappointed.\u201d\n\nBut Guicherd, who said his fund controls around three per cent of Cobalt 27\u2019s shares, said he would drop his opposition to the deal because of the increased cash component, and other factors including a reduction in the exit payout for management.\n\nAlthough Guicherd said he wanted more cash, the investment represented a tiny fraction of his overall portfolio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not meaningful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to hire a bunch of consultants.\u201d\n\nAnson Funds, another investor that had initially opposed the buyout, also announced it would support the deal, calling it a \u201cfair price.\u201d\n\nBut several retail investors who spoke to the Financial Post expressed anger at management for seeking to sell its assets at all. The stock had traded as high as $12 in mid-2018, and above $6 within the last 12 months, but then crashed as cobalt prices declined, which recently started to rise again.\n\n\u201cI looked at it as a long-term call,\u201d said one retail investor. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have an expiry option, why does Cobalt 27 have to do anything?\u201d\n\nI looked at it as a long-term call retail investor\n\nHe said he had objected to the pay outs, including an estimated $7-million package for the company\u2019s chief executive Anthony Milewski \u2014 who previously worked at Pala. In its latest announcement, the company said it cut the cash portion of the change of control payments by 46 per cent, but did not provide many other details.\n\nCobalt 27 Capital Corp. formed in 2017 and amassed the largest stockpile of physical cobalt in the world, and then bought up streams and royalties on mines such as the Voisey\u2019s Bay Expansion in Labrador, from which it would receive 32.6 per cent of all cobalt produced.\n\nThe company also purchased several nickel assets, in various stages of development, including a stake in the Ramu mine in Papua New Guinea and in nickel development projects in Canada.\n\nPala is proposing to purchase the physical cobalt and the Voisey\u2019s Bay cobalt royalty; and it would take a 9.9 per cent stake in the company\u2019s nickel assets, which would be placed in a new entity, to be called Nickel 28.\n\nAnalysts appeared split on the deal.\n\nDavid Talbot, of Eight Capital, kept a price target of $7.50 on the stock in a note published on Tuesday, and said the $4 per share offer means Pala is paying $341.5 million in cash for assets that the company valued at $465.9 million as of the company\u2019s June 30 financial statements, which he pegged at $418 million. Plus, he noted the price of cobalt has risen 22 per cent since June.\n\nOne question relates to the value of the nickel assets.\n\n\u201cIf those assets were in a well-capitalized company \u2026 they might be worth as much as $4.10 per share,\u201d Talbot wrote. \u201cHowever, we cannot ignore that the market hasn\u2019t given the stock much more than a 30 cent valuation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Andrew Wong, of RBC Dominion Securities, wrote that Pala was paying a slight premium, pegging the value of the cobalt assets plus debt at $3.25 per share compared to the $4 per share being offered. He put a $5 price target on the stock.\n\nMeanwhile, there remain differing views on the outlook for cobalt.\n\nIn early September, analysts at Citi Research wrote that the demand for electric vehicle-related metals isn\u2019t going away, and called cobalt \u201cone of the best long term buys \u2026 over the next 12 months.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, analysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote in a research note that they believed cobalt was oversupplied until 2023.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a chance in this market,\u201d said the retail investor who opposed a sale and wanted to keep Cobalt 27 shares long term, \u201cthat people say, \u2018you know what forget it, this is a disaster, I\u2019ll take the cash.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Several retail investors who spoke to the Financial Post expressed anger at management for seeking to sell its assets at all", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cobalt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
