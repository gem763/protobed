On Tuesday the pro-life organization and its supporters gathered on Capitol Hill to announce the theme for this year\u2019s event: \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-life is Pro-Woman.\u201d\n\nJeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, right, and Serrin Foster of Feminists for Life, spoke on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to announce the them of this year\u2019s event set for January 24, 2020. (Penny Starr/Breitbart News)\n\nMarch for Life President Jeanne Mancini said there are confusing messages about what it means to be pro-woman, with Planned Parenthood and other abortion advocates claiming that choosing to end the life of an unborn baby somehow empowers women when the opposite is true.\n\n\u201cChoosing life is empowering and ennobling,\u201d Mancini said.\n\nAnd the left now embraces abortion as something that\u2019s not only routine but worth celebrating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone from \u2018safe and rare\u2019 to \u2018shout your abortion,\u2019\u201d Mancini said.\n\nSpeakers also said that the message that somehow motherhood limits a woman is also wrong if that woman facing an unplanned pregnancy gets the support she needs during and after her baby is born.\n\nThis year\u2019s march also coincides with the 100 anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution that granted women the right to vote. And those women who fought for the right to vote, including Susan B. Anthony, Alice Paul, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, were passionately in favor of protecting the unborn, Mancini and other speakers at the event said.\n\nIn a video created to promote the March, which has taken place every year since the United States Supreme Court ruled to make abortion on demand the law of the land in Roe v. Wade in 1973, the narrator speaks out about being a woman:\n\nI love being a woman. When I say I love being a woman I mean all of me. My mind, my lips, my soul, my hips, my fertility. Inner, outer beauty, and all the things that make me she. We women are strong, intuitive, compassionate, and valuable. Smart, caring and nurturing, capable and powerful. We are lawyers, mothers, poets, politicians and teachers. Doctors, daughters, wives, artists, sisters. We are leaders.\n\nThe woman said we should celebrate \u201cour founding feminists\u201d for fighting for the right to vote and for the unborn.\n\n\u201cThey called abortion the ultimate exploitation of women,\u201d the women in the video said.\n\nShe also praised \u201cJane Roe\u201d or Norma McCorvey, the woman in the landmark abortion decision who came to believe abortion was wrong and \u201cspent the rest of her life trying to undo the law.\u201d\n\nThe woman in the video notes that it cannot be pro-woman to abort more than 30 million female babies since the High Court\u2019s ruling.\n\nShe challenged pro-life advocates to use their ancestors as inspiration for this year\u2019s March, which continues to have the same goal year after year: \u201cMake abortion unthinkable in our society.\u201d\n\n\u201cLadies let\u2019s fight like them and be a voice for the voiceless,\u201d the woman says.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "The 2020 March for Life takes place January 24, 2020 on the National Mall and the theme is \u201cLife Empowers: Pro-life is Pro-Woman.\u201d", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/March-for-Life-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
