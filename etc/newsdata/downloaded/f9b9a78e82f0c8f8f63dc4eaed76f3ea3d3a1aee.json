At first, the team assumed that it might be able to build a business selling that technology to other publishers. After all, Vox Media and The Washington Post are both trying to do something similar with their content management systems.\n\nSo it was surprising to hear Betts say that FT Strategy is actually \u201ca pure consulting business.\u201d\n\nAsked whether The FT might eventually start selling a tech product as well, he replied, \u201cNever say never about the technology dimension, but I think as we did our market research and started talking to customers and looking more at the technological landscape out there, we realized that over the years, many of the elements of the technology we have built have become commoditized.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s a technology stack that publishers can buy off-the-shelf that can meet all their needs (there\u2019s at least one startup called The News Project trying to piece that stack together).\n\nBut Betts argued, \u201cEven if you go and buy best-of-breed technology, that doesn\u2019t mean you can assembly it in the right way to make it useful and meaningful to scale and grow direct-to-consumer revenues. And most importantly it doesn\u2019t mean that you know how to operate it with teams and how to actually use it to successfully scale and grow your business.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what FT Strategies is trying to provide. In fact, Betts said the company has already been quietly testing out the idea in beta and built up a customer list that includes Bonnier, The Business of Fashion, Penguin Random House and the V&A \u2014 so not just news companies, but also a book publisher and an art and design museum.\n\n\u201cI believe that the capabilities that we\u2019e built, clearly they are salient to other news publishers, but I believe that they span far beyond that,\u201d Betts explained.\n\nHe went on to argue that FT Strategies could potentially work with any company that\u2019s \u201ceither facing disruption as the news media industry has\u201d or that\u2019s in a sector that\u2019s part of the broader direct-to-consumer trend \u2014 basically, any company that needs help figuring out \u201chow do we market to individuals, how do we build relationships to individuals, how do we leverage those relationships both so that the consumers have the most positive and engaging experience with our products and to maximize revenue.\u201d\n\nAs for whether any of these business might be leery about giving another company \u2014 and, in some cases, a competitor \u2014 access to their customer data, Betts said that philosophically, the FT believes that \u201ca healthy paid content ecosystem is good for the FT and it\u2019s good for all the publishers that participate in it.\u201d\n\nMore concretely, he said his team is \u201cvery clear internally about having the Chinese walls and professional standards for FT Strategy that ensures the right levels of confidentiality of clients\u2019 data [so] their confidential information doesn\u2019t leak back into the core operation.\u201d", "description": "As more and more news businesses turn to paywalls and subscriptions, The Financial Times looks like an early model and success story \u2014 a few months ago the organization announced that it\u2019s passed 1 million paying readers, with digital subscribers accounting for more than three-fourths of its circulation.
