So far, there's only been one technical glitch (back in July, which delayed the launch of this unmanned spacecraft from the Sriharikota space centre near Chennai, Tamil Nadu), but the journey for Chandrayaan-2 has been smooth so far. \"It will be a terrifying moment for us. Everybody\u2019s eyes would be glued to their consoles. The telemetry parameters will keep telling us that we are going in the right direction, but at the same time, there will be a lot of anxiety about what will happen in the next moment,\u201d ISRO chairman K Sivan told Hindustan Times.\n\nAs the nation counts down to the final spectacle tonight, we look at what exactly this mission is, and why it's important for India:\n\nWhat is Chandrayaan-2?\n\nAfter India's first moon mission in 2008 called Chandrayaan-1, Chandrayaan-2 is India's second lunar expedition but the first one that will actually land on the moon, albeit at a completely unexplored section of South Polar region. Carried out by the ISRO, the biggest Indian government space agency, this mission not only aims to increase the Indian footprint in space, but is also expected to surpass international space aspirations.\n\nOn July 22, India's Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, GSLV MkIII-M1, successfully launched Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft into the earth's orbit and, on August 20, it entered the moon's orbit. The ISRO chairman K Sivan calls this the \u201cmost complex mission ever undertaken by ISRO\u201d and describes the upcoming final moments the \u201cmost terrifying 15 minutes\u201d.\n\nWhy is it a significant moment for India?\n\nChandrayaan-2 is seen as a major milestone for India because while a Lunar Orbit Insertion (an operation of adjusting the spacecraft's momentum to allow stable orbit around a planet, moon or a celestial body) has already been accomplished by Chandrayaan-I in 2008-2009, this first-ever soft-landing will make the country the fourth in the world\u2014following Russia, the US, and China\u2014to do so.\n\nThe mission is also significant considering climate change is wreaking havoc on our natural resources. \u201cMinerals on the Earth are fast depleting and moon can be looked at as a future stockpile, especially when it comes to Helium 3,\u201d Ajay Lele, a senior fellow at the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses, told Hindustan Times. \u201cHelium 3 is rare on Earth [but] is found abundantly on moon. Theoretically, it can be used as fuel in nuclear reactors instead of plutonium etc and just one aircraft of Helium 3 would be enough to solve the power crisis of the world for a decade.\u201d\n\nThe next step for ISRO is a $1.4 billion-worth Gaganyaan mission, a homegrown space operation that will take three astronauts (at least one of which is supposed to be a woman) into the orbit.\n\nWhat is going to unfold tonight?\n\nTonight, landing module Vikram, which has already been in the moon's orbit for the last three days, will be travelling at about 6 km per second\u201421,600 km per hour! Within the final 15 minutes of descent, it\u2019s supposed to bring its speed to 2 metres per second (7km/hour) for a safe landing. This is supposed to be the most crucial part of the operation since, in the past, there have been failures and crash-landings. Of the total 109 missions to the moon from across the world, 41 have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe 15-minute landing is new to ISRO. \u201cIt is for the first time we are going to another body where there is no atmosphere and using the propulsion system we will have to break the velocity and bring the vehicle safely to soft land. To achieve this we will have to balance between the gravity and thrust. So we have to modulate the thrust of the engine,\" Sivan told News18.\n\nAround three hours post landing, Pragyan, the six-wheeled robotic rover, will eject out of the lander, and roam the moon\u2019s surface and collect data. The shadowed south pole of the moon is estimated to hold about 100 million tonnes of water ice in its craters, and the findings by Chandrayaan-2 will massively help a manned NASA mission to this side in 2024.\n\nBoth Vikram and Pragyan are designed to last 14 days while the main spacecraft will continue to orbit the moon for at least a year.\n\nHow can you see it?\n\nWhile ISRO will be hosting Prime Minister Narendra Modi to watch the moon landing at its headquarters in Bengaluru\u2014along with 60 students from across the country who won a space quiz conducted by ISRO to get this opportunity\u2014many of us will be confined to our screens.
