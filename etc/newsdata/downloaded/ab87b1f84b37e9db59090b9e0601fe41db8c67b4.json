Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)\n\nThe central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.\n\nA mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds.\n\n\"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.
