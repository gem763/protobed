Vahaamahina sees red after an elbow on Aaron Wainwright. Don't think there can be any complaints with that.

They had some good structure today,\u2019 Gatland added.\n\n\u2018Losing becomes a habit but so does winning and we\u2019re in that winning habit at the moment.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re a good team with some quality players and we know the strength in depth they have in France.\n\n\u2018But the important thing is we\u2019re not going home tomorrow.
