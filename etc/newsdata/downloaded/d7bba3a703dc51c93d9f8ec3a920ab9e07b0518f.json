She paired the ensemble with slicked-back, wet-looking hair, blue contact lenses, and transparent sandals to complete the look. The media mogul famously achieved her extremely tiny waist with the help of an ultra-cinched corset. She later said of the corset that she had \"never felt pain like that\" in her life.\n\nRabbani and Solimene Photography/Getty Images More\n\n\"Like the corset, underwear, all that vibe, I just feel like I just went through this transition of being rapper, and lookin' at all these girls,\" said Kanye. \"I didn't realize that that was affecting like my soul and my spirit.\" He also wanted Kim to know that he wasn't really into Kim wearing revealing clothing, with Kanye claiming he's \"someone that's married and in love and the father of what's about to be four kids.\"\n\n\"A corset is like a form of underwear. It's hot. It's like, it's hot for who, though?\" added Kanye.\n\nKim wasn't especially happy with Kanye's comments, especially as they came the night before she was to debut her look at the Met Gala.\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian's Admits She Was Prepared to Pee Herself at the Met Gala\n\n\"The night before you\u2019re going to come in here and say you\u2019re not into the corset look? You\u2019re giving me really bad anxiety... I don\u2019t need any more negative energy.\" Kanye wasn't content to let the issue go, despite how visibly upset Kim had gotten during their argument.\n\n\"You are my wife and it affects me when pictures are too sexy,\" he insisted.\n\n\"You built me up to be a sexy person and have confidence! Just because you're on a journey and you're in a transformation, doesn't mean I'm in the same spot with you,\" Kim clapped back \u2013 and it appeared the two had reached something of an understanding. But despite the fact that the couple obviously ended up getting along and reaching a resolution, with Kim ultimately debuting her Mugler look, not everyone was happy with the words exchanged during the episode.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians fans immediately took to Twitter to voice their displeasure about Kanye, calling him a \"hypocrite\" after hearing his side of the disagreement. In the past, Kanye had actually thrown out all of Kim's old clothes when they got together to help her with something of a style makeover \u2013 and ever since, Kim has cultivated a certain sexy image.\n\nIt\u2019s funny how Kanye has encouraged Kim for years & only for him to turn out as an hypocrite! \u2014 Rogue (@tayoisrogue) October 14, 2019\n\nBruh wtf Kanye is a hypocrite for real on this one pic.twitter.com/vh4G9puKXT \u2014 JOHN VAN DEL (@officaljaylee3) October 14, 2019\n\nThe whole Met Gala segment was cringe. When Kim said her and Kanye talked of a solo Vogue cover and their dreams coming true. \ud83e\udd23 BUT I was impressed with Kim telling Kanye \u2018you\u2019re on a journey. I\u2019m not\u2019 when he spoke of her sexy image. #KUWTK \u2014 Jamini\u2122\ufe0f (@JLW1006) October 14, 2019\n\nKim dragging Kanye about her met gala dress!!! Kanye said Kim is looking \u201ctoo sexy\u201d and She was like no sir, not today.\n\n\n\nAlso, I love how respectful they are towards each other even when disagreeing.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Tshepo (@TshepoL_) October 14, 2019", "description": "On a recent episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kanye West opened up about finding wife Kim Kardashian's Met Gala look \"too sexy.\"", "authors": ["Brittany Vincent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lqRrVwxb.J_G.DeGL9Di4A--~B/aD01OTQ7dz0zOTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/instyle_846/1a5116fb04fac04653fd181b0b2145a4", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
