In explaining the political utility of forgiveness, Tutu critiqued the punitive structure of the Nuremberg trials, as well as the suggestion of general amnesty for crimes against humanity committed by the South African government and its institutions during the apartheid regime.\n\nThe crucial step to finding that third way, Tutu suggested, was to for both the subjugated and the oppressor to find common humanity in one another. \u201cWhen we want to give high praise to someone,\u201d wrote Tutu, we say, \u2018Yu, u nobuntu\u2019\u2026It is to say, \u2018My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours.\u2019 We belong in a bundle of life.\u201d In order for that common humanity to be recognized, and for a new political environment to be formed, forgiveness was a prerequisite. From Tutu\u2019s perspective, hatred and the desire for vengeance was a burdensome obstacle to this goal, but forgiveness released the burden to God. In his own words, \u201cForgiving means abandoning your right to pay back the perpetrator in his own coin, but it is a loss that liberates the victim.\u201d\n\nWhile Tutu\u2019s logic held value from a philosophical perspective, and perhaps a personalized spiritual one, his logic has rather unfortunate effects once folded into the bolus of white supremacy, or prescribed as an antidote in the aftermath of another white person killing a black person. See, for example, the trial of former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, recently convicted for the murder of Botham Jean.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGuyger, a white woman who made headlines for entering Jean\u2019s apartment (alleging she mistakenly believed she\u2019d entered her own), shooting him in the chest, and texting a partner on the force while Jean lay dying on the floor, was sentenced by Judge Tammy Kemp to 10 years in prison (with the possibility of parole after five).\n\nAfter the verdict was rendered, something strange began to happen. First, there came the image of one of the court bailiffs stroking Guyger\u2019s hair, a sight completely alien to black defendants convicted of even minor crimes. Then Brandt Jean, brother of the deceased Botham Jean, gave a victim impact statement in which he asked to hug the woman who killed his brother. The request was granted, and the two raced to embrace one another.\n\nThen \u2014 perhaps most shocking of all \u2014 Judge Tammy Kemp descended from the judge\u2019s bench, handed Guyger a Bible, and wrapped the convicted murderer in her arms. It\u2019s unclear whether Judge Kemp has ever done the same for any other murderer convicted in her courtroom.\n\nThe peculiar nature of this spectacle was immediately reframed as a radical act of love and Christian faith, echoing the public forgiveness offered by bereaved family members to mass murderer and white supremacist Dylann Roof, who was convicted of shooting and killing nine worshippers at Emanuel AME church in South Carolina. Superhero film icon Chris Evans called Jean\u2019s embrace of Guyger \u201ceasily one of the most beautiful things I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) described it as \u201ca beautiful, powerful example of Christian love [and] forgiveness,\u201d and Trump-appointed former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley hailed the display as \u201can amazing example of faith, love, and forgiveness.\u201d\n\nWhile the celebration of this display echoed across the cybersphere, no such attention was paid to the exhortations of Allison Jean, Botham Jean\u2019s mother, who accused the City of Dallas of corrupting the justice process, and called for police to receive more rigorous training. No movie star called that statement \u201cbeautiful.\u201d No politician called her pleas \u201cpowerful\u201d or \u201camazing.\u201d\n\nAnd this is, ultimately, the landscape where the fool\u2019s gold of forgiveness is found. When black lives are seen as disposable, forgiveness can (and often does) function as a tool of psychological pressure \u2014 not only for victims and their family members at the hands of the state (and of white supremacist violence), but for black Americans as a whole.\n\nThe celebration of forgiveness is a subtle message that not only absolves perpetrators of their sins, but demands victims let go of the anger and frustration born out of a system where a white police officer kills a black man in his own home and is treated far less harshly than, say, a black woman who fires a warning shot in self-defense.\n\nIf forgiveness were such a powerful and necessary thing, where were was this widespread display when black spree killers John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo were convicted for their crimes?\n\nTutu may have been correct that forgiveness is an effective personal means of releasing trauma inflicted by people and by systems. But when it comes to the matter of liberation, the man was dead wrong. When a Ted Cruz or a Nikki Haley publicly celebrates black forgiveness this way, the memo to black Americans is not only to follow suit in forgiveness of the systems that oppress them. It is a subtle message that they ought to forget.", "description": "Five years after South Africa elected Nelson Mandela president, effectively writing the first chapter of the post-apartheid era, Archbishop Desmond Tutu penned his own seminal work, No Future Without Forgiveness.
