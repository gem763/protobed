Mnuchin, among others.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nMr. Kushner, 38, married the president\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, in 2009. They both worked for Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential election campaign before joining his administration in 2017 as senior advisers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
