After all, this is the time when investors get to know which stock to settle on and which ones to walk out on, based on a company\u2019s earnings scorecard.\n\nWhile appraising earnings performance, there are various factors investors normally take a look at. But among them, earnings beat seems to be the most intriguing driver of stock movement other than factors like earnings growth or acceleration.\n\nInside Earnings Beat\n\nInvestors normally look to position themselves ahead of time and hunt for stocks that are likely to spring up an astounding performance. After much brainstorming, Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies. These estimates act as investment leads.\n\nA positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate. Historically, if a company\u2019s earnings manage to beat market expectations, its stock surges post release.\n\nWhat Makes Earnings Beat Superior to Earnings Growth\n\nA 20% earnings rise (though apparently looks good) doesn\u2019t tell you everything about the company\u2019s performance. This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters, raising questions over the company\u2019s fundamentals.\n\nAlso, seasonal fluctuations come into the play. If a company\u2019s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong, then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline. In such cases, growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts combine their understanding and a company\u2019s guidance when formulating an earnings estimate. Thus, outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company\u2019s own expectation as well as market perception. Of course, this gives you a clear picture of the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nHow to Find Those Star Performers?\n\nNow, since it is tough to foresee if a company will beat or miss in the upcoming earnings release, investors can review the earnings surprise history. An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst in sending a stock higher. It indicates the company\u2019s ability to surpass estimates. And investors generally believe that the company will have the same trick up its sleeve or in other words is smart enough to beat on earnings next time.\n\nThe Winning Strategy\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise, we chose the followingas our primary screening parameters.\n\nLast EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10%: Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20%: We lifted the bar for outperformance slight higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20%.\n\nAverage EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20%: This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger.\n\nIn addition, we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise.\n\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Only companies with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating can get through.
