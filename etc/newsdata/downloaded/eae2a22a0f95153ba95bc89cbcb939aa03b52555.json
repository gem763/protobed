USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Rapper 21 Savage believes immigrants like him who lived in America illegally as children should automatically become U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Grammy-nominated artist who this year was held in federal immigration detention told The Associated Press on Thursday night that such immigrants also shouldn\u2019t have to endure the lengthy process to obtain visas. He spoke in an exclusive interview before receiving an award from the National Immigration Law Center.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a child, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, you grow up and got to figure it out. Can\u2019t get a job. Can\u2019t get a license. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones who became successful. It\u2019s a lot of people who can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nNILC honored 21 Savage for being an advocate for immigrant justice. He was arrested in February in what U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said was a targeted operation over his expired visa.\n\nHe spent 10 days in a detention center in south Georgia before being released.\n\nThe Atlanta-based rapper, whose given name is She\u2019yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph, is a British citizen who moved to the U.S. when he was 7. His visa expired in 2006, but his lawyers had said that wasn\u2019t his fault.\n\n\u201cWhen you ain\u2019t got no choice, you should be exempt,\u201d 21 Savage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was 30, woke up and moved over here. I\u2019ve been here since I was like 7 or 8, probably younger than that. I didn\u2019t know anything about visas and all that. I just knew we were moving to a new place.\u201d\n\nHe said people in his shoes should be made citizens.\n\n\u201cI feel like we should be exempt,\u201d he reiterated. \u201cI feel like we should automatically become citizens.\u201d\n\n21 Savage attends NILC Courageous Luminaires Awards Honoring 21 Savage on October 03, 2019 in Los Angeles, California.

Her activist organization led a coalition to facilitate his release from ICE custody.\n\n\u201cThe conversation primarily revolved around Latin immigrants,\u201d she continued. \u201cHis detention really pushed a national conversation and it made us talk about what\u2019s happening with black people who are undocumented. All the black people in America aren\u2019t just citizens.\u201d\n\n21 Savage was thankful for the award, but said there are countless immigrants who are battling to stay in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe got a fight that we need to continue in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t over yet. Even after everything is cool with me, we still have to fight and help people who can\u2019t fight for themselves.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/04/21-savage-undocumented-kids-should-automatically-become-us-citizens/3863208002/", "description": "Rapper 21 Savage believes immigrants like him who lived in America illegally as children should automatically become U.S. citizens.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published A.M.
