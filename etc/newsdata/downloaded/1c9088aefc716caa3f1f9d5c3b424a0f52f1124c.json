Soon after pushing a wheelbarrow across the stage as part of the show, the bear suddenly latched onto his handler, dragging him to the ground.\n\nHuge circus bear attacks trainer as \u2018terrified\u2019 families scramble to escape pic.twitter.com/AmWo4mMvXmhttps://t.co/HPQIIBGsBl \u2014 Atlantide (@Atlantide4world) October 24, 2019\n\nWith no barriers between the audience and the stage, after a moment of shock, attendees scrambled to gather their children and belongings and flee the venue, amid gasps and screams.\n\nAn assistant quickly came to the trainer\u2019s aid, kicking the animal in an attempt to stop the attack, but the bear did not appear fazed and was ultimately subdued by electric shock, one witness told news site Gazeta.ru.\n\nFortunately for all involved, there were no serious injuries to trainer, bear or bystander, thanks in part to the fact that the animal wore a muzzle on stage.\n\nAlso on rt.com RT team nearly attacked by POLAR BEAR while making wildlife film in Russia (VIDEO)\n\nThe director of the circus told Gazeta.ru that while neither the trainer nor the animal were hurt, the bear number would no longer be a part of the show. He then appeared to blame the incident on the circus-goers, who he said violated the rules by using camera flashes during the performance.\n\nEdgard Zapashny, famed Russian ringmaster and director of the Zapashny Brothers & Great Moscow Circus, said that while such attacks are not entirely out of the norm, added human error is usually part of the equation as well.\n\n\u201cAn animal is an animal, they attack and will attack. This is normal,\u201d Zapashny told Russia\u2019s National News Service. \u201cBut under each attack there is a certain error of the person himself, which means that he did not see something, could not get ahead of the animal\u2019s thought, did not have time to react, to stop the attack.\u201d\n\nSome work will probably be done on the mistakes, and the trainer will draw conclusions for himself, but I know for sure that neither the bear nor the person were injured in this attack.\n\nZapashny, however, noted the bear appeared \u201cgood, big\u201d and \u201cplump,\u201d suggesting it was well fed and in good health.\n\nAlso on rt.com Darwin Award wannabe?
