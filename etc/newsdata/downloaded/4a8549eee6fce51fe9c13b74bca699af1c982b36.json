The excavation is at one of the largest Pictish cemeteries in Scotland and placed in the ancient confederation's province of Fortriu\n\nSteve Birch, archaeological supervisor at the site, said: 'After I found some blackened patches in the ground I decided to trowel back at that level and to my astonishment, the ghostly outlines of a skeleton started to appear.\n\n'I was able to identify the spinal column with individual vertebrae and then moving up the body I uncovered the upper arms and shoulders, all of which were just black stains in the ground.\n\n'Eventually almost the whole outline of the skeleton could be seen, surrounded by the faint shadow of a coffin.\n\n'I have been an archaeologist for a long time and have made some important discoveries but this was a real eureka moment for me.'\n\nThe excavation is at one of the largest Pictish cemeteries in Scotland and placed in the ancient confederation's province of Fortriu.\n\nAerial photographs showed the outline of the ditches enclosing circular and square barrows of different sizes, with the skeleton within one of the large square enclosures.\n\nThe excavation is at one of the largest Pictish cemeteries in Scotland and placed in the ancient confederation's province of Fortriu.
