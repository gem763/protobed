Elizabeth Warren spotlighted her longstanding calls for the impeachment of President Trump at a campaign event on Wednesday, emphasizing, \u201cI hope we do this and I hope we do this quickly.\u201d\n\nBut, she also appeared to swipe at a rival Democrat vying for the White House \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 over his family\u2019s role in the Ukraine controversy that led the House of Representatives to launch a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nTaking questions from reporters following a town hall event in the first-in-the-nation presidential primary state of New Hampshire, the Massachusetts Democrat was asked if she would allow her vice president\u2019s child to serve on the board of a foreign company if she were president. Warren quickly answered, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nWARREN SURGES TO TIE BIDEN FOR TOP SPOT IN RACE FOR DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION\n\nWhen asked why, she said, in a rare moment where she appeared flustered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to go back and look at the details.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s comments came hours after the White House released a transcript of Trump\u2019s July call from this past July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The readout showed that the president asked Zelensky to investigate unsubstantiated allegations regarding the Biden family\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. However, the transcript did not suggest Trump leveraged U.S. military aid to Ukraine to obtain a \u201cpromise\u201d of an investigation.\n\nBiden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company owned by one of the country\u2019s oligarchs while Biden served in then-President Obama\u2019s administration. The then-vice president pushed in 2016 for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who was looking into corruption at that company. The prosecutor \u2013 who also had been widely accused of overlooking corruption in his own office \u2013 later was dismissed.\n\nTRUMP TRIES TO TURN TABLES ON DEMOCRATS IN UKRAINE CONTROVERSY\n\nTrump on Wednesday emphasized that there was no quid pro quo during his call with the Ukrainian president, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Trump spoke with reporters one day after House Democrats kicked off their formal impeachment inquiry. They\u2019re investigating whether the Republican president broke the law by allegedly asking a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 election by asking for Ukraine\u2019s assistance in investigating the Bidens.\n\nWarren kicked off her event \u2013 in front of a crowd estimated at 900 people by her campaign \u2013 by emphasizing, \u201cnobody\u2019s above the law... not even the president.\u201d And, she repeated her call that \u201cit is time for impeachment now.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts senator was one of the first 2020 Democrats to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. She did it this past spring, citing findings from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia report.\n\nAsked if she had any confidence that the GOP-controlled Senate would take action if the House impeached Trump, Warren told reporters, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the Senate will do under (Majority Leader) Mitch McConnel\u2019s control, but right now we have to do what is right regardless of the politics.\u201d\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nShe continued, \u201cDonald Trump had established he believed that he was above the law, and that\u2019s what the Mueller report shows, that he obstructed justice, and he was not held accountable by our Congress. So, he came back in the summer and did it again, inviting a foreign government to interfere in the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s stop in New Hampshire came a day after a new poll indicated that she held a slight two-point advantage over Biden in the crucial primary state.\n\nFox News' Tara Prindiville contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
