Graham Flanagan: I travelled a long way to try out Pollo Tropical, Florida\u2019s chicken chain. You can only get it in Florida. This is way better than anything I\u2019ve ever tasted from Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe first Pollo Tropical restaurant opened in Miami in 1988. Today, there are more than 140 Pollo Tropical locations in the Sunshine State. I tried Pollo Tropical in Tampa. So, the chicken-sandwich debate has been going on for a long time: Chick-fil-A and Popeyes, brands we\u2019ve known for years. I\u2019m here to showcase a chicken chain from the southern United States. Not too many people know about it. And I\u2019m gonna go see what their chicken sandwich is all about. Let\u2019s see what all I have here. I got the classic chicken sandwich, one chipotle chicken slider, an order of fries, an order of plantains, and I got a special, Mexican-style Coke. Let\u2019s take a look at this classic chicken sandwich. \u201cWarning: Contents of this box cause serious cravings.\u201d That is thick, man. Check that out. Oh, yeah. So, all their chicken here is marinated for 24 hours, at least. So, it\u2019s just this Kaiser roll, beautifully grilled white chicken, lettuce, and a tomato, in addition to this lemony citrus sauce. Let\u2019s give it a try. Everything about this is fresh. I don\u2019t feel the guilt that you feel when you have Chick-fil-A, in more ways than one. They have an awesome sauce selection here. I\u2019ll try a bite with the Guava BBQ. Mm. Oh man, yeah. Sauce is really good. We\u2019ll do the Poyo-Poyo. Whoop, don\u2019t drip. Oh man, that is spicy. This stuff is nuclear. The Poyo-Poyo blends with the house sauce; it\u2019s just a delicious combination. Pollo Tropical does make a fried-chicken sandwich, but it only comes in slider form. This is their crispy chicken chipotle slider. Oh, man. Dude. That was a chicken explosion just now. Tender. Flavorful. Fresh. It\u2019s fried, but it\u2019s not, like, too fried. It just adds a nice texture to it. It doesn\u2019t dominate the chicken like so many other fried-chicken sandwiches. They have gotta jump in this fried-chicken-sandwich game for, like, the full sandwich. They only sell the big one as grilled, and I get that \u2019cause that\u2019s their specialty, is grilled chicken. But they have got something really special going on here. I\u2019m from Alabama; I grew up with Chick-fil-A. This is way better than anything I\u2019ve ever tasted from Chick-fil-A. So, let\u2019s try the fries. Not really their specialty, maybe a little soggy. What the fries may lack in crispiness, you can make up for with the sauces. Got a serious sauce situation going on here. Since this is sort of a Caribbean-influenced chain, they have plantains: beautiful, golden plantains. These look amazing, so let\u2019s try it. So, plantains. An acquired taste that I maybe have not yet acquired, but they sure are pretty to look at. I\u2019ve got to get another fried chipotle chicken sandwich. I had to do it. Two more of these crispy chicken chipotle sliders. I\u2019m just getting greedy at this point. It has got to be inevitable that they will make that, like, an actual, big chicken sandwich that can compete with Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. If you\u2019re in Florida, you\u2019re lucky. The rest of the United States has no idea what they\u2019re missing. Out of five stars, I\u2019d give it four and a half. I\u2019m gonna have to get another one of these.\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
