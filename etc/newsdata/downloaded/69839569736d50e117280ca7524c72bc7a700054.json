REUTERS/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo\n\nPolitical leaders, who a few weeks ago enjoyed the loyal support of core followers despite worsening economic conditions, are now the target of many of those people\u2019s ire.\n\nThat show of irreverence toward senior figures who have long commanded respect has broken taboos, setting these demonstrations apart from previous waves of dissent.\n\nSaad al-Hariri stepped down as prime minister on Tuesday in the face of mass protests fueled by resentment against the ruling elite, whom people blame for the dire state of the economy.\n\nThe son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, Gebran Bassil, who is also foreign minister, has become a figure of ridicule among many on the streets of the capital Beirut.\n\nHezbollah, the heavily armed Shi\u2019ite group widely recognized as the most powerful force in the country, has not been spared. Chants against its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah would have been unthinkable last month. Now they are common.\n\nIn Nabatiyeh, a mainly Shi\u2019ite town in the south of the country, protesters have set their sights on Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, one of Lebanon\u2019s most powerful politicians whose Amal Movement dominates the area.\n\n\u201cI have come down to protest to bring down Berri who is a symbol of corruption,\u201d said Koussay Charara, a Shi\u2019ite teacher who was one of thousands of people occupying the town square and surrounding streets.\n\nWhen hundreds of protesters chanted against Berri in one of the town\u2019s main streets, residents say they were attacked by groups of baton-wielding mobs believed to be supporters of Amal and its ally Hezbollah.\n\nAt least eight people were hurt, some of whom were hospitalized.\n\nIn other places in Nabatiyeh and elsewhere in the south, posters of Berri that adorned government buildings were damaged by angry demonstrators.\n\nThe politician himself has sided with protesters, telling MPs from his party last week that the crowds had achieved some of the changes that Amal itself had been demanding for decades.\n\nA source within Amal said the tens of thousands of people taking to the streets had made legitimate demands for greater transparency, accountability and action against corruption.\n\n\u201cThe Amal movement and its leader were not surprised by the social explosion that took place,\u201d he said.\n\nThat explosion is pitting people once aligned in a single faction against each other, adding to the sense of chaos in Lebanese towns and cities.\n\nIn Nabatiyeh, those backing Berri chanted their support.\n\n\u201cWith our blood and lives we offer ourselves as a sacrifice for you Nabih,\u201d they shouted.\n\nNew posters appeared of the smiling politician, accompanied by the words \u201cWe are With You\u201d.\n\nNORTH AND SOUTH IN TURMOIL\n\nSome Amal and Hezbollah supporters wearing black clothes and carrying sticks and pipes attacked and destroyed the anti-government protest camp in Beirut, believing the protesters were tarnishing their leader Nasrallah.\n\nIt was the most serious strife in the capital since 2008, when Hezbollah fighters seized control in a brief eruption of armed conflict with Lebanese adversaries loyal to Hariri and his allies.\n\nAnalysts are taking particular note of dissent in the south of Lebanon, because of the political dominance long enjoyed there by Amal and Hezbollah.\n\n\u201cThere are more daring voices in the south. Demonstrations were breaking the previous taboos in politics,\u201d said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center.\n\nThe north has not been spared either.\n\nIn the mostly Sunni Muslim city of Tripoli, one of Lebanon\u2019s poorest, protesters turned on their leaders by burning tyres near a villa owned by former Sunni prime minister Najib Mikati.\n\n\u201cYou are one of them!\u201d they chanted, referring to the political elite they despise.\n\nAli Omar, a Sunni university teacher, said that a brief walk around Tripoli was more than enough proof that parliamentarians and Sunni leaders had done nothing for the city over the years.\n\n\u201cGo look in the city and see the unemployment rate, look at the electricity ... go to the social security offices, look at the roads with their potholes, at the oppression.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nTripoli has seen some of the biggest, liveliest demonstrations of the past two weeks. People have gathered daily in the city square, chanting and dancing deep into the night.\n\nOmar said people were sick of spending their lives asking for favors or begging officials for their basic rights.\n\n\u201cWhere are all these taxes going? Into their bank accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 30 years we\u2019ve been screaming ... that half the youth are unemployed. What do we have to do for you to hear us?\u201d", "description": "In the protests sweeping Lebanon, nothing is sacred.", "authors": ["Suleiman Al-Khalidi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446554614&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T18F", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
