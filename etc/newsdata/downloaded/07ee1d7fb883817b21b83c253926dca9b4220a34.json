Could the prime minister really defy the law on an extension to force his pig-in-lipstick deal through?\n\nThere had been plenty of good reasons not to travel from the country\u2019s four corners to march in the capital: the rugby, the money, the ennui. And above all there had been the danger that the timing might make it all futile anyhow. That \u2013 by the time marchers reached Parliament Square\u2013 the demand for a confirmatory referendum would have finally been thwarted, and the latest million man-woman-and-child march would turn into a wake or a vigil. But the marchers turned up anyway, and they were, under darkening skies, rewarded with yet another possible hint of light.\n\nThe prime minister had attempted to choreograph his \u201cSuper Saturday\u201d session of parliament in the tradition of previous crisis-sittings, those that had assembled for debate about war in 1939 and conflict in Suez in 1956 and the Falklands in 1982.\n\nThis time, in Johnson\u2019s telling, the battle lines were drawn between parliament and the people. By \u201cpeople\u201d Johnson meant that section of the population identified by Nigel Farage on the morning after the referendum vote when, in announcing his poundshop \u201cindependence day\u201d, he had talked of Brexit as a victory for \u201creal people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.\u201d\n\nAmong the most dangerous themes of that politics of division has been to tell some parts of the population that they are more grounded here in blood and in soil than others. The hundreds of thousands of very real people determined to march once more in London told a very different, more inclusive, island story. One that cuts across borders of politics and circumstance and region. And if ministers had wanted to see the will of those people in full force, they could have looked out of the windows of the Palace of Westminster.\n\nPlay Video 1:29 Tens of thousands march for second Brexit referendum in London \u2013 video\n\nThey would have seen people like Dave Blackburn, 62, a support worker for autistic adults, who had come down with a small group overnight on the bus from Glasgow. \u201cIt was getting down to the wire and I still thought there was a chance of a second vote,\u201d Blackburn told me before the march set off. \u201cMy friends are mostly for Scottish independence, and whatever happens I think that battle will now be won. But I think this, leaving the EU, will anyway be a disaster for working people.\u201d\n\nHis fellow sleepless traveller Sheila Connolly, who works with young homeless people, laughed at how their bus down had been advertised with reclining seats \u201cbut that only seemed to apply to seats in front of you\u201d. She had to be here because she would be devastated if Johnson\u2019s deal passed. \u201cI don\u2019t care what they say, this is another way for them to come for working people,\u201d she said.\n\nOr the politicians might have seen Emmanuelle Brook, a teaching assistant in her 40s with two children, among 500 people up from Cornwall. Brook, born in France, has lived in the UK for 24 years. \u201cWe came here on a set of rules we thought would last, and now I have been made a foreigner again,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters came from all demographics. Photograph: Tom Corban/Rex/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI get asked where I am from all the time.\u201d She had been scared about today, had the deal been ratified. \u201cNot just the economics but the human impact of Brexit. I may be safe here, but I no longer feel it.\u201d\n\nStrangely, as the debates unfolded and the march once again inched toward its destination, there appeared to be no mention of the presence of its massed ranks at the government dispatch box. Not for the first time in recent years it was as if the world inside the chamber bore no relation to that outside its doors, a Westminster bubble indeed. Among the marchers there was, oddly, a similar lack of curiosity about the progress of the debates happening up the road, a sense that everything that could have been said on the subject had long since been said, and that it was now a stubborn numbers game of ayes and noes.\n\nThe turnout of marchers, coaches and buses from all over, and their mostly irrepressible good humour, once again provided an alternative set of figures to contemplate. Despite the heckling of Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was with his young son, as they left the Commons, this may well be the most good-natured and well-mannered of protest movements the country has ever mustered, but no one should doubt its determination.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An effigy depicting Boris Johnson as a puppet operated by his adviser Dominic Cummings.

And, like Oliver Letwin, that four hours is not long enough to scrutinise the most significant piece of legislation in a generation.\n\nTalk to almost any one of that number and you would be hard pressed to make a case against the idea that, at heart, Brexit has become an assault on the salt of the earth. Judith Spencer, who spent her career as a psychologist on the civil servants\u2019 appointment board, is 79; she is walking with the \u201cIn Limbo\u201d group of EU citizens and UK citizens in Europe, the five million who still live with willed uncertainty. \u201cI was born here half-Japanese in 1940,\u201d Spencer tells me. \u201cAnd I encountered discrimination from the word go. To see mature professional Europeans who have made their lives here suffering discrimination in this country now really horrified me. Hearing that their kids are being terrorised in the playgrounds. I can feel the country moving backwards.\u201d\n\nBy now, among seasoned marchers, there are few new placards under the sun, but there seemed more saltires and Welsh dragons and county flags alongside EU flags and union jacks this time, as people asserted what should never have been in doubt: that all citizens enjoy layers of identity. In among these banners, there was the usual smattering of blunt regional aphorism. A party from Aberdeen had gone with the straightforward \u201cBoris is a Bawbag\u201d. Those from Stratford had chosen a quote from The Tempest \u201cbless our Europe\u201d Then there was \u201cBramm orth Brexit\u201d, which translated, I was reliably informed, with apologies to Monty Python, as \u201cI fart in Brexit\u2019s general direction\u201d.\n\nCassie Histed, a warehouse worker from Warwick, is amused and heartened by the good cheer of the march, the fact that it represents all ages and classes. Most of the marches she has joined in the past have had an angrier edge. She has always identified herself, she tells me, as part of the Sea-Green society which traces its history of protest back to the Levellers of the English civil war. She is on the Europhile wing of that group. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to be left adrift in the north Atlantic with Boris steering.\u201d\n\nThose famed \u201cardent\u201d Leave voters who favour that latter option might swallow the idea that these odd alliances of Remainers are a representation of some elite or other. They may snigger about the commitment of people who are angry at the railroading of our politics but who are not, by nature, angry people. They might, too, however, reflect on the fact that, in three-and-a-half years, the most notable collective showings of Brexit voters has been the 29 March \u201cBrexit Day\u201d gathering, dominated by the intelligentsia of the Football Lads\u2019 Alliance and their arthritic desire for a ruck in the name of Engerlund.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest EU supporters march as parliament sits.

One of them is that a hollowed-out Pringles tube makes a very effective loud hailer. He brought his two young sons along, he says, because \u201cwe are trying to teach them that democracy doesn\u2019t just happen or exist \u2013 \u201cyou have to keep trying to fight for it\u201d.\n\nThose drifting away from Parliament Square, and gathering for coaches and trains, carried that idea home with them.
