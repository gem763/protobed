First thing if you want to lose weight (Picture: Getty)\n\nExercising is about fun, mental health and overall well-being \u2013 never just weight loss.\n\nBut, if dropping a few pounds to get to a healthy weight is one of your goals, then you might want to start setting an early alarm.\n\nA new study by the University of Bath, has found that working out in the morning before having breakfast burns more fat than if you eat before you hit the gym.\n\nResearchers took a small sample of 30 obese or overweight men and they found that those who exercised before breakfast burned twice the fat as men who ate breakfast before they worked out.\n\nThe logic of it is pretty simple; exercising with no fuel forces the body to turn to carbs that are already stored in the body, and when those are gone, it turns to the fat cells.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, not eating breakfast made the men\u2019s muscles more responsive to insulin, which controls high blood sugars \u2013 so it also reduced the risk for diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\u2018The group who exercised before breakfast increased their ability to respond to insulin, which is all the more remarkable given that both exercise groups lost a similar amount of weight and both gained a similar amount of fitness,\u2019 said exercise physiologist Javier Gonzalez, an associate professor in the department for health at the University of Bath.\n\n\u2018The only difference was the timing of the food intake.\u2019\n\nSo if your looking to burn some fat, it might be worth trying to exercise on an empty stomach \u2013 but make sure you have a balanced breakfast waiting for you when you finish.\n\nYour body will need to take on carbs and protein in order to help your muscles recover. Eating a good meal after working out is vital for your long-term progress.\n\nIt\u2019s also really important to make sure you\u2019re well hydrated before exercising in the morning, and if you do choose to exercise without breakfast, opt for something a little more gentle.\n\nAnything too high-intensity could leave you feeling dizzy and unwell, which won\u2019t make for a great workout.\n\nMORE: Seven-year-old\u2019s glorious drawing of wedding cake leaves mum in hysterics\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Family adopt a \u2018micro pig\u2019, end up with 28-stone porker taking over their house\n\nMORE: Gay and bisexual South Asian men launch HIV test campaign to help diversify LGBTQ+ spaces\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A new study has found that exercising on an empty stomach can burn more fat than if you eat breakfast before.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1036911932_1571385055.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
