But the landlord just wasn\u2019t interested and said, 'It\u2019s in your tenant agreement'.\"\n\nBromford Housing Association said birds can \"cause a nuisance\" but Mr Buist rejects this notion.\n\n\"You see things on the internet now about birds, saying there\u2019s nothing for them to feed on and around here there\u2019s not a lot of common land for birds anywhere.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/EyeEm)\n\n\"So I thought, feeding them in the garden, they\u2019re not going to be disturbed by anything and there\u2019s water for them there,\" he continued.\n\n\"I put out fresh water for them and sometimes I put salt in the water for them so there\u2019s salt in their diet.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not like we\u2019re feeding them junk food - all they\u2019re eating is proper food.\n\n\"People [online] are saying it could cause rats. I said it\u2019s not going to cause rats because when you see the birds in there, it\u2019s like kiddies - they keep on eating and eating until the food is gone.\n\n\"So there\u2019s never any left for rats - none of our neighbours has ever complained about rats.\"\n\nBut Natalie Robertson, Bromford's head of locality, said: \"Following concerns that were raised to us we have spoken to Mr Buist to ask him to stop feeding wild pigeons in his garden, as they can cause a nuisance.\n\n\"But we are more than happy for customers to use bird tables and feeders to attract garden birds into their gardens.\n\n\"We have also not threatened to evict him and his family if they do not stop feeding the pigeons. We\u2019re committed to supporting customers with their tenancies and only view eviction as an absolute last resort.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the family to resolve both their and their neighbours\u2019 concerns going forward.\"", "description": "Craig Buist, from Patchway, Gloucestershire, has been putting out bird feed three times a day for the past four-and-a-half years", "authors": ["Andrew Mcquarrie", "Bradley Jolly", "Image", "James Beck", "Getty Images Eyeem"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20744390.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Craig-Buist.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
