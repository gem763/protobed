Not to keen on the idea, the Dingle legend makes a run for it \u2014 with her son Vinny (Bradley Johnson) in tow \u2014 but she\u2019s caught and brought back to the make-shift courtroom before long.\n\nIn spite of her resistance, Mandy finally reveals the truth to her family: that both she and Vinny were recently running a casino card counting scam in a number of establishments run by this Terry.\n\nDuring her explanation, viewers will learn that Charity was involved in the dodgy dealings as well!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs of yet, the the time in which this scam took place is not known, but Charity clearly has more knowledge than she\u2019s letting on.\n\nA shock twist, for sure!
