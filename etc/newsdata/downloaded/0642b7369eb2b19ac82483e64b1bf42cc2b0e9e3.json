Roast a whole celeriac for a great veggie main dish, or try a turnip & swede gratin for a decadent side dish.\"\n\nA Waitrose spokesperson added: : \"Many customers in recent years have probably avoided some of the more traditional root veg varieties as they were unsure of how to cook them. However more high end restaurants are making them real features on menus and top chefs are experimenting with ways to rev up the root.\n\nI think the wonky veg movement has made people less scared of picking up a less than pretty looking veg when they are shopping, and I think awareness is much higher now (lots of chefs using them in cook books etc.)\"", "description": "British root vegetables, once shunned for their shinier and more glamorous Mediterranean counterparts, are making a comeback as people get used to eating seasonally, Waitrose sales figures show.", "authors": ["Helena Horton", "Liz Truss", "Camilla Tominey", "Nick Timothy", "Iain Duncan Smith", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/18/TELEMMGLPICT000199866075-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZHrTyqqLjLkPKjc3TsrXSSooe0IxaCyVBdsVei4rh_Q.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
