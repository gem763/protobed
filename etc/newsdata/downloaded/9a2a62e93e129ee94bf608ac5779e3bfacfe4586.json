The FSCA was granted a high court to conduct the raid.\n\nIn a video published on Independent\u2019s Business Report website, Surv\u00e9 alleged that the raid was an attempt to get information his media house had on Gordhan and president Cyril Ramaphosa, which was supposed to be published this weekend. Independent Media owns The Star, Cape Times, The Mercury and Cape Argus.\n\nHe claimed that Gordhan was \u201cusing public resources to fight political battles\u201d.\n\nBut on Thursday evening, Gordhan\u2019s attorney Tebogo Malatji blasted Surv\u00e9\u2019s \u201cmalicious, yet nonsensical utterances\u201d and said his attacks on Gordhan were unsubstantiated, without basis in any evidence or facts.\n\n\u201cOur client has no oversight over the FSCA and could not possibly have directed its operations, including on whom the FSCA must conduct inspections.\n\n\u201cWhat the South African public knows is that Mr Surve and his business entities have been the subject of the Mpati Commission of Inquiry. The attempt at deflecting attention from this, by making false and defamatory allegations against Min. Gordhan and others, will not assist him and others in being held accountable for possible transgressions of the law.\"\n\nThe Mpati Commission investigated impropriety at the Public Investment Corporation. The commission heard that the PIC overpaid by billions to get a stake in tech firm AYO, which is linked to Sekunjalo. The PIC is currently in litigation to recover R4.3bn from AYO.\n\nIn his statement on Thursday evening, Malatji also invited Surv\u00e9 to produce proof of allegations he made about judges. According to Malatji, Surv\u00e9 alleged that one refused to grant the FSCA a warrant and that another judge who granted the warrant, did so because he has a relationship with Gordhan.\n\n\u201cDistraction and deflections have become a reflexive response by those who are under suspicion of one or other kind of misdemeanours.\u201d\n\nSurv\u00e9 also accused FSCA\u2019s acting head, Abel Sithole, of having a \"huge conflict of interest,\" due to his dual roles of caretaker head of the FSCA and principal officer of the Government Employees Pension Fund.\n\nThe GEPF, which manages the pension and other benefits of most government workers, is by far the largest constituent of the state-run asset manager PIC.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, FSCA denied this accusation.\n\nREAD: Financial regulator denies its head has conflict of interest in Iqbal Surv\u00e9 raid\n\n\u201cMr. Sithole was not involved in the search and seizure operation conducted by the FSCA on Wednesday, and there is no conflict of interest in this matter,\" it said in a statement.\n\nCompiled by Helena Wasserman", "description": "'Distraction and deflections have become a reflexive response by those who are under suspicion of one or other kind of misdemeanours.'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9148/8e113f46f7ab43198cfc33534d1867c0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
