People will die as they don't pay attention and are in world of their own.\n\nA commuter walks past the first Light Rail Vehicle in Circular Quay on July 30\n\n'Government officials will be kicking themselves over preventable accidents.'\n\nDrivers are reminded to not queue across the rail lines that pass through intersections and to follow the appropriate signage.\n\nSafety tips for drivers With the first leg of the Sydney light rail slated to open in December, drivers are reminded of a few road rules to follow to ensure their safety: 1) Do not drive along the tram tracks 2) Don't queue across the intersections 3) Follow traffic signals and don't turn in front of a tram 4) Don't stop or park on a tram lane Source: Sydney Light Rail\n\nThey should also never travel along the tracks in the middle of the road and to stick to the designated lanes on the outside of the tram line.\n\nNew footage shared online shows drivers almost choking up an intersection of the tram line in Sydney.\n\nThe truck was forced to reverse back into the side street to avoid being caught stopped across the tram line.\n\nCyclists have been warned to keep an eye out for new 'no entry' signs at frequently travelled routes.\n\nNew restrictions have been put in place at Hay Street, and ignoring the warnings could cost cyclists $114 in fines.\n\nCyclists are also forbidden from entering tramways and those caught doing so will face a $268 fine.\n\nPedestrians should note they will not be fined for jaywalking if they cross the street at a tramline - as long as they're more than 20 metres away from a set of lights.\n\nThey are also required to look up and stay vigilant as they cross.\n\nMotorists can also incur fines for not following new rules.\n\nThey will be fined $268 and single demerit point for entering and driving across a tramway.\n\nOne person suggested painting bright lines to indicate where motorists can no longer drive.\n\n'Maybe paint yellow lines on the edge of track like we have in Melbourne so cars know the distance between trams and roadway,' the man said.\n\nOne intersection in particular is confusing motorists already.\n\nNew footage shared online shows drivers almost choking up an intersection of the tram line in Sydney\n\nScores of people have taken to Facebook to say they have been unable to make turns at a number of busy road junctures on High Street, in Randwick, Sydney's east.\n\n'How do vehicles travelling east on High St enter UNSW near corner of Wansea Rd?' one driver commented.\n\nAnother one said: 'Is there a good reason for why you can no longer turn right from High Street to Avoca Street?\n\n'Right now you end up queueing behind vehicles turning left into Belmore road (waiting for pedestrians) but the right turn was always both safe and quick. I don't understand why this is now a no right turn.'\n\nThe NSW government recently released footage showing a number of near misses between trams and pedestrians during a test run of the tram line.\n\nIn one instance, a cyclist ignores the warning signs from a public transport worker to stop and crosses the tracks as a tram approaches only metres away.\n\nMore footage shows a car drive over the tracks, forcing an oncoming tram to stop to avoid a collision.\n\nThe first leg of the Sydney Light Rail is expected to open in December this year, though will only carry passengers between Randwick to Circular Quay.\n\nThe branch line to Kingsford along Anzac Parade is a long way from completion - early agency reports have hinted work could continue until March of 2020.", "description": "Pedestrians, motorists and cyclists will all be impacted by new road rules, which will be implemented by December when the Sydney light rail officially opens.", "authors": ["Brittany Chain", "Aidan Wondracz For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/03/19519444-0-image-a-20_1570675687084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
