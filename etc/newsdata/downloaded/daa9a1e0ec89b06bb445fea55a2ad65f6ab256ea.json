Can Uncle Sam keep spending without dire consequences?\n\nAccording to the newest estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the U.S. budget deficit hit $984 billion in fiscal year 2019. That amounts to a whopping 4.7% of U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the highest level since 2012.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not a shortage of money that\u2019s the problem. While the CBO reports that tax revenues were 4% higher in FY 2019 compared to FY 2018, federal outlays increased by 7%.\n\nYet for all sorts of reasons, bond investors haven\u2019t been worried. Fears about the global economy, coupled with the U.S.-China trade war, have sent yields to historic lows. At least for now, the status quo doesn\u2019t appear to be in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s likely going to continue,\u201d Edelman Financial Engines founder Ric Edelman told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned about the deficit than the debt, which might seem to be an inherent contradiction. It\u2019s the question of how much deeper you\u2019re digging the hole.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s \u201ctheory is that lowering taxes without lowering government spending will help to create growth,\u201d Edelman says. \u201cThe growth will result in more tax revenue which will pay for the costs of running the government.\u201d\n\n\u2018It could get ugly\u2019\n\nRevenue sources like corporate income taxes jumped by 12%, according to the CBO. But that extra revenue is quickly swallowed by spending on major mandatory programs\u2014such as Social Security and Medicare\u2014which saw their outlays climb by 6%. Interest payments on spiraling U.S. public debt leaped by 14% while costs for the military rose by 8%.\n\nThe fact that this spending binge and deficit pileup is happening during the longest economic expansion in modern U.S. history makes fiscal hawks like Edelman particularly uneasy.\n\nPortrait fragment of Benjamin Franklin close-up from one hundred dollar bill More\n\n\u201cImagine what happens if we in fact run into a recession,\u201d he warned. \u201cThat means we\u2019re going to face austerity. We\u2019re going to see a combination of tax increases and government cuts in spending.\u201d\n\nThe fact that a significant number of Americans have little in savings or liquid financial assets like stocks to fall back on gives Edelman even further cause for concern.\n\n\u201cIt could get ugly for a lot of parts of American society,\u201d according to Edelman. \u201cThe real question is: to what degree will this matter in the upcoming presidential campaign?\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Edelman Financial Engines founder Ric Edelman explains whether the U.S. has any chance of getting its exploding red ink under control.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7XXcmZYkfwM3f3ObKB4SaA--~B/aD0zMDM0O3c9NTc1NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/dd943790-ead6-11e9-bff7-a4f37dc6c48d", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
