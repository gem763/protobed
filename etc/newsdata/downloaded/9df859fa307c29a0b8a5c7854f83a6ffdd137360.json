The air is full of tension. Children are crying and the parents are helpless,\u201d she said, sounding visibly shaken.\n\n\u201cThe town is on high alert. People here are afraid of a possible genocide by the Turkish enemy. It is disastrous.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Shelling is now everywhere along the border,\u201d said one local journalist, who asked not to be named for fear of backlash.\n\n\u201cThey are worried about what the Syrian rebel fighters will do, particularly Kurdish citizens; they remember previous battles.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s rebel allies in northern Syria did little to assuage fears, saying on Wednesday they would show no mercy to Syrian Kurdish fighters in the northeast, whom they said had left them no choice but to battle.\n\n\u201cStrike them with an iron fist, make them taste the hell of your fires,\u201d the National Army, the main Turkey-backed rebel force, told its fighters.\n\nSeveral rights group told The Independent that last year they had documented multiple \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d committed by the Turkish military and its allied armed groups, and to a lesser extent Kurdish forces, in the towns of Afrin and Azaz in northern Aleppo, killing scores of civilians.\n\nAll feared a repeat with this incursion.\n\nThe UN and the aid agencies estimate that between 100,000 to 300,000 people could flee their homes if the fighting continues. Many of these people have already been displaced multiple times and are already living in terrible conditions.\n\n\u201cOne of our immediate concerns is the displacement crisis, all the camps are already massively underfunded,\u201d Sara Kayyali, a Syria researcher for Human Rights Watch, told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThere is unlikely to be the capacity to respond,\u201d she added.\n\nSonia Khush, Syria director for Save the Children, said aid agencies had not yet managed to put down infrastructure like water networks in the pre-existing camps, let alone new ones which may have to be set up.\n\nShe feared that the most vulnerable would be foreign children from 40 countries, including the UK, who came out of Isis-held territory last March and are now in specialised camps that may come under Turkish control if the offensive continues long enough.\n\nWe have nowhere to hide. We have no bunkers Sara, Kurdish resident of Tal Abyad\n\n\u201cThere are more than 9,000 children and we are asking their countries to repatriate them immediately, while they still can,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that we lose access to these children, we don\u2019t know if we can get aid to them or how they can be sent home safely.\u201d\n\nMs Kayyali said that the other concern was the track record of so-called safe zones in Syria, particularly since Turkey made it clear it would \u201crepatriate\u201d Syrian refugees in Turkey to the northern corridor.\n\n\u201cWhenever there is a safe zone, we see more violations inside of it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is impossible to guarantee the safety of these civilians, it is very concerning Turkey would actively force people into these areas.\u201d\n\nAngelita Caredda, of the Norwegian Refugee Council, urged an immediate halt in the fighting.\n\n\u201cWe must see the world\u2019s top powers commit to peaceful negotiations and seek an agreement, which protects civilians in the region,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe people of northeast Syria have already endured a humanitarian crisis \u2013 is the US or Turkey ready to push them into another one?\u201d she added.\n\nBack in Tal Abyad, Sara said that most of the 10,000 people who live in the city have fled.\n\n\u201cWe have nowhere to hide. We have no bunkers,\u201d she said as warplanes circled overhead.\n\n\u201cAnd me, I have nowhere else to go.\u201d", "description": "Terrified civilians, who stayed put in the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad, sent panicked messages saying they had \u201cnowhere to hide\u201d when the Turkish warplanes first snarled overhead.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/09/17/gettyimages-1173576965.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
