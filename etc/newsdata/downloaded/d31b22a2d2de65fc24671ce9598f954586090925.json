I know she would have been amazing as a midwife.\n\n\u2018I was so proud of her and I always will be. She was our star.\u2019\n\nShohfah El-Israel was convicted of her murder but never revealed where he hid her body (Picture: PA)\n\nIt is not yet confirmed how Joy died (Picture: South Beds News Agency)\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Justine Jenkins, said: \u2018My thoughts are with Joy\u2019s family at this difficult time and while nothing can end their pain, I hope that this gives them closure and I am glad that they will now have the opportunity to say goodbye to Joy.\u2019\n\nEl-Israel, whose birth name is Ajibola Shogbamimu, and Joy spent time alone together before he killed her.\n\nThe 40-year-old then tried to cover his tracks by removing her number from a church Telegram group chat to make it appear she had left the close-knit religious group.\n\nIsrael even kept up the pretence by going to her student house share under the guise of checking on her in the days after she apparently went missing.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
