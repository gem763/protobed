Williams has until Week 10 to accrue a season.\n\nSome great insight here. From what I hear, \u201csooner rather than later\u201d could even mean next week. A long nightmare of a summer for the #Redskins and their star LT could be coming to a close. https://t.co/lexjGkr8Ck \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) September 3, 2019\n\nHall said there is still \u201czero chance\u201d Williams reports for Washington\u2019s Week 1 game against the Philadelphia Eagles, but left open the door for a return after that.\n\n\u201cTrent\u2019s very smart,\u201d Hall said. \u201cHe understands the business of things. He would not, he would not let a year ago by without getting that season credited it for itself.\u201d\n\nHall said he has talked with both Williams and Bruce Allen throughout this holdout. On the NFL Network, Hall suggested Williams wanted to see changes to the team\u2019s medical staff, but appeared to back away from that claim on the podcast.\n\n\u201cBruce told me he asked Trent, \u2018Tell me who to fire and I\u2019ll fire them,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cTrent\u2019s response? \u2018Man, I don\u2019t want to cost anybody their job. I don\u2019t want to put anybody\u2019s livelihood in my hands.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliams is upset over the handling of a benign tumor on his scalp, which required surgery. Williams has asked for either a trade or a new contract \u2014 neither of which the Redskins are willing to do. The 31-year-old has reportedly told friends he vows to never play for Washington again.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
