Meanwhile, a second poll published by Business Insider found Mr Yang had the highest net support out of all the 2020 Democratic candidates among undecided general election voters who were considering voting for either party\u2019s nominee.\n\nLast week, Mr Yang, who has placed proving people a universal basic income at the centre of his campaign, said he would be happy to serve as vice president, if he failed to win the nomination.\n\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m not someone who\u2019s had some crazy, native desire to be president of the United States since I was a kid, because I\u2019m not insane,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m a parent. I\u2019m a patriot. I just want to help solve the problems of this era.\u201d\n\nEven though he has Asian ancestry, Mr Yang has run into controversy over some of his comments on race.\n\nAfter clips surfaced of comedian Shane Gillis using a racial slur in reference to Mr Yang, the Democrat was crtitised after offering to meet and commiserating about how society had become unforgiving of such remarks.\n\n\u201cMy question is \u2018what does Andrew yang bring to the ticket\u2019,\u201d Chrtistna Greer, professor of politics science at Fordham University, told The Independent. \u201cHe has a racial worldview that is troubling and out of date.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAnd if he does not have the support of black women, he is of no help.\u201d\n\nLarry Sabato, professor of politics at the University of Virginia, also raised a voice of caution.\n\n\u201cYou never know until the choice is announced, but it is highly improbable that Yang will be on the ticket,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe has no prior office experience, and almost certainly he would generate lots of controversy during the campaign with blunt statements of various kind. Rule number one in the selection of a running mate comes from Hippocrates: first, do no harm.\u201d", "description": "Democratic hopeful\u00a0Andrew Yang has thanked his supporters for making possible a new campaign advert in which he claims to be the first presidential candidate to talk openly about having a special needs child.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/29/12/yang-vice.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
