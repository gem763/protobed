(Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nAnnmarie Eovaldi used to hit Forever 21 just about every week. It was the perfect place, she said, to pick up an $18 romper or orange high heels \u2014 the fashion equivalent of a cheap thrill.\n\nBut a couple of years ago, around the time she turned 21, Eovaldi says she started to consider the environmental implications of cycling through low-quality pieces in the name of fashion.\n\n\u201cWhen I bought something, it would only last two or three wears before the color faded or the seams fell apart or the zipper broke,\u201d said Eovaldi, a college student in Rochester, Mich. \u201cThat\u2019s the trade-off you make when you shop at Forever 21: cheap prices but a huge amount of waste.\u201d\n\nNow she shops elsewhere, dropping away from the fast-fashion frenzy that has dominated much of retail for the past 20 years and given rise to such teen and young adult favorites as Forever 21, H&M and Zara.\n\nBut when Forever 21 filed for bankruptcy this week and announced it would close 350 stores worldwide, it became latest retail casualty of changing consumer habits. There were a number of reasons for its decline \u2014 including an overreliance on mall stores and its failure to invest online \u2014 but analysts say its troubles also signal a shift in consumers\u2019 thinking about what essentially is disposable clothing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching a tipping point in fast fashion,\u201d said Alexandra Sargent Capps, who teaches a course on fashion sustainability at Vanderbilt University. \u201cForever 21 was one of the original sinners of fast fashion \u2014 it helped invent the model and pushed it onto young people. Now its bankruptcy is part of a bigger movement to turn that around.\u201d\n\n[Forever 21 files for bankruptcy, will close 350 stores worldwide amid restructuring]\n\nThe environmental effects of fast fashion are well-documented: The apparel industry is a major source of water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. In 2015, Americans threw out nearly 12 million tons of clothing and shoes, three times as much as they did in 1990, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The vast majority of those items \u2014 69 percent \u2014 ended up in landfills.\n\nThere is also a human toll: Such retailers tend to rely on low-wage workers in countries like China and Bangladesh, where they have few protections.\n\nToday\u2019s consumers are looking for ways to reduce the cycle of waste, Capps said. As a result they are more open to buying used and vintage clothing, fueling the growth of resale sites like ThredUp, Poshmark and the RealReal. A number of major chains, including American Eagle Outfitters and Ann Taylor, have introduced rental plans that allow shoppers to borrow what they need for a flat monthly rate. And newer retailers like Reformation, Allbirds, Everlane and Rothy\u2019s have built their brands around promises of transparent sourcing and responsible labor practices.\n\n\u201cYoung people are becoming much more environmentally conscious,\u201d said Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a New York-based market research firm. \u201cThey\u2019ve shifted their mentality and are saying, \u2018We don\u2019t have to be gluttonous about fashion anymore.\u2019 \"\n\nSome fast-fashion chains also are responding to consumer demand. Zara\u2019s parent company, Inditex, projects it will complete its transition to using only organic, sustainable or recycled cotton, linen and polyester by 2025. London-based Asos, which posted a 87 percent drop in profits in the first half of its fiscal year, has said it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. Meanwhile H&M, which is closing 160 stores this year amid stalling sales and slipping profits, is doubling down on its Conscious line, which includes organic and sustainable options. It also offers discounts for shoppers who bring in clothing to recycle.\n\nEven so, industry insiders say the movement is still in its early stages.\n\n\u201cThe word might be out that there\u2019s something wrong with fast fashion, but the alternatives are not that robust,\u201d said Elizabeth Cline, author of \u201cOverdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion.\u201d\n\nIn her new book, \u201cConscious Closet,\u201d Cline offers a number of ways shoppers can make more environmentally friendly decisions, including getting more use out of the items they already own, shopping secondhand and mending items instead of throwing them away.\n\n\u201cSustainable fashion does not mean going out and buying a $200 organic cotton dress,\u201d she said. \u201cThe most important thing is to shift your purchases away from big companies that are doing absolutely nothing to be sustainable, and I would include Forever 21 in that category.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Forever 21 said the company \u201ccontinues to explore different sustainability and social responsibility initiatives.\" A new recycling program in its Los Angeles stores, for example, allows shoppers to drop off used clothing and shoes in exchange for a discount. She added that the company transports merchandise by sea instead of air to lower carbon emissions, and that it conserves energy by using solar panels at its headquarters and energy-efficient lighting at its newest stores.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly listening to our customers and working to evolve to meet their needs and expectations,\" Alecia Pulman said in an email.\n\nFor decades, Forever 21 \u2014 known for churning out of-the-moment items at rock-bottom prices \u2014 was a fast-fashion pioneer, giving Americans the kind of instant gratification traditional department stores could not. It made billions selling $4 leggings and $16 dresses to teenagers and 20-somethings.\n\nBut as those shoppers grew up, analysts say, Forever 21 didn\u2019t. Sales fell to $3.3 billion last year, a 25 percent decline from $4.4 billion two years earlier.\n\n\u201cTheir customers are getting older, they\u2019re aging out of disposable fashion and they want things that last,\u201d said Shawn Grain Carter, a professor of fashion business management at the Fashion Institute of Technology. \u201cGen Z and Millennials take social responsibility very seriously.\u201d\n\n[Looking for a socially conscious holiday gift? You may have to decide between principles and price.]\n\nBut, she added, that doesn\u2019t mean demand for low-priced, trendy clothing has disappeared. Online retailers like Fashion Nova, Missguided and Lulus have won over market share in recent years by appealing to young shoppers directly on Instagram. And Target, she said, has carved out its own nice selling \u201ccheap and cheerful\u201d clothing to the masses.\n\nEovaldi, the Michigan college student, said she now shops at Loft, Target and Old Navy, where garments have a longer life span. She also browses secondhand stores.\n\n\u201cI try my best to find affordable clothes that last,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t always easy.\u201d\n\nAt Vanderbilt, Capps says her students are \u201crethinking what they buy and why they\u2019re buying it,\u201d though they are often \u201cshocked by price tags for sustainable fashion.\u201d\n\nLow prices are what keep Sana Abdu returning to Forever 21. The 33-year-old said she stops in every few weeks for a pair of $20 skinny jeans. Each one, she said, lasts about six months.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not that great in quality, but in terms of price \u2014 well, that\u2019s why I shop here,\u201d she said, clutching the chain\u2019s bright yellow shopping bag on a recent weekday morning. She was leaving the company\u2019s sprawling store in downtown Washington, one of nearly 180 U.S. locations on the chopping block.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frugal,\u201d said Abdu, a recruiter for the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThe cheaper, the better.\u201d\n\nDiscover something new:\n\nWe\u2019ve curated these stories to inspire your curiosity.\n\nGet smart about how the modern space race affects cities\n\nIn the 1960s, this Florida coast line was a boomtown thriving on the race to the moon.
