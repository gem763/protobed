Elton John's double side \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\" and \"Candle in the Wind\" went diamond in 1997.\n\nNas is also the first openly gay man to win the MTV Video Music Award for Song of the Year.\n\nThe 20-year-old also has another shot at making music history at this year's Grammy awards. With \"Old Town Road\" a rumored front-runner for Record of the Year, Nas could become the first gay black artist to win that award.\n\n\"Old Town Road\" spent a historic 19-weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 -- the longest in chart history.", "description": "Lil Nas X's", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/lil-nas-x-gty-jt-191024_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
