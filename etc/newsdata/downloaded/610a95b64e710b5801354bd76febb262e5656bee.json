The company\u2019s billionaire founder, Richard Branson, was on hand at the New York Stock Exchange Monday morning to celebrate the public offering, along with firework shows and a giant banner of his eye adorning the outside of the building.\n\nFor its first day of trading, the company\u2019s stock \u2014 under the ticker SPCE \u2014 was on the rise for a good part of the morning. Shares opened at $12.34, but ultimately closed at $11.75 \u2014 a .3 percent decrease.\n\nInvestors will decide if they want to put their money into a company focused on sending tourists to space\n\nThe question now is if public investors will put their money into a company focused on sending tourists to space, where they\u2019ll experience a few minutes of weightlessness. Virgin Galactic\u2019s premiere vehicle is a spaceplane called VSS Unity, which carries a handful of passengers to the edge of space and then lands on a runway. So far, Virgin Galactic has sent VSS Unity to space only twice, with a total of five passengers on board. The plan is for commercial operations to begin sometime in mid-2020, when Branson himself will take to space for the first time.\n\nBranson and Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides spoke with The Verge about today\u2019s public offering and how it will help the company in the months ahead.\n\nThis interview was lightly edited for clarity.\n\nThe Verge: I\u2019d love to know how the first day of trading is going in your opinion.\n\nRichard Branson: I\u2019m looking at the chart as you speak and the bigger arrow going straight out. I think we\u2019ve had two really good days. So the 11 percent rise on Friday, and then 5 or 6 percent today. Anyway, looking good.\n\nHow hopeful is this listing going to be for you, since you\u2019re still in development and trying to get to those first commercial launches going mid-next year?\n\nBranson: Virgin Galactic raised half a billion dollars ... We were going to do a deal with the Saudis which we turned down a few months ago, because of the Khashoggi incident. Having that money in the company, it replaces the Saudi money, and it will be very helpful in getting more people, getting more spaceships on the way to be developed, getting another mothership built and finishing up the job.\n\nWe will be putting people, including myself, into space next year. And once we start putting people in space we\u2019re going to need to try to speed up the process of getting as many spaceships as we can get our hands on.\n\nYou\u2019ve just had a big milestone with the second spaceship [powering it up for the first time]. Can you explain how development is going with that one?\n\nGeorge Whitesides: Yeah, obviously you know that\u2019s a huge milestone, for any vehicle, is the day that you can really turn on the avionics, turn on the electrical, and it\u2019s all being driven internally from onboard batteries. That\u2019s a big deal. We still have a good ways to go on that vehicle, but you know, I think what\u2019s encouraging is it\u2019s starting to look like a spaceship structurally.\n\nEarlier you discussed your financials and how right now revenue is slow, because you\u2019re not selling tickets. How crucial are those additional spaceplanes and when do you expect to open up tickets again and to see more revenue coming in?\n\nWhitesides: The additional spaceships are really important for the business. We need to bring additional capacity into the market, and we think that we\u2019re going to be able to sell those seats. We\u2019ll have one vehicle \u2014 [VSS] Unity \u2014 operating, and then we\u2019ll bring another one in relatively soon after that. And we\u2019ll just keep adding them in sort of almost like once a year; that\u2019s the sort of general plan.\n\n\u201cThe additional spaceships are really important for the business.\u201d\n\nYou know, we have some 600 customers who have paid up, but since the December flight, when we opened up the ability for people to register their interest in buying, we\u2019ve had over 3,700 people make that reservation. So that\u2019s tremendously encouraging to us. These are people who are ostensibly aware of the ticket price. We\u2019re pretty encouraged by where we are right now.\n\nExplain to me again the plans for ticket prices. As I understand it, there\u2019s going to be a short increase in price, followed by a decrease. Can you explain how that\u2019s supposed to work?\n\nWhitesides: Yeah, it\u2019ll go up for a bit, and honestly, we\u2019re going to have a dynamic pricing scheme. We think that we... frankly, we sort of underpriced it probably for a while. But that\u2019s okay; that\u2019s to the credit of the good folks who signed up early. Those are sort of the early adopters. We\u2019ll raise the price to reflect the development costs and other costs associated with it. But over time, our whole business is to reduce costs, and it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what the time frame will be. It\u2019ll be essentially market driven, but that is the long-term goal.\n\nWhat\u2019s the main way that you envision reducing that cost? What will it take?\n\nWhitesides: It\u2019s a couple of different things. One of them is just sort of normal aerospace manufacturing efficiencies \u2014 both on the spaceships as a whole, as we build additional spaceships, our per-unit cost will go down. And then also with marginal equipment-based things like our rocket motor cartridge \u2014 we\u2019re already integrating innovations that enable us to build them cheaper, but still maintain quality.\n\nRichard Branson celebrates the first day of trading for the world\u2019s first and only publicly listed human spaceflight company.

We think on the order of maybe 10 to 15 percent. And so you can see if that\u2019s true, then adding a couple of spaceships in, your per-flight labor economics are actually getting much better.\n\nYou have had a recent string of milestones. Today\u2019s filing comes just two weeks after the unveiling of your flight suits. What\u2019s next, and when can we expect the next flight to space?\n\nWhitesides: We\u2019ll have a lot more fun things to come. I don\u2019t want to give away what they are, but we still have the unveil of the spaceship interior, and a few other really fun things that you\u2019ll see coming down the road. We need to finish the move down to Spaceport America before we begin the last phase of our test flight program. And then, if all goes well, we\u2019ll be in a position to fly that historic first flight for Richard.\n\n\u201cIf all goes well, we\u2019ll be in a position to fly that historic first flight for Richard.\u201d\n\nBranson: And whoever comes up with me, which we will be announcing sometime quite soon!\n\nCan you say how many people will be coming up with you?\n\nBranson: No, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re saving this one up, but thanks for asking.\n\nWhat was it like to see the company start trading under the SPCE symbol today?\n\nBranson: It\u2019s taken 15 years to get here and an enormous effort by just under 1,000 engineers, and lots of ups and downs. It was just great. And also we were very lucky to have the SPCE symbol. I\u2019m not really allowed to say, but it was the generosity of another exchange that gave us this. And we were extremely grateful that they let us have it. It just couldn\u2019t be better to have the ticker SPCE as our symbol.\n\nYou mentioned ups and downs, and it has been a long road to get here. I\u2019m curious, what do you have to say for anyone who might be a little wary of investing in the first publicly traded human spaceflight company?\n\nBranson: It doesn\u2019t seem to have been an issue. I mean, we\u2019ve got a tremendous group of institutions who have come in \u2014 some of the biggest institutional names. And the public seems to be coming in in quite large numbers. It\u2019s an exciting company, but it\u2019s also a company that has all the potential of making fantastic returns. And we\u2019ll do our best to honor all the investors that have come into it.", "description": "Space tourism venture Virgin Galactic is now a publicly traded company, thanks to a reverse merger.
