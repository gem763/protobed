The may have dropped to its lowest level in 50 years but the labor market is weakening and not improving. While the data suggests that the economy is at full employment, hence the moderation in job growth, the slowdown in the and poses a major risk to hiring in the months ahead. Only 136K jobs were created last month but the big problem is wages. On a monthly basis, wage growth stagnated and year-over-year, fell to a 12-month low. The expansion is slowing and as a result, the is falling. The only reason why we didn\u2019t see a steeper decline is because it was a weak but not terrible report. The job market is still the strongest in decades, but there\u2019s no question that it is in the midst of a slowdown.\n\nThe odds of a rate cut fell according to , which are now pricing in a 73% chance of easing this month and 90% chance by December. On Thursday, traders saw an 85% chance of an October rate cut. We felt these odds were aggressive given the Fed\u2019s outlook last month and we still feel the same way after the speech from Chairman Powell on Friday. He reiterated that the economy faces risks but also believes it's in a good place overall. We don\u2019t think US policymakers share the market\u2019s eagerness for easing and data over the next month will dictate whether the market or the Fed changes their views. The from their last FOMC meeting will be released next week along with inflation numbers. The minutes should help the but inflationary pressures remain low. Investors should keep an eye on trade headlines as well because on Friday, President Trump said he sees \u201ca very good chance of a trade deal with China.\u201d Technically, is headed for 106 but positive trade headlines could shift the pair\u2019s outlook easily.\n\nNext week will also be an important one for . October 11 is the deadline for the UK to deliver an acceptable exit proposal. Unfortunately it seems that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is moving further away from crafting an agreement with changes substantial enough for the EU to reopen negotiations. On Friday, Johnson sent over his final proposals, which included mild and not major concessions. Sterling traded in a tight range throughout the week against the US dollar and now hangs in the balance. Many believe the proposals will be rejected by the EU, which could send the currency tumbling lower. Data last week was mixed with the index rising but the and index falling. However activity in all 3 sectors are contracting, which underscores the weakness in the UK economy.\n\ntraded higher against the US dollar four out of the last five trading days. A large part of the move had to do with weaker US data, the sell-off in the and expectations for Fed easing. However the single currency had also become deeply oversold and a light EZ calendar meant that it was due for a recovery. With that said, the outlook for the region is dim, especially after the US imposed fresh tariffs on the EU this week. Duties on Italian cheese, French wine, Spanish olives and British biscuits will increase to 25%. Retaliatory tariffs are expected and when they are announced will most likely drive the euro lower. Next week\u2019s economic reports include Germany\u2019s , and reports.\n\nThe and dollars also traded higher against the greenback this week but the hit a 1-month low. Although the Reserve Bank lowered interest rates for the third time this year, A$ benefitted from weakness, stronger and PMI and positive trade headlines. NZ$ followed A$ higher as there were no major New Zealand economic reports on the calendar. The loonie on the other hand failed to participate in the rally because of the extent of data weakness. Not only did growth slow in July, but the index dropped 11.9 points to its lowest level in nearly 3 years. The report showed manufacturing activity contracting for the first time since May 2016 due to significant declines in employment, inventories and supplier deliveries. This report will surely spark talk of a rate cut from the Bank of Canada making next week\u2019s exceptionally important.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Kathy Lien covering: EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD.
