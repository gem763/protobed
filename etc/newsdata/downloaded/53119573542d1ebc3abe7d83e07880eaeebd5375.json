Both are known for brash styles, contempt for the news media and a predilection for 280-character missives to huge followings on Twitter.\n\nThe two leaders shared the stage Sunday at \u201cHowdy, Modi\u201d a rally in Houston before tens of thousands of Indian-Americans. The event, which comes ahead of Modi's trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, marked the prime minister's largest crowd since his rock concert-like rally at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 2014.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walk around NRG Stadium waving to the crowd during the \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Houston.

The taglines are emblazoned on placards at raucous rallies they hold on the campaign trail.\n\nIndia Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump walk hand in hand as they exit the stage at the Community Summit on September 22, 2019 at NRG Stadium Houston, Texas.

Many spectators in the crowd of wore white T-shirts that proclaimed: \"Howdy, Modi.\"\n\nModi introduced Trump as \"my friend, a friend of India\" and as someone who \"has left a deep and lasting impact everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrump returned the compliment during his remarks, lavishing praise on Modi and calling him \"a great man and a great leader.\" Relations between the two countries are stronger than ever before, Trump said, citing U.S. energy exports to India, plans for space cooperation and joint military exercises, and the first-ever NBA game to be played in India in October.\n\n\"Am I invited, Mr. Prime Minister?\" Trump said of the basketball game in Mumbai. \"Be careful,\" he teased. \"I may come.\u201d\n\nA man wearing an India Prime Minister Narendra Modi mask waits for Prime Minister Modi to speak at the Community Summit on Sept. 22, 2019 at NRG Stadium Houston, Texas.

SHEA, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Houston event was the third time Trump and Modi have met in as many months, after they were seen clasping hands at the G-20 in Japan in June and at the G-7 in France in August.\n\n\u201cHowdy, Modi\u201d is seen as a diplomatic win for Modi, whose controversial move last month to strip the Muslim-majority Kashmir of its partial autonomy sparked international scrutiny and angered Pakistan, which also claims the region. The State Department has also expressed concern over India\u2019s crackdown on Kashmir, which included detaining hundreds of people and shuttering internet and mobile service.\n\nModi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been criticized for its hardline Hindu-nationalist agenda, pursuing policies perceived as anti-Muslim and fraying the secular fabric of India. Critics plan to protest the prime minister's actions and alleged human rights abuses outside the rally in Houston.\n\nMaking amends with the Aussies:Trump hosts state dinner for PM Morrison\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi shake hands during a bilateral meeting at the G-7 summit in Biarritz, France, Monday. (Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nMuch like Trump, Modi has made national security a primary focus, referring to himself as the nation\u2019s \u201cchowdikar,\u201d or watchman, in the wake of a showdown with Pakistan in Kashmir in February. He casts himself as a protector, defending India\u2019s borders from terrorists and enemies while his American counterpart employs similar rhetoric, railing against criminals and migrants \"pouring into our country\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMilan Vaishnav, the head of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Modi\u2019s appearance with Trump is diplomatic validation of his recent policies, signaling to Pakistan that the U.S. stands with India. It could also send a message to China amid an escalating trade war with the U.S.\n\n\"The U.S. president and Indian prime minister sharing a stage and showing a lot of camaraderie and friendship is likely to make some people very nervous in Beijing,\" Vaishnav said.\n\nThe United States, he said, is explicit about investing in India as a way to balance China in the region.\n\n\"I think this is an additional way to kind of muscle terms in the U.S.-China relationship,\" Vaishnav said.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embrace while delivering joint statements in the Rose Garden of the White House June 26, 2017 in Washington, DC.

Trump hinted to reporters on Wednesday aboard Air Force One that there \u201ccould be\u201d a trade-related announcement after the event. \u201cI have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump on whistleblower complaint:Trump said 'doesn't matter' if he asked Ukraine to investigate Biden\n\nBut the spectacle also is designed to put the president, who is ramping up his own re-election campaign, before an expected audience of 50,000 Indian-Americans, the second largest immigrant group in the U.S. after Mexicans.\n\nThe special gesture of President @realDonaldTrump to join us in Houston highlights the strength of the relationship and recognition of the contribution of the Indian community to American society and economy. #HowdyModi \u2014 Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 16, 2019\n\nThe Indian-American population in the U.S., about 4 million, increased by 40% between 2010 and 2017, making them the fastest-growing immigrant group in the country, according to a recent report by South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), a South Asian advocacy group.\n\n\u201cModi has really energized the Indian-American community and that community, which constitutes about 1% of the overall U.S. population now, is a pretty important one in a lot of political constituencies because we know that they\u2019re upwardly mobile, highly educated, they\u2019re above the median household income and so they actually have some political weight,\u201d Vaishnav says.\n\n\u201cI think Modi is sort of signaling in a way that in this big constituency he actually has some influence over them. And these are people who actually turn out in U.S. elections,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi walk around NRG Stadium waving to the crowd during the \"Howdy Modi: Shared Dreams, Bright Futures\" event, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2019, in Houston. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nModi, whose 71% approval rating far surpasses Trump\u2019s 44%, has cultivated a massive following among the Indian diaspora. Indian Americans are one of the most politically engaged immigrant groups in the U.S., with 62% casting their vote in 2016, just above the overall U.S. turnout rate of 61.4% and surpassing the rates for both Hispanics and African-Americans.\n\nElizabeth Warren on the rise: As the 2020 Democrat gains in the polls, criticism from her rivals is growing\n\nBut whether Modi's global appeal can extend to his American counterpart is less clear. About 66% of Indians disapproved of the president's job performance while only 28% agreed he was doing well, according to Asian American and Pacific Islander Data (AAPI Data), a survey of Asian-American attitudes from the University of California.\n\nThe Houston event shines a light on a glaring contradiction in the Indian-American community. Indians in the U.S. skew strongly Democratic, with 77% of Indian-Americans voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016. But they also overwhelmingly support Modi, a man who echoes Trump\u2019s populist brand of personality politics.\n\nSupporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), wearing masks of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, listen to Modi during a public rally in Shillong on December 16, 2017.

(Photo: Jason DeCrow, AP)\n\nIn Houston, Trump also made a direct appeal to Indian Americans, citing what he called their groundbreaking achievements in medicine and business.\n\n\"You enrich our culture, you uphold our values \u2026 and we are proud to have you as Americans,\" he said.\n\nAfter the Houston event, Modi was to receive an award from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for his campaign to install public toilets in rural parts of India. The move has prompted protests over Modi's human rights record and provocations in Kashmir.\n\nExplaining the Trump, Biden, Ukraine story: Why Trump and Congress are in a standoff over an intelligence agency whistleblower complaint\n\nJugal Malani, chairman of the Texas India Forum, which organized the event, said the rally looked beyond politics to instead focus on India's ascent on the world stage.\n\n\"The prime minister is a very popular figure in our community,\" he says. \"He's taking care of people below the poverty line and I think that has attracted a lot of people. He's changing India from the grassroots level.\"\n\nTrump's appearance with Modi could also attract more Indian donors in 2020, according to MR Rangaswami, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley and founder of Indiaspora, a nonprofit that works to increase Indian-American civic participation. With an average household income of $107,000 \u2013 nearly double that of American-born households \u2013 Indian-Americans have become a sought-after donor pool. Rangaswami points out several 2020 candidates have appealed to Indian-Americans.\n\nAn India fan holds up over-sized portraits of US President Donald Trump and Indian PM, Narendra Modi in the crowd during the 2019 Cricket World Cup first semi-final between India and New Zealand at Old Trafford in Manchester, northwest England, on July 9, 2019.

Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, is not Indian but identifies as Hindu and maintains close relations with the BJP government. Sen. Corey Booker, D-New Jersey, recruited several Indian-American staffers for his 2020 campaign, including his national press secretary and Iowa political director. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont named former Rep. Ro Khanna, who is of Indian descent, as one of his top advisers.\n\n\"The community is writing checks and I'm sure that hasn't gone unnoticed by the president,\" Rangaswami says. \"But the activism should also be noticed. In almost every 2020 campaign you can see there's an Indian-American involved there. And that's just one more milestone for our community.\"\n\nContributing: Michael Collins\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/22/trump-bromance-narendra-modi-howdy-modi-rally/2354099001/", "description": "Donald Trump will share the stage with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at \"Howdy, Modi\" rally in Houston.
