It may be time for a correction as the prospect of a U.K. election should hurt sterling sentiment.\n\nHeadline risk has now turned negative for the pound as price action Thursday showed. Sterling slipped to the lowest in a week versus the greenback amid news Johnson will ask Parliament to approve an early general election on Dec. 12. While polls suggest that a Tory-led government is the most probable outcome, traders may seek to hedge market-adverse scenarios and either trim long pound exposure or go short on sterling.\n\nTo make things worse for pound bulls, uncertainty prevails on the type of Brexit extension the European Union is willing to offer. EU diplomats want to know whether an election will actually take place before reaching a decision on the length of an extension, while the U.K. opposition party Labour says backing an election depends on the EU decision.\n\nTechnically, the euro is set to form a candle pattern on the weekly chart that suggests a short-term bottom is in place. The last time a so-called bullish harami was formed, the euro rose by 1% the following week. Volatility options reflect this upside risk for the currency pair, as bets benefiting from a stronger euro are trading at a premium.\n\nWhat to Watch:\n\nFOMC rate decision and Fed Chair Jay Powell news conference on Wednesday, Oct. 30; market has almost fully priced in a 25 basis points rate cutBank of Canada is expected to keep rates steady the same day; Governor Stephen Poloz gives press conference Bank of Japan rate decision and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda news conference on Oct. 31Policy maker speeches coming up include Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and policy maker Silvana Tenreyro; ECB Governing Council member Olli Rehn and Executive Board member Sabine Lautenschlaeger; Swiss National Bank President Thomas JordanEconomic releases include euro-area growth and inflation; U.S. payrolls, personal spending; Sweden and Norway manufacturing PMI; see data calendarNOTE: Vassilis Karamanis is an FX and rates strategist who writes for Bloomberg.
