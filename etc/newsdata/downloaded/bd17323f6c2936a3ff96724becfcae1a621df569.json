Lord Sugar decided to mix up the genders into two new groups, Empower and Unison.\n\nTeam leader of Empower Pamela split her team in half and refused to put a male contestant in charge of the sub-team and insisted it was a \"female\".\n\nShe said: \"I need a girl to be in charge of you all.\"\n\nLewis complained and believed his marketing expertise could really help his team. He said: \"It's not about gender, it's about skill set.\"\n\nHe then told the camera: \"She didn't pick me because of what was between my legs.\"\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe Apprentice viewers instantly took to Twitter to slam Pamela for her outwardly sexist remarks.\n\nOne user wrote: \"Imagine if that was the other way round.
