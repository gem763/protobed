Other updates to the software support the regulatory capital treatment of securitization exposures, the leverage ratio disclosure requirements, the large exposures framework, and the output capital floor under the final Basel framework.\n\nUsing the RiskAuthority solution, banks can confidently assess the capital ratio on their risk-weighted assets, and the regulatory capital they will be required to hold under the new rules.
