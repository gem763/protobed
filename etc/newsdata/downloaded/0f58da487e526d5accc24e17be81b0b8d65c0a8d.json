That will then enable them to own a share of the bank,\u201d said Gore.\n\nThe exact details are still being being worked out. Those include what financial behaviour by customers will be rewarded with more shares (or penalised with fewer shares) in line with Discovery Bank's \"behavioural banking\" approach.\n\nThe shares will be entirely vendor-financed, with no payments required from customers, Gore said \u2013 and so zero risk for those customers.\n\nBanks are not launched in South Africa every day, Gore said, stressing that Discovery Bank hopes to build value over time.\n\nHe admitted that there could be political risks in such an approach that specifically excludes white customers, but reiterated that, though the plans are at an early stage, Discovery thinks it is \"a very good thing to do\".\n\nThe bank is due to go through internal testing by staff over the holiday period, and is expected to be open to the public in March 2019.\n\nReceive a single WhatsApp every morning with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "Discovery plans to give 10% of its new bank to black depositors in an entirely vendor-financed system \u2013 though it recognises that could mean political trouble.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8191/22a36620dd9d421d898f45eac7a8da62.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-14"}
