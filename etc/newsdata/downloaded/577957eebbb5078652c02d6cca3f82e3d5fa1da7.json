The Node is growing and creating jobs while strengthening Canberra's knowledge economy -- particularly around cybersecurity in the space, defence, and education sectors,\" Canberra Cyber Security Innovation Node manager Linda Cavanagh said.\n\n\n\nAccording to AustCyber, the Canberra Node has already been working with companies such as Archtis, Cogito Group, Penten, and Quintessence Labs.\n\nSee also: How to become a cybersecurity pro: A cheat sheet (Tech Republic)\n\nThe Canberra Node will also be heading up the National Missing Persons Hackathon in October, as part of Australian Cyber Week 2019, which will see ethical hackers and investigators find leads on real missing persons cases in Australia.\n\n\n\nThe launch of the Canberra Node follows on from the opening of the NSW Cyber Security Innovation Node in July.
