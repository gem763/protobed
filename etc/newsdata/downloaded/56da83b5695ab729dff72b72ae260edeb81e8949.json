That such terms should be applied to a populist studio picture from the director of the Hangover movies is perhaps unsurprising. Phillips has previously struck gold by appealing to his audience\u2019s basest urges with the kind of nastily nihilistic gross-out comedies that he recently complained have been killed by \u201cwoke culture\u201d. Joker, which seems to draw in equal measure on Martin Scorsese\u2019s scabrous media satire The King of Comedy and Alan Moore and Brian Bolland\u2019s graphic novel Batman: The Killing Joke, has a similarly dyspeptic worldview, full of characters drunk on a destructive cocktail of enraged self-pity and self-gratification, the latter indulged with an obliterating disregard for consequences. The difference is, this time no one\u2019s laughing.\n\nLike Heath Ledger\u2019s Oscar-winning turn in The Dark Knight, Joker has an ace card in the form of Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s mesmerisingly physical portrayal of a man who would be king. Reduced to a skeletal state (think Christian Bale in The Machinist, but worse) by a diet of nicotine and pain, Phoenix\u2019s Arthur Fleck is a tragicomic nightmare, a beleaguered, sign-twirling clown who suffers from a medical condition that turns his internal screams into cackling laughter. Bullied, abused and increasingly enraged, Arthur lives with his mother, Penny (Frances Conroy), in Gotham, a city befouled by garbage strikes and overrun by mutant rats. He dreams of becoming a standup comic but has no idea what other people find \u201cfunny\u201d \u2013 a lethal combination.\n\nAs Gotham rots, Arthur seethes, licking his wounds while pasting pornographic pictures into his journal-cum-joke-book. \u201cIs it just me or is it getting crazier out there?\u201d he asks his unappreciated healthcare worker (fat-cat cuts are killing care-in-the-community programmes), sounding more like the illegitimate spawn of Travis Bickle every day. Meanwhile, Robert De Niro\u2019s smarmy talkshow host Murray Franklin flashes his wall-toothed grin on TV, reminding us all what The King of Comedy\u2019s Rupert Pupkin might have become after stealing Jerry Langford\u2019s crown while a nation watched.\n\nThe ghost of Pupkin hangs like a putrid spectre over Joker, from Arthur\u2019s fantastical dreams of stardom to the narrative\u2019s queasy themes of the media making heroes of villains in uncertain times. When wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) calls Gotham\u2019s impoverished masses \u201cclowns\u201d, his words echo around endless TV screens, providing a V for Vendetta-style mask to rioting protesters carrying \u201cKill the Rich\u201d placards. Meanwhile, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir\u2019s brilliantly brooding score seems to throb up from the pavements of these mean streets, full of ominous low strings and prowling bass growls \u2013 doom-laden voices prophesying war.\n\nThrough this desolate landscape dances Phoenix\u2019s lonely man, treading a path from victimisation to vengeance previously trodden by everyone from Charles Bronson in Death Wish to Michael Douglas in Falling Down. Yet while Jack Nicholson\u2019s weirdly lovable Joker may have described himself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first fully functioning homicidal artist\u201d in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman, Phoenix\u2019s Arthur is simply a pathological narcissist desperate to get his own back on the world.\n\nLike Pupkin, he craves unearned adoration and gets the same validating buzz from violence that fired Michael Rooker\u2019s titular monster in Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Whether stalking his single-mom neighbour Sophie (Zazie Beetz), stabbing a former colleague in the neck or prancing obscenely to the imagined sounds of Gary Glitter\u2019s Rock & Roll Part 2 (subtlety has never been part of Phillips\u2019s palette), Arthur is hardly a sympathetic figure. Rather, he is pitiful \u2013 a key distinction.\n\nVisually, Joker has a studiedly retro feel, from the Saul Bass-designed 1972 Warner logo that opens the picture to the long lenses used by cinematographer Lawrence Sher, repeatedly focusing on faces partially obscured by fuzzy foreground figures, as if the film was peering over someone\u2019s shoulder, spying on its subject. There are sly nods to key 1970s texts such as Sidney Lumet\u2019s Network, alongside movie theatre marquees advertising such early-80s releases as Blow Out and Zorro, the Gay Blade. We also get an extended sequence pointedly played out against a revival screening of Chaplin\u2019s 1936 classic Modern Times. As I said, subtlety is not Phillips\u2019s strong point.\n\nWhat he does have is an eye for a well-chosen location, an ear for a provocative line of dialogue and a finger on the pulse of very marketable, confrontational (if also \u201ccynical\u201d) entertainment. Add to this an incendiary central performance by Phoenix and Joker looks set to have the last laugh.", "description": "A mesmerising lead performance gives Todd Phillips\u2019s divisive reimagining of the comic villain raw power", "authors": ["Mark Kermode"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb3257f54c9790342b45f36152207ddc481c7125/0_646_5590_3354/master/5590.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0deb010e6d48ce3ca0b824afafee1f36", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
