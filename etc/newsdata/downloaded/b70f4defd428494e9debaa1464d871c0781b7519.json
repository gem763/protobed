What\u2019s worse: Bernie Sanders\u2019 heart attack, or the fact he\u2019s not being candid about it?\n\nJack Shafer is Politico\u2019s senior media writer.\n\nIf there were a 25th Amendment for presidential candidates\u2014that is, a mechanism to remove a physically unfit candidate from the campaign the way there is a constitutional mechanism to unseat a president who can\u2019t \u201cdischarge the powers and duties of his office\u201d\u2014we would be talking right now about subtracting Bernie Sanders from the campaign trail until he proves himself physically fit to assume the powers of chief executive of the United States.\n\nThe 78-year-old senator from Vermont was hospitalized last week after complaining about chest pains during an October 1 campaign event in Las Vegas. Doctors inserted two stents in one of Sanders\u2019 blocked arteries, but he, his campaign and his wife and close adviser Jane Sanders wouldn\u2019t say whether he had experienced a myocardial infarction\u2014the death of heart-muscle cells that we laymen call a heart attack. After three days of stonewalling from his campaign, Sanders publicly disclosed the fact he\u2019d had a heart attack\u2014something an urgent-care clinic diagnosed before he even entered the hospital.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThanks to the miracles of modern medicine, a heart attack shouldn\u2019t automatically blackball anybody from seeking or serving as president, as New York Times medical reporter Lawrence K. Altman M.D. writes. Both Dwight D. Eisenhower and Lyndon B. Johnson occupied the White House after their heart attacks, and Dick Cheney\u2019s four heart attacks (1978, 1984, 1988, 2000) didn\u2019t block him from serving as George W. Bush\u2019s vice president.\n\nBut neither is a heart attack a trivial medical condition, like a hangnail or a sprained ankle. Depending on its severity, recuperation can take weeks or months of rest. It requires lifestyle changes including reductions of stress and new dietary habits\u2014neither of which comport well with campaign life. Patients who have had heart attacks can be plagued with depression, fear and anger, the American Heart Association reports.\n\nSanders\u2019 heart attack might have been of the trifling variety\u2014if there is such a thing\u2014but we don\u2019t know that. And he isn\u2019t helping us calculate whether his health is sufficiently robust to pursue the presidency.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a week since Sanders was discharged from the hospital, and as the Washington Post reported on Thursday, his \u201ccampaign has yet to say how severe a heart attack Sanders suffered or what, if any, lifestyle changes his physicians have recommended.\u201d Facing calls to disclose his health records, Sanders said they would be released at \u201cthe appropriate time,\u201d but he won\u2019t say when that will be.\n\nSanders himself seems unsure about what all of this will mean for his run at the White House. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to change the nature of the campaign a bit,\u201d Sanders told reporters on Tuesday, promising to reduce his standard pace of holding three or four rallies a day. The next day, he nullified that pledge. Blaming the press for the confusion, he told NBC News, \u201cI misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and the media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it.\u201d He went on to say he would be returning to a \u201cvery vigorous campaign.\u201d\n\nAs for his lack of transparency about his heart event, \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Sanders told NBC News. He said he wasn\u2019t about to run to the New York Times and decant his medical condition every 15 minutes\u2014even though nobody was asking for that sort of granularity. \u201cI think we acted absolutely appropriately,\u201d he said.\n\nBut feel free to question Sanders\u2019 capacity to judge the status of his own health\u2014if only because he does. \u201cI must confess, I was dumb,\u201d Sanders said on Tuesday. \u201cI, in the last month or two, just was more fatigued than I usually have been. And I should have listened to those symptoms.\u201d\n\nNow that Sanders is listening to his symptoms, he should let us eavesdrop, too, or at least get a full readout of his health from his doctors so his supporters can glean a stronger sense of whether he\u2019ll survive his potential term in office or whether his health will trigger 25th Amendment action should heart disease strike him again.\n\nSanders isn\u2019t the only elderly presidential candidate who needs to answer the public\u2019s questions about his health. Joe Biden, who will be 78 on the next Inauguration Day, has suffered two brain aneurysms and is given to rambling when answering questions or giving speeches. Donald Trump, who will be 74 on Inauguration Day, has been opaque about his health, as the Washington Post editorial board complained in 2018.\n\nBut for the time being, Sanders remains the leading candidate for increased medical scrutiny. He\u2019s old and getting older, and we all know where that goes. He\u2019s a sick man. But we don\u2019t know how sick and he refuses to tell.\n\nPerhaps the most damning thing about Sanders\u2019 behavior over the past week is that it gives us a preview of how he might behave should illness strike him after he takes the presidential oath. Would he and his people deflect questions, postpone disclosure, and then blame the press for making a big deal about his health?\n\nI\u2019d like to say Bernie Sanders is better than that. I will, too, but first he must give me a good reason to do so.\n\n******\n\nEisenhower\u2019s White House tried to cover up his first-term heart attack, with his assistant press secretary telling reporters the president had suffered \u201ca digestive upset during the night.\u201d (Hat tip to John Dickerson\u2019s book \u201cWhistlestop: My Favorite Stories from Presidential Campaign History.\u201d) John Kennedy kept his Addison\u2019s disease secret.
