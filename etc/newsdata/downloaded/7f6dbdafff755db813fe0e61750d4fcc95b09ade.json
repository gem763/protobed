But oil and gas companies are striking back.\n\nThe oil industry is trying to crush the booming electric car movement.\n\nGroups backed by industry giants like Exxon Mobil and the Koch empire are waging a state-by-state, multimillion-dollar battle to squelch utility companies\u2019 plans to build charging stations across the country. Environmentalists call the fight a reprise of the \u201cWho Killed the Electric Car?\u201d battles that doomed an earlier generation of battery-driven vehicles in the 1990s.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOil-backed groups have challenged electric companies\u2019 plans in 10 states, according to utility commission filings reviewed by POLITICO, waging both regulatory and lobbying campaigns against the proposals. The showdown is taking place as utilities, eager to increase the demand for power, push for approval to build charging networks in locations such as shopping centers and rest stops in more than half the nation.\n\n\u201cFossil fuel interests control 90 percent of the transportation fuel market in the U.S. and are really feeling threatened,\u201d said Gina Coplon-Newfield, director of the electric vehicle initiative at the Sierra Club.\n\nThe counterattack involves an array of trade associations and industry-funded political groups representing every segment of the petroleum sector.\n\nIn the Midwest, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade group for gasoline makers, has filed comments against charging plans in Kansas and Missouri, and has opposed Colorado\u2019s new zero-emission vehicle mandate as part of a \u201cFreedom to Drive\u201d coalition of auto dealers and oil groups. Average consumers, they say, should not have to pay for incentives or charging stations that mainly benefit people wealthy enough to afford cars like Teslas.\n\nMorning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The owner of a large refinery joined other industrial interests to oppose utility charging and shared mobility plans in Minnesota.\n\nIn Massachusetts, API teamed up with gasoline marketers and convenience stores to oppose an electric vehicle charging buildout from the utility National Grid. The Western States Petroleum Association has opposed utility charging plans in Arizona alongside AFP, as well as electric vehicle legislation in California. And in Maryland, API aligned with convenience stores, gasoline stations and truck stop owners to oppose utilities\u2019 electric vehicle plans.\n\nThe oil groups are far from alone in critiquing the utility charging proposals. Consumer advocates and some independent charging firms argue that utilities, which operate as monopolies, are using electric vehicle infrastructure to pad their balance sheets because their captive customers will have to pay for the investments.\n\nUtilities say the upfront cost of charging stations is minimal for ratepayers, and that customers' bills may actually drop as electric vehicle adoption grows because the cost of power grid infrastructure will be spread over a larger base of power demand. In Maryland, four utilities proposed building 24,000 chargers last year at an estimated cost of 25 to 42 cents per ratepayer per month. The proposal from three Exelon utilities and one owned by FirstEnergy would have been the largest utility plan outside California, with power companies installing chargers in homes and apartment buildings and at workplaces and public locations like grocery stores or rest stops.\n\nSo far, the oil sector hasn\u2019t had seen much success combating utility plans. Though the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers celebrated a Kansas utility\u2019s decision to withdraw a charging plan last year, analysts say that in most cases where regulators scale back utility plans, they aren\u2019t doing it in response to the oil industry's pleas.\n\n\u201cSo far the main consequence [of oil lobbying] I've seen has been some delays, but I think the fight is ongoing,\u201d said Samantha Houston, a clean vehicles analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cI wouldn't attribute modifications to electric vehicle programs to API, but they are certainly making a good attempt to muddy the waters in their interventions.\u201d\n\nIn Maryland, regulators scaled back the utility proposal, only allowing them to build 5,000 chargers at public sites over the next few years. But the state\u2019s head regulator said the decision largely hinged on competition and price concerns, and that the oil industry\u2019s arguments were underdeveloped.\n\n\u201cI personally did not find those arguments to be compelling,\u201d said Maryland Public Service Commission Chairman Jason Stanek. \u201cThere is obviously a push toward the electrification of transportation and [these are] parochial concerns pushed by the petroleum industry to preserve its market share.\u201d\n\nEven so, Stanek, Houston and others expect oil companies to keep up the fight as the threat of electric vehicles grows.\n\n\u201cI think the struggle here will probably continue for a while,\u201d Houston said. \u201cInternal combustion engines still have a pretty significant market share and the oil and gas industry doesn't want to see that go anywhere.\u201d\n\nWhether gasoline-powered vehicles can hold on to their market is increasingly in doubt. By 2040, electric vehicles could make up as much as 40 percent of the U.S. passenger vehicle fleet and 60 percent of sales, up from 2 percent of sales today, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. That would erase demand for more than 3 million barrels of oil a day \u2014 or more than 20 percent of current transportation consumption.\n\nOil groups are also fighting in Congress to oppose tax credits for electric vehicles, pushing lawmakers to increase electric vehicle fees \u2014 26 states have them today \u2014 and supporting the Trump administration\u2019s proposed rollback of Obama-era fuel efficiency standards. Auto dealers are one of the prime business sectors allied with President Donald Trump on the rollback.\n\nThe motivation for the lobbying push stems from an existential threat facing the global oil sector in the rise of the electric vehicle.\n\nElectric vehicle mandates in China and many European Union nations have set a target of phasing out gasoline vehicles by 2040 or sooner. That will continue driving battery prices down in the coming years, said David Doherty, an oil specialist at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. And that, he said, should create a tipping point in the middle of the next decade as passenger electric vehicles become widely competitive with gas-powered ones \u2014 meaning the oil industry has only a few years to stem the tide.\n\n\"Then we'll see electric vehicles really ramp up as a percentage of sales,\u201d Doherty said.\n\nWith electric vehicles on the road to competitiveness, the biggest roadblock to greater adoption is deploying enough chargers to fuel their growth. That, Stanek said, helps explain the oil sector\u2019s intensified lobbying campaign.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Larry Hogan wants to see 300,000 electric vehicles in 2025 \u2014 up from less than 20,000 today. \u201cAs more drivers see public charging pop up at gas stations, libraries and on the side of the road, it'll prompt consumers to think twice when making their next vehicle purchase.\u201d\n\nPublicly, both sides are coy about the confrontation. Oil supporters downplay the threat from electric vehicles, arguing they still aren\u2019t as functional as internal combustion engine cars and pointing out that many analysts expect that global fossil fuel demand will continue to be strong mid-century.\n\n\u201cI actually think the internal combustion engine is going to be around a long time, barring some kind of a major breakthrough of electric vehicle technology that hasn\u2019t happened yet and doesn't look like it's likely in the near future,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI think internal combustion engines remain very, very competitive for decades to come.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group, says it\u2019s too early to know if electric and gasoline-powered vehicles are headed for a collision.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s us and them,\u201d said EEI senior director Becky Knox. \u201cAt this point in the market, [electric vehicles] are still relatively new. I don't know if that is a collision course.\u201d\n\nEven so, veterans of the power sector say it\u2019s obvious that utilities have stepped up their electric vehicle lobbying in recent years. Whereas utility electric vehicle charging was rare outside of California at mid-decade, more than 50 utilities in 25 states and the District of Columbia have now proposed charging programs. EEI and its members have also quietly lobbied Congress to extend and expand electric vehicle incentives, and they\u2019ve fought directly with oil groups to defeat model legislation against utilities\u2019 electric vehicle plans at meetings of business leaders and conservative lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThe electric utilities are not doing this out of altruism,\u201d Stanek said. \u201cThere is a benefit in terms of a return in allowing them to [charge ratepayers] for certain vehicle infrastructure.\u201d\n\nSome observers say utilities\u2019 initial apprehension about pushing electric vehicles has led the power companies to overdo their requests to bill ratepayers for the charging buildout.\n\n\u201cThey finally have worked through the blindingly obvious benefits, and having been recalcitrant, are now reaping incentives and concessions that should not have been necessary in the first place,\u201d said Karl R\u00e1bago, a former Texas utility regulator and senior policy advisor at the Pace Energy and Climate Center. \u201cFeels a bit like rope-a-dope.\u201d\n\nThe utilities\u2019 shift toward electric vehicles has put environmental groups in an awkward position: After fighting utilities for years to adopt renewable energy, most have come to view them as powerful allies to cut transportation pollution.\n\n\u201cSierra Club has a long and rich history of suing utilities and opposing utilities when [they] are propping up fossil fuels,\u201d Coplon-Newfield said. \u201cBut when it comes to the acceleration of electric vehicles, we've actually found some common ground.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists say many of the oil sector\u2019s arguments against electric vehicles recall the 1990s, when fossil fuel groups and automakers waged a successful campaign to scale back California\u2019s ambitious zero-emission vehicle mandate \u2014 as recounted in the popular documentary \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\"\n\nBack then, California was set to mandate that an increasing percentage of cars sold in the state be non-gasoline vehicles, culminating in 10 percent in 2003. But state air regulators backed down after a dedicated lobbying campaign from car companies and oil interests, who opposed electric vehicle charging plans and argued there was no demand for the vehicles.\n\nOne key change since then is the position of the automotive sector. While U.S. automakers fought hard against the California regulations in the past, they are increasingly receptive to state electric vehicle targets, particularly when they are paired with incentives for the vehicles' purchase.\n\nTen other states today follow zero-emission vehicle targets set by California, which now mandate that electric vehicles make up about 8 percent of new vehicle sales by 2025. In August, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the sector\u2019s leading trade group, signed on to support a zero-emission target in Colorado because it included incentives for purchasing electric vehicles.\n\nBut like the oil sector, electric vehicles are also splitting the auto industry. Car dealerships make much of their revenue from servicing gasoline-powered engines and publicly oppose electric vehicle mandates and utility charging programs in Colorado and elsewhere.\n\nWith the automakers singing a new tune and the price of electric vehicles continuing to fall, Stanek says state regulators should be ready for the front lines of the battle between utilities and the oil industry to spread to their states soon.\n\n\u201cThe petroleum lobby and the electric utility lobby \u2014 I\u2019m talking about API vs. EEI \u2014 we are going to see a competition between them for market share like we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d he said.", "description": "Electric vehicles could make up nearly half the fleet of passenger cars and trucks by 2040.
