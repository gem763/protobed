It sounds like he\u2019s referring to robber barons who have descended on the state to suck it dry of profits while burning it to the ground. But Newsom is talking about one of the most regulated industries in the state \u2014 namely California\u2019s energy utilities that answer to the state\u2019s public utilities commission.\n\nThis is not exactly an Ayn Rand operation. The state could have, if it wanted, pushed the utilities to focus on the resilience and safety of its current infrastructure \u2014 implicated in some of the state\u2019s most fearsome recent fires \u2014 as a top priority. Instead, the commission forced costly renewable-energy initiatives on the utilities. Who cares about something as mundane as properly maintained power lines if something as supposedly epically important \u2014 and politically fashionable \u2014 as saving the planet is at stake?", "description": "", "authors": ["Rich Lowry", "Nationalreview.Com California-Cant-Keep-The-Lights-On"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
