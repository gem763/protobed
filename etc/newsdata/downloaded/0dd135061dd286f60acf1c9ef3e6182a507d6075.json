He's going to be a very good prime minister. That's my prediction,\" he says.\n\nMr Makris has spent almost five decades building up a vast empire from property development and shopping centre ownership after arriving as a teenager in 1964 in Adelaide from Greece.\n\nHumble chicken shop start\n\nHis first venture into commerce was as the owner of a chicken shop. Mr Makris said the Makris Group was stepping up its investment in various shopping centres and commercial properties now, to be ready for a renewed upturn in the economy from the start of 2020.\n\n\"We're sitting on things now mainly. We're investing in our properties. Now is the time to do it,'' Mr Makris says.\n\nHe has been doing minor reshuffles of the Makris property empire, including the sale of an office tower at 431 King William Street in Adelaide's CBD for $43.1 million to property investment house Quintessential Equity in late 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also offloaded the Le Cornu development site in affluent north Adelaide in late 2017 to the Adelaide City Council, which had become tired of that prime site laying dormant after several attempts at grand plans over three decades under several different owners.\n\nMr Makris has an astute international perspective through his Greek heritage and emphasises the important of a steady leader on the national political stage as the world goes through unprecedented changes in the digital age.\n\nMr Makris saw first hand the turmoil in Greece, when that country's economy was in serious strife in 2015, while on visits to his homeland.\n\nMr Morrison was a big plus for confidence levels in business, and this would spill into the wider economy.\n\n\"Business confidence will start lifting and then the whole economy. I really believe that,'' he says.\n\nLower interest rates will keep borrowing costs lower for people but should the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates as most economists are tipping, the impact is only slight given they are at such historical lows.\n\nAustralia dodges uncertainty\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe says Australia was able to dodge a period of unwelcome uncertainty with the loss by Bill Shorten and his high-taxing, high-spending plans, which would have removed incentives for people to work hard and get ahead.\n\nBut Mr Makris says he's always mindful of the political cycle and how it can shift, with the Australian economy so interconnected into global economic cycles.\n\n\"You never know who people will vote for the next time around,\" he says.\n\nIn late 2016, Mr Makris shifted his head office to Queensland after 45 years of being based in Adelaide because he saw more opportunities in that state in a more vibrant economy. He also put in place an independent advisory board.\n\nMr Makris is a big believer in private ownership of the Makris empire so he can make long-term investments without the need to satisfy investors with a shorter-term horizon than those running ASX-listed companies face.\n\nFind out who are Australia's richest people in the Financial Review Rich List 2019, out on Friday.", "description": "The property billionaire started with one chicken shop and has built a $1.3 billion fortune in property and shopping centres.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_428%2C$y_222/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/524d4b7f328fe1c13092457fd62061ccf3b88b2b", "published_at": "2019-05-23"}
